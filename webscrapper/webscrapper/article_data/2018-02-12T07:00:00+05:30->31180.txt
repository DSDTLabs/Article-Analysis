Ludhiana: Even as the civic officials issued more than 1,000 no objection certificates (NOCs) to the   for contesting MC polls, they could generate only Rs 74.19 lakh from various sources through these applicants. The officials claimed that the process of issuing NOCs is still on, and more money is expected to be generated from the same. Meanwhile, the parties have just started announcing their candidates from various wards

 The department issued around 1,088 NOCs in all four zones and the maximum number of NOCs that is 340 were issued in the zone B . As many as 253 NOCs in zone A, 223 NOCs in zone C and 272 NOCs in zone D were issued, since the elections were announced. The applicants who want to contest elections require NOC from the municipal corporation MC to certify that there are no outstanding dues against them. Hence, the officials had pinned their hopes on the recovery of dues from the ticket aspirants while issuing them the NOCs. However, they could not generate much. 
 
 One of the officials on conditions of anonymity claimed that they were hoping to generate at least Rs 1 crore to 2 crore from these NOCs. But, they could recover less amount because they had to accept whatever was paid to them. “If we would have been given free hand to check the actual records of the aspirants, then recovery would have been much better,” he added. 
 
 One of the officials said they recovered Rs 1.18 lakh from house tax amount, and it has come from zone B only. While, in other zones, not even a single rupee has been collected. Besides this, Rs 40.15 lakh has been recovered from from property tax, Rs 27.08 lakh has been from water supply and sewerage dues, and Rs 5.78 lakh has been the recovery of building branch so far. 
 
 The MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they have issued more than 1,000 NOCs in a few days and instructions are passed that these should be issued on the spot. Regarding recovery, he said they have collected whatever was pending in the names of these applicants.
