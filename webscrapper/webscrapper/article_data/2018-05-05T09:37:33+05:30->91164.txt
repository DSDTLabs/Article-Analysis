NEW DELHI: In 15 months time, Survey of India, the country’s principal mapping agency, will map the entire stretch of the Ganga using geographic information system (GIS) technology and provide high-resolution maps to the government. 

 
 It will help river cleaning authorities in getting minute details of sewage and effluent discharge outlets and identify pollution hot-spots up to 10 km on both sides of the river. “The high resolution map will help us in keeping tabs on sources of pollution and taking quick corrective measures. Such scientific map is necessary for effective execution and monitoring of the river cleaning works,” said  , director general of the   ( ). 
 
 Mishra told TOI on Friday that though mapping the entire stretch of the river Ganga is quite a lengthy work, the survey of India would complete it in 15 months. “We’ll, in fact, start getting lot of information within one year itself. It’ll not only help the NMCG but also the states in taking quick decisions on many civic issues based on scientific data and the high resolution map”, he said. 
 
 
  
 
 Since the project will map sewage outlets and other discharges from all units (industrial, commercial and others) from the source to the public drainage network, it will help in monitoring of polluting sources and quicken the process of taking appropriate action. 
 
 The NMCG has approved Rs 86.84 crore for this work in its executive committee meeting this week. It’s part of the Mission’s latest approval of other key projects worth over Rs 530 crore for five main Ganga stem basin states - Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
