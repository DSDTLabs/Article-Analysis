 ' ', said that it was a moment of epiphany for her while attending the last period of the day at school. "I had this Howard Beale-like moment... I have a revelation that I needed to move to Los Angeles as soon as possible because that's where I needed to go," Emma said. 
 
 Calling her decision 'crazy', she recounts how she convinced her parents to let her go, despite having no exposure to movie or TV cameras. The 'Birdman' star added that she rushed home from school and started working on a PowerPoint presentation that she titled 'Project Hollywood'. "It's nuts that they agreed to it... I don't condone it. Everybody should go through high school and graduate," Emma laughed. 
 
 Stone also went on to say that she was nervous as a child and was prone to panic attacks and debilitating shyness. But Emma said she owes managing her nervous breakdowns to her after-school youth theater classes, finding it easy for her to slip into the skin of other characters and gave her another path to interact with others. 
 
 "I think my parents saw that acting was the thing that made me fulfilled and happy," Emma said.
