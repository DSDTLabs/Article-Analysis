PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of   (CCP) has shifted 17 mobile   from the children’s park near the   to the vicinity of   school and Vaidya hospital. The   (PHATA) had raised the issue of the kiosks creating a nuisance in the locality, serving food cooked in unhygienic conditions and operating well into the night.

 Panaji mayor Vithal Chopdekar said it was decided to move the kiosks that were temporarily operating from children’s park as residents had complained that the space meant for children was being misused. The park will be developed by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation, Chopdekar said.
 
 CCP’s vending committee has declared the new space as a vending zone, and it was earlier decided that some kiosks would be shifted to the market road near Inox. Following protests from PHATA, the corporation swung into action, distributing licence plates with all details, including the type of operation, licensee number, name of licensee, items they’re dealing with, and timings of operation.
