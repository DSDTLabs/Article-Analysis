NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday quashed a contempt of court petition filed against   ( ) by social activist Janardhan Moon over the issue of booking Suresh Bhat Auditorium for an event on April 29.

 Moon, through his counsel Ashwin Ingole, had approached the court citing contempt by NMC as it refused to allot the hall to his organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), even though the HC had earlier ordered NMC to do so. NMC’s counsel Akshay Naik told the bench comprising justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and justice Arun Upadhyay that the civic body’s only objection was to Moon availing concessional rate for the hall. As per the rule, concessional booking rate is applicable only to registered charitable trusts, and Moon had failed to produce any document proving the same.
 
 The HC ruled that this did not comprise ‘contempt of court’ and provided liberty to petitioner Moon to book Bhat auditorium at non-concessional rates.
 
 Speaking to TOI regarding the registration, Moon said, “My organization RSS’ registration application was accepted online but was later rejected by the charity commissioner. The matter is currently in litigation.” Moon said he had arranged for the payment through demand draft based on the amount quoted by NMC in writing. “Later, they refused the hall saying you have to pay a different amount, which left my organization with very few choices,” said Moon.
 
 NMC’s counsel mentioned that along with the amount, a certificate of being registered as a charitable trust too has to be submitted.
