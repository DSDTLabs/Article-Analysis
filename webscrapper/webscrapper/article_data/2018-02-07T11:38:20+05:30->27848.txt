PUNE: Inspired by the success of the Wanworie police division of forming special teams and recovering over 100 stolen vehicles, its   counterpart has adoped the same measure to curb vehicle thefts.

 The result was recovery of 29 stolen two-wheelers, detection of two burglary cases and arrest of nine men of three gangs within a little over a week in the Khadki, Vishrantwadi, Yerawada, Vimannagar, Chandannagar and Dighi areas.
 
 Deputy commisisoner of police (Zone IV)   and assistant commissioner of police (Khadki division) Ganesh Gawade reviewed the theft cases and found that most of the criminals were either from outside Pune or were visiting the city.
  
  
 Gawade told TOI, “The police teams have downloaded various apps on smartphones and laptops to identify stolen vehicles. Their members are visiting towns, villages and weekly bazaars along the Pune-Ahmednagar Road for collecting information on the criminals involved in buying and selling of stolen vehicles.”
 
 He said if the number of a suspected vehicle was fed in the app, it helped the police ascertain if it was was stolen or not. “We have so far busted three gangs comprising three members each. The gangs are from West Bengal with its members staying at Wade-Bolai, Shirur in Pune rural and Parner in  . We have recovered 29 motorcycles and hope to trace more,” Gawade said.
 
 Explaining the gangs’ modus operandi, he said, they visit Pune at regular intervals and steal unlocked vehicles, mostly motorcycles, from parking places by using duplicate keys. They would then ride back to their villages and sell the bikes to labourers and farmers at cheap rates and without registration documents.”
 
 In January, Wanowrie police division had recovered over 100 stolen vehicles.
