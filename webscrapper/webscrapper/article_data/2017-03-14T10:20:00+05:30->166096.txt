HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has come up with a new scheme for newborns and mothers to reduce child and maternal mortality rates. The 'KCR kit' will have 16 items, including diapers, with a funds allocation of Rs 605 crore. 

 The kit to be given for three months will comprise baby shampoo, baby oil, powder, napkin, dresses, mosquito net, small mattress, diapers, towel and toys. Also, handbag and cotton sarees for mothers.
 
 The scheme is modelled around the 'Amma Kit' distributed for babies and mothers in Tamil Nadu. A team of higher officials from health department and chief minister's office visited Tamil Nadu to study the scheme introduced by late chief minister Jayalalithaa. Women and child welfare department or health department will be the nodal agency to supply the kits.
 
 The government will also provide aid to pregnant women who visit government hospitals. A total of 12,000 will be disbursed in three phases - 4,000 upon visitng hospital, Rs 4000 after being discharged and 3000 for vaccination of the baby. 
 
 The government will also supply superfine rice through anganwadis for babies, pregnant women and new mothers. Anganwadi workers will be elevated as anganwadi teachers. 
 
 The government has allotted Rs 1731.5 crore for women and child welfare for the coming fiscal, a slight increase from last year's allocation of Rs 1553 crore. 
 
 State government also allocated Rs 5976.17 crore for health department in 2017-18 budget. Key aspects of the outlay will be construction of three more super-specialty hospitals in Hyderabad and one in Karimnagar. Fifty more new vehicles will be arranged to take bodies from government hospitals to homes. New beds, saline stands, bedsheets will be given in place of spoiled ones.
