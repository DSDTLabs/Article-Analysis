  : As promised, chief minister   on Wednesday convened a   with   and   of the hill districts to discuss relevant issues. Biren had said last month that the 10th of every month would be reserved exclusively for this meeting. 

 Addressing the group of leaders at his official bungalow-cum-office here, the chief minister said his government has committed itself to the development of hill areas to bridge disparities in development between hill and valley districts. Biren heard the grievances of 500 people representing around 50 different civil organizations from 8am to 1pm, a statement issued by the CM secretariat said.
 
 Stating that no community is big or small, Biren said every ethnic community in the state should live with dignity and the government would help them achieve that. A file of copies of all representations by the leaders will be maintained in his office so that he can contact concerned official any time for followup action, Biren added. He also appealed to his council of ministers and MLAs to help resolve people's woes by consulting them in a transparent manner.
 
 Besides this earmarked day, Biren had also announced that the 15th of every month would be 'Meeyamgi Numit' or People's Day, when people across the state can meet him, ministers or top state officials. Urging the elected leaders and government officials to listen to people's complaints on the first 'Meeyamgi Numit' (May 15), Biren asked them to publicize the schedule and venue in the media a day in advance, the statement said.
