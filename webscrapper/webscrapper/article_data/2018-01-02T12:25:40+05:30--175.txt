KOTTAYAM:   general secretary G Sukumaran   said that the existing reservation policies are unscientific and it needs to be renewed. He also said that the NSS will take legal steps to end this "rotten reservation system". He lauded chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for approving 10% reservation for the economically weak from the forward communities for recruitment in the devaswom boards. He termed it as a "historic decision which embarked a change". 

 Nair was addressing the delegates' meet of the NSS held as part of   celebrations at the NSS headquarters in Perunna on Monday. "Whoever rules, forward communities won't get any benefit. Increase the reservation for those eligible to any extent. However, it is ill-will to say that nothing will be given to those economically weak in forward class. Though the state government is ready to give those section, others are not allowing it, he said. He also rubbished the propaganda that the majority of the staff in the devaswom board are from forward communities. Earlier, people from other sections did not show any interest in the devaswom jobs as the salary was less," he said. 
 
 He also said that the NSS was expecting that the reservation in devaswom board would be implemented soon. "If not, we know to make it 50% through legal proceedings," said Nair. 
 
  Mannam Jayanthi meet will be held on Tuesday. Aswathi  , member of the ruling family of erstwhile Travancore, will inaugurate it. Changanassery archbishop   will deliver the keynote address.
