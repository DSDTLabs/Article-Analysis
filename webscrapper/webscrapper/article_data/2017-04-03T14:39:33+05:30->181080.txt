CHENNAI: In a bid to put pressure on the Chennai police and courts to start trial in a   pending against him since 2009,   general secretary   surrendered before the court on Monday and refused to apply for bail. This left the magistrate with no other option but to remand him in judicial custody for a fortnight.

 The matter relates to the release of Vaiko’s book ‘Naan Kutram Sattugiren’ (I am accusing you), which is a compilation of the MDMK leader’s letters to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009. 
 
 The book was released at a function in Rani Seethai Hall in Chennai in 2009. The Thousand Lights police slapped him with the case for his ‘seditious’ speech punishable under Section 124(A) of the IPC. The police completed investigation and filed a chargesheet in 2010. Since then there had been no sign of trial in the case.
 
 Though the magistrate court’s role is limited to committing the matter to a sessions court for trial, even that process has not been completed.
 
 On Monday, Vaiko appeared before XIII metropolitan magistrate Gopinath and offered to surrender by filing a surrender petition. The magistrate then offered to release him on bail on MDMK leader’s own bail. 
 
 Vaiko, however, turned down the offer and did not file any bail application. This left the magistrate with little choice but to remand the MDMK leader in judicial custody.
 
 Vaiko resorted to this act since courts and police had shown no urgency in starting the trial, said MDMK spokesperson and advocate Nanmaran. Despite repeated attempts from Vaiko’s side, the prosecution had made no effort to proceed with trial, he said.
