MUMBAI: Nine months after heads of civic schools handed back to the BMC the e-learning tablets of students who had left,   are scrambling to find misplaced   cards. The alternative is to pay for the lost cards from their own pocket, said a headmistress.

 The BMC distributes tablets to Class VIII students with their syllabus on a 16 GB   card. The content on the   is updated by the BMC every year for the next class, but schools that are only till Class VIII hand back the tablets. 
 
 BMC officials said the tablets are the responsibility of the school heads.
