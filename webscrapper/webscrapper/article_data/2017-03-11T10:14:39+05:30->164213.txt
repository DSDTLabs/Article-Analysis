  floor leader in the Assembly, G  , wondered if the questions in the survey included the promised two bedroom houses, three acres land to Dalits and the bad roads and constant traffic jams in the city. 
 
 "Unless the basis of the survey and the questions are known, it is hard to analyse or react to the findings," he said dismissing the survey.
 
 Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, K Jana Reddy of the Congress, said he will not go by the findings of a survey ordered by the chief minister. "For me, people are the final decision makers," he said. Hinting that the surveys were done at government expense, Jana Reddy wanted to know if "government funds can be spent to conduct such surveys." This is just another example of wasteful government expenditure, he added.
 
 Minister  , in turn, wondered why the opposition was getting worked up over a party internal survey.
