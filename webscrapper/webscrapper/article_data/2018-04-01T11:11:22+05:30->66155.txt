NAGPUR: A 27-year-old BEd second year student died under mysterious circumstances at the university hostel near   on Saturday. The student, son of a head constable, was found frothing in lower hostel room no. 170 on the first floor.

  Aade, a native of   town in   district, was rushed to the   (GMCH) where the doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 The Ambazari police have registered a case of accidental death. No suicide not was recovered from the spot, but the cops confiscated his mobile phone from his room. PSI Ravindra Meshram said the report of the autopsy, which was performed on Saturday, will ascertain the reason behind his death.
 
 At the time of filing the report, his autopsy was still underway.
 
 Balu had been staying in the boys’ hostel since 2016 after getting admission in BEd course. On Saturday morning, the deceased’s friend  , studying in MA first year, claimed that he went upstairs to see another friend. While crossing from the passage, he entered Balu’s room and found him lying face down on his bed and frothing.
 
 Chauhan, who is staying at room no. 128 on the ground floor, told TOI, “I tried to wake him up but his body was cold. I immediately alerted other boys and took him to a private hospital from where he was referred to GMCH, but in vain.”
 
 TOI tried to contact the deceased’s father but the number was not reachable.
 
 Hostel warden Dr SI Koreti said, “The student does not have any bad record. He was very jolly. He had come back to the hostel from his place a few days ago. He was staying alone in the room as his roommate had gone home. He was probably depressed by some unspecified family reasons.”
