 The film and television industry is feeling left out after the entertainment sector failed to make its way into Arun Jaitley’s   speech on Wednesday.
 
 “The budget does not mention any specific focus or incentives for the growth of the film and television sector, which in my opinion was long overdue,” said Siddharth Roy Kapur, president, The Film and Television Producers Guild of India who had greater expectations from this year’s Union budget.
 
 For a sector, that represents the soft power of the country, to achieve its full potential, he stressed on the “crucial need” for the government to look at supporting it across various areas. “We are one of the most under-screened film markets in the world, despite having such a prolific local industry. It is important, just as China has done, for the government to consider incentivizing the exhibition sector to open screens in markets that are currently underserved.”
 
 
 Calling to attention some of the other industry based issues that needed addressing Kapur pointed at, “Protection of intellectual   and stricter laws on   with the industry and hence the exchequer, losing out on significant revenues due to rampant physical and digital piracy” as the need of the hour. “And finally, a rational tax regime for the industry that supports sustained growth and encourages investment in this sector.”
 
 However, what spelt relief for the film industry was that service tax, which was already on the higher side, had not been touched for the interim period in view of the introduction of GST (goods & services tax) in the coming financial year. “We now hope that the film sector will be fairly taxed under the GST regime,” said Kapur on an optimistic note.
