 CITY: Guatemala's highest court has halted the government's request that   remove its ambassador.

 
 The Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that the administration of President   must follow established international rules in resolving the issue.
 
 In early May, the government asked Sweden and   to remove their ambassadors and accused them of interfering in Guatemala's internal affairs.
 
 Swedish ambassador   was given 30 days to leave after he announced Sweden's financial support for a   sponsored commission investigating corruption in Guatemala.
 
 The commission, which goes by the initials CICIG, had accused President Jimmy Morales of corruption related to alleged illegal campaign financing while he was secretary general of his party.
 
 Morales subsequently tried unsuccessfully to expel the commission's head,  , from the country.
