GUWAHATI: Arunachal Pradesh   has raised the pitch for expanding   in areas still outside   in the   

 Ering had recently written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that "vested interests are bent on denying mobile connectivity" to the people of the northeast and, in particular, to Arunachal Pradesh.
 
 "Following a delay of over 18 months in calling tenders (April 2016) after cabinet approval (September 2014), there has been a further delay of over five months even after tenders were evaluated," Ering wrote to the PM.
 
 Ering added that the northeast is a sensitive region, sharing international borders, and yet the region is not completely exposed to cellular technology. Union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi had in November last year pointed out that there are communication voids in areas along the India-Myanmar international border, especially in southern Arunachal Pradesh, southeastern Nagaland, western and southern Manipur and southern Mizoram.
 
 According to statistics on the comprehensive telecom plan for the northeast, there are an estimated 8,621 villages in the region which do not have mobile coverage.   alone has 2,805 villages, followed by Assam (2,503), Meghalaya (2,374), Manipur (528), Mizoram (252), Nagaland (134), Sikkim (23) and Tripura (2).
 
 The Centre has planned it will install 6,673 telecom towers in the northeast at an estimated cost of Rs 4, 770.08 crore to cater to the uncovered villages of the region. 
 
 There is another plan to set up 321 telecom towers at an estimated cost of Rs 270.13 crore for mobile coverage along national highways in the northeast.
