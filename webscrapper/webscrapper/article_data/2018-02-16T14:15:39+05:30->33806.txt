AMARAVATI: The Teachersâ€™ Eligibility Test (TET), as announced earlier, will be held from   to March 3, said minister for HRD   Srinivasa Rao. The minister held a   meeting with officials on Thursday on the implementation of  .

 The meeting dealt with issues of improper allotment of centres to some TET applicants, and mistakes in a few hall tickets. One of the complaints the HRD ministry received was that many applicants were not allotted centres they had chosen, and many were given centres away from the places reside or even in different states. The exam will be held in 183 centres, of which some 24 are in other states.
 
 When the minister expressed anger over the centre allocations, the officials said these allotments were made because of lack of sufficient centres and online computer seating capacity in some districts. The officials said that out of 4,46,833, only 15,605 applicants, about 3.5%, have been allotted centres outside the state, and that they have also been given the option to change the centres.
 
 Applicants will be allotted centres based on the option they choose, and the exam for those who change the centres will be conducted on March 2, officials said.
 
 The minister told the officials that this is the first time that the exams are being conducted online and they should be careful of any issues that might arise.
