Panaji: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee on Monday asked health minister   to stop spreading rumours about Congress MLAs and leaders, and to focus on his constituency and his ministry. “Vishwajit Rane said that there are 2-3 Congress MLAs who are in touch with Amit Shah and who will join the BJP. I want to ask him, who are those three MLAs who met Shah on Sunday, and why is Rane lying?” Congress spokesperson Urfan Mulla said. Mulla also suggested that the BJP was worried with the Congress’ aggressive stance and had thus resorted to spreading rumours to create confusion. tnn
