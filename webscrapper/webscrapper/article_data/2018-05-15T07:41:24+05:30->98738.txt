HUBBALLI: While the general public have exercised their franchise across the state to elect the next government in the state, over 700   personnel are in fear of losing their chance of   as postal ballots are yet to reach them. The last date to send the postal ballot is May 15.

 There are 20 police stations in the district and over 2,000 police personnel are rendering service. However, the higher-ups have reportedly failed to ensure the supply of postal ballots to the personnel. Some police personnel, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that Form 12 needs to be filled up to cast votes through postal ballots. The personnel filled up the form and sent it to the election officer a week ago. However, the postal ballots are yet to be sent to them. It is alleged that lack of coordination between the establishment officer and city special branch officer is behind the delay in sending the postal ballots.
 
 Over 40% of the police personnel are in the fear of losing their chance of voting.
 
 “I have filled up the Form 12 a week ago. I’m yet to get the ballots. While people voted today, I’m yet to vote,” a constable attached to a police station in the city told TOI on Saturday on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 Dharwad deputy commissioner S B   told TOI that about 2,000 Form 12 were sent police personnel. “The last date to send the Form 12 was also extended. The district administration has done its duty and the onus is on the police department to ensure that the ballots are sent to the personnel,” he added.
 
 However, Hubballi-Dharwad police commissioner   claimed that the ballots are sent to all personnel in the limits of the commissionerate. “If a few have not received, they have time till May 15 to send the ballots and so need not worry,” he said.
