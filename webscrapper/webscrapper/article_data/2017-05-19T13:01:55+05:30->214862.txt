Basil Joseph's second directorial   has a full-of-life first half with gusti, good songs and a fresh story! The two-hour-long movie has a lot of situational humour, stemming both from the cricket field and the godha dust.   presents a good performance as  , the reluctant wrestler cum passionate cricketer. As Aditi Singh, Wamiqa is a revelation and kudos to the team for the apt casting. 

 The first half of the film is partly set in the wrestling-crazy Kerala village of Kannadikkallu and in a campus in Punjab. The movie's colour tone, for some reason, has an eighties feel; will it work in the film's favour? Can't say yet. The interval punch and the songs kind of give away the climax of the storyline to an extend, but not in a way that takes away your enthusiasm to watch how it will all unfold.
