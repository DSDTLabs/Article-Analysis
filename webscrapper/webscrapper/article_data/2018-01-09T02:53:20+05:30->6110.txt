MUMBAI: Contrary to allegations that the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) has ignored Muslims in its over-three-year rule at the Centre and state, the party leadership claims that the community has made progress since   became the prime minister in May 2014.

 Speakers at a ‘Muslim Development Seminar’ held by the   on Monday said that there was a feeling of “elation” among Muslims on several decisions taken by the government, including the triple talaq bill and the permission to women to go for Haj without mahram, or male relative.
 
 “Instant triple talaq is anti-Islamic and the credit goes to the Narendra Modi government that, after the Supreme Court declared it illegal, the government passed the triple talaq bill in the Lok Sabha. It is also a big step that the government has allowed women pilgrims to go for Haj without mahram. These steps will help empower Muslim women,” said Haider Azam, BJP city vice-president. He added that there were several schemes, both of the Centre and the state government, which had benefited the minorities too. 
 
 Asked why they needed to hold a seminar on Muslim development, Waseem R Khan, president, BJP Mumbai Minority Morcha, said that the community needed to be made aware of how they could benefit more from the central and state government schemes. 
 
 “This seminar is not just to celebrate what has been achieved but also to create awareness about what more can be done to get the community empowered more,” said Khan.
 
 Minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who was in the city on Monday to supervise the Hunar Haat, an exhibition-cum-sale of handicrafts at Islam Gymkhana that is on till Wednesday, also called the triple talaq bill and the permission to women to go on Haj without mahram big “victories”. 
 
 “Women are very happy with these decisions,” he said.
