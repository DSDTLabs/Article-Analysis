BEIJING: China said on Monday that it has not been able to persuade   to allow its stranded soldier,  , to return home despite persistent efforts. 

  Wang Qi, a surveyor with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), was captured in India after he crossed the border in 1963. More than 53 years later, Wang lives in India in Tirodi village, a five-hour drive from Nagpur. 
 
  "In recent years, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi had kept in close touch with Wang and made relentless efforts to help him return to China, including pushing the Indian side on exit and entry procedures for him," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said. He said the Chinese embassy gave him a 10-year visa in 2013. 
 
 But it was not clear why it took the Chinese embassy so long to provide the necessary papers to Wang, who has been in India since he was released from jail in 1969.
