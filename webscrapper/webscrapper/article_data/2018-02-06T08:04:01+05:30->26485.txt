BHOPAL:   has approached   whistle-blower Dr   for inputs on the alleged leak of 2017-AIIMS MBBS entrance exam paper.

 On May 31, 2017, Dr Rai had alleged that the question papers of this exam were leaked and released screenshots of the question papers on May 29 — a day after the exam was held — questioning how these snapshots came out in public. “I wonder why   director Dr   was in such a hurry to declare the results of the disputed exam when he knew that the matter was under investigation,” said Dr Rai, adding that two CBI officers contacted him for details on the matter. “I received screenshots of the leaked paper from my informer. I have given his contact to CBI,” he added. 
 
 After Rai’s allegations, AIIMS had constituted a committee to probe how snapshots of the question paper came out in public. AIIMS authorities rejected allegations of a leak and declared the results on June 15 even as the probe was on. The committee found that a candidate had smuggled a camera into an exam centre in Uttar Pradesh with the help of officials.
 
 Of the 2.85 lakh candidates who appeared, 4,905 qualified for counselling session. Dr Rai claims to have received the question paper screenshots from a source, who said they were leaked from a college in Lucknow when the online test was on. He had tagged the Prime Minister’s Office in his tweet, while pressing for a CBI enquiry.
 
 Dr Rai said it reminds him of the Vyapam scam. “It took five years for the   government to cancel admission of 600 students who had cleared exams through fraudulent means via Vyapam. Had they taken action in time, at least 300 genuine students would have become doctors. AIIMS has made the same mistake, jeopardising the career of students who wanted to clear the exam through fair means,” he said.
