VIJAYAWADA: Denying charges of  ,   and   on Thursday clarified that the value of his   had gone up due to the rise in the  . 

 Speaking to reporters here, Lokesh alleged that YSRC leader Jaganmohan Reddy launched a malicious campaign against him. He dared Jagan for a public debate on the assets owned by both. "They are repeating a lie 100 times to hoodwink the public. We have not earned even a single rupee through illegal means," asserted the scion of Nara family. He said his family had been declaring the family assets for the past 20 years which no public representative did in the country. Admitting that the value of the assets had gone up manifold in the last few months, Lokesh clarified that it was chiefly due to the rise in the share prices of the listed Heritage Foods. "My father and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had transferred his shares to me in 1999. I have 24 lakh shares in Heritage. The share value has increased from 110 in 2010 to 1,100 at present," he said. 
 
 He said that the holding had been constant for over a decade as he had neither purchased nor sold a single share. 
 
 "There is another manufactured lie about Heritage Foods selling its retail business wing to Future Retail Ltd by retaining only 3.65% stake worth 295 crore in it. In reality, we have not sold away our dairy business so the growth is not linked to it," he said. Lokesh said Jagan had no moral right to criticise him while he was facing charges for amassing assets through illegal means. He said that Jagan had never declared assets and dared him for a debate. 
 
 He demanded that Jagan hand over the list of his assets to the chairman of Assembly privileges committee if he was so sincere to serve people. In a sarcastic remark against YSRC leader, Lokesh said he would not do anything that would bring disrepute to his family.
