VISAKHAPATNAM: Valentine’s Day is a threat to the Indian ethos and its cultural fabric, said   state organising secretary K Vasu who organised a protest in front of Shivaji Park with black flags against Valentine’s Day celebrations. 

 Vasu said they object to ‘indecent expressions of love’. “The indecent expression of love in public places is what we object to. Valentine’s Day culture has been hardwired into the brains of the Indian youth and it is making them think they are worthless unless they have a partner. Minors are also becoming spoilt due to this. It’s time to preserve our culture. Foreign cultures have limited love to just one day of the year but the Indian ethos makes love an integral part of our lives throughout the year - with our family,” said Vasu.
 
 The activists raised slogans against Valentine’s Day and burnt heart-shaped placards. They urged the government to ban Valentine’s Day celebrations from next year.
 
 In Hyderabad, Valentine’s Day celebrations turned ugly, on Wednesday after protesters affiliated to Bajrang Dal rampaged through a mall in Kukatpally, and stormed hotels and eateries, forcing managements to roll back   offers. Agitators burnt effigies at Abids crossroads and   to condemn the occasion, and maintained strict vigil outside parks. 
 
 At Manjeera Mall, Kukaptally, Bajrang Dal members were seen pulling down decorations and raising anti-Valentine Day slogans, forcing police to intervene. A mob also gathered at The Park Hotel, Somajiguda, later in the evening, demanding that the management shelve February 14 programmes.
