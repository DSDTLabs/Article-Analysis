They may be all set to get hitched this year, but before becoming life partners, wrestlers   and   have become teammates. Satyawart is a part of the Delhi franchise of a professional wrestling league, of which Sakshi is the captain, it turns out. When we caught up with the couple at a recent event in the capital, Satyawart spoke about the advantages of being in the same team. "We hadn’t thought that we would end up being in the same team. It happened by chance in the auction. But it’s good because now we have one teammate who understands the other one completely. Practice mein bhi help hoti hai aur moral support bhi rehta hai," he said. But will that help the romance too? “Arre uss sab ka time hi kahan hai. Right now, it’s all about training and fights. Woh sab league ke baad," Sakshi laughed. "Woh sab shaadi ke hi baad," replied Satyawart quickly.

 The two will get married on April 2 in a grand ceremony in   and the preparations are already underway in both the households. The couple, however, is far from the festivities, for now. Sakshi said, "Earlier, we had selected a date in January but with the wrestling league falling in the same month, we postponed it. The families are taking care of all the preparations for now. Hamara dhyan toh wrestling par hai iss time."
 
 Satyawart also said that he is happy to be a part of the Delhi team in the league because of his purana rishta with the city. "I was in class three when I first came to Delhi with my father to watch a dangal that used to take place in  . It was a popular competition where you had to win nine fights in a row to be called a  . Some years later, that became my first title in wrestling. So Delhi is special because this place gave me my first title," he added.
