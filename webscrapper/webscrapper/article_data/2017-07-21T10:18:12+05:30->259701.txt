SALEM: State BJP president   Soundarrajan on Wednesday urged the Tamil Nadu police to   across the state, citing rise in extremist activities. She also expressed concerns over the delay in solving murder cases of both Hindu outfit and the saffron party members. 

 Tamilisai was in the city to participate in the fourth death anniversary of former state BJP general secretary ‘Auditor’ Ramesh, who was murdered in 2013. Speaking to the media, she said, “Even four years after Ramesh’s murder, the trial in the case is yet to begin.”
 
 Pointing out that there was also no development in the murder cases of other BJP and Hindu outfit functionaries, Tamilisai alleged political conspiracy behind denying justice to the family members of the deceased.
 
 Referring to the arrest of terrorists from Tiruppur and other parts of the state, Tamilisai said “Tamil Nadu could be under terror threat”. She asked the police to ensure the safety of people. “The terrorist groups are brainwashing the student community to join their movement. This is a dangerous trend,” she added. She also warned about the increasing Naxal presence in the state.
 
 Asked why was the BJP targeting actor Kamal Hassan for his remarks on the state government, Tamilisai said if the actor wanted to criticise the government, he should enter politics instead of sharing his views on social media. “Where was Kamal Hassan until last year,” she questioned.
 
 The BJP leader, however, praised actor Rajnikanth for extending his views on all important issues, including the river linking project, for long time.
