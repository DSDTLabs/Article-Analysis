HARIDWAR: Ninety-two ‘scholar ascetics’ were given ‘diksha’ (initiation) by Yoga guru   on Ramnavami at the VIP ghat in Haridwar on Sunday. The youths from various parts of the country dressed in saffron robes and wielding sticks and kamandal sat on the banks of Ganga as they were given diksha amidst chanting of Vedic mantras.
 
  The   which include former corporate executives, doctors and engineers, are being trained by Ramdev in traditional scriptures and other disciplines and will be part of a 1000-strong core team that will handle the work currently done by Patanjali and from which the yoga guru's successor will eventually emerge.
  
  On the occasion, Ramdev said, “The scholar ascetics have resolved to live for goals Patanjali has set before itself and to propagate Indian culture and tradition.
  
   , an MBA-holder from Bijnor, said that he was inspired by Ramdev to lead a life committed to social service. Gaurang, an Assamese farmer, said he was taking sanyas to “realise the self”.
