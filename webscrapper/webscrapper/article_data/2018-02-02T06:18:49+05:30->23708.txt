MARGAO: Margao Municipal Council on Thursday cancelled Saturday’s function called to rename the area opposite the St Sebastian Church, Aquem, Margao as the ‘Chandrakant Keni’ square following local opposition to the move.

 The area is presently called ‘Pandava Copel’. A delegation of locals submitted a memorandum to   chairperson   on Thursday asking that the decision to rename the area be reconsidered.
