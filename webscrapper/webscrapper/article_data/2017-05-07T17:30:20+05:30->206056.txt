THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior Congress leader A K   said that all the opposition parties are going to unite against the BJP in the election for the new President.

 Antony while speaking at a function at the KPCC headquarters here on Sunday said that all the opposition parties are going to unite against the BJP and the discussions for this are going on. The country is going to witness a unified opposition in the election for the new president, he added.
 
 He criticised the CPM for taking a negative stand whenever the opposition parties unite to fight against the BJP. "When all the Opposition parties realised that only Congress can take on the BJP at the national level, the CPM took a difference view. The CPM leaders are forgetting that they will have to raise slogan for AICC president Sonia Gandhi one day. The CPM has faced its worst phase in West Bengal and the same plight is going to happen in Kerala also for them. The CPM will realise one day that they will have to pay a heavy price for the blind opposition being shown against the Congress in the country," said Antony.
