RAJKOT: Relatives and friends of a   in Morbi have been cheated of huge amounts after a 20-year-old from   hacked his   account and requested for money to meet medical expenses.

 Relatives of the factory owner Dipak Dhamasana kept transferring the money into the e-wallet of the fraudster identified as Dharmik Babari (20) thinking that it was the former who was requesting for money. They transferred the money into Babari’s Paytm account whose number he had posted on the social networking site. 
 
 The fraud came to light when one of Dhamasana’s friends met him few days ago and casually inquired as to why he needed the money. Dhamasana, who lives in  , was surprised and told him that he had never asked for money from anybody. When his friend then told him about the messages on his Facebook, Dhamasana realized that someone had hacked into his account. He immediately approached Morbi local crime branch and lodged a complaint.
 
 Based on the Paytm account number, the LCB sleuths traced Babari, who is the son of a cloth trader in Jamnagar and lives in Patel Colony there.
 
 R T Vyas, Morbi LCB inspector, told TOI, “After hacking into the account of Dhamasana, Babari started demanding money from his relatives citing medical emergency. Babari would request them to transfer money in his (Babari’s) Paytm account. Babari is suspected to have siphoned off more than Rs one lakh from Dhamasana’s three relatives and friends.” 
 
 “The total amount of the money that Babari has siphoned off is not clear yet, as those duped by him are yet to approach us. However, one of Dhamasana’s relatives has approached and told us that he had lost Rs 50,000. The scope of the fraud appears to be bigger as we suspect that Babari has siphoned off more than Rs one lakh,” Vyas said, adding that more details of the fraud would come to light during the interrogation of Babari. 
 
 During his interrogation, Babari said that he had committed the fraud to fund his lavish lifestyle.
