NEW DELHI: Urging those turning 18 to register themselves as electors, Prime Minister   on Sunday said their votes would prove to be the bedrock of a 'New India' and suggested that a 'mock  ' be organised in Delhi around August 15 to deliberate on how 'New India' could be formed in the next five years. 

 
 "Right now, I got an idea whether we could organise a 'mock Parliament' in every district of India where the youth between 18 and 25 could sit together and brainstorm about 'New India', find ways and chalk out plans," Modi said in his monthly radio programme " ". 
 
  He said, "Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth. Our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success. I wish the New India youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should get to know all this and benefit from it." 
 
  Recounting the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, the topper of Kashmir Administrative Service examination, Modi said, "He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination. 
 
  For a young child, such an atmosphere of violence could create darkness and bitterness, but Anjum did not let it be so. He never gave up hope."
