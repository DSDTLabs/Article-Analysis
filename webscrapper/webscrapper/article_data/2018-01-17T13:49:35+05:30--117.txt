MUMBAI: An   requesting non-vegetarians to use “only the tray-type   meant for   dishes” has raked up a controversy on the   campus. The mail also said: “Please do not use the ‘main’ plates for   dishes.”

 Every hostel has its own council and is managed by students. The mess co-ordinator of Hostel 11, housing around 300, sent the mail on Saturday. The co-ordinator, also a student, issued a clarification on Monday after the mail was “questioned” on social media. Some supported the mail stating plates for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes should be separated; many were outraged by the “segregation”.
 
 One of the comments said: “What most people seem to have a problem with is the term ‘main plates’. They say it is a ploy to make vegetarian diet the preferred one and to push right-wing Hindu agenda...” Many supported it.
 
  
 
 The mess team posted a clarification. “The practice of using separate smaller tray-type plates for non-vegetarian dishes has existed for years now. The mail was just requesting students to stick to the practice since there have been complaints from vegetarians too. The mess co-ordinator did not mean to offend anyone,” a student from the hostel committee said.
