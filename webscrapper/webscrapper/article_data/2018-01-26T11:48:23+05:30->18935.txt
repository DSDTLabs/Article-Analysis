What happens when two powerful women come together to brainstorm over how to strengthen others of their kind? A little male bashing, some anecdotes, and several suggestions on how the proverbial glass ceilings can be breached, if only to an extent, but successfully.

 Discussing how institutions built from male perspectives find it difficult to give adequate space to women, Baroness  , a leading human rights lawyer in the UK and member of the House of Lords, and former   governor   said men must be made equal partners in women’s quest for gender equality.
 
 Referring to social conditioning as one of the key reasons why men found it difficult to regard women as their equals, Alva, also a former Union minister in the   government, narrated how men would very often deny women political leaders tickets only because of their age. “I was on the party’s election committee for nearly 10 years and I saw how the men who wanted a ticket denied a woman in her 50s on account of her advanced years,” she said.
 
 “The Women’s Reservation Bill has been pending in   and, with the sheer numbers this government has, it can be passed in half a day, but they won’t,” Alva said.
