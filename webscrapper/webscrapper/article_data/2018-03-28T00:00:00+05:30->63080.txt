It was an enjoyable afternoon for the students of a private university when a   party was organised at the campus recently. The main reason of organising this rain dance party was to give a cool welcome to the summer season as well as lower the exam stress of the students. The students were seen getting drenched under the sprinklers and dancing to their favourite Bollywood hits. A few typical baarish waale numbers were also played at the party.
