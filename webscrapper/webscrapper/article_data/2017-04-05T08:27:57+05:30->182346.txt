PATIALA: In a bid to circumvent SC's order banning liquor sale along state and national highways, the Punjab government on Tuesday denotified   of seven state highways, thus making them a part of city roads. The move is in line with the centre's policy on national highways, which excludes bypass stretches from the   and brings them under city urban roads network. 

 Satish Arora, president of Hotel, Restaurant and Resorts Association Punjab (HRRAP), said the denotification of bypass roads is inadequate as it will provide relief to only a few hoteliers. He said highways passing through main cities should have been denotified. "There are still more than 80% hoteliers who face closure due to the SC rider as they have lost business," he said. Hotels and restaurants in the state have put their losses at more than Rs 200 crore in the last four days alone, government officials said that the dip over 65% of their earnings Â­ had affected state's revenue collections too.
 
 HRRAP members say there are more than 2,700 bars, hotels and restaurants in the state, out of which around 2,000 have been hit by the   along highways. These establishments claim to have collective sales of between Rs 48 crore and Rs 50 crore daily out of which a considerable share goes to the state coffers as taxes.
 
 These hotels and bars also chip in Rs 100 crore against licensing fees and pay an additional assessment cess of Rs 3,000 on each liquor carton bought and served by them.
 
 APS Chattha, CEO of the HRRAP, said more than 80 % of the hotel industry in Punjab, which was surviving on liquor sales, faced closure if the rules were not changed. He claimed that more than seven lakh families were affected.
