CHANDIGARH: Removal of Colony number 5 from land that belongs to the Chandigarh administration has not offered relief to residents of sectors 50 and 51 as the vacant land has become a haven for anti-social elements who come here at night to drink.

 Wire fencing has been put up around the vacant land but it is damaged at some place by those trying to get inside.
 
 
 Repeated complaints to authorities concerned have not led to remedial action. S S Bhardwaj, president, Citizensâ€™ Welfare Society ( ) said from the beginning they had been asking the administration to proceed with a plan for this centrally located area.
 
 Sangeeta Lekhi, general secretary, New Light Society, Chandigarh pointed out that the land, which is being used by people to consume alcohol, has also become prone to crime and remedial action is urgently needed.
 
 She said even though authorities have installed wire fencing, it is not much of a deterrant, especially as there are no checks by the police. She said society members clear the weeds for the safety of women residents but anti-social elements keep changing their spot to have liquor.
 
 Urmali Kumari, a resident of Sector 51 said for the past one year, since the road was constructed, residents have been demanding installation of streetlights in the area but nothing has been done so far. She urged residents to act swiftly in view of safety of residents and said criminals could easily take advantage of the darkness and isolation in the area.
 
 Heera Negi, councillor, Sector 51 said she has taken up the issue with officials concerned, who visited the area. She said they assured a plan to resolve issues and commence pending projects, which would make things better. Recently, she said, officials visited the area for inspection.
