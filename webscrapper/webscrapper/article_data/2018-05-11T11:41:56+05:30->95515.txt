QUEPEM: Hours after being confronted by opposition councillors, Cuncolim municipal council ( ), chairperson,  , on Wednesday revoked the no objection certificated ( ) granted for the setting up of a fish meal processing plant at the Cuncolim industrial estate hours.

 Former CMC chairperson   and local activist   have, however, termed this revocation as yet another illegality, alleging the CMC is “taking decisions as if the council is their personal property”.
 
 “I have revoked the earlier NOC without convening a council meeting since the was also NOC issued by me without a council meeting” she said.
 
 Sources said that when Carneiro contacted the director of municipal administration (DMA) office about the NOC issue, she was told to revoke it as it had been wrongly issued without following proper legal procedure.
 
 “We won’t tolerate any more illegalities and we won’t allow polluting industries in Cuncolim. The industrial estate already has polluting industries due to which locals are suffering from foul smell” Almeida alleged.
