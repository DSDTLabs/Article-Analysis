CHENNAI: For about a fortnight now,  , the suspended DSP, has managed to evade arrest. 

 Wanted in connection with the sale of ancient   worth crores of rupees, the DSP went underground soon after his accomplice, a sub-inspector of police, was picked up for questioning.
 
 He may be preparing to obtain anticipatory bail from a court, say sources. 
 
 A team of CID’s idol wing officials initially said the suspended officer had gone on medical leave. Later, they clarified he was on the run. He was placed under suspension based on an order from Madras high court justice R Mahadevan on June 29. 
 
 On June 27, the court came down hard on the CID, a police team arrested sub inspector Subburaj, 54, serving in the idol wing. Batcha is said to have obtained the idols from a farmer and sold them for Rs 2 crore to another smuggler, Deenadayalan, a close associate of the international idol smuggler Subhash Kapoor.
 
 A case has been filed under IPC charges for alleged offences including robbery, or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous injury. 
 
 As the Batcha had served as inspector in Trichy zone, police strongly suspect that he is hiding at one of his friend’s houses there. Batcha had been placed under suspension earlier for accepting bribe in Trichy.
