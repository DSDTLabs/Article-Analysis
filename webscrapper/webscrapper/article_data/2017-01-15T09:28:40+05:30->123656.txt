NAGPUR: An alumni of city’s   and now settled in Milwaukee,  , a gastroenterologist at   and the   of Wisconsin, has given a unique gift to the world. It has given a new direction to regenerative medicine and treatment of oesophagal cancers. 

 Talking about his experience of regenerating a completely infected and destroyed oesophagus (part of digestive system from mouth to stomach) into a new one inside a 24-year-old accident victim, Dr Dua said that he would now be working to replicate the experiment in animals and then conduct trials in human beings to make the procedure a scientifically accepted technique.
 
 “Though we could successfully regenerate the oesophagus in the young boy, we would like to now establish it as a technique for treatment of oesophagal defects and diseases like cancer for which we will have to work first in animals,” said Dr Dua. 
 
 The work published in well-known medical journal   in April 2016 has been widely accepted by doctors across the globe. The patient couldn’t swallow or eat anything as the oesophagus was so badly infected that the food would fall into the chest. 
 
 Dr Dua put three stents of 5cm one after other in an overlapping fashion, wrapped it with donated human skin and sprayed it with concentrated platelets of the patient himself, all this an endoscopic procedure. Eight years after the operation, the patient is living a normal life and eating food normally.
