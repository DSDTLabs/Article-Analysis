INDORE: The   on Wednesday gave a conditional nod for the   between Malhar and C21 mall. A proposal for construction of two skywalks was sent by the town and country planning department recently.

 The skywalks between the two malls would be developed on the second and third floor.
 
 With the IDAâ€™s conditional nod for   (NOC), for development of skywalks, commuting between the two malls would be much easier in the days to come.
 
 "We were approached for an NOC for the proposal by town and country planning department. After studying the plans in the board meeting, the decision was taken," said IDA chairman  .
 
 Presently, the vehicular traffic and on-walk commuters make it difficult to move between two malls. With the development of these two skywalks, movement would be at ease as only vehicular traffic will be on road. The proposal seeks to reduce the rush on roads between the two malls.
 
 "At present, people have to use the roads to get from one mall to the other. They have to come down from whichever floor they are on. Moreover, this creates a lot of chaos on the road. This would also reduce queues at entrances to the malls," Lalwani said.
 
 He added with these malls becoming prominent shopping destination in the city, traffic problems have become a major issue. Most people cross the road obstructing traffic from both sides, creating traffic jams on the main road. A number of incidents of brawl and minor accidents were also reported at the site.
