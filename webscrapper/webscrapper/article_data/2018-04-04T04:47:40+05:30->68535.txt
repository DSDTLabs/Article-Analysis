MUMBAI: An 18-year-old youth who had barged into the ladies compartment of a   line local at Kurla station on Monday and  , Akanksha Tripathi, was nabbed within 24 hours by the RPF. 

 The accused,  , used to specifically target women commuters. Police said two of his siblings are also criminals. In fact last year too, a woman doctor travelling in a train ended up becoming his target.
 
  "Gawli is a habitual offender. We had detained him even as a minor for robberies. In 2016, he had slashed one of our personnel with a razor blade in a bid to flee," said senior inspector S Atri, Kurla RPF. 
 
 After Dr Tripathi registered a police complaint on Monday, the RPF went through   footage of the station. Though Gawli's face was not captured on camera, the RPF personnel identified him from his gait.
 
  On March 29, Gawli had targeted another woman commuter. "We have recovered her phone as well as Dr Tripathi's, besides a third stolen phone. A man named   who bought the stolen phones from Gawli has also been arrested," said Atri. 
 
  Dr Tripathi had been standing in the passage of the train around 2.12 pm when Gawli entered the second-class ladies coach. When she asked him why he had got in, he didn't reply, but went over to the other door. As the train started moving, he snatched her phone and jumped on to the tracks. When Dr Tripathi went to Wadala GRP outpost to complain, she discovered six others had been similarly targeted and their phones stolen on the Kurla harbour section within four hours that day.
