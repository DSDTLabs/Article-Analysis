CHENNAI: In an indirect restraint on circulation of the contents of retired IAS officer   committee report on the   issue, the Madras high court said the report should be kept in a sealed cover till further orders.

 
 “Since an apprehension has been expressed that the report of the committee is likely to be submitted before the present petition could be heard finally, and in which event the criminal investigation by CB-CID may likely be diluted, this court is of the considered view that if any report is submitted by the committee before the next date of hearing the same shall be kept in a sealed cover and await further orders from this court,” a vacation bench of Justices V Parthiban and P D Audikesavalu saidon Thursday.
 
 The Revolutionary Youth and Students Federation had moved the court stating that if the Santhanam committee appointed by the governor was allowed to file its report on the   sex scandal, it might dilute the criminal investigation carried out by the CB-CID.
 
 The federation sought to restrain the committee from filing its report till the   concludes its probe.
 
 As the government pleader opposed the PIL saying that the Madurai bench had dismissed a similar PIL, the bench directed the pleader to produce a copy of the dismissal order before the next hearing.
