KOLKATA: Congress high command is toying with the idea of fielding IPL chairman and Congressman Rajiv Shukla for the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from West  , making it all too apparent that it is eyeing Mamata Banerjee’s support to make the candidate sail through.

 Things are yet to take shape as Congress doesn’t have the adequate numbers to get its candidate elected on its own. It has to depend on Trinamool Congress when Mamata has already announced that the party would field candidates for all the five Rajya Sabha seats from Bengal. In the event of a sixth candidate, Trinamool has to forego one, like Mamata did last time by throwing her weight behind  .
 
 The Congress high command seized the opportunity after the   left it to the high command to take a call on this issue. Even as   leaders Adhir Chowdhury and Abdul Mannan were planning to field an independent candidate for the fifth seat with Left support, the plan hasn’t materialised yet. CPM leaders are known to have suggested four to five names that have to be considered by the AICC. Mannan finds it difficult to get formal stamp for one of these names from the AICC unless the CPM leaders in Delhi take up the matter with Congress leaders in Delhi.
 
 With such a possibility seems to be unlikely before the CPM party Congress, the Bengal Congress has to go by the selection of Congress high command. Meira Kumar’s name is also doing the rounds in Congress circles though it all depends on the Trinamool decision and it choice.
