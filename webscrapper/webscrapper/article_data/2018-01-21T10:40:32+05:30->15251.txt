PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: After deputy mayor   lodged a complaint, a survey of houses located in   as well as adjacent areas is being conducted in order to document and resolve problems related to water supply.

 Explaining the issues related to water supply in her ward spread across Akurdi, Nigdi, Transportnagari and other areas, More said, “There are complaints of inadequate water supply in many areas. There were also complaints of contaminated water supply from some areas and so I held a meeting with the civic water supply department last week. I have directed them to take remedial measures and provide adequate water.”
 
 According to More, officials of the   (PCMC) have complained that some residents use water for gardening and washing vehicles on a large scale causing water shortage. “They have also complained that some residents use motor pumps to draw water directly from the pipelines. I have directed the officials to seize such pumps.”
 
 Vishal Kamble, executive engineer of zone A and F of the water supply department, said, “The civic body can give water supply with pressure only up to a height of 3 feet above ground level through its pipelines. Most single-storied houses and some double-storied buildings do not have underground tanks. They must construct or store water in ground-level tanks, then pump it on their own to overhead tanks for distribution in their buildings.”
