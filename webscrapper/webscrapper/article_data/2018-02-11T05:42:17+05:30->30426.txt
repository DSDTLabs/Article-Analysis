JALPAIGURI: The   (NFR) has installed gadgets in places along the tracks in Rangia and Alipurduar divisions that will emit sound of buzzing honeybees to keep jumbos away from the lines in an effort to curb   deaths.

 Since the sound of buzzing honeybees irritates elephants, officials are hopeful that on hearing the sound the pachyderms will avoid coming near the tracks. The gadget, a source said, is a pedal used by musicians to alter the sound of amplified electric musical instruments.
 
 The acting GM of NFR, Lokesh Narayan claimed on Saturday that in Rangia division it was a success. “Steps are being taken to minimise such accidents. We have asked our divisions to install the gadgets,” Narayan said. 
 
 The acting GM of NFR had come to   to check the progress of work of line doubling and check the strength of the Y channel connecting   with   via Mathabhanga.
 
 In Alipurduar division, it has so far been installed at two places — SK 171 and SK 126 (a railway crossing between Nagrakata and Chalsa near the Chapramari WL Sanctuary and another one in Kalchini in BTR). “There has been only one elephant death since 2015 and that too because that day the visibility was too poor due to heavy fog. We are working on the issue constantly,” said CV Raman, DRM, Alipurduar.
 
 Environmentalists, however, are not quite impressed with the railways. According to state wildlife advisory board member Animesh Bose, the only way to curb such accidents is to avoid train movement along the Dooars route at night.
