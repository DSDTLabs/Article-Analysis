BENGALURU: Traffic police are all out preparing for the upcoming monsoon. Having identified 128 locations in the city which are vulnerable to waterlogging, they have asked   and BWSSB to do all that is needed to resolve the problem before the onset of rain.

 Traffic police are the first to feel the heat of excessive rain in Bengaluru, as any downpour, especially during morning and evening peak hours, causes massive jams. Even vehicles like   buses getting submerged with passengers on board are common at some spots.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (traffic)   told TOI that they have massive plans to tackle rain, particularly in the central business district (CBD). “Roads and junctions outside the CBD area are better compared to those within. Any rain in evening or late evening will cause huge traffic jams and bottlenecks. We have asked officials from BBMP and BWSSB to address all the issues in their jurisdiction,“ he said, adding, “We identified the spots based on research done on problems faced during the last few rainy seasons.“
 
 The 128 points have been identified in the jurisdiction of 36 traffic police stations.While areas like High Grounds, Wilson Garden,  , Malleswaram and Jayanagar have over four vulnerable spots each, RT Nagar, Upparpet, Chickpet, Vijayanagar, Kamakshi palya and Kengeri have less than three each.
 
 Further, police said officials from BBMP, BWSSB and BMTC will be asked to join traffic police personnel at the   (TMC), Shivajinagar, during heavy-rain days to watch live feed of how the chaos unfolds. The video wall at TMC receives feed from about 180 CCTV cam eras installed at busy intersections, mostly in the CBD.
 
 “All stakeholders of the city will sit under one roof and this will help us address the problem within the shortest possible time.BBMP officials can coordinate with BWSSB and traffic personnel during incidents like tree fall and electrical poles crashing,“ Hitendra explained.
