CHENNAI: The ideal end for   to a phenomenal home season would have been a successful  , but that was not to be. The sports hernia that could have kept him out of the Australia series, finally forced him to sit out the IPL.

 "Ashwin knew that he had to take rest at some point. He could have chosen to sit out the Australian series, but he chose to play through pain," a source close to the champion offie, told TOI. That was the reason why, at times, the offie, who finished the season with 82 wickets from 13 Tests, looked tired as India went on to beat Australia 2-1.
 
 But the source clarified that it wasn't Ashwin's decision to sit out of the IPL.
 
 "He was assessed by the BCCI medical committee. Ashwin didn't go and tell them that he didn't want to play the IPL, it was entirely the call of the BCCI doctors that he should get the necessary rest," the source added. In fact, the fact that he would be unavailable for the IPL, was communicated to the offie only on Thursday night. "It's obviously disappointing for him, but Ashwin chose country over club," the source said.
 
 Ashwin had worked extremely hard right through the home season. Even during small breaks in between Test matches, he was at his academy ground in Chennai working on his game. It has taken a toll on his body and now, finally, the offspinner will take a complete break.
