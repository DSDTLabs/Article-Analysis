CHENNAI: Stressing the importance of lifelong learning, former chairman of   Nandan   advised   graduates that their biggest takeaway must be the ability of ‘learning to learn’ new things as they prepare for changes ahead.

 “Never has the pace of change been as high as today. We are entering an era of lifelong learning because we can’t predict the kind of jobs or organisations we will be working for. You have to learn something new every few years,” he said while speaking at the 54th IIT-M convocation on Friday.
 
 Nilekani said, “Many jobs that exist today may not be there tomorrow while many which don’t exist today will be created later. Whether careers or job markets, the key message is life-long learning,” he said, adding learning need not necessarily be on campus but could be online, anytime, anywhere.
 
 Nilekani said while machines will take away jobs that machines can do well, it could never take away jobs that require people to do well. “Soft skills, empathy, collaboration, teamwork, goal setting and leading people can never be automated. So you should develop capability in doing things in a different way that have a high degree of human interaction,” he said. 
 
 Stating that India is on the verge of enormous change due to digital explosion, Nilekani said data has become the new oil of the 21st century and the the basis of transformation. He said it is important for data to be democratised and accessible to everyone and must be restructured to benefit individuals and businesses. With large scale national networks like GST, he said a consumer can get his own data to get better loan, education or healthcare, while a business can use data to get better credit or business.
 
 IIT-M director professor   said a total of 2,263 degrees were awarded this year. With 257 PhDs awarded this year, IIT officials said this has been the highest number in the history of the institute so far.
