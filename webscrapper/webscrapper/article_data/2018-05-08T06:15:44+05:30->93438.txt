LUCKNOW: The three-year-old boy who went missing from a wedding in   area and was found dead next morning had been killed by a relative who wanted to marry his mother.

 Police arrested the accused, identified as   of Thakurganj, on Monday after he confessed that he had killed three-yearold   on April 27.
 
 On April 28, Rishabh’s body was found in a field of Garhi village in Thakurganj police station area. Rishabh had come to attend a marriage at his maternal grandmother’s house along with his mother Khushboo. Rajjan told police that he developed a liking for   much before he married her sister. When Khushboo got married in 2013, he started playing tricks to separate her from her husband but could not succeed.
 
 Khushboo’s relations with her husband soured later on. When the accused came to know this, he purchased a SIM on a fake identity and called up Khushboo’s husband to increase differences between them by telling him that Khushboo was a woman of bad character and that she had physical relations with several men. Rajjan had also been invited to the wedding in the family. When he found Rishabh all alone outside the wedding venue, he lured him away and killed him by throttling his neck.
 
 ASP (west) Vikas Tripathi said that   killed the boy thinking that Khushboo would suspect that her husband had killed Rishabh and that on her complaint her husband would be sent to jail. Rajjan thought that he would then be able to marry Khushboo, said police.
 
 ASP Tripathi said that when police scanned and cross-checked call detail records of the family during probe, it found that a call had been made from an unknown number to Khushboo’s husband and shortly after to Khushboo. Cops found that Rajjan was using the number. When cops interrogated Rajjan, he broke down and confessed his crime.
