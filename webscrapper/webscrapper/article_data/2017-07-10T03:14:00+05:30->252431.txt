Nagpur: The written test for junior assistant conducted by Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) on Sunday courted controversy when the exam centre, Jhulelal Institute Technology (JIT) at Lonare on Koradi Road, failed make proper seating arrangement besides complaints of paper leak. Chaos reigned supreme as over 1,000 students boycotted the exam and came out of the halls at JIT.  Later, the MSRTC decided to hold re-exam for only this centre while aspirants demanded it be held for the entire state. In the evening, the aspirants, backed by National Students Union of India (NSUI), also staged a protest at Samvidhan Square.  The aggrieved aspirants told TOI that when they entered the exam halls they found no roll numbers were written on their seats. “The invigilator came and told us to occupy any seat. When he started distributing the papers, we noticed the seal was missing from the envelope. So, some of the aspirants walked out and demanded action. Soon all aspirants joined them,” they said. MSRTC divisional controller Sudhir Panchbhai denied any paper leak. He said, the private agency RC Infotech, which was roped in to conduct the exam, had booked 21 classrooms. The mess happened as invigilators of two classrooms did not turn up on time even as papers were distributed to all other students. Panchbhai said, this irked the other students who did not get the papers. They staged a walkout and also forced others to follow suit. “There was no requisite police protection to handle the situation, though police reached the spot following complaints,” he added. By the time the situation was brought under control, the paper went viral on social media. In other three centres in the city, the exam passed of peacefully. “Now, MSRTC will conduct fresh exam for these 12,00 students at MSRTC destination. Applicants will be informed about it,” said Panchbhai.
