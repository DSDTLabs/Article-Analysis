HYDERABAD:   will send three   members in the elections that have been scheduled for March 23. The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday announced the schedule to fill the seats of members retiring in April-May 2018. 

 According to ECI, a total of 58 members of the Rajya Sabha from 16 states will retire and vacancies arising out of this should be filled. The incumbent   (TRS) will easily be able to get its three nominees elected considering the strength it has for the polling. CM K   has already begun an exercise on the nominations. 
 
 One name that has been doing the rounds is that of TRS general secretary Joginapally Santhosh Kumar. He is a close relative of KCR and was appointed for the party post in October 2017. It may be mentioned here that former minister Uma Madhava Reddy is also in the fray to get a nomination. Madhava Reddy had joined the TRS from   in December 2017. At the time of joining TRS she had requested for the nomination. 
 
 KCR has not spelt out his mind on the nominations, and is expected to do a 'balancing act' by taking caste equations and 2019 polls into consideration.
