 Body shaming has become a trend on social media. From actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sonakshi Sinha to  , all have been targeted for weight issues, skin tone or other features. The celebs of Bengali television industry are no exception.
 
 
 Television actress  , who is playing the role of ‘Parameshwari’ in popular serial ‘Andarmahal’ said, “Whenever I lose weight people say you are looking pale. When I gain it, they criticise. People are never satisfied. They would criticize whatever you do. It’s funny!” 
 
 
 She further elaborates, “I have never paid attention to what people are saying. But the problem is we are not happy with our bodies too. We all wish for perfection.”
 
 
 Actress Aparajita Auddy had a spot on answer for these self-acclaimed critics. She said, “Haters will always hate. Now social media has made their job very easy. They don’t have other jobs so they troll others. I don’t get affected by that. In fact, no one should.”
 
 
 The veteran actress who has done very popular shows like ‘Sanyasi Raja’, ‘Punyi Pukur’ and ‘Jol Nupur’ though admitted that it is good to have a fit body. She said, “Yes you need to be fit so that you can live healthily. If you are slim then you will look good in camera. But if that was the only criteria then we could not have finest actors like   or Irrfan Khan.”
 
 
 Actress Aninditaa Bose posted photos of young age on Instagram on women’s day. Without inhibition, she thanked her younger version for who she is today.
