NAGPUR:   got off to a brilliant start in the   tournament at Calagry, Alberta, on Wednesday.
The tall city shuttler Sarang overcame a mid-match slump to defeat Eugene Chan of Canada 21-9, 17-21, 21-7 in the menâ€™s singles first round match, which lasted for 40 minutes.
 
 The world No. 198 looked in fine touch from the beginning and wrapped up the first game quite easily at 21-9. Sarang was also in control of the proceedings in the next game but the local lad came up with spirited display towards the end to win it narrowly and levelled the games scores 1-1.
 
 However, the 24-year-old Indian was in his elements once again in the decider and clinched the game and match with a wonderful attacking exhibition of strokes.
 
 The unseeded Indian will have a big task ahead as he is clashing with top seed Lee Hyun Il of Korea in the second round. The world No. 12 Korean had beaten Hashiru Shimono of Japan 21-9, 21-11 in the first round.
 
 Second seed HS Prannoy made short work of unseeded Job Castillo of Mexico 21-13, 21-15 while Kashyap trounced Daniel La Torre Regal of Peru in straight games 21-11, 21-9.
 
 Budding shuttler   joined the seniors in the second round. Abhishek drubbed Hoang Nam Nguyen of Vietnam 21-15, 21-15. Harsheel Dani, who lost to 11th seed Lucas Corvee of France 11-21, 7-21, was the only Indian casualty on the first day.
