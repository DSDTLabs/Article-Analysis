IMPHAL: Titular king of the state Leishemba Sanajaoba met leaders of the agitating United Naga Council ( ) in Senapati district and urged them to end the ongoing economic blockade on National Highways. 

 Leishemba visited the Naga-dominated district along with leaders of various civil bodies and held a brief discussion with UNC leaders, including general secretary S Milan and former president of the council.
 
 Leishemba urged the Naga civil apex body to look for other democratic options and lift the blockade in view of the public suffering. Acknowledging the titular king's insistence and the public woes, Milan said the public only accused the UNC for imposing the blockade without studying the cause and origin of the agitation.
 
 Stating that chief minister   triggered the blockade call, the UNC said he should also know how to end it. Former UNC presidents said accusing UNC and deploying security forces to break the blockade will not resolve the problem. They said there are many good people among the Nagas and the Meiteis, and they are happy about the titular king's arrival to discuss the issue.
 
 On the other hand, a large number of people staged a sit-in protest at Khwairamband market in   city to denounce the blockade that entered its 82nd day on Sunday.
 
 The demonstrators, including leaders of various civil bodies among whom Ph Deban Sharma, president of the All Manipur United Clubs' Organization figured, categorically blamed both the Centre and state governments for failing to lift the blockade and, instead, accusing each other.
