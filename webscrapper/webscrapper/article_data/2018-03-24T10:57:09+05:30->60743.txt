DABOLIM: The   is preparing to introduce an automated tray and retrieval system ( ) that will reduce passenger wait time for security check-ups. Airport director   said that the new system will be started as a pilot project within a year.

 The Dabolim airport will be one of the few airports in the country to have the new system. “It will not only lessen time taken for security checks, but there will be no need to deploy personnel from the central industrial security force (CISF) and their service can be used elsewhere at the airport, which will avoid wastage of man power,” Negi said. 
 
 With the new system, a person manning the scanner is not required to sit at security check, looking at the screen to detect suspicious baggage. “Any suspicious baggagewill be automatically moved to a different, reject tray and the passenger will be called to examine the baggage,” Negi said. 
  
 
 The x-ray machine comes with a dual camera, with more clarity in the images of the baggage being screened, making the new system technically superior. Since the system is RFID-enabled, it will speed up the screening process. The Airport authority of India (AAI), is spending Rs150 crore on the system. Negi said some of the international airports are equipped with ATRS system.
 
 Negi also said that various modifications are underway at the Dabolim airport. All the washrooms are being redesigned, while one has already been completed. “We expect the entire work to be completed in six months” he said.
 
 Besides, modifications at the multi-level car parking as directed by director general of civil aviation (DGCA) are also being carried out. “The works will be completed by July 2018,” he said, which is expercet to ease parking woes at the airport to a great extent.
