VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government’s promise to make Andhra Pradesh a cashless state seems to have hit a road block in the three north coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam with people once again going back to cash transactions.

 During the demonetisation drive in November last year, the state government had urged all the banks and the public to adopt digital wallets, debit and credit cards as well as net banking system among others to buy and sell goods and services.
 
 But when TOI enquired about the progress of digital payments in the region on Thursday, official sources said only around 25-30 per cent of transactions were being made through digital platforms. The officials attributed it to various reasons including increase in flow of cash as well as user charges imposed by merchants.
 
 “Cashless transactions had increased from 10 per cent to 30 per cent after the demonetisation drive was announced and I hope it will cross 60 per cent in the next one year if restrictions on cash transactions are imposed,” B  , Visakhapatnam district lead bank manager, said, adding that cashless transactions may increase this salary week due to cash shortages in banks and ATMs.
 
 In December last year, chief minister N   had instructed all district collectors to transform at least one village in a mandal into a cashless village on priority basis by the end of this fiscal. Srikakulam became the first district to implement the orders and the CM appreciated the concerned officials.
 
 However, Srikakulam collector   told TOI that old habits die hard. He admitted that they wanted to make 38 villages out of 38 mandals cashless, but as on date only three or four villages are using cashless transaction methods. “I will hold a meeting with the bankers at my office on Friday to review the progress of cashless transactions,” Narasimham adde
