PATNA: Bihar deputy CM   on Wednesday taunted PM   for extending greetings to the people of the state on ‘Bihar Diwas’ while sitting on their demand for special state status.

 “Bihar gave you 31 MPs. You should have kept your promise and granted the special status to it on this special occasion of  . Sir, three years have elapsed,” Tejashwi tweeted to the PM in response to the latter’s tweet, greeting the residents of Bihar on the 105th Bihar foundation day.
 
 Bihar was carved out of Bengal on March 22, 1912.
 
 The deputy CM warned that the people of Bihar would eliminate the BJP from the state in coming elections if the PM’s pre-poll promises were not fulfilled. “On ‘Bihar Diwas’, we demand ‘Special Status’ as promised by PM otherwise Biharis will completely root out BJP in upcoming elections,” read Tejashwi’s another tweet.
 
 While addressing public meetings at Bikram, Ara and Jehanabad in August 2014, BJP’s then PM candidate Modi had promised Bihar a special package if NDA came to power at the Centre. But Modi never talked of granting special state status to Bihar. However, the ruling grand alliance leaders have time and again accused the PM of not fulfilling his promise of granting the special status to Bihar.
 
 While responding to the greetings from West Bengal CM  , Tejashwi appealed for unity to fight the present- day “rightist Englishmen”.
 
 “Till 1912, Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand were a single state. Now, we will have to politically unite to fight the present-day ‘Dakshinpanthi Angrejon’,” tweeted Tejashwi, who is the son of RJD president Lalu Prasad.
