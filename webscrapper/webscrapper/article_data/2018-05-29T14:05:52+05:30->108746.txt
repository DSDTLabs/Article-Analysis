SURAT: Dhyey Shah (16) is on wheelchair since the age of five due to duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, this disability has not been able to stop him from scoring 98.63 percentile in the class X examination, results of which were announced by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) on Monday.

 
 Shah was eligible to get a writer, but he chose to give the examination on his own and scored 88 per cent marks. He underwent two surgeries at the start of the academic year and hence could not appear in the internal examination. 
 
 Dhyey, a student of Experimental School, could not attend classes regularly, but studied hard at home with the help of a tutor. “I could have scored more marks if I could write like a normal person. But I am confident now and have started preparing to study for chartered accountancy course after my class XII,” Dhyey said.
 
 Dhyey’s father Pranav, a tax consultant, and mother  , a housewife, try to support their son in his studies. “He cannot lift even his hand, but he prepared well and refused to take help of a writer for the board examination. He had to face many other problems too, yet he scored good marks,”   said.
 
 “Dhyey was able to walk until five years of age, but since then he is on wheelchair. He told us that he could have scored more marks if he only he was able to write with speed like other students,” Neeta said.
 
 “Dhyey is an inspiration for all of us, especially to students like him. He had to undergo two surgeries at the start of the year, but he continued to work hard and succe0eded in scoring 88 per cent marks,” Dhyey’s class teacher   said.
