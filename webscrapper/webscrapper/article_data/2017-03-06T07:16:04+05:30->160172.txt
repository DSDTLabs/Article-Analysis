SHAHJAHANPUR: UP inspector general of police (rules and manuals)   on Sunday alleged that the state police was deliberately not arresting accused minister Gayatri Prasad   due to political pressure. Thakur had a series of run-ins with Prajapati earlier and was suspended by the state before being reinstated on court orders.

 “State police is deliberately not arresting Prajapati because of political pressure. If a different party forms the government then police will definitely show its true power,” Thakur said at a press conference in Shahjahanpur.
 
 His wife, advocate Nutan Thakur had approached the HC to get an FIR registered against Prajapati in a rape case by a 35-yearold woman but the appeal was declined. Later the survivor approached the   to get the FIR registered. Thakur alleged that Prajapati had threatened him.
 
 Nutan had earlier lodged an FIR against Prajapati, State Women’s Commission chairperson Zarina Usmani and six others, accusing them of “framing” her husband and herself in false cases. The FIR was registered in July 2015 but the investigation is pending.
 
 “I have four departmental inquiries against me and a dozen show-cause notices because I tried to work against the mafias,” Thakur told TOI.
 
 “The fate of Prajapati’s case will depend upon the results of March 11. Police is working under immense political pressure and this is why even I failed to file an FIR in a leaked examination paper case. I had to approach the court to get the FIR registered for two cases. Police probe in those FIRs is still pending,” Thakur added.
 
 Nutan said, “Police have only attempted to save themselves from the stick of SC as they have to submit a report after 15 days. The victim is still receiving threats. A minister with Y-category security can’t suddenly go underground because cops were always around him.”
