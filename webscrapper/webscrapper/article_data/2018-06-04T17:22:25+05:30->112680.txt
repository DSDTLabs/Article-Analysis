When asked whether he would come to blows with the shark, Statham joked, "Fisticuffs with the  ? I can't tell you that. I'm not saying it doesn't happen."

 "The money is different, obviously, but things are structured in ways that are more similar than you might think. But more like Guy, all Jon does is crack jokes and trivialise his ability.
