“I will not litter, nor allow anybody to do so.”

 “I will devote 100 hours every year, that is two hours per day, to make the pledge of cleanliness come true.”
 
 “I will propagate the message Swachch Bharat Mission in every nook and corner of the country.”
 
 LUCKNOW: This was part of the pledge that new chief minister   made his team of officers take to implement the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as he met them for the first time on his first day in office.
 
 At his first   at the Lok Bhawan, the CM gave the bureaucrats a pep talk and issued them the   – poll manifesto – instructing them to adhere to it.
 
 The CM invoked Mahatama Gandhi and requested bureaucrats -- including chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar, principal secretaries and secretaries of key departments -- to stand up and repeat the one-page pledge along with him.
 
 “Mahatma Gandhi had not only dreamt India’s political independence, but had also conjured the image of a developed and clean nation,” the pledge started. While Yogi read out a line, the officers repeated in unison, till it was over. The pledge talked about the responsibilities of officers in getting the Clean India campaign implemented. “This was for the first time that we were asked to take pledge to work,” said an IAS officer on the condition of anonymity.
