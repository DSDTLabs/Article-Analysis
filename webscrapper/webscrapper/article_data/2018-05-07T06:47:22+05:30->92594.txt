COLVA: On May 8, the   in   completes 450 years. The church holds special historical significance as it was once considered to be the mother church and catered to the pastoral and spiritual needs of remote villages in South Goa. 

 Built on May 8, 1568, it was the fifth to be constructed by the Jesuits. It is believed that Jesuit missionaries entered Orlim village in the sixteenth century.
 
 Originally, the church had mud walls and a thatched roof, but, in 1590, it got a Romanesque makeover. Building material used comprised laterite stone and plaster of lime. The construction cost was borne by the gaunkars, who are the original settlers of Orlim.
 
 On the day when the first Mass was offered, 500 parishioners were administered baptism.
 
 The church was subjected to the ire of conquerors on several occasions. Muslim invaders burned down the church twice, first during the invasion of 1571 and later in 1579. It was burned down a third time in 1582, by non-Christian natives.
 
 The church’s fourth centennial anniversary celebration was held on May 8, 1968, by then parish priest late Fr Paulino Lopes. He even travelled abroad to collect funds. On the occasion, a new bell was installed in the belfry. Auxiliary bishop   had concelebrated the Mass.
 
 In 1995, then parish priest late Fr   took it on him to celebrate the 425th anniversary, even though it was two years after the actual date.
 
 Plans to mark 450 years of the Orlim church’s existence were set in motion in 2016 by former parish priest  . For the purpose he spurred various church groups and parishioner to organise funds for the celebration. However, in mid-2017, he was transferred and Fr Roger Godinho took over as the new parish priest. Under his guidance, various committees were set-up, which have worked in unison to ensure that the occasion is marked in a grand manner.
