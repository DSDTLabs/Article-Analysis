Chandigarh: National   Kamal Soi on Wednesday requested the Punjab government to recover from a private company the exorbitant fee it had charged from public for issuance of smart card-based driving licences and vehicle registration certificates.

 Addressing mediapersons at the Chandigarh Press Club here, Soi said though the private companyâ€™s extended contract has now been terminated by the state government, the authorities need to recover the amount wrongly charged by the company. Soi said an agreement was signed between the private company and the Punjab government in September 2011 for introducing e-governance in transport offices and for the issuance of smart card-based driving licenses and motor vehicle registration certificates. He said the contract was initially for a tenure of five years.
 
 He alleged that under the contract the private company charged an abnormally high price of Rs 65 for a driving licence and Rs 136.50 for a vehicle registration certificate. The National Informatics Centre Services Inc. (NICSI), a central government company, charges only Rs 45 for both driving licence and vehicle registration certificate in various states.
 
 Subsequently, in June 2015, the transport department extended the contract by five years from the date of its expiry in September 2016. The extension was granted despite the fact that the CAG in its report of 2015 had clearly recorded the exploitation and misappropriation of funds in the implementation of the project.
