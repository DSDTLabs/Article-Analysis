Actor   has said that it was exhausting for him to work in the   suit. 

  
  
 In an interview, the 44-year-old actor shared what it was like for him 'to be in the suit', "We'll have to modify the suit to make it a little bit easier to put on and take off." 
 
 The 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' star, who is also the director of the untitled 'Batman' reboot, said that finding a suit which was more comfortable was a key challenge to get the role of Dark Knight right. 
 
 "When you are in it, you can be sweating, crazy and exhausted, do your part and walk away. But when you're a director, you can't walk away. You have to be there for everybody," added Affleck.
