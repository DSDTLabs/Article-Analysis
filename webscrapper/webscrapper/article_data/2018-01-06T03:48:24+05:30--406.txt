HYDERABAD: City-based Islamic seminary,  , has stirred up a controversy by issuing a decree (fatwa) that consumption of prawn is not permissible for  . The fatwa was issued on January 1 by  , the chief mufti of the 142-year-old Islamic deemed university. 

 Many Muslim religious scholars have, however, differred with the Jamia’s ruling. 
 
 According to the fatwa, prawn is an arthropod (to which insects also belong) and it does not fall under the category of fish. The chief mufti labelled prawn under the category ‘makruh tahrim’ (strictly abominable) and advised Muslims against eating it. In Islamic jurisprudence there are three categories of food — lawful (halal), haram (prohibited) and makruh (abominable). 
 
 Foods falling under makruh are sub-divided into makruh (abominable but can be eaten) and makruh tahrim (strictly abominable and thus should be avoided).   Nizamia is a distinguished Islamic educational institution revered in several countries.
