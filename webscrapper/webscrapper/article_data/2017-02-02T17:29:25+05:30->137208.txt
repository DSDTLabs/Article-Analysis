It’s a known fact that   collegians can’t spend much time in public places or even their respective campus after working hours. The authorities maintain the stance that there is no need for students to loiter around in campus once the lectures are over. The security guards don’t even let students wait up in college parking. “You would think that you might breathe easily once you are out of the campus and standing on road, but no! Once you are out, the police will immediately shoo you from  . It’s like we collegians are outcast, we are not even supposed to exist in public places,” adds Harshali Pardeshi, an arts student.

  Even if the students aren’t allowed to do time pass at their favourite college katta, they have found a way out and so have the small entrepreneurs in city. To cash on the space problem of youngsters, many small tea and snack joints have come up. These joints have become a new hangout places for the city collegians. In last six months, three sophisticated tea joints have come up at College Road and surrounding areas. 
 
  “We offer tea and a place where youngsters can spend some quality time with their friends,” says Prashant Koli, owner of a tea bar at College Road. These small tea joints are a cheap alternative for expensive coffee shops for city youth. “Rs 15 ki   aur mann ki shanti, that’s what these joints are for me,” says Ishita Shah, a management student. “We often sit here and discuss study notes as well. Other times, it’s a best hideout place for us after bunking lectures,” she further adds.
