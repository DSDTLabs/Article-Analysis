CHENNAI: Claiming that the petition moved against his election from RK Nagar assembly constituency is baseless and cooked up with unsubstantiated allegations, T T V   has sought the   to dismiss the plea.

 Recording the pleadings filed by Dhinakaran opposing the   moved by M L Ravi, an independent candidate who contested the bypoll and secured 246 votes, Justice G Jayachandran posted it to June 5 for the petitioner to file his response. The primary allegation of Ravi, who contested on behalf of Desiya Makkal Sakthi Katchi (DMSK), was that the bypoll held on December 21 was marred by corrupt practices and was not free and fair. Denying the allegations, Dhinakaran submitted that the basis of the petition is fraudulently untenable, misconceived, misdirected and full of falsehood. The allegations were not substantiated with material evidence and the plea deserves to be dismissed, he said.
