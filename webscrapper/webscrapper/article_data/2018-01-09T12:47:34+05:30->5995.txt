TRICHY: Even as the state transport workers enter fifth day with their agitation demanding a revised pay, a section of DMK-affiliated-Labour Progressive Front ( ) threatened to operate buses without collecting fares if they are forced to return to duty.

 The   transport corporation sent notices to strikign worker, asking them to return to work considering the welfare of the public. The notices were served to about 9,000   employees spread over six regions of the corporation, including 2,500 in   region, 1,400 in Nagapattinam regions, and in equal numbers across Trichy, Karur, and   regions.
 
 Though the trade unions of transport corporation workers are demanding a wage hike in multiplications of 2.57 (basic pay multiplied by 2.57) the government is only agreeing a salary revision in multiplication of in 2.44.
 
 The TNSTC sources said that about 90 per cent of the government buses in Kumbakonam transport corporation are being operated with the help of part-time drivers and conductors. However, the TNSTC workers refuted the claim saying around 95 per cent of the transport workers are taking part in the ongoing stir.
 
 “We issued notices asking the striking TNSTC workers to return to work. We will wait for the employees to provide an explanation for not showing up for work,” a senior TNSTC official with Kumbakonam transport corporation said. Following this, a section of transport employees belonging to LPF stuck a notice on mofussil depot in Trichy Williams Road, threatening to operate the buses without charging fares.
 
 “If TNSTC forces us to operate buses without addressing our concerns, we will not issue tickets to passengers. As Pongal gift, transport workers from 10 trade unions, including LPF, CITU, AITUC of Trichy mofussil bus depot, will operate the buses without collecting fares,” R Selvan, secretary, LPF, Trichy Mofussil bus depot told TOI.
