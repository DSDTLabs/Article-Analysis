Not every day does the south come to Kolkata, bag and baggage. So, it was indeed a surprise when I heard  , the   maker, will soon be reaching the city where he has set his next,  . There are reasons why the news got me dumbfounded. The last time he had come here, there was such a big ruckus; its outcome is still discussed and dissected in hushed whispers! In 2014, Murugadoss turned up secretly to shoot Kaththi with Ilayathalapathy Vijay and Samantha in Kolkata. Back then, he had cast apna   as the villain — international ganglord Vivek Banerjee. The team would shoot chase sequences all night and managed to keep it under wraps till they were done. But the moment the news was out in the open, a miffed Murugadoss snipped out a few scenes that had Tota, or so I was told. Unlike in Kolkata, south makers do their best to make their stories stand out and nobody is allowed a sneak preview till the film’s release. This time too, the team has gone back to its old game — the unit has booked hotels and locations are locked away from the media glare. I heard action sequences with expensive cars will be shot in Rajarhat and with his lead actor Vijay’s growing popularity in south, it was easier for the director to shift the shoot elsewhere. Only last year, Vijay’s blockbuster movie Mersal was mired in controversy as it angered the state BJP in   with its references to GST. But anonymity is not something Murugadoss can ask for from this industry that takes a cue from south films every now and then. If I am not wrong, the director is a big hit on the laptop, much like his films.
