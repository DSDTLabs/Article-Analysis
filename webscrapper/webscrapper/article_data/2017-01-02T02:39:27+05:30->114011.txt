BUXAR/PATNA: Five convicts, including four serving life term, escaped from   on Friday night.

 Prajit Singh, Devdhari Rai, Sonu Pandey, Upendra Sah were serving life sentence, while Sonu Singh was undergoing 10 years’ imprisonment. The five convicts scaled the prison wall by using iron rods, pipes and a ‘dhoti’, a police officer said.
 
 “The escapees improvised the available material and climbed down from first floor of the ward through the ventilator and then jumped the 22ft-high inner periphery wall before scaling the 12ft-high outer wall,” the officer said.
 
 Following the incident, inspector general (prisons) Anand Kishor suspended three jail officials, including chief warden Kameshwar Paswan and wardens Upendra Das and Rajkumar Ram.
 
 “The   building is very old. The ward in which the convicts were kept was originally a tuberculosis hospital ward, which was later turned into a prisoners’ ward. Repairing works were carried out and the ventilator was blocked with bricks as the iron rods were rusted,” said Buxar SP Upendra Kumar Sharma, adding that the convicts removed the bricks and escaped.
 
 Sharma said out of the five escapees, brothers of two and father of one are also in the same ward. They were being interrogated.
