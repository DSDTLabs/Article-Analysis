PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Maharashtra   Rail Corporation Limited ( ) has proposed to extend the Pimpri-Swargate Metro route up to Nigdi and Katraj in the first phase itself. Work is on to create a detailed project report (DPR) for the two extensions. 

 Various social organizations as well as political parties have demanded that the route be extended. As a result, the   (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) wrote to MMRCL seeking a DPR.
 
 Brijesh Dixit, managing director of MMRCL, stated , "Our consultants have already started work on creating the DPR. They will have to conduct a survey of the topographical, geo-technical and traffic conditions, apart from an environment and social impact analysis. They also have to study the signalling work and rolling stock."
 
 Once the report is ready in about four months, it will be submitted to the state government for approval. A final approval for the project will come from the union government, the official added.
 
 Work on the Pimpri-Dapodi stretch began nearly six months ago and an area between Kharalwadi and Nashik Phata chowk has been barricaded. Further ahead, construction work is on from Megamart to College of Military Engineering (CME) chowk in Dapodi. MMRCL has deployed traffic wardens as well as a quick response team on the Pimpri-Dapodi stretch to reduce traffic congestion on the highway.
 
 “Construction of pillars and laying of segments will be completed in next one year but work on the stations will continue until later. Barricades around pillars can be removed after completing the work. We will construct crash barriers around the pillars to prevent any damage.,” Dixit explained.
 
 Talking about the project status, another official said, “Foundation work on 66 pillars is done. Moreover, work on 28 pillars and nine pillars with caps is also complete.”
