Panaji: Could the   jetty area be transformed if its plethora of economic activities were enhanced and strengthened by new, government-funded interventions? Most certainly, if a recently prepared architectural module is anything to go by. 

 Renowned South African architect Heinrich Wolff, has collaborated with final year students of the Goa College of Architecture in preparing ‘Better Betim’, an architectural speculation about the future of the popular fishing jetty and what it could look like if its urban circulation networks and economic activities were given a shot in the arm.
 
 The group has investigated the correlation between economic and urban matrices, thus enriching its understanding of how architecture can help dispel economic inequality and become a force of social change.
 
 The module looks at ways architects can expand the urban network of services, roads and pedestrian networks to make the area more accessible. As a result, the team has been speculating the possibilities that can come about by connecting Betim jetty to Panaji city by way of a pedestrian bridge.
 
 “While a regular bridge connects cars at an inter-state level, making another bridge for pedestrians will improve the city’s urban networks, inter-connectedness and economic opportunity,” Wolff says.
 
 He adds that by building a pedestrian network, citizens could visit Betim regularly, which would not be the case if it were a bypass instead. “This, in turn, will help the local crafts market or the fisheries market and architecture can therefore, be a force for social change.”
 
 The ‘Better Betim’ project was conducted under the Charles Correa Chair programme. An exhibition showcasing a 6mx3m model of the area and digital projections, will be open for public viewing at Kala Acdemy, Panaji, on Wednesday and Thursday.
