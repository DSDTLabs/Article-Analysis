GHAZIABAD: The owner of the Audi car that collided with an autorickshaw killing four persons on January 28 had not hired a regular driver, the maintenance incharge of  , where the owner stays, said.

 “We issue passes to maids, drivers, milkman and others. There is no record with us which suggests that Dr   had applied for any driver’s pass,” said Sudama, the maintenance incharge. In fact, the other guards at Olive County did confirm that it was Dr Manish Rawat who used to drive the Audi.
 
 When TOI asked whether Dr Rawat was seen driving his Audi just before the accident, Sudama said: “Though we have CCTV cameras installed, we don’t store data beyond three days. So it is difficult to say whether he was driving the car or not.”
 
 Meanwhile, the investigation into the collision is heading nowhere as the police, after serving notice to the alleged driver  , are content playing the waiting game.“Notice has been served and we are waiting for him to appear before us for questioning,” said Anil Yadav, circle officer, Indirapuram.
 
 There is hardly any serious effort on the part of police to trace Dr Rawat as well. “Dr Manish Rawat, who used to stay in flat number 902 in A5 tower, has not returned since the accident took place on January 28. The flat remains locked,” said Sudama. 
 
 The details that have emerged so far is that the said flat had been rented out to one KB Tripathi, by the owner  , on December 15 last year.
 
 According to a resident of Olive County, K B Tripathi happens to be the father-in-law of Dr Manish Rawat. “I came in contact with Dr Manish Rawat recently when I was introduced to him by a common friend. Dr Rawat was availing my parking space, No. 1812, which I had rented out to him for Rs 2,000 per month,” said Pandit Gaurav, an Olive County resident.
