PUNE: E-wallets are losing popularity to cash and  , report   in the city.

 Lack of public awareness about mobile phone safety at petrol pumps is leading to not only confusion, but also  .
 
 Using mobile phones at petrol pumps is strictly prohibited as the electric charge generated by from its battery, can result in a major fire if it comes in contact with the fuel vapours floating in and around the fuelling station. 
 
 Most e-wallet companies have issued a ‘standard operating procedure’ for transacting at petrol pumps. However, very few customers follow them, making the entire process extremely dangerous, petrol dealers say.
 
 “We have been told by almost all e-wallet companies to follow certain norms. The most important among those is maintaining a minimum distance between the fuelling and the transaction points. However, most customers refuse to move away from their vehicles or argue about the time wasted in this process. It’s unfortunate that people are not aware of these procedures, which are for their own safety,” the city sales manager of a petroleum company, said.
 
 Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer of the city said, “A minimum distance of 10 metres must be maintained between the fuelling point and the mobile phone to pay safely using e-wallets.” 
 
 Customers too pinpoint the mismatch between safety guidelines and the recent announcement by the Union government encouraging payment through e-wallets at petrol pumps.
 
 Vineeta Sharma, a customer at a petrol pump on Baner Road said, “E-wallets are helpful, but they can’t be used everywhere, especially at petrol pumps where mobile phone usage is prohibited. I prefer to pay for petrol by card or cash.”
 
 Another customer, Shakti Mishra said, “I am not sure, but I think using mobile phones at petrol pumps to make calls is dangerous. I think e-wallets are usually safe. However, I prefer paying by cash or card.”
