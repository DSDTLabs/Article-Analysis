LUCKNOW:   chief   on Saturday shot back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s SCAM (S-Samajwadi, C-Congress, A-Akhilesh and M-Mayawati) remark accusing him of being casteist, driven by petty politics and trying to hide corruption that ensued in the garb of the demonetisation exercise.

 Mayawati slammed Modi for making personal attacks, which she said was indicative of his nervousness and frustration ahead of UP assembly elections. She said the remark was also reflective of BJP’s   mindset. Mayawati said that PM may have exhorted the people to get rid of the corrupt but his own party was the biggest saviour of the corrupt and originator of all social and economic evils. 
 
 “Modiji khud sheeshe ke ghar mein rehte hain...parantu doosro ke gharon mein patthar maarna nahi bhulte hain... (  himself lives in a glass house but doesn’t forget to throw stones at others),” Mayawati said.
 
 The BSP boss also accused the PM of taking political advantage from the ‘surgical strikes’. “He never realised it...Modi can go to any extent to gain political mileage,” Mayawati said in a statement.
 
 The former UP chief minister said that BJP not fulfilling its promises made to the people during Lok Sabha elections was going to be the key issue this poll season. “The BJP is now nervous as it could not fulfil the promises it made to the electorate,” she said. Mayawati also attacked the BJP of not revealing the details of transactions it made 10 months before demonetisation.
