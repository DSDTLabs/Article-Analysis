Panaji: The district and sessions court on Friday will pronounce the order on the bail plea of Imran Khan, a businessman arrested by the special investigative team (SIT) as accused in the illegal mining case. Khan was arrerested on Tuesday evening in connection with an illegal mining case registered in 2013.

 The principal district and sessions judge, North Goa, Irshad Agha, posted the bail plea for order at 4pm on Friday. On Wednesday, the court had sent him to custody for two days.
 
 Prosecution counsel G P Kirtani resumed arguments today morning, and submitted why it was important for SIT to have custody of Khan. “His custody is required for proper investigation as they have evidence that he operated the mine. Transactions of huge of amounts have taken place. There have been RTGS transfers. The ore extracted was of value over Rs 200 crore,” Kirtani said.
 
 Kirtani also pointed out that Khan had power of attorney of a mine in Sanguem. “The lease of that mine was in the name of Amalia Figueiredo. Khan had control of operation of the mine and his custodial interrogation was required to get to the bottom of the case. He had powers to carry out extraction, supervise and manage the mine,” Kirtani said.
 
 Senior counsel Nitin Sardesai. who appeared for Khan, told the court that this argument can’t hold good because Khan was not the “lessee.” The case should be made against the lesee and not the applicant who acted as an attorney. 
 
 In response to the corruption charge, Sardesai questioned as to why not a single officer has been named in the police reply, to prove that applicant bribed to officials to get his work done.
