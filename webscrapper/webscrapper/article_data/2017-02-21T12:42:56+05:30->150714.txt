PANAJI: It will be a reunion to remember for nearly 300 ex-students from St Britto’s High School, St Mary’s Convent High School and St Xavier’s College—all in Mapusa—who are joining in the Grand Reunion 2017.

 More than 120 former students have flown in from Canada, Australia, London and Spain, among other countries to catch up with their old classmates, for a trip down memory lane.
 
 The fourth reunion of BMX, an alumni association comprising students of the three institutions, organised by   Goa Trust began on Monday and will continue for the next five days.
 
 A bronze bust donated by the alumni—of Fr  , the longest serving principal of St Xavier’s College, Mapusa, who held the reins of the institute between 1964 and 1989—was unveiled at the inaugural ceremony on Monday evening.
 
 For  , an alumni of St Britto High School (1968) and St Xavier’s College (1971), the journey all the way from Perth, Australia, has been completely worth it. “I can’t wait to reminisce in person with my old school and college friends. It is going to be a unique experience for my spouse and I. We’re looking forward to taking back memories and pictures of the reunion back to the rest of our family and friends back home, down under.”
 
 The ex-students have an exciting itinerary lined up for them, comprising a picnic with activities, games and the works, and a boat cruise along the River Mandovi during which they will be treated to folk dances, mandos and a fellowship dinner.
 
 The reunion will culminate with a grand carnival dance at Mapusa. 
 
 “St Britto’s, St Mary’s and St Xavier’s were the three leading educational institutions in Bardez in the 1960s-70s and we long for our old college days. It’s going to be a nostalgic reunion,”  , one of the oldest committee members living in Goa, says.
