PUNE: Anish Mahajan, an IT professional, will be going on a trip to Goa with his family over the Republic Day weekend — the year’s first official  . He is not the only one. In fact, tour companies claim the three-day break has created the perfect opportunity for hundreds to go on a mini-vacation. So much so, that there is currently a shortage of 15-seater buses and tempos, most of which have already been booked by groups of travellers.

  operators also said there has been over 40% rise in bookings to New Delhi, mostly by people who want to see the Republic Day parade. Mahabaleshwar, Lonavla, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala too have emerged as the top weekend spots. Incidentally, the average airfares in some of the Pune sectors have also dipped by between Rs1,000 and Rs 2,000 when compared to the same period in 2017.
 
 Santosh Gupta of Shree Vinayak Holidays said, “There has been a 70% increase in travellers during the R-Day weekend in comparison to long weekends in the past.”
 
 
  
 
 Shravan Gupta, the executive director of Leisure Businesses, FCM Travel Solutions India, said, “Easy visas have made international hotspots like Singapore, Thailand, Bali, the Maldives and Mauritius very attractive. Dubai has also seen an increased interest because of the Dubai Shopping Festival.”
 
 Sharat Dhall, the chief operating officer (B2C) of Yatra.com, said that domestic airfares on the Pune route are on the lower side this year because of an increase in the capacity by new entrants and the incumbent players.
