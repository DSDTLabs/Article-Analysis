PONDA: Goa Dairy on Thursday hinted at a possible hike in milk prices, its second in six months. The last hike was effected from September 1, 2016.

 Goa Dairy’s officiating chairman   cited shortage of milk and higher procurement prices paid to suppliers of buffalo milk as the reason behind the move. Sahakari’s decision comes at a time when the election of the co-operatives directors is being challenged before the high court.
 
 Sahakari told reporters that the dairy is losing Rs 1 on every litre of milk it supplies. Goa Dairy supplies about 85,000 litres of milk in the local market, including 15,000-20,000 litres of buffalo (full cream) milk procured from other states, the procurement rate for which has gone up. 
 
 Except a single hike made by then chairman   on July 1, 2014, almost all hikes have been made during Sahakari’s chairmanship, leading to the rate of milk more than doubling. Between 2007 and 2012, Sahakari as chairman hiked milk prices on over seven occasions. 
 
 Sahakari lost the chairmanship in the 2012 election, but was a director on the board. He returned as chairman on July 29, 2016.
