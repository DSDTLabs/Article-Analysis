CHANDIGARH: Amid allegations of Dalits being overlooked in the recent cabinet expansion, Punjab minister for technical education   met party president   in Delhi on Wednesday. 

 He was accompanied by disgruntled party MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian, who had resigned from party positions in protest against "inadequate" representation to Dalits in the cabinet. Deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti too was in the meeting Rahul, who was accompanied by Priyanka Gandhi.
 
 Channi, who posted a picture of the meeting on his social media, was not available for comments. Channi himself is a prominent Dalit face of the party. On Monday, Amritsar (West) MLA Raj Kumar Verka briefed the party president in this regard.
 
 According to sources, a group of Congress legislators, including Verka and deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti, has pointed out to the party leadership that among the Dalit community, it is the Valmiki and Mazhabi Sikhs who are feeling left out.
