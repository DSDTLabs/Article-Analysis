LUDHIANA: Local bodies minister   have ordered the   officials to postpone the floating of expression of interest (EOI) for allotment of a parking site in Model Town Extension. The officials have to wait for the new   before allotment of the site to any contractor. This came after a city-based   activist raised questions over the civic bodyâ€™s move to float tender for allotment of the site.

 The activist had filed the complaint on April 4, in which he had raised questions on the terms and conditions fixed for the contractor. He even expressed his doubts on the intention of the official. He had alleged that the terms and conditions have been uploaded without fixing the parking fee, and instead of fixing it for 1 year, licence would be issued for 5 years, which may be extended for further three to five years. 
 
 He also pointed out that there was no condition about monthly pass facility and e-ticket system. He had also alleged that designated parking sites and advertisement sites have not been demarcated in the tenders. When the matter reached the minister, he immediately put a stay on the move. 
 
 Confirming the same, the MC commissioner   said following directions from the minister, they have postponed the EOI for this parking site. He said it was actually the decision of the previous house to allot this parking site to a particular person. But instead of doing that, they decided to select suitable bidders. However, they will now wait for further directions from the government.
