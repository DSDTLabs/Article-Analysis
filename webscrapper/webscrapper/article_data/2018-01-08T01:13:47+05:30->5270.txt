NOIDA: A 32-year-old man was arrested on Sunday on the complaint of a woman who alleged that he took her to Australia and dumped her there after sexually exploiting her for two years on the pretext of marriage. The woman found herself in a sticky situation in Australia as she did not had not enough money to stay there. She somehow managed to return last week. 

 According to the woman, after reaching India, when she contacted the accused, he even refused to identify her. 
 
 Cops produced the accused, Laxmikant, in court which sent him to judicial custody.
 
 According to police, Laxmikant had a mobile phone accessories factory, where his girlfriend also worked. However, over a period of time, the business ran into losses and he was unable to manage the firm.
 
 The woman had invested some money in the company but got no returns. She said that Laxmikant convinced her to sell her flat and invest Rs 10 lakh in the company, which she did. 
 
 Last month, Laxmikant took her to Australia on a business trip. “They lived together for some 20 days in Australia. However, Laxmikant suddenly returned to India without informing her,” said a police officer.
 
 The woman panicked as she had not enough money to stay there. She informed some of her relatives and somehow managed a return ticket to India. The woman then visited Laxmikant and asked him about his rude behaviour for leaving her alone in Australia. “The accused even refused to identify me,” the woman said in the FIR.
