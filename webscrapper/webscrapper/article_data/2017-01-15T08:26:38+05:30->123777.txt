CHANDIGARH: Former Punjab chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala passed away on Saturday evening. Barnala, 91, was admitted to PGIM ER, Chandigarh, and was suffering from a urine and lung infection.Barnala was admitted on January 12 in the cardiac care unit of the PGIMER.He was later shifted to the respiratory intensive care unit where he died on Saturday . According to the doctors in the PGIMER, Barnala was a patient of coronary artery disease and died due to septic shock and pneumonia.

 Born on October 21, 1925, at Ateli village in Haryana, Barnala served as the state's CM from September 29, 1985, to June 11, 1987. Apart from being the CM, the veteran Akali leader served as a Union minister twice, in 1977 and 1998. He remained the governor of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand for over a decade.
 
 He served as Union agriculture minister in 1977, in the   government headed by Morarji Desai. He again served as the Union chemical and fertilizer minister and Union sports minister in the   government headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee.Barnala's wife, Surjit Kaur, said, “He was admitted to PGIMER on Thursday and breathed his last at around 4.30 pm today. His body will be taken to Barnala on Sunday .“
 
 During the last months of his life, Barnala's family had merged his outfit, SAD (Longowal), into the Congress, but he had stayed away from it. In an interview with TOI on April 7, 2015, when his grandson Simar Partap Singh was fielded by   in the Dhuri assembly bypoll, Barnala had said, “Though my family members have joined Congress, I will die an Akali.“
 
 He remained in Akali Dal along with chief minister  . Both shared a love-hate relationship and had parted ways in 2010, when Barnala's wife had floated SAD (Longowal). Both Barnala and Badal had termed each other as traitors after parting ways.
 
 After he lost from Sangrur parliamentary constituency in 1999 to SAD (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann, Barnala had withdrawn from active politics. He was appointed as the first governor of the newly-carved state of Uttarakhand in November 2000. In November 2004, he was appointed the governor of Tamil Nadu and came back on August 31, 2011, after relinquishing charge. He had won assembly elections in 1967, 1969, 1972, 1980, and 1985. He had become the Punjab CM after, he along with former SAD president Harchand Singh Longowal, had signed the Punjab accord with the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985.
 
 He had also won parliament elections from Sangrur in 1977, 1996 and 1998. He had become the Union fertilisers and chemicals minister before getting the post of governor in 1999. In between, his wife Sur jit Kaur had won assembly election from Barnala in 1977 and son Gaganjit from Dhuri in 2002.
 
 
 
 Barnala faced much criticism for not resigning from the CM's post when Chandigarh was not transferred to Punjab on January 26, 1986 ­ the date stipulated by the Punjab Accord signed between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and SAD president Harchand Singh Longowal. Many had said that he was “clinging to the chair“. However, he won acclaim in 1999, when he refused to toe the Centre's line as Tamil Nadu governor and did not send an adverse report against the then M Karunanidhi government.
 
 
 
 
 Though he was an Akali, Barnala had friends across the political spectrum. He played a key role, along with Balwant Singh, in signing of Punjab Accord. He became SAD president and then Punjab CM.He came to the centre stage by pushing Parkash Singh Badal to the fringes. In Akali circles, it is said that his name was being considered as PM candidate when no party got a clear majority in 1996. However, then SAD president Badal announced unconditional support to BJP.
