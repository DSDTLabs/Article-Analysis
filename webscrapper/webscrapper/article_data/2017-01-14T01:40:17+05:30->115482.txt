Forget ���Why did Kattappa kill B��hubali?���; the question that has been on the lips of most Kollywood fans for the past week has been this ��� ���Who is the music director of   Vasudev Menon���s Enai Noki Paayum Thota?��� And the buzz has only gotten stronger ever since New Year���s Eve, when the team released a teaser of a song, Maru Varthai Pesathey from the film, starring   and Megha Akash. 

 Gautham himself has been cryptic about this, and following the teaser���s release, tweeted, ���A song is mostly judged or liked also by who the music director is. Please listen to #MaruVarthaiPesathey&like it purely on it���s own merit.��� (sic). We hear that the team has been planning to turn this buzz around the identity of the composer into marketing strategy the album.
 
 Well, now, the cat is out of the bag. The director, who has so far worked only with Harris Jayaraj, AR Rahman and Ilaiyaraaja, has brought on board a relative newcomer,  , as the music director. Siva is the composer for the Sasikumar-starrers Kidaari and Bale Vellaya Theva. Interestingly, Gautham had released a single from Kidaari, which marked Siva���s debut as a composer. ���I liked what I heard. A new sound in music. Sasikumar���s Kidaari with music by Darbuka Siva. @SasikumarDir Welcome Siva,��� Gautham had tweeted then.
