NEW DELHI: After the Delhi high court on Thursday sought suggestions to tackle   in the city, two wildlife groups have highlighted immuno-contraception using vaccines and laparascopic sterilisation as solutions. 

  The two bodies - NGO Wildlife SOS and   (WII) - said the two could be used as both short-term and long-term measures to reduce the simian population. 
 
 The officials said immuno-contraception could be used as a long-term solution however; it would still require testing that could take up to five years. 
 
  Advocate  , petitioner in the matter, said sterilisation by laparoscopy and vaccination procedures are an ideal short-term measure. Wildlife SOS, which had conducted the laparascopy, also said that both the methods could prove to be beneficial in the long run. The   bench has directed authorities to prepare an action plan to be submitted to the Centre.
