Harnandi, a resident of the  , died of excessive bleeding from the head and nose by the time she was treated by doctors. 

 The police have recovered the taxi, a Swift Dzire, from outside the hospital and launched a manhunt to nab the driver, Pawan Sharma.
 
 Around 9am, Harnandi went to dump garbage outside her house when the taxi rolled down and crushed her. According to Harnandi’s son, Amarchand, Sharma was repairing the car near the garbage bin and had released the brake. Before he could control the vehicle, it hit the victim who was returning after disposing of the garbage. As locals started gathering around a severely injured Harnandi, Sharma offered to take her to the hospital in his taxi. However, at the hospital, he dumped her and fled even without the car. 
 
 Soon after the accident, locals informed Amarchand, who works at a private firm in south Delhi. “I kept looking for my mother at all hospitals around AIIMS and was finally informed by doctors at Safdarjung Hospital about her,” said Amarchand. Harnandi’s husband died a few years ago. 
 
 Harnandi’s body was handed over to her son after an autopsy. The police said an initial probe had revealed that Sharma used to drive the taxi owned by someone else and was checking the vehicle for a tyre puncture when the incident took place. A case under IPC 304A (causing death due to negligence) has been registered against him.
