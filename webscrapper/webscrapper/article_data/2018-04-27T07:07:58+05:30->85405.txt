HYDERABAD: With mercury levels soaring, the city is witnessing a steep rise in demand for air conditioners, air coolers and refrigerators, on rent.

 According to suppliers, the demand is particularly high in areas such as Gachibowli, Kondapur and   that house a large community of migrants.
 
 
  
 “Usually between April and June, the number of people renting summer appliances goes high drastically. This year, however, the demand is significantly higher given the extreme weather conditions. A large part of our clientele comprises hostel owners from the IT belt. Sometimes, meeting their demand becomes impossible for us,” said  , a local shop owner from Madhapur. He added: “The rent of an air cooler for a month this year Rs1,050. But if someone is willing to rent it for a three-month period, we are extending discounts.”
 
 Given the rush, most suppliers in the city are seen flooding customers with similar 'summer special' offers. SabRentKaro, the Hyderabad based start-up has already started offering #RentKaroCool-Karo to its customers. This offer gives a chance to the customers to rent for two months and get an extra month for free at a cost of Rs 8,500. The refrigerator can also be taken for rent at a cost of Rs 2,200 for a month.
 
 “These offers have come as a huge relief for people like me who were just not prepared for such a harsh summer. Because I have moved to the city for a limited period of time, I didn’t see any point in buying an air-conditioner. So, I just rented it,” said  , an HR professional, who moved to Hyderabad recently.
 
 Confirming to the rush this summer, a survey conducted by GrabOnRent, an online product rental marketplace, revealed that refrigerators top this list of in-demand appliances, in Hyderabad. Speaking about the local market, the company’s CEO,  , said: “The average monthly expenses on rentals is Rs 1,684. We've partnered with more than 100 local suppliers and it has been a journey of sheer trust.” (By: Rijas Das)
