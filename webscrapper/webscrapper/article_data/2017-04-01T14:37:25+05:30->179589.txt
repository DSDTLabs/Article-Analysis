KOLKATA: All foods were bought with fears of adulteration except eggs, but that doesn’t apply anymore. This, ever since “plastic eggs” surfaced recently in Tiljala.

 Based on a complaint filed by Tiljala’s Anita Kumar, Kolkata’s civic body sat up abruptly. On Friday, the administration jumped into the fray to seize fake eggs. On Saturday morning, the main accused, Mohammed Shamim Ansari of Park Circus Market was arrested by policemen from the Kareya station. The wholesale market from where the eggs were bought was also raided by food safety officials led by Member, Mayor in Council Atin Ghosh. A control room has also been set up for customers to alert the administration about the sale of fake eggs, whenever found. Lalbazar’s Enforcement Branch is probing the case actively.
 
 Both consumers and sellers are now wary of dealing with eggs, because none can be too sure about what’s going on sale – the real or the fake stuff. Customers too are feeling helpless, because it’s impossible to discern between the two. Kanta De, a housewife from Sodepur, says: “We cook eggs daily, in some form or the other. After hearing about these plastic eggs, I’m not even sure which ones to buy.” Friday, MMIC Atin Ghosh raided the wholesale egg market at Manindra Mitra Row in  , the same place from where MS Ansari had bought a consignment worth Rs 95,000. The civic body has also bought three crates of eggs from the same supplier and sent it across for lab testing.
 
 Not just eggs sold in the market, but also those served to children during midday meals would be tested for purity, Mayor   said. Buyers can contact the civic body control room at 033- 22861212 and 033- 22861218 to alert the administration in case of any leads in the case.
