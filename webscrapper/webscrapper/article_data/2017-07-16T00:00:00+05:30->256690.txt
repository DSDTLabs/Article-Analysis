In life, good and bad happen to all of us. The good is fine but how does one deal with the bad? In Latin, there’s a word called  , which means love of one’s fate. The philosophy says you don’t just accept your   but learn to love it. It may sound difficult as we’ve always been told that we make our own fate. While that may be true, even the best laid plans do — and have — gone awry, haven’t they? It’s called fate.

 If you accept life’s challenges, you accept the principle of Amor Fati by saying ‘yes’ to life and fate. The theory helps you look at the upside and downside of life, and teaches you life lessons for inner growth and transformation. Spiritualists believe this perspective helps you live in bliss. When life’s inevitable chaos throws you at a hard place, and you deal with it simply because there’s no other way, you also become aware of your own strength and the Universe’s power. 
 
 Jeff R Noordermeer, a Dutch who wrote about the bombing of Rotterdam, The Netherlands, during WWII in his memoirs, says accepting what life brings you helps you live to the highest levels as there is no conflict within you after that. Your situation is what it is. No amount of wishing for something different will change anything. If you face your problem, you begin to address it.
