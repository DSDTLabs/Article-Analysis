SHILLONG: Frustration was the dominant emotion for   in the last few minutes of their I-League match on Monday, and then beyond the blowing of the final whistle. While substitute Samad Ali Mallick got a yellow for an unnecessary off-the-ball spat in the dying minutes, another substitute Gabriel Fernandes almost got into a scuffle with Man-of-the-Match goalie Nidhin Lal after the game.

 
 The red and gold brigade’s frustration was understandable as their 2-2 draw against   at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here meant they have lost control of the race for the coveted title. With 30 points from 17 matches, Khalid Jamil’s team will now have to depend on the outcome of the last match of Minerva Punjab as well as their own tie against second-placed Neroca.
 
 Winning just two seats may have made BJP a key player in the state’s coalition government, but the two strikes from Dudu Omagbemi (20’, 88’) were inadequate for the visitors to cement their place as title contenders.
 
 It was, however, a decent end to the season for the hosts who finished their campaign on 21 points but will have to wait for the result of Gokulam Kerala’s tie on Tuesday to know if they end on the sixth or seventh spot. Skipper   kept up his reputation as the best Indian footballer in setpiece situations by assisting one and converting the next for his team.
