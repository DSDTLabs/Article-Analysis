KOZHIKODE: Chief minister Pinarayi   on Sunday termed the allegations regarding the political lenience of the   police association ( ) baseless. Refuting the allegations, the chief minister said that allegations of politicization of police association were raised by people who did not know the difference between the police force and the police association. 

 The chief minister was speaking at the concluding session of the KPA state convention at Iringal near Vadakara. "Some people have some problem with some colours," Vijayan said, referring to the controversies regarding the installation of red martyrs' column at police association conventions.
 
 "The police association has for long been remembering the martyrs' from the force and it cannot be compared to the martyrs' day observances of any political party," the CM said, adding that some people were considering it as a grave offence. 
 
 He also said that the organizational activities of the police would only strengthen the discipline of the force. The chief minister also praised the police force for their speedy investigation to identify those who propagated the recent hartal called by unidentified persons through social media. 
 
 "It was an attempt to create a riot-like situation in Kerala," Vijayan said. If the police force had not identified the persons behind the propaganda, it would have affected the communal harmony and secularism of our state, he added.
 
 "With changing times, the method of policing should also change and police are adopting new methods. There is an attempt to bring in positive changes to develop a healthy society. Many senior citizens are living alone and the police should give special care to ensure their protection," he added. 
 
 Some police personnel were spoiling the image of the force and strict action would be initiated against them, the chief minister said.
