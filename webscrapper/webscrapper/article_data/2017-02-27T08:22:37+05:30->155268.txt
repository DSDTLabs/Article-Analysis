CHENNAI: M G Ramachandran's niece Leelavathy, who donated her kidney for the   founder when he was being treated at Brooklyn Hospital in New York in 1984, officially joined the BJP on Sunday along with M C Rajendran (MGR's brother MC Chankrapani's son) and his son M C R Praveen. Speaking to reporters after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday,   said they decided to join the BJP because no other party could do a better job today. "MGR's image is being used for gaining political mileage. No one follows his ideas and vision. Only a powerful leader like Narendra Modi can work for the welfare of the people the way MGR did," she said. 

 Asked why they joined the BJP, a party which is struggling to find a base in Tamil Nadu, Praveen said, "I was a member in the AIADMK. But today, the party has lost its strength. It's like a ship without a captain. Many in that party have forgotten MGR. As a political party, BJP gives us a lot of confidence," he said.
 
 Leelavathy was the first donor when MGR was admitted at the Brooklyn Hospital. "My father was kept as the second donor in case of emergency," said Praveen. "Today, the AIADMK is at a dead-end. We lost hope in AIADMK after  's death," he said.
 
 Though they expressed their willingness to join the BJP on January 18, they officially declared their stand on Sunday following a meeting with the Prime Minister Modi on Friday. "We met Narendra Modi and he welcomed us into the party. We are planning to meet people, particularly those in the remote areas, in the coming days," said Praveen.
