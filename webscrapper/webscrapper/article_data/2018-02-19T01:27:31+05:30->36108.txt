NOIDA: Tourism minister   on Sunday launched the UP’s first OYO   in Noida’s Sector 62. Business analysts feel that a combination of long-delayed housing projects and the expanding corporate city will provide a substantial ground for the facility to develop.

 The   Township will provide mid to premier range properties starting from Rs 2,000 a night and is expected to bridge the need for accommodation for visiting corporate executives in the city.
 
 While OYO rooms simply offer a room or a few rooms in a hotel or a house, OYO   is an entire property managed by the chain. The company has announced it will expand its Townhouse footprint in Uttar Pradesh by 10 more such projects by 2018-end.
 
 “Noida is one of the fastest growing regions for OYO as the city offers robust opportunities for corporate travel to Uttar Pradesh for business. OYO entered the Noida market in November 2014 and currently offers 2,000 exclusively controlled rooms in the city as a part of its network,” said  , the COO of OYO.
 
 “The company plans to expand Townhouse hotels at other popular destinations, such as Lucknow and Ghaziabad. With rooms starting at Rs 2,000, Townhouse provides a unique hospitality experience in the heart of a popular neighbourhood. By 2018-end, OYO will launch 10 Townhouse properties in here,” he added.
