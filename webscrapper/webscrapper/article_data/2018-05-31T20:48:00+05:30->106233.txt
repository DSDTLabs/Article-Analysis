Bonny Sengupta is busy with his pet cat Puchai. “Puchai is unwell and I am really worried about him. He is suffering from gall bladder stones and will undergo surgery soon. Thankfully, I don’t have any shoot this month,” said a worried Bonny. He added, “I will start shooting for the last leg of Raja Chanda’s film along with Koushani (Mukherjee) from next month. Then, I have a film with Rajib where I will share screen space with Koushani and a debutante. From February, I will be shooting for Soumik Sen’s Kolkata Company where Prosenjit Chatterjee will play the antagonist.” Bonny is looking forward to the telecast of last episode of Superstar Adda
