MUMBAI: Even as chief minister   on Saturday ruled out the possibility of a threat to his government, a senior BJP cabinet member observed that in the event of a mid-term poll in the state, the BJP on its own will win at least 145 seats if voting trends for the justconcluded municipal councils, corporations and zilla parishads stay the course.

 “In the 2014 assembly polls, BJP had won 122 seats and had secured 27.81 per cent of the votes. In the just concluded municipal council, corporations and zilla parishad polls, BJP secured 28.19 per cent votes. In terms of the number of seats in the legislative assembly , we will get more than 145 seats. In a House of 288, we require 145 seats for a majority ,“ he said.
 
 The cabinet member said that out of 8.35 crore voters for the 288 assembly constituencies, less than 5.26 crore had exercised their franchise, while the total number of voters for the 212 municipal councils, 25 zilla parishads and 10 municipal corporations were 5.98 crore and covered 198 assembly segments. From the data released by the state government, it appears that compared to the 2014 assembly polls, more voters exercised their franchise in the zilla parishad, council and corporation polls.In terms of percentage, BJP secured 28.92 per cent votes in the BMC, 35.89 per cent in nine corporations, 27.36 per cent in zilla parishads and 23.82 per cent in councils, comprising 198 assembly segments. “BJP along with allies secured 1.81 crore votes in 198 assembly segments, in terms of percentage, it comes to 30.40,“ he said.
 
 The cabinet member said if one compares the votes polled during the 2014 assembly polls and in the municipal council, corporation and zilla parishads, it can be concluded that if the same performance is maintained, then BJP will secure 145 seats. “In 2014, we had won 122 seats, then we had polled 27.81 per cent votes. Now we have pol led 30.40 per cent, in terms of number of seats, it will be 145.In our opinion, it was not a mini-assembly election, but it was a litmus test for the 2019 assembly polls,'' he said.
 
 The cabinet member said ever since the election pro cess for the rural and urban bodies began, an uneasy calm had prevailed in the BJP over the likely performance of the BJP. It was then believed that in view of demonetisation and the public spat between   and BJP, it may be difficult for the BJP to have the same kind of performance it had had in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls. “From the outcome of the results, it appears that people have accepted the demonetisation decision. No doubt in Mumbai were unable to beat the Sena, but our performance was outstanding.From 31 seats in 2012, we won 82,“ he said. The cabinet member said since BJP had dropped the proposal to contest the mayoral polls, it appeared that BJP and Shiv Sena will join hands in the days to come, but in the event the Sena withdraws from the government, the BJP is prepared for mid-term polls.
