BAGALKOT: Somashekar Raddi Hubballi of   village, Laxmeshwar taluk in Gadag district, is now a star in his local   booth committee after he got a surprise call from national president   from   on Monday.

 Rahul, who was meeting senior leaders, block committee members and presidents, wanted to speak to a booth-level committee member to get feedback about the party in the state. He randomly selected a person and called him.
 
 Raddi, 56, was stunned to hear Rahul’s voice and initially did not believe it. He said: “I received a call from   president G Parameshwara who said   wanted to speak to me. I didn’t believe it when Rahul came on the line. As I can’t understand Hindi, I requested my state president to translate it into Kannada.’’ He added, “Rahul asked me about the response to the Congress in Badni, how the members are working and the vote share in the last election. I explained in Kannada and Parameshwara translated it into Hindi for Rahu.”According to him, Rahul promised to meet booth-level committee members when he visits Gadag district.
 
 “After this call, local party leaders are treating me like a star. I’m happy Rahul called an ordinary party worker like me. I’ll cherish it for the rest of my life,” Raddi, who has been in the party for four decades, said.
 
 Winding up his tour of Vijayapura and Bagalkot on Monday, Rahul, before flying to Ramdurg in Belagavi, emphasised the importance of strengthening booth-level committees to increase the party’s vote share and asked each leader, DCC president and block committee president to work hard to increase it and draw youth into the party.
 
 Basavaraj Huvinhalli, Bagalkot Youth Congress district secretary and Akram Soudhagar, Biligi youth unit’s vice-president, who attended the two-hour closed-door meeting with Rahul, said he noted down details of the trend in the constituency and votes polled in the 2013 polls.
