MUMBAI: A man who sold his flat to try his luck at   has landed behind bars after the   (AIU) of airport Customs caught him on Wednesday while he and his wife were walking out of the city airport with four kg   worth Rs 1 crore. 

 The woman, Shivadevi Balachandran, had concealed the gold in her undergarment and was heading out of the airport with her husband, Balasubramaniam, when the customs officials intercepted her on suspicion.
 
 Initially, the woman denied any wrongdoing but she later confessed to the crime. Customs officials have seized the gold that the couple was carrying and arrested them.
 
 Balasubramaniam told investigators he is based in Chennai, where he lives along with his two wives. He recently sold his flat for Rs 65 lakh to try his luck at gold smuggling. His modus operandi was to use his wives to bring gold from abroad after evading customs duty and sell it for profit in India.
 
 Officials stated that he had succeeded a couple of times. Each time, he took a different wife abroad to avoid suspicion. He would tell the wives to conceal the gold in a specially made bra and smuggle it. Each time, he also landed at different airports.
