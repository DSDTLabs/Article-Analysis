UDAIPUR: The   (DRI) arrested a   and   Sanjay R Patel in Udaipur’s much-hyped   on Sunday. Patel who was produced before the special NDPS court here on Monday was   till March 1. This is the seventh arrest in the case and all the accused have been kept at Udaipur jail.

 Last year, on October 28, the DRI, Narcotics department and BSF in a joint action had raided a pharmaceutical manufacturing unit and its two godowns in Udaipur and Rajsamand and seized 23,320 kg (23.5 mt) of methaqualone tablets commonly known as Mandrax. It is a banned product under Schedule 1 of NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act.
 
 The DRI had claimed it to be the largest ever confiscated stock of the contraband drug anywhere in the world. The factory belongs to mastermind Subash Doodhani, who is also a Bollywood producer. DRI has been investigating the case since the seizure and suspects many more persons to be involved in the mega drug haul.
 
 Recently, on February 17, the DRI had raided the premises of Redimix Adhesive Technology, a firm in Nadiad in Gujarat and summoned the owner of the company Sanjay Patel to record his statements. Patel was interrogated in Jaipur and he allegedly confessed his role in the manufacture and export of the contraband drug. 
 
 “Mandrax used to be exported in containers from Patel’s factory. Since DRI didn’t demand his police custody, the court sent him to judicial custody,” Pravin Khandelwal, the special public prosecutor, told TOI.
 
 Six persons including a Bollywood producer and mastermind Subash Doodhani, his nephews Ravi and Nirmal Doodhani, investor Parmeshwar Vyas, chemist Atul Mhatre and former partner Anil Malkani have been arrested so far and investigation is still on.
