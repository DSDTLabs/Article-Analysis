  With the temperature hovering around 39-40 degrees Celsius for the last couple of days, there are apprehensions of sunburn cases and the government has regulated the timing of those working in the open under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the district.
 
  Some sunburn incidents were reported in the district during the very beginning of this summer season. However, health department officials said though sunburn deaths could occur when temperature touches 43-44 degrees Celsius, those with heart ailments could be affected even at less temperature, they said. They also warned of summer-related diseases like cholera, typhoid etc. The district has been experiencing severe heat wave in the past one week, apart from acute drinking water shortage with most of the water sources, including the Bharathapuzha and its tributaries, drying up early in November last year.
 
  Though Palakkad was experiencing climate change, as evident from the unprecedented rise in temperature and drought conditions, no steps have been taken to study it and suggest remedial measures. State Action Plan on Climatic Change (SAPCC) had listed Palakkad as one of the climate change hotspots in the state.
