CHENNAI: The   government on Monday announced   of 67 life convicts who have completed ten years in prisons in the state. 

 A government press release said the convicts would be released on the sidelines of former chief minister  's birth centenary.
 
 "The government following the footsteps of Puratchi Thalavi   (former chief minister J Jayalalithaa) releases 67 life convicts who have completed 10 years as on February 25, initially," the release said.
 
 The state home department issued orders and guidelines for early release in February and March as per the powers vested with governor under Article 161 of the Constitution and orders of the high court and the Supreme Court, it added.
 
 However, the statement hasnâ€™t mentioned the names of the convicts and the prisons they are lodged.
 
 
 
 
 The DMK was not happy with the way the government made the announcement. The party raised this issue in the assembly and asked how the government could announce it through an official statement when the assembly session was on. But the government said the announcement to release the convicts had been made long ago and it was a continuous process.
