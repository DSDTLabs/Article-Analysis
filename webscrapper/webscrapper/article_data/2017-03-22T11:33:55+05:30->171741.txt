DARBHANGA: Governor-cum-chancellor of universities of Bihar   unveiled the life size statue of   on the   (KSDSU) campus on Tuesday.

 Speaking on the occasion, Kovind said after independence most of the royal palaces of the erstwhile kings have either been converted into big hotels or the surviving scions of kings are utilizing them for their residential purposes. However, Kameshwar Singh donated his palaces for the housing of two universities – LNMU and KSDSU. “Darbhanga Raj is known for spreading education and establishing sugar factory, jute factory and Ashok Paper Mill,” Kovind added. 
 
 This unveiling of Kameshwar Singh’s life size statue was scheduled for two times earlier, but on one occasion Kovind could not come due to unavoidable reasons and on other occasion his plane was not given permission to proceed due to inclement weather and he had to return to Raj Bhavan from Patna airport.
 
 The chancellor suggested the Sanskrit scholars of KSDSU to translate the useful essence of Sanskrit into various languages for its adaptability and relevance. “Sanskrit language, if adopted, will prove a valuable asset for institutes of higher learning and research centres,” he said. The chancellor also inaugurated the newly built indoor stadium and examination hall in Sanskrit University.
 
 KSDSU VC Vidyadhar Mishra welcomed the chancellor and audience and former VC of the university Dev Narayan Jha proposed a vote of thanks. Laxmi Nath Jha, nominee of the surviving Maharani Kamsundri, was also present on the occasion.
