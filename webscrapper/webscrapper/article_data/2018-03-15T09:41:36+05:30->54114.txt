KOCHI: In an attempt to provide an avenue to generate a steady income for   members and to ensure the availability of chicken to consumers at reasonable prices, district Kudumbasree mission will launch Kudumbashree chicken project (broiler chicken production project) in the district soon. As part of the project, hatcheries and chicken sale outlets will be started. 

 The project is being jointly implemented by   (KEPCO), animal husbandry department, Kerala Veterinary and   and local self-government departments. The pilot Kudumbashree chicken projects are already underway in Thiruvanthapuram and Pathanamthitta.
 
  TR, district programme manager of the mission said they have selected a group of members who are into poultry farming and have the licence from the respective local self-government departments and infrastructure in this regard. "The high price of chicken and concerns over the quality of chicken arriving from neighbouring states forced us to start this project," Remya said.
 
 "Those who are interested in poultry farming can also be part of the project. We are also inviting applications through community development societies. An average of 100 Kudumbashree units will be established in the first phase," she said.
