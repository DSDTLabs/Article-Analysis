MUMBAI: The BJP-led   government has decided to buy 30 swanky cars for over Rs 5.8 crore to be used by VIPs on district visits. The state is over Rs 4.6 lakh crore in  .

 A senior official said a high-level committee did a review of vehicles available for visiting VIPs and it was decided to procure 30 vehicles for 15 districts. While five vehicles will be kept at the disposal of the Pune collector, there will be three each for Nashik and Ahmadnagar. The remainder will be handed over to the collectors of 12 districts. “By and large, these vehicles are provided to visiting cabinet members and VIPs during their official tours to the districts,” he said.
 
 Justifying the procurement, the official said quite a large number of vehicles at the disposal of district collectors were not in running condition and required major repairs, which involved much expenditure. In such circumstances, it was felt that instead of repairing the old vehicles the department should procure new vehicles.
 
 A Congress politician said that at a juncture when the debt burden had crossed Rs 4.6 lakh crore, the expenditure of Rs more than 5.8 crore to buy new cars was uncalled for. “In view of worst ever financial condition we were expecting a massive austerity drive, but it appears that the government is taking it casually. No efforts are visible to mobilise resources,” the politician said.
