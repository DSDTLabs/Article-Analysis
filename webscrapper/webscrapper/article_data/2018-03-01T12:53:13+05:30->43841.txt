 *   orbits Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System and the fifth from the Sun
 
 * Europa is one of Jupiter's 69 moons; the planet's fourth largest and slightly smaller than Earth's moon
 
 * The moon was discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610
  
 
 
 * Europa holds special promise for Nasa; under its 20-kilometre thick ice shell may lie an ocean of water some 100 kilometres deep
 
 * The saltwater ocean on the moon would fulfil one of three conditions necessary for life; the other two are chemical ingredients and energy sources
 
 
 
 
 * Europa is believed to have more water than Earth despite being 1/4th of our planet's size
 
 * Though the moon's surface pressure is lower than Earth's, Europa's thin atmosphere is primarily composed of oxygen
 
 * Europa may share some other characteristics with Earth; it may have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a magnetic field
 
 
 
 
 * The Europa Clipper mission hopes to confirm the moon's habitability by determining the presence of the three conditions for life
 
 * The mission will launch in the early 2020s and reach Europa after several years
 
 * A spacecraft will orbit the moon every two weeks for a total of about 45 flybys
 
 * During the flybys, the spacecraft will capture high resolution images of the surface and analyse its geology
  
 
 
 
 * The moon's young and smooth surface, the smoothest surface of any solid object in the Solar System, contributed to the theory that an ocean supporting life may exist underneath it
 
 * Heat generated by tidal flexing is believed to keep the ocean in liquid form, allowing it to absorb chemicals from the surface. These conditions lead scientists to believe in chances of finding life on the moon
 
 * Also, the potential existence of volcanic or hydrothermal activity on the moon's seabed would supply the necessary nutrients to support life
