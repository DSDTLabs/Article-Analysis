Thane: The civic general body meeting, on Monday, rejected the solid waste management tax levied on commercial outlets in the city thereby bringing relief to traders and owners of these units. 

 The tax was imposed for picking up litter from outside the shops and commercial units across the city. Any resistance to the tax by shop owners had resulted in the civic body dumping garbage outside their shops. Fed up with dumping of waste outside their stores, traders joined hands and protested outside the civic headquarters on March 23.
 
 The Thane Municipal Corporation ( ), over the past two months, had started levying a daily fee of Rs 25 (approximately Rs 750 per month) on each of these commercial units to clean the waste in front of their stores.
 
 Bharat Mota, president of Subhash Path Vyapari Welfare Association, said, “Instead of doing their work, the   spent the day dumping filth in front of each of our shops. In addition to protesting this nuisance at the TMC office, we also met CM Devendra Fadnavis on March 24 and received his support.”
 
 Mayor Meenakshi Shinde said, “We believe that there is no need to impose additional tax on commoners for   from outside the shops. We have to look for other avenues that increase the revenue without affecting the commoners. We have also opposed hikes on water and property tax.”
 
 “We have been opposing unnecessary taxes from the first day of the budget announcement, which was reflected in the general body decision. Why should citizens pay extra for the corporation’s work?” questioned Najib Mulla, NCP corporator.
