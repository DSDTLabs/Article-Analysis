 Sumit was shot several times on Friday night at his shop. Four empty cartridges of 9mm and three cartridges of 7.65mm were recovered from the spot, the SP said.
 
 Locals said Sumit was inside his recently opened shop when four criminals reached there on two bikes and started firing before fleeing towards Bailey Road.
 
 Police sources said Sumit was wanted in connection with recovery of carbine in Samastipur. “Sumit and his brother had also attacked a person with grenade. Sumit had tried several times to kill those involved in his father’s murder,” said a source.
