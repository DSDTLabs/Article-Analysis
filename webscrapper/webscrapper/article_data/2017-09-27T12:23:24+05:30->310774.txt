 Episode 22 was kick-started with the rollover contestant Neelesh ji from Gujarat. Much to everyone's delight, the entertainment quotient was considerably raised when the second contestant of the evening, Arun Singh Rana from Delhi, took the Hot Seat.
 
 He had arrived on the show with his wife as his jodidaar. When   asked about how he met his wife, Arun spilled the beans about his love life. Interestingly, the contestant's wife also opened up about the list of complaints she has with her husband.
  
 The story of this couple was interesting, to say the least. It kept everyone hooked, especially Big B.
  
  When Big B asked them if they are able to resolve their differences amicably Arun's wife said that their marital fights are 'healthy.'
  
 The first contestant on Tuesday's show, Neelesh ji from Gujarat, walked away with a prize money of Rs. 10,000 while Arun will continue to play tonight. We will have to wait and watch to know what's in store for him. Stay tuned in for more.
