NEW DELHI: The wait for the   of Delhi Metro’s   is finally over. The 25.6km-long corridor, which will directly link west Delhi to Noida, was flagged off by Union minister for housing and urban affairs   and chief minister   from the   station of the corridor on Monday.

 The corridor is the longest stretch to be opened as part of metro’s Phase-III so far. It consists of 16 stations and will provide connectivity to the Outer Ring Road. The corridor will also connect the airport’s domestic terminal with metro services for the first time.
 
 The first 12.6km-long section of Magenta Line between Botanical Garden in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir was inaugurated in December last year. The remaining section will put south Delhi areas, such as Vasant Vihar, Munirka, IIT, Greater Kailash and  , on the metro map for the first time. South Delhi will also come closer to Noida and west Delhi.
 
 The Magenta Line will considerably reduce travel time between west and south Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad and Noida. For instance, travelling between Hauz Khas and Janakpuri West, at present, requires an interchange from Rajiv Chowk that takes close to 55 minutes, but with the opening of the Magenta Line, the journey will take less than half an hour. 
 
 Travel time between Gurugram and Noida will also be slashed to just 50 minutes from the current one-and-a-half hours as commuters will be able to switch trains at the Hauz Khas station, instead of travelling all the way to Rajiv Chowk.
 
 For lakhs of residents of west Delhi, the only lifeline connecting them to the rest of the city is the Blue Line, which involves travelling up to Rajiv Chowk if they want to change trains to visit any other part of NCR. This will change with the opening of the Janakpuri West-Kalkaji Mandir section of the Magenta Line. The corridor will pass through heavily populated areas like Palam, Dabri, Mahavir Enclave, Sagarpur and Dashrathpuri.
