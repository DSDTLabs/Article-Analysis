NEW DELHI: Flagship explorer   will retain   as an independent group arm and continue with the company's brand after acquiring the government's stake in the country's third-largest state-run refiner-retailer. "HPCL is a good, professionally-run company and will continue to remain so. We also do not have any plan to tinker with its employee package, etc," ONGC chairman Shashi Shanker said on Sunday, a day after the government accepted its Rs 36,915-crore cash offer to buy the Centre's 51.11% holding in HPCL. 

 On rejigging the boards of ONGC and HPCL, essentially to make room for representatives of each company in the other's management, Shanker said, "These are minor issues that can be sorted out after the acquisition is completed." Shanker rejected the view that the acquisition will sap ONGC of the financial strength to go for overseas acquisitions, done through 100% subsidiary ONGC Videsh. "With the strength of a consolidated balance sheet (of ONGC and HPCL), ONGC will have a greater appetite for risk and look for better assets (overseas fields)."
 
 Shanker said ONGC has a plan to fund the acquisition but declined to share the details. "We have Rs 12,000-13,000 crore cash. Then there are liquid assets (minor holdings in   and gas utility GAIL) that we can sell. ONGC board has already raised the borrowing limit from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore. We also have offers from lenders, both domestic and foreign, for Rs 50,000 crore at very attractive rate," he said. "We may use our cash first and then the liquid assets. Debt will be last...We have worked on the borrowing offers in a way that ONGC will not have to pay penalty at any point," Shanker said.
