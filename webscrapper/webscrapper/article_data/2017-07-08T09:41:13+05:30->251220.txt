 In view of the grim situation, the health department has already sounded an alert across the district. Rapid response teams comprising of doctors, nurses, ASHA workers and para-medical staff have been formed in the state dispensaries, primary health centres, community health centres, first referral units and district hospitals to deal with the situation. The joint director added that long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) were being distributed among people in those pockets found to be highly susceptible to the vector-borne disease. Fogging was also being carried out in several areas of the district. 
 
 The outbreak of JE in the state usually coincides with the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons which are conducive for mosquitoes to breed. The three months from June to August are usually the peak period for the disease.
