JALANDHAR: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MP   said a delegation of party MPs would meet the Prime Minister and   petroleum minister next week to demand that petrol and diesel should be brought under the GST regime.

 “While in principle we are against bringing petrol and diesel under the GST as some revenue resources should be left with the state, but there appears to be no other alternative to down bring the prices,” said the   MP.
 
 He said his party would press for this solution despite the fact that it might harm resource mobilization by the states as the situation has reached a point when some hard decisions would have to be taken.
 
 He said the   had no moral right to protest on the issue as the state government had not reduced taxes on fuel. “The state government should also reduce its taxes so that burden on people can be reduced and if they take this step, we can raise the issue more strongly with the Union government”.
