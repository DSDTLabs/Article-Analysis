Panaji: The protests to lift the ban on Jallikattu, that has brought most of Tamil Nadu to a standstill, have made their way to Goa as well with members of the Tamil diaspora here taking out an awareness drive in Panaji. A group of protestors has been sitting in Panaji city with placards for the past three days.  Talking to TOI, a member of the group, Manikandan said that the protest in Goa was a show of solidarity with those in Chennai. “We are sitting here to inform people about the real meaning of Jallikattu, as those who are not familiar with it are being misinformed that the festival harms the bull. It is celebrated to test the masculinity and strength of the bull. We do not slaughter the bull post the festival,” he said, adding that the festival is an important part of the Tamil culture. The group also alleged that the ban has been implemented to promote import of foreign breeds of cattle into the country. “PETA and the Animal Welfare Board of India are helping in promoting the import of foreign bulls and cows in India. The bulls used in Jallikattu are local bulls, which are raised in the villages,” Santosh, another protester said, adding that the group is supportive of the Goan bull fighting sport of Dhirio, which itself is under scrutiny by a committee appointed by the state government. “Today they’re banning our cultural sports, tomorrow same thing will happen in Goa, Punjab and rest of the country,” he said.
