Vijayawada: In a major revelation, documents seized after an encounter between security forces and Maoists on May 17 in Panapadar village on Andhra-Odisha border (AOB), indicate that the Naxalites are mulling ‘militia pratighatana’, a programme that involves cadre in party activities. According to highly placed police sources, Maoists have even deputed an area committee member (ACM) in each area, for forming and developing militia sanghams (groups). 

 These groups will not stay in villages, but identify new places in forests to set up camps. They plan to train the cadre in military and political strategies, and convert them into full-time cadres. Sources said these cadres will be trained in making improvised explosive devices.
 
 The source of information is said to be   leader Ramakrishna alias RK’s diary. The Naxals are planning surprise attacks against security forces, instead of routine attacks, a source said. The security forces have mounted several attacks on the camps of Naxals, who are now planning to lay booby traps in the area. 
 
 They have decided to bolster the security around the camps, and are making plans to counter the security forces effectively. According to the diary, a core meeting of Maoists took place in September 2017, where they initiated drills to gain command, control, communication, and coordination skills. 
 
 The Reds also plan to destroy the information network of security forces. A month after the core meeting, a state military commission meeting took place. There was a plan to bring main forces to the Andhra-Odisha border area in 2018. 
 
 The Dandakaranya (DK) cadre are going to their camps as they said they have problems in dealing with other cadre. The source also claimed that the Maoists are planning to send a delegate to DK for sniper and booby trap training.
