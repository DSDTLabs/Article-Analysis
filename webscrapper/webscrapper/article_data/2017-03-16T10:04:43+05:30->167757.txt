MYSURU: In his last full-fledged budget as chief minister in this tenure,   has pitchforked Mysuru and neighbouring towns into a sharper focus. He has announced a purse of Rs 117 crore to develop roads and introduce 50 electric buses to further the city's image as a clean city. 

 But the city's civic mandarins are far from happy with these announcements. They had made a pitch for Rs 800 crore to develop the city, and they expected at least half the amount. All they have been allotted is nearly a seventh of the expected development corpus.
 
 Some of Mysuru's arterial roads are being upgraded and concretized. The CM has extended funds to develop 22 km of the roads in the city through a new purse of Rs 117 crore. At present, major parts of the 6km Dasara procession route are concretized. Some of the major stretches like   road are being four-laned. The Mysuru-Nanjangud road already has four tracks. Amid the Centre's efforts to promote Mysuru as a solar city,   has announced 50 electric buses that will help the city cut its carbon emission.
