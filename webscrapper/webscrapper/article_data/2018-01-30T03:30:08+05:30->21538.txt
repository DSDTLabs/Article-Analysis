 ‘Airpocalypse II: Assessment of   Pollution in Indian Cities’, a study conducted by the Greenpeace organization for 2015 and 2016, shows the air quality in the country is worsening. The particulate matter 10 data found that of the 25 cities surveyed in the state, none complied with the annual permissible concentration of 60-g/m³ (micrograms per cubic metre) prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board and the 20-g/m³ limit set by WHO in 2016.
 
 The study found the city’s annual average pollution levels in 2016 were 130-g/m³, up from 103-g/m³ the year before. While there are no prescribed limits for a monthly average, the city’s average of 213-g/m³ in December 2016 was the highest throughout the year. In the country, the city ranked the 51st most polluted city. None of the cities from the state were in the top 10 most polluted.
 
 “Apart from the monsoon months of June to September the pollution levels are higher than 100-g/m³ in Mumbai. During none of the months does the average meet the permissible limits. Cities like Mumbai should lead by example ... in being the cities where clean air, environment and health is prioritized over anything else to provide better quality of life for public,” said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India.
