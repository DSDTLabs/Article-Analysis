NEW DELHI: Law minister   has written to all the chief ministers seeking their cooperation in filling up vacancies in subordinate courts which has seriously dented the justice delivery system with more than 2.7 crore cases pending in lower courts across the country.

 There are 4,937 vacancies of judges in subordinate courts, the law minister has said in his latest communication to all chief ministers sent this week, highlighting the need to fill up vacancies in subordinate judiciary and district courts. 
 
 "Äs you are aware there are as many as 2.7 crore cases are pending in subordinate courts and 38.7 lakh cases in high courts,” the minister said in his letter, expressing concern on the huge  .
 
 Prasad said that he has already written to the chief justices of high courts, drawing their attention to the need for reducing pendency and speed up justice delivery by filling up of vacant posts in high courts and in subordinate courts under their jurisdiction.
 
 “Ï shall be grateful if you could extend your necessary support to the high court in their efforts to ensure faster implementation of the directions of the  ,” the minister has said.
 
 In view of the demand from the judiciary to increase the judge-population ratio in the country, the SC had in January directed the state governments to compute judge strength and to take necessary decisions within three months for enhancing the required judge strength accordingly. However, with huge vacancies, the priority remains to fill up the current positions.
 
 The 24 high courts across the country have more than 40% posts of judges vacant at present and has also resulted in pendency of cases. The apex court had earlier written to the chief justices to speed up filling up of vacancies in HCs to bring down pendency. It had also emphasised on disposing of all cases older than five years on priority.
