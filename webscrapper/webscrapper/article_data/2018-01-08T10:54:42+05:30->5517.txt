CHANDIGARH: The   administration has suggested changes in the plan prepared for conserving the building of Punjab and   high court, according to an officer who is in know of the development.

 The high court’s building falls in the UT Capitol Complex, a   site. The UT administration has asked the conservation architect to incorporate some drawings and other “relevant information” in the plan and asked the architect to consider the expenditure part in the plan. “Optimum use of space and minimum expenditure are the key aspects, which we have told the conservation architect about. We have also told the architect that there should not be any dismantling of the existing structure,” said the officer, who did not wish to be named.
 
 The conservation architect has to prepare the plan for conservation of all buildings at Capitol Complex, including the secretariat and the assemblies of Punjab and Haryana. “We have received some drawings of Punjab and Haryana secretariat; those have been approved. But, we have given observations regarding the high court conservation plan, as it needs more concern and changes,” the officer added.
 
 Issues related to the conservation plan were also discussed in detail at a recent meeting of the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee. Capitol Complex was declared a   World Heritage site on July 17 last year. This was a big achievement for the UT administration, which had made unsuccessful attempts to get the coveted tag since 2006. The complex was included in the transnational dossier on the works of   Corbusier, submitted by Paris-based Foundation   to UNESCO on behalf of seven countries, including France, Argentina, Japan, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany.
