HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad high court on Monday gave a day’s time to the Centre to make its stand clear on a petition seeking to make the President a party to the case pertaining to the case related to the suicide of Dalit scholar  . The President is the Visitor of the   and he alone has the powers under the varsity act to order probes into any alleged irregularities there.

 The bench of Justice V Ramasubramanian and Justice J Uma Devi told this to B Appa Rao, the counsel for the Centre, and posted the case to Tuesday. The case was filed by   MP V Hanumantha Rao, who was seeking the dismissal of the varsity’s vice chancellor P   for his irregular handling of the incidents that led to Rohith’s suicide. 
 
 Arguing the Congress leader’s case, his counsel C Damodar Reddy questioned the decision to allow the VC to rejoin his duties after he fled from the campus in the middle of a students’ revolt.
 
 The counsel reacted sharply when the Telangana state counsel described the case as politically motivated and based on ‘some incident somewhere in the campus’. He said that the state counsel has no role to play as they had not made any grievances against the state.
