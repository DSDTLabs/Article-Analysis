VISAKHAPATNAM: The Rs 570-crore hawala fraud is likely to be handed over to the CID or   as the police wing in Vizag does not have an economic offences wing to investigate the case, sources said. 

 The income tax department has reportedly approached the enforcement directorate (ED) for further investigation, the sources said.
 
 24- year-old   district had floated 13 shell companies and named his cousins of   area as directors. According to the sources, when his cousins were brought here by the cops, they admitted that Mahesh had taken their signatures for some business, but they claimed they were unaware of money laundering.
 
 IT officials were tracking the transactions of around 30 bank accounts since 2014 as huge amounts were transacted. “Around Rs 800 crore worth transactions took place from a single bank in Kolkata. Around Rs 92 crore cash transaction took place from a nationalised bank in   in Kolkata,” a senior police official of AP told TOI.
 
 The city cops reportedly submitted facts to DGP N   and informed him of the lack of machinery to investigate such economic offence cases. “The DGP may direct the CID to investigate or hand over it to the CBI,” a senior IPS officer at   said. If the case is handed over to the CID, then the economic offences wing headed by former city commissioner Amit Garg may lead the team, sources said.
