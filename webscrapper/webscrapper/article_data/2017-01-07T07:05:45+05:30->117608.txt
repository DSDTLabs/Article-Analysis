PUNE: A group of electric vehicle (EV) users set off from Pune to Nashik on Friday to spread awareness about EVs as a mode of   for a future without oil-based resources and pollution.

 The group is also promoting setting up of more charging stations for EVs on highways so they can undertake inter-city travel.
 
 At 10.30am, the rally ‘Re: Live 2017’, comprising five electric cars and four e-bicycles, took off from Chinchwad towards  . The group took breaks to charge the vehicles at Chakan and Narayangaon and halted at Sangamner for the night. All the three community charging points have been recently set-up where all EV owners can recharge the batteries for a cost.
 
 Similar groups of five and three EVs will take off from Mumbai and Ahmednagar to meet the Pune group on Sunday in Nashik. The rally has been organized by Pune-based PluginIndia, a resource of EV community charge points.
 
 According to Kamlesh Mullick from PluginIndia, the company has set up over 40 such points on the Mumbai-Pune, Pune-Mahabaleshwar, and Pune-Shirdi routes since 2015. An app called Re:ChargeIndia can be used to locate these as well as those installed by other companies. “Such points on the highways ease travelling to other cities in EVs,” he said.
 
 So far, only the National Capital Region (NCR) and Bengaluru have seen serious uptake of EVs. “With more such community charge points being set up around Pune and Mumbai, we are trying to popularise the use of these vehicles which are pollution-free and require no oil to run,” he added.
 
 Asked about the need for government support, Mullick said that while the government offers subsidy for setting up charging points, the process is quite slow.
