Ludhiana: After recommending action against colonisers, Ludhiana MC is going to catch hold of individual plot-holders who have not paid their dues since the regularization policy was announced in 2013.

 MC officials said there were roughly more than 2,000 plot-holders who had not cleared their dues and the MC would now serve notices to these plot-holders. Under the regularisation policy, MC had issued NOCs to around 36,000 plot-holders who cleared their dues and deposited all documents. But, like colonisers, some plot-holders did not clear their dues after depositing 25% of the amount to the department. 
 
 Sources in the MC revealed that officials had been told to prepare a list of such defaulters. “The amount they had deposited will be forfeited,” he said.
 
 At the time the government had announced the regularisation policy in previous years, plot holders came in large number whereas only a few colonizers came for clearing their dues. This is the reason plots inside colonies were regularized, but the colonies are still considered illegal. 
 
 MC assistant town planner (headquarter) S S Bindra said they have recommended FIR against individual colonizers, so that they should not be spared. He said colonizers had started approaching officials for getting them out of trouble, but now senior officials will take decision in this regard. 
 
 On Tuesday, some colonizers approached officials of the MC’s building branch for getting a solution to the problem. One of the officials informed that a colonizer even offered to pay Rs 1 crore to the MC, so that there should be no FIR against him. He said they have asked him to contact the MC commissioner in, because orders to get the FIR registered were issued by him. 
 
 The MC has already recommended FIR against 79 colonizers who did not clear their dues for regularisation of colonies. Along with this, MC had requested the DC for putting a ban on registries in these colonies.
