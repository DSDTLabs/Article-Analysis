MUMBAI: Following a Bombay high court rap last month over the municipal corporation favouring a private builder in an order in the   matter passed in July 2016, the municipal commissioner   on February 17 withdrew it and instead appointed an IAS level officer, the additional municipal commissioner (city), to hear the matter afresh and pass a speaking order.

 The order passed by the deputy municipal commissioner (improvements)   on July 14, 2016, would have forced the residents to pay penalties of Rs 50 crore for the various breaches to changing of the lessee in its records from   to M/s Krishna Developers. In the last week of January, the matter was heard in the Bombay high court, wherein a division bench of Justice   and Justice   expressed “shock” at the order by a deputy municipal commissioner they termed “prima facie illegal”.
 
 The petition was scheduled to be heard on March 6 but said that if the civic chief felt the order was illegal then he could order for the matter to be heard afresh.
