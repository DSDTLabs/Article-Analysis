PATNA: The state   this month departed from its traditional method of holding a state-level rally at the   in Patna as part of its mass mobilisation programme. Instead, its state functionaries fanned out in groups to different parts of the state to address local level rallies. 

 “The new method has rejuvenated the party’s local branches,” said party’s national council member  . 
 
 The party has units in all the districts. Although the state CPI leaders did not admit in as many words, it’s an old ‘market method’ to “go to them , if they don’t come to you”.
 
 “Earlier this year, there was a discussion on how best to rejuvenate our cadres in the field and how to reach out to potential supporters,” Alam said, adding it was decided to send out ‘jatthas’ (groups) to the “field”.
 
 “The response to the mass contact programme has been tremendous. We held unexpectedly big rallies in several districts,” Alam said, adding motorcycle-borne youths led the jattha to the rally venue everywhere and distributed handbills on way.
 
 A cluster of districts was put under the care of every ‘jattha’ which was tasked with addressing 70 meetings each. Seven such groups toured the state and addressed rallies for ten days from September 11 to 20. “Buoyed by the response, the party extended the programme by two days, and it ended on September 22,” Alam added.
 
 The CPI used to hold the post of leader of opposition in the 324-member assembly of combined   and   in the 1970s. However, its support base later started dwindling. From the 1990s onwards, the party has suffered the onslaught of what is popularly called ‘Mandal-Kamandal politics’.
