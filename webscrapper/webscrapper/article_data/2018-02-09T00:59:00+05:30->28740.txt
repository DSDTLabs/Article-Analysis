Karur: Reacting to former transport minister V Senthilbalaji’s allegations of mismanagement by the government that has resulted in the bus fare hike, transport minister M R Vijayabaskar on Wednesday hit out at the former for allegedly diverting funds meant for staff welfare toowards administrative expenses during his tenure and overburdening the corporation by overstaffing.  “The financial burden was caused by the recruitment of 38,000 more employees than the requirement by the previous transport minister who had left the 60,000 pensioners unpaid of their Rs 1,500 crore arrears and also diverted Rs 5,000 crore entitled to the employees welfare to run the corporation,” Vijayabaskar said while addressing reporters here.  Vijayabasker went on to say that transport corporation employees had got a minimum pay hike of Rs 1,350 and maximum of Rs 2,157 during the former’s tenure, the staff were given Rs 2,686 to Rs 11,361 pay hikes recently.  On the allegation against chief minister and ministers owning bus services, the transport minister retorted whether Senthilbalaji had indulged in such activities. “I have the details of buses procured by him,” said Vijayabaskar.  The issue over the location of the government medical college in Karur has been a bone of contention between Vijayabaskar and Senthilbalaji for the past couple of years. While the state government chose a place in the central part of Karur town, Senthilbalaji batted for a location in Vangal.  Justifying the government’s decision on the site, Vijayabaskar said, “ The location of the medical college would benefit all the people. He wanted to establish it in Vangal with vested interests.”  On his low-margin victory in Karur constituency in 2016, Vijayabaskar alleged that it was a conspiracy by Senthilbalaji with the DMK and the Congress that resulted in 441 votes difference.
