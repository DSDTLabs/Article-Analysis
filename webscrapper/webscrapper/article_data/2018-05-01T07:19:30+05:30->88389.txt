KOCHI: You would be surprised to know that the number of asthma patients in   are rising and many among them have no family history. The footfalls at chest and pulmonary departments in specialty hospitals have increased manifold, said pulmonologists. 

 So, on World Asthma Day doctors have a message for patients: 'Never too early, Never too late'. "Doctors of top super specialty hospitals in Kochi checked the number of patients arriving at chest and pulmonary departments during December-February period. The number was 65,000-70,000," said president,   and Critical Care Medicine ( ), Dr  .
 
  
  
 
 "During this period, there were 30,000 OP visits to pulmonology departments of 10 major Kochi hospitals. Around 35% were due to worsening of asthma; many of them kids and youths, said senior pulmonologist Dr Paramesh.
 
 A random screening of 6,920 people at 24 KSRTC depots in state, using a questionnaire and lung function tests, showed that 2,526 (36%) were asthmatics. "This is very high compared to previous surveys in India that quoted only 10-15%," said Dr Jacob Baby, senior pulmonologist at  , who coordinated the study.
 
 Of the lot, 1,493 didn't have a family history and maximum number of asthmatics were found in the age-group of 30-59. Baby said that high prevalence of asthmatics without family history is due to lifestyle changes, fast food culture, air pollution and emotional stress. "Also, 50% had reduced lung functions though the disease was under control. They were unaware about their condition and hence prone to severe asthma," he said. APCCM has launched a 'clean air' campaign to raise awareness among citizens on how pollution impacts health.
