Nagpur: Rural police have rescued 46 bovines arresting two persons and also seizing the truck in which the animals were being ferried towards city from Madhya Pradesh. The truck was seized by Katol police near Dharti-Murti Phata on Thursday.  The persons arrested have been identified as Jeetendra Aherwar (24) and Shaheed Khan (20), both natives of Madhya Pradesh, recovering bovines worth Rs 1.38 lakh. The truck, worth Rs9.38 lakh, too was being seized by the rural police. The animals were illegally ferried to slaughterhouse in city. Two coups were created in the truck for ferrying the animals separately in the cramped space leading to injuries to many bovines. Police said the starving animals were being ferried without being provided water and food for number of days.  Rural police have undertaken constant drives, under supervision of SP, rural, Shailesh Balkawade, against illegal ferrying of animals by the inter-state gangs. In the last week, several vehicles ferrying bovines have been intercepted rescuing the animals which were later shifted to different rehabilitation centres across the districts. The rural police have been aiming at curtailing the inter-state ferrying of the bovines with regular check-points on the highways. The latest action was led by sub-inspector Gajanan Telrandhe under PI Satishsingh Rajput of Katol police station following a tip-off. The case would be now investigated by Telrandhe.
