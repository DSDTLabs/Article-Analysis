CHENNAI: The state pollution control board is yet to give its nod for the India-based Neutrino project that is proposed to come up at   village in   taluk in   district. 

 A senior official from the TN pollution control board ( ) said that considering this as a special case, the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change had issued the environmental clearance for the project a couple of days ago. 
 
 The environmental clearance issued in 2011 was quashed by a court and so far no work has been initiated at the site, he said. Theni district environmental engineer will inspect the site to check whether the conditions laid down by the Union ministry are complied with or not by the project proponent. Once the official is satisfied, he will recommend it for clearance and only then the 'consent to establish' letter will be given to the project proponent.
 
 When asked about the time frame for issuing the clearance from the state PCB, the official said it will be difficult to specifically tell the time limit for issuing the certificate from the board side. Some works will be completed immediately, while some may take even months, he said. However, the official added that the project proponent has so far not submitted any application to the board for obtaining the clearance.
 
 Only last month the ministry had deferred the project stating that it wanted additional information with regard to geotechnical investigation report on a study for locating the underground laboratory at Pottipuram, status of court cases pending/disposed against the project and details about the public meeting held on July 8, 2010, by the district collector in which 1,200 Pottipuram residents took part.
