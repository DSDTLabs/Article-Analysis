There’s a hint of pride in his earthy voice, as  , discusses the triumph of young   and  , who sang the popular track   (' '). From the Manganiyar community, the talented teenagers won Upcoming Male Vocalists of The Year Award at the Radio Mirchi Awards this year. That, according to Khan, paves a way ahead for so many folk musicians from his community and encouraged them to dream and achieve.
As a singer, Khan’s voice captivates you, be it him singing Sufi chants, bhajans or rustic folk songs. The rhythmic claps from his khartal transport you and make you aware of the power of his voice. Khan, who has sung for films like Parched and Khap, says, “The songs that we sing are not mere tales. We preserve stories through our music. Us Manganiyars have come a long way. From singing in palaces of kings and in marriages, today, we have travelled around the world. We sing with artistes like Zubin Mehta and Zakir Hussain.” 
 While he is happy that Manganiyars are being recognised in some way, he has bigger hopes for his community. He states, “My one wish is that we should pay as much attention to folk music as we do to classical songs. It is a rich part of our heritage. It would be good if we can teach folk music in schools. It’s not just an art form, but is about history, and that’s something we cannot afford to lose.”
