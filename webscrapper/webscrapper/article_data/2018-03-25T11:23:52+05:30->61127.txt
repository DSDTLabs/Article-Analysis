 Gohil was found dead with injuries on his head on October 5 near a tomb on the banks of   where he used to perform religious ceremonies. During investigations police became suspicious of Rathwa’s involvement in the murder as he had been missing from village for no reason. On Friday, when he was held, Rathwa admitted of killing Gohil, the police said.
 
 Police said that on October 6 last year when Rathwa returning home from work, he saw that Gohil was involved in a scuffle with a mentally disturbed man. During interrogation Rathwa told the police that he asked Gohil to not fight with the man as he was mentally disturbed, but instead Gohil asked him to go away and threatened him with black magic.
 
 Angered by Gohil’s behaviour, Rathwa rammed his head with the tomb’s pillar due to which Gohil’s head started to bleed. Police said that Rathwa was afraid that Gohil will talk about the incident in the village and he will have to face the wrath of the villagers, so he took a wooden stick and killed Gohil.
