AMRITSAR: A jatha (group of pilgrims) of Thakur Dalip Singh-led faction of Namdhari Sikhs celebrated   at Ayodhya on Wednesday. “This is yet another revolutionary step taken by   who is of view that lord Rama is also sacred to Sikhs, and the initiative will help to forge more closer relations between Hindus and Sikhs,” spokesperson of Vishwa Namdhari Darbar Navtej Singh told TOI.

 He informed that Sikh ‘sangat’ (community) of Uttar Pradesh was camping in Ayodhya to celebrate Ram Navami. Navtej said soon they would jointly celebrate all Hindu festivals in Punjab too.
 
 Like baptised Sikhs, Namdharis also wear five kakars (articles of faith) and follow the maryada (religious code of conduct) of the tenth Sikh master  . Navtej said Sikhs were celebrating Ram Navami and Janam Ashthami since lord Rama and lord Krishna were also sacred as enshrined in Guru Granth Sahib and Bani of Bhai Gurdas.
 
 Quoting Dalip Singh, Navtej said a strong social fabric of nation would help to make India a stronger nation which was possible only if everyone lived in peace and perfect communal harmony. Earlier, in an attempt to bridge the gap with  , Thakur Dalip Singh had allowed Namdharis to wear a large kirpan.
