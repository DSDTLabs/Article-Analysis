TRICHY: Hundreds of villagers near   besieged the   district collectorate opposing the setting up of a sand   in   river as it would destroy the livelihood of the farming community in and around the village. The villagers also warned that they would hold a massive protest if the public works department (PWD) establishes the quarry.

 A large number of villagers from Vilangudi near   in the district, including women, approached the collectorâ€™s office in Thanjavur during the weekly grievance day meeting and submitted a petition to the collector A Annathurai demanding not to open any sand quarry in Kollidam riverbed.
 
 Hundreds of acres of fertile lands surround the spot where the authorities are preparing to set up a sand quarry, alleged the villagers. There is also a drinking water pumping station situated on the river 500m away from the spot, they added.
 
 Once the quarry starts operating, the available ground water levels in the area will deplete. Thousands of people will have drinking water issues during summer while in rainy season, the entire area would be inundated by flood water, alleged the villagers.
