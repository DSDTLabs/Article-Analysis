New Delhi: The Delhi high court has asked the CRPF chief to accept the surrender of one of its jawans who had run away from his battalion after slamming home minister   on the social media regarding the Sukma attack. 

 Justice Ashutosh  , in a late evening hearing on Thursday, also asked the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to deal with the jawan's case in accordance with law but "ensure no harm is caused to him."
 
  The order came on a letter written by the jawan to Delhi HC Chief Justice. The letter by Pankaj Kumar   which was treated as a petition, urged the court that he should be protected from harm after he surrenders. 
 
 Mishra, who claimed to have lost a relative in the Maoist attack at Sukma in  , had vented his frustration against the home minister in a Facebook video. The video had gone viral on the social media. Mishra, who was posted in the CRPF's 221 battalion stationed at Durgapur in  , had claimed in his letter that he ran away as he was being detained and feared for his life. The CRPF lodged a police complaint following his escape.
