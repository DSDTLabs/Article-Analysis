AHMEDABAD: Union minister of state (MoS) for agriculture & farmer’s welfare, and   MP from Gujarat, Parshottam Rupala, claimed on Wednesday the Narmada dam gates will be closed late this year, and it will help the state to double its farm produce.

 Rupala, who handles the ministry for panchayati raj, said that Gujarat has shown the way to the nation in bringing ‘Operation Flood’ the milk revolution which was started by   (NDDB) in 1970s. He stressed there is a need to bring a similar revolution in the food processing industry.
 
 “I believe the work of Narmada dam gates will be completed by December 2017. The last phase of the canal work will begin by February or March. We just need to get sanction of four states,” said Rupala.
 
 “If we can fulfil this dream, then we can implement the idea of ‘per drop one crop’ and agriculture production will be doubled,” Rupala said while speaking in a seminar on ‘Enhancing Agriculture Growth through Food Processing’ in Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit-2017. 
 
 Rupala further claimed that the water of Sabarmati river, which people of Ahmedabad used for drinking water earlier, can now be made available for irrigation.
