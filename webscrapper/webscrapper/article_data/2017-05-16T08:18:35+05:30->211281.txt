Sindhis who crossed over from Pakistan after Partition and have been living in   camps in various parts of the state for decades can now hope for better settlements. The state government last week reviewed the plan for redevelopment of these colonies. 

 The   will first be taken up in Mumbai.
 
 Though the residents were given occupancy rights of these settlements, which are on government land, the owner ship of the land remains with the Centre. The state government has been looking after maintenance of these colonies since 1971. 
 
 The state government has identified 31 refugee camps for redevelopment. The government said there were nearly 30 lakh   migrants who had fled Pakistan post-Partition to settle in camps across the country.
 
 These migrants have been living in refugee camps for 70 years. Revenue department officials said the initial proposal was to   the settlements in Mulund, Sion Koliwada, Kurla and Chembur, all spread over 280 acres, followed by the one in Pimpri   near Pune.
 
 Residents will have to partly pay for the redevelopment as per the Ready Reckoner rate, an official said. 
 
 “It is either 25% or 12.5% of the ready reckoner rate depending on the area,” the official said.
 
 The state has started giving ownership rights of units to families, but sources said the benefit had not been extended to all families.
