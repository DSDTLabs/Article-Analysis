GUWAHATI: While the Kamrup (Metro) administration and the   (GMC) do their best to make the city a 'smart' one, finding public transport in the evening remains a big hassle. 

 "For anyone travelling within the city, it is very difficult to get around after 9pm. There are no city buses or other means of public transport. Not all people can afford cabs or auto rickshaws. Even the city buses that do ply the roads in the evening are overcrowded after 6pm. It is especially difficult for older people or women to travel under these circumstances," said  , a retired school teacher who often uses public transport.
 
 "Transportation has always been a problem. We don't need buses till midnight. Even having them around till 10pm would help," said Rita Das, who works at a shopping mall in the city.
 
 It's not that civic authorities have not paid attention to the problem. The regional transport authority ( ) had started a bus service, for instance, but it failed to take off. In 2015, the Kamrup (Metro) district administration had started an evening city bus service on an experimental basis on three routes. The buses would ply the roads till midnight. The service also gained support from the city bus owners' association.
 
 "Unfortunately, public response was inadequate. So, it didn't work," said deputy commissioner M Angamuthu, who also happens to be the chairman of RTA. "Perhaps it is time to revamp the existing model and identify better alternatives. We will examine what can be done at the earliest through RTA," he added.
 
 At present, around 250 buses under the   ply the city roads, all of which are in good condition, which should be adequate. There are also 1,159 trekkers and more than 1,000 city buses that are registered with the district transport office of Kamrup (Metro) transport office. This does not, however, seem to have translated to better services for the public yet.
