NOIDA/BEIJING: Production at   Oppo’s Noida plant was halted on Wednesday as tension prevailed amid protests by its workers and locals after a company employee, a Chinese national, allegedly tore the national flag and threw it in a dustbin. 

 Oppo officials said the “situation will be assessed” on Thursday and added that no decision has as yet been taken on restarting production.
 
 The company, expressing regret over the incident, said it had deep respect for India and its people. “We at Oppo India would like to restate our deep respect for India and the people here. Since our establishment in India, Oppo has been committed to the development of the industry and local communities. Our priority is the well-being of our employees and the community we service,” it said in a statement.
 
 The mobile maker also said that after an inquiry with the concerned authorities, it found that “a worker had discarded the Indian flag from the table during regular external material check.”
 
 “Oppo India regrets this unfortunate incident and reaffirms that this is an individual’s behaviour that in no way represents our company’s position. We have zero tolerance for such matters and have taken strict action in terminating the individual and continue working very closely with the authorities on the matter,” its statement said.
 
 Meanwhile, reacting to reports of investigation into the incident, China’s foreign ministry has expressed hope that “legitimate rights” of its companies and citizens are respected during the ongoing probe. 
 
 “We have seen the [media] report. As far as we know, the company is in touch with the local police. We hope this issue can be resolved properly,” Lu Kang, foreign ministry spokesperson said in Beijing.
