PATIALA: The All-India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF) has decided to hold a national convention of electricity employees and engineers from across the country at New Delhi against the enactment of Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2014 on June 8, alleging exploitation of power sector workers under the grab of new amendment.

 Power sector engineers and employees are opposed to the bifurcation of wire and content and privatisation of power sector through multiple licensees.
 
 V K Gupta, spokesperson of AIPEF, said the Electricity Act 2003 made a concurrent subject more central government-centric, thus curtailing the powers of state governments. “Regulation is through an independent regulator bypassing the government and the legislator on a subject, so vital to every citizen but experience has shown that the regulators, far from being independent, are regulated by vested interests,” he said.
