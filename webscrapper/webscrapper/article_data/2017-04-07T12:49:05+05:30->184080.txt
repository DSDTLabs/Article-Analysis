NEW DELHI: Setting aside protocol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today went to the IGI airport here to receive his Bangladeshi counterpart  .

 The Prime Minister travelled through normal traffic without any route restrictions, official sources said.
 
 The Bangladesh Prime Minister is on a four-day visit to India, which comes after a gap of seven years.
 
 Hasina will hold wide-ranging talks with Modi tomorrow during which India is also set to announce a line of credit of USD 500 million to Bangladesh for military supplies.
 
 She will also call on President Pranab Mukherjee and meet opposition leader Sonia Gandhi. She will visit Ajmer on Sunday and will meet Indian business leaders on Monday.
 
 She will also join a function at Manekshaw Centre to honour Indian Armed Forces members who embraced martyrdom in Bangladesh's War of Liberation in 1971.
 
 Diplomatic quarters of both sides expect that the reciprocal visit of the Bangladesh premier would take the Dhaka-New Delhi "historic relations" to a new height, unveiling newer dimensions of cooperation in various sectors including trade and commerce, economy and connectivity.
