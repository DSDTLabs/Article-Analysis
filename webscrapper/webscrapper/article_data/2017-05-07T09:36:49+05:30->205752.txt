PUNE: Uruli Devachi and   villagers on Saturday said they were unwilling to hold talks with the government till the civic body and the state promise in writing that the garbage depot in the village limits will be shut down forever. 

 Though leaders from  , Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress and other political parties continued to pour into Uruli Devachi and Phursungi, the villagers decided not to speak to anyone on Saturday. Agitating villagers tied black ribbons on their mouths and refused to hold talks.
 
 State minister Vijay Shivtare, Pune municipal commissioner   and other leaders visited villagers, who alleged that chief minister   has not kept his word to resolve the garbage issue. "The CM had said that within nine months he will solve the problem. Now, he is saying he never gave such a promise. What is the guarantee that the government will keep the word given this time?" the agitating villagers asked.
 
 Members of the village committee said the agitation will continue till May 12. After that, a further decision will be taken. The committee told the visiting leaders that the villagers would not let PMC dump garbage there at any cost. 
 
 While the state government has asked municipal commissioner, the district collector and ministers to hold a combined meeting to discuss solutions to the problem, villagers said they were not interested. 
 
 Fadnavis will be in the city on Sunday to attend private functions. BJP leaders in the PMC are trying to convince the villagers to meet Fadnavis and discuss the matter.
 
 "We don't want to get into any political trap but want an immediate solution to this two-decade-old problem. Villagers are in no mood to withdraw their agitation," Dilip Mehta, who was representing the villagers, said.
