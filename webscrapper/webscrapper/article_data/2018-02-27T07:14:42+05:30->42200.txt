LUCKNOW: In spite of the ban on use of loudspeakers between 10pm and 6am, they continue creating noise at religious places and weddings after the deadline due to slackness on part of district administration in implementing the ban. 

 In December 2017, the   had directed the state government to remove all unauthorised loudspeakers. But district administration has failed to enforce the order as residents complain of no let up in noise and say that complaints have fallen on deaf ears.
 
 People living near ceremonial and religious places have been continuously complaining against noise pollution. Most complainants told TOI that they reported about noise pollution on UP 100 but it proved futile. 
 
 "I dialled 100 thrice to take police help against unauthorised use of   in a nearby mosque. But no action was taken," said Ayush, a resident of Pulgama, Chowk.
 
 "My children are not able to study because of loudspeakers in a temple nearby. I complained, but police officials asked me to cooperate," said Javed, a resident of Darulshafa, whose kids are appearing in UP board exams.
 
 The high court had recently rapped the state government for failing to curb noise pollution despite specific directives in this regard. It asked why government can't impose blanket ban on use of loudspeakers as it had done on use of beacon lights.
 
 "Since December 20, over 2,300 notices were served to religious places and 1,000 to wedding venues. Nearly 2,000 religious places took permission for loudspeaker use," said   west Santosh Kumar Vaish. Additional city magistrate   said, "Mostly people file complaint against religious places, but when police officials visit the spot they find that they are being use with due permission." 
 
 When TOI contacted owners of wedding venues, they said that they always take permission.
