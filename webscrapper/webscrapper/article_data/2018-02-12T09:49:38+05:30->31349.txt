HYDERABAD: People in the city breathe a lot of poisonous air, thanks to severe traffic congestion—shows data available with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ( ).

 According to statistics, the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 levels at monitoring stations located at Hyderabad   and Nehru Zoological Park are well above permissible limits.
 
 The PM 10 reading for   and Central University for Sunday stood at 108 µg/m3 and 75 µg/m3, respectively, as against the permissible limit of 60 µg/m3 prescribed by   (CPCB). At industrial areas such as Bollaram and Pashymylaram, the presence of particulate matter was much higher. At Bollaram PM 10 reading was 99 µg/m3 on Sunday.
 
  
  
 Experts attribute the increased presence of particulate matter in the air primarily to traffic congestion. “At several places, vehicular pollution was the primary cause of rising number of pollutants recorded in the air. In addition, unauthorized construction activity also caused considerable pollution,” said P Veeranna, senior scientist with TSPCB.
 
 The level of other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (Nox) has also gone up. While the normally recorded 24-hour average of SO2 stands at 4.4 ug/m3, the same figure at Zoo park stood at 9.5 ug/m3, on Sunday. Nox levels stood at 37.10 ug/m3— higher than the daily average of 30 ug/m3. SO2 level recorded at the Patancheru monitoring station stood at an alarming 31.00 ug/m3, on Sunday.
 
 Pulmonologists say they’ve seen a rise in the number of people detected with  , a disease primarily associated with polluted air.
