NAGPUR: The decision to scale up fares by introducing tatkal and more charges for early bookings has failed to make any negative impact on tourism in   ( ).

 The new fare regime came into force from February 1, 2018 wherein Rs4,000 are being charged for online bookings between 60-120 days and on weekends the same costs Rs8,000. Besides, newly introduced tatkal booking costs Rs4,000, though there is no fare hike (Rs1,000) for bookings done within 60 days and on weekends (Rs2,000).
 
 When introduced, there was hue and cry by resort owners, guides and tourists themselves, who apprehended that the new fares would hit tourism hard. However, figures show that   became richer even after the fare hike.
 
 Figures procured under RTI Act show that from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 (one year period), Tadoba recorded a revenue of little over Rs3.31 crore through 30,113 bookings.
 
 On the contrary, from July 1, 2017 till April 8, 2018 (10 months), the park earned a total revenue of Rs4.52 crore from 28,222 online bookings.
 
 “We still have two months of peak tourism season to go. The revenue and bookings will certainly go up further,” says chief conservator and field director Mukul Trivedi.
 
 Surprisingly, the figures show that after allowing bookings from January 9, 2018, the park earned a revenue of Rs3.03 crore from 14,145 bookings between January 9 to April 8, 2018. During the same period in 2017, the park had earned a revenue of Rs1.06 crore through 9,589 bookings.
 
 “This comparison itself shows that the new changes have not hit either revenue or tourism,” said Trivedi.
 
 The RTI reply also reveals that out of the 14,145 bookings, which were done after January 9, 2018, 3,624 bookings (25%) were beyond 60-120 days for which fare was increased to Rs4,000 (normal week days) and Rs8,000 (weekends and holidays).
 
 Of the total revenue of Rs4.52 crore, the park earned a revenue of Rs1.82 crore from bookings beyond 60-120 days. The park also earned a revenue of Rs26.29 lakh from 650 tatkal bookings.
 
 Despite increase in revenue and tightening screws against violators, a section of resort owners, guides and Gypsy drivers met forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on April 13 in Chandrapur complaining that tourists inflow has been reduced in Tadoba due to increase in the fares and reduction of carrying capacity.
 
 “However, the figures speak for itself. Despite changes in fare system and carrying capacity going down, revenue of the park and number of tourists have not decreased,” said TATR officials.
 
 “For example, in February-March 2017, the number of tourists visiting Tadoba was 31,656, while during the same period in 2018, the figure was 31,545, which means a loss of 111 tourists, which hardly matters. This is because of reduction in carrying capacity and not due to fare changes,” says Trivedi.
