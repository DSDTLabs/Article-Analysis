JAIPUR: Gone are the days when   (Uttar Pradesh) and Moradabad (Uttar Pradesh) were sending  . Affected by fog which delays their supplies, this year the kite manufacturers of   have sent their labourers in advance in the areas including Handipura, Bassi and Kanota to make and sell kites. 

 Kites from Bareilly and Moradabad are alsway in great demand since these kites are better than the ones made in the local market - in terms of paper, size and the stick used. Thus, in order to cater to maximum people in a competitive market the kite makers can now be seen in Jaipur and its outskirts.
 
 "Earlier if we used to order kites from them and the supply used to come every week. But from this year kite-makers of Uttar Pradesh are asking us to get kites from areas including Handipura, Bassi and Kanota-situated manufacturing units," said  , a Jhotwara-based kite manufacturer.
 
 This change has adversely affected the local market. "Earlier there used to be a scarcity of kites from Bareilly and Moradabad. Since they have decided to manufacture kites through rented houses and godowns it has become easier to get these kites in abundance. It has also given us scope to earn better," said Naeem Khan, a Handipura-based kite-maker in Jaipur.
 
 Kites of different shapes and sizes from Uttar Pradesh are easily available everywhere in the city. "The price of kites from Bareilly and Moradabad varies between Rs 100 per 20 pieces and Rs 180 per 20 pieces. The best thing about these kites is that even the smaller kites fly high, "said Khan.
 
 Meanwhile, the festival fervour is catching up in Jaipur markets. "Since just a week is left for Makar Sakranti festival, people are now coming to get the best lot of kites and manjha," said Ramesh Agarwal, a Tripolia Bazaar-based wholesale dealer of kites.
