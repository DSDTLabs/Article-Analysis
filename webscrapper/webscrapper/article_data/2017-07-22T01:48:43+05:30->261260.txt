NEW DELHI: For the last one and a half years, commuters, especially those from  , have been braving a bumpy ride due to the pathetic condition of Sarita   flyover. 

 While the road is riddled with potholes, the bitumen   in several places on the surface of the flyover had been eroded away.
 
 Ravi, a Noida resident and an executive with an MNC in Gurgaon, takes this route daily to work. To avoid the peak hour traffic jam at RTR flyover and Ring Road, he drives to Noida via Badarpur. “The route saves a lot of time, but driving on this flyover is a nightmare. The entire stretch has become accident-prone as vehicles abruptly stop or slow down to avoid the potholes. It is more dangerous for bikers as they can lose their balance,” he said.
 
 The carriageway going towards Apollo Hospital is so badly damaged that Noida-bound vehicles stay on the right side of the carriageway and abruptly turn left towards the arm of the flyover leading to GD Birla Marg.
 
 Residents of   Vihar blame PWD for the poor maintenance of roads. Dr SK Awana, president of H-Block market, said that the flyover has been in this condition for the past one and a half years. “The least PWD can do is fill the potholes so that the road is motorable. No efforts have been made to address the problem and traffic jams are common on this stretch as vehicles slow down to negotiate the potholes,” he said.
 
 Manju Sharma, a resident of Sarita Vihar, said that while the stretches before and after the flyover have been repaired, no work has been done to address the problem on the  . “It is extremely dangerous as autorickshaws and other vehicles turn suddenly to avoid the potholes. We are at risk as we have to use this flyover to enter our society, especially during night,” said the senior citizen.
 
 A PWD official said, “We have awarded the tender for repair of the flyover and work will start soon.”
