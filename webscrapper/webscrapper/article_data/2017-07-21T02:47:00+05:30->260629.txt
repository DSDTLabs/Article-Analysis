Nagpur: The state government has constituted a five-member committee to expedite biodiversity park and watershed development works in Ambazari reserve forest spread in 1,854 acres.

 The committee consists of Nagpur municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal, chief conservator of forest (CCF) Sanjeev Gaur, CCF & Melghat field director MS Reddy, corporator Parinita Fuke, and NGO Jaydeep Das.
 
 The committee has been set up after representation by MLC Parinay Fuke on June 22 to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis over slow pace of work on biodiversity park.
 
 Interestingly, the letter to set up the committee was received a day ago and the committee has been asked to submit progress report by July 25.
 
 The government wants to spend Rs27-crore on biodiversity park in Ambazari. However, the project will need clearance under Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 as there will be many non-forestry activities.
