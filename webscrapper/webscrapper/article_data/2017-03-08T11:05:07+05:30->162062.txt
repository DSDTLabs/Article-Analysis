CHENNAI: Former chief minister   will soon vacate 'Thenpennai', his official residence on   and move to a rented house on Sriman Srinivasa Road, Alwarpet.

 His official residence had been the hub of political activity following his rebellion against party general secretary V K Sasikala on February 7. The leader had planned his rebellion here along with his supporter-MLAs and MPs, and the place continued to be the faction's war room.
 
 The state government issued a notice to OPS asking him to vacate the Greenways residence after he ceased to be chief minister. “Panneerselvam, along with his family members, visited the house in Alwarpet on Tuesday and agreed to take it on rent. He will move into the new place with his family soon,” said a leader of the OPS faction. 
 
 Preparations have begun. Panneerselvam’s pet dogs and a jallikattu bull gifted by his supporters may move with him. “The bull and dogs have been his companion for a long time, and he may not let them go,” said the leader. 
 
 “The new house is not as big as Thenpennai, but we cannot expect such a big house in the city when he is not a minister. Only closed door meetings will be held in the new house. We will find an office space soon to hold meetings with cadres and interactions with reporters. But, this is yet to be decided,” said the leader.
 
 Soon after the   government won the vote of confidence, OPS loyalists, who had gathered at his Greenways Road residence were attacked by supporters of state law minister C Ve Shanmugam. An OPS supporter and a policeman were injured in the attack. “The new house is in the prime locality and close to   too,” said the OPS faction leader.
