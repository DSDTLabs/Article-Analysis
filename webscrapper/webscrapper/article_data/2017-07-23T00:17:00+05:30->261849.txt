Ludhiana: A local court has acquitted Harminder Singh, who along with a few others, was booked by Raikot police in a case of explosives recovery. The court of additional sessions judge Anjana acquitted Harminder Singh in the case for want of evidence. He has also been an accused in the Shingar blast case, and was later acquitted.

 On June 29, 2009, Harminder Singh and three other accused were booked by Raikot police under the Explosive Substance Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and waging a war against the nation. Counsel for Harminder Singh, Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, said Balbir Singh along with two other accused persons were sentenced to five years imprisonment as explosives were found in their car, and Harminder Singh was declared a proclaimed offender in the case for conspiring a bomb blast. He added that Harminder Singh was arrested by the police in 2010, and was released on bail in 2015.
 
 The defence counsel referring to the courtâ€™s order said Harminder Singh was acquitted in the case, as the court did not find any incriminating evidence against him related to charges levelled by the prosecution. He added that Harminder Singh was earlier acquitted in the Shingar Cinema, Ambala and Patiala bomb blast cases, and RDX recovery cases in Mohali, Nawanshahar, and Ludhiana.
