Vadodara: After the recent drunken fracas at the Halls of Residence, M S University has now removed Ajay Dogra as technical supervisor, a post which he was holding for the last two years. 

 It was on Friday last that Dogra, the warden of Rabindranath Tagore Hall of Halls of Residence and vice-chancellor (VC) nominee in the university’s senate body after getting drunk had created a major ruckus at the boys hostel. Dogra, who was arrested by Fatehgunj police on wee hours of Friday morning under Prohibition Act and for criminal assault on a student, was later suspended by MSU officials from the post of warden while his senate membership was also ceased. 
 
 However, questions were being raised on his appointment as technical supervisor – the post which earned him additional Rs 6,000 per month despite having no expertise in civil engineering. It is alleged that Dogra, who was appointed as a curator at the laboratory of civil engineering department of Polytechnic College, had bagged the post of technical supervisor because of his closeness to a syndicate member from the ruling saffron brigade of the campus. 
 
 It was thanks to his proximity with the syndicate member that he was first appointed as warden of the boys’ hostel and later as VC’s nominee in the university’s highest body.
