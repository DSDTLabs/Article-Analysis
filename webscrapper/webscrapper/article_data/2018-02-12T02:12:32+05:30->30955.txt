NOIDA: A week after gym trainer Jitendra Yadav (25) was shot at in Parthala village in Noida by a trainee sub-inspector, a one-minute   showing the   questioning him has surfaced. 

 The video is apparently recorded by a policeman on his mobile phone minutes before the shooting on February 3 night.
 
 The video shows the cops questioning three persons — Jitendra and his friends Suneel Jat and Gautam — standing outside a Mahindra Scorpio in Parthala village. Jitendra is seen wearing a maroon and green T-shirt and trousers and some liquor bottles, a plastic glass filled with alcohol, water and snacks can be seen inside the vehicle.
 
 The police personnel start searching the vehicle and ask Jitendra his father’s name, to which he replies that he belongs to Lokpal Pradhan’s family. The gym trainer says “yes” when asked if Dharmendra Yadav is his brother. Jitendra’s friend Suneel is seen standing next to him with an earphone plugged in, while Gautam is nearby wearing a white shirt and trousers.
 
 A police officer can be heard saying: “He is Dharmendra’s brother. There won’t be an issue.” The video abruptly ends in the melee. Jitendra and his two friends looked fine and there was no injury till the time the video ends. The video does not capture any resistance from any side.
 
 Noida police have maintained that Jitendra was shot at by mistake while the cops were trying to take them to the police station. He had allegedly refused to accompany the cops.
 
 Umesh Yadav, Jitendra’s cousin, said he could not vouch for the authenticity of the video. “However, the policemen are seen questioning Jitendra. It becomes clear that they had identified him and shot at him in cold blood. All the police personnel should be held for this shootout,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Jitendra has been shifted from the ICU to the general ward at Fortis Hospital after his health condition imporved. Sources said he could now communicate and move his hands.
