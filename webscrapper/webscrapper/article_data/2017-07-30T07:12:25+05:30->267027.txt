Spread happiness through   and give every deserving artiste the recognition he/she deserves — that has always been the motto of Radhika Mukherji’s  . 

 She says, “What started off as a dream in 2016 has now become a force to reckon with. Within one year, we have successfully signed up with 600+ artistes and executed 376 gigs."
 
 She adds, "While everybody likes growing numbers, we love the fact that we served as a platform for hundreds of artistes. While we were not surprised to see the amount of talent our country produces, what astonished us was the demand for new talent.”
 
  
  
  This year, the company’s aim is to gather audiences for the performers and nurture their talent. Happydemic is also looking at launching their own set of artistes, who will be mentored by industry experts. They’ll not only be taught singing, but also given a crash course on the tricks of the trade.
 
 “We are looking at giving them a digital push by forging associations with digital platforms and streaming their performances for a larger set of audiences,” signs off Radhika.
