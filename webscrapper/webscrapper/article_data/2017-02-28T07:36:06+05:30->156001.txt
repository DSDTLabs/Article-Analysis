BENGALURU:   MLC Lahar   will meet home minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday to request him to expedite probe into his complaint against the state   unit for producing a diary, which he claims, does not belong to him. 

  The diary has details of alleged pay-offs to his party's central leadership. 
 
  KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao had released the diary to the media on Saturday. 
 
  Siroya told TOI that even as he sought for a   inquiry into the issue, he wanted the local police to investigate and submit a report at the earliest. Reiterating that the signature in the diary was not his, Siroya said this could be verified with several documents he had signed at the legislative council secretariat to claim his reimbursements. 
 
  "This fake diary has done more damage to the Congress than to me or the BJP," Lahar Singh added. 
 
  "The Congress wanted something to counter  's diary. While trying to do this, they didn't seem to have got the supposed diary verified by the home department which is headed by G Parameshwara. This shows there's no coordination between Parameshwara and Dinesh Gundu Rao who released the diary," Siroya claimed. 
 
 `Diary a fabrication'
 
 Reacting to Gundu Rao's allegations, BJP spokesperson, and MLC Ashwathnarayan had argued that the word, Namo had not been coined at the time when the diary was seized. “Narendra Modi was not the Prime Minister when the raid in question took place, and the diary was allegedly seized. He assumed the office of the PM in 2014.Also, Namo, as a word had not been coined then. How can there be a diary with his name?“ he had asked.
 
 Claiming that the diary was a fabrication, he had also pointed out that Amit Shah and P Muralidhar Rao were not part of the national leadership in 2013.
