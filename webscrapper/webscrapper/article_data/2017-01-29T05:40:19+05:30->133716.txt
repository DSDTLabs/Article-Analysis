CHENNAI: Quashing the appeal from a man convicted of rape by a trial court, the   on Saturday reconfirmed the sentence of life imprisonment against him and his three associates. The court also announced a compensation of Rs8 lakh to the   survivor.

 The atrocities of the four had reduced the final year college student into a “rubber doll”. Wondering whether “we should bow our heads in shame”, the court made it clear that the lifer awarded to all four rapists would mean imprisonment for the remainder of the natural life. “They shall not be remitted by the government under any reason,” said the division bench comprising Justice S Nagamuthu and  .
 
 The girl had stepped out of the car in which she was travelling with her boyfriend to answer nature’s call, when the rapists accosted her and dragged her into the bushes. Her friend was assaulted as well and tied up. The rapists also filmed the incident, which occured in  , on a cellphone and threatened that they would upload the footage online, if the girl disclosed the incident to anyone. The incident came to light after a cattle grazer found the girl and informed villagers. The judges viewed the recording and said: “This evidence would conclusively go to prove the guilt of these four accused.” 
 
 The judges said the trial court had not considered the compensation aspect, but it would not deter the high court bench from ordering ‘appropriate compensation’. Noting the monetary relief was an attempt to ease her sufferings the judges said, “The facts of this case illustrates that even after 69 years of Independence, we are not in a position to ensure the safety and modesty of a young girl.”
 
 Though the Victim Compensation Scheme provided for payment of a maximum of Rs 3 lakh, the judges said given the facts of the case, they had decided to direct the government to pay Rs8 lakh to the gang-rape survivor.
