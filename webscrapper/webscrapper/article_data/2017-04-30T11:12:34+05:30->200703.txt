THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   in the state have started working out plans to avoid   over the state government decision that all schools in the state should compulsorily teach Malayalam up to Class X. 

 As part of this, Kerala CBSE school managements' association has submitted representations to union HRD minister   and CBSE, seeking their intervention to maintain status quo in teaching Malayalam in CBSE-affiliated schools in the state. 
 
 The state executive meeting of the association would on Sunday discuss the future course of action with regard to the implementation of the government ordinance that declared Malayalam studies compulsory up to Class X. Sources said the managements' association may explore legal options to nullify the government decision to impose restrictions on schools, students and their parents over the choice of language studies.
 
 Meanwhile, the Malappuram chapter of Sahodaya school complex, association of CBSE-affiliated schools, called on governor   here on Saturday to seek his intervention to ensure that the compulsory study of Malayalam is implemented only in a phased manner. The association said it would be unfair to insist that even those who did not study Malayalam till Class IX should study the language in Class X.
