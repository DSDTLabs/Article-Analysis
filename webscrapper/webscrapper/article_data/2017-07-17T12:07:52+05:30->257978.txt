INDORE:   Medical College sought the state government’s help to gain possession of land to develop a 10-storey building to house 220 of its doctors.

 “We have written to the principal secretary Gauri Singh to intervene in freeing encroachments on 2.24 acres behind Kalyanmal Nursing Home (KNH) in Old Palasia,” college spokesperson Dr Rahul Rokade told TOI.
 
 He added the plot is part of 8.24 acres of the college’s property which was provided to KNH.
 
 “There are some encroachments and a private school has claimed ownership. We have necessary documents to establish the land belongs to us and we require it for a plan to expand the college,” Dr Rokade said.
 
 He added construction work will start by the end of this year.
 
 “We are going to put the issue forward at the college’s executive committee meeting to be held in a fortnight,” Dr Rokade said.
 
 He added the health department has contemplated shifting KNH to MTH Hospital.
 
 “The deadline to complete MTH Hospital’s new building has been set for April, 2018. Once completed, KNH will be shifted. There are plans to use KNH’s land to develop a new medical facility,” Dr Rokade said.
 
 The college administration has also approached the principal secretary regarding removing structures erected by the National Cadet Corps (NCC) on its land behind Cancer Hospital.
 
 “We require the land for a proposed super-specialty hospital and have approached the principal secretary. Her reply in both matters is awaited,” Dr Rokade said.
