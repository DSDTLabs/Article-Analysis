PHULPUR (Allahabad): Chief minister   on Sunday sidestepped any threat from the   between state’s two big regional players, SP and  , by describing it as an un-natural relation.

 “Kahu Rahim kaise nibhe, ber ker ko sang. Arthath kela aur ber ek saath nahi khaaye jaate(A banana and Indian Jujube never go together),” Yogi told a gathering in Allahabad. He was here to campaign for poll-bound   seat that will see elections on March 11.
 
 He also told the gathering that he made specific instructions to ensure long Holi celebrations despite the festival coinciding with Friday prayers.
 
 “Aapne dekha hoga pehli baar hua hai ki Holi aur Juma ek saath pad gaya. Log poochte the kaise hoga. Juma saal mein 52 baar aaata hai. Holi kewal 1 baar. Humne kaha Holi hogi aur Holi ka pura samman hona chahiye. Aur dekhiye Holi ka tyauhar kaise manaya gaya (You must have observed that this happened for the first time that Holi and Friday prayers fell on the same day. But I told people that Friday prayers happen 52 times a year while Holi comes only once a year. I said Holi will be given its due respect and you saw how Holi was celebrated across UP),” said Yogi.
 
 
 He was though to quick to express gratitude to Muslims for having deferred Friday afternoon prayers by at least two hours. Out of nearly 13 lakh registered voters, Phulpur has nearly 3 lakh Muslims while the significant population is that of Brahmins and Patels (OBCs), each at 4 lakh.
 
 Incidentally, both Yogi and deputy CM  , who was accompanying him at Phulpur rallies, sought support from Dalits.
 
 “Our party’s motto has been ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. Being an OBC, I was made party president, I fought here and I got the support of Brahmins, Dalits, and Patels and all members of other communities as well. I seek the support of Dalit community yet again to ensure the success of BJP candidate,” Maurya told the gathering in Nawabganj.
 
 Like 2014, the BJP has fielded OBC candidate Kushalendra Singh Patel in Phulpur.
