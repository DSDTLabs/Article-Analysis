 and facial fuzz seem to have become best buddies. After ' ', the actor has grown a beard and a moustache for his upcoming period drama, too. Buzz is that he also grew a beard for three months for his look in ' ', which was eventually changed. When BT met him recently and asked him if his wife   was tired of all the facial hair, Shahid said, “While prepping for 'Rangoon', we contemplated making my character a Sikh soldier. I grew a beard, but we decided against styling Nawab Malik that way. I grew a beard for three-and-a-half months for nothing, when Mira and I were on our honeymoon. It’s not easy being an actor’s wife and she is pretty sweet and accommodating that way.”
