KOLKATA: Indian pacer Mohammad Shami’s wife   met chief minister   in the assembly around 2.45pm on Friday.

 Jahan, who accused her husband of domestic violence and extra marital affairs, wanted ‘emotional support’ from the chief minister. Jahan had come to the assembly when the Rajya Sabha election was on.
 
 She went to the chief minister’s room and stayed there for 15 minutes. After the meeting, Jahan said: “The chief minister was kind and empathetic towards my struggle. She has assured me of all support”.
 
 The meeting comes a day after the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) recommended to the Board of Control for Cricket in India(   ) to include the Bengal pacer in the list of centrally contracted players from which he was left out following Jahan's accusations that he was involved in match-fixing.
 
 Jahan also alleged that Shami was spending time with a Pakistani woman in Dubai and taking money from her. Shami was also probed by the anti-corruption officials of the BCCI for allegedly taking money from Pakistani contacts and was not found guilty. Kolkata police is however investigating the case of domestic violence registered by Hasin against Shami and four others on March 8.
