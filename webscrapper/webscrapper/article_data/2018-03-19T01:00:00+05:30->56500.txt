 Says Abhinav Shuklaa, “Aapla Manus is our first production and we are thrilled with its success. The film was loved by many because of its underlying social message and strong content. Now, we have plans for 'Aapla Manus 2' and shall make an announcement when everything is finalised. This film will also revolve around a contemporary social issue. We are looking at commercial content with a heart.”

 On his part, director Satish Rajwade says, “Working with producers who understand content so well was wonderful. It was a dream team and I am happy to be working with them again.
