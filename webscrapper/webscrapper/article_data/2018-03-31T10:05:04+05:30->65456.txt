NAGPUR: Of the 14,679 villages declared drought-hit in the state, 9,799 are from Vidarbha indicating that the already prevailing rural economic distress would continue. The crop survey and other due processes for the kharif season 2017-18 showed that these villages logged below 50 paisewari, the British era evaluation system, implying heavy crop losses and fall in farm incomes.

 Amravati revenue division comprising western Vidarbha districts of Amravati, Akola,  , Washim and Buldhana were the worst-hit. Shockingly, the survey found less than 50 paisewari in all surveyed villages of Amravati (1,963), Akola (990) and Yavatmal’s 2,049 villages. In Washim, 774 of the 793 villages were found to be drought-affected with relatively better situation in Buldhana where 748 of 1,420 villages were declared drought-hit.
 
 In eastern Vidarbha’s Nagpur division, only Chandrapur district had all its 1,794 villages getting in the list followed by 771 in Gondia and 544 in Bhandara district and only 166 in Gadchiroli.
 
 The drought-hit villages are entitled to a slew of sops provided by the government, including suspension of crop loan recovery, restructuring of loans taken from cooperative banks, exemption from land cess, tanker service for drinking water supply and slashing of power bills.
 
 Not a single village from Nagpur and Wardha districts figure in the list. The paddy-belt seems to have suffered much due to erratic monsoon last season.
 
 A government resolution of the revenue and forest departments issued on February 28 specifies the villages and relief measures to be implemented with immediate effect in the drought-hit villages. The district collectors have been given special powers for it.
 
 Among other revenue divisions, not a single village of Konkan was affected while the perennially dry zone of   was hit hard with 3,577 of its 8,525 surveyed villages found with below 50 paisewari. In   division, 1,002 villages and in Pune 301 villages made it to the list.
