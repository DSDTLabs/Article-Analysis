After hosting a successful Winter Olympics,   is set to be in the limelight again as the South Korean county readies itself to host the 2018 Winter   this week. 

 
 
 And Google is commemorating this occasion with a special   that represents athletes from various disciplines of the sports in competition, all racing together to capture a spot on the podium.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 80 countries around the world are sending their athletes to compete in the games, to be held from March 9 to 18 with over 670 athletes, including more female athletes than ever before, having the chance to show their skills after years of hard work and training.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 The lineup of the Paralympic games will include: alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, snowboarding, and wheelchair curling. Over the next 10 days, more than 80 medals will be awarded across the sports.
 
 The National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) of North and   will march separately at Friday’s (9 March) Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Paralympic Winter Games, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) announced on Thursday (8 March) evening.
 
 The IPC had offered both countries the chance to march together under the same conditions as last month’s Olympic Winter Games. However, despite a day of amicable and positive discussions between the two NPCs in the Paralympic Village, the two parties have decided not to march under the same conditions as the Olympic Opening Ceremony.
