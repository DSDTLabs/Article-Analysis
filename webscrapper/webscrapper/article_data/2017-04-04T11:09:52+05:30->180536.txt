LUCKNOW: As long as they were around,   ran around them, trying to impress the couple. They appeared to be from an affluent background and there was no reason to think otherwise till the duo vanished without   that amounted to Rs 3.04 lakh. The duo allegedly also duped five   staffers by taking money from them with the promise of government jobs.

 Police are investigating a case against Asad Mehendi Rizvi and Sneha Shah, the duo who managed to escape after enjoying hospitality at a plush hotel in Hazratganj for three months last year (September-November).
 
 The general manager of the hotel, Naveen Kumar, lodged an FIR at Hazratganj police station after Asad rebuked him over the phone, flatly refusing to foot the bill on Sunday. A flamboyant man, Asad had introduced himself as the son of an IAS officer and the director of NCR-based Ashirwad Developers Pvt Ltd.
 
 The two moved around in an SUV worth about Rs 15 lakh and knew the owner of the property for the past two-and-a-half years. “Asad seemed to be a suave man. He left the hotel suddenly on November 9. When we contacted him, he said he had some urgent work,” said hotel director Rahul Gurnani.
 
 Blaming demonetization, Asad bought time to make payment, stating that his business had taken a massive hit. He gave a cheque to the hotel manager but the payment was rejected due to insufficient funds.
 
 When things got out of hand, the hotel management decided to take action. They found out five staffers had also given money individually to Asad. “He boasted about his connections with senior government officials, politicians and we thought he would help us get government jobs,” said a hotel employee who was also cheated.
 
 Police have taken the IDs the two had furnished and found that Asad was a native of Siddharthnagar district. Additional superintendent of Lucknow (east) Shivram Yadav said in addition to Siddharthnagar, a team will be sent to the Noida office address that Asad had provided.
