AHMEDABAD: The symbol of Indian Mujahideen found on the wall of the rented bungalow at   near barrel market in Danilimda was drawn by key IM operative Atif Amin, who was later killed in an encounter at Batla house in Delhi.

 Crime branch sources said IM terrorist Yasin   was taken to the bungalow on Wednesday for purpose of a panchnama.
 
 “During his interrogation he confessed that he had stayed in the house for about five to six days and made about 30 bombs that were planted in the city on July 26, 2008. However, he had left the premises on July 18 for Bharuch to make bombs to be planted in Surat,” said ACP Rajdeepsinh Zala.
 
 When asked about the symbol of Indian Mujahideen of two swords and an AK 47 rifle drawn with charcoal in the building, Yasin had said it was Atif Amin who had sketched it, said Zala.
 
 Crime branch officials said they are also interrogating Yasin about his plans to carry out a fidayeen attack on Sabarmati jail to free 12 key alleged IM operatives, after the attempt to flee through a 213-feet tunnel dug from the barrack to the main jail wall had failed.
 
 “According to information from the NIA, which had interrogated Bhatkal while in their custody, Yasin had formed a Zarkavi brigade for the fidayeen attack on the instruction of IM operative Riyaz Bhatkal,” Zala said.
 
 Yasin Bhatkal and his associate were brought to the city on transfer warrant by city crime branch in the case of the July 2008 serial blasts.
 
 Crime branch sources said they have identified about 98 accused in the serial blasts case out of which about 18 including Bhatkal brothers Riyaz and Iqbal, and Subhan alias Tuakeer are still absconding.
