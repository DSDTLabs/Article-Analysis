Vijayawada: Corporate hospitals are burning holes in the pockets of people in the name of registration fees to maintain patients’ medical records. The hospitals Rs 150 to Rs 250 for the registration, which is of no use to patients, claiming that they have to keep each patient’s medical history for at least 10 years. However, the reality shows that no   is keeping track of the patients’ medical history and they are just selling folders to keep the prescriptions. 

 Surapaneni Venkata Krishna Mohan, who is originally from Hyderabad and staying in America, visited Vijayawada recently. He faced a bizzare situation on going to a private hospital with stomach pain. He alleged that the hospital had refused him the appointment with a doctor without registering his name there. “I could sense that some food poisoning resulted in the pain and i went to the hospital for advice to take some medicine. The hospital authorities told me to register with them for the medical records. I would never visit the hospital again after returning to the USA, and they don’t need to keep any medical record for me. Finally, I had to pay Rs 250 for the registration,” he said.
 
 “What astonished me was that the doctor wrote a prescription and I walked away with it. Neither the doctor nor any employee of the hospital took note of the prescription and updated it in their system. Many poor people will find it difficult for them to pay the   when it willbe of no use to them,” added Mohan.
