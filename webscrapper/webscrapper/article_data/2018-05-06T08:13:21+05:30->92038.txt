Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Haryana unit chief Naveen Jaihind asked the Brahmins to boycott   and the state government for showing disrespect to the community, especially its girls. "Khattar should tender a public apology and dismiss the HSCC chairman. He should take strict action against the person who set the question paper," said Jaihind.
