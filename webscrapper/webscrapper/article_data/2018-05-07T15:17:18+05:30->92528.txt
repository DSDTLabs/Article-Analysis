LUCKNOW: Annoyed over rumours about her proposed marriage to   president  , MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar   expressed her anger over the link-up on Sunday. 

 
  "I am really saddened by such baseless rumours being spread. Rahulji is like an elder brother to me. I ritualistically tie rakhi on his wrist. Those behind the link-up are absolutely wrong and aim to malign my image as also that of Rahul Gandhiji," the Congress MLA told TOI. 
  
  On who could be behind the rumours and what could be their intention, Aditi said, "Talk of my marriage with Rahul Gandhi is a propaganda in the wake of the Karnataka elections. The intention appears to be to distract the Congress leadership and workers toiling in Karnataka. It is anyone's guess who could be behind it." 
 
 
 
 
 Photographs showing Rahul with Aditi, and their families began circulating on social media on Saturday. The caption said that Rahul had finally found a match and that   was talking to Aditi's family to finalise things for the match.
 
  On Sunday, 29-year-old Aditi tweeted: " Afwaah phailane wale baaz aayein (those behind the rumour must mind themselves)." 
 
 
  
 
  
 In another tweet, Aditi clarified that the pictures used to support the rumours were taken during Sonia Gandhi's recent visit to Rae Bareli. 
 
  
  
 The daughter of five-time MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar seat Akhilesh Singh, Aditi made her debut in politics in 2017. Her father had quit the Congress party a long time ago. Believed to have been hand-picked by the Congress leadership for the Rae Bareli Sadar seat, Aditi is said to be close to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.
