Indore: With the Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE) all set to declare the Class X and XII state board results today, students in the city are anxious to find out exactly how well they fared in the  . The board will announce the results at 10am on the board’s official website.

 “Last year, results were good but merit holders were less. As Indore is an educational hub I think the result from here should be good and this year a total of 15 students from Class X and XII are merit holders from the city who will be felicitated on Friday by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Bhopal,” said SS Kaushal, district education officer.
 
 Unlike previous years, this year results of both classes will be announced on the same date and this was declared well in advance to avoid rumours. In previous years, a number of rumours would do the rounds before the board could even officially announce dates for results.
 
 With board results to be announced, most students naturally had butterflies in their stomach.
 
 “I had worked very hard for the board exams this year as I need to get good grades for the competitive exams also that I am preparing for. I’m keeping my fingers crossed and praying for good marks," said Radhika Rawat, a Class XII student from Pink Flower High School.
 
 This year, more than 20,00,000 students from all across the state appeared for their Class X board exams. A total of 40,238 regular students and 9,502 private candidates appeared for the exams from the city. For the Class XII exams, 27,914 regular students and 8,091 private students appeared for it from Indore.
 
 MPBSE conducted the board examination for the session 2016-17 in March-April 2016. The evaluation work also began simultaneously at over 50 evaluation centres across the state.
