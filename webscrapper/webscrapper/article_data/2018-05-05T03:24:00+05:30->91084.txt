Margao: The   Commission had made several recommendations to improve the administration of comunidades, including setting up of an advisory body on the modalities of administration by involving people from locality of comunidade. 

 In its over 250-page report submitted to the government in December 2015, the commission stated the government should have periodic conventions under Article 652 of the Code of Comunidades so that “the components of various comunidades can discuss their problems and suggest remedial action to the government”.
 
 The commission was constituted by the government on the high court’s directions following a petition by Celistinho Noronha over the functioning of the administration of comunidades. It was headed by then revenue minister Francis D’Souza as convenor. 
 
 It was directed to study the functioning and organisation of the administration offices and recommending measures for their efficient operations, identifying non-functional communidades and making recommendation for their liquidations for merger as per law, fixing accountability for the illegal acts committed by the administration offices over the years, among others. It had recommended to have an advisory body to advise the administrator on the legalities and modalities of administration.tnn
