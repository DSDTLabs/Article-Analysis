MUMBAI: A sessions court on Monday upheld a lower court verdict convicting and sentencing a 29-year-old man accused of   that killed a four-year-old girl in 2012. On January 6, 2016, Sanjay Dahay was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment after he was also found guilty for having procured a licence by submitting forged documents. Dahay, who was out on bail, will now have to serve the sentence. 

 On July 9, 2012, Kavya Binnani was on her way home from school with her mother Alka, when a  , driven by Dahay, rammed into her near the income-tax headquarters at  . Kavya, who suffered grievous injuries to the head and chest, was rushed Bombay Hospital, but she died. In early 2015, Dahay was traced to his village in Madhya Pradesh and brought back to the city.
 
 Monday’s verdict saw a repeat of scenes from January 6, 2016, when Kavya’s father Hemant had carried her photograph to court hoping that his first-born could hear that justice had been delivered. Hemant, who has relentlessly followed up on the case for over five years, was happy with the verdict. “This shows that if one keeps the faith, justice will be delivered,” Hemant told TOI. While the family earlier lived at Princess Street, they moved to Kalyan six months ago, making court appearances in south Mumbai a tedious affair.
