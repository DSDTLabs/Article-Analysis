KOCHI: Multi-level marketing (MLM) firms are attempting to ride piggyback on the   brand, trying to exploit its widenetwork and the trust it enjoys among the public. MLMs that deal with food supplements, household appliances, gold-plated ornaments and textiles have already tapped into Kudumbashree, focussing mainly on Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram.

 Kudumbashree office-bearers get a commission in exchange for striking deals. “MLMs are using Kudumbashree to increase their credibility; Kudumbashree members in turn get a commission of up to 15%, especially in deals like gold-plated ornaments. We will convene a meeting of chairpersons of three Community Development Society in Kochi to curb the racket,” said A B Sabu, chairperson, welfare standing committee,  , that controls Kudumbashree.
 
 Poornima Narayanan, chairperson, standing committee for education, Kochi Corporation has more details on how MLMs operate. “A meeting was held that was attended by 120 Kudumbashree area development society (ADS) secretaries as well as a representative of DXN, a MLM company. The representative briefed the participants on how to sell food supplements produced by the company,” Narayanan said.
