CHANDIGARH: In a first-ever major relief to builders, the Haryana government on Monday announced the issuance of provisional noobjection certificates (NOCs) by the fire department with regard to construction of 15,000 flats in   and Faridabad districts.

 Haryana department of urban local bodies officers said a meeting was organized with members of the executive committee of the National   Development Council (NAREDCO), an apex national body for real estate industry under the ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation, at CM  's residence.
 
 The issue was part of the 20-point memorandum submitted by the NAREDCO team headed by its president Parveen Jain. Khattar flew in from Rohtak to meet the delegation, which included heads of almost all leading developers and builders operating in Haryana.
 
 Earlier, the government had refused to rework the property tax formula as sought by the builders' body. It, however, gave an assurance with regard to an advertisement policy for places developed and maintained by private builders. The urban local bodies department had been insisting on sharing the revenue from advertisements in areas developed by such colonizers.
 
 “The meeting lasted for over three hours. We had a lot of issues to be discussed. The CM was kind enough to summon all department heads to discuss these. Some issues like fire clearances were resolved, while those solved on the spot included clearances for electricity usage and advertisements in colonies among others. This was a fruitful meeting,“ claimed Jain.
