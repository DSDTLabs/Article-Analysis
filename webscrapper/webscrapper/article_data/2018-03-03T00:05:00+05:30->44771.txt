When   filmmaker K Manju’s son Shreyas decided to get into movies, he thought that his first few days on set would be a breeze and that the team would go easy on him as he gets a hang of it all. But what actually transpired literally drained the youngster, as he was put through the wringer by director  . Shreyas had a tough three days for the promo song shoot for his  , Paddehuli. “Every day of the shoot, we would begin early in the morning and wind up at midnight. I had to dance and fight to the tunes of a very peppy number composed by B Ajaneesh Lokanath. It was exhausting, but the end result looks good,” says Shreyas.

 The idea behind a promo song, says Guru, was to give audiences an idea what Shreyas is capable of. “Normally, when a debutant is introduced, the film team releases   of his preparation for the role, be it at dance practice, gym workouts or fight training. We decided to skip that and instead showcase what he can do after all of this training. So, people will see how good he looks, how he dances and fights and more,” explains Guru.
