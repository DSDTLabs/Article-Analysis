CHENNAI: Former Union minister Dayanidhi   and his brother and chairman of   Kalanithi Maran cannot be discharged from the decade-old illegal telephone exchange case, since there is material evidence to prove their involvement in the crime,   informed the special court on Tuesday.

 The counsel for the central agency made the submission before the special court for CBI cases in Chennai.
 
 “Dayanidhi Maran has abused his official position as a Union minister and member of parliament in getting illegal telephone connections to   owned by his brother Kalanithi Maran. The Maran brothers and other employees of Sun Group have criminally conspired to commit the offences, thereby causing financial loss to the government. There is incriminating evidence to prove their involvement in the crime,” the counsel said.
 
 The CBI wanted the court to dismiss the discharge pleas and continue the trial. Opposing the arguments, the Maran brothers submitted that the allegation that there were 700 telephone lines was wrong. As the then telecom minister, only 10 lines were provided to Dayanidhi Maran’s residence, first in   and later in Boat Club area.
 
 The CBI had failed to understand the latest technology. If they have understood, they would not have pursued this case, Maran brothers said while seeking the court to discharge them from the case. Recording the submissions, the court directed the parties to submit their written arguments on March 6.
