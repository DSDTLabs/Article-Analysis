Margao: On the Aquem-Margao side of the Margao Konkan railway corporation (KRC) station, there are nearly two dozen illegal makeshift fast food kiosks functioning without permissions from the authorities.

 This was discovered during a surprise inspection drive conducted by Margao municipal council ( ) chairperson   and councillor   with the media in tow, on Friday morning. 
 
 The chairperson undertook this drive following a complaint by KRC authorities while she attended the inauguration of Margao KRC station’s fourth platform.
 
  Prabhudessai discovered that the roadside kiosks were serving eatables prepared under unhygienic conditions as the vendors have been cooking and washing their utensils over the nearby chocked drains. 
 
 Dr Prabhudessai told the media that she “had called up MMC chief officer   and issued him stern instructions to clear up these illegalities without succumbing to pressure from anyone.” She also called up the Margao fire station deputy director   and patiently waited for nearly 45 minutes for him to join them in the inspection as the vendors were using domestic gas cylinders for cooking. However, Raikar sent his junior officials. It is only after the media brought to Raikar’s attention that the illegal vendors were claiming that they were receiving his patronage that Raikar conducted an inspection denying the allegations and feigned total ignorance of this menace. Later, Raikar promised that he would undertake a drive from Saturday.
