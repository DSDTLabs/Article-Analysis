PUNE: The   ( ) plans to set up an automated retail packed food dispenser machine at the Pune airport, for which an expression of interest (EoI) has already been issued.

 The move aims to provide flyers with a wide range of food options at the airport. “The machine will serve hygienically packed hot meals from popular restaurants in the city,” an airport official said, adding that the plan was in its nascent stage. “Therefore, it is difficult to give out a date when the machine/machines will be installed,” he said.
 
  
 The official said there are three fully operational restaurants outside the airport terminal building, besides the food and snack outlets inside the terminal building. “The new machine will be an added option for the passengers,” he added.
 
 Giving out details about the food dispenser machine, another airport official said it would be similar to soft drink vending machine. “It will dispense food once the money is inserted in it and the right button is pressed,” he added.
 
 The official said the food menu will change as per the demand from the flyers. 
 
 “Once a flyer places an order, each product will be picked up by the robotic arm of the machine, the top lid of the food packed with be pierced to create a steam vent and then reheated to the right temperature seconds ahead of delivery,” he said, adding that the entire system will be unique and world class.
 
 “If the expiry date of the food item has passed, it will not be served even if ordered by a passenger,” he added.
 
 Raunak Shah, a frequent flyer, said, “Though food options have increased at the Pune airport, there is still lot to be desired. Many outlets inside the airport serve the same thing and there are not many choices. I have been to the Kolkata airport and they have drastically improved upon the food options for passengers now. Same can be said about Delhi and Mumbai airports too.”
