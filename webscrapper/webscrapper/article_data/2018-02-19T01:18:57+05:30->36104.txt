GURUGRAM: Union minister of state and Gurgaon MP   said on Sunday the government was taking all possible steps so that the city got its share of development as the biggest revenue earner in the state.

 From flyovers to de-congest the city to improving the public transport system, Singh listed several projects to buttress his claim and said the Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority had been formed to ensure development.
 
 “The city generates maximum revenue for the state of Haryana and it is necessary that a proportionate amount of development takes place in the city. It is in this regard that we have formed the Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority, which will handle major projects, while the corporation will take care of internal development,” he said.
 
 A number of projects in the city are either running behind schedule or have come under criticism from residents over their implementation. The Gurgaon municipal corporation is currently working on multiple development projects in the city, including an integrated waste management project, LED street light project and a plan to install CCTV cameras. While the waste management plan has faced several complaints from residents, the street light plan is a month behind schedule.
 
 The minister then went on to broach the topic of traffic congestion and referred to the underpass and flyover projects at four major junctions — Rajiv Chowk, Signature Tower Chowk, Iffco Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk.
 
 Singh also spoke about the city bus service which is expected to be launched in August this year. Singh, the local MP, was in town to inaugurate development projects worth Rs 3 crore in his ward number 33 in Gurgaon. The projects include a community centre in  , a park and a parking lot.
