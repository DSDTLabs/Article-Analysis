The battle for supremacy in poll-bound Karnataka is not just being fought on the ground.   in the US are also on the job of setting an agenda on what should be discussed on social media so that it could trend.

 
 The idea is to laud   and show   in poor light. And, to execute it, some topics are given with a specific hashtag to trend on Twitter. TOI has got a list of tweets that were to ensure that the hashtag #SidhuTopsinCrime trends.
 
 The ‘Namo Twitter Warriors Group’, which ostensibly functions from the US, provided several sample tweets that were put out on social media from 8am (IST) on Tuesday (April 17). On Wednesday morning, NaMo Warriors ensured #ShahSaffronSurge was trending on Twitter.
 
 The May 12 polls in Karnataka are turning out to be interesting as both BJP and Congress are fighting it out bitterly on social media, poking fun at each other, and losing no opportunity to take a dig at each other.
 
 A few days ago, BJP’s Karnataka unit found the downpour in Bengaluru a good enough handle to lash out against Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.
 
 “No matter how much Siddaramaiah spends on his ads, these bloody rains hit Bengaluru for just 2 hours and totally puncture Siddu’s claims! ‘Varuna’ is playing spoilsport with Siddaramaiah everywhere!” BJP Karnataka tweeted on April 16.
 
 While the cheeky tweets are with an instant presence of mind, the more organised way is to put out tweets on several issues with a hashtag that is decided so that it would trend.
 
  
 The Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP), USA, which is at work on how to get tweets to trend for the overall benefit of the party, however, does not list this function in its list of six objectives. These include “to work towards projecting a positive and correct image of India and its people in the US and foreign media, and correct any distortions in the media’s reporting of current events taking place in India”, and “to promote the philosophy of Integral Humanism”.
