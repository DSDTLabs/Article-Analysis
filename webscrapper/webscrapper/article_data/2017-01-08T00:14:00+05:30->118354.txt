Hyderabad: Principal of Ifham Talent School Khaja Zainulabedin arrested in a suicide case of ninth standard student Mirza Salman Baig was sent to remand on Saturday by the Kanchanbagh police station. 

 While the owner of the school Sakira Begum too was arrested by the police, she was let go on medical conditions. “She developed chest pain due to which we had to let her go. However, she will again be arrested once her health conditions improve,” said N Shankar, inspector at Kanchanbagh police station. 
 
 Salman’s family opposed the police’s move. “The police should not have left her even on medical grounds. We hope that they arrest her soon and that justice is delivered by the government by shutting the school which indulges into such practices,” said Basheer Baig, brother of Salman, who is the complainant in the case.
