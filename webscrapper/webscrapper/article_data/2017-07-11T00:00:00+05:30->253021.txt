The South Indian film industry has always been united and the audio launch of Shivarajkumar-starrer Mass Leader was further proof of that. The event saw Telugu star   release the music of the film. In fact, Balayya, as the actor is fondly known by fans, was in Bengaluru recently to offer his condolences to the Rajkumar family following the demise of Parvathamma Rajkumar. Bangalore Times had then reported that Balayya would be releasing the audio of the film. At the event on Sunday, the Tollywood star praised   and spoke about how their families have known each other for years. “Our families have shared a close association. In fact, if my father was Ramu in Tollywood, Rajkumar was   in Sandalwood. Similarly, if I am Legend in Tollywood, Shivarajkumar is the Mass Leader in Sandalwood. I consider him to be like my brother and that is why I chose to be by his side at the launch,” said Balayya. In fact, Shivarajkumar was also seen in the Tollywood star’s landmark 100th film   in a cameo in one of the songs.
