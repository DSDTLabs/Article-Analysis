AURANGABAD: The   on Tuesday informed that they would not be able to meet the   target for the ongoing financial year 2016-17.

 Despite pushing hard, the municipal authorities have failed miserably to recover dues from property owners. For the last three to four years, the   ( ) had been collecting between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 80 lakh in the month of March.
 
 However, this year, in the first six days, the recovery has been limited in the range of Rs 20 lakh to Rs 25 lakh every day. As per the financial budget, the municipal authorities need to recover property taxes worth Rs 230 crore, but till Monday the total recovery was about Rs 71 crore — including Rs 17 crore recovered in November 2016 after demonetisation.
 
 The AMC recently launched an aggressive drive for property tax recovery and assigned additional officers and clerks for the same. Apart from the existing officers and employees working in wards offices, additional workforce of 115 employees has been deployed for tax recovery. In addition to this, special teams are working in all the six zones of the city.
 
 The authorities have been sealing commercial properties of defaulters, but the recovery is not reaching a satisfactory level. “Most of the regular tax payers who used to pay taxes in March had already paid it post demonetisation when the government had allowed them to pay taxes in old currency notes,” said one of the AMC ward engineers.
 
 Recently, AMC chief   had also said that the most of the regular tax payers have cleared their due. “But we are expecting significant amount in last two week of the month when many commercial and government agencies pay their taxes,” he said.
