BHUBANESWAR: The   ( ) on Tuesday slapped a fine (environmental compensation) of Rs 25,000 on the   (BMC) for open burning of municipal solid waste at its designated dump yard in  , near Daruthenga village, on the outskirts of the city. 

 Acting on a complaint by locals, the OSPCB officials inspected the site and found a massive fire there. "Although the cause of the fire is yet to be known, it is the responsibility of the BMC to ensure that waste is not burnt in the open. The National Green Tribunal has clearly prohibited open burning of waste," said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi.
 
 The pollution board issued a notice to BMC commissioner   and asked him to stop the open burning immediately. "The BMC is responsible for such illegal activity. You are directed to stop open burning and file a compliance report," said OSPCB's letter to the BMC.
 
 Officials of OSPCB said open burning of solid waste - piles of polythene in this case - emit dioxin, furan, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These are dangerous if mixed with the ambient air. The BMC has been dumping municipal solid waste in Daruthenga, a village that does not fall under its area, for the last eight years. Around 500 metric tonnes of garbage are dumped there every day.
 
 The BMC said it had sent two fire engines to the site to douse the flames. "Since smoke is billowing out of the dump, the firemen will need at least five hours to completely extinguish it," said an officer.
 
  Deputy commissioner (sanitation)   said the fire could be accidental. "We cannot use the waste as landfill as the matter is currently in the court," he told TOI.
