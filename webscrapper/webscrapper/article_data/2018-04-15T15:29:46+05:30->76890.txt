Singer   said he and his husband want to expand their brood. 

  
  
 The 46-year-old singer, who has nine-year-old twins   and   which he now shares with husband   whom he wed in January, said they are only getting started. "(We were two kids and one dad) and then it became two daddies and two children. And we're only starting - we want a bigger family. We want more babies," Martin told .
 
 The   star said he is beyond impressed with the level of intellect of his children and is trying to expose them "to sports, to life, to the arts" as much as possible. 
 
 "The conversations I have with them nowadays are just incredible. The level of their intellect is so out there. I wasn't thinking that way when I was nine-years-old. The questions that they come up with, the conclusions they reach at such a young age - it's evolution. It's very noticeable, the difference between one generation to the other."
 
 "They are smarter than me! It's incredible. One of my sons is a storyteller and he uses a very beautiful and elaborate vocabulary - in English - and the other one, Matteo, is almost a black belt in martial arts," he said.
