Hollywood star   has dismissed rumours that he is being "phased out" as  . 

 The 44-year-old actor, who has played the iconic superhero in DC's ' ' and ' ', took to the stage at San Diego Comic Con and said he would be continuing in the role.
 
  
  
 "My status remains what it always is. I've done the two movies. I've always intended on doing a third if Warners wants to make it. Certainly, if the Batphone rings, I will answer," Affleck said. 
 
 The actor blamed some of the reports on his decision to step down from the directorial duties on 'The Batman' in January of this year. 
 
 "It's such a big job, in terms of the stunts and the suit and the action and the character. Trying to do that, and direct, would probably be too much. Something would be compromised. I think it came off, optically, to the broader world, like lack of interest or enthusiasm. When in fact I love this character." 
 
 Affleck said he supported the studio's choice of director for ;The Batman'.
 
 "I think getting   to come in and do it is really, really exciting."
