MUMBAI: An under construction high rise in   was raided by the   on Wednesday, and they came across electricity   allegedly for construction purposes since 2015.

 "For the past one and a half years, the builder has been pilfering electricity of 24kW estimated to be to the tune of Rs 80 lakh and we will slap a fine on him. We have also submitted a complaint to Shivaji Park police for a FIR to be registered in the case,'' said BEST chief vigilance officer R J Singh. He stated that an official 3-phase meter was taken for the under construction building more than a year back. â€œBut this meter was being used for running a fan and tubelight, while most construction activities of the proposed 17-storeyed building were being undertaken using power which was being illegally drawn from the main cable," he alleged.
 
 The BEST's vigilance cell has been cracking a whip on power thefts in high rise apartments, hotels, restaurants for the past two years. A week back, it had registered a complaint against a tea strainer manufacturing unit with the Byculla police. During its raid, the vigilance staff found that electricity supply was taken illegally by the firm. "The pilferage was for the past seven years and the firm had consumed close to 40 lakh units of electricity worth Rs 10 crore, sources said," Singh said.
 
 In April this year, a FIR was registered against the owner of a two-storey restaurant in Mahim for allegedly stealing power through an idle cable. The cable used for stealing power, changeover switches, and energy meters were deposited at Mahim police station. The BEST slapped a hefty fine on the restaurant owner.
