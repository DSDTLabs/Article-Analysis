IBBAN (Kapurthala): Different candidates have different ways of preparing for campaigning ahead of a tough election. Punjabâ€™s richest candidate in the February 4 election, sugar baron   went for a weight loss programme to Britain last year as he was finding it difficult to take on the rough and tumble of rural Punjab with extra flab.

 The three-time   MLA from Kapurthala has shed 15kg since October when he weighed 92kg.
 
 After twirling his moustache and rubbing sanitiser on his hands, Congress candidate Rana Gurjit Singh takes some gluten-free chapatis with a dab of buffalo butter and a bowl of curd in the morning right before leaving for his campaign.
 
 The programme in Britain cost him nearly Rs1.4 lakh. "I went for a specific food antibodies test which is commonly called the food detective test in the UK. They found that wheat, gluten, yeast, dairy and eggs, potato and radish made me prone to obesity," said the 64-year-old. "I had begun to weigh a lot and moving around in villages had become taxing," he added.
 
 Singh has been officially declared the richest candidate in Punjab with assets worth Rs 169 crore. He owns a sugar mill and a liquor distillery. Ironically, today he can't consume the sugar that his company produces. He takes only beet sugar that is produced from turnip.
