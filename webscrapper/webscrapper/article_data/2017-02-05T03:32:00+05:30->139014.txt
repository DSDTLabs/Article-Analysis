Panaji: Voting was peaceful in   constituency, which was declared ‘sensitive’ by the Election Commission (EC) following earlier incidents of friction between the supporters of MLA Rohan Khaunte, and BJP candidate Guruprasad Pawaskar.

  Sources said the two areas that were likely to witness tense moments were the 20-point programme colony and Butki in Socorro. But, on the night before the polls, both camps dismissed fears that any untoward incident would take place. 
 
 “Goans are peaceful. The areas where migrants have settled may see some problems. But, I don’t think anything will happen,” a BJP functionary said. In fact, there was a bit of camaraderie between polling agents of both candidates in certain areas of the constituency. tnn
