Sue   says   was the best James  , even though she co-starred with Roger Moore in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. 

 "I like Daniel Craig as Bond. I loved his first movie. But he's obviously not the best Bond. There's no question about it - Sean Connery was the best Bond ever!" Sue says. 
 
  
  
 And although she chose Sean, Sue insisted her co-star Roger, 89, was extremely sexy. 
 
 "He was quite sexy, and obviously my scene was very sexy because he was making love to me! I was semi naked - I had no top on, but I was wearing pants for the scene."
