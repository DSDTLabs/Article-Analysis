MUMBAI: The city crime branch has arrested a 53-year-old   who, under the pretext of clearing an attached property of a 32-year-old woman, conned her of Rs 76 lakh. 

  The property cell of the crime branch has charged   for   and criminal intimidation. 
 
  The complaint was filed by  , a garment trader, who had a nine-acre ancestral property at Chakala in Andheri. 
 
 Sood told the police that as she had defaulted on property tax in 2007, the property was attached. In 2008, she approached Tiwari to get the property de-attached.
 
  Tiwari took Rs 16 lakh from Sood, but didn't deliver. In 2016, he told her they needed more money. He told her a person in Germany owed him a lot of money and requested her to recover it on his behalf. 
 
  "Since Sood was travelling to Germany on official work, she agreed," said an officer. 
 
  A day prior, on March 10, Tiwari called her and said he urgently needed Rs 60 lakh and that he would adjust the money against the Euros she would be getting in Frankfurt. 
 
  Sood arranged for the money to be given to Tiwari. However, Tiwari later told Sood a friend of his had fled with the money. 
 
  Sood was in for another shock in Frankfurt. When she reached the address provided by Tiwari, four men handed her a bag. Sood has told the police they held a gun to her head and told her to open it only on reaching the hotel. She later found scrap paper inside. 
 
 Tiwari was picked up from   on Wednesday. He has confessed he siphoned off the money.
