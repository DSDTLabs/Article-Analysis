A 1979 Sri Lankan law that banned the sale of alcohol to women was last week overturned in a bid to strike sexist bills from the statute books. The country also repealed a ban on women working in places where alcoholic drinks are made or sold, including bars.

 
 "The idea was to restore gender neutrality," a spokesman for the country's finance ministry told AFP.
 
 
 
  However, the move generated backlash, with the country's   going so far as to accuse finance minister   of encouraging drinking.
 
 
 
  Fazed by the criticism, the island-nation's president   reimposed the ban.
 
 "From tomorrow (Monday), the minister's order will be rescinded," his office said in a statement.
 
 
 
  According to  's EconomyNext news service, Sirisena claimed that he was "committed to building a society based on democracy, freedom, justice and good behaviour" while reordering the ban.
 
 
 
 Some of the new measures introduced by the finance minister also allowed bars and pubs to remain open longer. However, these were also rescinded by the president.
