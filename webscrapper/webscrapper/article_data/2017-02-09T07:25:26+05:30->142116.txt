NAGPUR: The state home department on Tuesday   into the   to the CID. BJP MLA   had earlier asked chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to order a CID inquiry, after Ambazari police invoked section 307 (attempt to murder) against his two sons in December 2016.

 Superintendent of CID Arti Singh told TOI, “We have received order from the home department but the case papers are yet to be submitted by Ambazari police.”
 
 Khopde’s sons Abhilash and Rohit were charged with attempt to murder of Sawan Bambrotwar, son of a bar operator, following a drunken brawl at restro-lounge and   near   in November last year. The duo’s friend Mahakalkar had later been stabbed to death at Laxmi Bhuvan Square. The Khopde brothers got bail on December 20.
 
 Khopde had organized a press meet and claimed that the police ‘did not conduct a proper inquiry and invoked the sections of attempt to murder against his sons and others under the pressure of senior officers’. Police have also helped the murder mastermind get bail, Khopde alleged.
 
 Abhilash and his friends were enjoying a feast when one of the waiters attracted their wrath for intervening into a dispute over alleged teasing of a woman. Abhilash and his friends started complaining about slack service by waiters. The disagreement escalated when Abhilash started clamouring for discount in the bill. Abhilash’s friend smashed a liquor bottle on Sawan’s head, who called up Pramod, the bar operator, and his brother Shobit. Abhilash too informed Mahakalkar and Rohit, who too reached the spot. Later, an annoyed Shobit, following the instruction of Pramod, stabbed Mahakalkar to death and escaped from the spot.
