New Delhi: Faced with strain in ties with some NDA allies just a year before the Lok Sabha elections, BJP swung into damage control on Tuesday as party chief Amit Shah met UP ally   of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party while Union minister   and party general secretary   held discussions with LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan. 

 Days after  's TDP pulled out of the NDA and sought to move a "no-confidence" motion in the Lok Sabha along with YSR Congress, Rajbhar and Paswan, an ally from Bihar, came up with comments which BJP thought could send wrong signals.
 
 Shah met Rajbhar here on Tuesday, after his comment that he was unsure whether his party's four MLAs would vote for BJP in the upcoming   elections for 10 seats from UP. After the meeting, however, Rajbhar expressed satisfaction. "My party will vote for NDA candidates in the Rajya Sabha polls. I had a good meeting with BJP president Amit Shah who assured me of heeding to our demands including that of regular interactions," Rajbhar, a UP minister, told TOI. "Problem was lack of communication... I was seeking time with Shah for the last eight months. He has promised to look into our demands like accommodating the Rajbhar community in the existing 27% quota for scheduled castes," he said.
 
 After his meeting with Yadav and Pradhan, Paswan dismissed as "unthinkable" suggestions that his alliance with BJP is under strain. He was critical of some BJP leaders making communal statements recently and advised the party to take along all sections of society, setting off speculation about his future plans. "The NDA is not in any difficulty. I had said that there is no vacancy for the Prime Minister's post in 2019. Narendra Modi will remain PM and NDA will remain intact," he told reporters.
