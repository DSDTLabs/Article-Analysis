Shimla: Himachal Pradesh leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal on Saturday said that the last four and half years of Congress rule in the state would be a black chapter due to rampant corruption, nepotism and mafia rule. He said the state has a debt burden of over Rs 50,000 crore for which the wrong economic policies of the Congress government were responsible.

 Dhumal said this while addressing the state executive meeting of BJP in Shimla. He said that the border areas of the state were grappling with mining, drug and liquor mafia while under government patronage, land and forrest mafia were looting the state’s resources. 
 
 The former chief minister also said there was also resentment against the government for its failure to fulfill over 70% of the promises made in the 2012 election manifesto. He said the Congress government failed to start any new scheme in the state and also stopped developmental schemes initiated during the previous BJP regime.
 
 During its state executive meeting, BJP passed a resolution condemning the state government on the dwindling law and order situation in the state. The resolution also mentioned the recent gangrape and murder of a minor girl in Kotkhai which caused widespread public resentment against the government.
 
 While addressing media persons in Shimla, Kangra MP of NJP, Shanta Kumar attacked the chief minister Virbhadra Singh. He said that before being ousted, Virbhadra should himself demit office. He said the hill state that was known as “land of god” is witnessing rampant crime, so the Congress high command should remove Virbhadra Singh immediately.
