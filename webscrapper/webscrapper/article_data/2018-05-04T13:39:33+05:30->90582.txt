GHAZIABAD: A survey will begin soon for a connecting road joining   Flyway and the   Elevated Road that the Ghaziabad Development Authority ( ) is planning to build.

 The road, according to GDA sources, could be built along the Hindon canal that enters Delhi from Indirapuram and runs all the way to Noida. Officials, however, said the proposal was still at a nascent stage and it was too early to conclusively speak about the alignment of the proposed connector.
  
  
 But along the Hindon canal seems the most likely option as the Hindon Elevated Road already has one arm — the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway — going under NH-24 and skirting the canal before it turns right to meet the highway.
 
 The GDA said it intends to appoint a consultant by the end of the month to prepare a feasibility report. GDA has also sent a proposal to the NCR Planning Board for approval.
 
 “The plan to extend Hindon Elevated road to DND Noida came up for discussion last December as it was felt it would provide seamless flow of traffic from Delhi to the heart of Ghaziabad via Noida,” said Ritu Maheshwari, vice-chairperson of GDA. “We plan to appoint a consultant by the end of this month to prepare a feasibility report along with the detailed project report,” added Maheshwari.
 
 Maheshwari did not comment on the alignment of this connecting road. A GDA official, who declined to be named, said, “The Hindon Elevated Road ends at UP Gate, and if the extension of this road is to take place, it could happen only along the Hindon Canal Road where there is no dearth of land.”
 
 The benefits of a connecting road are significant. It can bring cars from south Delhi straight to Indirapuram and onward to Raj Nagar Extension in a very short time without having to take NH-24. It will also let traffic from Ghaziabad city reach Noida and south Delhi in the same manner, significantly cutting down on travel time.
