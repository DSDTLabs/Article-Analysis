MUMBAI: The   has met the management of private medical colleges and the government authorities to discuss the matter of   fees. This year the FRA cancelled the differential fee structures for state seats, institutional quota and NRI seats and notified that all private colleges need to be quota-blind in terms of their tuition. 

 Last year, many colleges set NRI and management seats at three to four times the merit and state quota fees. 
 
 Private institutes had refused to participate in the admission process. “We told the FRA that we have been following the three-tier fee system and the same is being followed since 20 years. That was DMER’s proposal,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research. tnn
