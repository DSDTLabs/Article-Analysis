 The state government has been complaining before the ministry of railways about the delay of projects in different parts of the state. The government said the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a central government enterprise, takes more time for execution of projects. 
 
 When asked about this, Gohain said he has discussed with RVNL chairman and managing director about the slow progress of the projects. "I will again meet them and tell them to speed up the project works," he added.
 
 Government chief whip Amar Prasad Satpathy said the state government is very much cooperative to expedite the ongoing railway projects. "Our government is not delaying land acquisition process," he added. 
 
 RVNL's major project is Haridaspur-Paradip (82 km) new line. This project was sanctioned in 1996-97. Only 65% of the work have been completed till date. Railways sources said the project will be completed by March 2018. The other ongoing projects are Sambalpur-Titlagarh doubling (182 km) and Raipur-Titlagarh doubling (203 km).
