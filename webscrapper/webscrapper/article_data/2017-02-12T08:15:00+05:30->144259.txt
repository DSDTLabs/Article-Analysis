NOIDA: The Noida candidates of   and   on Saturday were booked for violating the model code of conduct by allegedly sending bulk messages to voters and urging them on social media platforms to vote on Saturday. However, the officials of the two parties expressed their ignorance and claimed that some party volunteers might have made the mistake.

 Amit Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate and returning officer for Noida, said Ravi Kant Mishra of BSP and Sunil Chaudhury of SP sent messages on phones and social media on polling day. 
 
 “This is against the model code of conduct since the campaign ended 48 hours before the polls. I have directed officers of the Sector 20 police station to register an FIR against the two candidates,” he said.
 
 A photo of the poll campaign was shared from Mishra’s Facebook account. A post read, “You are requested to vote and contribute in making a healthy democracy. Choose a candidate from among yourselves and help Noida develop and become crime-free,” it said. A short video clip of Sunil Chaudhury urging voters was also shared from his official Facebook page on Friday but was later removed. 
 
 BJP workers complained to the district administration about the violation by the two candidates.
 
 Anil Pratap Singh, SHO of Sector 20 police station, said an FIR under Section 188 of the IPC was registered against the two candidates.
 
 Jyotsna Arora, media coordinator of Mishra, said the party officials have not received information about the case. “We did not campaign on polling day. It is possible the message got delayed in online traffic and was delivered late. We will get it checked,” she said.
