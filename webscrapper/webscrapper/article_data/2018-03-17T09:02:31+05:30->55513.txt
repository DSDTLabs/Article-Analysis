ALAPPUZHA: Nair votes are considered decisive in   assembly constituency, which has 1,88,702 registered voters. With the three fronts declaring their candidates and hitting the campaign trail, NSS union in Chengannur has directed all karayogams to present their voter details and expected votes for each candidate.

 Chengannur NSS taluk union secretary B K Mohandas said the Nair community has around 90,000 voters from over 30, 000 families in the assembly constituency. NSS has 84 karayogams under Chengannur taluk union and 14 karayogams under the Mavelikkara taluk union. “We are in the process of updating the data,” he said.
 
 
 According to NSS leaders, the party and the candidate which favours their community will win the bypoll.
 
 A senior NSS leader said though Chengannur is a traditional bastion of Congress, K K Ramachandran Nair of CPM won the 2016 assembly polls because of his influence he wielded among the public. “We strongly believe that the influence the candidate has among people in Chengannur is a major factor that would decide victory. The Nair community had warmly welcomed the decision of the LDF government to give 10% quota to forward communities in devaswom boards. But people face many issues like acute shortage of potable water and they are not completely happy with the LDF government. All these elements will be afactor in deciding the winner,” he said.
 
 The Ezhava community also has a strong presence in Chengannur. SNDP Yogam general secretary   said they have 41,000 voters from 13,827 families registered under 73 branches in the assembly constituency. BJP’s   had gained 42,682 votes in Chengannur in the 2016 election.   Thushar Vellappally had claimed that BJP could augment their 6,062 votes in 2011because of the support of BDJS.
