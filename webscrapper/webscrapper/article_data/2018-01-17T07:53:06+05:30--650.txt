The next day, Togadia alleged that attempts were being made to muzzle his voice.On Monday, Hardik had also raised doubts regarding the mysterious disappearance of Togadia. He tweeted: “Why home minister is silent over Pravin Togadiaji’s disappearance/ Why Togadiaji’s security personnel were not suspended? Why the BJP and VHP people were not tense over this incident.”
