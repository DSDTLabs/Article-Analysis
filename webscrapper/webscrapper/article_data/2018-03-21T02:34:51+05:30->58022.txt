NEW DELHI: Ever since   started protesting outside Vasant Kunj police station,   has virtually been out of bounds for traffic. While cops had left one carriageway of the   road open, protests throughout Tuesday forced them to divert the traffic. The situation is expected to improve from Wednesday.

 Vehicles going towards the airport were asked to take Aruna Asaf Ali Marg and head to Kishangarh for taking Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road. Local residents were also asked to take alternate routes through Basant Gaon and Qutub Enclave.
 
 Residents said that the protesters didn’t even give space for ambulances to pass. In a Facebook post, a resident claimed that she saw a child bleeding in his mother’s arms near Vasant Kunj police station. However, the protesters didn’t yield even as the mother kept pleading for help.
 
 “I walked down to the epicentre of the cause to find students of   dancing to the beat of the drums and singing ‘aazadi’. I tried to reason with them… they said, that’s not our problem…” the woman’s post stated.
 
 Police said that even when the protests halted intermittently, they had to keep the roads barricaded to prevent the protesters from suddenly barging into the police station while the statements of the victims of sexual harassment were being recorded. The barricading led to massive chaos during peak hours, severely affecting airport-bound vehicles that had taken the road to avoid the choked Rao Tula Ram Marg.
