With little less than a month left for October 2, the rural parts of the state have achieved 87% open-defecation-free status this year and 18,640 gram panchayats have been included in the category. Around 9,000 villages have to achieve the target as the deadline ends next year.
 
 A gram panchayat in   has pledged free foodgrain for villages getting rid of the practice of defecation in the open. On the other hand, several villages in other parts of the state have rolled out programmes such as free-of-cost health checkup camps for those using toilets.There are, however, complaints about villages not falling in line. Quite a number of villages have put in place good morning squads to keep a check on the unhealthy practice. Till now, 11 districts, including Pune, have been declared free of open defecation.“We have one more year to achieve the target. For this, we are in troducing innovative initiatives and rolling out several incentives,“ a senior sanitation official in the state government said.
 
 The deadline for the urban areas in the state ends this October. The rural areas have, on the other hand, re-started various programmes to meet the deadline (2018) at the earliest.
 
 Among the initiatives are a WhatAapp radio group and “good morning“ and “evening“ squads to keep a check on defecation in the open in the rural parts of the state.
 
 Government said while efforts were made to document the good practices at different levels this year, open defecation continued in other villages. The urban development department has through an order asked mayors, corporators and senior bureaucrats to visit cities and ensure people did not defecate. For the rural areas, committees have been appointed to keep an update on the developments.
