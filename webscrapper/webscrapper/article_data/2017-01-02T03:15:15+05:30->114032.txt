NEW DELHI: Union information and broadcasting minister M   said on Sunday that the   unfolding in the ruling   Party in UP was a “comedy which was sometimes a melody and would end in a tragedy” in the upcoming state polls. 

 “People will reject the party in the upcoming elections. Because of this family feud, they have been further weakened,” Naidu said. 
 
 Terming it as an insult to democracy,   spokesman   said Mulayam Singh Yadav has scripted the high-voltage drama to divert attention from the failures of his son and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who has failed on all fronts and was now resorting to different games to misguide the people. “People in the state are smart and understand the entire game plan of the Samajwadi Party and Mulayam Singh Yadav family. Their drama will not of of any use as people are determined to throw away the party,” Sharma said. 
 
 The BJP member said that the fact a leader was expelled and then taken back within hours shows the state of a party that is “owned” by one family. “Akhilesh will have to answer for the failures like poor power and water supply other than serious law and order crisis in the state,” Sharma said.
