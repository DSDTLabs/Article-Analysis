After failing spectacularly on two occasions to get the better of Goldberg, 'The Beast Incarnate'   finally overcame his personal demon and beat Goldberg to became the fourth   Universal champion. 

 
  
  
 
 The much-hype rematch at the grandest stage of them all lived up to the expectations with Lesnar hitting Goldberg with four straight German suplexes right off the bat. But the former WCW superstar shot back immediately with a spear. Goldberg continued the assault and even put Lensar through the barricades with another spear, a jack hammer followed and it seems that was it for Lesnar. However, much to the shock of the Orlando crowd, Lesnar kicked out.
 
 
  
  
 
 Goldberg attempted another spear but Lesnar leaped high enough to evade and Goldberg went head first in to the turn buckle. This was the chance Lesnar was waiting for and he picked up Goldberg again and again and again to deliver six straight Germans to finally subdue the Goldberg and became the WWE Universal Champion.
