Panaji: A photo   organised by a central government ministry in association with GAIL India to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement and progress towards a ‘New India’, received a poor response on its opening day. The structure erected for the four-day event at Kala Academy lay empty after the inauguration. The exhibition, whose theme is, ‘Naya Bharat Hum Karke Rahenge’, was opened by Union minister for heavy industries and public sector enterprises, Anant Gangaram Geete.

 Students from a number of city-based schools were brought in as audience for the opening ceremony by the minister, but soon after he left, the students followed suit. There were hardly any walk-ins to view the exhibits and no demonstrator to explain them either.
 
 At the event opening, Geete said, “We have to decide that India needs to join the league of developed countries. It cannot happen if only the Prime Minister decides or the government thinks so. It will happen when the public decides. I am very happy that I have been handed the responsibility for Goa.”
 
 Anup Gupta of GAIL India said the exhibition is being held in 39 locations across the country, including all capital cities and district headquarters. He added that the event in Goa is expected to get a better response in the coming days. “We expect 600 to 700 students to attend everyday. Student across the country are being administered pledges to free India of poverty, garbage issues, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism, and create a new India by 2022, as per the PM’s vision.”
 
 Gupta said there would be a demonstrator present to explain the exhibits to visitors from Wednesday onwards.
