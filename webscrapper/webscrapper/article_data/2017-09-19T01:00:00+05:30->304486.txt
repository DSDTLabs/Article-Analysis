While writing the screenplay for the 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle', it is likely that   and Jane Goldman hit up a bar. We have reason to believe so. In the movie, after their headquarters are destroyed, the Kingsmen find new allies when they discover a spy organization in the   known as Statesman, who pose as cowboy whiskey manufacturers. And the names of the American agents seemed to have been picked straight out of a bar menu. You have   as the ‘token American’ Agent Tequila, a whip-cracking   as Agent Whiskey and Jeff Bridges’ Agent   as the grumpy head of Statesman. There is something for teetotallers, too, with gadget woman Halle Berry playing Ginger Ale. Villainous Julianne Moore’s name has ‘high’ potential, too – she is named Poppy! We wonder if anyone turned up inebriated on the sets, just to, you know, live up to their character names?
