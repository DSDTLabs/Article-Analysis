 "We have appealed to the people for their support. As soon as we reach a specific figure, we will pass the data to the MSRTC," Chougule said.
 
 About the Hinjewadi bus, Sanket Ghorpade, resident of Khutwadnagar, said, "Now I board the bus from my company stop and get down there in return journey. There is no waiting since the bus is available at the stop well in advance."
