NAGPUR:   was steadfast in her approach towards the agitations launched by Mahatma Gandhi not only in India but also in South Africa where they lived for a considerable period of time and supported her husband to the hilt through thick and thin, said  , former vice-chancellor of Nagpur University, on Wednesday. 

 Kedar, who delivered a lecture on the relevance of Kasturba Gandhi in this age of gender equality, said, though living in the shadow of the Mahatma, she established her own identity and undertook various initiatives that saw women come forward to take education and participate in India’s struggle for freedom from the Britishers.
 
 The lecture was organized to mark the birth anniversary of Kasturba Gandhi at  , Amravati Road. 
 
 Social worker   chaired the function while   was present on the occasion.
 
 Describing the journey of the Mahatma and Ba, Kedar said, “They were complementary to each other and her support was unflinching as she understood well the importance of non-violence which her husband preached.”
 
 The flame of raising a voice against the oppressive regime in South Africa was ignited in the mind of Gandhi when he was thrown out of the first class compartment of a train despite having a valid ticket. He was moved by the plight of the native Indians there and thus began the Mahatma’s experiment with ‘satyagrah’, Kedar added.
 
 Married women were given shabby treatment in the pre-independence era against which Kasturba took upon herself the responsibility of promoting education among them so that they could stand on their feet. She also undertook cleanliness campaigns, he said.
 
 Chitale said, “It is an irony that the society has been cowed down by some forces who turn violent at the drop of the hat. The society will have to change for betterment.”
 
 Vishakha Bagde also spoke. Later, monologues on Kasturba were presented by Mangala Sarode.
 
 Kalpana Upadhyay proposed a vote of thanks.
