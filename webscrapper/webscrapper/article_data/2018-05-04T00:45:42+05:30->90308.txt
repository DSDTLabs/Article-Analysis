Chennai:   has dispensed with the personal appearance of former union minister P Chidambaram’s wife and senior advocate  , son Karti Chidambaram and daughter-in-law Srinidhi before   authorities for inquiry under the   (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act.

 A vacation bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Seshasayee, before which the appeals filed by the Chidambarams came up for hearing on Thursday, however, directed the department to go ahead with the proceedings as per law.
 
 The appellants had said that a single judge had failed to note that the IT authorities were not honest or diligent in the discharge of their statutory duty and that the actions were politically motivated and vindictive.
 
 The issue pertains to notices issued by the I-T department to Chidambaram’s family for allegedly not disclosing overseas properties and bank accounts belonging to them. As the notices were also issued under the Black Money Act, the trio approached the high court to prohibit the department from sanctioning any prosecution under the Black Money Act.
 
 On April 21, a single judge directed the IT department to pass orders in accordance with the provisions of the Act within the time stipulated in it.
 
 Chess Global Advisory Services Private Limited, a company in which Karti is a director, has also approached the high court assailing notices issued by I-T department under the Black Money Act.
