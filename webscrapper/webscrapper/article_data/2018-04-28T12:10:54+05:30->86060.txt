MOHALI: Suspended   councillor Bobby   allegedly charged at MC Commissioner   after a verbal spat over removal of illegal structures from government land at the MC meeting on Friday. The intervention of other councillors and Mayor Kulwant Singh averted the physical dual.

 While discussing the issue of removing illegal constructions, Kamboj objected the move terming it ‘biased’ on the MC’s part. Pointing out at Hans, Kamboj said, “You have demolished the structure by pick-and-choose method. You should have razed all such illegal structures instead of singling one out.”
 
 Not taking the allegations in his stride, MC Commissioner replied it had to be started from somewhere. “If the MC team acts, it is a problem with councillors and if it does not, councillors still complain.”
 
 The discussion reached boiling point when Kamboj said the Commissioner was targeting BJP supporters, while Hans termed the allegations false and baseless. An agitated Kamboj then launched himself towards Hans saying, “Dassan Tainu” (Shall I tell you), to which Hans replied “Haan das” (yes tell me). Both stood up from their chairs and charged towards each other, but Mayor Kulwant Singh held the Commissioner back. Kamboj was pacified by other councillors at the meeting.
 
 Kamboj was opposing the removal of an illegal structure outside an industrial unit in phase IX which was razed by the MC.
 
 Survey of illegal structures
 
 MC Commissioner Sandeep Hans said he a survey will be conducted to identify encroachments on MC land. Following this, the MC will give the defaulters a 15-day notice period and if not complied with, the structures would be demolished.
