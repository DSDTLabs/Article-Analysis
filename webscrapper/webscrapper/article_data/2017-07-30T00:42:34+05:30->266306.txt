Mumbai: As   marketing companies have come across cases of residents not surrendering their cylinders after opting for a   connection, their officials are now reaching out to consumers and asking them to surrender their connection, take back deposits and collect a ‘safe custody transfer voucher.

 “I had an LPG cylinder, but after going for a piped gas connection, I have not surrendered the LPG to the gas distributor,” Umesh Kumar, a Thane resident, said. “This is because I fear that I may lose the connection for my residence permanently and not get a new connection, if required, in future. Also, the   is a back-up in case there is any problem with the piped gas.”
 
 An HPCL official clarified that when an LPG cylinder is surrendered back to the distributor, the connection is not permanently lost. 
 
 “When you return the cylinder, you get a ‘safe custody TV (transfer voucher) for piped gas consumers. This transfer voucher will ensure that your connection is still secure with us and you will have an option of taking LPG connection anytime, anywhere in the country in future.”
 
 You can also transfer the connection in the name of a close family relative.
 
 The facility of ‘safe custody transfer’ voucher is applicable to all consumers of Indane, Bharat Gas and HP Gas in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, said officials.
 
 “No charges will be levied for entrusting your LPG connection in our safe custody. All you need is to call your distributor who will send a representative. We have also advised your distributor to contact you to complete the following formalities,” the official said.
