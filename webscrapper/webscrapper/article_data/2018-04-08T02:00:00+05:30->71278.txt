PATNA: Apparently stung by media reports of illegal sex determination tests being conducted in the city, the Patna district administration on Saturday constituted 12 teams for the inspection of   centres in the district.

 The teams consist of administrative officials and doctors who will be helped by police in their drive. The district has been divided into different zones for the purpose.
 
 DM Kumar Ravi has directed the inspecting teams to submit their reports within a fortnight. He also directed Patna civil surgeon Dr Pramod Jha to ensure that all the 335 registered ultrasound facilities adhered to the provisions of Pre-Conception & Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.
 
 “Strict action will be taken against the ultrasound facilities that are found functioning without getting registered under the Act,” said Ravi.
 
 The administration’s move comes close on the heels of a TV news channel doing a sting operation that showed a Kankerbagh clinic and a bypass road nursing home reportedly conducting sex determination tests earlier this month. 
 
 The PCPNDT Act had banned sex determination and preconception sex-selection since 1994.
