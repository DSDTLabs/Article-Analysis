MUMBAI: A   and an   resident, who were part of a gang that duped people with a   lottery and job racket, were convicted to five years in jail last week. Police said most Nigerians arrested in such scams abscond once they get bail as they don’t have a permanent address here, and they often tear up their passports.

 The 47th metropolitan magistrate, A P Kulkarni, convicted Chima John Emannual Okereke and Harish Ramchandani under IPC sections for cheating, forgery, breach of trust, under 120B and under the Foreigner’s Act. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police said they were arrested in 2014.
 
 Though during investigations it transpired that the gang had duped several persons under the pretext of wining a lottery, offer to sell imported bikes cheap, compensation award and job  , in this case the complaint was filed by Abhilash Tuttil, a youth looking for a job through an online portal, and was duped by the duo. “While surfing the portal, Abhilash saw an advertisement for hotel staff. He applied, and within a few days he got call that he had been selected. A man called up Abhilash and told him to deposit Rs 31,250 for documentation and medical tests,” said an officer.
 
 Abhilash deposited the amount in an account and waited for several days, only to realise that he had been duped. He then lodged a police complaint. Police found that the mobile number through which the person had called Abhilash was registered in the name of Shabnam Ahmed. But he was unaware of any sim card in his name. Police then found the account in which the complainant deposited the money belonged to Ramchandani, who posed as Kishore Melwani. Police said Ramchandani was among many Indians who helped Nigerians in the scam. 
 
 Police came across several other bank transactions worth more than Rs 1 crore, indicating they have cheated many more.
