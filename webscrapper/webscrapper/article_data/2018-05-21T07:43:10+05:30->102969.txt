SECUNDERABAD: It’s end of ‘road woes’ for about 3.5 lakh motorists, who pass through the   (AOC) Centre in Secunderabad. The announcement by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) that all the closed roads in cantonments across the country will be reopened to the public has come as a major relief to the residents of colonies abutting the AOC Centre. Two arterial roads - Entrenchment and   - were scheduled for permanent closure from June 1. But now these two and other roads closed earlier will remain open to general traffic.

 
 About 10 lakh people live in colonies around AOC and 3.5 lakh motorists use the AOC Centre roads daily. This also brings down the curtain on the four years of uncertainty over the AOC roads.
 
 
  
 
 In Secunderabad Cantonment as many as 15 roads were closed for security reasons. Ten roads were closed more than a decade ago. Five roads were closed in 2014. Two of these roads, however, remained open during the day. Now all the roads will be reopened.
 
 MoD’s decision will be of great help to women employees, who return home after 10pm from offices. “Thanks to Nirmala Sitharaman, I will now reach home early. I need not take a long route to reach home,” said  , senior manager,  , and resident of Sitaram Nagar.
 
 D Sravya Sahithi, an engineering student and resident of  , said it is a big relief. “I have been fighting against the closure of roads ever since I became an MP. All civilian roads will be kept open now. My efforts have yielded fruits,” said Malkajgiri MP Ch Malla Reddy while thanking defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
