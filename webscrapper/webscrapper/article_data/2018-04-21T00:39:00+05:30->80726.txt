You are most likely to miss the food cart opposite West Boulevard Road as it is partly hidden behind a huge crowd thronging it every evening for their delectable vaazhai poo (banana flower) samosa.

 Though the cart run by K Mohamed does not even have a name board, it has a rich history and reputation. It is one of the desired destinations for food enthusiasts for five decades.
 
 At least 250 people visit the eatery every day for their samosas and vaazhai poo vadai. The snacks are aptly served with tasty mint chutney. In fact, the vadais and samosas are prepared non-stop at the cart since they are immediately sold out once placed on the tray. Both vadai and samosa are priced at Rs 5 per piece.
 
 Mohamed is the third generation owner of the food cart, which was launched by his grandfather 50 years ago. "Once I was handed over the cart, my first target was to experiment with the snack items that were served. I brought a twist to the conventional samosas by using vaazhai poo and onion as stuffing instead of the normal potato and onion," Mohamed said, adding that he chose vaazhai poo because of its health benefits.
 
 Since both wheat and maida flours are mixed in equal proportions for making the dough, the crispiness is very good, said the 50-year-old. "The mint chutney, which is served with the snacks, is loved by everyone," he said.
 
 Though the cart is operates only from 5 pm to 8.30 pm in the evenings, work starts at 5 am for Mohamed. "I go to Gandhi Market and purchase vegetables since I use only fresh ingredients and never use leftovers," he said. The preparation for the stuffing begins at 10 am and goes on up to 3 pm.
 
 When asked on why he restricted the menu to only two varieties of snack items, Mohamed said that he didn’t want to take the risk and compromise on quality. "I have only one helper and if I get greedy and add more snack items, to increase profit, I would end up losing my customers since it is impossible to maintain the same quality," he stated.
 
 The cart owner also said that he had no plans of expanding his business. "I believe in minimalistic lifestyle. And it’s no different when it comes to my business too," he said with a philosophical note.
