NEW DELHI: The   has paved the way for top colleges in the country to get autonomous status that will empower them to start their own courses, award degrees, conduct examinations and make appointments, among other things. The commission notified the regulations to this effect on Tuesday. 

 It says colleges with a ranking of 3.51 and above in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council’s 4-point scale will be considered for grant of autonomous status for 10 years without an on-site visit by an expert committee. 
 
 With this, the institutions will get the freedom to start diploma (undergraduate and postgraduate) or certificate courses as well as new undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD programmes without prior approvals from the university or the regulatory authority. 
 
 The colleges will also be allowed to restructure and redesign the syllabus to suit local needs. The autonomous status will empower the colleges to announce results, issue mark sheets, migration and other certificates. However, the degree shall be awarded by the university with the name of the college on the degree certificate. 
 
 The changes were contained in the HRD ministry’s gazette notification – University Grants Commission (Conferment of Autonomous Status Upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations, 2018. Under the provision of Section 2(f) of the   Act, colleges of any discipline, whether aided, partially aided and unaided/ self-financing are now eligible to seek autonomy. 
 
 Autonomous colleges need not pay affiliation fee to the parent university every year. One-time fee can be paid at the time of conferment of autonomous status. They shall also have complete administrative autonomy. 
 
 Colleges which have a   score of 3.26 and above, up to 3.50 or a corresponding   score or a corresponding accreditation grade/ score from a UGC empanelled accreditation agency, too shall be considered for grant of autonomy for six years.
