NEW DELHI: Eyeing the Poorvanchali vote pie, and sensing stiff contest for it, AAP has fielded 36 Poorvanchali candidates for the forthcoming civic polls. 

 The community has been an AAP stronghold for a while, and both BJP and Congress have been trying to make inroads. BJP has fielded 32 Poorvanchalis, while Congress has considered them too. 
 
 AAP has given tickets to its Poorvanchali workers in Burari, Badarpur, Badli, Matiala and east Delhi. “These 36 candidates have been working among Poorvanchalis for long and are quite popular in their respective areas,” said AAP’s Delhi convenor, Dilip Pandey. He along with Sanjay Singh, Sanjeev Jha, Somnath Bharti, and ministers Gopal Rai and Kapil Mishra would be the star campaigners for AAP in these areas. 
 
 “Since the time of the anti-corruption movement, Poorvanchalis have been the backbone of the party. It was AAP that had first raised the issues of Poorvanchalis; other parties woke up to their demands much later,” said AAP member Ashish Talwar. 
 
 The people in these areas are also the biggest beneficiaries of the AAP government’s water and electricity subsidies. The party would try to highlight its achievements in government while seeking votes. The state BJP, too, led by Manoj Tiwari, himself a Poorvanchali, has been claiming to be the closest to the Poorvanchalis. Looks like a tough contest is coming.
