NAGPUR: India had their first tour to   way back in 1992-93. However, it took them 14 years to record their first Test victory on South African soil. The Rahul Dravid-led side recorded an 87-run win in the Johannesburg Test in 2006. Incidentally, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar was the chairman of the selectors then. 

 In the city for an engagement, the former India batsman felt a few practice games were necessary for India before the first Test against South Africa. "India should have played a few practice matches to adapt better," Vengsarkar said. 
 
 Although India are on the backfoot, Vengsarkar said they will perform better in the second innings and in the coming Tests. "They will improve from here on. Now that they have got the feel of the wicket, they will perform better. The match is still wide open."
 
 While he praised India's dominance at home, he termed the recent Sri Lanka series 'unnecessary.' "As India had already played a series against Sri Lanka in Lanka, the recent series played on the Indian soil was unnecessary."
