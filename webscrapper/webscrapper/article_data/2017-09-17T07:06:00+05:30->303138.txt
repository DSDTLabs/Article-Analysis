Ludhiana: As the residents had barely adjusted to the hike in   prices, increase in cost of vegetables has disturbed their house budgets. Every day hike in coal, petrol and diesel prices have had a drastic affect on vegetable market not only in the city but throughout the country and the upcoming festival season will add to the burden.

 “Now with the arrival of festival season, commission agents will start hoarding vegetables and fruits to earn huge profits,” said Ramu Parsad, one of the vegetable vendors at city’s main vegetable market located near Jalandhar bypass.
 
 “Moreover, this year has brought lots of challenges for the farmers with many having lost their produce due to heavy rainfall or drought,” he added. 
 
 Another whole-seller of vegetables Vijander Singh told TOI, “Most of the vegetables prices have been hiked by around 25%. Onions, tomatoes and peas have going out of bounds of the middle class families. Moreover, due to hike in petroleum products in recent days, prices of vegetables that are transported from different states have surged. Apart from this, in the forthcoming days prices of tomato is set to rise further as the new crop has been affected by flood in parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.”
 
 Meanwhile, the residents are finding to balance their household budget in the wake of rising prices of vegetables.
 
 “Both Union and state governments should do extensive checking of big cold storage rooms in vegetables markets where the commission agents have hoarded most of the vegetables to sell them later at higher prices. With most of the vegetables costing about Rs 100 per kilo is difficult to afford by a daily wager,” Anita Kumari, a home maker from Model Town, said.
 
 Gurpreet Kaur, a resident of Tagore Nagar, said, “Prices of cauliflower, okra, and peas are still out of the reach of the common man and these are adversely affecting the house budgets. If things continue like this then it will put a dampener on the upcoming festive season.”
