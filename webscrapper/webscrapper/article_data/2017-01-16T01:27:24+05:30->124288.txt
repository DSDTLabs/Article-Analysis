Lucknow: A day after a crucial part of landing system at   snapped, forcing many   to   to be  , a morning flight landed at Chaudhary Charan Singh airport on Sunday. This was made possible by late night repair of the high frequency omni directional range (DVOR) that helps incoming aircraft with safe landing.

 The DVOR had snapped around 4.30 pm on Saturday which led to cancellation of 20 flights to Lucknow. 
 
 “We bought the part of instrument landing system (ILS) from Kanpur and Delhi and around 12.30 am on Sunday, our engineering teams fixed the DVOR,” said Lucknow airport director PK Srivastava.
 
 Passengers arriving on different flights said it was around 1.30 am when an announcement was made about the departure of their flights for Lucknow. “There was no clear information as to when my flight will eventually leave for Lucknow. So I decided to wait at the airport and around 2am, I learnt about when my flight will take off for Lucknow,” said Sakshi Malhotra who arrived on the Delhi flight.
 
 “When the announcement was made at Delhi airport, I was heartbroken as I had to attend Makar Sankranti party my siblings had planned for Saturday which I missed,” said Ashutosh Ahluwalia, another passenger.
 
 “UP elections are round the corner so when a colleague called to tell me that the flight to Lucknow has been cancelled, I was stunned. It left me wondering what could have happened in the capital city...later I read online that that the operation was hampered due to some technical issues,” said Rajiv Saxena who had to attend a meeting in Lucknow which he didn’t have to miss as the service was restored.
