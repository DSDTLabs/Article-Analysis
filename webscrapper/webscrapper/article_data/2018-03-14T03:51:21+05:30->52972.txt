NEW DELHI: The capital might see thunderstorm and light rainfall on Thursday leading to a marginal dip in temperature. But the relief may be brief as the mercury is likely to rise from Friday and is expected to hover around 35 degrees Celsius, the Regional Meteorological Centre said.

 A western disturbance is approaching Jammu and Kashmir, which is likely to cause rainfall over J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and northern Punjab on Thursday. There will also be ‘isolated rainfall’ in Haryana and thunderstorm in Delhi as well. Temperature might fall by 1 or 2 degrees Celsius on Thursday but rise again from Friday. “Till May, max temperature will be 1 to 1.5 degrees above normal almost all the time,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, director at Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. 
 
 The maximum temperature has been above normal by 3 to 4 degrees for the past few days. “This is mainly because the air is dry and there is clear sky. There has been no rainfall in the plains and hills leading to less moisture in the air,” added Shrivastava. 
 
 The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 36.2 degrees Celsius, 7 degrees above normal while the minimum was17.1 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees above normal.
