THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A meeting of higher officials in the transport department held to review the recommendations made by Supreme Court committee on road safety has decided to direct the motor vehicles department to suspend the licenses of traffic rule violators. The meeting chaired by transport secretary K R Jyothilal decided to implement the decision immediately.

 As per the data available with the MVD, 1,62,623 offences have been detected from October 1, 2016 to May 25, 2017. Of this, the highest number of offenders belonged to the category of speeding (1,21,669).
 
 But the motor vehicles department is in a dilemma over the practical side of implementing this directive, as the most of the cases, especially speeding, have been detected by the cameras. In the case of speeding, while the manual detection was 4,718 cases, the cameras detected 1,16,951cases. Sources said that as the cameras could detect only the registration number of vehicles, fin ding out who drove the vehicle itself would be a Herculean task, because the registered owner of the vehicle need not be the driver.
 
 In such cases, the de partment would have to issue notices to the vehi cle owner, ask them to ap pear before the officials, find out who drove the vehicle and then su spend the license of the offender. At present, the speeding cases are slapped a fine which alone earned the government Rs 99 crore in the last one year.
