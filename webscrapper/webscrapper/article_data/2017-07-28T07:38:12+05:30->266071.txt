 Residents, largely from the Forest-Trails Society, formed a human chain and staged a dharna to highlight the problems they face. “Commuting has become a big issue. Despite repeated requests to the authorities concerned, no action has been taken,” said Vinit Tainaikar, a local resident.
 
 Those living in the vicinity added that they have urged the authorities to allow them to repair the road but they were not given the permissions. “The intensity of the problems increases on weekends as the road gets clogged due to commuters heading towards popular tourist spots. We are left with no option but to wait for hours while the traffic is cleared,” said Shalini Singh, another local resident.
 
 Singh added that steps such as permanent deployment of traffic police, three-lane traffic movement and installation of street lights should be taken up on priority. “The law and order situation is also a cause for concern,” she said. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ashok Morale said that citizens’ concerns would be considered. “We have been carrying out action in these areas. The traffic department will turn its focus on controlling weekend traffic,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) officials said that the plan to improve the road infrastructure is in the pipeline. “The plan includes improvement of road quality and road-widening across the PMR region,” said a senior PMRDA official.
