NASHIK: In order to rope in airline operators to commence air services from here, the Nashik Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (NIMA) has offered a loyalty programme.

 The apex body of industries has said that it will sign a loyalty programme with the airline operator that is first to commence   from Nashik. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, NIMA president, H S Banerjee said, “We are making all the efforts to commence air service from here. We have already decided to offer a loyalty programme to the airline operators and offered the opportunity the airline operators like Air India and   during a meeting we recently had with the state government. We will sign the loyalty programme with the company which first commences air service.”
 
 Under the loyalty programme, the industries will book a few seats to make the air service viable. “We will share some seats, but the ratio will be decided before we sign the loyalty offer with the concerned operator. After conducting a survey of air service potentials in Nashik, we have found that there can be flights to Bangalore and Delhi from here.” Banerjee said. 
 
 The Kingfisher airlines had shut their Nashik-Mumbai air service after a year-long operation in November 2009 following poor response. Seven years later, the air service is yet to commence here. 
 
 The state government along with the   Ltd developed the new airport terminal at a cost of Rs 84 crore in 2014.
 
 Recently, Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India did propose a Nashik-Mumbai flight in May, but the airport terminal operator GVK denied giving slots for the proposed flights. Finally, the subsidiary grounded its service. 
 
 Now, Nashik has been included under the central government’s regional connectivity scheme and is in the bidding process, which is expected to be finished by January. The fate of Nashik’s air service will be clear by January-end.
