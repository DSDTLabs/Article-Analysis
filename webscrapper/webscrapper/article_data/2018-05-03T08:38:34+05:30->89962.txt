VARANASI: The Lanka police on Tuesday lodged an   against Banaras Hindu University (BHU) chief proctor   and 25 others following an order of chief judicial magistrate. 

 Ashish Kumar Singh of Naria had filed an application under section 156/3 of CrPC at the CJM court alleging that the chief proctor had assaulted him, his family members and looted articles. 
 
 Subsequently, the court on April 11 asked the Lanka police to lodge an FIR and investigate the allegations.
 
  Sanjiv Mishra said the FIR has been lodged against 26 persons, including the chief proctor, under various sections including 147, 148, 307, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. The matter is being probed. In his application submitted before CJM court, Ashish had alleged that on March 7 the chief proctor along with chief security officer Sansar Singh, security guard Lal Babu Patel and 24 unidentified proctorial board personnel raided the timber shop of his father in Naria area. 
 
 He alleged that Sansar Singh had also opened fire. The CJM court ordered on April 11 that such acts were not part of the duty of the proctorial board and directed the Lanka police to lodge an FIR. However, when the Lanka police failed to ensure compliance of the order, the CJM court on April 30 took a serious note and asked the Inspector Lanka to appear personally before it on May 4. This led to lodging of the FIR the very next day on May 1.
