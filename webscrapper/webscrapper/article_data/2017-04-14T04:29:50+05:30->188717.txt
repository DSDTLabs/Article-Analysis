NEW DELHI: On the back of a public outcry, HRD minister   called the description of a “perfect female body” in a Class XII textbook used in many   schools as “sexist” while ordering action against the private publisher which has since decided to stop the printing of the book.

 Excerpts from ‘Health and Physical Education’, by Dr V K Sharma, defining “36-24-36” as the “best body shape for females” went viral on social media on Wednesday. “I condemn the remarks in the book as sexist. The text is non-defensible and unacceptable. I have instructed the officers to take appropriate action,” said Javadekar.
 
 “We have taken strong exception to the news that a book for Class XII students has some sexist remarks ... This is not an NCERT book, neither it is an NCF compliant book. It is a private publisher’s book and the matter is going to be probed,” he said.
