BHOPAL: A day after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan expressed disappointment over a strike by teachers, seeking hike in wages, the state government on Tuesday announced the enforcement of Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) for teachers associated with coming board examinations.

 Highly placed sources in education department told TOI that the order was passed on Tuesday to all the employees who are slated to be on duty during board examinations. “Employees of education department, including teachers and principals, were informed that ESMA will be in force from February, 1. The order was passed by general administrative department (GAD) on Tuesday,” sources said. According to sources, for over three months from February 1, no employee associated with board exams can avail leave until the result is declared. Sources said the orders have been issued after teachers threatened to proceed on strike, if their wages are not hiked. A few days ago, Chouhan had expressed surprise over demand of teachers and said during a cabinet meet that despite having increased wages of over 35000 teachers they are still hitting the streets, which is not good.
 
 Speaking to TOI, PRO   AK Chourasia confirmed the move and said, “Education department has been informed about it and the notice will also be uploaded on MP online portal.”
 
  Principals asked to help students:   of Secondary Education (MPBSE) has sought support from principals of all government schools and has asked them to take ‘remedial classes’ to enhance performance of their students in the board examination.“We have been asked to take remedial classes. It is a good initiative to imporove results. Board has asked all principals to impart education to students of higher secondary and high school in the remedial classes,” said Sham Renawal, principal, Model School TT Nagar.
