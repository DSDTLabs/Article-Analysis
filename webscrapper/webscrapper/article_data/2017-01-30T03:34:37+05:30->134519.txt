 While the first draw of lots will be conducted for 14 oustees of   on SPR on January 30, another draw for oustees of NPR is likely in the first week of February.
 
 The move will help expedite work on the remaining portions of SPR and NPR, which have been stuck for the last six months due to various litigations.
 
 Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said the authorities would try to vacate the required land by February to complete the projects at the earliest. The speedy completion of these roads will improve connectivity in new Gurgaon and reduce traffic congestion on NH-8, providing a relief to around 1.5 lakh people who have invested in hundreds of projects along SPR and NPR.
 
 “We are completing the formalities,” he said, adding that in case of the NPR project, the draw would be conducted only for non-GPA, non-SPA holders. Therefore, only those oustees, who have proper property documents and constructed houses on the land acquired for the project, would be part of the draw.
 
 Sources said around 560 people affected by the NPR project had applied for alternative plots, out of which around 270 were given plots in the last draw held in July-August 2016. In the fresh draws, around 220 oustees (non-GPA, non-SPA holders) would get alternative plots.
 
 “The fresh draw for SPR, NPR oustees would be conducted in accordance with the FTS, under which oustees will get alternative plots equivalent to the ground coverage of their constructed residential houses,” said Yadav.
