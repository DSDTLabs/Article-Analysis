After a short hiatus, yet another horror-comedy is in the offing.  , which has Jiiva and Sri Divya in the lead roles, has Radikaa, Radha Ravi, Soori and   in pivotal roles. Directed by debutant Ike, the film has   composing music for it. The film’s album has Simbu,  , Anirudh Ravichander,   and Premgi Amaren, etc.

 Vishal opens up, “It was the mutual admiration which brought many people on board to lend their voice for different songs. Each song in the movie is distinct and enhances the mood of the film. The song Kattaduraikku which has been crooned by Gangai Amaren has an ‘Ilaiyaraaja touch’ as its composition and arrangements remind some of the legend’s works. Hai, En Kai Mela, which has Anirudh and Shakthisree Gopalan, is a melody. In fact, this song is my pick in the album. Every number except the title song has a fusion of folk genre especially because the story is set against the backdrop of Palani.” 
 
 He says that the way sound has been used in the movie is quite different from the usual horror-comedy films. “When Ike narrated the script to me, we decided to come up with a unique pattern which is followed in Hollywood films like The Conjuring. The audience, too, will experience it once they watch the film,” Vishal adds.
