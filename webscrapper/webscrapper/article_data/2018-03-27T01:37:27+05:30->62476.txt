GURUGRAM: The   for fiscal year 2018-19 will see a hike of around 25-30% over last year, said sources. Final discussions on this year’s budget, which has already been prepared and sent to the commissioner for approval, are scheduled for today.   chief Yashpal Yadav said it will most likely be presented to the House later this week for approval. 

 “In all likelihood, the budget will be 25-30% higher. But, since it hasn’t been approved yet, final numbers may vary,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity. That means, with last year’s budget being Rs 1,425 crore, this year’s can be expected to be around Rs 1,782 crore. Officials said, barring the two industrial sectors, transfer of all   sectors to the corporation is bound to increase MCG expenses.
 
 However, transfer of services like water and sewage to GMDA should also offset some of its financial burden. The official said they are expecting the budget to be approved by this week, that they are already running behind schedule given it’s already the last week of March.
 
 How the corporation utilises the funds even with a revised budget, though, remains to be seen, as in the past, MCG has often been criticised for misusing its funds. Just a few months ago, it had loaned Rs 500 crore to GMDA to build master services. 
 
 This was taken up in subsequent House meetings, with councillors saying the money should have been used for internal development of sectors instead. Moreover, in the last five years, MCG has also loaned Rs 164 crore to Municipal Corporation of  , which is yet to be recovered.
 
 Till November 2017, TOI had reported that three quarters into the current financial, MCG had spent only 40% of the Rs 836 crore it had budgeted for development work in the city.
