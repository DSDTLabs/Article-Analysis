LUCKNOW: With LMC ready to install about 40   (point-of-sale terminals) across its various departments this week, you would be able to pay your municipal dues, including taxes, parking fee, arrears and towing penalties through plastic money from January 23.

 The decision comes close on the heels of demonetisation which forced   to look for more convenient ways of collection from people. The LMC approached two leading private banks for swipe machines for its cash counters. The plan was worked out a month ago.While the LMC's all eight zonal offices would have two swipe machines each, departments like rent collection, health and sanitation, road cutting, veterinary, engineering and accounts would have one swipe machine each.
 
 LMC's zonal officer Ashok Singh said, “The towing cranes of Hazratganj, Charbagh, Mahanagar, Gomtinagar and Indiranagar will be provided with one swipe machine each to immediately charge penalty from parking defaulters. They would have to pay instantly through their credit debit cards.“
 
 Even LMC's authorised parking at zoo and three basement parking facilities -at Jhandewala in Aminabad, Jhandiwala parking in Lalbagh and Dayanidhan near Lalbagh crossing -would get one machine each.
 
 People would also be able to pay the parking fee through their cards. “This would completely do away with the problem of producing the exact amount for the contractor,“ said Singh.Though machines would be operational from next week, people would be allowed to pay in cash till the time they become well-versed with the online payment mechanism and plastic money usage.
