LONDON: A British member of the   offered his resignation at the despatch box because he arrived late to the chamber.

 According to CNN, International Development Minister and former Conservative MP  , who was meant to be in the House of Lords chamber for the start of oral questions at 15:00 GMT said, "I'm thoroughly ashamed at not being in my place and therefore I shall be offering my resignation to the Prime Minister with immediate effect. I do apologize."
 
 "I wonder if you permit me to offer my sincere apologies to Baroness Lister for my discourtesy in not being in my place to answer her question on a very important matter," Lord Bates said shortly after arriving at his place.
 
 Peers urged him in vain not to go, and Labour's leader in the Lords said an apology would have sufficed. Peers cried "no" as he walked past them on his way out of the chamber, leaving puzzled looks in his wake.
 
 Opposition leader in the House of Lords,  , stated, "An apology is sufficient for a minor discourtesy."
 
 However, British prime minister   rejected Bates' resignation dubbing it as "unnecessary."
 
 "His resignation was refused as it was judged this was unnecessary. As a hard-working and diligent minister, it is typical of his approach that he takes his responsibilities to Parliament so seriously," a spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said.
