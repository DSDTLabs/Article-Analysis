REDDIGUNTA BADAVA (CHITTOOR) : Throwing a spanner in the works of the TDP-BJP alliance in  , YSR   chief Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday said that his party is ready to align with the   if the NDA government grants the Special Category Status ( ) to  .

 “Our stand has been very clear. We have been insisting on SCS. It was promised to the people by both the ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP. But after coming to power, for reasons best known to (CM) Chandrababu Naidu, SCS has taken a back seat. Deprived of such a status, AP cannot compete with cities like Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. The infrastructure to match these cities cannot be provided unless there is SCS. Why would anybody come and invest in AP where there is no infrastructure? This is the reason we are very particular about the SCS,” Jagan said in an interview to a private TV channel after taking a break from his padayatra here on Monday.
 
 On a specific question whether he would support the BJP in the next election, Jagan said: “SCS is a promise. Prime Minister Modi has the authority to give SCS with the stroke of a pen. If BJP grants SCS, I am willing to support the BJP.”
 
 On another question about the corruption cases pending against him, the YSR Congress leader said that the cases were the conspiracy of the Congress and TDP. “Congress MLA P Shankar Rao filed the petition and later became aminister. Now, CM Chandrababu Naidu was caught offering money (in the cash for vote case) and no action is taken against him. Can this happen to a common man?” he asked.
