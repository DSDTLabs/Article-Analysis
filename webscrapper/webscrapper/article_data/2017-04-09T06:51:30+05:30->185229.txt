HYDERABAD: The  , Telangana & Odisha will soon embark on a   awareness campaign with oral triple talaq and reconciliation being primary areas of focus.

 According to Jamaat-e-Islami, Telangana & Odisha president, Hamid Mohammed Khan, the campaign will begin on April 23 and end on May 17.
 
 “We are going to spread awareness at 300 locations, including the city and others towns like Huzurabad, among many others across the state.These include both rural and urban areas. The activity will be done at the grassroots level and will involve explaining the basics of Muslim personal laws and also advising against their misuse,“ Hamid Mohammad Khan said.
 
 Touching upon the subject of divor ce within the Muslim community, Khan said that there is a misconception within the some sections of the community that oral triple talaq is the only method of divorce available. The campaign seeks to dispel this notion. “There is a lack of awareness among some people with regards to divorce. They don't know that there are other kinds of talaq such as talaq-e-rajai'i (revocable talaq). There is talaq-eahsan, which has Quranic sanction, and talaq-e-hasan.Talaq-e-biddah, which is irrevocable, is most undesired,“ he said. The Jamaat will spread awareness about the methods or arbitration and steps that can be taken so that the husband and wife can come to a reconciliation. “Arbitration can be done by sitting with elders or scholars of Islam.They can approach the Darul Qaza and also trained counsellors. We first spread awareness that marriages should be saved and this can be done by spouses trying to understand each other,“ Khan said.
 
 The campaign will have on board scholars of Islam as well as others who are well versed with Muslim personal laws, and members of the community. In the recent past, faith leaders including noted cleric Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani have said that oral triple talaq in one sitting is a sin.
