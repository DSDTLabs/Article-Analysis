AHMEDABAD: Amid increased demand from sectors such as e-commerce, retail, consumer durables, FMCG and manufacturing,   in Ahmedabad is greatly gaining traction. Warehouse space of more than 3 million square feet (sq ft) was transacted in Ahmedabad in 2017, against 2 million sq ft in 2016, states a report by real estate consultant Knight Frank.

 According to the India Warehousing Market Report 2018, most of the warehousing is concentrated in the Aslali-Kheda and   belt. Additionally, Sanand has also been attracting interest from warehouse developers over the last few years, but is still a relatively small market compared to the other two locations.
 
 “After GST (goods and services tax) the Ahmedabad market recorded a staggering 86% growth as companies who were in wait-and-watch mode have moved to execution mode. We are witnessing consolidation and expansion of warehousing space for the first time,” said Balbir Singh Khalsa, national director of industrial and asset services,  .
 
 “The increase in demand is from sectors such as e-commerce, retail, consumer durables, FMCG and manufacturing. Coupled with the requirement for larger warehouses, this has opened up the field for more organized players. Going forward, we expect the trend to continue and get better,” he added.
