GURUGRAM: Residents of   woke up to thick clouds of   spreading across the area on Monday morning. They alleged that some unknowm persons had set mounds of waste dumped illegally in a green belt on fire, right in the heart of the city. The flames charred trees in the vicinity and turned greenery in a 60sqft area to ashes.

 There are around 1,000 residential houses in this upscale area, which is near the arterial Rezang La Chowk — along which thousands of vehicles commute every day.
 
 Residents alleged that private contractors hired by MCG set the waste on fire. “Not only do these contractors dump waste in this green belt illegally, they irresponsibly put the entire mountain of   on fire,” said Col Mahavir Yadav, a resident. “I go out for a stroll every morning, but today, the entire area was engulfed by massive smoke. I went near the spot and saw huge flames burning trees, leaves and the foliage around. It was with great difficultly that I stood there and videographed the incident so that I have evidence of what the authorities are doing.”
 
 The National Green Tribunal had in 2016 banned waste burning, announcing a fine of Rs 25,000 per violation. Many expressed their concerns about the fumes creating breathing problems for the ailing. “I felt a sting on the back of my throat when I opened the window. Is this legal? To burn trash, that too in such proximity to a respectable society in the Gurugram? What is MCG doing? Have they outsourced their work to irresponsible people?” fumed Sharda, another resident. “If these people had fear of law, they would never have done it,” Yadav said.
 
  MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said the corporation has already passed orders to impose stricter punishments on violators. Asked if any action would be taken in this case, he said: “Now that it has been brought to my notice, yes. We will take the strictest action possible against those found guilty.”
