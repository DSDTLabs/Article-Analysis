GURUGRAM: Winter has only just started receding and the problem of power outages has yet again come to the fore. 

 Power supply in New   will be cut for five hours on Saturday owing to maintenance work at the Daulatabad power house. Officials from the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) said that transformer no. 2 supplying power to as many as six feeders will be shut down for the purpose. Areas including Raj Nath, Surat Nagar, Dhanwapur village, Vishnu garden and Dharampur village will be without electricity from10am till 3pm on Saturday.
 
 “Directions have been given by   officials . We want consumers to be informed about the shutdown,” said SDO New Palam Vihar.
 
 But residents feel that these long outages they have to suffer from in the wake of maintenance work during winters did not make much sense. They said it was rather a norm of the power department to cut power supply on one pretext or the other. “There are at least 3 to 4 outages in a week. During rains, power supply is cut off for 8-9 hours at a stretch,” said Shiv Prakash Dubey, a resident of Surat Nagar.
 
 HVPNL officials, however, said the power house was shutting down the transformer because of annual maintenance. “The yearly maintenance is mandatory for all power equipment,” said Anil Yadav, superintendent engineer, HVPNL. “I will request officials to scale down the period of shutdown.” Yadav said the work was necessary to ensure that transformers are ready before summer.
