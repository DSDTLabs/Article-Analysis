NASHIK: Farmers from Dindori and Niphad talukas have accused the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( ) of providing them with faulty energy bills.

 They alleged that the power utility has resorted to average billing, rather than charging them for the actual power consumed and as reflected in their meters.
 
 “The MSEDCL has issued bills to us in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 40,000 on an average. This despite we having metered agriculture connections. We have decided to pay the amount equivalent to average consumption. We want the farmers be compensated with Rs 200 a month as stated under Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) violation by Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC),” said  , a   from the village Materewadi of Dindori taluka.
 
 The farmers from Materawadi, Lokhandewadi, Rajapur, Gopegaon and Jopul villages in Dindori taluka alleged that their are getting average bills for the past ten years and they want the MSEDCL to provide them with the metered bills. The farmers get power supply from Pimpalgaon (B) sub divisional office of Nashik Urban Circle.
 
 There are around 10,000 farmers under its sub-division and more than half of them have metered installed. But the company has failed to give them metered energy bills. 
 
 “The problem is that the company failed to give metered energy bills even to those who demand for the same, forget the others. In such case farmers have now decided to ensure that there is a system in place which will ensure justice to farmers,” farmer Sunil Pundalik Jadhav said.
 
 The aggrieved farmers – about 30 in numbers – have registered their complaint under section 56 of the Electricity Act and paid only the average amount to be charged for the consumption every trimester.
 
 “There are some issues that the farmers have raised. We have received the complaints and will take corrective measures if needed,” an MSEDCL officer said.
