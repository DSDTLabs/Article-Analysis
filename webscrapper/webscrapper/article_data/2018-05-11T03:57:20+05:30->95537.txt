NEW DELHI: The Anti-Corruption Branch ( ) of Delhi government on Thursday arrested CM Arvind Kejriwal’s nephew in an alleged   scam. The accused,Vinay Bansal, is the son of Kejriwal’s late brother-in-law, Surender Bansal, who was a PWD contractor. He died away last year. 

 
 Vinay was produced in court and remanded to judicial custody for a day. The case pertains to alleged irregularities in the grant of contracts for roads and sewer lines in Delhi. One Rahul Sharma from an NGO, Roads Anti Corruption Organisation (RACO), had filed a complaint against  , Surender, proprietor of a construction firm, unknown public servants and others. 
 
 Last year, the ACB filed three FIRs, of which one was against   —owned by Surender. The other two firms being probed are owned by one Pawan Kumar and Kamal Singh. Bansal’s firm had been awarded a contract to build a drainage system in northwest Delhi’s Bakoli village in April 2015. Sharma had alleged that the work was not completed and that PWD was sent “false and fabricated” bills. 
 
 The FIR in the alleged PWD scam says the estimated budget for the work — which is what PWD paid — was Rs 4,90,36,843 whereas Renu Constructions submitted a bid for Rs 2,64,50,473. The cops alleged PWD made extra payment. The FIR also states that steel and cement were procured from unknown sources and hence their quality could not be verified.
 
 Among other allegations is that the delivery challans for the grade concrete were not available in the records. ACB sources said more arrests were likely in the case as some PWD officials are also under the scanner. ACB officials defended the Vinay’s arrest, saying he had not been cooperating in the probe. They also alleged that Vinay had been giving contradictory answers to many questions. He had allegedly claimed he was not an active partner in the firm but this was not true. The cops claim they have verified this through records.
