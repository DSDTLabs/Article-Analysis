It’s been four years since her debut, and   is already working on her 28th film — that is how much in-demand this young actress is. The last time we saw her in a Kannada film was back in 2015, when she did a cameo in Sidhartha… Give me a break. She is all set to enthrall audiences once again in this week’s release, #O Premave.   tells us about her memories of the film (she shot for it four years ago), her journey so far, and why she can’t wait to do another Kannada film…

 
 She’s an upper middle-class girl, who wishes and dreams to live like a princess. She does not know how to prioritize between something materialistic and love. For her, it’s about having it all. But as the movie progresses, she realizes how important love really is, and the value of relationships over materialistic things.
 
 
 I remember that we shot in a lot of places, such as Switzerland, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Mysuru and a couple of other places. When we were shooting in   for the song  , it was -5°C, and while the hero,  , was dressed up in layers of clothing, I was in a thin gown. I clearly remember the shoot because I was freezing (laughs). But I am glad that the song has shaped up very well.
 
 
 I hope that audiences will really like this story. It is a love story for the youth and youngsters can learn a lot from the film. I wish Manoj all the best, as it is his first film as a hero.

 Any fond memories from the shoot?
 I remember that we shot in a lot of places, such as Switzerland, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Mysuru and a couple of other places. When we were shooting in Switzerland for the song Gari Gedari, it was -5°C, and while the hero, Manoj, was dressed up in layers of clothing, I was in a thin gown.

 What are your expectations from the movie?

 So, will we be seeing more of you in Sandalwood?
 I will be back very soon. I moved to Chennai around three years ago, so I can’t wait to be back in Bengaluru, which is my home. And at least that way my parents will complain less, because I will be able to spend time with them (laughs).
