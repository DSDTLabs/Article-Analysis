Trichy: A drunken bus driver put the lives of 30 students on board and motorists on the road a scare on Thursday with his rash driving. The college bus with the students hit an auto rickshaw carrying a family of five and sped away, but was chased down by motorists as it was being driven in a haphazard manner.

 The driver identified as Thirunavukarasu, 43, from Allur, was found to be driving the bus under the influence of alcohol which was confirmed by a medical test. He has been booked under various sections for endangering personal safety of others.
 
 The bus was operated by K Ramakrishnan College of Engineering at Samayapuram. The bus picked up the students from Woraiyur at around 8am.
 
 Moving in haphazard manner, the bus hit an auto rickshaw with passengers near Natchiyar temple. Even though the incident left one of the woman passenger in the auto rickshaw injured, the bus sped from the spot. 
 
 Irked over the incident, the auto rickshaw driver chased the bus. A few in motorcycles too chase the bus.
 
 The bus was waylaid by commuters near Rukmani theatre. Finding the driver to be in an inebriated state, he was handed over to the Trichy north traffic investigation wing. 
 
 Inspector from Trichy north traffic investigation wing Ramakrishnan confirmed that the medical examination revealed the driver was drunk. 
 
 Apart from being booked for drunken driving, cases have been registered under section 279 and 337 of the IPC against Thirunavukkarasu for rash driving or riding on a public way and causing hurt by endangering life or personal safety of others. 
 
 An official from the college said that it may not be possible to check every driver before the start of a trip. “It’s a first of its kind incident in the past one decade. Buses start from various points in and around Trichy and it may not be possible to check every driver,” said Ilangovan, in-charge of bus operations at the college.
