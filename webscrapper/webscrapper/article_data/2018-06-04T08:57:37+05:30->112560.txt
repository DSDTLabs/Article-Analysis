LUDHIANA: As the farmer’s strike entered its third day on Sunday, the shortage of milk has affected some parts of Ludhiana. Some small-scale farmers supplying milk to houses on a daily basis were disrupted and forced to return to their villages. Essentials of a few orders were spilled on the road by protestors. Though there is little change in prices, expectations of availability in the coming days might decrease.

 Reportedly, the strike had little effect on the availability of milk in dairy farms, fearing which people are storing milk in their houses. “Milk supply is regular in our area so far. But the protest might affect rates and availability of milk in the markets, so we have stored a good amount of milk, more than our requirement actually,” said  . “Due to the strike and its major consequences, we have to store milk that leads to some other problems also. Our area’s dairy farm is facing a milk shortage from this morning, which may also lead to a hike in prices in the future,” said   resident  .
 
 “We are facing many problems as   is reducing day by day. We charge nominal prices to customers for milk, but the coming times might affect our sales and availability,” said a dairy owner in  . A dairy farmer on the outskirts of Ludhiana said: “The future of the farmer’s strike might be dreadful for us, as they forcefully disrupt us from supplying milk to city farms.” The whole scenario spells problems for milk suppliers as well as consumers.
