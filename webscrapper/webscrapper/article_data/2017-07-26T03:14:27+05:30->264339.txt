NEW DELHI:   CM  , one of the prime movers of opposition unity during selection of candidates for presidential and vice-presidential polls, said on Tuesday that she is ready to support   Kumar’s candidature for a Rajya Sabha seat from the state if Congress puts up the former Lok Sabha Speaker as its nominee.

 In a new twist to the tale, Banerjee said, “It will be good if Congress, TMC and the Left together support   for the Rajya Sabha seat.” According to the Trinamool chief, this could be the new point of convergence for the opposition parties. Mamata, who was in the capital to attend the swearing-in ceremony of President Ram Nath Kovind, responded immediately on getting to know that Congress was considering to field Meira for the Rajya Sabha from West Bengal. She wanted the word to be sent to Congress.
 
 During the ceremony in the Central Hall of Parliament, Banerjee also called Arvind Kejriwal to her side and made him sit next to her when she found that the Delhi CM was looking for a seat. Mamata has been trying to take the AAP leader along in the opposition group, but Congress has scuttled all moves to get the party on board.
