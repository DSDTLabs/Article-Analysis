KOLKATA:   is likely to back  , a three-time   MP, for her fourth consecutive nomination to the Upper House. 

 Jaya’s Rajya Sabha tenure ends in April 3 and her party lacks the numbers to renominate her.  , on the other hand, is likely to send two new members to Rajya Sabha to replace its renegades Kunal Ghosh and Mukul Roy, paving way for the actor-politician to switch party flanks to earn an RS nomination.
 
 Trinamool, officially, refused to speak on the matter. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will decide and declare the candidates later. Till then, everything is speculation. Let the Election Commission announce the poll dates first,” a senior Trinamool leader said, requesting anonymity. 
 
 Though the leader refused to confirm or deny the developments, party sources confirmed that   had sent feelers in this regard to the CM after the March 2017 poll results showed Samajwadi had managed to secure only 47 assembly seats. The reason isn’t hard to fathom. Samajwadi Party has 19 Rajya Sabha MPs; six of them are set to retire in April 2018. Given the party’s strength in the UP legislature, it hopes to elect only one MP to the Rajya Sabha. With senior party leaders like its Rajya Sabha chief whip   in the fray, Bachchan stands little chance to be renominated.
 
 Trinamool on the other hand is likely to elect two new members, one among them possibly a woman. The party has only two women Rajya Sabha members in Shanta Chetri and Dola Sen. Given its numbers in the Upper House, a one-third women’s representation would require it to nominate more women. Over one-third of the party MPs in Lok Sabha are women. With Ghosh and Roy to be replaced and Nadimul Haq and Vivek Gupta likely to get renominated, Jaya could possibly slip into the role of a Trinamool MP. The other remaining slot, according to sources, could be given to a legal luminary.
