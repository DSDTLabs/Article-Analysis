AHMEDABAD: Reigniting the debate on  , renowned Jain monk   said that he has filed a petition in court seeking a nationwide ban. According to him, pornographic websites are harming the Indian culture.

 “People often tell me that since I am a religious preacher, I should focus on spirituality. However, I feel that I have responsibility towards the society which has accepted me as its own for 40 years. Pornography destroys our culture and offends Indian values. Therefore, it is my responsibility to protect it,” said Acharya, who is coming to Ahmedabad after 17 years.
 
 The local Jain groups are organising a welcome function for him at Vasna on Saturday morning. He will deliver ‘Parivartan Pravachanmala’ from January 8 to 17 near  .
 
 Earlier, Acharya had also filed a petition seeking ban on sex education in schools, and claimed it was an effort to instigate minor children for untimely sex.
 
 Acharya also criticized current education system in India and said that there is no emphasis on value-based education. “Teaching has not remained heart-touching. Schools are only teaching exam oriented topics without focus on value education in the curriculum. Students know how to score marks and pass an exam but don’t know how to tackle the challenges of life,” he said.
 
 “The education system has clearly failed as it only adds to stress among students and drive many to commit suicide. When   was the Union education minister, I had represented this before her. If my guru further permits me, I shall once again bring this to the government’s notice,” he added.
