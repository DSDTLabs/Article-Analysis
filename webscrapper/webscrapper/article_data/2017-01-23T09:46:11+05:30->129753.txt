CHARMINAR: Congress legislator   on Sunday questioned the government's decision to build an   in   even as he said that   and employment are crucial.

 The Telangana government recently announced its intention of setting up an Islamic Cultural Centre at an estimated cost of '40 crore on a six acre waqf land parcel. Congress leader of opposition in the legislative assembly told TOI that as many as 18 of the 40 engi neering colleges had shut down. “Closing colleges translates to a loss of hundreds of seats for Muslim students,“ he said. The legislator conjectured that much like an Islamic centre in the national capital, the one proposed for the city is likely to charge a fee for services provided. “Instead of this, it is better to revive and strengthen   which have been shut due to non-payment of rent, electricity bills, etc,“ he said, while pointing out that the TRS government has a poor record of utilising funds earmarked for the welfare of minorities in the state.
 
 “A survey of Muslims working in companies in the Hitec City should be taken up,“ he said.
 
 Civil society members too questioned the need for constructing an Islamic Centre and said that more meaningful measures must be taken up in the future.
