LUCKNOW: Having worked for the   ( ) for barely a year, a large number of its employees, mostly freshers, have switched to top educational institutions and various government sectors. Within a year, up to 30% of LMRC’s  , supervisors, maintainers, station controllers or managers quit and joined at other places but despite losing them after imparting quality training, the corporation has no regrets. 

 A senior LMRC official said, “The high attrition rate is proof that we had selected best talent from across the state and it is obvious any candidate selected on merit will find many takers. The best example was a freshly recruited junior engineer (JE) from an IIT who secured 99.9 percentile in CAT (Common Admission Test) and is now studying in  .”
 
 Other than the  , there are several engineers who cleared Central services like railways, power corporation, IES (Indian Engineering Services), etc and got lucrative opportunities. “Our exam was highly competitive, so only meritorious students could get through and since they are diligent and talented, companies like NTPC and UPPCL have appointed them after their recruitment in LMRC,” said an official. 
 
 As many as 320 employees were recruited last year as train operator-cum-station controller, operations and maintenance engineers, customer relationship assistants, junior engineers, etc. In the last few months, over 50 persons have left the services. But since LMRC already has a ready list of waiting candidates, it takes no time to fill positions left vacant. Officials said most employees who left LMRC were JEs in the assistant manager category who had joined right after completing their professional courses.
