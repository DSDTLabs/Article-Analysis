CHARMINAR: The recurring unrest at Moin Bagh over the weekly vegetable market has brought to the fore the  's slow progress in issuing ID cards to vendors. 

 The weekly vegetable market in the area has become a bone of contention after vendors, supported by the Majlis Bachao Tahreek, alleged that Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen workers were collecting mamool (protection money) from them. The charge was vehemently denied by the Riysat Nagar corporator   even as he claimed that the presence of vendors was causing a nuisance in the neighbourhood and attracting anti-social elements.
 
 Experts said that if the corporation recognized hawkers across the  , it would put an end to the Moin Bagh controversy and prevent similar situations from coming up in other places.
 
  president Inayat Ali Baqri said GHMC should expedite its survey of hawkers across the city and issue identity cards to them at the earliest. "There are several thousand hawkers in the Old City and it is our belief that cards were issued in a haphazard manner. It is estimated that 2.5% of the city's population comprise hawkers. Completion of the survey, identifying land and designating them as vending zones is the need of the hour," Baqri said. 
 
 The civic body has issued cards to some vendors within its jurisdiction. The town vending committee and GHMC officials have been entrusted with the survey. Urban community development wing additional commissioner   said, "The survey is ongoing and it is true that differences between vendors can be controlled once the cards are issued. Around 5,000 cards have been given, and 9,000 have been uploaded online." He added that a team of GHMC officials would be sent to Moin Bagh to take stock.
