NEW DELHI: When the rage over   Kaur’s   excerpt was storming over social media after the Ramjas college violence in February, the 20-year-old decided to take the higher road. “I thought I must let these people do all the talking. People were putting words in my mouth, and the entire narrative had been twisted. I decided to be quiet and tell my   at my time, at my own pace,” she said.

 This is when the Kaur decided to give her life a voice, shaped by the currents of the present, seen through the eyes of a woman shoved into public scrutiny at a transient time.
 
 Kaur is writing a book, “Moments of Freedom,” which is expected to hit the stores in January 2018. “When I was 12, I read The Notebook (by Nicholas Sparks), and learnt about Alzheimer’s. It scared me to think that I would also lose all memories of my father if I ever had to suffer it. I decided to chronicle them,” said the Lady Sri Ram College student.
 
 “This book is not so much about me as much as the sensibilities that I have inherited from my mother and grandmother. They have both managed to bring up children single-handedly. This book is about three women in a family and their courage,” she told TOI.
 
 Her motivation for the book, however, was not just to chronicle her experiences, but also be heard as the family of a martyr. “This book is also to give the angle of war a more emotional note, because there are not many books to chronicle the war in first hand narratives,” she said.
 
 The book, for Kaur, seemed like a natural progression, especially after the controversy in February. “I felt it is important to tell my story, and keep control of the narrative in my hands,” she said.
 
 The book’s narrative crisscrosses over 70 years from 1947 to 2017 — the time her grandmother came from Lahore to Punjab, through her parent’s whirlwind romance to her days of student activism.
