JAIPUR: Former   and villagers foiled BJP’s attempt to organise a  , at  , the ancestral village of Singh, creating tension in the area. 

 Bharat Singh alleged that BJP local unit wanted to organise a political meet on the pretext of inauguration of a   (CHC) by medical and health minister Kalicharan Saraf on Sunday.
 
 Singh and his supporters staged a sit-in on the spot and the party had to shift the programme to another venue. The stand-off triggered tension with huge police force being deployed in the area. 
 
 Bharat Singh said the CHC has been functional for last one-and-a-half years and the villagers are proud of it.
 
 “We have no objection to BJP organizing a political programme as we are a democracy. But politicization of a government function is unacceptable,” said Singh.
 
 The person who donated the land for the CHC was neither informed nor invited for the event, he said.
 
 Earlier,   had consented to inaugurate the CHC but local BJP leaders seem to have deliberately scuttled it.
 
 Singh, a senior Congress leader, was minister of panchayati raj and public works in the previous Ashok Gehlot government. He lost the last state assembly elections under the ‘Modi-wave’ that decimated the state Congress in December 2013. 
 
 After his defeat, in a rare gesture, he had accepted the post of a ward member (panch) of the gram panchayat while his wife is the sarpanch (head) of the village. The couple, along with the remaining nine panchs in the gram panchayat, were elected unopposed.
