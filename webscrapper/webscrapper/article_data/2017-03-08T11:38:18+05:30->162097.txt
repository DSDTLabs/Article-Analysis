HYDERABAD: At a time when the entire   is cracking down on   of explosives as they are being used by terrorists, a   in   reportedly let off the vehicle that was seized carrying explosives without any licence. 

 Some leaders and a senior police officer of Parigi sub-division are reported to have been involved in the episode. Now the senior police officers of the district and Hyderabad range started probing into the issue. Official sources said the Parigi SI seized a tractor at Mittakodur carrying gelatin sticks on March 5. After seizing the vehicle, the tractor was impounded in the police station. But the sub-inspector neither registered any case against the tractor driver nor did he bother to inquire into the origin or destination of the explosive material. 
 
 Some local politicians held discussions with some senior police officers and released the vehicle without any case on Tuesday. Upon coming to know about the issue, Parigi circle inspector P Prasad on Tuesday evening issued a memo (No CI--I/VKB/2017) to   seeking an explanation. 
 
 "I have instructed you to register a case under Explosives Act and finalize the case. But you have not registered a case against the tractor driver and the owner. The vehicle was released without the knowledge of the immediate officer for the best reasons known to you," Parigi circle inspector P Prasad said in the memo.
 
 When contacted, Vikarabad superintendent of police S Chandrasekhar Reddy said he was not aware of the issue.
