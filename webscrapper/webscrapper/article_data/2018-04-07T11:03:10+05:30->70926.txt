There has always been a struggle for   actors in the industry and many a time they have been body shamed. To change the perception of the people, five plus sized   are emerging out today with their first public production. They use the famous play   by   as a catalyst to bring up questions about artistic choice, the national tale around actors and their body. 

  The play deals with central issues of mind/body/identity that every one of us is very much engaged with. Staged today at Ranga Shankara, J P Nagar, 7.30pm, the play Head 2 Head raises social, cultural and   questions.
