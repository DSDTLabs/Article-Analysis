Vadodara: If you are looking to board an auto-rickshaw, you will be able to identify the auto drivers who are courteous and honest. The city police have planned to initiate a project to identify well-behaved auto drivers and present them a blue-coloured apron. 

 The rickshaw drivers will have to wear the apron and drive the auto whenever they are on duty. 
 
 Police said that it will help them in instilling a sense of discipline among auto drivers. “We will observe the auto drivers who are well-behaved with the passengers, follow traffic rules and maintain their vehicles. The police department will then choose 1,000 good auto drivers and give them the blue apron,” said Amita Vanani, assistant commissioner of police (traffic). 
 
 “The apron will have a logo of Nirbhay Savari and Vadodara city police. This will motivate other auto drivers to drive safe on the city roads. Also, the passengers will know which auto drivers are well behaved,” Vanani told TOI. The police have been focusing on managing rickshaw traffic as the number of autos have gone up considerably in the city over last few years. 
 
 “The police department had issued a number of notifications related to auto rickshaws. Now, all those notifications issued from 1984 to 2017 have been cancelled and a new notification has been made. We have sanctioned many auto stands in the new areas that now see passenger rush,” Vanani added. The cops have regularized 193 auto stands where 902 autos can wait for passengers. 
 
 Also, the traffic department is working with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to install proper signboards including that of no-parking in several areas of the city. The police have already begun cracking down on auto rickshaws carrying more passengers than permitted and those not following the traffic rules. A project to give special numbers to the autos with area code is also underway to help passengers remember the auto number.
