THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and chief minister Pinarayi   on Saturday downplayed the tactical alliance of the party with KC(M) in Kottayam district panchayat. Both leaders made it clear that there was no plan to expand the tie-up to state level. 

 The support of CPM to the KC(M) nominee during the election of Kottayam district panchayat president the other day had upset both Congress and the CPI, whose leaders criticized the act. Veteran CPM leader   was also upset over the decision.
 
 Though CPM leadership had kept mum on the issue for three days, leaders chose to react in public as there was strong resentment among party cadres over the move to align with   whom the CPM had dubbed as notoriously corrupt during the tenure of the previous government. The party also had to face criticism that Mani's affinity to CPM was to settle the bar bribery case, in which he is the prime accused.
 
 Balakrishnan told reporters here that there was no move to induct new parties into the LDF. He dubbed the understanding between CPM and KC(M) as a tactical move to keep UDF out of power. Vijayan, while speaking to reporters in  , said KC(M) had staged a walkout along with UDF in the assembly last week. He said the decision was taken at the local level.
 
 It is learnt that the tactical alliance in Kottayam came up for debate in the CPM state secretariat meeting on Friday. At the meeting, the tactical alliance in Kottayam was approved, it didn't endorse the plan to extend the tie-up to other regions. Apprehensions over aligning with a 'corrupt leader' were raised by a few leaders. A section of the CPM leadership, which wants to align with Mani, will at least have to wait till the vigilance court exonerates him in the bar bribery case.
