PATNA: The   School Examination Board’s decision to bar the entry of Class X examinees with shoes and socks on in the examination hall, has triggered a controversy.

  chairman Anand Kishor on Sunday issued a letter to the education officials, asking them not to allow examinees wearing socks and shoes to write the Matric exams scheduled to begin from February 21.
 
 Assailing the board’s decision, former education minister   said it amounted to harassment of the examinees. “When I was the education minister, the board exams were conducted peacefully without use of unfair means,” he said and added the BSEB should not burden the students with such advisories. 
 
 However, state education minister   defended the board’s decision and said use of unfair means by examinees had brought a bad name to Bihar in the past.
 
 “This initiative will help prevent unfair practices. It’s a time-taking exercise to check whether 17.7 lakh examinees have hidden anything in their shoes,” Verma said and added people should not politicise the move.
 
 According to BSEB chairman Kishor, candidates of many competitive examinations are asked to come in slippers and simple dress. “It is not something new,” he said.
 
 Altogether 17.7 lakh students will be appearing for the BSEB’s Class X examinations at 1,426 centres across the state from February 21 to 28.
