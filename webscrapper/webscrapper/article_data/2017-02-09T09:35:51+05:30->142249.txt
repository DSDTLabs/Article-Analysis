PUNE: The Pune regional unit of   (DGCEI) on Tuesday raided a gutka manufacturing facility at Miraj in Sangli and arrested two persons for allegedly evading taxes. 

 The agency found the unit was making gutka under the 'trade names' of Raj Kolhapuri and Yatri. DGCEI suspects the unit's owners evaded around Rs67.1 crore duty till date.
 
 Gutka is banned in the state. "The masterminds had installed five machines and a generator for power supply. Over eight lakh pouches of gutka were seized, along with 382kg of packing material and 29kg gutka premix raw material," the DGCEI said in a statement.
 
 The unit manufactured gutka at night and removed the finished products next morning.
 
 DGCEI deputy director   told TOI, "Two brothers, Firoz Jamadar and  , and their father, Musa Jamadar, had active involvement in making gutka at the unit. But the mastermind could be a 'big fish'. Miraj has become a hub of illegal gutka manufacturing due to it's proximity to the Karnataka border." 
 
 Firoz and the unit's supervisor,  , were arrested during the raid. The duo have been remanded in police custody till February 13.
