After their divorce in 2014 through which they had maintained a stoic silence,   and  's relationship appears to be on the mend. The former childhood sweethearts took their kids, Hrehaan and Hridhaan, to Dubai to ring in the New Year. Sussanne's presence during the release of Hrithik's last screen outing, ' ', in January was also noted. Besides tweeting in support of the actor, she played gracious host at the film's special screening ahead of its theatrical release and also showed up at the after-party.

  
  
 January saw several other reunions, including movie outings with kids, Hrithik's 43rd birthday bash and his sister Sunaina's a few days later. Soon after, Hrithik went on record to say, "I don't think I can have any relationship in my life which is not peaceful. I need all my equations to be harmonious. If I feel that I am not adding growth to a person or that person is not adding growth to me, the whole exercise is pointless." Now, Mirror has learnt that Hrithik recently bought Sussanne a sprawling apartment in an upscale suburban high-rise. An insider says, "Even after they went their separate ways, Hrithik's prime concern has been the welfare of his ex-wife and their two sons. The apartment he has bought for her is located in upper Juhu, about 15 minutes away from his own residence. His parents, Rakesh and  , live close by too, as do Sussanne's parents, Sanjay and  ."
 
 Since their split, Sussanne had been renting an apartment in a posh Andheri building. But now she and her boys will move to their new address. The Khans and the Roshans will be in good company as an Indian cricketer has also bought a house in the same apartment block.
 
 We reached out to  , who was photographed around the area a few days ago with his son and ex-daughter-in law, to check if the purchase had indeed come through. The veteran filmmaker-actor neither confirmed nor denied the news.
