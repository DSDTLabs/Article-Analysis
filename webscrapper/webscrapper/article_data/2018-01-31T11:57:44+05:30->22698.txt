KANYAKUMARI: Even as protests have been mounting against the proposed international container transhipment terminal (ICTT) in Kanyakumari, a section of people from inland areas is voicing support for the project.

 Most opposing the mega project are fishermen from coastal hamlets.
 
 Backed by the  , newly formed   (KTAI, support movement for Kumari Port) organised protests at eight spots in Kanyakumari on Tuesday to highlight the benefits of setting up a port in the district. “We are not trying to show our strength at this stage. We are trying to enlighten people and to wipe out misconceptions spread by a group of people,” KTAI coordinator   said.
 
 Pandian, who is the BJP’s Kanyakumari parliamentary constituency in-charge, said that the leaders who opposed   in nearby Tirunelveli district opposed ICTT which was first proposed to be set up at Enayam. “But again the same persons are instigating people in coastal hamlets here,” he said.
