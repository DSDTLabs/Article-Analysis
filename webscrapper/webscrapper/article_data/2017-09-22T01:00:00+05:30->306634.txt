Few siblings have had the chance to relive their real-life relationship on screen. Shraddha and  , who play   and   in 'Haseena Parkar', co-produced by Sameer Antulay and Babu Tyagi and produced by Nahid Khan, have left no stone unturned to emulate the don bhai-behen to perfection. The actors were so involved with the project, that they started improvising on the dialogues on the spot. They also kept the pace of the scenes going, making them look natural. Director   says, “Siddhanth and Shraddha share an amazing chemistry on screen. It was even better when they tweaked their lines; it made the scene better.”
