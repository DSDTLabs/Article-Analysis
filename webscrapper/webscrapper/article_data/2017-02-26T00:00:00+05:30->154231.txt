There’s a windfall of   memoirs around us. From   to  ,   to  ,   to AR Rahman… no one is shying away from talking about his/her life story. What has changed from the time biographies were rare, even for national icons? 

 Advertising guru Santosh Desai believes the 24x7 onslaught of TV cameras and social media have played a big role in changing perspectives – of audiences about their icons, and icons about their audiences. Desai explains, “We are in a world, where sharing is the norm. We are more public about everything we do, people talk, and then loose talk about you. Celebrities need to talk straight and put records right once and for all. They have realised that in a digital age one needs to declare, ‘this is my reality’.” 
 
 Says Nasreen Munni Kabir, author of Yours Guru Dutt: Intimate Letters of a Great Indian Filmmaker and  : The Spirit of Music among others. ''We are witnessing the rise of liberal, open, tell-all, confessions. I feel we will see a lot of younger actors penning their tales that will be more open, and we, as audiences or readers will be less judgmental too.'' 
 
 
 
 There was a time when showbiz memoirs used to be just a bunch of anecdotes strung together which gave away nothing about the human being that these people were. The struggle was documented but never the human frailty or confession about affairs or sexual identity. Not anymore.
 
 After years of being ambiguous about his sexual orientation, director Karan Johar confessed he is gay in his authentic memoir An Unsuitable Boy, without spelling it out. He writes, “Everybody knows what my sexual orientation is. I don’t need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won’t only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I Karan Johar will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me.” (sic)
 
 While that statement led to a controversy, which in a digital world, is more fodder for entertainment and hence, publicity, it did reveal that stars are now open to talking to the world about their private lives, even if it means revealing a fact that could be considered potentially scandalous and fatal to one’s career even a decade ago.
 
 Desai explains why: ''The world isn’t just about being a PR-processed  . The days of the sugar-coated Simi Garewal shows are over. The idea of a star has been redefined in the age of Instagram. There’s an open, honest narrative these days. The older stars are also swept into this new narrative. Even though controlled, these are new open narratives, showing the world they are human and vulnerable.''
 
 
 
 Eighties’ reigning star Shatrughan Sinha whose authentic biography titled Anything But Khamosh took almost seven years to be completed, says, ''Why would you read about something that’s all good? I’ve spoken about some of the most turbulent times of my life in my biography. My narrative is about a man from my background who achieved success in   and politics. It couldn’t have been without ups and downs, could it?'' What comes out in the biography is also his life philosophy: When the going gets tough, get tougher. 
 
 Journalist Khalid Mohamed has recently written 1960s’ reigning queen Asha Parekh’s biography, The Hit Girl while filmmaker Fauzia Arshi is planning to pen down veteran actor Kader Khan’s memoirs. ''There’s great candour in her life story and we have told it the way it was,'' says Mohamed about the personal one-on-one account of Parekh’s life as a hit-maker and the chairman of the Censor Board in the early Noughties. 
  
 In the age of sensationalism, candour can be a double-edged sword. You say too little, you are perceived to be a hypocrite, you say too much, you are branded a publicity monger. Rishi Kapoor whose   Khullam Khulla recently hogged the limelight, says, ''It has never been about putting information for the sake of sensationalising. I have spoken about aspects of my life that I thought were interesting, even if they painted me in a less-than-favourable light. I have lived my life in a certain way and that is what I have tried to be when writing about my life. Yes, readers, the media, might think that I have put out too much personal information, but that’s their prerogative. I was just telling my story the way I have lived it. There’s no other way of writing an autobiography.''

 The time is ripe to tell their stories - given that our world is greatly identity driven. I think that honest biographies also humanise the stars and help us pin hopes on them

 What made me write was that I just felt like re-living my life. I haven’t put everything into the book... I left it to the reader to decide, whether there is a personal information overload
