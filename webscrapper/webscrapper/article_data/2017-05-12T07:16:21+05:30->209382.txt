MUMBAI: The upcoming   is likely see the state implement the   for 100% seats in private colleges and for 85% quota in deemed universities.

  (DMER) is formalizing its policy before the same is cleared by the state in a resolution. The fees for 85% seats in the UG courses too have been declared—from Rs 9.5 lakh in Somaiya Institute of Medical Sciences to Rs 4.5 lakh on the lower side for Annasaheb Chudaman Patil College, Dhule.
 
 The first round of post-graduate medical admission saw the state fill up 2,400 of the 2,800 seats. The lion’s share of 1,400 seats under the government and corporation institutes was snapped up first followed by 800 slots in deemed varsities and 100 other seats in private colleges that were with the government in the first round. The nine colleges that did not participate with the state are likely to submit their details by late Thursday and the pool of seats for the second round would increase by 225 seats. “The fact that we filled so many seats puts pressure on the nine private colleges,” said DMER chairman Pravin Shingare. 
 
 With regards to fees, he said any college charging more than what the   has cleared, would be fined under the   rules and the DMER would recommend cancellation of their affiliation. As per an SC verdict, colleges can charge five times the fee decided under the state quota from NRI students. But Shingare said there was no clarity on what colleges could charge under the management quota and he needed to check with the FRA whether it was empowered to regulate fees under this quota.
