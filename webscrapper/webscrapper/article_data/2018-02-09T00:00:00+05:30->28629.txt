There was a time when   did only one or two films a year, a trend he has been consciously working on changing. Moving from one project to the other has also meant that he is bone tired when we caught him for a quick interaction ahead of the release of his film,  , which hits theatres today. But he lights up as soon as we get chatting, telling us why audiences should catch the film this week.
The thriller, produced by A Venkatesh, Niranjan and R Sundar Kamaraj under Manu Enterprises, which has been directed by  , sees Chiru play a blind man, a first for him, and a chef at that. “Getting my body language right took a while, as I would inadvertently look directly at my co-stars in response to their lines. But it was a good experience getting into this character,” he says.
 In the film, Chiru is paired with   and Hariprriya, with the latter playing a character with negative shades. He says, “The casting for Samhaara has been spot on, especially with   and  , both of whom have done roles that are new to them.”
 “Overall,” says the actor, “Samhaara is a very well-made film that is content driven. Audiences will find it the subject novel and the narrative will have them glued to their seats right from the word go. This is a serious film with a lot of comedy, which is what I liked about it.”
 What elevates the narrative, adds Chiru, is the music by Ravi Basrur. “The music for a thriller has to be just right and Ravi has captured all the emotions perfectly. His compositions and the background score make audiences feel even more involved in the proceedings. In fact, he has said that he is very happy with the music of Samhaara,” Chiru signs off.
