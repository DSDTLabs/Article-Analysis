Amritsar: At a time when just six days are left to the assembly elections in Punjab, the Border Security Force (BSF) has thwarted an attempt by cross-border smugglers to push lethal weapons into the state through the international border.

 BSF deputy inspector general (DIG) Jatinder Singh Oberoi informed TOI on Saturday that they had recovered four pistols, including three Chinese pistols and 30 cartridges, ahead of the border fence near Daoke village ​on Saturday​.
 
 He said a “forward patrolling” party of BSF heard some footsteps and challenged the possible intruders​, but they fled.​
 
 He said due to a thick layer of fog, the search operation was delayed. During a serach carried during the day, BSF recovered three Chinese pistols tied to a loose shirt, another locally made pistol and thirty cartridges from two places near the border fence by afternoon.
 
 DIG Oberoi apprehended that there could be at least two Pakistani smugglers and the ​modus operandi could be to throw the pistols over the fence.
 
 Intelligence sources didn’t rule out the possibility of use of arms for ​disrupting the poll-bound state. “But there is hardly any likelihood of catching the culprits on the Indian side since there is no evidence about the persons who were to retrieve the arms consignment,” said sources.
