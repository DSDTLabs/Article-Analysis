The Yerawada Jail inmates are in for a treat this Friday. As part of the rehabilitation program ‘Preranapath’, legendary   maestro Ustad   will visit the jail and interact with the inmates. Confirming the development, Hussain’s manager Surendra Mohite informed, “He was being approached for the interaction for a while now. But owing to his packed schedule, it kept getting delayed. This time however, he will be a part of the initiative.” When asked if the ustad will perform as well, Mohite replied, “He always has his tabla with him. Though a performance is not part of the schedule, if the inmates insist on it, he might perform too.” Eminent personalities including singer Shankar Mahadevan, actor  , scientists Raghunath Mashelkar and Jayant Naralikar have interacted with inmates under this initiative before.
