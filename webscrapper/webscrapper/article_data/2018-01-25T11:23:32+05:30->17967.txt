 Meghsingh said, “The government tried to cheat us by calling fake Karni Sena members and other Rajput members and then announced that all is well. When home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja called me, I told him we will not tolerate this and the bandh will happen in Gujarat. Later, Raj Shekhawat apologized and assured his Sena’s support.”
 
 Asked about law and order, he said, “We will hold a peaceful bandh and hospitals, milk and grocery shops and medical stores will be allowed to remain open.”
 
 Raj Shekhawat backtracked from his earlier statement and said, “The state government tried its best to stop the release of Padmaavat and we are happy at that. Later I was told that Karni Sena will hold peaceful protest so I will also support the bandh call.”
