In all these years 
  has been known for her histrionics rather than her happy feet. In fact, the last time she grooved, uninhibitedly, on screen on multiple songs was when she went 'Ooh la la' in The 'Dirty Picture' back in 2011. But that is set to change in her upcoming comedy-drama ' ' in which, as Mirror had earlier reported (November 29, 2016) she will be playing a fun, feisty, late night Radio Jockey (RJ) called Sulochana aka Sulu who hosts a semi-adult show. 

 The film marks the directorial debut of adman   who is known for directing the India-Pakistan ' ' commercial that aired during ICC World Cup 2015. Now, Mirror has learnt the   will be dancing on four songs, including a hip hop number and a full-blown Bollywood song with all its latkas and jhatkas.
 
  
  
 Vidya confirmed the new, saying, "I've begun to enjoy dancing, it's fun, and 'Tumhari Sulu' has a great array of songs. I'm looking forward to the rehearsals."
 
 A source close to the film revealed that straight after the release of Srijit Mukherji's period drama, 'Begum Jaan', Vidya will dive into the final round of look tests and script readings. The T-Series and Ellipsis production starts filming towards the end of April.
 
 "There's a hip-hop, street-style track and a full-fledged Bollywood piece, besides a happy romantic number and a dreamy, mood song. Each genre being distinctly different from the other lends itself a unique style of choreography and Vidya will be taking dance lessons for a fortnight or more before she goes on the sets," informs the source.
 
 Suresh adds, "Music and choreography are integral to the film as they take the story forward. We are working hard on devising unique styles of dance for the four tracks. The team is putting together reference video edits for each song and working with the production designer, cinematographer and choreographers on everything from the colour palette to the moves."
