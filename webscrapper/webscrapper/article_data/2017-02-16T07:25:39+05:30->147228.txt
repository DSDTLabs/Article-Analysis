GANDHINAGAR: The   for Women, which is suo moto inquiring into the   sex scandal, which allegedly involves half a dozen BJP leaders from Kutch, is likely to submit its report to CM   on Thursday and propose several measures. 

 Sources close to the development said: "After the Naliya sex scandal was exposed the state commission for women visited Naliya and met the victim, local police and other authorities concerned. The commission is likely to present its report to the CM on Thursday."
 
 "On primary investigation, the commission proposed taking further action on the victim's complaint. The commission may also summon one of the women accused (known as 'Bhabhi') for further investigation. The commission has proposed that security be provided to the victim. However, it is unlikely to consider the victim's demand for investigation of the racket involving more than 40 other victims." The commission is likely to visit the victim next week too.
