If you’re at a city gastropub or your gym and you don’t like the music, chances are that you could change it to your taste. Apps, like   for instance, allow people to choose their music and play what they want, like the old-fashioned jukebox, only over their smartphones this time. Of course, there is a vote for the most popular songs if there are too many people using the apps, bringing in a sense of competition to get your song up on the playlist.
Actress and restaurauteur   thinks that this is a very cool idea for slower nights. “It is great that you can get to choose your kind of music when you’re on your night out. This adds all the more zest to your plans,” she says. Most people choose apps like these as icebreakers to bond with other guests, given that there is that urge to get their song on top of the list with maximum votes for it. Actor-filmmaker   says, “This is a fun   that allows you to chill with your friends over your kind of songs on an easy evening out.” The apps are also popular across gyms, restaurants and cafes. 
 DJs, who often complain that they are reduced to jukeboxes, think such apps are a welcome change. “I think it is great that people get to choose and the crowd can have their way. But, I hope it stays to just a few nights a week and they let us do our jobs the rest of the time,” says  . 
 "Most cafés and hotspots used to play music from a set CD or pen drives. Based on the feedback from guests and other food apps, we’ve tailored this app for all," says   from BC Jukebox
