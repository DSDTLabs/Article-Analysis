The Patna high court dismissed on Monday two different public interest litigations (PIL) challenging the validity of the new JD(U)-BJP government in Bihar.

 The division bench of chief justice   and justice AK Upadhyay, while asking the petitioners not to convert the court into a “political arena”, ruled that the newly-formed government was legit as it had passed the floor test in the state assembly.
 
 Petitioners Saroj Yadav and Chandan Kumar   legislators), and Jitendra Kumar (a former village head from Patna district) had challenged the new government, arguing that governor   should have invited RJD, the single largest party with 80 MLAs, to prove its majority after   resigned as the CM on Wednesday. 
 
 The petitions also argued that the governor had asked RJD leader   to meet him at 11am on Thursday but Nitish was sworn in at 10am. “The oath taking ceremony timing was suddenly preponed to 10am from 5pm, but the governor did not change the time to meet the leader of the largest party,” they said in the petition, while citing the SC ruling in the 1996 SR   case and the 2006 Rameshwar Prasad vs Union of India.
 
 The court, however, clarified that the SC in the Bommai case, had laid down that the main criteria for formation of government was floor test and in the present case, the newly-formed government won the trust vote in the assembly.
