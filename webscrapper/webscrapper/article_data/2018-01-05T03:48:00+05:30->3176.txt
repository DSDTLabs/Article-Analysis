Nagpur: Even as the deadline set by Nagpur University (NU) comes to end today, senior academician Dr Vedprakash Mishra, on Thursday, reiterated that he was yet to receive the show cause notice served to him in an alleged case of plagiarism. Vice-Chancellor SP Kane said the director of board of examinations and evaluation Neeraj Khaty has confirmed to him that the notice has been delivered to Mishra. Mishra also denied that the case pertained to plagiarism in thesis. “The issue is not pertaining to any thesis but a field report, which is a part of internal assessment and is not a separate head of passing and has a weightage of 10% of the total aggregate weightage in terms of the prescribed scheme of examination for postgraduate diploma in Gandhian Thought,” Mishra said. Mishra also said that the civil court never upheld the findings of Ratnaparkhi report, on the basis of which the NU had initiated the action. “The report came to be dismissed for default and not on merit on November 22, 2013,” he said. VC Kane said a field is a thesis and the case is of plagiarism. Asked what action would be taken in the case, Mishra fails to respond. Kane said, “The Board of examinations and evaluation would be meeting on January 24. If he doesn’t reply then another 15 days would be given so that there are no claims that enough opportunity was not given.” The VC’s decision to give another extension again raises question on the NU’s seriousness. NU insiders asked if the VC was indeed willing to take any action or just keep putting of the issue.
