PATNA: The Bihar government has planned to rope in parents to check school dropouts, most of which are reported from   of the society.
 
  Sources said on Monday the state mass   is all set to launch a pilot project, christened ‘Koi Bachcha Peechhe Nahi, Mata-Pita Chhute Nahi’, on February 20. To cover 600 habitats in Nalanda district, the pilot project will be subsequently launched to cover 30,000 habitats all over the state.
  
  The project is part of the CM’s  , which was launched in 2012. Tola sevaks, who have been tasked with implementing the pilot project, will be trained for the purpose from January 26, said the sources.
  
  The mass education department’s new initiative seeks to target mahadalits, dalits, EBCs ( ) and minority children and parents. Besides aiming to retain children in schools, it envisages to impart basic education to parents, especially mothers, so that they could read, write and do basic calculations and prove role models for their children.
  
  “We have inputs to suggest that children belonging to weaker sections get enrolled in schools but do not continue with the dropout rate shooting up to 40%. Retaining them in schools as well as increasing their output is a challenge. It is to meet this challenge that we have chalked out this project,” said Vinodanand Jha, director of the mass education directorate.
  
  Tola sevaks will be assigned the responsibility to ensure that children go to school every day. The tola sevaks will also be tasked with coaching the children after they return from school. “Children will also be given posters which they should use to adorn their home and learn from them,” Jha said, adding one tola sevak will be responsible for 25 students and their parents.
