MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday rebuked the   over the latter’s   policy which has resulted in vehicles being parked anywhere across the city.

 “You have no policy. Anybody can go and park anywhere,” said a bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   while hearing a public interest litigation filed by  , seeking regulation of traffic following increase in vehicles in the city and highlighting the inconvenience being caused to citizens due to haphazard parking of the vehicles.
 
 The judges pointed out that every open space is used for parking. “You don’t have anything in place. Giving tenders and allotting (parking) policy is no policy,” said Justice Kulkarni, giving examples of  , P D’Mello Road and Juhu, where for years, commercial and private vehicles are being indiscriminately parked on both sides of the roads. When Justice Kulkarni pointed out that there is no comprehensive policy for parking in the island city and the suburbs, Justice Chellur said, “They have a policy. They don’t implement it.”
 
 When the Manch’s convenor Bhagwanji Raiyani said that Mumbai has five times the capacity of cars, the bench pointed out that each house has “four to five cars and parking for barely one or two vehicles. The other three cars are parked on the roads”. “In Mumbai, after five years, you’ll not have any place to go. They’ll (people) walk on vehicles. Footpaths are taken over by hawkers,” said Justice Chellur. The Chief Justice pointed out that at Malabar Hill, where she resides, “everywhere, on both sides of the roads, vehicles are parked”. “Its like a big necklace,” she said.
 
 The BMC’s advocate said that the traffic police tow away vehicles that are parked illegally. When Justice Kulkarni said that parking is a serious issue in Mumbai, Justice Chellur said, “The only solace is that Bangalore is worse than Bombay (sic).” The judges will fix a date for final hearing and disposal of the PIL.
