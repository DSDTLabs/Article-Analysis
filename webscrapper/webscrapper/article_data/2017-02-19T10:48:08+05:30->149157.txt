BENGALURU: While all eyes were fixed on the planes in the air, Squadron Leader  , a helicopter pilot was among the senior officials in and out of the base. For Tanya, who has over 1,300 hours in IAF's helicopter fleet, including two major rescue operation in Uttarakhand and Srinagar, flying in hometown Bengaluru is still very special. 

 It was in Bengaluru, more than 10 years ago along with several enthusiastic teenagers at 1 Karnataka Air Squadron, NCC (Flying Arrows), that she flew for the first time. And for many along with her, the love of flying made their career choices an easy one. “During my days in the   itself, I knew I wanted to be a pilot,” she said. 
 
 "When we used to fly in Bengaluru, the only tall structure we could see from the sky was the Utility Building. Now it’s all changed,’’ she added.
 
 It was her love for flying that found her the love of her life as well. Tanya has been married to a chopper pilot for five years. The couple were deployed in the rescue mission during the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. A year later, she was also part of Operation Megh Rahat, rescuing citizens in Srinagar.
 
 Back at the airbase, Tanya was making plans with her buddies from her old squadron. “Many of my seniors, batchmates and juniors from the squadron have joined the forces. Many are in civil aviation and other fields too,” she said.
