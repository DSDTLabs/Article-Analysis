GURUGRAM: The greens have raised a red flag over the spot selected by MCG to start a construction & demolition (C&D) waste management facility in Basai. 

 The spot zeroed in by the authorities is a wetland, which attracts many birds which are found only in this region. Birdwatchers say the habitation will get disturbed if the waste plant comes up at the spot.
 
 On Monday, MCG and IL&FS, which is constructing the first such treatment plant in the state did a ‘bhoomi puja’ for the processing facility, which is expected to process 300 tons of C&D waste per day. The entire area was scattered with plastic bottles after the event got over and the authorities did not bother to clean it up. 
 
 “Basai is one of the most condusive habitat for the birds in Delhi NCR as it comprises of large open water bodies, reeds, scrubs and open fields. Therefore it invites different kinds of birds and some of them are fairly uncommon and have found refuge in these habitats. Some of these birds are Smoky Warbler, Graceful Prinia, Baillon’s Crake which are found in abundance. This habitat will get disturbed if this plant comes up. We will send a petition to the   to review their decision,” said  , a bird watcher.
 
 The environmentalists have also slammed the decision. “It is very unfortunate that whenever the city makes a forward movement about waste management, the authorities always choose the eco-sensitive zones. Solid waste is already getting dumped at  , located at the foothills of   and now we will have the C&D waste plant in the  ,” said an activist requesting anonymity.
 
 However, the MCG authorities said adequate precautions have been taken to address these concerns. “Wet processing technology that will be used in the plant is adapted to suit the C&D waste generated in India. The wet process will also minimise process residues as well as dust and noise pollution,” said a MCG official.
