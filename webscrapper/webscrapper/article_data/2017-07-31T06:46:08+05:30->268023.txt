KOLKATA: Nani Gopal Chatterji (85) and his brother Nepal (81) had pledged to donate their organs a decade ago and now, their family members have turned it into reality.

 While Nani passed away on February 9 after suffering a cerebral stroke, Nepal died on July 20 due to pneumonia. 
 
 Nani’s son Samip said, “My father was bed-ridden for three years after the stroke, during which, he repeatedly insisted that we donate his body. We contacted Disha Eye Hospital as soon as he died. The hospital collected his eyes from our home in Sodepur. Later, we donated the body to   and Hospital. Had we known that the skin could also be used we would have made opted for that as well.”
 
 In case of Nepal, who died at Peerless Hospital, his son Sudip was quick to contact the health officials and was asked to take the body to SSKM Hospital. “My father did not want us to cremate his body. The hospital asked us to get in touch with the additional director of health service,  , who helped us with the donation. I did not have to visit   or the hospital. The health officials mediated with the hospital authorities.”
 
 Sudip said, though his mother Seema was in a state of shock after his father’s demise, she agreed to allow the donation. SSKM Hospital’s plastic surgery unit has preserved Nepal’s skin to perform grafting surgery on burn patients. Nepal’s eyes were also donated that have already been given to two blind patients. 
 
 Asim Chakraborty, director of regional institute of ophthalmology, said, the eyes were in good condition and donated to two blind patients, who had earlier enrolled for receiving an eye. He, however, said that the patients’ identities could not be disclosed. Braja Roy of Ganadarpan, an NGO working with  , said, more people are coming forward for donations defying taboos. “Many people are pledging to donate their body to make their death meaningful.”
