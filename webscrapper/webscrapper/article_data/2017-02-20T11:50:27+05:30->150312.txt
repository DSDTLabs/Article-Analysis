BHUBANESWAR: After Round 4 of panchayat elections on Sunday, the   crossed the half-way mark of 50% seats to form zilla parishads (ZPs) in eight of the 30 districts, sending shivers down the spine of the   government. 

 Apart from Kalahandi, Mayurbhanj, Bargarh and Balangir districts, where the party was already near the half-way mark after third round, it added Deogarh, Malkangiri, Sambalpur and Sonepur to its kitty.
 
 The saffron party swept the Kalahandi district by winning all the 30 ZP seats, which went to polls in the four phases. The district has total 36 seats. Polling for remaining six seats in the district is scheduled for Tuesday.
 
 In Bargarh, the party has won 19 out of 34 seats while it got 10 out of 15 in Malkangiri. It has won 10 out of 18 in Sambalpur, 28 out of 56 in Mayurbhanj, four out of seven in Deogarh and eight out of 13 in Sonepur district. The party own 17 out of 34 seats in Balangir where polling was held in 26 seats by now. 
 
 Of the 161 ZP seats, which went to polls in the fourth phase on Sunday, results of 130 seats were available till filing of this report. While the BJD won in 68, BJP got 58 and Congress four. This takes the BJD tally to 368, the BJP's to 238 and 44 to the Congress from among the 698 seats where election were already held. Polling for the remaining seats will be held on Tuesday. Odisha has total 853 ZP seats. Election is being held in 848.
 
 In the unprecedented lotus bloom, the saffron party's state unit president Basanta Panda has reasons to worry: The BJP could not open account in his home district Nuapada, in sharp contrast to the party's clean sweep in Kalahandi. Nuapada was a part of Kalahandi before being carved out as a separate district in 1993. 
 
 Nuapada is the only district where the BJP is yet to make its presence felt though it won at least some ZP seats in all the rest 29 districts. While polling was already held for 12 ZP zones of the district, the rest two will go to polls on the last phase. "Certainly, Nuapada defeat is a matter of concern. We will review what went wrong but overall the mandate proves people want a change," said BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma.
 
 In 2012, the BJP had failed to open its account in 14 districts. It had own only 36 seats and did not form any ZP. 
 
 The Congress has swept Jharsuguda by bagging eight out of nine seats. The BJD has won in 12 districts.
