Vadodara: The move by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to issue notice to the contractor who had taken up the work for the Sanjaynagar rehabilitation in Sama has led to a war of words. 

 Raopura BJP MLA Yogesh Patel, who had taken up the issue with the chief minister Vijay Rupani, continued levelling allegations against VMC commissioner Vinod Rao on Wednesday.
 
 Patel has dug up a letter written by the state governmentâ€™s revenue department seeking details after a complaint was made against Rao by Congress member Jaha Desai who is now a municipal councillor. The letter dated March 7, 2015, made public by Patel states that details sought by the department were not provided and an official should remain present with the details.
