NEW DELHI: A Karnataka   leader, who was on the run after being accused of assaulting a man in Bengaluru, surrendered this morning, reported ANI.

 
 Mohammed Nalapad Haris - now suspended from the Congress for six years - is accused of allegedly thrashing a 24-year-old man in a pub in Bengaluru and then threatening him while he was in hospital where he was taken for treatment. Nalapad is a son of Congress MLA  . 
 
 Earlier, Cubbon Park police booked Haris and an unspecified number of his associates for assaulting Vidvat L at Farzi Café, a bar in Bengaluru's UB City. Following the assault, the Congress not only suspended Haris for six years from the party, it also removed him from the post of Youth Congress general secretary for Bengaluru city.
 
 Police said Vidvat was not in a position to file a complaint as he was seriously wounded, so his friend Praveen Venkatachalaiah filed a police complaint.
 
  “We registered a case against the group which attacked Vidvat. We have named Mohammed Nalapad Haris as accused No. 1 in the case,” said police.
 
 Praveen’s complaint says he was with Vidvat at Farzi Café when a verbal altercation broke out between Haris and Vidvat around 10pm on Saturday.Soon after, 10-15 supporters of the lawmaker’s son hit Vidvat in the face, stomach and chest. They hit him with glass bottles and rained punches on him. Vidvat was rushed to Mallya Hospital and the gang followed them to hospital, and threatened him.
 
 The incident has threatened to snowball into a major controversy in the run-up to the assembly elections, with the BJP and AAP staging protests against the incident. Using the assault as an “example” of Congress government misrule, the 
  has begun making it an election issue, with Haris being targeted in specific.
 
 The BJP has gone on the offensive in the entire incident, with two of three party aspirants for the Shanthinagar seat taking to the streets in protest against Haris’s “goonda raj” in the constituency.
