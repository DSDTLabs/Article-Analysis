NEW DELHI: After months of hectic campaigning for elections in Punjab and Goa, chief minister   will head to Bengaluru on February 7 to undergo a   for high blood sugar.

 “The CM’s blood sugar level has shot up and he is taking insulin thrice a day to keep it under control. He is also running a slight fever. He will be leaving for Bengaluru on Tuesday and is likely to be there for about two weeks,” said a source.
 
 This means that Kejriwal will not be in Delhi as his party completes two years in power in the city. Since the past two months, he has spent most of his time campaigning in Punjab and Goa and has not been in Delhi for longer than a few days.
 
 In January 2016, Kejriwal had undergone a course of naturopathy treatment for 12 days at the same institute for chronic cough and diabetes.
 
 In a recorded message released on Sunday evening, Kejriwal thanked the people of Punjab and Goa, volunteers, NRI supporters and donors for the campaigning. “I would like to thank the people of Punjab and Goa for fighting such a wonderful election. This election was fought by the people, for the people. I would also like to thank volunteers, NRIs and donors. This election was especially difficult as Modiji was after us,” he said.
