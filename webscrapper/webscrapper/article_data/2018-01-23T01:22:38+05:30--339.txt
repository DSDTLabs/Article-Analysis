KOLKATA: When the earth casts its shadow over the full moon on January 31 and makes it disappear for one and a quarter hours, it will be a once-in-a-blue moon opportunity to watch a rare celestial event. Apart from being a total  , it will be a blue moon, a blood moon and a super moon as well.

 The last time a blue moon, blood moon and super moon could be viewed from India was 35 years ago, on December 30, 1982. 
 
 A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, earth and moon are so aligned that for a period of time, the full moon passes through the shadow of earth (umbra). It will be a blue moon because the eclipse will happen on the second full moon of the month. The first full moon this year was on January 2.
 
 “In addition to the blue moon, it will be a blood moon. The term is derived from the reddish copper hue that the moon’s surface will get. The sunlight, passing through the earth’s atmosphere breaks into its constituent colours and the red part of the sunlight that gets scattered the least will fall on the moon’s surface, giving it the reddish hue. As for the super moon, it will be called so because the moon will appear bigger than usual as the full moon and eclipse will be near its perigee, the closest point to earth in its elliptic orbit,” explained MP   director (research & academic) Debiprosad Duari.
 
 Calculations show that at its closest point to earth, the moon is 3,56,400km away while at apogee, or the farthest point of orbit, it can be at a distance of 4,06,700km. 
 
 In Kolkata, the moon will rise around 5.17pm, just before the start of the partial phase of the eclipse. The total lunar eclipse will be completely visible from 6.21pm to 7.37pm, spanning an hour and 16 minutes.
 
 The next total lunar eclipse visible from India will be on July 27, 2018, but it will not be a blue moon or super moon.
