MAPUSA: The   panchayat has issued notices to the owners of a low-lying paddy   located in the village, which is allegedly being reclaimed and illegally constructed upon. 

 In his complaint to the panchayat, Benedict D’Souza, a villager, stated that the field, bearing survey number 181/13 in  , was being illegally filled. He also stated that an illegal construction was under way there.
 
 D’Souza, in his complaint, pointed out that permission is required to be obtained under Section 66 (1) of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act 1994, before the commencement of any construction work, which the owners concerned had failed to obtain.
 
 “Illegal constructions keep coming up in fields while the authorities turn a blind eye. Such acts must be stopped if we are to preserve our fields,” D’Souza said. He alleged that the decision to include Parra in the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA) was aimed at regularising constructions in fields.
 
 Panch member of Almeida Vaddo, Chandu  , said the village panchayat has issued notices to the owners. He also said illegal filling of and construction in fields is a crime.
 
 “As a ward member, I had raised this issue at the special gram sabha called to discus the outline development plan for the village. When local MLA  , who is also the chairman of the NGPDA, said all structures coming up in fields would be regularised, I had raised my objection,” Harmalkar said.
