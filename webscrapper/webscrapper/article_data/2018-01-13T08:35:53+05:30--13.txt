GANDHINAGAR: The state is in a bit of a mess on the sewage treatment front. Only 5% of the sewage generated by 162 municipalities is treated. The situation is no better in the eight municipal corporations.

 Speaking on Friday at ‘Policies to Action’, a two-day national workshop on coastal zone management organized by   ( ),   (IAS), additional chief secretary, forests and environment, said, “The eight municipal corporations, have facilities to treat 95% of domestic sewage, but the quality of the treated waste does not meet standards.”
 
 Agarwal further said that industrial pollution was more dangerous than the 15 polluted rivers in the state. The two worst rivers were affected by industrial pollution and the six in less bad shape were affected only by sewage waste.
 
 He said that the   coast faces the threat of oil spills but the state is in the process of putting together an Oil Spill Mitigation Action Plan, to better protect coastal zones.
 
 The government of Gujarat has sought an extension to the December 31, 2018, deadline from the Central government, for setting up a proposed oceanarium at Somnath, approved under the   (ICZMP). 
 
 Agarwal said bids were invited under a global tender for the second time from interested parties with technical capability. February 12 is the last date for submitting bids. “We have taken land from the Somnath Trust and the paperwork is complete. The project, when executed, will be a first-of-its-kind in India. When we floated the first global tender, no parties came forward because there are very few oceanariums in the world,” said the additional chief secretary.
