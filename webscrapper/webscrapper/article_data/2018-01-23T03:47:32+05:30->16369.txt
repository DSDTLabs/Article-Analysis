LUCKNOW: Shree   said on Monday it is ready to watch the pre-screening of   only if it is shown the version of the controversial film which will be released on January 25. It added that it shouldn’t be misguided by being showed any other version. 

 Founder of the outfit, Lokendra Singh Kalvi, said the organisation had received a letter of invitation from director   on January 20. “The letter said the screening is meant to remove our ‘misguided grievances’. We are not misguided. The director needs to decide if the film is a historic work or a piece of fiction, because we will not allow any romantic scene to be shown between   and Rani Padmini, even if it is a dream sequence,” said Kalvi. “We wrote back to Bhansali that his letter came too late. We are ready to watch the pre-screening but Bhansali can decide when he wants that, after a year or five years, for it won’t be released on January 25. Still, we will watch it only if it is the version that is to be released.” 
 
 The letter from Bhansali clarified that the said dream sequence that has received major flak from the Rajput community is not part of the film. It also said that the film would make the entire Rajput community proud. For this, the   should come forward, watch the film and extend its support for its peaceful release. 
 
 But Karni Sena said this was only an “eyewash” and Bhansali didn’t appear serious in his intentions.
