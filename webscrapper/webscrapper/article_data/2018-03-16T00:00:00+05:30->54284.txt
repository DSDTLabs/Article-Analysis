Manoj began his Sandalwood journey in 2008 with  , as one of the lead actors. Unhappy with the scripts coming his way, he came up with an original one — a love story based on a true incident.  , produced by MK Films, releases today, and Manoj tells us about his journey of becoming a lead actor and about the film…

 
 
 It was always my dream to become an actor. After Moggina Manasu, I wanted to work with good directors, but wasn’t getting the right script. I then went to the   to learn direction. When I planned to direct #O Premave, my team told me that the lead character suited me well and suggested that I act as well.
 
 
 
 #O Premave is a commercial love triangle, but with a difference. It is packed with comedy, action and emotions. I am a big   fan and his love stories, which Kannada audiences enjoy watching. Why I say #O Premave is not a regular love story is because the screenplay is very different and audiences will enjoy every minute of it.
 
 
 
 The film has five songs that are doing well online. There is also an interesting special appearance by Huccha Venkat. He will be seen in a completely new avatar and audiences will be shocked to see him that way. The others to look out for are  ,  ,   and Sadhu Kokila.
 
 
  
 
 
 Taking on the dual role of actor and director was quite challenging. But my associates really helped me with it. To make things easier, we did a lot of rehearsals and planning before the shoot. I have learnt a lot through this journey; it has been an enriching experience. 
 
 
 
 Today’s generation takes love lightly. In their chase for success and money, the youth has forgotten the importance of relationships. This youthful film speaks about that. What’s more, it’s based on a true incident of a couple I met around three years ago. Like their story, the movie also has several twists and turns till the climax that will keep people at the edge of their seats.
