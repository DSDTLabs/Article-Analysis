Trichy: With gauge conversion work on the Karaikudi – Pattukottai stretch along the Tiruvarur – Pattukottai – Aranthangi – Karaikudi section having been completed, the commissioner of railway safety (CRS), southern circle, Bengaluru will conduct the mandatory inspection on February 27, 28 and March 1. The 122km Tiruvarur – Karaikudi section and the 37km Thiruthuraipoondi – Agasthiampalli gauge conversion work was taken up during 2012, at Rs 240 crore in a phased manner. The first phase of 72.23km between Pattukottai and Karaikudi was completed recently. Along with the conversion work, 14 bridges, 262 small bridges, 36 manned level crossings, five crossing stations and three halt stations were constructed. Work on the new buildings for Kandanur Puthuvayal, Aranthangi, Ayankudi, Peravurani and Pattukottai stations have also been completed, sources said. Following this, the CRS has decided to conduct an inspection as well as a speed trial run, railway sources said. During the speed trial that will be undertaken on March 1, all users of railway lines between these stretches have been cautioned not to approach or trespass into the tracks. Meanwhile, commuters and functionaries of unions have appealed to the railway board to resume the remaining work, which has been stalled for more than five years.  The required fund for executing the work for the entire section has been allocated during 2017-18. Even then work on the other two phases has been stalled without any reason, deputy general secretary of DREU, D Manoharan said.
