Villupuram: Scores of   are thronging the district as part of the   18-day Chithirai   festival – regarded as the biggest festival for the  .

 The district administration and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department officials have made adequate arrangements, including police protection for transsexuals, for the festival, urging the public to cooperate in maintaining law and order. 
 
 As part of the festival, many transsexuals from across the country come to Koovagam village here for the various cultural programmes, including   pageants, music and dance events. 
 
 The festival has its roots in the epic Mahabharata. According to a myth, the Pandavas were advised to sacrifice a young, handsome man with courage and skills to Goddess Kali in order to win the war against the Kauravas. 
 
 Arjuna had a son (Aravan) with Naga princess Ulupi. Aravan agrees to sacrifice his life for Pandavas’ victory in the Kurukshetra battle. However, he wanted to marry before dying. But no-one was willing to get married to him as he would be sacrificed the next morning. So Krishna takes on a female form and weds Aravan. Aravani is the name for a transsexual woman in TN. 
 
 These transsexuals, who presume that they are incarnations of Lord Krishna, camp at the Koovagam Koothandavar Temple and participate in all the rituals of the age-old shrine here. 
 
 The 18-day festival that kick-started with flag hoisting and distributing porridge (sagai vaarthal) to the devotees on April 17 will witness the transsexuals’ beauty   contest, as part of the celebrations, on Monday evening. 
 
 The most-anticipated thaali tying and thaali cutting rituals will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday.
