Filmmaker Pratim D Gupta has pulled a casting coup of sorts by roping in Anjan Dutt, Mamata Shankar and   for his new film, Ahare Mon, which is a montage of offbeat love stories. Also part of the cast are  ,   and Paoli. While Anjan Dutt and Mamata Shankar are paired with each other, Adil will be seen opposite Paoli. “It’s quite a dream lineup. And to be honest, the full cast was finalised only a few days back. I’ve worked with Anjanda and Mamo mashi separately in   and Maacher Jhol. Now, I’m really excited to see them together in my film,” said Pratim, adding, “This is for the first time that I will be working with Adil — an actor I admire a lot. He agreed to do the film just after reading a couple of scenes. I’m grateful to him.”

 Adil, on his part, is looking forward to the film as he found his character different and intriguing. “I am a bit worried now. Pratim thinks I am brilliant. But I told him he overrates me as an actor. I hope I can live up to his expectations,” said Adil with a laughter. Talking about his character, he said, “I play someone who dreams of expanding his horizon by travelling across the globe, but somehow he can’t.”
 
  too is also set to make her Tolly debut with this film. She was selected after a series of auditions. “I had seen her performing on stage in Mumbai and always wanted to work with her. Also, her terrific audition helped me make the right choice. I love working with fresh faces and Chitra is just waiting to explode on screen,” said Pratim.
 
 Shooting of the film is already underway. While   is the DoP of Ahare Mon, the songs are being composed by Neel Dutt.
