KOLKATA: Police arrested   Mistry, the wife of app cab driver   who was shot dead at home on April 10, and her paramour from Sonarpur early on Thursday. 

 Samir, an INTTUC taxi union leader, returned home at Sonarpur's Noapara around 11pm on April 10 and sat for dinner. Police said Madhumita (33) served him dinner at the end of the dining table ensuring his back faced the house's main door, which she left ajar. Soon, her paramour Chandan Mondal (33) appeared and shot at Samir from behind.
 
 Cops suspected Madumita's statements were unconvincing. She told the sleuths she kept the door open as it was hot but there was a squall that night. After scanning her phone, cops found several calls made to Chandan, a newspaper hawker at Sonarpur station. Cops said the affair began one-and-half-years ago. They had consulted a lawyer to get Madhumita divorced from Samir. 
 
 The duo confessed to the crime and have been charged with murder under IPC section 302. Baruipur SP Arijit Sinha said, "We want the duo in cop custody for further interrogation."
