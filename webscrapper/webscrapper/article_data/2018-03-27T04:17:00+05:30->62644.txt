Vadodara: M S University Students Union (MSUSU) general secretary (GS) Priyanka Patel on Monday said that girl students of the university are facing harassment almost on daily basis. 

 “Call girls have almost encroached upon the entire stretch surrounding the university campus, especially the lanes surrounding the girls hostel campus. This has resulted in pathetic condition of girl students, who reside in the hostels, as they too are being seen as call girls by outsiders,” she said. 
 
 Patel demanded that the university should take help of the police department and resolve the menace. “I have made several representations both to MSU and the police department but no action has been taken so far.” 
 
 While the union GS highlighted the plight of girl students at the hostel campus, MSUSU vice-president Rati Mehta, too, highlighted the issue of lack of safety and security of girls at the campus. 
 
 A couple of other senators demanded better amenities including more washrooms for female staffers and students at the campus. tnn
