Surat: There was a major rupture in the water supply pipeline at L&T circle under the bridge at   but officials of different departments of   (SMC) in a cohesive effort got it repaired and averted a water crisis in that part of the city on Friday. The   employees worked overnight from 9 pm on Thursday to 6.30 pm on Friday and repaired the 1100mm pipeline. Normally, the SMC staffers take at least 30 hours to repair a damaged pipeline. However, this time they could not have a lackadaisical attitude because of the Prime Minister’s two-day visit to the city is next week. 

 SMC officials from hydraulic department, drainage department, fire department and central zone worked in an integrated manner to restore the water supply. Only   area that receives water from 8am to 12 noon didn’t get water on time. 
 
 A SMC officer from hydraulic department said, “A major crisis could be averted in the city because of an excellent team work between us.”
