INDORE: Processions were taken out and prayers were held at almost all the churches in the city to usher in the Holy Week of the Lenten season on Sunday. The day, which is known as   or Passion Sunday, marks Jesus Christ’s triumphal entry in Jerusalem over 2,000 years ago.

 Singing hymns praising Christ, devout were seen entering the church to attend eucharistic ceremony. St Francis Assisi Cathedral, which is the one of the oldest churches of the city also took out a procession at 8.30am, while the holy mass was held at 6.30am.
 
 “It is believed when Christ came to Jerusalem before his death and resurrection, he was sitting on a colt of a donkey and palm branches were placed on his path by the followers,” said BA Alvares from Red Church. 
 
 “It is observed on the Sunday prior to   and blessed palm leaves are distributed among the believers. The event is also mentioned in all four canonical gospels of the New Testament,” he added.
 
 Early morning mass vigils were held at almost all churches in the city, including St Joseph, St Arnold’s, Holy Cross, St Teresa, St Norbert, St Vincent Palloti and others. 
 
 However, the readings from holy Bible were about preparations to enter into the ‘holy week,’ the final week of the Lent season. Parish Priests highlighted the role of women believers and asked parishioners to keep faith in prayers.
 
 Bishop Chacko T led the procession at Red Church as the parishioners waved palm leaves and sang songs to mark the day. “Palm Sunday summons us to behold our king – the suffering servant who died for the good of the world,” said Bishop Chacko.
 
 Christians will now observe Maundy Thursday on April 13 and   on April 14 with special prayers and penance in the run-up to the Easter Sunday on April 15 midnight.
