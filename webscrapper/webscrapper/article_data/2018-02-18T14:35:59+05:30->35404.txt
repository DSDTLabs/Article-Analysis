VADODARA: The state may have provided national deaf cricketers and even the skipper of the team, but there seems to be little financial support for the deaf-mute cricketers in the state. The team is training in Vadodara for the Eighth National Cricket Tournament thanks to good Samaritans and not formal support.

 The team was to participate in a three-day camp at Vadodara from Saturday, but the Deaf Cricket Association Vadodara (DCAV) that is cash strapped had to ask the skipper of the Indian deaf cricket team Imran   to arrange for their stay and food. The association’s letter to   states, “We at DCAV wish we would help the players, but unfortunately we also have a major problem of funds.”
 
 Sheikh who runs the   is himself a person of humble means and started looking for help for the camp. And the city did not disappoint him with help trickling in for the cricketers. Scion of the royal Gaekwad family   allowed the cricketers to practice at the Motibaug cricket ground. The players will also be provided meals there.
 
 Sheikh said that he approached realtor Bharatsinh Sutreja for the stay of the cricketers. The realtor has a site on the   and prepared one of his larger flats for the stay of the cricketers. “He even arranged for lights and fans in the apartment,” said Sheikh. The cricketers will also be wearing kits provided by Barodians. These include one provided by Gaekwad and another arranged by animal welfare activist Neha Patel.
 
 The cricketers have had to arrange for their fare to travel to Ranchi on their own. The organisers at Ranchi have arranged for their stay and meals during the tournament. Sheikh himself will not be available for the tournament as he has suffered a shoulder injury.
