BENGALURU: The city, which is still recovering from the shock of the   fire incident earlier last month, has only 20 fire stations as against the required 72.

 This issue came to the fore on Wednesday during the release of a five-year fire safety blueprint for Bengaluru released by Beyond Carlton, a city-based fire safety community. The blueprint, which seeks to reduce the number of fire accidents and fatalities, mooted several steps including risk-profiling of buildings, retrofitting fire-safety policies for old buildings and enhancing the inspection programmes.
 
 “With the recent tragedies in Mumbai’s   and Bengaluru’s Kailash Bar, fire management shouldbe at the forefront of any city’s safety efforts. According to the   data, 1,244 people died in fire incidents in Karnataka in 2015, with the all-India number being 17,500. Further, 50% of alldeathsduetofires in commercial establishments were reported in Karnataka,” saidUdayVijayan of Beyond Carlton, which was founded by him a month after the   fire on February 10, 2013, which left nine, including his son, dead and 70 injured. According to   and Emergency Servicesdata, during 2011-16, 29 peoplewere killed, 251 injured and property worth Rs 269 crore destroyed due to fire incidents.
 
 Stating the coordination between all civic agencies was a mustfor theimplementation of the roadmap, R A Venkitachalam of Beyond Carlton said, “This is a collaborative effort, and also needsinputsfrom other departments such as health and transport. One such example would be linking the property tax to the NOC. That way, the owner can only pay the property tax if they possess the NOC.” M N Reddi, DGP (fire and emergency services), said the measures would be integrated into all their ongoing projects.
