When you think of the names   and  , you instantly picture two feminine girls. Well,   and   are all set to change that with their bad boy characters in  . Let’s learn more about these characters from the actors themselves… 

 
 
 Dolly is a very bad guy by nature and although I can’t be anything like him in real life, I enjoyed essaying this character the most. I was in a trance while playing Dolly, since I was completely immersed in it; I actually had a Dolly hangover.   (director) wanted people to see me as a villain, for which he wanted me to get a new look, so that was the first change. But the mental preparation was more; I had to get into the mind space of a rowdy, and with inputs from Suri and my own interpretation of the role, the character began to take shape. This is a very different character. I always wanted to take on an intense role, which is why this excited me. The fun of acting lies in essaying such characters. And I think I have pulled off playing a negative character, since wherever I go now, people call me Dolly.
 
 
 
 Dhananjaya and I are good friends in the movie, but we are polar opposites as far as our characteristics are concerned. While Dolly is loud and aggressive, Chitte is a sober, soft spoken, well-behaved guy, who has quite an intellectual side. He is a man of few words, is confident and doesn’t really care about what others say. He is focused on his goals and guides people around him. He has an emotional side as well; there is a love story with him and he has a family connect. It’s a very different portrayal of a rowdy. Dhananjaya and I are friends in real life as well, and he is the more talkative one among us, so our characters in the film are along similar lines of how we are in real life (minus the violence, of course). But when it comes to how we have been portrayed in films, I have taken his part, and he mine.
