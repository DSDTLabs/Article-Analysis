HYDERABAD:   conducted a brainstorming session on Thursday in the backdrop of shocking police revelations about rampant drug abuse by students, particularly from elite schools. After a key meeting with district education officers and senior officials of the department,   announced no school student will be allowed to carry a mobile phone into classrooms. He also cautioned parents, requesting them to rethink what they equip their children while sending them to school or college.

 Srihari, also deputy chief minister, said it was time for parents to spare a thought before gifting children  , credit cards and even bikes. Parents must watch out for   in their children, like skipping homework or failing to keep pace with academics, said Srihari.
 
 Srihari made it clear that no school student will be allowed to carry a cell phone into the classroom. The minister, however, said they can use their mobile either in principal's room or outside the classroom. He directed district education officers to strictly implement these orders on the ground.
 
 Srihari said while responsibility for well-being of children rests with parents and educational institutions, the government on its part, will punish those involved in drug rackets. “The government is issuing specific directions to managements of schools and colleges. We also have the responsibility of not triggering panic among parents. Investigating agencies and media must exhibit restraint on this issue,“ the education minister said. Any   near schools of colleges must be immediately informed to the police, he said.
