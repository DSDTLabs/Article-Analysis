NEW DELHI: The twins from Odisha,   and  , who were joined at the head and separated after a surgery, are “clinically” well and do not need   or  ,   has told the   (NHRC). The institute has said that the twins’ medical requirements can be managed at any state-level hospital in Odisha with good nursing and paediatric support.

 Jaga and Balia were craniopagus conjoined twins — joined at the head — which doctors had said was a very rare occurrence. They were successfully separated after a 21-hour surgery in October last year.
 
 The NHRC had in March asked for an action-taken report from AIIMS over a petition that sought to prevent the shifting of the twins to a hospital in Odisha.
 
 The petition was filed by Supreme Court advocate and human rights activist Radhakanta Tripathy, who claimed that the AIIMS’ branch in Bhubaneswar did not have the essential infrastructure for the treatment and care of the twins. The boys from Milipada Village in Odisha’s Kandhamal region were likely to be sent back to the state in the second week of March, the petition stated.
 
 In its reply to the NHRC, AIIMS authorities said the children were thoroughly evaluated by a team of doctors, who concluded that risk to life was “very low” and they could be discharged and shifted back to Odisha for supportive and continued care.
 
 The team included pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, plastic surgeons, ENT surgeons, neuropsychologists and neurosurgeons, they said.
 
 “A team of senior doctors dealing with these children have met several times and feel that they can be managed at any state-level medical college or district hospital with good nursing and pediatric support,” AIIMS said in its reply.
