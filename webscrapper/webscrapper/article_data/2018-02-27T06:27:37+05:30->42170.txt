KALYAN: Two little girls were found abandoned at   early on Monday. The railway police are on the lookout for their “father” who left them there in the dead of night. The girls about 1 and 3 years of age were found sleeping on platforms 4-5.

 Railway police who spotted the   alerted their seniors. The kids have been sent to to a  .
 
 Officials said that they tried to get basic information from the 3-year-old, but could not elicit much. “Even the elder child is too small to reveal anything,” said an official. That’s when they turned to footage from cameras at the station. It showed a man leaving the girls there around 8.30 pm. Eventually, the two dozed off at the spot. “When we showed his photo to the older child, all she muttered was ‘Papa’,” said the official, leading them to presume that it is her father.
 
 “On the basis of the footage we are looking for the man,” said police inspector Manik Sathe.
