GURUGRAM: Parents of students enrolled in Blue Bells School gathered outside the school’s Sector 4 branch to protest the annual development charges being forced on them. Around 60 parents of students from both Sector 4 and Sector 10 branches of the school participated in the protest and claimed that sub-standard facilities were being provided by the school. They also asked why the school does not have a parent-teachers’ association yet.

 Mahesh Yadav, whose daughter studies in Class 4, said, “There has been no ‘development’ in these schools. Why should we pay development fee? Other schools also demand development fee, but only once. Here, it’s taken yearly.”
 
 Ankita Sharma, whose daughter studies in Class 5, said, “This school takes money from students for every sanitary napkin the students take from them. This is unethical.” 
 
 The school refuted all claims. The management raised eyebrows on why the protest was held on  , a national holiday.  , director,   group of schools, said, “It was a holiday when no one was present. Some of the protesters could be outsiders. Anyway, parents are free to withdraw their wards from the school.”
