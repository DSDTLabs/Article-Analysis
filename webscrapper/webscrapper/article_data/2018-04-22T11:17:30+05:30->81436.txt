MADURAI: The three factions of the   should reunite and support the National Democratic Alliance ( ), which is going to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to enable Tamil Nadu to continue to benefit from the central government’s welfare schemes, said Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale.

 “Narendra Modi is a strong PM and he should continue as the prime minister in 2019 also. I appeal to the AIADMK to support the NDA at least after the elections, even if it does not form an alliance with the NDA before that, he said.
 
 He was speaking to reporters in Madurai on Saturday after a review meeting with the officers of the social justice department. The department is implementing scholarship schemes for school and college students. “The welfare fund for schedule castes was increased from last year’s allocation, he said. The reservation in education for persons with disabilities was also increased from 4% to 5%.
 
 Athawale said that Modi was not a ‘dalit virodhi’ and that he was a person who is much concerned about the welfare of the dalits in the country. He said that the Centre was firm that the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act should not be disturbed and there is no need to fear that the Act will be diluted, he said.
 
 Caste was the reason for many of the problems and it should be resolved. Reservation is one reason for discrimination, he said. His party supported reservation for all eligible persons in education and services. “I appeal to   leader S Ramdoss that the dalits and Vanniyars should unit and inter-caste marriages should be encouraged,’’ he said adding that it was disheartening that honour killings were taking place in a developed state like Tamil Nadu.
 
 The Minister also commended Madurai collector   for receiving the award for his outstanding service in disability welfare from the President of India.
