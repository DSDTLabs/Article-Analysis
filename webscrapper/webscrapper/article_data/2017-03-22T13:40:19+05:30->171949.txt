NEW DELHI: Three BJP MPs, who have taken up coveted assignments in states, are unlikely to resign from Parliament until the presidential polls slated for July.

 Uttar Pradesh chief minister   and his deputy   are   MPs from Gorakhpur and Phulpur, respectively, whereas  , who took over as Goa CM, is a   MP from UP. Another deputy CM in UP,  , has already resigned as mayor of Lucknow.
 
 The three BJP functionaries will require to be elected within six months of their appointment, which will be due in September this year while the presidential polls are scheduled for July. “They will have to be elected from either House in the state within six months and they will have to resign from LS or RS within 14 days of their election. There is no hurry ... we have more serious issues than going for bypolls at this juncture,” said a senior BJP member.
 
 BJP sources said the party is now focused on the presidential polls as it will have a President of its choice after a thumping win in the recent assembly elections.
 
 Yogi and Maurya have both the option of contesting a bypoll from an assembly constituency as well as for the legislative council as UP has a bicameral House. The two CMs before Yogi -Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati - were members of the council as they didn’t contest the assembly polls.
 
 Even as Yogi is in no hurry to resign from LS and seek election as a state legislator, offers to vacate by party MLAs have been pouring in. Fateh Bahadur Singh, son of former UP CM Veer Bahadur Singh, has offered to vacate his Campierganj seat near Gorakhpur for Yogi.
