 Metro officials said that this park, which has 12 sculptures (created from recycled debris), will also help in educating people about recycling. A Metro official said, "Daily, thousands of people commute by the Metro, and spend time in the Metro premises. At the Shastri Park Metro Station, now they can also visit the park."
 
  Justice Swatanter Kumar, chairperson, National Green Tribunal, who took a tour of the park after inaugurating it, said, "Itâ€™s rightly called Prakriti Park, nothing else would have suited this ambience."
 
  NGT chief had too many questions to ask about the park, and he was quite happy to see the recycled projects. DMRC chief Mangu Singh gave him a detailed description on the contribution of the artists from across the country for this project.
