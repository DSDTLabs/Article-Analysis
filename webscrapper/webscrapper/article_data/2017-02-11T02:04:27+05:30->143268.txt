NEW DELHI: The House of North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday passed a lacklustre   for 2017-18 without any proposals to address the civic body’s financial problems even though there are huge salary arrears.

 The Opposition slammed the budget saying it has been prepared keeping in consideration the upcoming municipal polls. There has been no increase in taxes, nor are there any provisions to improve municipal services. Most of the projects announced have been in the list for the past 4-5 years. 
 
 “The proposed revenue generation plans will take several years to materialise,” said Mukesh Goel, leader of Opposition. Officials said the corporation is banking upon Delhi government to implement the   report for revenue.
 
 The budget was approved by the standing committee in January and the leader of House, VP Pandey, passed it in a special meeting on Friday.
 
 The proposals include developing an old age home in Shalimar Bagh comprising 72 rooms, an eight-storey parking facility at Rajendra Nagar, and doubling of insurance cover to over 3 lakh municipal students. The proposal by standing committee chairman Parvesh Wahi to exempt senior citizens aged above 100 years from property tax has been changed. Now, it will be available to those aged above 85 years. While the civic body has over Rs 500 crore as property tax arrears from private and government bodies, no attempt has been made to recover them.
 
 The corporation has also planned to auction vacant plots to private agencies to develop commercial complexes.
