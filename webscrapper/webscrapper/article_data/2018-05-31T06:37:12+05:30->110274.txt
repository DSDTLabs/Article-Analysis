BENGALURU: A pastor’s estranged wife was hacked 15 times with a machete by his girlfriend’s brother. Luckily, she survived the attack as the assailant fled after her 10-year-old son grappled with him and raised an alarm. 

 Lumina Rani, who is being treated at a private hospital and is said to be out of danger, was walking out of her father’s house in Pai Layout when she was attacked by a bike-borne youth on Tuesday night. He sped away after her son lunged at him. Lumina knew the youth, P Rohit Kumar, 25, a resident of Kittaganahalli, KR Puram, who’s the brother of P Monisha, 23, the girlfriend of her husband A C Prem Kumar. 
 
 Prem is a   at   in TC Palya and his relationship with Monisha had soured his 20-year-old marriage. Lumina has filed a divorce petition against her husband, accusing him of having an illicit relationship with Monisha. The couple has three children.
 
 Acting on Lumina’s statement, Mahadevapura police on Wednesday arrested Prem, Monisha and Rohit. In his statement, Rohit said Prem promised to marry Monisha if he killed Lumina. “With an intention to kill Lumina, I went near the house on the night of May 29 and attacked her with a machete when she came out with her younger son,” police said quoting Rohit.
 
 According to police, Lumina received at least 15 gashes on her body. “The 10-year-old boy is still in shock and has been sent to a relative’s house,” police said.
