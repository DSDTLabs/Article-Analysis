Former Chennai mayor Saidai S Duraisamy on Wednesday appealed to the warring factions in the   to sit and talk out their differences. “As an ordinary member of the party for the past 50 years, I request all 134 MLAs to sit together and discuss the dif ferences and arrive at a solution thereby safeguarding the party and government,“ Duraisamy said in a statement.

 He recalled the initial days of the AIADMK and how its founder M G Ramachandran and later J Jayalalithaa had worked for its growth.
 
 Calling himself an ordinary party cadre, Duraisamy wanted the factions to shun differences and adopt a give-andtake policy.
 
 “I want to recall an incident in 1972 when I went on to a dais where chief minister M Karunanidhi was speaking and gave him a garland made of lemons. I told them that they needed to use lemons to become clean. I was attacked, and MGR took care of me,“ he said. After MGR, the party split. It had to be unified and since then had grown mani fold, he said.
 
 Mylapore MLA R Nata raj said the warring fact i o n s m ay bring down the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu.“People want the status quo to continue. For that there must be consensus between the two groups,“ he said. Nataraj, who did not commit his loyalty to any group in public, said, “I am working towards it (uniting the factions). If they don't, the government will fall. We still have four more years to go. We cannot let Amma's hard work go to the drain. If the government falls, opposition will gain.“
