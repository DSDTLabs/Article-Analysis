SILCHAR: The Separate   Demand Committee, an organization which has been spearheading the agitation in demand for declaring   as a separate Union Territory, has decided to launch an indefinite hunger strike from June 7 seeking early passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. 

 The body's media committee advisor Atin Das said the agitation will be held near the statue of Shahid Khudiram Bose at the Club Road locality of Silchar. Besides members of the organization, people from different walks of life will join the agitation, he added.
 
 Das claimed that Bengali Hindus in Assam, who have been displaced by partition, are the worst sufferers as there is no provision in the Constitution to accord citizenship to them. Adding that many members of this community might be excluded from the updated National Registrar of Citizens (NRC), Das said the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 can help protect the rights of these people.
 
 Meanwhile, the All Cachar Karimganj Hailakandi Students Association (ACKHSA) urged chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to take punitive measures against the members of the All Assam Karmachari Parishad for opposing the bill. ACKHSA chief advisor Rupam Nandi Purkayasthya said the members have violated the section 7 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 which states that no member recruited in service can criticize or speak in the media against policies undertaken by the Central or state government.
 
 ACKHSA added they want an error-free NRC to be published to put an end to the vexed issue of citizenship in the state. No genuine Indian citizen should face any harassment because of the process, the student body maintained. 
 
 ACKHSA advisor Niranjan Dutta also expressed fears that many people from the Barak Valley might be left out of the updated NRC. "We urge the people of the valley to stand united in their demand for considering the electoral rolls for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls for verifying citizenship claims," Dutta said.
