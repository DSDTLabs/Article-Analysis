Coimbatore:  , district collector TN Hariharan launched the sale of bottled Neera,  ,  . 

 The district administration will provide license to three coconut producer companies in Coimbatore to tap ‘Neera’. 
 
 Hariharan told reporters that all the three companies had approached the deputy commissioner (excise) to get license. “The district administration would take steps to set up shops to sell Neera to the public,” Hariharan said.
 
 In Coimbatore district, coconut is being cultivated in about 86,800 hectares. The licensed coconut producer companies plan to produce 1,000 litres of Neera every day. The district administration plans to send 40 farmers to Kasaragod in Kerala to learn techniques on tapping Neera. The training will be given to the farmers from February 19 to 23. 
 
 “Neera would create additional revenue to the farmers and value-added products like Neera sugar, Neera honey and Neera snacks can be produced by the farmers. This would give opportunity to the farmers of the district to sell their value added products in abroad markets also,” said Hariharan.
 
 Director of Anaimalais Coconut Producer Company Limited Dhanapal Muthusamy said that he had set up a unit worth Rs 1.5 crore at Anaimalai to produce Neera. “We will use chiller box to tap Neera from the coconut tree. One or 2kg of ice cubes will be filled in the chiller box and it will be tied in the coconut spadix after slicing a small portion of spadix. We will maintain four degree celsius temperature from taping to selling the drink,” said Dhanapal.
 
 The state government issued a government order (GO –MS no -41) on December 21, 2017 urging the farmers to use anti-fermenting technology. The state government is also planned to invest Rs 50 crore to promote coconut products in Pollachi and Anaimalai.
