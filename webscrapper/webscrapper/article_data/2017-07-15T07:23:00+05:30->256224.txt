NOIDA:   might be a convenient option for a traffic-clogged city like Noida, but so far, only one bike taxi has obtained a full-fledged permit from the transport department. However, over 50 of them are running in Noida-Ghaziabad area on a temporary registration to bikes attached with the UberMOTO and   bike taxi services in the city.

 Both the companies are offering the service near the busy areas of Sector 18 and   stations, which is evident on their apps. The companies are charging Rs 10 to Rs 300 depending on the distance travelled by the vehicle.
 
 Mayank Jyoti, RTO (Ghaziabad) who is the authority to issue permits to thebike taxis in Ghaziabad region (Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshahr) said that none of these vehicles can be allowed to ply in the districts without a permit.“If the bikes are plying on a temporary number, it is illegal,” Jyoti told TOI.
 
 ARTO (enforcement) Gautam Budh Nagar Rajesh Singh said that there will be action against these bikes.
 
 Asked, an   spokesperson said, “In our effort to continuously innovate and develop smart mobility solutions that can help keep our cities moving, we are testing a pilot of bike-sharing services in Noida. We are thankful to the govt stakeholders for enabling entrepreneurship opportunities and a last mile connectivity solution through issuance of requisite permits to the motorbikes.” 
 
  “The UP government is sensitive their citizens’ need for affordable and convenient mobility. To cater to this need, they have issued guidelines for bike taxis in the state. We are supportive of the government's efforts,” an Ola spokesperson said.
