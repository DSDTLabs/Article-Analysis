BENGALURU: The  ' plans to woo religion, caste and community-based vote banks gained further traction ahead of 2018 assembly elections, with a government order on   being issued earlier this week.

 A brainchild of the tourism department, Puneetha Yatra will now provide 21 curated religious tours for various castes and communities. The order was issued on July 11. Each of these routes will be specifically meant for one particular caste, community or religion, although there is no bar on others to take part. With no mention of income limits for people seeking to go on pilgrimage under the scheme, the government has subsidized the cost of each of the 21trips by 25 per cent. According to the order, the average pricing is estimated at Rs 2,844 per person per day, which will be subsidized by the government.
 
 The   state tourism development corporation (KSTDC), which will be organizing the package tour, has said they expect a 60 per cent occupancy rate under the scheme and is likely to cater to 1,38,468 people in the first year itself. The mode of transport for pilgrims will be the KSTDC-owned buses.
 
 Sources said while the 21 routes have been broadly finalized, certain changes in few routes, to include or exclude locations of religious importance, are being incorporated at the ministerial level.
 
 Tourism minister Priyank Kharge said there are still a few loopholes that need to be fixed and that the department will be unveiling the scheme shortly. “The scheme will be for all and not for a select few. The CM will launch it soon,“ he said.
