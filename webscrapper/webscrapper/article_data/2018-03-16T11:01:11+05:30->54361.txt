TRICHY : The alleged irregularity in the appointment of the registrar was among the key issues raised by members of the syndicate of Bharathidasan University on Thursday. At the meeting held on the university premises, it was chancellor-governor Banwarilal Purohit’s nominee to the syndicate, C Murukadas, who raised the matter based on media reports and a petition. 

 After key administrative posts remained vacant for close to a year, appointments of registrar, controller of examination (COE) and director,   were made on December 11. But allegations were raised on the selection panel appointing   to the post of registrar allegedly at the cost of other able candidates. 
 
 Based on reports in the media, PMK leader Ramadoss also asked how Gopinath was given 10 full marks for publishing books and papers when he had kept the column unfilled in his applications. Registrar Gopinath, who was present at the syndicate meeting, was asked to leave the hall before members of the syndicate started discussing the issue. 
 
 As a section of syndicate members were supporting the appointment and ruling out favouritism, the vice-chancellor said he was convinced that it was a clerical error and there wasn’t any grave irregularity. He said that he would give an appropriate reply if asked from the governor’s office on the issue. 
 
 The syndicate also resolved to issue memo to  , head, department of education, against whom a CBI case is pending for committing irregularities. A total of 56 resolutions were adopted at the syndicate meeting.
