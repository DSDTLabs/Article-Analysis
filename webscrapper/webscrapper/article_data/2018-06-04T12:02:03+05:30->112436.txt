AHMEDABAD: The IUCN, in its recently published   has suggested that governments should formulate a landscape conservation strategy in priority areas and should plan and implement habitat management interventions. The   has recommended that the management plan should exclude any road construction activities and tall tree plantations.

 
 The IUCN report suggested that infrastructure developments including roads, electricity network and wind turbines, which have a negative effect on threatened species, should be curtailed or minimized near core breeding areas.
 
 The report stated that to assess the efficacy of these conservation actions, systematic and country-wide population monitoring of the animals on alternate years should be taken up for the next 10 years. Moreover, the IUCN said, core breeding areas should be identified and strict refuges should be created during March and September. This will require acquiring government lands that are not owned by forest departments. The cores should have chain-link-fencing and patrolling guards; and systems established for removing nest predators.
 
 In case of  , the IUCN suggested that local livelihoods should be linked with bustard conservation in priority areas and the government should provide subsidies. 
 
 The government should establish a ‘Conservation Reserve’ or ‘Community Reserve’ and provide support and equipment to the staff for better protection of priority areas. The IUCN said that the government should consider conservation breeding programme as an insurance against extinction.
 
 In case of GIB, the IUCN said that the breeding programme will require at least 5-10 years, but the rapidly declining population trend provides a window of less than 5 years for procuring eggs from the wild, so the implementation of a conservation breeding programme would have to be taken up urgently. The IUCN also suggested regulation and control of eco-tourism to minimize disturbance to the species.
