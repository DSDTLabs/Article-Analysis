GURUGRAM: Three armed men allegedly stole a Toyota Fortuner from a 28-year-old man, who works for a private transport company, near MGF Metropolitan Mall on   on Thursday night. 

 However, police claimed CCTV cameras installed nearby did not capture any vehicle theft and that they were still verifying the driver’s version of the story.
 
 In his complaint, driver   said it was around 10pm when he was waiting in the Fortuner for his boss just outside the mall when three armed men came there and held him hostage. Then, they got into the car and drove towards Delhi. Finally, they pushed him out of the vehicle in a secluded place near Chhatarpur in Delhi and fled with the SUV, his wallet and mobile phone. 
 
 “CCTV cameras of the area did not show any robbery… the driver went alone in the car. The driver is under scanner and we are questioning him,” said inspector Gaurav Phogat, SHO, DLF 2 police station.
 
 On Wednesday, six armed men thrashed the driver of a Scorpio and then fled with the SUV, in another case of vehicle theft in Sector 81.
 
 Rajiv Dubey (32), originally from Kannauj in UP, who works as a driver for a Rajasthan-based businessman, was returning home to   village around 8.30pm when another Scorpion came from behind and intercepted his vehicle. Six men came out of the vehicle near Shahid Udham Singh Chowk in Sector 81 and put a gun to Dubey’s head. “One of them snatched my car keys while two others got into the car. After driving a few kilometres, they dumped me and fled,” Dubey told police.
 
 Six unidentified men have been booked under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnap), 395 (dacoity) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act at   police station.
