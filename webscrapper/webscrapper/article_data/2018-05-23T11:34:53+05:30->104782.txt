CHENNAI: The police on Monday night apprehended at least 12 people in   and seized one country-made bomb, six knives and sickles from them . The arrested, who police believe had holed up in the house waiting to target members of a rival gang, included Sethu who is a suspect in the May 9 murder of an elderly couple near Minjur.

 
 Sethu was involved in two other cases of murder and a few cases of attempted murder.
 
 The police team, which nabbed the 12 men following a specific tip, questioned each of them separately before a magistrate court in Ponneri sent them to jail.
 
 Sethu was among five men who waylaid Jayaraman, 67, and his wife when they were going on a bike from   to   village near   and attacked them when they resisted the robbery attempt. Jayaraman died and his wife and a passerby who tried to rescue the couple were injured.
