Similarly, traffic was halted for a while at Hasthampatty area after a traffic lamp post fell on the road due to heavy wind. Similarly, a huge banyan tree was uprooted at a temple in Hasthampatty.
 
 Rescue team consisting of revenue department officials, Tamil Nadu fire and rescue services personnel and police officials were formed to clear the debris and rescue the stranded people (if any) across the district.
 
 Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Namakkal and Erode districts also experienced good shower from Saturday evening. Rain lashed many parts of the district including Hosur, Burgur and Shoolagiri. 
 
 A private bus was damaged after a huge tree fell on it near Anna Park area. However, no one was injured. 
 
 The situation worsened after rain water entered many houses Kitchipalayam, Ammapet and Shevapet areas and uprooted trees fell on power cables thus suspending power supply.
 
 Moreover, sewage water mixed with rainwater and overflowed in almost all areas of the city. Water was stagnated on Cherry Road, Brindhavan Road and Gandhi Road causing inconvenience to the road users.
 
 The drainage channel across the city choked with rain water especially on Kitchipalayam Road, resulting in traffic congestion. Residents blamed the Salem Municipal Corporation for not cleaning the channels on a regular basis.
 
 Krishnagiri district collector C Kathiravan said the officials are monitoring the entire district and will rush to the area immediately after getting information.
