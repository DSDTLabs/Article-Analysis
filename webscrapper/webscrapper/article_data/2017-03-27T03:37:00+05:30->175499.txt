Margao: The recent political events in Goa, wherein one of the regional parties, Goa Forward, made a U-turn from its earlier stance against the BJP to join the latter, despite the party having lost the public mandate in the Goa assembly polls, was a big shock to the rest of the country, said Ganesh Devy, national convener of the   (DA), on Saturday.

 Speaking to the reporters, Devy applauded the resignation of former Goa Forward president Prabhakar Timble and “condemned the dubious role played by some DA core workers, who are also associated with the GFP, for misutilizing the DA platform during their national conference in 2016 to support Goa Forward”. He censured these members but refused to expel them from the non-political organization.
 
 Denying a split in the DA, Devy said, “Forces that curb freedom of expression and thought cannot be supported by us, as we are accountable to the people of Goa and India. We believe in fair exchange of thoughts, as well as diversity, and not coercion or thought policing. So our newly-formed organization will devise ways to prevent such incidents in future. The next DA national conference will be held in January 2018 in Nagpur.”
