LUCKNOW: At the formal launch of the   joint campaign here on Sunday,   and   said there was a “possibility” that they would keep their collaboration going for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well.

 The Yadav and Gandhi scions acknowledged the BJP as their common foe, and said their accord in UP would give an appropriate answer to the saffron party’s “politics of anger and hatred”, with Rahul saying, “An alliance in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 has not been discussed, but it is a possibility.”
 
 Playing a good host, Akhilesh let Rahul lead the show, only stepping in to say that UP results would play a decisive role in setting the tone for national politics, adding that he was confident that their alliance would win over 300 of the state’s 403 assembly seats.
 
 While taking to reporters, both Akhilesh and Rahul evaded replying to questions about Congress transiting from raising anti-SP slogan like, ‘27 saal UP behaal’ (27 years of hopelessness in UP) to ‘UP ko ye saath pasand hai’ (UP likes this partnership). Instead, the two political heirs harped on uniting to fight against the BJP and its communal agenda, while also ducking questions on whether Congress president Sonia Gandhi and SP patriarch   would campaign for their alliance.
 
 While Rahul said anyone who believes in their ideology was welcome, Akhilesh said he was happy that he had the blessings of the party elders.
