Mumbai: BEST general manager Jagdish Patil on Monday announced plans to reduce the   of red buses from 15 years to 12 years. This, according to him, will ensure that old and rattling buses are taken off the fleet and replaced with brand new vehicles.

 In 2012-13, the BEST boasted of a much younger fleet—over 1,000 buses were three to six years old and most of the remaining ones were just seven years old. But today, more than 56% of the 3,963-strong fleet is over eight years old. According to the latest BEST statistics, 298 buses are 12-13 years old, 214 are 13-14 years old and 122 are almost 15 years old. These will be scrapped soon to make way for the new ones. 
 
 It will also help improve the condition of buses and attract more commuters to the red buses, which has seen a 30% dip in passengers in the past seven years. “The present average life span of 3,800 non-AC buses in our fleet is 9.5 years. We are targeting to reduce the average age by less than 7 years,” Patil told TOI . In fact, he made a reference at the meeting that there were plans to make outright purchases of new vehicles and put the onus of annual maintenance on the supplier.
 
 “If you look at the condition of our old buses, we are sometimes helpless. On one hand, the manufacturer is unable to provide us spare parts for the old model or design of buses and on the other it is difficult and expensive to maintain these buses till they attain 15 years,” he said. MNS member Kedar Hombalkar demanded, “In view of the two recent fire incidents in a gap of 15 days, we need to conduct random checks of buses for maintenance at all 26 depots.” 
 
 Patil said that the first set of 100 new buses could arrive in March. “For nearly six years, there has been no purchase of new buses. I want to change this and replace the old fleet with the new,” he added.
