KOLKATA: Armed with a bonti 'looted' from a nearby chicken shop, thieves raided an ATM kiosk in Patuli in the early hours of Tuesday. When their efforts came to naught after hours of toil, the accused fled with six chickens kept at the same meat shop. 

 Police have registered a case and are investigating the break-in at the SBI ATM in Patuli's M Block. "Prima facie evidence suggests the crime took place between 3am and 5am. This surely is a unique case in my career," said an investigating officer.
 
 According to police sources, the accused had entered the chicken shop first. They broke open the cash box and took away the money. They then used the bonti to damage the CCTV camera fitted inside the kiosk but did not succeed in breaking open the ATM vault. They finally scampered away with six chickens. 
 
 A local resident, however, claimed that the robbery bid has been captured on his private CCTV camera and that he was ready to share it with police. "I have already spoken to cops about it," he said.
 
 Chicken shop owner Subrata Mandal said he was informed about the incident by one of his friends. "While the loss is not so much, I wonder why they took away my cash book. I even need a new bonti," he told TOI. 
 
 Police have contacted the bank. "We have asked the bank officials to count the money and give us in writing that nothing has gone missing. We have registered a suo motu case," said a senior officer from south suburban police division.
 
 "Keeping guards at night will raise the expenses. We are not thinking of that option. We have confident that the thieves will be nabbed soon," said an official from another bank where a similar attempt was made two months ago.
