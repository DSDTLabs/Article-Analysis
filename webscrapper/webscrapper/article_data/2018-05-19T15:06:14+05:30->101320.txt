NAGPUR: State discom MSEDCL’s special drive to collect mobile numbers of its non-agricultural consumers has borne fruit with the company now having numbers of 90% consumers in  . A year ago, the figure was an abysmal 27%. Even 40% farmers now have registered their numbers with MSEDCL.

 Regional director Bhalchandra   said that cell numbers of 95% consumers in Congress Nagar division of Nagpur were stored in the discom database. “We now communicate with our consumers about maintenance shutdowns and breakdowns and provide bill related information on mobiles. Now consumers can pay their bills at our collection centres by just showing the SMS received on their mobiles. Even if you do not get your electricity bill on time you can get prompt payment discount by paying the bill within seven days,” he added.
 
 Turning to other achievements of the discom in 2017-18, Khandait said that input of electricity in Vidarbha had increased by 2.8% while agricultural sale increased by 1.7%. “We have been accused to inflate sale of power to farmers for artificially reducing distribution losses. Activists said that while input increased by 5%, agricultural sales increased by 10%. Now every feeder is metered and farm power sale is showing genuine growth,” he added.
 
 There are about 4,000 11 KV feeders of MSEDCL in Vidarbha. “Readings of about 3,000 feeders is relayed to our server by modems. The readings of remaining feeders is taken through meter reading instruments (MRIs). The days of taking down readings manually are over. Our figures can no longer be questioned,” said Khandait.
 
 The distribution losses in the region has reduced from 14.6% in 2016-17 to 13.5% in 2017-18. “Collection efficiency has increased from 98.6% to 101.8% in a year. A 100% plus collection means that we are recovering arrears,” Khandait added.
 
 In 2017-18, MSEDCL’s regular staffers removed 3,685 hooks in Vidarbha and registered 377 cases against persons illegally drawing power through hooks. The number of meter tampering cases detected was 4,582 and the amount was Rs 10.83 crore. In addition, its vigilance wing detected 3,689 theft cases worth Rs 29.60 crore. Along with cracking down on power pilferage, MSEDCL has also replaced 1.35 lakh faulty meters.
