HYDERABAD:   accused   was released from Chanchalguda jail on Friday, a few days after a local court granted him conditional bail.

 This is Aseemanand's first time out on bail. He and six others were recently acquitted in the   dargah bomb blast case; however, two others -Devender Gupta and Bhavesh Patel -were convicted in the case.
 
 Though Aseemanand was granted bail, one of the conditions imposed by the court is that he cannot leave Hyderabad and Secunderabad.
 
 A few political parties protested in Hyderabad against the granting of bail to Aseemanand and Rateshwar.
