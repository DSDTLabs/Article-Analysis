NEW DELHI: A defiant   CM   rejected criticism of his government's decision to 
  and regulate meat trade, and said he was merely trying to enforce the law and there was no prejudice involved. 

 "I am doing nothing on my own. The National Green Tribunal in 2015 and the Supreme Court in 2017 have given many adverse observations on illegal butcher houses in the state and gave certain directions to the state. We have just followed those instructions. You cannot call illegal as legal," Yogi told RSS weekly 'Organiser'.
 
 He asserted that clear instructions were issued not to disturb those who had licences and were following norms. "No legal operator will be harassed, I can promise you that. Moreover, nobody can be allowed to play with the health of people of the state," Yogi said in his first interview to any publication after he took over UP's reins.
 
  
  
 
 The newly-inaugurated CM pledged to follow the policies and programmes of PM  , and said those criticising his elevation basically didn't like to see India's growth and progress. 
 
 He attributed the 
  in the state to organisational skills of BJP president Amit Shah.
 
 Yogi said BJP stood nowhere in 2012 but 2014 saw a big change. "The challenge was how we could channelise that upsurge in our favour in UP, so the BJP appointed Amit Shah for the task," Yogi said.
 
 On building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Yogi said, "I welcome the observations made by the Supreme Court. As the government is not party to it, so the two parties in contention should have a dialogue and resolve the matter. If any help of the state government is needed, we are ready to provide that." Yogi said his government would provide corruption-free administration and rid society of goonda raj. 
 
 The CM also said "misconceptions" have been created about him due to his saffron-clad look and promised to win hearts of "all sections" by spreading a new idiom of happiness and prosperity, a news agency reported .
