HUBBALLI: Chief minister   said, “We need not learn anything from those who watched blue films in the assembly session.” At a press conference in Koppal on Friday, Siddaramaiah said BJP leader B S Yedyurappa is making allegations about the misdeeds in the government, and threatening to reveal documents, but that he is an expert in telling lies. “Though we invited him to a debate on an open platform, he has not dared to take the challenge,” he said.

 Reacting to BJP leader Laxman Savadi’s statement, describing the Congress to be home to liars, the   said they do not need to be preached to by someone who watches blue films. The chief minister later addressed a public meeting, where he said that the government will soon provide Rs 2,265 crore for the 3rd phase of works of the Koppal lift-irrigation project under the Krishna-B scheme. “When we conducted a padayatra from Hosapete to Kudala Sangam before the assembly elections, we had assured of spending Rs 10,000 crore for   projects, and we have now spent Rs 60,000 crore in 5 years,” he claimed.
 
 He said his government has rejuvenated lakes at a cost of Rs 7,000 crore, and constructed 1.67 lakh   ponds. “With the intention of empowering rural youth to become doctors, we are setting up government medical colleges in all districts,” he added.
