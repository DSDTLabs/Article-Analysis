Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) had to award 15   to students appearing in the HSC science examination to increase the pass percentage which otherwise would have been only 62%, the poorest result of the decade, said sources in the education department. The overall pass percentage this year is 72.99%.

 According to sources, when the board realized that about 60% of seats in engineering colleges would go vacant, it allowed 15 grace marks to all. The board had to make changes in its rules for giving the grace mark. According to the board rules, only five marks was permissible as grace. 
 
 
 GSHSEB chairman A J Shah, however, refuted the contention and said, “We have given grace marks according to the rules and the board has already made the rules public on its website. According to the rules, only five grace marks can be given.”
 
 On poor results, education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that the board will analyze the results with those during semester system and find a way to improve the situation. “We will also find out why there was a drop in the pass percentage,” Chudasama said.
 
 This year, only 136 students scored A1 grade which was a drop of around 77% compared to 2017. In 2017, the number of students scoring A1 grade was 589. In 2016, the number was 763.
 
 There was also a drop in the number of students scoring A2 grade. The number of students getting over 81 percentile was only 3% this year which was over 5% in 2016. The number of schools with 100% result too has gone down by around 65%.
