 As per notification issued by the deputy commissioner of police ( traffic) under Motor Vehicle Act, section 115, 116 (1) (A) and (B), the around 450-metre long road stretching from Empire Estate to   cooperative housing societies has been allowed to start the odd and even date parking system. 
 
 The other road stretch of 300 metre starts from Star Daily to Swastik Traders. Both the roads are in sector 20 of Lharghar. 
 
 However, vehicles belonging to the police, fire brigade, ambulances and other emergency service vehicles are exempt from the rule.
 
 The DCP (traffic) order states, “Large number of vehicles move on these two roads, causing traffic snarls. Even garbage-lifting compactor vehicles and school buses are not able to ply on these two roads due to uneven parking of vehicles. 
 
 “Suggestions and objections were invited from residents before implementing the order. However, no objection was received against the proposed imposition of odd-even date parking.”
