NEW DELHI: In a fresh twist to the government versus  , urban development minister Satyendar Jain spoke about the “lack of punctuality” and wrote to Delhi   Anshu Prakash directing him to take   against officers coming late to work, including deducting their salary.

 Jain’s direction came after it was found during random inspection of attendance in various branches of the urban development department that 11 officials were absent even after 10.20am on May 4 and, most of the senior officers, who had marked their attendance, were not present in their seats.
 
 In the letter to chief secretary Anshu Prakash, the minister alleged that the quantum of work being delivered is “very less”, and “undoubtedly” this is the result of the decision of the officers to not let the government function properly. “They should be instructed to let the government function for the benefit of the public,” Jain wrote.
 
 Replying to Jain’s letter, the chief secretary wrote that the department will reiterate instructions for punctuality. “It is a fact that officers are working beyond office hours and even on weekends. Instead of making unwarranted and unsubstantiated allegation, the minister is requested to cite specific problems so that the same can be addressed,” Prakash said.
