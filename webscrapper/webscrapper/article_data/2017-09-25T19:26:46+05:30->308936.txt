RANCHI: Several men in the city were in for a surprise on Sunday morning when   (RMC) personnel forcibly took away their lungis as   for  . The clothes were given back only after they took a pledge never to answer the call of nature in the open.

 Part of RMC's campaign `Halla Bol Lungi Khol Abhiyan' which was launched on Sunday , this exercise is aimed to make the city open-defecation free (ODF). The civic body has set a deadline of September 30 to achieve its objective. While many people were made to ta ke the pledge, at least 20 men who were caught in the act were imposed a fine of Rs 100 each.
 
 
 
 
 “It was a drive to show people how embarrassing it can be when you defecate in the open.The people who were caught have toilets in their homes. We made them promise that from now on they will use toilets,“ RMC city manager Shashi Prakash said.
 
 Defending the RMC's campaign, Prakash said the beneficiaries have been provided money under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) to construct toilets. While many already have toilets at their homes, they still defecate in the open. “We have organised awareness drives and provided people with facili ties. It is time violators are punished,“ he added. Prakash said 50 wards have been made ODF while “work is in progress“ in another five wards. He warned that violators would face even more embarrassment in the days to come if they are caught by RMC personnel. “There are plans to take away the water vessel from them, make them do situps or drop them at a faraway point and make them walk home,“ Prakash added.
 
 There have been similar campaigns in the past in other places to force people to change their habit to defecate in the open. Last year, the district magistrate of Bijnore, UP , formed three teams comprising men, women and children who were armed with flashlights and whistles to single out those relieving themselves in the open.
