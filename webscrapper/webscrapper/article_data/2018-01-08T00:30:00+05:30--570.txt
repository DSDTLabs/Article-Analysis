Bengaluru: The fear of negative marking loomed large over the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for postgraduate medical seats held here on Sunday. 

 The PG medical aspirants, who appeared for the test, said some of the 300 questions were tricky. The paper struck a balance between clinical and non-clinical questions, they added.
 
 A strict checking of belongings and dress code, including restriction on the kinds of shoes candidates wore, gave the aspirants jitters. Some of them claimed that they were not allowed to carry pens to the exam centre citing security issues. 
 
  The deduction of one mark for every wrong answer, however, put students in the spot. tnn
