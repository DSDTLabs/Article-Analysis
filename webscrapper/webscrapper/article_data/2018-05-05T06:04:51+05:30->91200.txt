KOLKATA:   group firm   on Friday moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) challenging the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT),  , that instructed the resolution professional (RP) and the committee of creditors (CoC) to accept the revised bid of Ultra-Tech for   Cement. However, NCLAT has not stayed the judgment of NCLT Kolkata. The next hearing is on May 22.

 
 The counsel for Binani Operational Creditors Forum (BOCF), D Vussonji, said there was no stay on the NCLT order. “Now the RP and the   can accept the revised offer from UltraTech and the procedure can go on. Dalmia Bharat will have the chance to match the offer. If the latter matches the offer then, there would
 
 be an open bidding as per the NCLT order. However, the outcome of the May 22 hearing will have an impact on the outcome of the bidding,” he added.
 
 According to Vussonji, the implementation, however, can be done only with the leave of NCLAT.
 
 On Wednesday, the Kolkata Bench of the tribunal has given a clear direction to the resolution professional (RP) of Binani Cement to accept the revised offer of UltraTech Cement within three working days of the judgment. It has also ordered the RP to place the revised offer of UltraTech along with the resolution plan of the cement major before the CoC.
 
 The CoC led by Bank of Baroda and Edelweiss had earlier refused to consider the revised offer from UltraTech as it arrived after they decided on the highest bidder.
 
 The revised offer of Ultra-Tech along with the working capital requirement for Binani Cement is Rs 7,960 crore. Taking the working capital requirement into consideration, the final offer of Dalmia Cement Bharat (DCB) became Rs 6,930 crore. It is also learnt that the RP and the CoC would meet on Monday to consider the UltraTech revised offer.
