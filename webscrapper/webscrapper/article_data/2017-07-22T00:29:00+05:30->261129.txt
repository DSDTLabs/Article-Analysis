Nagpur: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Friday recalled its order levying Rs 100 per hoarding fine on Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for not lodging FIR against such structures. A division bench of Justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo also asked the civic body to file an affidavit within two weeks on action taken so far against illegal hoardings/posters and banners in the city. It further directed petitioner NGO Parivartan through president Dinesh Naidu to inform on new contempt by the corporation by submitting photographs of illegal structures in the same time. The court was hearing NGO’s contempt plea (No. 256/2010) through counsel Tushar Mandlekar pointing out that in spite of court’s orders, gross violation of ‘Outdoor Advertising Policy 2001’ was happening and the distance between two hoardings was not being maintained. The judges recalled their last order of imposing Rs 100 fine after NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik submitted that he had already filed an affidavit signed by then commissioner Shravan Hardikar in this regard last year. It contained entire data of five NMC zones. However, that affidavit was not reflected in the court record. Puranik expressed readiness to resubmit the affidavit but the judges said they would recall their orders believing his statement. Puranik earlier told the court NMC had taken action against many illegal hoardings and one hoarding of birthday greetings to the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was even published in TOI, but later it was found to be legal one. During the last hearing, the court flayed NMC officials for failure to lodge FIR against those putting up illegal hoardings/posters and banners, and slapped Rs 100 per structure charges on NMC commissioner. The orders came after petitioner’s counsel contended the corporation officials found over 1,700 illegal hoardings but lodged FIR against only a few of them thus violating court’s directives.
