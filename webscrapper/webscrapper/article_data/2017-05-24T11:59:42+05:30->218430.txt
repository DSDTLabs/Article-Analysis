Singer   is on the verge of deleting his   account after the social media site dispensed his friend-cum-Bollywood singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya’s account. Abhijeet was accused of using filthy and abusive language against renowned celebrities and after he recently posted a rather offensive tweet against JNU student  . 

 This wasn’t the first time that he received so much flak from Twitteratis. A journalist from a leading media house filed an FIR against his inflammatory tweets that targeted her last year in July, and reportedly the singer broke into tears on being released on bail. However, he still seemed to remain unchanged and posted a supremely crass tweet about Snehla which made his account get suspended.
  
  
 Following this controversy, his close friend Sonu Nigam took to Twitter to express his opinions on Abhijeet’s barred account and went on a rant about how unfair the whole scenario was. He posted a series of 24 tweets and said that he would be soon going off of Twitter in order to support Abhijeet Bhattacharya’s “not-so-offensive” opinions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Sonu Nigam was shocked to learn that   singer  's Twitter account was suspended and expressed how 90% of Twitter users abuse out in the open and yet no action is taken against them.
  
  
 Do you think it's wise to restore Abhijeet's account?
