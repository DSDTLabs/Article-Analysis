Rocker   is expanding his Third Man Records company by launching a Vinyl pressing plant next month. 

  
  
 Third Man Pressing, which will open on February 25 in White's native Detroit, Michigan, will house 'eight of the first newly built presses in 35 years'. According to sources, the facility will be able to produce 5,000 records-an-hour. 
 
 White was also thinking about environmental safety when he built the plant, which will be the "only fully climate-controlled pressing plant work environment in the world," and made sure it would run using a "closed-loop, chilled-water system that maximizes water sustainability". 
 
 The 41-year-old will host opening day performances at the pressing plant and will sell exclusive merchandise, including a limited-edition vinyl and the first record printed on opening day. Third Man Pressing will print releases from The White Stripes star's label as well as other record companies. In addition to the pressing plant, viewing platforms and tours will be open to the public.
