BENGALURU: The BDA on Thursday decided that   Layout allottees should be given 60 more days to make  .

 The   had demanded more time to deposit the money as they said the time given wasn't enough to mobilise 10% of the site value. The amount ran into lakhs of rupees and allottees petitioned the BDA for more time. Arkavathy allottees will be given the option of acquiring equivalent-sized plots in the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout at the old rates. 
 
 Since the cost of sites in   (most allottees paid 12 years ago) is substantially lower than those in KG Layout, allottees were worried about having to pay the difference. “We'll begin informing allottees about it,“ said BDA commissioner Rajkumar Khatri, adding: “We won't give them direct sale deeds, but will restrict ourselves to the old system of a lease-cum-sale deed.“
