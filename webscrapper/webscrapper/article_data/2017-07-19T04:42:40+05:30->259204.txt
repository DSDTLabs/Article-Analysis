GHAZIABAD: The   conducting an audit of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has raised objections on the construction of the Ala Hazrat  , and has sought clarifications from the Authority. 

 The CAG team has reportedly objected to the construction of Haj House as a three-storeyed building, when only one storey was permitted in the original layout plan. The team has also sought details from the GDA on whether it was constructed in a Hindon floodplain area, in violation of environmental norms.
 
 Speaking to TOI, GDA secretary   said, “The CAG team has information on the status of the land on which the Haj House was constructed, as a plea has been filed in   (NGT) saying it was constructed on Hindon floodplains.” Seeking to downplay the issue, Godbole said that a reply has been given to CAG team but there a final meeting with CAG officials is due before it prepares a final report.
 
 Earlier, the CAG team had put about 200 GDA appointments under the scanner, for which they had questioned GDA officials.
 
 Haj House, which was inaugurated by former chief minister   in September last year, hit rough weather from the start, after an NGO filed a plea with the NGT seeking to stay the construction of Haj House as it was being built near Hindon river. 
 
 The NGT had then issued notices to the state government and other agencies, seeking a status report over the matter. 
 
 In its plea, the NGO had accused the GDA of altering the land use to pave way for the construction of Haj House. Built across four acres, about Rs 40 crore was spent for its construction. With the CAG raising objections on its construction, GDA is sure to be put on the spot, sources told TOI.
