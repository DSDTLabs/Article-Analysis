Erode: Two persons, one of them a woman, were killed and another one was injured after a truck laden with coconut shell rammed the car they were travelling in near Kodumudi here on Tuesday night. 
 
 The deceased were identified as P Ramesh, 45, of Velayuthampalayam in Karur district and his relative Sundarambal, 70. Ramesh’s father K Palanisamy, 69, who was also travelling in the car, escaped with minor injuries. 
  
 According to police, Ramesh, a contract labourer with a private company in Karur, had on Tuesday gone to his mother-in-law’s house at Kolathupalayam village near Unjalur in Erode district, along with Palanisamy and Sundarambal. The accident took place when the trio was returning to Velayuthampalayam at night. 
  
 When the car neared Kodumudi on Salaipudur-Noyyal state highway, a coconut shell laden truck suddenly rammed the car. “The truck’s front tyre got punctured following which its driver lost control over the vehicle and rammed the car,” the Kodumudii police said. 
  
 The truck driver, however, managed to flee soon after the accident and his identity is yet to be ascertained. 
  
 The trio was critically injured in the incident and seeing them battling for life, passersby immediately rushed them to the government hospital in Kodumudi. After giving first-aid, the three were referred to the Erode government hospital. 
  
 “Sundarambal and Ramesh succumbed to their injuries on the way to the Erode government hospital,” the police said. Palanisamy was, meanwhile, admitted to the government hospital in Erode, where doctors said his condition was stable. 
  
 The police have registered a case and further investigation is on. Ramesh is survived by his wife Jayasudha, 40, and a four-year-old daughter, they added.
