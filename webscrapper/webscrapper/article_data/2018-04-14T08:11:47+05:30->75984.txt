BENGALURU: Some took to the street while several others expressed outrage on social media. But Bengaluru made it clear on Friday that inaction won’t be tolerated in the gangrape and murder of the 8-old in  , Jammu and Kashmir.

 A group of citizens gathered at   on Friday evening to protest the heinous crime. Several civil society organisations will meet on Saturday to discuss their protest plans for next week.
 
 Advocate and member of People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Bindu Doddahatti, said: “It is clear that the bar association which supported the accused is backed by the RSS and  . It was an organised crime and they wanted to drive out the minority community from the place.”
 
 Bindu said such acts are perpetrated to create fear; the incident is political and needs to be condemned through collective action of society.
 
 Citizens and activists from various walks of life have criticized the incident and condemned the leaders who are making it a political issue. K S   of Janavadi Mahila Sangha said she was shocked to see BJP leaders trying to defend the accused. “If responsible agencies like police and the state government acted impartially, the issue wouldn’t have taken a political hue. An elected government should take a stand to protect its citizens’ rights and not allow such acts to acquire communal colour,” she said.
 
 Sidharth, a student, posted on Facebook it was shocking that such a crime was committed just to “get a communal message across.” “The shocking involvement of police officers in this case makes me lose my faith in the state...This case should be treated as a rarest of rarest case,” he wrote.
