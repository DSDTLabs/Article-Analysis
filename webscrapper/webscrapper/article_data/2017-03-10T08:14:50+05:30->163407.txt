NEW DELHI: Following criticism,   on Thursday closed a counter set up exclusively to facilitate treatment for "VIPs" and the patients recommended by the Union health minister's office. 

 The move came after Union health minister   expressed displeasure over the initiative taken by the AIIMS administration, hospital sources said.
 
 The faculty association of AIIMS (FAIIMS) on Wednesday had condemned the move alleging it was an "brazen attempt" on part of the administration to "promote VIP culture" in the institute's premises.
 
  Chief minister   took to Twitter to blame the Modi government of working for only VIPs. "Modi govt works for only VIPs, AAP govt works for only aam admi," he had tweeted. 
 
 AIIMS had opened the exclusive counter to facilitate the registration for treatment of patients recommended by the Officer on Special Duty ( ) to the Union health minister and VIP references from members of parliament.
 
  The faculty members claimed the practice was prevalent even before and was being dealt by the media and protocol division, but not in such an open manner. At present, AIIMS witnesses an overwhelming footfall of around 11,000 patients across all OPDs daily.
