 “Under Section 130 of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, notices are being issued to all property owners who have not paid their taxes. It is mandatory for every property owner to pay their taxes and clear all arrears. Funds generated from tax collection will only be utilised in developing the city’s infrastructure. The civic body is empowered to seal and attach moveable and immovable properties of defaulters. Strict action will be taken against them for non-compliance of instructions,” said   commissioner V Umashankar.
 
 He said that property owners can use the MCG portal (www.mcg.gov.in) to make payments, or pay through UPI and debit and credit cards. “They can also visit the Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) located opposite Civil Hospital and at the MCG office, Infocity, Sector 34, for the purpose. Alternatively, they can also deposit the amount at all Axis bank branches. All that they need to do is generate a challan from the MCG portal and deposit the tax at the bank branches,” he said.
