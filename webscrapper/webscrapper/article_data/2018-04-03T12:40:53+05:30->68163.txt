GURUGRAM: Around 20,000 consumers availing Piped natural gas services from   in   will be charged higher for their connections as HCG has hiked the rates in wake of skyrocketing fuel rates across the country. On the heels of soaring international oil rates, petrol prices hit a four year high on Monday leading to a revision of administered pricing mechanism (APM) by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG).

 Taking a cue, the HCG has hiked the rates of CNG by 1 Rs/kg and   (household) by RS 1.25 per standard cubic meters (scm). HCG does not vend the cylinders. It provides PNG services to household in the city and has around 25 CNG stations across Gurgaon for automobiles.
 
 “Keeping in view of recent increase in APM Price by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG),   has increased the CNG and PNG (Household) price with effect from 3rd April, 2018 from 6 am onwards,” a handout from the HCG read. “The new CNG and PNG (Household) prices would be as follows: CNG - Rs. 47.75/Kg and PNG (Household) - Rs. 27.75/SCM. The increase in CNG price would be Rs. 1.00/kg and that of PNG (Household) would be Rs. 1.25/SCM.”
 
 Spokesperson from   Gas said they currently had 20,000 consumers in the Gurugram city. “We don’t provide cylinder services so the hike would reflect across the PNG connections that we have right now,” he said. “Besides, from today 6 am onwards, the all our CNG stations in Gurgaon will be selling the gas as per revised price.”
 
 HCG also has around 150 industrial connections and over 500 kms of pipeline network in the city.
 
 Currently, there are 25 CNG fuel stations located in Gurugram in sectors 14, 15(I), 15(II), 22, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 44, 49, 52, 53, 53(II), 57, 62, 72A, 86, 89, 98, Alipur, IOCL sector, Sohna, Palwal Road, the bus depot, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar.
