HYDERABAD: From just 2-3%   related eye-ailments recorded couple of years ago, the cases have now touched 20%. Diabetic eye diseases include diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema (DME), cataract, and glaucoma. While diabetes is known to impact the eyes first, the number of diabetes related eye problems, especially those involving the retina, are increasing rapidly. This is because of a rise in the overall incidence of diabetes and awareness on the link between eye-health and diabetes. 

 With growing awareness even reverse phenomenon, where diabetes is being detected by looking at the eye health, is also being observed.
 
 "In many cases, we have been able to detect diabetes in patients who had come to us for an eye check-up. Many cases of diabetes-related retinal problems are being referred from districts as well," said Dr S  , superintendent,   Eye Hospital. The hospital, on an average, gets 200 patients each day with diabetes related issues.
 
 Among all the complication that diabetes cause, vision loss due to a diabetic retinopathy is most common. "Diabetic retinopathy, like glaucoma, is a silent killer of the eye sight and many people remain unaware that diabetes has affected their eyesight until damage reaches an advanced stage. Unfortunately, physicians and endocrinologists, who are the first line of doctors attending to diabetic patients, do not advise for diabetic eye screening though screening is the most effective way to manage and treat retinopathy," said Dr Jyotsna Myneni, retina and uveitis specialist, KIMS hospitals.
 
 The risk is more in patients with co-existing problems of BP, kidney ailments, anaemia and smoking. Also, risk is high for those who have had diabetes for over 7 years.
