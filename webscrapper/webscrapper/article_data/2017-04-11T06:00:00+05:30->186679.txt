Visakhapatnam: Basic amenities like adequate drinking water, proper sanitation, streetlights and individual toilets are absent in   despite the area being close to Dwarakanagar RTC Complex and city railway station. The local residents frequently suffer from health problems due to unhygienic surroundings as a result of piled up solid waste and dirty drainage canals leading to mosquito and rodent menace.

 Nearly 2,000 people reside in the area falling under GVMC ward number 30.
 
 “The civic authorities are yet to provide us with the basic amenities despite several representations by us. The locality has earned a negative reputation due to its unhygienic surroundings. GVMC workers dug up the road and side canals last month and then left the work incomplete. The corporation should take steps to improve the roads and sanitation,” said P Srinivas, a local resident.
 
 PU Siva, a paan shop owner near the vegetable market, said, “The all residents have GVMC’s water supply channels at home, but lack of proper water supply has rendered them useless. There are no dustbins in the area also as a result of which we are forced to dump waste along the roads. The drains are in need of extensive cleaning.” 
 
 However, another resident K Suresh said the corporation workers had placed a dustbin in front of the GVMC school. “Many residents continue to dump waste in front of the school despite the dustbin being there. Some people even defaecate openly near the bin. GVMC must take a note of this issue,” he said.
 
 A senior GVMC official said the corporation takes special attention of the area as it is one of the areas prone to vector-borne diseases. “The public should also pay attention to keep their area clean and green. Unless there is support from the local residents, development works taken up by GVMC will never succeed,” the officer added.
