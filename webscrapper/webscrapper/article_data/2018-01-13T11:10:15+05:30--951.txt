DUMRAON/PATNA: Chief minister   on Friday inaugurated and laid stones of schemes worth Rs 168 crores at   in Buxar district and another 63 schemes worth Rs 228 crore at   in   district on Friday.

 The CM was at Nandan and Ahinaura as part of his state-wide Vikas Sameeksha Yatra. “I am not the one who runs the government sitting in the state capital... I prefer to personally assess the ground realities and ensure that the basic amenities like roads, clean water and power reach every village and locality,” he said.
 
 Earlier as the CM’s convoy entered the Yadav-dominated Nandan panchayat, a group of people standing near a heap of bricks outside a bamboo orchard rained stones on the convoy. 
 
 Referring to the incident in his speech at a public meeting at Nandan, an angry   ordered a probe into the protests and hinted it was plotted by certain vested interests. “Some people are pursuing the politics of provocation and instigation against me as my government’s initiatives aimed at the state’s development were harming their selfish interests,” he said and added he didn’t bother about such people.
 
 The CM spoke at length about his mission against alcoholism and dowry and child marriage. He also talked about the measures taken for the skill development of the youths to get them better job opportunities.
 
 “We implemented liquor prohibition in   on women’s demand. It has laid the foundation for a positive change in the society. Those who were wasting money on liquor, are now spending it on their family’s welfare,” Nitish said.
 
 The CM called upon the villagers to participate in large numbers in the human chain to be formed on January 21 for spreading awareness against dowry and child marriage. “Take a pledge that you will stand for half an hour on January 21 to show your support to the campaign against these social evils,” he said.
