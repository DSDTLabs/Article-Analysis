Hyderabad: Dreaded rowdy-sheeter Mohammed   Khan obtained a passport with false details under the tatkaal scheme with the help of an agent, the Special Investigation Team has found.

 Sources told TOI that the gangster with the help of the agent got fake documents, including voter ID, ration card and proof of birth. He had given false details about his parents too.
 
 Police said he put down his father’s name as Sayeeduddin Khan. He is in fact the son of Jahangir Khan, an ex-serviceman. He also faked his date of birth. Police said Ayub was born in 1971 but fake documents record his year of birth as 1977.
 
 A case of cheating and forgery has been registered against Ayub Khan after the owner of the house at Golconda, Asyia Siddiqua, filed a complaint.
 
 The passport that was obtained with false details under the tatkaal scheme pending police verification. Sources said that as special branch sleuths were unable to locate the passport applicant they rejected the application as ‘not recommended’. After the rejection, the passport could have been impounded by the authorities immediately but this did not happen.
 
 An 11-member team led by Charminar assistant commissioner of police K Ashok Chakravarthy on Saturday visited the Golconda Bada Bazaar area in connection with the investigation. Police are now trying to identify the agent who helped Ayub procure the fake passport.
