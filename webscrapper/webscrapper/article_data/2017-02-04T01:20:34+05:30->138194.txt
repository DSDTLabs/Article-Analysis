RAIPUR: A day after proceeding on “medical leave”, controversial   IGP S R P Kalluri took to Whatsapp to clarify his stand, saying “the governments have to accommodate conflicting interests and take care of all diverse views in a healthy democracy”. He felt forces that threaten internal security should be dealt with in an uncompromising manner.

 “I have proceeded on medical leave on my own. I beg to deny reports that I was forcefully sent on leave,” said the IPS officer. “As a public servant, I respect all the decisions of the government. The government of  , especially the CM, has always supported me and my family for which we shall be ever grateful,” he said. “I sincerely request everyone to end the discussion of my posting and concentrate on the future course of action to tackle Maoism, as we are almost on the verge of winning this war against serial killings and senseless violence,” he added.
 
 Kalluri’s clarification comes at a time of intense speculation that the government had posted a new DIG to take care of the seven districts of Bastar following a number of controversies. The   had recently taken a dim view of alleged human rights violations during anti-Naxalite operations in the district. Various activist groups had also complained to the NHRC that activists, lawyers and journalists were being intimidated in Bastar.
 
 Meanwhile, officials said the state government had taken very seriously the resurgence of vigilante groups that have been threatening social and civil rights activists and accusing them of being Maoist sympathisers. The last straw was the controversy over the threat to activist Bela Bhatia who was asked by a group named “Agni” to leave Bastar.
