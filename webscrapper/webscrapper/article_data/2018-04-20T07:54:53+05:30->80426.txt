HYDERABAD: Ironic as it may seem, after attending to patients for 8-10 hours daily, female resident doctors staying at the   in the   campus have a major daily chore at hand — trudging to the nearby hostels or mess to fetch drinking water.

 Many of these medicos can be seen queued up outside other hostels or the nearby mess with buckets and cans during the morning and afternoon hours on any given day.
 
 The senior residents’ hostel building, which came up about six months back, has been devoid of a drinking water source since it was constructed, forcing   and senior residents to rely on water from either the nearby mess or other hostels.
 
 “There is no drinking water supply in our hostels and even the water purifier in the hostel has been out of order for months now. There is no other option but to carry water back to our rooms,” said one of the PG doctors, who had to rush back from her hospital duty to fill up a bucket of water.
 
 “We sometimes bargain with each other for carrying the buckets, especially if we have shifts ending in the evening hours. And these days, it’s such an effort to carry water due to the heat,” complained another resident doctor.
 
 Though an   was to be installed at the hostel and the contractor was paid Rs1.8 lakh for it, he left the students in the lurch despite several reminders and notices by the authorities.
 
 When contacted, Prof N Vani, in-charge principal,   Medical College, said, “As soon as students told us about this problem, it was taken up. The contractor has been citing health issues for the delays in installing the RO plant. He was given several reminders and now I have given him an ultimatum to complete the work at the earliest or have his contract cancelled. We are also considering blacklisting him and removing him from the maintenance contract if he delays any further.”
 
 As per insiders, after the latest warning three days ago, the contractor has begun work on the RO plant installation a day ago.
