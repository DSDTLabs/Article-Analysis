Bhama is all excited these days about a recent experience she had, playing a visually-challenged girl throughout her Kannada film  , a love story. 

 To make her character Anu authentic she had to imitate not just the eye movements, but the body language of a blind person, she says. Ask her how she managed it and she says, 'The director and I visited blind schools, observed and interacted with the students there as homework. We realised that their body language is completely different. A grown woman, for example, doesn't know she is all grown up and some of her mannerisms would resemble that of a child. I got cues from all this and have tried to work it out in the film. It was strenuous for my eyes but I have done my best,' she says.
 
 In the film, her character is from a wealthy family while the boy she falls in love with is from a poor family. 'But it is not a usual rich girl-poor man love story. The film is set in the 50s and so the clothes we wear are all of that era. The boy she falls in love with is also visually challenged. They create a beautiful world of their own which is accessible to none else,' Bhama says. 
 
  The film will release in February. And after doing the movie, she says she wants to go on a break. 'I need some time to get away from Anu. I'm listening to scripts in Malayalam as well as Kannada but I will be taking something up only after a break.'
