NEW DELHI: Some male volunteers of DCW's 'Rape Roko' campaign on Tuesday walked the streets of the capital wearing only their boxer shorts to give the message that 'clothes do not cause rape, sick mentality does'. 

 The   (DCW) had launched the 'Rape Roko' campaign after the brutal rape of an eight-month-old baby in January.
 
 The volunteers marched from   to Central Park carrying boards and placards with slogans like "Her clothes are not short, your mentality is" and "What clothes was the eight-month-old baby wearing?" - in a bid to challenge the mentality that tends to shame the survivors.
 
 The protesters expressed anger against the silence of society and government on rapes and appealed people to join the movement and reach Central Park, Connaught Place at 9.30am on March 8 to form a peaceful human chain.
 
  They demanded strong action against rapists and completion of trials in case of sexual assault within six months. 
 
 Abhishek, a student of Delhi University, said, "I am walking half-naked but society allows me to. If a girl walks in a sleeveless top, men letch at her. This is not right."
 
 Another protester, Jatin, had a placard that read 'I feel safe in these Boxers. How much fabric does she need to feel safe?' Many girls also attended the rally to extend their support to the cause.
 
 The   and the district court bar associations in Delhi have also extended their support to the campaign.
 
 In a letter to DCW chief Swati Jaihind, the IMA had said: "We strongly support the people's movement 'Rape Roko' launched by DCW chief to demand a robust criminal justice system which ensures cases of sexual crimes against women and children are tried by fast-track courts within six months and rapists of children are essentially accorded death penalty as a strong deterrent for others against such crimes".
