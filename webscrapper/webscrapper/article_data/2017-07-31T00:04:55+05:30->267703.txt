Reality star   somehow manages to grab headlines every other week for reasons good, bad and ugly. And while at it, he’s also managed to develop quite an attitude, we hear. So recently, it was the team of a celeb chat show that was at the receiving end of his high-handed ways. Apparently, Pratham gave a glimpse of his   even as he was getting ready for the show in the vanity van. Exasperated with his behaviour, the team, it is said, made it known to him that this unsavoury behaviour was not acceptable and that he had to adhere to the format of the show — be lively and fun. Further, when he finally made it to the couch, Pratham apparently replied in monosyllables for the initial round of questions. He also dragged  , the other guest on the show, into uncalled for situations. By the end of it, the verdict was unanimous that our man Pratham was one of the most difficult guests they’ve handled on the show. “In short, we got a glimpse of Lord Pratham, his famous act from   that day,” says a source from the set.
