NEW DELHI: The   filed on Tuesday its first chargesheet under the   against 37-year-old Mumbai businessman  , who was arrested for threatening to hijack a Mumbai-Delhi bound   flight on October 30 last year. 

 According to the Act, amended in 2016 to include even making threats of “hijacking” a serious offence, Salla could face life imprisonment along with fine. NIA spokesman   said Salla alias Amar Soni has been charged under section 3 (1), 3(2) and 4(b) of the Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016, which deals with intentionally seizing or exercising control of an aircraft in service by force or threatening to hijack the plane. 
 
 “After investigation, it has been established that accused Birju Salla, who travelled in the business class of the Jet Airways flight 9W339 on October 30, 2017 from Mumbai prepared a ‘threat note’ in ‘English’ and ‘Urdu’ language and he intentionally placed it in the tissue paper box of the toilet near the business class thereby jeopardized the safety of the passengers and crew members on board,” said Mittal. 
 
 According to sources, NIA has claimed in its chargesheet that Salla wanted to defame the private airline and have its operation discontinued so as to teach a lesson to a woman friend working for the airline. Salla had disclosed during his interrogation that he first compiled the material for the threat letter on his laptop and used some software to translate it into Arabic. 
 
 He later took a printout and carried it with him in the flight before placing it in the toilet, said an NIA official. “He claimed he wanted his female friend to know the consequences of not agreeing to live with him. He thought she could lose her job this way as Jet's operations would be closed and the airline would be defamed,” said the officer.
