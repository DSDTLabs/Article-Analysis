 The prices of pulses have been high since Diwali. Prices of Chana dal had reached Rs 150 in October 2016. The high prices had hurt the monthly budget of lowe-middle class and middle class people. 
 
 City-based retailer  , said, "The excessive production and supply have played an equal role in reducing the prices of pulses. The price of Urad dal has reduced by 50% to Rs 80 from Rs 160 during the period last year." 
 
 He added, "Even the cost of Chana dal has done down from Rs 140 to Rs 90. The prices of Tur dal has also plummeted by 60% to Rs 60 from Rs 140. The cost of Moong dal has also reduced to Rs 70."
 
 He further added, "Prices of pulses may increase in the month of April and May when the consumers buy pulses in bulk for the whole year. But, the procurement of goods by big food chains in bulk disturbs the price chain. Hence, there is an increased need to keep the prices in control."
 
 The president of Kolhapur traders and industrialist forum  , said, "The increase in the production and supply have pushed the dal prices downwards. Situation will remain the same for the next two to three months. The prices of pulses were much high in the same period last year owing to low production. This trend will remain the same till May. Then prices are likely to increase."
 
 He added, "  generally choose a crop based on its demand and price. Last year prices shot up owing to low rains. Therefore, the pulses were sown on the land belts. However, the demand remained similar to last year. As a result, the market is filled with excessive pulses, which has ultimately resulted in price fall."
