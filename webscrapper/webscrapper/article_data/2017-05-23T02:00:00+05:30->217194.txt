PATNA: Authorities of   on Monday suspended Rajesh Kumar, a clerk posted in the institution’s general administrative department, on the charge of committing irregularities while enrolling two girl students in the MSc zoology department.

 The college has asked Rajesh to explain within a week as to how he registered two students against a particular roll number in the MSc zoology department.
 
 The matter came to light when some students of zoology department complained to the college administration regarding the forged admissions. The fraud was detected after the college verified admission records on the basis of students’ complaint. 
 
 Principal of the college Shashi Pratap Shahi said some MSc zoology students met him recently and complained about forged admission of two girls against the roll numbers of two other existing students.
 
 “An emergency meeting was held with the college staff to discuss the issue. Later, a three-member committee comprising   (physics teacher),   Kumari and   (both zoology teachers), was formed to investigate the matter. The committee found that two students – Khushboo Kumari and Kritika – were enrolled in the MSc zoology department through fraudulent means. It held Rajesh guilty of facilitating the twin admissions,” the principal said, adding the college will lodge an FIR against him and cancel the admission of the two students.
 
 The college administration has also decided to verify the admission records of enrolled students in other departments.
