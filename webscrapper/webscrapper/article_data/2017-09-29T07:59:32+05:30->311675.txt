PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Angry relatives of a patient smashed the glass door of the intensive care unit (ICU) unit at the civic-run   at Pimpri on Thursday afternoon. They alleged that the man died because he did not receive timely treatment. 

 Speaking to TOI on Thursday, MM Deshmukh, superintendent of the hospital said, “It was a minor incident that was caused by the sudden death of patient named Datta Torad. He was a resident of Walhekarwadi in Chinchwad. He got a heart attack due to which the family members took him to a private hospital in Chinchwad. Later he was brought to YCM hospital at 9.45 am. He was admitted to the ICU but died around 12.45 pm.”
 
 He added that the body has been sent for the post mortem around 3pm. 
 
 Anand Kshirsagar, a relative said, “Torad aged 38 years was a labourer. He complained of chest pain in morning. So he went with his son to a private hospital in Chinchwad for treatment. He was referred to YCM hospital for further treatment. Here he was admitted into the ICU after nearly two hours at noon as there was no vacant ICU bed. He would have survived if he had received quick treatment on arrival at the hospital. He was declared dead at 12.50 pm.”
 
 He added that the relatives decided to take the body to Sassoon hospital for post mortem as they did not trust the doctors at YCM hospital. 
 
 Another relative said, “Torad had migrated from his native village in Osmanabad district around 15 years back to Pimpri Chinchwad city. He is survived by wife, son Ashish and two daughters- Gayatri and Gauri. Ashish is a college student while the two daughters are school students.”
 
 Anil Roy, medical officer of health(MOH), PCMC could not be contacted inspite of repeated attempts.
