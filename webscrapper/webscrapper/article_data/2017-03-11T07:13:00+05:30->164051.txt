MUMBAI: An   has found that 60% material tested last year during the monsoon proved to be a washout. BMC on Friday, in a presentation on measures to make roads pothole-proof this monsoon, informed Bombay high court that the expert committee had tested products of five vendors on site during the 2016 monsoon, only to find that three did not survive the rains. This year, traffic cops will share CCTV footage to identify potholes, the court was told.

 The expert committee, comprising members of Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), was formed pursuant to orders of the HC in a suo motu PIL of 2013 on the crater malaise on  . BMC plans to relay “long stretches’’ of road before the 2017 monsoon. It wants to adopt the technology of two vendors who passed muster by manufacturing material at its own plants. 
 
 The HC bench of Justices V M Kanade and P R Bora asked how Thane and Navi Mumbai roads were better. Civic counsel Anil Sakhare said there were newer. At the hearing, representatives of Thane and Navi Mumbai corporations, and other government agencies were present. Mumbai additional civic chief, Sanjay Deshmukh, said given “high traffic density’’, BMC requires other agencies to cooperate and bear inconvenience before the monsoon, when trenching would be stopped.
 
 BMC will launch numbers in May for residents to text in complaints. Kamal Khata, advocate for affected residents, said BMC’s app for grievances was not up to the mark and added that “ward officers giving incorrect report on repair work may be made accountable”. Advocate Jamshed Mistry, amicus curiae, said even citizens ought to play a role during inspection of potholes.
 
 The HC said it would monitor the work and hoped that the Mumbai agencies get their act together, like in Thane and Navi Mumbai.
