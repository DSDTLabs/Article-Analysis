NOIDA: Ruling out the possibility of joining   or any other front, expelled   leader   Siddiqui hinted that he would form a new front within a few days after taking suggestions from his supporters.

 “We are taking suggestions from all our supporters. The front will be formed within 10-15 days,” he told TOI.
 
 When asked if the “front” would be a political party, he said that the suggestions are being sought to figure out the same. When asked by reporters citing example of ex-BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who joined the BJP after promising the formation of a new front and his meeting with the CM, he said that his meeting with CM Yogi Aditya Nath on May 15 was held only to demand security and there were no talks about his joining the party. “As I have already said, I met CM Yogi because there is a threat to me, my family and my supporters from a certain gang,” he said.
 
 Supporters from Meerut, Agra, Saharanpur etc were present at the meeting.TNN
