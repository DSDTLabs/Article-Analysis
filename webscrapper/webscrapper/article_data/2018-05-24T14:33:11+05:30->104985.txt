COIMBATORE: As the   to   commenced on Friday, there were only a few takers for computer science, while many preferred accountancy and commerce groups to biology.

 “After the introduction of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, the chances of getting into a medical college has drastically reduced. And engineering graduates are already struggling for a job. Then why should we strain so much,” asked R Nivas, who has secured 430 marks in Class X.
 
 Accountancy group is not only easy to secure good marks, but also it would be helpful during higher education, he said, adding that he was doubtful about securing a seat in his choice of school. 
 
 While the cut off mark for biology and computer science groups was set at 400, students who have scored over 380 marks were given first preference to other groups, said an official with a reputed city school.
 
 The schools are likely to give first preference to the students, who completed Class X with them, and the outside students would be admitted based on first come first serve basis, a source said.
 
 “I want to become a doctor. If I ever change my mind, I could always enrol for other courses,” said R Savitha, who has secured 459 marks in the Class X examination, justifying her reason to opt for biology group.
