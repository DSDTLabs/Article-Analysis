TRICHY:   leader and MP Anbumani   on Saturday insisted on the closure of oil wells in Thanjavur district following the leakage of crude oil from the pipeline and spillover in the farmland at Kathiramangalam. 

 “The miseries caused to the people by the leakage of crude oil from the pipelines for seven km from Kathiramangalam to   are numerous. Considering the safety of the general public and to safeguard the cultivable land,   should close all the oil wells in Kathiramangalam and exit,” said Anbumani in a statement. 
 
 He put forth his demand in the backdrop of another incident of crude oil leak. The leaked crude oil from the pipeline at Madhagadi caused damage to the paddy crops in the land owned by a farmer Natarajan on Friday. The crude was being passed to the ONGC refinery unit in Kuthalam to the wells in Kathiramangalam. 
 
 Though the leak was arrested temporarily, there was no replacement of the pipelines done. There were incidents of fire breaking out on the spot, said Anbumani. 
 
 Terming the oil leakage and spill over on the farmland a regular affair since 2002, the PMK MP said that ONGC failed to keep up their assurance to fix the leakage problem permanently. 
 
 He also wondered whether the state government would provide compensation to the loss incurred by the farmer due to the damage caused to his crop by the crude oil. “People of Kathirmangalam have been protesting against the oil wells from May 20 last year. With the protest reaching 345th day today (Saturday), the state government which should explain to the central government and ONGC about the situation remains the protector of the violations of the ONGC,” charged Anbumani.
 
 Underlining the practices of developed countries avoiding laying of crude oil pipelines in residential areas, Ramadoss said that the pipeline of ONGC in Kathiramangalam was unsafe to the people.
