PUNE: The Symbiosis International University and Association of Indian Universities on Sunday submitted a list of recommendations for internationalising higher education to the Union ministry of human resource development.

 The recommendations were the result of a round-table discussion between 50 vice-chancellors from universities across the country and other experts. They included providing autonomy to deserving universities, creating an umbrella   to regulate higher education, encouraging smoother passage of incoming international students and creating an environment which is conducive to the return of Indian faculty from abroad.
 
 They were submitted to HRD minister   on Sunday during his visit to SIU.
 
 Former chairman of   Ved Prakash said, “There is a need to make Indian education globally competitive. For that, more centres of excellence and considerations such as a framework for globalisation, governance and sustainability of global universities must be drafted.”
 
 Jamil Salmi, expert at Global Tertiary Education and a member of the panel to draft recommendations said, “Governance is the biggest challenge for India, especially in public universities. There is a need for granting more institutional autonomy and flexibility in university structures.”
 
 Mamta Rani Agarwal, joint secretary of UGC spoke about research, governance and funding being key parameters to define world class universities. She also emphasised on the need for the provision of a level playing field for both private and public universities.
 
 Furqan Qamar, secretary general of Association of Indian Universities, said resources are extremely important for the smooth functioning of universities. He pointed out that instead of limiting the number of institutes of eminence to only 20, the framework must include a larger number of universities that have the potential to become world class.
