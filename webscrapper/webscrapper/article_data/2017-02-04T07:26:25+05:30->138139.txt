PUNE: The   ( ) came in for severe flak from the   (NGT) bench here on Friday over   it’s order seeking criminal prosecution in cases of illegal tree felling recorded since 2014.

 The bench of Justice U D Salvi and Ranjan Chatterjee directed the PMC to furnish details of an end-to-end mechanism the latter claims to have in place for handling complaints of illegal tree felling.
 
 The tribunal has also sought details of action taken in each of the 572 cases of illegal tree felling recorded since April 29, 2014. A total of 3,514 trees were illegally cut in these cases. PMC mentioned these numbers in an RTI response to activist Vinod Jain on October 4, 2016. It then claimed that 117 cases were referred to the courts for criminal prosecution.
 
 On Friday, the tribunal wondered why the remaining 455 cases were not referred to courts despite specific orders. “The matter has been posted for next hearing on February 14 when PMC will have to submit all this information to the tribunal,” Jain told TOI.
 
 At the last hearing on January 20, the tribunal had directed a show cause notice against PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar as to why coercive action should not be taken for non-compliance of its order on November 20, 2014 that sought criminal prosecution in illegal tree felling cases. 
 
 In his plea filed with the tribunal, Jain complained that the PMC was not following an agreement it had made with him in a previous proceeding, to follow the Bombay high court’s directions seeking strict adherence to the provisions under the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. Nor was it following the tribunal’s direction. He contested the PMC’s claim that it is effectively monitoring tree felling activity through the Tree Authority.
