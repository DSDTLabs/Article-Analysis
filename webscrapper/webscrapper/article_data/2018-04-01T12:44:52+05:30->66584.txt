Like a  , his mornings begin with prayers—hands joined and head bowed—in a small temple in his own house. On the wall opposite him is a portrait of the deity he worships.

 Unlike others, 30-year-old   has seen his God. That is because his God exists in flesh and blood. The portrait on the wall is that of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. A worshipper of the   since 2007, Thakur has even composed a   that he sings to his photo everyday. His evenings also end with prayers in his temple.
 
 
 A resident of village   in Sadar Tehsil of Gonda district, Thakur had met Yogi in January 2007 at Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur for the first time. He was so inspired and impressed by the temple mahant that he started worshipping Yogi like God and built a Yogi temple in his house.
 
 Thakur has never met Yogi again but his reverence for the chief minister has only deepened. Thakur, a graduate from a local college in Gonda, is unemployed. However, he says he is going to start a business in which he can employ others.
 
 
 “Maharaj ji (Yogi) is not communal as he is made out to be. During his long tenure as MP, he has addressed a large number of problems of the Muslim community. As chief minister, Maharaj ji is impartial and is taking care of the Muslim community,” says Thakur.
 
 
 Discussing his plans for entrepreneurship, Thakur says, “I am going to start a detergent powder manufacturing unit. I will give one rupee on the sale of each detergent packet for the Swachh Bharat Mission.”
 
 
 “I wish to meet Maharaj ji again some day. If ever I meet him, it will be like meeting ‘bhagwaan’. I have attended Maharaj Ji’s political rallies but did not get a chance to meet him personally,” says Thakur, as he gets up to prepare for his evening puja.
