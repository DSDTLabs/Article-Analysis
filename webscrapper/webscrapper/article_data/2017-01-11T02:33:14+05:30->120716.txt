NEW DELHI: The ten seats vacated by the defection of   faction to   were supposed to be a boon for second-line   workers in   but are now at the heart of an unseemly standoff. In what is an irony of massive proportions, the dominant faction of state Congress wants to bring in leaders from BJP to replace the Congressmen who have joined the saffron party.

 Most of the BJP leaders being imported lost to Congress in 2012 elections and will be denied ticket this time as BJP has to adjust the Congress imports. Ten Congress MLAs joined BJP after the coup they led against CM   in March 2016 came unstuck.
 
 The move is being resisted by organisational managers who feel the space created by defection should be used to blood the second-line of Congress aspirants. Congressmen apprehend if BJP turncoats are foisted on the party cadre, there would be unrest across seats and a spurt in rebel candidates.
 
 Insiders said the deadlock has reached the party leadership for adjudication. The contentious seats comprise Raipur, Roorkee, Khanpur, Rudraprayag, Kedarnath, Narendra Nagar, Jaspur, Sitarganj, Someshwar and Ram Nagar. According to sources, CM Rawat is backing a former BJP legislator, Suresh Jain, from Roorkee. He is being pushed in place of Pradeep Batra who joined BJP. The buzz is that for Rudraprayag, a Congress section is rooting for BJPâ€™s Bharat Chaudhary. The seat was vacated by former Congress minister Harak Rawat.
 
 Adesh Chauhan who switched sides from BJP to Congress is a potential candidate for Jaspur, vacated by rebel MLA Shailendra Singhal. In Narendra Nagar, the dominant Congress faction is backing saffron turncoat Om Gopal Rawat against Subodh Uniyal who followed Bahuguna to BJP.
