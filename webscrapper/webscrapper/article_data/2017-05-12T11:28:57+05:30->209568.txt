MUMBAI: A  , grievously injuring the driver,   (35), on 13th Road in  . His condition is critical, said the police. 

 Local corporator Alka Kerkar said as   is on along the stretch, it is likely that the soil around the tree might have loosened, weakening its roots and it got uprooted. “During such works, it is important that the soil be placed around trees to strengthen the roots again,” she added. 
 
 An official from the civic gardens department said, “We will look into the matter.” Traffic was affected on the road for hours as civic workers and police cleared the fallen tree.
 
 Ruing the incident, activist Anandini Thakoor alleged, “Some of the residents are to be blamed for not allowing BMC to do their work smoothly, by objecti-ng to cutting of trees, which is essential for infrastructure work.” 
 
 Last October, activist Zoru Bathena had filed an application in the Bombay high court seeking directions to stop the BMC from cutting 34 trees on 13th Road to widen the road. The HC had then directed the BMC to hear objections from citizens and activists by November 3, 2016. Dismissing allegations of interfering in the BMC work, Bathena said, “The BMC had voluntarily decided not to chop 21 of the 34 trees after hearing our objections. In fact, a few months ago, another tree had fallen on the same stretch. It appears that the BMC did not fill soil around trees during the road-widening work. Instead it used debris which weakened their roots.”
