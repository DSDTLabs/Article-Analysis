MUMBAI: When you spot an American wearing a peak cap, sitting along the lithe African runners, you wonder how much of a chance he has of breaking their stranglehold in marathon running.

  is no journeyman. Though he looks every bit like one.
 
 OK, he may not set Mumbai on fire with his running, but trust Jeffery to set a personal best. "The weather can be an equaliser. I feel pretty comfortable running in this humidity," says the Boulder, Colorado resident.
 
 Jeffrey's personal best is 2:10.52 at the  , where he finished second. But if you consider that he is a self-coached athlete, then the level of respect for him goes up several notches.
 
 "I consider it a success if I can finish ahead of what I am ranked in the race," says the 33-year-old.
 
 Jeffrey has achieved modest success, having won only the Lima marathon with a time of 2:15. But it has not stopped him from dreaming. "My grand uncle,  , a Belgian, was an Olympic Champion in the 1964 Games."
 
 To start with, Jeffrey was not even an athlete. He was a footballer, a midfielder. Then his true potential as a distance runner came to the fore. "I switched over to track and cross country, and after I graduated I became more serious about running and it became a profession."
 
 During races he says he thinks about his family. "Running is a very selfish sport. Most of the time you spend in training. I think about my family when I am running races."
