CHENNAI: Two women from Kilpauk have claimed that they were attacked by a gang of five men who robbed them of their gold chains at knifepoint on Thursday night. 

 
 The police said Mahalakshmi, 45, of   in  , was talking to her tenant Dharani, 40, on the first floor of her house at 9.15pm when the alleged incident happened.
 
 The women told police that they were engrossed in conversation when the gang came and one of the members brandished a knife. They then snatched two gold chains, each weighing three sovereigns, from the women. When Dharani tried to intervene, one of them attacked her with the knife slashing her hand. The women told police that the gang threatened to kill them if they raised an alarm.
 
 However, the   police, who were alerted through the control room, are trying to find out whether the complaint is true. "  camera footage collected from the scene of the crime did not show any gang of men in the area at the time mentioned by the victims," said an investigating officer. 
 
 "We are questioning the two women separately to get the sequence of events and identity of the gang members," the officer said.
 
 Police said although the neighbours called in the ambulance and sent Dharani to the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, no one noticed the movement of any gang in the locality.
