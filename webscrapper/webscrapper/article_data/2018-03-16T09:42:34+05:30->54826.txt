NEW DELHI: On March 16, 2012,   ended the long and tiring wait for his 100th international century at Dhaka's Shere Bangla National Stadium.

 
 
 Tendulkar, the leading run scorer in the history of both Test and ODI cricket, achieved the most-coveted ton by taking a single off Shakib Al Hasan against Bangladesh in  . Tendulkar's century came off 138 deliveries and was studded with 10 fours and a six.
 
 
 
 "I can't think of anything at this stage, it has been a tough phase for me," Tendulkar had said after reaching the milestone. "I started off the season well but was luckless. It does not matter how many hundreds you score, you still have to grind it out."
 
 "When I got the 99th century, no one spoke about it. I guess it was the media which started it. Everywhere I went people were talking about my 100th hundred," he said.
 
 
 
 
 
 He was finally out for 114, caught behind off Mashrafe Mortaza. However, India went on to lose the match by five wickets, as Bangladesh chased down Indiaâ€™s total of 289 with four deliveries to spare. 
 
 His 99th century had come against South Africa on March 12, 2011, at Nagpur during the World Cup and was left stranded on 99 international hundreds for a year and four days. In between he played Test series against England, West Indies and Australia. He also featured in a tri-series in Australia but his bid to become the first batsman to score 100 international hundreds remained unfulfilled, although he came close on a few occasions.
 
 In February 2010, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score a double hundred in one-day internationals, while in December 2010 he became the first to score 50 Test tons, both landmarks achieved against South Africa.
