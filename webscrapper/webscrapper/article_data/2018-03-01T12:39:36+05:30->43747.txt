INDORE: In yet another health horror from MP’s hinterland, the parents of a four-year-old girl in Ratlam were forced to carry her for 30km on a bike — with an IV attached — because there was no ambulance available. The child died.

 Little Jeeja of Nandleta village in Sailana was suffering from pneumonia and her parents Ghanshyam Nath and Jeenabai took her to a healthcare centre around 3pm on Monday. Despite initial treatment, her condition kept deteriorating, and the doctors referred her to Bal Chikitsalay in Ratlam.
 
  
  
 
 Ghanshyam requested the hospital for an ambulance but was told that it was unavailable. Rather than waste time looking for a car, the parents called their friend Prabhunath to come with his bike.
 
 While Ghanshyam held the sinking child to his chest and sat in the middle, Jeenabai held the IV bottle aloft, desperately holding on to it and herself as the bike bumped down village roads.
 
 The agony of the child who had a needle stuck in her arm during this tortuous ride is unimaginable.
 
 The trio arrived at the Ratlam hospital, and took the child inside but she was declared dead within minutes. “Treatment was started immediately, but the girl could not be saved,” Dr R C Damor told mediapersons.
 
 The parents and their friend broke down, clutching the child’s body.
 
 Ratlam collector in-charge Somesh Mishra has ordered an inquiry. “I have asked the resident medical officer to see if there was any lapse in treatment and if the child could have been saved if she received treatment on time. The SDM will see whether an ambulance was available or the family was denied,” said Mishra, adding that action will be taken if anyone is found guilty.
