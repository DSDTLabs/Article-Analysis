CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday suspended the four-year sentence awarded to former chief parliamentary secretary (CPS)   in the case of abetment to suicide of a journalist. Justice Inderjit Singh of the HC passed these orders while hearing Gujjar’s plea for suspension of sentence till the hearing of his appeal against the conviction.

 HC also clarified that the accused has to pay only Rs 3 lakh to the family and payment of remaining Rs 2 lakh would be stayed till further orders.
 
 On March 2, a trial court in Ambala had sentenced the Congress leader to four years’ jail. The court had also ordered Gujjar to pay Rs 5 lakh compensation to the victim’s family.
 
 Victim Pankaj Khanna, a journalist of Naraingarh, had ended his life on June 10, 2009, and accused Gujjar and two others of forcing him to take the extreme step in his suicide note.
 
 Pankaj had stated in the note that Gujjar had a grudge against him as his family had parted ways with the Congress, ending an old association.
 
 “After some time, my maternal uncle joined   and other   supported his decision. This did not go do down well with Gujjar. The MLA harassed me several times in various ways. His accomplices had beaten me mercilessly,” he stated in the suicide note.
 
 Police had lodged an FIR against Gujjar and his two aides on a complaint by Pankaj’s father  . Police had given a clean chit to Gujjar after investigation. Pankaj’s family had moved the court of the additional sessions judge saying that Gujjar could not be given a clean chit as his name was in the suicide note.
 
 The court had upheld the contention and issued summons to Gujjar. The   had then moved the Punjab and Haryana high court but his appeal was dismissed. He faced the trial and was convicted.
