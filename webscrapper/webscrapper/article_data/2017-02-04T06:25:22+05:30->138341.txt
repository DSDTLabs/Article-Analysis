MUMBAI/PUNE: A day after class XII   received flak for saying that ‘ugliness and handicap’ are among the reasons why parents have to shell out a higher dowry, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education chairman Gangadhar Mhamane defended it.

 “I had a discussion with the board of studies and they felt that the chapter only tries to highlight some of the reasons why parents have to pay dowry. There are over 10-12 reasons mentioned in the chapter, not just ‘ugliness’ and ‘handicapped’. Besides, this is the ground reality in rural Maharashtra. Also, sociology teaches prevalent practices in Maharashtra that have been mentioned in the textbook,” he said. 
 
 A professor from a Pune college said, “We are reluctant to discuss this topic as students tend to ask questions and we don’t have a good enough explanation for such social problems.” 
 
 The textbooks for classes I to VIII are created by Balbharati and those for classes IX to XII are created by the MSBSHE. 
 
 Principals feel there is a need to revamp the textbook writing process. “The team should have more autonomy and must evolve their methods. The text should be more student-friendly and technology could be used to avoid errors,” said Father Francis Swamy, joint secretary,  , which governs several state board schools in Mumbai. “We must also update our books more regularly.” 
 
  Teachers also sought more transparency in the selection process for the board of studies and other academic committees. 
 
 As most books are written in Marathi and then translated into other languages, errors crop up. “There needs to be standardization in case of terminology as subject experts might not be language experts, hence there could be mistakes,” said Vilas Parab, a teacher. The sociology textbook was written in Marathi and then translated into English.
