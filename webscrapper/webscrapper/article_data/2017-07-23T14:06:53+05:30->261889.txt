The MGR birth centenary celebrations held at Karaipudur near Palladam in Tirupur on Sunday saw assembly deputy speaker Pollachi V   and urban development and housing minister   locking horns over seating arrangements. Pollachi Jayaraman was given seat in the rear row of the stage, but he attempted to sit next to assembly speaker Dhanabal in the front row. This provoked Radhakrishann and he entered into a heated argument with Jayaraman. Health minister Vijayabaskar tried to pacify the duo, but in vain. As the war of words continued unabated for a while, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami intervened and pacified them. Radhakrishnan was then seated next to the CM and Jayaraman next to minister S P Velumani. Jayaraman walked out of the function as the CM started to distribute welfare schemes to the beneficiaries.
