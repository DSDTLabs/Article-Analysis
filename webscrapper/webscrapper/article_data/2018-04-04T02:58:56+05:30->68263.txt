NEW DELHI: The CAG report has brought to fore the failure of the Delhi SC/ST/OBC/Minorities and Handicapped Financial and Development Corporation Limited to deliver on its mandate to financially empower the   through loans, training and livelihood facilities. 

 Referring to the findings that the corporation has spent Rs 98.66 lakh on purchase and maintenance of staff vehicles, the CAG report for 2016-17 emphasises that the expenditure was “unacceptable” as there was a fleet of 10 cars while the requirement was for just two. 
 
 The corporation has also failed to recover Rs 8.27 crore outstanding under various loan schemes. On the other hand, the data show that only 24 disabled people were given loans under various schemes between 2012 and 2017 against a target of 696. “Against the disabled population of 2.35 lakh, the corporation could disburse loans to only 887 beneficiaries between 2003 and 17.”
 
 It also points out how 459 SC beneficiaries were given loans during 2012-17 against a target of 3,175. For backward classes, the number was 78 in 2012- 17 against a target of 2,020. Only 59 minority community beneficiaries got loans in 2012-17.
 
 The corporation neither conducted any survey for identification of targeted groups nor maintained any database of intended beneficiaries. Moreover, it has not been finalising its financial statements on a regular basis. The statements have not been audited since 2004-05.
 
 The audit notes there was a significant population of target groups who could be brought under various credit schemes. “There were sufficient funds from the apex corporations... but the corporation showed no urgency.” 
 
 Instead of finding eligible beneficiaries to disburse the concessional loans, it placed the surplus funds in banks and earned interest, the report notes. It earned Rs 35.53 crore as interest, constituting 91% of its total income, it adds.
