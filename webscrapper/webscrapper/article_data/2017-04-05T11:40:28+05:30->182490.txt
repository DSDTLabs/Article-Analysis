THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Five   of  , which aired a  , were arrested on Wednesday. 

 The   probing the controversy arrested the regional news channel's chief executive officer R Ajith Kumar, chief of investigative reports K Jayachandran alias S Narayanan, coordinating editor M B Santhosh, and news editors Firoz Sali Mohammed and S V Pradeep. 
 
 Their arrests were recorded after a marathon 13-hour interrogation--which began at 9am-found that the five were directly involved in telecasting the sleaze tape, which cost Saseendran his berth in the cabinet.
 
 Mangalam aired the tape as part of its launch-day programme on March 26.
 
 The arrested men have been housed at the crime branch headquarters, and would be produced before a court in Vanchiyoor here on Wednesday.
 
 The remaining accused, chairman of the channel Sajan Varghese, coordinating editor Rishi K Manoj and news editor Lakshmi Mohan, have been asked to appear before the SIT on Wednesday. They were let off on Wednesday after questioning.
 
 The woman involved in the erotic telephonic conversation, however, did not appear before the probe team on Tuesday. 
 
 Meanwhile, Ajith Kumar filed a petition before the Museum police on Monday saying his mobile phone and laptop had gone missing.
 
 The police were viewing Kumar's registration of a first information report as a ploy to evade charges under Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
 
 The "missing" laptop and mobile phone would be electronic evidence in the case, a police officer said. IPC Section 201 pertains to the punishment for causing any evidence to disappear.
 
 "If the complaint is proved false, the FIR itself will end up as an evidence for the destruction of evidence," police sources said.
