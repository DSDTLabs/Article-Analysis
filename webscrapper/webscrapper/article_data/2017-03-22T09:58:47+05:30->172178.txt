HYDERABAD: After information technology (IT) minister   on Tuesday morning tweeted requesting DGP Anurag Sharma to take action over a cop's alleged high-handed behaviour with a   at Nagole, Rachakonda police have started an inquiry on the same.

 On Tuesday morning, the minister tweeted and tagged DGP Anurag Sharma saying, “@TelanganaDGP garu, request you to take corrective action. Counselling for junior officers who have direct interface with people is essential.“ He also attached a photograph of a traffic cop pushing away watermelons from a street vendor's cart at Nagole.
 
 Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat asked additional DCP (traffic) N Divyacharan Rao to conduct an inquiry into the incident. During the probe, the police official was identified as Uppal traffic inspector E Jangaiah. He was issued a show cause notice. Inspector Jangaiah explained that the incident had happened on March 15 morning at Nagole when chief minister K Chandrasekar Rao's convoy was about to pass through the stretch. On March 15, the CM and his AP counterpart, N Chandrababu Naidu, went to   at Nagole to attend the wedding of TDP leader Mothkupally Narsimhulu's daughter.
 
 “When KCR's convoy was returning from the convention centre, I was clearing the route and told fruit vendors at Nagole bridge to move back. While two vendors followed my directions, the third fruit vendor, who had a static cart, did not move. While advance piloting the convoy, I saw the fruit vendor still on the road and went there to ensure that he moves back. I picked up a fruit, but did not cause any damage,“ the inspector said in his defence to senior officials. Police also examined the three fruit vendors Rajesh of Delhi, Raj Kumar of   and Rashid of Asad Baba Nagar. Rajesh and Raj Kumar moved away when the inspector asked them. “We are yet to record Rashid's statement. Once it is done, the report will be submitted to the Rachakonda commissioner,“ the additional DCP said.
