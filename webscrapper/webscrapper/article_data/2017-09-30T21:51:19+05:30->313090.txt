Meerut: In the backdrop of Muharram processions that will be taken out on Sunday, district administration has announced massive route diversions to ensure that no untoward incident happens.   According to SP, traffic, Sanjeev Bajpai, the route diversion will remain in effect from 11 a.m. till midnight. The route that will be most affected is the main arterial road of the city — Delhi Road (NH-58) that will remain inaccessible for heavy traffic as most of the processions will spill on this particular road.    Consequently, the buses coming from Delhi or Baghpat will not be able to enter the city but will take a circuitous route from Meerut Bypass Road to enter Kankerkhera and via cantonment, reach Meerut bus stand.    The same will be applicable for those buses coming from Muzaffarnagar and Bijnor. Trucks and other heavy vehicles that need to go to Moradabad or take NH 24 will have to use University Road route to reach Garh Road.    According to Bajpai, “The route diversion is applicable only on heavy vehicles but if the Moharram processions are big and involve larger crowds, even smaller four wheelers may be diversted but the decision will be taken only after analyzing the current situation and not before.”    Every year huge processions comprising tableaus and tazias are taken out during Moharram processions.
