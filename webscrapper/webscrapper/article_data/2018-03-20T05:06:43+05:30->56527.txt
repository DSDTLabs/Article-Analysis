MUMBAI: More than 1,500 able-bodied commuters were booked by the   (GRP) in a week-long drive against illegal travel in the   coach. This was the first time that the   lodged cases under the stringent Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act as a part of a dedicated drive. If found guilty under the law, offenders face a punishment of up to two years in prison or up to Rs 1 lakh in fine. 

 The drive was conducted from March 12 to 17. “Over 700 commuters were booked under the RPWD Act and sent to court,” an officer said. 
 
 The rest of the errant passengers escaped with comparatively lighter charges under the Indian Railway Act and the Maharashtra Police Act for want of a written complaint from   travellers. 
 
 As part of the drive, each GRP outpost was asked to form teams and send them out to surveil disabled coaches. “Those booked included personnel from the Mumbai police force, civic staffers and other government servants. We did not let off anyone lightly irrespective of what job he did or the position he held. Towards the end of the campaign, able-bodied commuters started staying away from the handicapped coach for fear of being booked,” an official said.
 
 Nitin Gaikwad, president of Prahar disabled railway passengers’ association, said installing surveillance cameras inside handicapped coaches was a must but the   had been shying away from it. “There is no significant publicity campaign undertaken by Western Railways asking able-bodied commuters to desist from entering the disabled coach,” he said, adding that that the RPF and ticket-checkers should operate jointly as only ticket-checkers have the powers to ask commuters to produce tickets and certificates of disability. 
 
 “It is very tough to board disabled coaches of Up locals from Kalyan, Dombivli and Thane stations during morning peak hours,” Gaikwad said. “A similar problem is faced while getting into Down locals from Thane and Dadar railway stations during evening peak hour.”
