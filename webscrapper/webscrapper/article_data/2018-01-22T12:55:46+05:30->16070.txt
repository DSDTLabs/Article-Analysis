 veteran   helped filmmaker   find an exorcist to rid his home of a ghost. "When I worked on 'A.I. Artifical Intelligence', I went and recorded the voice of the fairy at his place in  . All we did was talk about how his house was haunted and did I know a ghostbuster. And, of course, I do. So I sent him an exorcist," Streep told.

  
  
 Reportedly, Streep's ghost-removing expert was able to help the director. "Everything is clear down there now," she added. Her latest movie titled 'The Post' is her first time in front of the camera for Spielberg and the Oscar-winning   said she was 'completely unprepared' for his approach to filmmaking, including a lack of rehearsal process.
 
 "In my mind, he had a settled grandeur - a filmmaker who was so important, had this incredible CV and always talks about this well-oiled machine. So I was completely unprepared for how improvisatory his work is, how it is created in the moment.
 
 "Someone was going like this (tapping) with a pencil. We'd done one take and he decided, 'That's going to be the percussive energy of the scene. Everything is going to rev to that.' I thought, 'How?' And the whole thing changed. It was exciting to work with him," Streep said.
