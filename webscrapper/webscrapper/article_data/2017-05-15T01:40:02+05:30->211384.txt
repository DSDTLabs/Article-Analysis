NAVI MUMBAI: The   had asked citizens living in ‘dangerous buildings’ to vacate before the monsoon kicks in.

  The   have been served with a public notice to either vacate or repair the dilapidated buildings. 
 
 PCMC has also asked Cidco to inform the residents as a major part of the newly formed civic body is still handled by the town planning authority which also has data on the number of buildings. 
 
 PCMC engineer S B Katekar said, “The civic body in a public notice have asked the residents to vacate their   buildings ahead of the monsoon. They have been asked to repair their houses too.”
 
 As per PCMC data, 37 buildings or houses were dangerous. “Most of them have either been vacated or redeveloped. However, the remaining number of buildings have to be checked,”Katekar added.
 
 Cidco possibly has the count of buildings that fall in the dangerous category, the engineer said. 
 
 “PCMC has issued notices and given advertisements in local newspapers without doing a structural audit. They have not even prepared a technical report for issuing these notices,” a city resident, R Ingole, said.
 
 Some of the old buildings include the abandoned sub-divisional office in Line Ali area of Panvel. A few other buildings are located near Swami Nityanand Marg, Panvel. 
 
 “Many children play in the open area of the sub divisional office. This building had also housed many offices,” a Panvel resident,  , said. 
 
 In the absence of Cidco records, PCMC cannot declare buildings in Cidco nodes as dangerous. Further, the grampanchayats do not keep record of such buildings or houses that are dilapidated and dangerous.
