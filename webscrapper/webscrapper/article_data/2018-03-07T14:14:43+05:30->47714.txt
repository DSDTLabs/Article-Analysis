CHENNAI: In light of the increasing incidence of wild animals suffering injuries in human habitations, the Chennai office of the  , forests and climate change has decided to organise a training programme for veterinarians, particularly in the rural areas, on providing basic treatment to injured animals.

 In the first session, which began on Monday, 10 veterinarians each from  , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and two from   and Nicobar islands will learn from   experts on handling injured wildlife, particularly snakes. During the five-day session, they will be taken to the snake park in Guindy and the Vandalur zoo to see the typesof treatment provided, said regional head and additional principal chief conservator of forests M R G  .
 
 Most incidents of animals being injured occur near or within wildlife sanctuaries and in a majority of the cases, the injured animal invariably dies due to lack of proper veterinary care, said Reddy. 
 
 The role of veterinarians is crucial in such a situation as a trained professional can tranquilise the animal and release it in a nearby forest.
 
 While the first batch of training will be conducted by the Union ministry, the states concerned will be resposible for conducting at least three sessions that are required. The Tamil Nadu forest department is already preparing for the second session. Each state should have at least 100 vets to save injured wildlife and help bring down the incidence of man-animal conflicts, he said.
 
 The veterinarians will among other things learn about performing autopsies on animals, sampling in emergencies, rescue of wildlife during natural/man-made disasters, wild animal behavioural interpretation and distress management, therapeutic management of critically injured wildlife and disease-related issues.
