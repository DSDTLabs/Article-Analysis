Ludhiana: The pressure to score more marks and the desire to come up to the expectations of parents is driving an increasing number of children towards depression. So much that some of them are even drawn towards suicidal tendencies when they fail. Recently, a class X student committed suicide in the city, as she could not achieve a good rank in the examination.

 The psychiatrists largely blame parents behind raising the pressure among children, as in many of the cases, the children have been found taking the extreme step after feeling they had let down their parents. What is worse is that nuclear families and working parents — who are unable to lend emotional support to children when they need encouragement and support to overcome depression — seem to be adding to their woes.
 
 “Parents are largely to be blamed for the increasing tendency among students to end their lives or leave home, as in many cases, instead of encouraging them, they start nagging the children if they fail to get the expected marks,” said Dr Ajaypal Sandhu, a psychiatrist from a leading private hospital. He also adds that due to the absence of grandparents in most families, children hardly get any emotional support. “Moreover, comparison with other children is the worst thing parents do to their own kids, because it not only makes them feel small, but also creates a sense of inferiority and induces depression among them,” he said. 
 
 He mentioned that his hospital received at least 10 children — a week after the announcement of results — with major complaints of depression, after they could not score good marks. While advising the parents, Dr Sandhu said instead of cribbing, the parents should tell their child that failure is not the end of life, and give examples of those people who became popular and successful in life, despite having failed many times.
 
 Echoing similar sentiments, head of psychiatry department at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Dr Mamta Singla, said: “Children these days suffer too much the burden of expectations from parents, as an increasing number of parents these days have a single child. The parents keep high expectations from him or her, which takes its toll on students at times. While counselling of students before and after exam results are a must, parents should also be made to attend these sessions so that they learn to deal with their children in such situations.”
 
 Another psychiatrist with a private hospital in Model Town, Dr Priyanka Kalra, said: “The educational system of this country is based more on a theoretical system rather than overall development of students. During exams days, sometimes students are in so much of stress that they do not write their exams well. It affects their results.” She advised parents to think about the overall development of their children, and try to think beyond marks. 
 
 Advisory for parents and children
 
 * Parents should not fix a percentage of marks their children should score in their exams.
 
 * Parents should not compare their child with other children.
 
 * Parents should create a secure environment at home, and build confidence among children that they can share anything with them. Children should feel that even if they get less marks, parents will always remain on their side.
 
 * Children should be made to understand that exam results are a milestone, and not the end of the world. There is always scope for improvement.
