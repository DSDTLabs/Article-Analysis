PUNE: Converting waste into   can tackle the burgeoning garbage problem the city has been facing, industrialist Adar   said on Monday, while mooting the idea of setting up a waste-to-power plant in Pune. 

 Poonawalla is in talks with several top civic officials and departments of the state government regarding the project, which will require about 20 acres of land. Critical meetings on the matter are expected in the weeks ahead.
 
 Stressing on the urgent need to find a better solution to waste disposal, Poonawalla said, “Garbage management is a global problem. Proposals like waste-to-electricity plant, or other such technologies are the need of the hour,” the industrialist said.
 
 Poonawalla is the owner and chief executive officer of  , which launched the environmentally sustainable   Clean City Initiative last year to make the city more livable by picking waste and garbage from nearly 40% of its areas.
 
 The initiative is mapped with the help of ‘myapcc’ — a cellphone application designed for citizens to report garbage in their areas and to track the resolution of the same. It is focusing on creating awareness amongst the student community (in schools and colleges) about the importance of waste segregation and its impact on the environment.
