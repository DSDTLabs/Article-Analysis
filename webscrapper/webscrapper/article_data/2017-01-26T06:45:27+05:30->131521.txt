NEW DELHI: The family of the Uber cabbie,  , who died after his vehicle was hit by a speeding BMW on Sunday night, is likely to return to Delhi after performing his last rites in  . 

 They are planning to meet the relatives of other road accident victims in order to form a group, which will in turn, push for a stronger Motor Vehicles Act and a compensation policy. 
 
 Islam’s wife Arjana Biwi claims she will spend all her savings in her fight for justice and will ensure that the accused driver is booked under harsher sections. She is trying to connect with other families, who too lost their near and dear ones, through a WhatsApp group.
 
 “I will return with whatever means I have to fight for my husband,” said Arjana. The family travelled to   in West Bengal with Islam’s remains to perform his last rites. 
 
 Arjana worked as a maid at an apartment in Gurgaon and earned Rs 2,000 monthly till the tragedy tragedy struck her. “I could not work much after the birth of our second child. My husband kept shifting jobs to earn enough to support the family. Now, I have to work very hard to manage the family,” she added.
 
 Islam’s nephew Mizanur plans to take a rented accommodation at a village in Delhi so that they can pursue the case. “Our earnings are meagre and I have to leave the house where I stay at present. I need to be present in every court hearing to ensure that the killer doesn’t get away with the crime,” Arjana said. 
 
 Mizanur said Arjana would leave her two children with her parents in Dinajpur before returning to Delhi within a few days. “I have sought help from the relatives of other victims. We have formed a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with each other. We have also added media professionals to the group,” said Mizanur.
 
 The family plans to meet senior police officers and government officials next week.
