Ahmedabad: After renouncing Hinduism over caste-based discrimination and injustice, the victims of the Una flogging incident will now begin a campaign to build a temple to Lord Buddha at Una, where they were flogged by gau rakshaks (cow protectors).

 Balu Sarvaiya, the father of Ramesh and Vashram Sarvaiya, who were beaten along with Bechar and Ashok Sarvaiya, in July 2016, said he will seek help from atrocity victims across Gujarat to collect bricks for the temple to commemorate the flogging incident, so people know about its history.
 
 Sarvaiya and 45-odd family members converted to Buddhism at a ceremony at Mota Samadhiyala village in Una taluka of Gir-Somnath district on Sunday.
 
 Sarvaiya said the construction of the Buddha temple may take time as they do not have significant capital and will need donations from community members.
 
 “We converted to Buddhism and renounced Hinduism as we were subjected to inhuman treatment in the Hindu religion, just because we belong to the Dalit community. We chose Buddhism as Babasaheb Ambedkar had also converted to Buddhism. Now, we will also propagate the Bauddha Dhamma (religion) in the community and for that we will begin a campaign to build a grand Buddha temple at Una, where we were brutalized by gau rakshaks and the self-proclaimed custodians of Hindutva,” said Sarvaiya.
 
 About how they will fund the building of the temple, Sarvaiya said, “I will seek help from community members in this noble work and we will start working on it from the next week.”
 
 Vashram, Ramesh, Ashok and Bechar Sarvaiya, were flogged and paraded half naked by ‘cow protectors’ on July 11, 2016. This incident shook the country and spawned a Dalit movement in Gujarat. Two years after the incident, the Sarvaiyas decided to convert to Buddhism.
