 When asked about micro and small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) facing hurdles to get loans due to non-performing assets (NPAs) of big companies, Mandaviya said that the current NDA government has given Rs four lakh crore to facilitate MSME start-ups. 
 
 Talking about Goods and Services Tax (GST), the minister said that the industries are now adjusting well with the new tax regime, which is going to be the biggest reform undertaken by the Centre. 
 
 “Whenever such big reform is done, some problems happen. Many other countries that adopted GST faced much more problems than us. But now the industries are settling in with GST. Many of them are happy now. Our GST council meets regularly to sort out any issue faced by the industries,” Mandaviya said.
