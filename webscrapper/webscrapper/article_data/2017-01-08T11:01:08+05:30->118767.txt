GUNTUR: With films of   and Balakrishna slated for a Sankranti release, tempers seem to be rising with each passing day. Worried that fans of both the big stars will indulge in street brawls and spill blood, DGP Sambasiva Rao on Saturday warned that serious action would be taken against those resorting to hate-mongering, especially on social media. 

 Speaking at a programme here, the DGP said the fans should stay away from controversies and stick to watching films of their heroes. "If the fans resort to hate-mongering by talking ill of other actor, his fans or raise caste bogey or resort to fights on the streets, we will not spare them," he warned. He further said that if anybody tried to instigate violence by damaging hoardings and banners, it would attract stringent action. 
 
 The police department will beef up security at all theatres during the Sankranti season. "A film should be watched and should not be used as an occasion to create unnecessary ruckus," he added. 
 
 Chiranjeevi's film Khaidi No 150 is due for release on January 11 and the film of TDP MLA and  's brother-in-law Balakrishna, Gautamiputra Satakarni, a day later. 
 
 Veteran director Dasari Narayana Rao, whodid not see eye to eye with Chiranjeevi for a long time, sprang a surpise at the pre-release function of Chiru's film at Mangalagiri by singing paens to the star. "He became a Megastar due to hard work and dedication and stands as a shining example for many youngsters. Every hero still apes his dancing steps. He commands supreme support from people of the state," Dasari said.
