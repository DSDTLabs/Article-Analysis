CHENNAI: Within 24 hours of introducing a 2% levy, PayTM on Friday withdrew the charge on credit card usage, saying that it was keeping “users’ convenience in mind.” The e-wallet also said it is building a set of new features to curb such misuse.

 PayTM had introduced the charge on Thursday, after it had blocked credit cards of users, suspected of exploiting the discounts. Last November, PayTM had launched a new payment platform for small merchants at 0% fee. “But we soon realised that there were merchants and bank staff misusing our 0% bank fee offer to fund their wallet with credit cards and then transfer the money to their bank accounts — in effect getting loyalty points or cash and free credit,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO, PayTM in an earlier interview to TOI. Explaining the reversal of policy within a day, the CEO tweeted, “We didn’t charge, your bank did. No more fee for using credit cards to add money.” The PPI (pre-paid instruments) said it had applied a refundable fee of 2% with the intent of preventing misuse of the 0% bank facility. “At the same time, we are conscious that this move caused inconvenience to a large segment of our users, including those who are using their credit card for genuine transactions,” said PayTM on its blog.
 
 “ Keeping the millions of customers and merchants interest as utmost priority, we have decided to suspend the 2% fees and will continue to build a series of features to curb such misuse,” said the company. PayTM reassured its customers that if their account had been inadvertently blocked, the move would be reversed.
