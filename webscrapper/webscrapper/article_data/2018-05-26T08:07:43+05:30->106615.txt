KOLKATA: Monsoon may arrive in Kolkata and south   sooner than normal. On Friday, south-west monsoon currents reached Nicobar Islands, raising hopes of an early arrival of the rains in Kerala and Bengal. Kolkata and south Bengal could be lashed by monsoon rains by June 8, said weathermen.

 
 South-west monsoon hit Nicobar Islands and will cover the entire Andaman and Nicobar region in the next three days. It is due to hit Kerala on May 29, but could reach the state even before that. “If it does, then Bengal and Kolkata should be hit by the monsoon within the next eight days. But there are factors that could still delay the onset of monsoon in the region. So far, they haven’t come into play so we expect the rains to arrive in Bengal at the usual time,” said a Met official. Last year, monsoon struck Kolkata on June 12.
 
 
  
 
 A statement issued by the   ( ) on Friday declared the onset of southwest monsoon over   and Nicobar Islands. Some parts of south Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and Andaman & Nicobar Islands could be hit within the next 48 hours, it said.
 
 Kerala is due to receive monsoon on May 29. But the progress of the monsoon currents so far strongly indicate that rains could lash the state earlier than expected. Monsoon currents are exceptionally strong this year, experts said. “It could reach Kerala in the next two days. The monsoon flow is very strong this time. It normally takes about eight days for the currents to hit south Bengal once it has lashed Kerala,” explained a Met official.
 
 The three major factors that influence the progress of monsoon currents are cross-equitorial flow of wind, low-pressure situation and the heat condition in north-west India. “If this conditions remain favourable, like they are at the moment, the currents should advance fast. But often, they get altered stalling the flow, which delays the onset in eastern and northern parts of the country,” said the official.
