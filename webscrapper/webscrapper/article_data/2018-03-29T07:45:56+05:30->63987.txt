PATNA: An associate professor at   (AIIMS-P), Sushmita Das, has challenged before the Patna bench of   (CAT) the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s letter to the institute’s director on February 26 this year for terminating her along with 18 other teachers from service for alleged violation of norms in their appointments.

 The AIIMS-P director, on the ministry’s letter, had served show-cause notices on the 19 professors on March 9. One of the aggrieved teachers, Dr  , had challenged the show-cause notices on March 20 and the CAT sought AIIMS-P reply. The next date of hearing in that case is April 6.
 
 Das was appointed as assistant professor in the microbiology department of AIIMS-P. In her petition filed in the CAT on Wednesday, Das submitted that her appointment as assistant professor was cleared by the CAT’s principal bench in New Delhi in 2016, but the Union ministry decided this year to terminate her over the same issue.
 
 Advocate Vinay Kumar Pandey defended the ministry’s letter and show-cause notices and told the tribunal the AIIMS-P matter was different as the the principal bench of CAT order was related to AIIMS-Rishikesh only and it was not applicable in Das’s case. “Das’s case will come up for hearing again on April 24,” he said, adding no order was passed in connection with the ministry’s letter.
 
 The show-cause notices were served on the basis of a report by the Vikash Arya inquiry committee, which was set up by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in 2012 to probe into the anomalies in the AIIMS-P teachers’ appointment. The committee had found the teachers ineligible for appointment and submitted its report in 2014. The Patna bench (CAT) of judicial member J Bhairava and administrative member Justice   of the Patna high court, while staying the show-cause notices, sought a reply from AIIMS-P in two weeks as why the notices had been served four years after the submission of inquiry report and should not be quashed.
