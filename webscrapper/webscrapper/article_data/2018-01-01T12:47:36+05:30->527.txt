It’s time for new beginnings, new opportunities, new relationships and for many, a new outlook on life. On this, the first day of the year, Pune Times spoke to people from across the city, who shared their   wishlist for Pune, with us. With best wishes for 2018 from Team PT, here are a few of the wishes that Punekars have for their city, for the year ahead.

 The city has many heritage spots and culturally rich places. The PMC should develop selfie points at these places, that will attract both locals as well as tourists. - —
