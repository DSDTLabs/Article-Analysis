The second video song from Nivin Pauly’s Sakhavu titled Udhichuyarnne was out recently, and it has an optimistic undertone to it. The song is predominantly about a communist’s life, and   is seen recalling the bygone days of their life, when it was not just strikes, but their days were filled with frolic, dance and music as well. 

 The song sung by Sithara Krishnakumar and Vaikom Vijayalakshmi is composed by Prashanth Pillai, the lines of which have been penned by Santhosh Varma. Just as the word ‘Udhichuyarnne’ implies, the song is symbolic of the heights they have scaled with the passage of time. 
 
  Udhichuyarnne features actor   and Aishwarya Rajesh, along with the group of other comrades.
