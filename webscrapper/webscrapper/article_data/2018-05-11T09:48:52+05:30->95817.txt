NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket of India ( ) has sought clarification from video analyst of the Indian team CKM   on a possible conflict of interest.

 
 
 The Committee of Administrators ( ) has made it clear that those employed with the Indian support staff team can’t take outside jobs like coaching an   team or doing commentary in IPL. There were complaints that Dhananjai was also working for the   team, sources told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Sources said Dhananjai wrote back to BCCI and explained he was only following the Mumbai Indians to watch their games and was not working as a video analyst for them. BCCI, which had acted on a tip-off from an internal source, was more or less satisfied with Dhananjai’s reply. “There can’t be smoke without fire. There must be something that wasn’t right. Dhananjai has explained his position and the matter is closed, but BCCI would keep a track of any such incident for sure,” a top board official said.
 
 Among the Indian team’s support staff, chief coach Ravi Shastri isn’t allowed to do commentary. Similarly, the staff members like assistant coach Sanjay Bangar, bowling coach Bharat Arun and fielding coach R Sridhar are not allowed to take up any other assignment. This has been done to ensure Indian coaches are not in a position to influence team selection.
