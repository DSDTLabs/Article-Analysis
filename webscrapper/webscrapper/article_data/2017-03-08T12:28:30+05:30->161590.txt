Udupi: Udupi district   on Monday inspected the Varahi irrigation canals to review its maintenance and attended a public grievance meet, where people in large numbers poured out their woes. He visited Nailady, Haladi, Yadady-Matyady, Molahalli, Hardalli-Mandalli, Jamadagni and Bharatkal in Kundapur.

 At the last KDP meeting on February 20, people from Halady and Kundapur complained of lack of maintenance of the Varahi irrigation project and leakages at diversion chambers. The minister gave officials a monthâ€™s time to sort out the issues related to the project. On Monday, when the minister arrived for a spot inspection, he found that very little had been done to mitigate the problems of the farmers. The minister instructed deputy commissioner   to probe why the farmers had not been compensated. The minister has also been asked to prepare a project progress report after a detailed review.
 
 Farmers demanded compensation, as their land had been acquired for the construction of the Varahi Left Bank Canal. Farmers were not getting benefit of the canal water, as there is no distributary channels at various places and they have not been allowed to install motors inside the canal. A few of the farmers demanded approach roads. Locals said that while the main canals have water throughout the year, in the sub canals water was released temporarily as the minister is visiting.
 
 Shankar Shetty, a farmer from Haladi, said that people cannot walk on the road during the monsoon as water from the distributary canal overflows onto the road. Shiva Shankar, a member of Raitha Sanga, alleged that they are yet to receive compensation for damages to their houses. At least 20 houses were damaged when there were blasts to build canals. Houses in Gudyangadi, Kakkuje and in Molahalli developed cracks and none of them got compensation, he said.
