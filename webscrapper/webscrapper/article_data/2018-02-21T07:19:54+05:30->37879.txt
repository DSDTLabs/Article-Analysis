 and Russia's state-controlled   Group have hit a fresh snag in their pursuit of  , an insolvent producer that could fetch at least $6 billion.

 Advisers evaluating the offers for   are recommending that all the bids be disqualified, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A committee of Essar Steel lenders will meet later this week to discuss the eligibility of the proposals, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
 
 Legal and accounting advisers expressed concerns to the interim resolution professional (IRP) overseeing the sale about the eligibility of the offers from both ArcelorMittal and the VTB consortium, the people said. The advisers' opinion is meant as a guide, and there's no certainty the bids will be blocked, according to the people. Any final decision will involve the lenders' committee and the NCLT, the people said.
 
 ArcelorMittal submitted a higher offer than the VTB investor group, which is backed by the son of a billionaire founder of Essar Steel, the people said. ArcelorMittal was considered ineligible to bid because it held a stake in Uttam Galva Steels, which is classified as a delinquent borrower, when it made its offer for Essar Steel, the people said.
 
 The VTB consortium submitted a bid through a Mauritius-based investment vehicle called Numetal. "We have not received any such information from the resolution professional or his legal advisers," a representative for Numetal said. A representative for Essar Steel declined to comment. An external spokesman for ArcelorMittal said the company doesn't believe there is any legal basis under which it would be considered ineligible to participate in the process.
