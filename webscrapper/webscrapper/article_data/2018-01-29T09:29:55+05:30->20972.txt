THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The kitchen of  , Thonnakkal, which was shut down after the students were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of food poisoning will reopen on Monday. Assistant commissioner of food safety A K Mini has given permission to open the kitchen after nearly 450 children who depend on noon meal scheme were denied the service for a week.

 More than 144 student of the school, from   to Class IV, took treatment at SAT hospital following complaints of fever, stomach ache, vomiting and diarrhoea last week. The food safety officials detected presence of coliform bacteria in the water samples collected from the school tank and tap. They also found presence of mold in curd served to the students.
 
 Food safety officials have directed the school authorities to clean the water tank before resuming the noon meal programme and appointed a food safety officer to evaluate the improvement measures. 
 
 Food safety assistant commissioner Mini said the presence of bacteria in the tank might be due to lack of periodic cleaning. "We also directed the kitchen staff to purchase curd instead of making it," she said.
 
 SAT superintendent   said that they suspect food poisoning was due to the consumption of stale curd. "Since the incident was reported after a day, we could not collect the samples of leftover food," he said. 
 
 The food safety department has decided to conduct awareness classes regarding food safety norms in all schools which provide noon meal in the district. The district development committee will also conduct inspections of kitchen and toilets in schools in the district.
