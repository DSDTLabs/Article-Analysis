PUNE:   enrolment work in Pune district will be carried out at government buildings by Mahaonline, stated   while addressing the issue of delay of Aadhaar registration work in the district.

 The issue was raised by   (DPDC) members on Friday.
 
 With work of Aadhaar registrations being handed over to Mahaonline, Pune collector Saurabh Rao stated that the centres will operate from government offices as per the central UIDAI order. 
 
 “Within a week, we will transfer the machines with the existing agency to Mahaonline. The machines will have to be re-registered with the operators so that the work can commence. We will have these centres at various government offices so that it will enable those not having Aadhaar card to enrol themselves at these centres,” the collector said.
 
 He added that those having an issue with fingerprint impression or where the prints are not clear, iris scan should be considered in such cases and Aadhaar registration process should go ahead. 
 
 The district has so far completed enrolment for 91 per cent of the population. However, Aadhaar work has been stalled in the district because of the issue of delisting of agencies carrying out the enrolment process.
 
 MLA Medha Kulkarni raised the issue of complaints from people facing issues regarding fingerprint scan and differently-abled unable to register for Aadhaar. 
 
 However, with the collector assuring that only iris scan would be required in such cases, such persons could now enrol for Aadhaar.
