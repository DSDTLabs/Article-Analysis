KOLHAPUR: Owing to the   in the last fiscal, the   of   (MSRTC) has decided to discontinue its services along 12 routes.

 The bus services have been suspended on Chandgad- Mumbai, Chandgad-Borivili, Gadhinglaj- Mumbai, Aajra-Parel, Kolhapur- Borivili,  , Sambhajinagar-Borivili, Kurandwad-Nashik, Kagal-Jamkhendi(Karnataka), Kolhapur-Pune (shivneri), Kolhapur-Mumbai(shivneri ) and Aajra-Mumbai routes.
 
 There are 12 bus depots in Kolhapur division of MSRTC. The division has been incurring heavy losses due to the poor response from the passengers and a fierce competition from the private players and illegal passenger transporters. 
 
 Assistant superintendent of traffic department in Kolhapur division Atul More told TOI, “We have been facing a stiff competition from the illegal transporters and private bus operators across the district. The condition of our buses is also not go good and we are not even getting enough passengers as we use to get earlier.”
 
 “We are left with no option but to shut the service along these routes. Earlier these private buses were confined to a few routes but now, it is a big challenge for us to survive in the market,” he added.
 
 An MSRTC official said, “We need at least 60% seats to fill in each ferry to run on a no loss, no profit basis. But, not more than 40% seats were filled along these routes. The major factor for this decline is the low fare rates of the private operators. Since our tickets are fixed by the central office this year, we don’t have any right to alter it at the divisional level.”
