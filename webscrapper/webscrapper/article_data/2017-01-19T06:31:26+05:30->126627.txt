GANDHINAGAR: As part of its protests across India against the hardship caused to common people due to demonetization of high value notes by PM Narendra Modi’s Union government,   staged a protest outside the regional office of the   (RBI) in Ahmedabad. 

 Congress leaders and workers attempted to surround (gherao) and lock the RBI office. Many key leaders and some 300 workers were detained by police. Former Union home minister and senior Congress leader   joined the protests, besides senior Gujarat Congress leaders like state unit chief Bharatsinh Solanki,   and others.
 
  Solanki said: “Even 70 days later, against the PM’s promise of 50 days, normalcy has not returned to the country and the common man is still facing hardships in daily life. We decided to protest against the RBI because despite being an autonomous institution and having statutory powers, it is acting as a political tool of the Prime Minister and the BJP. Instead of easing people’s troubles, the RBI is busy facilitating the rich and BJP associates. BJP has used the RBI to waive non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks at the cost of the common people. Now, the PM does not utter a word about black money and is only talking of a cashless and ‘digital’ India.”
 
 Shinde said: “Since November 8, 150 persons have lost their lives and more than 40 lakh people have lost their jobs but there is no solution in sight from the government. The RBI has became a puppet of the PM, so we had to raise the people’s voice and remind the RBI of its duty.”
 
 Shankersinh Vaghela, leader of opposition and other leaders also cricitized the BJP-led Union and state governments at the protest site.
