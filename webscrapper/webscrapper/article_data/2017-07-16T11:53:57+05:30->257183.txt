KOCHI: The special investigation team (SIT) is trying to determine whether the main accused (Pulsar Suni) got any part of the 'promised money' in the actor rape case. Police, who questioned his relatives, examined their bank accounts to verify this matter.

 Sources said Suni's mother had told them about her basic source of income.“The woman claimed that she earned Rs 600 a day from manual labour apart from other source of income. She also claimed that the maximum money her son, Suni, had given her at a time was Rs 2,000. We are investigating whether any cash transfers were done to the family,“ said an officer.
 
 On Friday, police had searched  's   home to recover the phone and memory card that contained the visuals of the crime. But on Saturday, Dileep's lawyer claimed in court that the phone and memory card were already seized from the advocate's office. SIT said that the visuals of the crime were handed over to the advocate who subsequently handed it over to Dileep.
 
 Meanwhile, police have intensified the search for Dileep's aide Appunni, who has been untraceable for the past few days. SIT is set to arraign him as an accused in the case.
 
 SIT has found evidence of Appunni's presence in locations where the conspiracy was hatched between Suni and Dileep, said sources. Appunni alias   has been missing over the past two days.
 
 SIT is collecting statements from   personalities who were present at a hotel where Dileep and the survivor had a spat in 2013.
