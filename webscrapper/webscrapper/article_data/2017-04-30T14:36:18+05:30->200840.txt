AMRITSAR: Did the eternal God create the human mind or vice-versa? Are the religious scriptures divinely inspired or the creation of mankind? Are the destructive faculties of man’s mind turning him into a Frankensteinian monster? 

 The questions beg answers, which ‘Antarwandh…Enigma of mind’, a play staged at  , seeks to explore. 
 
 Staged on the occasion of the school’s Annual  , the presentation endorses the vast capabilities of the human mind in consonance with John Milton’s famous quote in  , “The mind is its own place, and in itself, can make a heaven of hell and hell of heaven.” 
 
 The seven sages in the introductory scene of the play too testify to the same. The budding thespians invoked their theatrical skills to explore the extensive potential of the human mind and the ‘ambition’ that it harbours, which, in the words of Alexander Pope, ‘can destroy or save, and make a patriot, as it makes a knave.’ 
 
 They advocated taming it by imbibing positive thoughts.The play also raises the equally serious issue of brain drain and its adverse impact on the Indian economy, the corruption prevailing in politics and the society, the naiveté of the masses, who are exploited and misled by the very leaders they elect and the need for heightened awareness and vigilance in every sphere of life to make the world a place habitable enough for one and all.
