Investigation officer   said, “All out efforts are being made to track down Sameer, as his arrest is crucial to getting to the root of the racket and the quantity fake notes they have circulated in the market.”
 
 A sleuth privy to the investigation said that though a second set of recovery has been made, it could be said that the case is still at a primary stage, as the investigation team still does not know how and when the idea to print fake currency notes came up.
