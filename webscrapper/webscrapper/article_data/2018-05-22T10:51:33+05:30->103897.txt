CHENNAI: When   resident   was conned into revealing the details of his credit card on which a cellphone was later purchased, he didn't get cross. The 57-year-old vegetable vendor decided to get even. He used the delivery of the cell bought on his card as bait to trap the conman before handing him over to the police. The cheat, Rajesh, finally got his cell, in jail! 

 
 On May 17, a police officer said, Hari Krishnan received a call from a man claiming to be the employee of   (SBI) whose credit card he had secured a few days ago from Rajesh, an agent. It was Rajesh who called Krishnan to share his card's three-digit CVV, promising to upgrade it, but spoke in a different tone and the vegetable vendor didn't find anything amiss, the officer said.
 
 A little later, Rajesh called and asked Krishnan for the one-time password ( ) sent to his mobile phone number. An unsuspecting Krishnan gave it and soon received a message on his phone, saying 8,499 had been spent on his credit card to buy a mobile phone through online portal Amazon. 
 
 Krishnan immediately called the number from which he received the call and found it was switched off. Realising he had been duped, he informed his family members and they decided to trap the man. He kept calling the number. On Sunday when a man, later revealed as Rajesh, finally answered, one of Krishnan's family members told him he was an employee of the courier firm that had been tasked with delivering the mobile phone he had ordered from Amazon.
 
 Saying that the staff could not deliver the parcel at his residential address as it contained a phone, the man asked Rajesh to come to the firm's office in Natarajapuram in Kancheepuram. When Rajesh arrived and presented the receipt he had received online and sought to collect the parcel, Krishnan and his family members pounced on him, thrashed him before handing over to the police. The Vishnu Kanchi police registered a case and arrested Rajesh.
