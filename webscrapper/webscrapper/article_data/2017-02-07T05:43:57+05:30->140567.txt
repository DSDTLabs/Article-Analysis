PATNA: The ongoing controversy over the reported leakage of answers of the   (BSSC)’s clerical grade examinations turned uglier on Monday with alleged All India Students’ Association (AISA) activists manhandling   Parmeshwar Ram at the commission’s office.

 The AISA activists, numbering not more than 100, were carrying party flags and raising slogans outside the commission’s office near the veterinary college against alleged malpractices in the clerical grade examinations held across the state on Sunday. They were also demanding cancellation of the examination.
 
 Several candidates were also there at the commission’s office apparently to inquire about their examinations for which they applied up to three years ago. Sources said altogether 18.5 lakh candidates have applied for the four examinations to be conducted by the BSSC. Only two of these examinations have been conducted so far.
 
 Eyewitnesses said BSSC secretary Ram along with a colleague was entering the office when the AISA youths mobbed them. Ram tried to pacify them and invited their delegation to his office for talks.
 
 Suddenly, however, the mob turned violent and started raining punches on the secretary. Before the policemen in a patrol vehicle nearby could rush to rescue Ram, he was thrashed. Later, he was taken to his chamber.
 
 ADM (law and order) Rajesh Chaudhary and DSP (secretariat)   reached the spot after the incident. Additional policemen were also deployed at the commission’s office.
 
 “An FIR has been lodged by the BSSC secretary. He has named six people and 30 to 40 unnamed people as accused,” Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said on Monday evening.
 
 Incidentally, a group of   activists also demonstrated against alleged malpractices in the BSSC exams. They also tried to barge into the office, albeit in vain.
