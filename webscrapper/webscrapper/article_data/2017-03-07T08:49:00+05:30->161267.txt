NEW DELHI: The   (NDMC) is planning to provide free Wi-Fi services at Lodhi Garden from next month. Later, the same facility will be expanded to other parks also.

 Senior NDMC officials said that work has been initiated and it will take a month to make Lodhi Garden a “free Wi-Fi zone“.
 
 “We are working on the project and tenders have been floated. Lodhi Garden is an important place for regular morning and evening walkers in  . It is important to connect the parks with facilities like free Wi-Fi where people can enjoy their leisure time,“ said a senior NDMC official.
 
 The Wi-Fi services will be provided atop `smart poles', which the council has been planning for the last two years but the project was stuck in a limbo. “Smart poles are LED streetlights equipped with Wi-Fi facility and security camera. The LED lights also save cost. Around 12,000 such poles will be erected across NDMC areas,“ added the official.
 
 He further said that in the first phase, Lodhi Garden will be covered and the same will be replicated to other parks, important monuments, Metro stations and market places under NDMC's jurisdiction.
 
 The plan to make NDMC areas free Wi-Fi zone was proposed in 2014 and several times tenders were floated, but no bidder took interest in the ambitious project.
 
 While presenting the budget for 2017-18, NDMC chair man Naresh Kumar announced that under the smart city project, the council is planning to form a SPV (specialpurpose entityvehicle) with a subsidiary of MTNL and extend Wi-Fi services in major markets like Connaught Place, Khan Market and  .
 
 “Initially, we had planned to provide free Wi-Fi services in high-end markets but no bidder was ready to take the project. So, NDMC has signed an agreement with MTNL and we will form a SPV with one of their subsidiaries. The SPV will be formed by April this year and immediately we will start working on free Wi-Fi project in high-end markets,“ said the official.
