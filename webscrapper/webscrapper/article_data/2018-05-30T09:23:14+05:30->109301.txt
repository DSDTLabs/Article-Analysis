CHENNAI: Having overcome the death of her father to ace the Class XII exams with 1176 marks, a corporation school student realised her dream by landing the first seat of the BCom   at   College on the opening day of the admission process on Tuesday.

 On May 17, TOI had reported that Pavitha Preethi, a student of the   Girls Higher Secondary School, Saidapet, emerged among the toppers despite the loss of her father in a road accident three months earlier and a financial crunch. On Tuesday, the chairman of Ethiraj College, VM Muralidharan, admitted her to the first seat for the BCom programme.
 
 “I called her up as soon as I read the news report. She wanted to study here and she deserved this for all her hard work,” said Muralidharan who told Pavitha to continue her brilliant performance. The   received over 3,500 applications for the 70 BCom seats, said staff from the department.
 
 Braving the odds, the IAS aspirant worked hard, supported by her sister Nikhitha. “She constantly told me that our father was still here supporting me and that I should make him proud. Today, I feel that he is with me even now,” said Pavitha, overcome with emotion. “I am very thankful to my family and teachers who pushed me to work hard despite the circumstances and, today, I know it has paid off,” she added.
 
 “I plan to finish my course and then work for a year before I become eligible to write the UPSC exam,” Pavitha told TOI. Officers IAS Academy has offered Pavitha a three-year UPSC training programme free of cost, besides taking responsibility for her semester fees. “The newspaper report helped identify her talent. She is well-deserving and was in need of support for her education when we reached out to her,” said KTS Mugundan, vice president, Officers IAS Academy.
