LUCKNOW: After the recent fire incident at   (KGMU)'s Trauma Centre, it is the old dental department building of the university which is posing a threat to life and safety of patients, students and medical professionals with deep cracks in its columns and beams. 

 Days after the fire incident,   has sought government intervention, seeking action on a previous report.
 
 Built in 1980, with a single-floor structure, the building was extended to five floors in 2005. 
 
 In 2009, the structure developed cracks and this was reported to the state government by the university administration. 
 
 A five-member probe committee was formed by the government and according to its report, the building was dangerous for use since there were deep cracks in its foundation. Water logging in the basement weakened the structure further. 
 
 In the eight years since the report, the state government has yet to take action. On July 18, a reminder seeking intervention and action was sent by KGMU officials to the medical education department. 
 
 Every day, over 500 patients visit the building, apart from medical staff and students who use the structure on a daily basis. 
 
 KGMU administration sent a reminder to the department and also asked officials of the   (AKTU) to conduct a survey of the building. 
 
 "Whatever directions the government gives will be followed," said Dr SN Sankhwar, chief medical superintendent, KGMU.
