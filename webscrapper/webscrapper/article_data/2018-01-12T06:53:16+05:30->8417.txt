LUCKNOW: Making layers of newspapers, consuming large quantities of liquor and smoking ‘beedis’ are ways the poor are resorting to while trying to battle the biting cold.

 Many of those residing in shelter homes say they cannot sleep the entire night due to the icy weather.
 
 Nights are bone-chilling for inmates of shelter homes in  ,  ,
 
 Aishbagh and  . Children without shoes or slippers shiver wearing only a sweater.
 
 In a reality check of the 21 shelter homes in the city, TOI found that the ones in Naka Hindola, Charbagh and Chinhat are the most populated.
 
 At Charbagh shelter home, some children were seen lying outside the shelter home while men were inside in one blanket.
 
 Mahesh Kumar, 42, who was shivering in one blanket, said, “I smoke three beedis daily at night to prevent shivering. I used to sleep in the daytime earlier because nights are very cold and I cannot sleep for a single minute. Now, the administration has provided me with a blanket, but that is not enough.”
 
 Shanu, an eight-year-old boy was outside the shelter home in one sweater and without slippers.
 
 “I live in Gomtinagar and used to go home once a week. Temporarily, I live in Charbagh to earn a living by polishing shoes of passengers. I spend the night outside the shelter home because there is no space inside. Most of the time, I stay awake because it is too cold,” he said.
 
 Around 10.30pm in the Naka Hindola shelter home, there were around 25 people in one hall.
 
 “We were given one blanket each. At night, when temperatures dipped, it was very difficult to sleep with one blanket. We all slept close to each other to keep warm,” said Narendra Mohan.
 
 Chander, another inmate, said, “I earn my livelihood pulling a rickshaw. At night, I need proper sleep, so I often take a peg of country-made liquor to prevent feeling cold.”
