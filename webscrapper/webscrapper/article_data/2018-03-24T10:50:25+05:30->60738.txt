They also took around Rs 50,000 from the donation box of the temple, he added.
 
 
 Temple officials said that the accused had cut the wires of CCTV cameras before committing the crime but forgot to disconnect one CCTV camera that showed that three masked persons had entered in the temple at 1.20 am and fled with cash and jewellery at 1.40 am. At that time two priests, who resided on temple premises with their families, failed to hear anything. The incident came into light when the priest woke up to answer natureâ€™s call at around 2 am and found that his room was locked from the outside. Vijender called up another priest and told him to open the door.
 
 When he came out of his room, they found that locks of the main temple were broken and doors were ajar.

Immediately they informed the police about the incident and cops from Sector 17 police station reached the spot. Dog squad and forensic team were also called up on the crime scene.
