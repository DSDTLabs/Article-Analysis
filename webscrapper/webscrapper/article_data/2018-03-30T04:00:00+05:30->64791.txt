Surat: Two groups belonging to different communities clashed with in Udhna at around 11.30 pm here on Wednesday. Young men from both the communities clashed over a month-old dispute, but timely intervention by the police brought the situation under control. Both the groups refused to lodge a complaint against each other, the police said.

 The police are facing allegations over thrashing three persons who were not involved in the clash. The three men were going on some personal work when they were thrashed, causing them severe injuries. Yash Parmar (21), his father Vinod (46) and uncle Umesh (40) were allegedly thrashed by the police at around 12.30 am on Thursday. They suffered injuries on face and all over their body, including private parts. They were admitted to the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER). 
 
 The two groups clashed at a pan shop on Madhi ni Khamni Road in Udhna. They threw stones and also attacked each other with sticks. A few vehicles parked at the spot were damaged. “Both the groups reached a compromise at the police station and hence we did not register a complaint in the incident,” an officer at Udhna police station said.
 
 “On March 1, both the groups fought when a young man from a particular community was found urinating on the wall of a residence belonging to another community. The man was nabbed by the family and community members and they thrashed him with a belt. Young men from the two sides came face-to-face with each other on Wednesday night and an argument over the old issue snowballed into a clash,” the police added.
 
 “No offence was registered since none of the groups was ready to lodge a complaint. We have started detaining people who were involved in the clash. It was basically an issue between neighbours,” deputy commissioner of police, zone I, R P Barot said.
