MUMBAI: Mekail Bora,   Bora's brother who lives in Assam, has written to   that he fears for his life.   prosecutor Bharat Badami produced in court the printout of an email from Mekail to a CBI officer. He said the email implied he wanted police protection. 

 
  The special CBI court judge said he would pass appropriate orders for the Assam police. On trial for murder and conspiracy to murder are Sheena's alleged biological mother Indrani Mukerjea and Indrani's former and present husbands, Sanjeev Khanna and Peter Mukerjea. 
 
  Mekhail, not named yet by CBI as a witness in the murder trial, wrote, "I, Mekhail Bora, have to inform you that I feel danger to my life.'' He mentioned the "probate" of a will made by his grandmother, the late Durga Ranee Bora. He said that since 2016, Hrishikesh Burgohain, executor of the will, informed him that he was in touch with Indrani. He mentioned Indrani's lawyers in the email and said that in January 2018, the court was informed that he did not want the probate. "Since then, he (Hrishikesh) has been mentally harassing me," Mekhail wrote, saying he was "scared for his life" as he stayed "all alone in the house and there is no help".
