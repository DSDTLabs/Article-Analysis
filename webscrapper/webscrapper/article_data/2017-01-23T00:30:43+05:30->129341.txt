NEW DELHI: Durga Kumari is a woman with extraordinary determination. From Banswara district of Rajasthan, 18-year-old Kumari decided to marry a differently abled man after their very first meeting, ignoring the stigma attached to such a match.

 “He likes me and I like him. We’ll have a happy married life,” Kumari said, after tying the knot at a   ceremony organised by Narayan Seva Sansthan, an NGO, at   in Punjabi Bagh.
 
 Sukhlal Bhuj, an electrician by profession, said he was motivated to do well in life when Kumari held his hands. “I have faced a lot of stigma back home since my childhood,” said Bhuj, who was afflicted with Polio when he was seven.
 
 Balu Ram, a teacher from Rajasthan, said his bride, Nani Meena, was God’s gift to him. “I had never thought in my dreams that I’ll one day marry an abled girl.” The two met in college and Meena was impressed by the fact that Ram never saw his disability as a hurdle to pursuing his dream. “I looked at his determination, not at his leg,” said Meena, a BA student.
 
 A total of 51 couples, including 31 physically challenged ones, from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, tied the knot at the biannual event on Sunday.
 
 The story of   and Ramila Katara fascinated everyone present at the ceremony. A native of Baswara district, a visually impaired Kharadia married Katara who needs all four limbs to walk. The former lost his vision when he was just seven; Katara was differently abled since birth. After the marriage, Katara promised to be Kharadia’s eyes and him her limbs.
 
 The marriages were solemnised by priests from Vrindavan. 
 
 NSS president Prashant Aggrawal said: “It’s our endeavour to help the differently abled become fully functional members of the society.”
