CHANDRAPUR: State council member of Jamat-e-Islami Hind, Dr Salim Khan has strongly objected the union governmentâ€™s decision to scrap  . He termed it as politically motivated decision and injustice against the Muslim community, during his visit to   to address a public rally.

 Had the government taken a policy decision to cancel all kind of state allocation for religious events, then there would have been no objection. But, while union and state governments continue to spend large sums on other pilgrimage and festivals,   subsidy has been deliberately cancelled for political gains, he alleged.
 
 Dr Khan slammed the government for stepping aside from its development agenda and charged it of working on its own hidden agenda.
 
 Addressing a public rally at Gandhi chowk, he emphasized that violence have no religion. I do not favour any kind of violence, but it is bitter truth that inequality is cause of violence and hatred in the society. 
 
 Guests,   deputy district chief Kishor Jorgewar and social worker   too urged people to pledge for peace and progress and strive towards replacing the atmosphere of fear with an ambience of love and brotherhood.
