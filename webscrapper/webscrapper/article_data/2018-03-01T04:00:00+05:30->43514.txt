Vadodara: Elections seem to have taken a toll on detection of crime in the jurisdiction of Vadodara rural police. Though number of crimes registered in rural areas is less compared to Vadodara city, the detection rate is quite low considering the number cases registered in police stations of rural police. 
 
 Senior officials of Vadodara rural police said that a larg force in the last quarter of 2017 was deployed in maintaining law and order so that the polls can be held smoothly. “There were many VIP visits including that of the Prime Minister and many rallies were held by other national leaders therefore our priority was that no untoward incident take place,” said a police officer adding, “The manpower which would be involved in detecting of crimes was then busy with VIP duties.” 
  
 Police said that there were more detections than the figures released but many of these were in connection with the crimes registered in Vadodara city police’s jurisdiction or in neighbouring districts of Anand and Panchmahal. 
  
 “Many detections were also of the crimes registered in the earlier years therefore they do not reflect in the data of 2017,” the police official said. 
  
 “If we see the crime figures, the rate of crime committed has come down. It is mainly because of pro-active policing and regular checking drives conducted by policemen in their areas. I used to ensure that daily drives of at least three to four hours were conducted in different parts of the district,” said Saurabh Tolumbia, superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural). 
  
 Another senior police official also said that big raids conducted in later part of 2016 including that at Akhand farm also had an impact for several months in 2017 which can be attributed to low crime rate.
