VADODARA/ ANAND: Karamsad-based Shree Krishna Hospital is likely to become Gujarat’s first hospital with highest number of ICU beds. The hospital has received support from London-based NRIs to set up Critical Care Centre which will have nearly 150 ICU beds. 

 As part of a larger expansion plan for the hospital, the ground breaking ceremony of the new building of the critical care centre which will have 112 ICU beds with a capacity to add 34 more beds later was held on Tuesday. 
 
 The proposed project which is estimated to cost Rs 18 crore is being implemented with the contribution of Rs 8 crore from Shanta Foundation, London, along with other donors. Shanta Foundation’s co-chairman   and his wife Smita Patel performed the bhoomi pujan in which other major donors from London - Subir Patel and   also remained present. 
 
 The new centre will be a great boon to the critically ill patients. The hospital currently has ICU facilities for 45 patients but the occupancy rate is very high often requiring it to refer critical patients to other hospitals, said Dr Amrita Patel, chairman of the  , which manages the hospital. 
 
 The new buildings and infrastructure are needed to cater to the increasing number of patients, most of whom come from the underprivileged society, she said. 
 
 The initiative is also part of the Rs 50 crore MoU that the hospital had signed with Gujarat government during the recent Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2017.
