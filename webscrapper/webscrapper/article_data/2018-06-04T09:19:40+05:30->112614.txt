MANGALURU:   of Kolkata and   from Mangaluru have won the   3 at Athens in Greece. Organised by the Federation of Internationale de l'automobile, it is for the first time that an Indian rally duo has won the coveted European Rally Championship.

 The Indian Duo who scripted debut victory in this class in an international rally closely contested were leading in their class right from the day one of the three day rally that passed through some torturous terrain.
 
 Ghosh, an ace driver ably co-drivered by Ashwin Naik and his immense experience left no ambiguity about this victory when they started for the last leg on Sunday. “We both drove with safety at top of our mind which gave us confidence right from the word go. We just had to bring the car to the ramp in one piece which we did with great aplomb, the duo said in a message from Athens. 
 
 Amitrrajit said, “I and Ashwin knew that we were   with an older generation of Ford Fiesta R2. Our goal was always to finish the rally with honorable points but we did it by winning the ERC 3 on the top slot which is so fulfilling."
