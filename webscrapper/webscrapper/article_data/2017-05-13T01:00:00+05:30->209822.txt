 Paying her tributes to Kishori, Girija Devi said, "Main kabhi apne se chhoton ko iss tarah se tribute nahi deti, par Kishori ke liye main mana nahi kar payi. I always pray to God asking for peace for her soul. Agar main 72 ghante bhi Kishori ke bare mein baatein karun, toh bhi baaton ke liye samay kam pad jayega. She was a bit tough in nature, but she was ultimately soft at heart. Woh bandhan mein rehne wali ladki nahi thi."
 
  
  
 
 
  
  Girija Devi, who doesn't pay tribute to younger singers, made an exception for Kishori Amonkar
 
 
  
 Amjad Ali Khan said, "She was like an elder sister to me. Jab bhi shastriya sangeet ki baat aati hai, unke gharane ka zikr hamesha aata hai. Gharanon ko lekar ladai jhagde aksar hua karte hain. She was an institution in herself, aur unhone Jaipur gharane ko apna ek chola pehnaya tha. Unhone apni ek chhaap chhor di." While Kishori tai belonged to Jaipur gharana, Ustad Amjad Ali is from Gwalior gharana and Girija Devi belongs to Banaras gharana. The latter had a close musical association with the late singer.
