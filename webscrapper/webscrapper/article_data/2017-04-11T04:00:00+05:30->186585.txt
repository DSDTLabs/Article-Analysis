Mumbai:  , CMD of budget airline  , has settled a case with markets regulator   for alleged lapses of disclosure relating to his purchase of shares of the airline from its former owners — the Maran family — in February 2015. Singh has paid Rs 2.02 lakh towards settlement with the regulator “without admitting or denying” any wrongdoing in this case, the order from the regulator said. The settlement with Sebi means the regulator would not initiate any enforcement action for the alleged defaults.

 Sebi’s High Powered Advisory Committee ( ), considered the terms of the settlement that was proposed by Singh and recommended settlement of the case after the SpiceJet chief paid Rs 2,02,500. “Accordingly, the adjudication proceedings proposed to be initiated against (Singh) for alleged violation... are settled,” the Sebi order said. 
 
 Sebi had started a probe after it found that Singh had failed to make adequate disclosures under its takeover regulations when he bought back from the Maran family the airline that he had founded and then exited a few years ago.
 
 Since the time Singh bought back SpiceJet and saved it from the brink of bankruptcy, the market value has jumped about five times to Rs 5,815 crore now. In comparison, its bigger rival   has a market value of Rs 5,802 crore.
