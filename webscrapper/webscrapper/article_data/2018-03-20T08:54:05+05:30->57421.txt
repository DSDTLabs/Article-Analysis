 Chavan told TOI Shetti's meeting with   was mainly to discuss problems faced by farmers and the March 29 meeting of various unions and organisations working for the cause of farmers. "So far, Shetti has not joined the UPA. This was the first meeting between Shetti and Rahul Gandhi on an action plan for tackling the agrarian crisis. During the Congress's plenary session, Rahul Gandhi had elaborated on the future policies of the Congress and particularly on taking up the cause of farmers," Chavan said.
 
 Shetti was first elected to the assembly in 2004 and to the Lok Sabha in 2009 from Hatkanangle in Kolhapur district. In 2014, he was re-elected to the LS after his candidature was supported by BJP. Following his differences with BJP over poor implementation of schemes for farmers, Shetti quit NDA in September last year. In the recent past, he had come down heavily on the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra over dismal implementation of the farm loan waiver scheme.
 
 If Shetti joins the UPA, it could be a major blow for the NDA as TDP has already quit and some other regional parties may follow suit.
