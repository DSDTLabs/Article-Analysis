He says, “Virtual reality has started to capture the imagination of people and PC-gaming enthusiasts like never before. Gone are the days when stepping into the world of virtual reality was confined only to science fiction movies like The Matrix, Tron or even R.A. One. With the latest technology, people can experience a flight of fantasy into the world of virtual reality. Though VR games is a new thing for Mysureans, it is becoming popular. The number of people playing these games is more during weekends and holidays. With many devices entering into the market, VR games are here to stay and it is the game for the future generation.”
  
  A gaming enthusiast, Rashmi   says, “The games literally take us to a different world. It gives us the feeling that the games are being played in the real world. I was nervous when I played for the first time, but now it thrills me to play such games.”
