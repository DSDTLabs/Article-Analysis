AHMEDABAD: In a   dated February 3,   A K Singh has asked his subordinates from   (JCPs) to   to listen to the issues of   and Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) jawans. 

 The circular mentions that there should be a proper channel of representing the issue so that it gets vent ‘the other way.’ While the circular cites recent firing case by a paramilitary force jawan for denying leave, the recent times have seen a number of videos from jawans of Indian Army and paramilitary forces surfacing, complaining about the conditions they face.
 
 ‘Police constables are in a very large number in the force and they are the first contact point for citizens. Their conduct makes or breaks the image of police and thus they should feel that there is somebody to listen to and resolve their issues,’ reads the circular.
 
 The circular cites issues ranging from issues of accommodation and salary to police station level issues such as favouritism and distribution of work. It also mentions health issues and issues of leave. Singh mentions in the circular that there should be a humane approach while considering leaves and there should be adherence to Gujarat Police Manual.
 
 ‘There should be an environment where the constables and LRDs, who should be given more attention due to their fixed pay, can meet the officers without any formality and discuss their issues. I ask JCP/additional CP/DCP/ACP/inspectors and commandants to meet the constables between 3 pm and 4 pm on Thursdays. The constables can also meet commissioner between 11 am and 1 pm every Friday,’ reads the circular.
