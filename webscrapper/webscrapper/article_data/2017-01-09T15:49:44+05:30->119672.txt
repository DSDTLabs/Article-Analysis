Television actor   is cheerful on his birthday and seems more than excited to put up his celebration pictures on Instagram. The actor, who is currently seen on the show   opposite   Sengar has turned a year older today.
 
  
 
  
  Surrounded by pink balloons, Sharad is sitting in the centre with his dog "Chotu" in his arms in one of the pictures posted by him on Instagram. He has captioned the picture, "And the b'day begins...😍😍😍 Thankuuuuu chotu !!!!"
  
  
  
  Sharad is one of the most sought after actors in the television industry.
  
  Apart from appearing in the fiction show, that he is currently a part of, Sharad had also tried a hand in comedy by appearing on Comedy Nights Bachao Taaza. When the actor found it difficult to juggle between Comedy Nights Bachao and Kasam, he quit the former.
  
  We wish the actor a very Happy Birthday.
