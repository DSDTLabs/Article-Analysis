Controversial senior IPS officer Indu Kumar   has been compulsorily retired by the central government in ‘public interest’. A 1989 ADG-rank officer of Rajasthan cadre awaiting posting order, Bhushan is reportedly the state’s first IPS officer to be retired compulsorily.

 The letter by the central government, dated March 29, stated that the IPS officer is retired in public interest in accordance with section 16(3) of All India Service (DCRB) rules 1958.
  
  
 “The central government may, in consultation with the state government concerned, require a member of the service to retire from service in public interest after giving such member at least threemonth notice in writing or three-month pay and allowances in lieu of such a notice,” the said section reads.
 
 
 
 
 Sources told 
  that the Central government had set up a committee headed by the chief secretary in 2017 on 21 IPS officers in the state. The committee recommended that 20 officials should be retained while Bushan should be retired.
 
 In his 28 years of service, Bhushan was under APO (awaiting posting order) five times. He was rarely given district postings and spent most of his career in administrative duties such in headquarters and jails.
 
 His career has been marked with controversies. The state government was left red-faced when in 2016 the official was shunted out of   ( ) in Hyderabad for misbehaving with Telangana & AP governor E S L Narasimhan.
 
 In October 2017, Bhushan made sensational allegation that the police were planning to arrest him as he had spoken against the ‘prevailing corruption’ in the department. In a press conference he held at his house, Bhushan had made allegations of corruption, impropriety and misuse of office against several IPS officers, including the then DGP Ajit Singh.
