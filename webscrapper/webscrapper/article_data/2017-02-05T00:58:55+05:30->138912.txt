MUMBAI: The BJP-led   will be a major beneficiary of NDA government’s decision to enhance the budgetary provision under the   (EGS) in the ensuing financial year.

 “The   has made a provision of Rs 48,000 crore for the EGS for 2017-18. We expect a reimbursement of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, while the state government will spend Rs 3,000 crore from its own funds,’’ a senior bureaucrat told TOI.
 
 The bureaucrat said that in the wake of the worst-ever drought in 1972, the state government had drafted an ambitious employment guarantee scheme to provide employment to unskilled rural population on demand. Subsequently, in 1977, a landmark legislation, the Maharashtra Rural Employment Guarantee Act, was passed. As a result, it was mandatory for the state government to provide employment to rural population. “Impressed by our legislation, the Centre in 2005 too passed a legislation, National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, to provide jobs to rural population. Then the Centre decided to provide employment for at least 100 days to rural population. Following the legislation, while wages for 100 days of employment are paid by the Centre, for the remaining days in the year, the state government has taken responsibility to provide employment,’’ he said.
 
 Elaborating on the type of works, the bureaucrat said the aim of the scheme is to create assets in rural areas, mainly to tackle drought. “We concentrate on activities like water conservation, construction of irrigation canals, rural roads and flood control activities. We provide work on demand to everyone,’’ he said.
 
 He said now since the NDA government has enhanced the budget, the state government will be able to generate more  . As on January 28, 2017, 2.28 lakh labourers were paid Rs 1,799 crore — as against Rs 1,351 crore to 3.13 lakh labours on the same day in January 2016. “In 2017-18, we expect to spend Rs 3,000 crore on the EGS. In addition, we expect massive reimbursement from the centre. Entire payment is online, so that there is no scope for corruption or irregularities,’’ he said.
 
 The bureaucrat said maximum labourers were reporting in tribal areas of Thane, Palghar, Dhule, Amravati, Chandrapur and Nandurbar.
