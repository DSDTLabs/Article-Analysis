HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Tuesday changed the names of five of the 21-newly created districts. It may be recalled that the government a few months ago, reorganized the 10 districts of Telangana into 31 by dividing the existing ones. As the government was preparing the final districts list, there were several demands about naming of some of the new districts.

 In its orders on Tuesday, the government said the Bhadradri district will henceforth be officially known as Bhadradri-Kothagudem while the   district will be officially called Jogulamba-Gadwal. Similarly, the   district has been renamed Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri while the   district has been rechristened Rajanna-Siricilla district.And, making amends to the Komaram Bheem ( ) district's spelling, the government, said the district will henceforth be spelt Kumuram Bheem.
