A chemical engineer with a management degree,   gave up a 15-year corporate career, to follow his heart and that has till date, earned him over 1,500 concerts across 15 countries. 

 His training in Hindustani light   and ghazals began when he was just seven, and later, he also acquired formal training in Western music. Ameya, who sings and enjoys all genres says, “Music with a message is my motto. 
 
 I firmly believe that it is the strongest means of communication, which connects and bonds people together.” Ameya’s new musical concept ‘Heart 2 Heart’ is a melodious embellishment of ghazals and Sufi music celebrating love and romance, while the other, ‘Ekam Satt’, showcases the works of global saints and spreads the message of ‘One World Family’ across cultures.
