Kolkata: President   on Thursday appealed to the public not to vandalize hospitals if a family member dies during treatment. At the same time, Mukherjee also told doctors to serve patients with a human touch.

 “Whenever a patient dies, there is a cry of negligence with people resorting to vandalizing hospitals. It is not done. However advanced may be medical science, it cannot guarantee to save lives. All that doctors can do is give their best,” the   said while inaugurating the   of Liver and Digestive Sciences on Thursday.
 
 Mukherjee also said patients’ families should be ready for the expenses if they seek treatment in the private sector.
 
 “It is good that the chief minister has spoken to all stakeholders and has taken stock of the situation. As someone elder to her, I bless her and wish her success in her endeavours,” Mukherjee said to Mamata Banerjee who shared the dais with him.
 
  “A smiling face can cure half the disease,” the President said while coaxing doctors to tend to patients with a human touch.
 
 For IILDS, Mukherjee said the hospital — only of its kind in the eastern region exclusively for liver aliments — will be of great service to the people of this region.
 
 “The county has to make better effort to take education and healthcare to the people. We are still unable to give quality health service to the rural population,” said Mukherjee.
