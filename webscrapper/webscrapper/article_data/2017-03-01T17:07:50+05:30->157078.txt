MAHARAJGANJ: Prime Minister   on Wednesday took a jibe at Congress leader   for his "coconut juice" and "potato factory" remarks.

 "There is a Congress leader, and I want to pray for his long life...he recently went to   to address an election rally. There he told farmers that he would extract juice from coconuts and send it to London. In fact, a coconut possesses water (and not juice) and it is grown in Kerala," he said addressing a rally here.
 
 "It is like setting up a potato factory," Modi said referring to Rahul Gandhi's earlier remarks that he wants to set up potato factories in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 "Such a talented and far-sighted leader he is," Modi said, and asked Rahul as to what he exactly he wanted to do for UP.
 
 Addressing a poll rally in Manipur on Tuesday, the Congress leader had reportedly said, "I would want when someone drinks coconut juice in London and sees 'Made in Manipur' written on it."
 
 Rahul Gandhi had earlier told farmers in Uttar Pradesh that "You all are demanding a potato factory in your area, but you should understand I am an opposition leader, I can put pressure on the government, but cannot take the decision. I cannot open a potato factory for farmers".
