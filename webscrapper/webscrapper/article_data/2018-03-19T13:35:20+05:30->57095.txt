The film that became a cult classic over the years and spurned a superhit sequel a few years later, Priyadarshan’s ‘Hera Pheri’ cannot be thought of without Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal and   in it. Things could have turned out very differently if producer Firoz Nadiadwala’s plans to star   in the character played by Suniel. Sanju had to leave the film because he had to attend the court proceedings regularly and he could only do night scenes. He told   that after completing ‘Kartoos’, he could not do any film for a short period, so he suggested that Suniel Shetty should take his place in the film.
