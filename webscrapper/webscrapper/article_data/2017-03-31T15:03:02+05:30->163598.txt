It isn't just humans who are misusing over the-counter medicines. Their pet friends are suffering too.

 Doctors have expressed alarm over a number of pet stores doling out high-end antibiotics, analgesics and anti-fungal   which can have serious side-effects like diarrhoea, allergies and even death of animals if administered inappropriately or in excess. Besides, the misuse of the drugs increases the risk of animals suffering resistance like humans.
 
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted a series of raids on pet stores in Mumbai, Thane and Pune for illegally stocking antibiotics and other prescription drugs.Pet medicines worth Rs 4.5 lakh have been seized so far.
 
 FDA commissioner Dr Harshadeep Kamble said the department was forced to foray into the area of pet medication after their rampant abuse was brought to its notice three months ago. Last we ek, the FDA served notices on eight pet shops, including five from the city , for acting as pharmacies without holding a valid licence or hiring qualified pharmacists. Besides high-end antibiotics, analgesics and anti-fungal drugs, some of them were also found to be selling schedule H drugs without prescription. These drugs require stringent record-keeping.
 
 “Our vigilance department found that unqualified people were giving drugs to   who cannot even complain if they suffer from side effects,“ Kamble said, adding that a quality test of medicines was on the cards.
 
 Mumbai's vets have hailed the crackdown on pet shops. Dr Rustom Bharucha,   expert from Gamdevi, said several owners prefer to approach pet shops first before consulting a doctor. “Pet shop owners do not just offer advice, they even prescribe medicines without understanding the symptoms. When it doesn't give the desired effect, they come to a doctor. It is a dangerous practice,“ he said.
