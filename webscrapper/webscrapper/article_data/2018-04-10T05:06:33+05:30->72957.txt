MUMBAI: The   on Monday did not vacate the stay on the Bombay high court order restraining the municipal commissioner to sanction felling of up to 25 trees at one go in the city.

 The SC was hearing a special leave petition by the civic tree authority for permission to challenge the HC order.
 
 In February, the HC had restrained the   from processing nearly 50 proposals for cutting 800 trees after hearing a PIL by activist   challenging the constitutional validity of Section 8(6) of the   (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees (Amendment) Act on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. The new law permits the municipal commissioner to sanction tree-cutting when applications are filed for less than 25 trees.
 
 Applications to fell more than 25 trees go to the civic tree authority.
 
 While the Bombay high court will hear matter on April 16, the Supreme Court has posted its next hearing on April 20.
