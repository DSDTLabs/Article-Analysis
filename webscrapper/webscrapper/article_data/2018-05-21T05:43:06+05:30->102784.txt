Varanasi airport would soon gain international status,” he said while addressing the International Peace and Equality Convention at Suresh Bhatt auditorium.

 Some activists had created ruckus in the convention on Saturday. They had alleged that while it had been organized by social justice department it was more of a BJP programme.

 State social justice minister Rajkumar Badole targeting the miscreants said that his government was beyond caste and did not believe in casteist politics. “We have solved the Indu Mill problem, purchased Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s house in London and have sanctioned Rs100 crore for beautification of Deekshabhoomi. This shows that we work for all communities,” he added.
