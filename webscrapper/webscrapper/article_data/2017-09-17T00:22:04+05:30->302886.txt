Bhopal: Two days before the BJP’s meeting at Kerwa Dam, former Union minister and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath tweeted on chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s `picnic’ meetings with his ministers. On September 14, the Congress leader’s twitter handle @Officeof KN said, “Instead of Hanumantiya, Shivraj should have his next `picnic’ cabinet meeting in the submergence areas of Sardar Sarovar.” A second tweet followed, “This way he (CM Chouhan) and his ministers would get the time to see the continuous rising water levels and the areas on the verge of submergence.”

 These tweets were perhaps the reason that the BJP on Saturday were unsure of the venue for the party top-brass meeting. First, it was scheduled in the forests of Ratibad, but was cancelled because the venue would attract the attention of the media since it is the monsoon and entry into forest sanctuaries is prohibited during this time. The meeting at chief minister’s official residence was also cancelled and the venue shifted was to a guest house near Kerwa Dam. Here, there was no picnic as mocked by Kamal Nath. Instead, the leaders walked inside closed doors and emerged only after the meeting was over, more than eight hours later.
