* Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday spoke to   CM Chandrababu Naidu amid political tension between   and   over granting special status to the state, ANI reported.

 
 * The two TDP ministers in the Union Cabinet will meet PM Modi at 6pm today. They were directed on Wednesday by the Andhra Pradesh CM to submit their resignations.
 
 * Earlier on Thursday, ANI reported that BJP ministers in the Andhra Pradesh government, Dr Kamineni Srinivas and Pydikondala Manikyala Rao, resigned from the state cabinet.
 
 * "Our ministers in central cabinet and BJP ministers in our cabinet have resigned. However, these ministers worked good in the state. They brought considerable reforms in their departments. I thank them for their services," Chandrababu Naidu said in the state Assembly today following news of the BJP ministers' resignations.
 
 *Speaking in the state Assembly today, Naidu also accused the Centre of "holding the hand" of northeastern states, but not doing the same for Andhra Pradesh. He demanded to know the reason for this "discrimination."
 
 *Civil aviation minister P Ashok Gajapati Raju and Union minister of science and technology YS Chowdary, both of whom belong to the TDP, are expected to submit their resignations, a day after their party attacked the BJP government at the Centre for "betraying" Andhra Pradesh.
 
 "Let us not get confused. When the state of Andhra Pradesh was made, the people did not want to be treated as residue material. There were some assurances made. UPA government made some commitments. Now these commitments are the questions," Raju said.
 
 * On Wednesday, Naidu said, "We have taken the decision to pull out two TDP ministers, civil aviation minister P Ashok Gajapati Raju and Union minister of science and technology Srujana Chowdary, from the Union cabinet as all our efforts to get special category status failed. It was a last resort decision."
 
 * Naidu's remarks came hours after Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said the Centre could not accommodate TDP's demands for "special category" status or tax relief for the state.
 
 * Jaitley said that while the Centre would give assistance equivalent to Special Category status, the designation itself could not be conferred because it has ceased to exist after the implementation of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. 
 
 * The TDP has 16 members in the Lok Sabha and four in the Rajya Sabha.
