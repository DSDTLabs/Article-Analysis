Though there might be a lot of chat shows with celebrities on Tamil television,   says that the reason she chose to host   is because she gets to be herself on the show. “The show has a certain format, where we go through the celebrity's life. I am more comfortable doing the anchoring part because I know a lot of people from the industry personally . With a few people, I know almost everything about their lives. And a few others whom I may not have worked with, I at least have some kind of association with them. For instance, I haven't worked with   sir. But I know about him through several people.   is a good friend, too. When I have people like them on the show, I get to be myself,“ says Suhasini, adding, “You have a good chance of getting candid conversations on the show since you have a previous association. And yes, unlike other chat shows, this one's quite different. That's one of the reasons why I opted to take it up.“
