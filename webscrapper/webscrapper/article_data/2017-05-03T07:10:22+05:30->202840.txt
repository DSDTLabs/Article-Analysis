INDORE: Following the order passed by the   of   regarding disbursement of grant to the NGO running institute of   in Dhar, the state government deposited an amount of Rs 4.83 lakh in the account of NGO against their pending dues.

 An affidavit was submitted by the district project officer stating this on record before the bench of Justice Prakash Shirvastava on Tuesday. However, compliance of another direction, regarding submission of details of advertisements inviting new care taking NGOs for such institutions, had not been done.
 
 The court in its order dated April 3 had taken on record the petitioner’s grievance that the grant had not been disbursed to the NGO since a long time due to which the deaf and dumb students were facing problems. It had also been stated before the court that the lack of funds were adversely affecting the therapy sessions, educational visits, scholarships and the hostel facilities for the students.
 
 “The amount which was due was to the tune of Rs 5.8 lakh, out of which Rs 4.83 lakh was deposited in the NGO’s account on April 28. As of now, Rs. 90,000 is still pending. The respondents did not comply with the court’s order seeking details of advertisements seeking new care takers for the deaf-and dumb institutes in the state, even when the current organization’s contract was in effect,” Ashish CHoubey, counsel to the petitioner organization Anand Service Society said.
 
 Anand Service society has been running the deaf-and-dumb institute in Dhar since 2009. The tender of the society was renewed at annual basis. However, the district administration issued advertisement inviting new applicants to take care of the institute in September 2016, which was challenged by the organization in court seeking a stay on advertisement.
 
 The stay was granted by the court on the last date of hearing, and on Tuesday, time was granted to the petitioners to verify the affidavit submitted in the matter.
