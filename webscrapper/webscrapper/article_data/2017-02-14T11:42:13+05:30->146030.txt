VADODARA: A group of activists along with parents from poor financial backgrounds on Monday staged a token hunger strike outside the Vadodara district education officer (DEO) demanding abolition of online process adopted for granting admission under the Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009. 

 The group raised slogans against the decision on the grounds that many parents find it difficult and expensive to follow the online process. 
 
 “Also, there are eight category of children including orphans, destitutes and HIV infected who have the right to get admission. Who will fill up their forms?,” said social worker Harshad Bhuta. 
 
 “As per RTE, there should be 25 % reservation for the poor in the schools. But there is no transparency in its implementation. The process should have been completed between December and January. But when the parents approach officers in DEO office, they are not given proper answers,” he said. 
 
 “There are 150 such parents who are making follow ups since a month. Now, they have lost patience. If the situation does not improve now, we will be forced to sit on indefinite hunger strike,” he said.
