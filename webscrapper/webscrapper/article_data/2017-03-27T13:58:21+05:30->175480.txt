BHOPAL: In yet another instance of   in  , dogs have eaten up the body of a 70-year-old woman who went missing from a government hospital in Rajgarh on March 22. This is the fifth such incident in the state in less than 10 months.

 Some   chanced upon the grisly remains when they went looking for the source of the stench that had been troubling patients and doctors for the past few days. “Only her head and some upper body parts were left. The rest had been eaten up by animals,” said   incharge Mukesh Gaur. It is not yet known if she was alive when the animals attacked. There were signs of the body being dragged five to seven feet through the undergrowth.
 
 What adds to the horror is that hospital authorities were apparently unaware that Bishmillah Bai was missing until they found what was left of her in the backyard of the campus on Sunday.
