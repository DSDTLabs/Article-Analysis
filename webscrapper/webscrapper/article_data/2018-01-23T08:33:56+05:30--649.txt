There is an alarming surge of Type 2   as young as 12 in the city. Doctors say that the number of children having   Type 2 has increased by 10-15% when compared to five years back.

 “At present one or two in 10 kids visiting endocrinologists are being diagnosed with this lifestyle disease. We are seeing many in their early teens with diabetes,” points out Dr Arun Mukka, consultant endocrinologist, Yashoda hospital Somajiguda. While diabetes occurs when the body can’t control blood glucose levels, Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease which can be avoided unlike Type 1 diabetes which is unavoidable as it is due to genetic reasons. One of the key reasons behind the surge in childhood diabetes cases is obesity.
 
 “Over-weight and obesity in childhood has both immediate and long term health concerns. Increasingly, youngsters are being diagnosed with an alarming range of health conditions. Type 2 diabetes cases in such children are a reason of concern. In near future almost one in five children would have encountered Type 2 diabetes in Hyderabad,” pointed out Dr K S Lakshmi, senior consultant - laproscopic and bariatric surgery of   Global Hospitals.
  
  
 As per a survey conducted by   16-17% of kids in Hyderabad are obese and at-least 80% of these kids will grow up to become obese men and women. In case of children with diabetes, it can be reversed if detected in early stages with proper treatment .
 
 However, if not responded to properly it becomes an irreversible disease leading to lifelong medication. If blood glucose levels stay high for too long there are chances of it damaging the eyes, kidneys and nerves. High risk groups are the ones with a family history of obesity and any person who does not participate in physical activities.
 
 To avoid Type 2 diabetes, youngsters should indulge in 60 minutes of physical activities every day, limit sweetened drinks, eat fruits & vegetables and avoid junk food.
