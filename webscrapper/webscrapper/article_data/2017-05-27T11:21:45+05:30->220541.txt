JAIPUR: A large number of liquor shops have been operating illegally in   village of Kishanganj tehsil in Baran district. Many of these are functioning close to schools, some very close to settlements of the Sahariya tribals. Women in these areas have been protesting that these shops are disrupting their lives, drawing men into alcoholism and deepening their poverty. However, the local administration has been slow to act.

  of the excise department in Baran district told Firoz Khan, a social activist who raised the matter, that he had no knowledge of the functioning of these shops, and would investigate whether any of them are indeed operating illegally now that he has been told. “If they are indeed operating without permission or licence, the law will take its course,” he said.
 
 Firoz Khan, who regularly tours these villages as part of his work, told TOI that women had been gathering to protest in the village at different spots. He said the shops had come up close to the school at Sripuri, near the anganwadi in Gigcha, near the Sahariya settlement in   and at   near a school.
 
 “The sale of liquor from these illegal outlets is taking place regularly as law enforcers seem to look the other way,” he said.
 
 Yashoda, a resident of a Sahariya colony, said, “There is nothing to stop this illegal activity, and our men blow up all the money they earn in liquor. Our protests fall on deaf ears.”
