MANGALURU: In order to improve SSLC results in   district, zilla panchayath CEO M R Ravi and chairman of standing committee on education and heath   have written to Muslim clerics asking them to ensure their students spend more time on study than religious and social activities till SSLC examinations are over. TOI has a copy of the letter. 

 The letter states that last year 2,212 students out of the 8,860 from Muslim community have failed in SSLC exam. This is a serious issue. To improve results this academic year, the department of public instruction is working tirelessly and the community involvement will play a positive role in improving the results. So, leaders and clerics from Muslim community have a bigger role to create awareness among the parents and the children, states the letter.
 
 The letter further reads: Awareness should be created during the Friday prayers. The clerics must request students to give-up religious and social programmes till SSLC examinations are over. Our sole aim is that no child should lag behind in studies and it’s our social responsibility. We are doing this keeping in mind Muslim children.
 
 “This idea came to us during a recent meeting that we should write to the community leaders and the clerics with a request to ensure SSLC students cut down their Madrassa studies during examination and concentrate on academics,” said M R Ravi. 
 
 Mangaluru south, north and Bantwal education blocks have the highest number of   in SSLC. In the past, the education department officials used to conduct multiple meetings with the parents, religious leaders and the students asking them give up Madrassa classes during evening time and concentrate on SSLC examination. “The response was positive and we find many students focusing on the board examination,” says an education department official.
