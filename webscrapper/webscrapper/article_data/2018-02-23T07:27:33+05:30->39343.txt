HYDERABAD: After putting it on hold over alignment issues, the   (TRS) government finally took a positive call on the   through the   due to rising demand and protests by the public and political parties ever since the stretch from Nagole to Miyapur was thrown open in November last year.

 As of now,   Rail works are being taken up on Corridor II (JBS to Falaknuma) only up to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS). The 6km stretch from MGBS to Falaknuma was temporarily shelved after the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) opposed the alignment. Raising objection to the proposed acquisition of 1,100 properties en route the Metro, the MIM suggested an alternative route along the Musi and the Hyderabad High Court.
 
  
 
 MIM later softened its stand and said it is not against the Metro Rail in Old City. The party MLAs, including floor leader  , demanded the service in Old City. The BJP and the   too questioned the government on the delay in taking a decision on the Old City stretch even as it cleared the contentious stretches through Sultan Bazaar and Assembly.
 
 Official sources said L&T was given the project cost of ₹14,132 crore for the entire 72 km Metro plan. The project was supposed to be completed by July 2017 as per agreement. But the delay in handing over the right of way led to a revised deadline of November 2018.
 
 “If L&T takes up the work, it would take one year to complete the project. Acquiring 1,100 properties, including 35 religious structures, will be a Herculean task,” a senior GHMC official said.
 
 Municipal administration department principal secretary, Arvind Kumar, said the government is keen on completing the pending Metro stretches, including JBS to MGBS, before the November deadline.
