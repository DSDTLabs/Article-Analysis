Ahmedabad: A 69-year-old man was duped of gold ornaments worth Rs 25,000 by three police impersonators on Monday. According to the complaint by Bharat Shah, 69, a resident of Vallabh Apartments in Bodakdev, he was returning home at 8.30am on May 15, when a man on a motorcycle stopped him. The man identified himself as a policeman and told him that checking was under way as there had been a robbery in the vicinity.

 “In an elaborate set-up, two other persons stopped a man. The man asked for their police identity cards and after confirming their identities handed over their valuables for checking. Shah followed suit. Later, when Shah opened the handkerchief, his ring and chain, worth Rs 25,000, were gone,” said an official.
