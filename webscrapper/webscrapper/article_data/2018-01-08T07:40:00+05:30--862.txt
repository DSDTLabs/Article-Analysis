MC ready | Councillors to give inputs, parking fee to be charged only after first hour

 Mohali:   might start in the city in a few days. The municipal corporation house has agreed unanimously to bring about the agenda in its next meeting after the proposal from mayor Kulwant Singh found a surprising support on Sunday after a long opposition, so far.
 
 The members who have turned in favour now say that the chaotic situation in the Mohali market lots has taken the customers away to Chandigarh, where they find proper parking space. “Parking brawls are regular in the Mohali markets,” councillor Kamaljit Ruby said, while seconding the mayor’s proposal for introducing paid parking.
 
 The mayor said: “Paid parking is need of the hour, since the situation at the markets has unmanageable. Wrong and haphazard parking is leading to scuffles. Traders have been complaining of losing customers to Chandigarh, since the shoppers find no proper space to park in the Mohali markets.” The mayor also requested the councillors for inputs from the local markets in their wards, so that the objections and suggestions might help in drafting the paid-parking agenda.
 
 Mayor Kulwant Singh also suggested that the first hour of parking be made free, and subsequently a parking fee be charged for every hour. In March 2014, when the paid-parking system was last introduced in Mohali, it had failed to survive public opposition. The parking fee was then Rs 2 for two-wheelers and Rs 5 for four-wheelers.
 
 The paid-parking system in the town’s markets was abolished in April 2016 after once being introduced in select markets in March 2014.
