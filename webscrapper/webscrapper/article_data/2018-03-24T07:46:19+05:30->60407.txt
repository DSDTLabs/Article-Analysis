AHMEDABAD: Residents of Vastrapur have launched a   protest to save a 70-year-old  , which stands beside the road at Vastrapur Gam and the   (AMC) seemed to have deferred cutting down the tree.

 Madhu Menon, city-based environmentalist, said the protest began after he took up the issue on social media after a friend of his, a scientist at Isro, told him that the tree was about to chopped down for road widening.
 
 “I took it as my responsibility, formed a group and the matter went viral in a few hours. I started getting responses from so many people, including some AMC officials. It seems that social media became so active that it could save a tree,” Menon said.
 
 Menon added, “It is not just a tree but an ecosystem. The banyan tree has a lot of cultural things associated with it and hundreds of birds come to roost in it in the evening. If the tree is saved, many other life forms can be accommodated.”
 
 “AMC officials have given an assurance but they can still cut it down,” he said.
 
 AMC officials said they have not yet decided on cutting down the banyan tree. “We understand religious sentiments of people and currently, we have not taken any decision. Only demolition orders have been issued for illegal constructions beside the road,” said Jignesh Patel, AMC’s director of parks and gardens.
 
 Mukesh Kumar, municipal commissioner, said, “We are in the process of finding a technical solution to the problem and we will take a call accordingly.”
