THANE: Cases of   among children are on the rise in the city, say doctors. The usual complaints among children have been running nose, cough or body ache which progresses into acute wheezing, difficulty in breathing, irritation, vomiting and sleeplessness.

 While doctors advise that the spread of the illness can be curbed with basic measures like hand hygiene and avoiding physical contact with an infected person, the primary reason for the escalation is the poor quality of air and the sudden shifts in temperature.
 
 The neighbourhood general physician and the paediatricians in the city have become compelled to prescribe multiple antibiotics to counter the illness, with a section of the medical fraternity stating that the overexposure to antibiotics would be counter-productive as the bacteria could turn resistant to the common medicines. 
 
 “We prescribe antibiotics if the flu is severe. Home remedies like taking steam help if it’s mild. These viruses last in the body for usually four days to a week,” said Dr Anand Bedekar, a Thane-based paediatrician.
 
 While these upper   tract ailments start with a mere cough or sneeze, doctors say, if untreated, the flu could lead to bronchitis and in some cases even asthama. 
 
 “More than adults, children are suffering from these incections,” said Dr Rahul Kulkarni, an ENT specialist.
