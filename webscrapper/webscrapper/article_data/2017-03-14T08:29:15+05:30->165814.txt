BENGALURU: Inspired by the concentrated efforts of a core team which marketed 'Brand Modi' prior to the 2014 elections and the recent   polls, JD(S) state president   on Monday launched a   by creating personal accounts to interact with people online. 

  Under the name of Namma HDK, the JD(S) state president has opened accounts on Facebook, Twitter, SoundCloud, Google Plus and YouTube to connect with voters ahead of the 2018 assembly election. "The influence of the social media on elections cannot be ignored any more. In UP, the   used 11,000 WhatsApp groups to connect with voters. These accounts have been launched to remind the people of my achievements as a chief minister and spell out my vision for the state," Kumaraswamy told reporters. As many as 35 to 40 qualified people will handle the accounts. 
 
  The JD(S) state president said he will dedicate at least one hour every month to have direct interaction online with people. On being reminded that he had launched the same exercise prior to the 2013 assembly elections and renewed the same before the 2014 parliamentary elections, Kumaraswamy admitted that they had failed to take off. "We had used the same sort of platforms prior to the previous elections, but failed to sustain them after the polls. This time I will be personally using the space before and after the 2018 elections, until I retire from pub lic life," he said.
