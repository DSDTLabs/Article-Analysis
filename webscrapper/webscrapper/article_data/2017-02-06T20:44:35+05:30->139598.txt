Having said that, I would say any head of state cannot be bullied by the press, nor can he ignore the voice of the media. Often, a revolutionary idea, or something different, is criticised by the public, but at the same time one needs to respect the sentiments of the public as well. It's a very tough job for a head of state, that too when someone is new in the system.
 
 Any head of state cannot have only yes men around him; he must have honest advisors. He needs to keep disruptive people also in his team because they can see the point from a very different angle so they enrich one's course of action. Hence a leader like Trump needs to include the dissenters among his advisors, and take into account counterpoints as well.
 
 
 
 India is the largest democracy and   the oldest, so naturally, they can be good partners and the relationship needs to be strengthened by easing many regulations between the countries.
 
 I would not like to comment on Trump’s seven-nation ban since a federal judge has already ruled on that. But now there is a quota system for all countries, for India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and so on but all the quotas (to grant visa) are the same. This requires some rethinking — perhaps the quota system can be decided on merit and the population.
 
 These are some of the things that could bring us closer. Cultural and economic ties are important to enable greater cooperation between countries.
 
 
 
 I am always for disarmament, whichever country on the planet we are talking about. I would suggest, that countries should spend at least a fraction — say 1or 2% — of defence spending on peace education. Today, America needs peace education very badly.
 
 Depression is taking over the country. While economic interests need to be considered, you also have to consider the happiness index of a country. We (Art of Living) have a project called ‘Welcome Home Troops’, via our Association for Human Values. We have so far trained 1,500 troops who have returned from the Iraq war, and rehabilitated them. We made a movie called ‘Almost Sunrise’ that tells the story of a soldier, a war veteran — what his life was post war and how he transformed after AOL programmes. You know, seven soldiers are committing suicide in America every day. This is a big blot on America — that people who defend their country commit suicide. This is something America needs to look into and we hope comto work with them. And there has to be some kind of gun regulation, and awareness created on the need to be peaceful.
 
 Another thing: America’s infrastructure has taken a big beating in the recent past. I am sure President Trump will take positive steps to deal with this. Young people need to be encouraged to get involved more.
 
 Trump would do well to take everyone along - whether youth, women, LGBT community, or other ethnic groups. Because India and America have the unique advantage of multiculturalism and pluralism, mutlti-ethnicities so it is important to take along all sections of people to make America vibrant and great. No country can be great if even a small minority in the country feels neglected. So Trump needs to build confidence. 
 
 
 
 Fears are unfounded because any head of state will always think of everyone, once they get into that seat. They will care of the whole population. But sometimes that idea may not percolate to the ground. I would recommend to Trump to pay heed to the words of Gorakhnath: “Speak not in haste (without understanding), walk not in haste (without knowing the path). Take slow cautious steps (in the path of yoga). Let not pride overtake you. Lead a simple life (free of passions), says Goraknath.”
 
 Tranquility of mind is absolutely essential for making decisions that would bring long-term happiness to people. I would say to Trump, take a few moments before taking decisions; please set apart an introspective moment of silence.
