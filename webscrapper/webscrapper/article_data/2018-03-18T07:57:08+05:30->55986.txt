COLVA: South Goa additional sessions court on Saturday ordered former tourism minister Francisco ‘Mickky’   not to enter the Utorda for a period of 60 days and Betalbatim for a fortnight while granting him conditional anticipatory bail in an alleged case of threatening.

 Pacheco sought anticipatory bail after Verna police booked him for driving his vehicle on the beach in a rash and negligent manner thereby endangering the complainant’s life and safety.
 
 Complainant Melroy da Silva alleged that Pacheco drove over his   and thereafter threatened him with dire consequences in filthy language.
 
 The police also submitted that the video recorded by Silva on his mobile phone shows the “criminality and high-handedness of the accused”.

 Judge Sayanora Laad allowed Pacheco’s anticipatory bail application against a bond of Rs 20,000 and a surety of a like amount. She also directed that the police can take him into custody for a limited period for facilitating recovery.
 
 In 2015, Pacheco, who was then rural development minister, was convicted for assaulting a government servant and sentenced to six months imprisonment.
