Ignoring security concerns only to ensure benefit to a private developer, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) sanctioned a rehabilitation scheme adjacent to sensitive installations such as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL). The developer benefited by Rs 156 crore as Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in lieu of constructing 8,582 tenements for the SRA. Describing the extent to which the SRA violated rules, the CAG report states the authority ignored a general directive issued by the   urban development department that an NOC shall be obtained before granting any permission for building proposals on land near defence or security-related organisations within the BMC’s jurisdiction. It disregarded the security concerns raised by BARC and HPCL and sanctioned (January 2012) construction of 59 rehabilitation buildings (70m high) on the net available plot area of around 22 acres. 

 While changing the use of plot from special industrial zone to residential zone, the BMC imposed a condition of leaving a segregating distance of 52m from the boundary of the HPCL refinery as it is a hazardous industry. The SRA did not adhere to this condition either while sanctioning the construction of rehabilitation buildings. In October 2013, the chief secretary endorsed the security concerns and observed that the project may be scrapped.
