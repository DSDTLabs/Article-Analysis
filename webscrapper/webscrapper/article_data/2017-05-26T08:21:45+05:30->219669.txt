NEW DELHI: The much-awaited   linking ITO with   is going to open soon, most likely this weekend. Trial runs on the ITO-Kashmere Gate section had begun on August 10, 2016.

 “The 5.17km-long section has been given the safety nod by commissioner of metro railway safety (CMRS) for starting commercial services,” said a   (DMRC) spokesperson. The safety inspection began on Monday and concluded on Tuesday.
 
 Though DMRC is tight-lipped about the exact date on which it plans to open the section to public, sources said that operations are likely to start by Sunday. This entirely underground section comprises four stations — Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate.
 
 The section, which is an extension of the Violet line that connects Faridbad to ITO, will make it easier for people to reach Delhi Gate, Daryaganj, Jama Masjid, Matia Mahal, Red Fort and parts of Chandni Chowk that are closer to Red Fort. Currently, commuters have to get down at   station for visiting these areas. After this section opens, the Walled City will get closer to business hubs of the city, such as Janpath.
 
 In March, DMRC had submitted the papers to CMRS as well as to the independent safety assessor for safety certification of the signalling systems.
 
 The Kashmere Gate station will become the first interchange facility of   to provide inter-connectivity between three corridors (Violet line with Red and Yellow lines).
 
 The length of the underground corridor between Central Secretariat and Kashmere Gate is 9.37km with seven stations — Janpath, Mandi House, ITO, Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate. The interchange stations on this line are Mandi House and Kashmere Gate. The Janpath-Mandi House section was opened on June 26, 2014 and the Mandi House-ITO section opened on June 8, 2015. 
 
 The   was given clearance by   on February 13, 2013.
