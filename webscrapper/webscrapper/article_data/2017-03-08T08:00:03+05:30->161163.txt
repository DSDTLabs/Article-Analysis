NOIDA: Residents of the city have asked the   Limited (DMRC) to reverse the non-refund policy on cash balance of  . They have urged reversal of the policy, which will be effective from April 1, in larger public interest.

 In a letter sent to DMRC managing director   on Tuesday, Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Associations (CONRWA) said it is inappropriate not to refund the credit balance in case of non-usage of a Metro smart card by a customer, as DMRC enjoys interest on deposits when the card is purchased. 
 
 The letter comes after DMRCâ€™s announcement to comply with RBI guidelines, which stipulate that customer have to use their cards within a defined time frame, failing which, the card will automatically get cancelled. 
 
 The RWA body maintained that while the reversal of the proposed decision will encourage more passengers to switchover to metro cards as there will be no fear of losing money, it will also help pave the way for cash less India.
