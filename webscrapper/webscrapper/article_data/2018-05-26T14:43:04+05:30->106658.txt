Health officials have now asked MC to issue challans to these shopkeepers. Meanwhile, officials also created awareness among the masses about the breeding of this mosquito, and measures to prevent the disease. 

 District epidemiologist Dr   — who was leading the team — said they checked coolers at various places and shops under the bus stand flyover, and caught larvae, which were destroyed on the spot. He said they had issued a warning to shopkeepers to keep their coolers clean, and at least once a week, they should empty water from the coolers and clean them properly.
 
 Meanwhile, health teams also checked the premises of Har Kishan Public School, Atam Jain Senior Secondary Public School, and Atam Vatika Public School. Health officials created an awareness regarding the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, and chikungunya among students and staff of schools, and even shopkeepers in the market.
 
 The teams told people that since dengue and chikungunya mosquitoes bite at day time, people should keep their body parts fully covered. Residents were told to use mosquito repellants at night time for their safety. People should not let water get accumulated in broken pots, drums, and tyres where mosquitoes breed.
