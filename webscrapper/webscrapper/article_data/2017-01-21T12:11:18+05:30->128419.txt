The process is time consuming,” Santosh Khetan, general secretary,   Small Industries Association (ASIA), said.
 
 The ASIA functionary added that over 100 companies have opened their bank accounts for their employees following the demonetisation move. “A small section of workers, who also earn their livelihood through the MNREGA scheme (when they are laid off for want of work order), have bank accounts opened in their name and companies are crediting salary to that account,” Khetan said. 
 
 Industry owner Saurabh Chaudhary said it will take a couple of months to adopt the digital mode completely. “Over 50,000 workers are employed in the (Adityapur) industrial area and only 20% of the said workforce is recognized on the record presently,” a senior HR official of a Tata Motors ancillary said. 
 
 Chief labour inspector AK Mishra informed that entrepreneurs have been asked to expedite the job of opening bank accounts of each of the stakeholder involved in the trade. 
 
 “Workers employed in Adityapur industrial area will receive their January salary in their bank accounts as the exercise is underway,” Mishra said. He added that the notification regarding the amendment to Payment of Wages Act, directing entrepreneurs to pay salaries also through bank cheques, will be issued in a week’s time.
