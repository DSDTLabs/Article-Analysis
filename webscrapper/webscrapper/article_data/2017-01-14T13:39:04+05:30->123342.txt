NEW DELHI: At least 30 supporters of Jallikattu were on Saturday taken into preventive custody in  's   for allegedly trying to defy a ban on the controversial bull-taming sport played during Pongal festival.

 According to the ANI report, the state police first lathicharged protestors who have been agitating against the ban in the Madurai's Avaniapuram area.
 
 Heavy police force was deployed since yesterday in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur, famous locations for jallikattu in Madurai District, as various organisations vowed to violate the ban and organise the sport.
 
 
  
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court had said it could not give its verdict on Jallikattu before Pongal even as political parties cutting across party lines had demanded from the Centre promulgation of an ordinance to allow the sport.
 
 Yesterday, in Karisalkulam village near Madurai, the sport was held in an open ground for a few minutes.
 
 In a symbolic protest, around five bulls were let into the ground by a group of youths, police had said, adding no arrests were made.
 
 DMK Working President   had led a protest in Chennai yesterday in this regard as he targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly not giving time for AIADMK MPs to discuss the Jallikattu issue.
 
 On Friday, some Jallikattu supporters briefly picketed locale of the shooting of Tamil film "Garjanai", starring Trisha, in Sivaganga district, angered by the actor's pro-PETA stand.
 
 However, Trisha, a known animal lover who has featured in PETA's advertisement for adopting homeless dogs, was not present there at that time.
 
 Police said all preventive steps have been taken to ensure maintenance of law and order and compliance of court's ban.
