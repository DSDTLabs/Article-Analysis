There’s nothing that gets pet parents excited more than showing off their pooches to others that appreciate them. The Happy Dog Carnival 2017 proved to be a forum that allowed people just that. The day had a host of different activities for not just the   but even the owners. There were things that both the pets and owners could do together and enjoy. Among them, there was the   run that spanned 2.5 kms, which saw good participation. And for those dogs that wanted to just chill with their pet parents, there was live music, carnival games, food truck and an exclusive dog flea market too.
 The   event for the day was the pet  , which saw these canines sport some really dandy haute couture and strut their best selves on the ramp like they were made to be in the spotlight. Many of the pet parents even wore clothes matching with their pets to up the fashion quotient on the ramp.
  The event also had a good cause attached to it, for each participant’s money would be used towards helping dogs in need by donating it towards rescue and adoption drives that are being conducted in the city.
