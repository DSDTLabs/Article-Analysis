MUMBAI: Had he been picked instead of   as India's second wicketkeeper-batsman for the  , after middle-order bat   was injured, it would've been icing on the cake in what has been a “dream season“ for  .

 Everything that Patel has touched this year has turned into gold, which culminated in the 32-year-old finishing as the top run-getter -395 runs in 16 games@24.68 (strike rate: 134. 81) for the  , who went on to clinch their third   title on Sunday at Hyderabad.
 
 The glittering IPL trophy seemed to be providing succour for the MI opener, who along with Jos Buttler and then Lendl Simmons, provided explosive starts to his team right through IPL-10.
 
 Summing up perhaps the most prolific phase of his career, the veteran `keeper-bat said: “Winning the   is something every player dreams about, especially playing for   and what we were 10-15 years back. That was brilliant. A Test comeback after eight years, it was always a dream for me to play one Test before I finish. I'm glad I could make a Test comeback. 
 
 “Winning the IPL is special. It's a long tournament. You have to make sure the team stays together for a long time and Rohit and the coaching staff did a fantastic job throughout the season. And, getting runs was important. Every time we had a good opening partnership, we always went on to make big runs. If we (MI) start well, it helps the bigger players like Rohit and Pollard to play freely. I'm happy to finish as the highest run-getter for MI but the most important thing was to win the trophy. I'm glad I am part of this (MI) set up,“ said the Gujarat stumper.
