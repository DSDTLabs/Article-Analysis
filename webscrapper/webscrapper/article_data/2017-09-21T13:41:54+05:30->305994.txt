NAGPUR: Additional sessions judge AC Raut on Wednesday granted interim anticipatory bail to Pandurang Pakhale and  , the two range forest officers (RFOs) against whom FIRs have been lodged at   police station by Pench tiger poaching case accused Devidas  .

 Kumre was arrested on June 26 with nearly 150 bones and teeth of tigers poached from inside the Pench Tiger Reserve. The RFOs are investigating officers in the poaching case. Kumre complained on September 11 that he was beaten and his ankle got fractured while in custody. 
 
 Kumre and other accused were released on bail on September 4 by a   court. The forest department has filed a cancellation of bail application. 
 
 On Wednesday, the RFOs moved the sessions court through lawyer Kartik Shukul and Abhilash Shriwas. Shukul argued that Kumre had filed a false complaint against the RFOs ostensibly to ensure that both land in trouble and the poaching case investigations came to a halt. 
 
 He argued that Kumre when produced earlier at the Ramtek court had told the magistrate that he has no complaints of ill treatment by the forest officers. Such statements were made on three separate occasions in open court and in the presence of his lawyer, according to Shukul. In the injury report in Central Jail, Kumre had stated that he had fallen while running away from forest officials.
 
 The matter has been kept for further hearing on September 27. The RFOs have been slapped Sections 326 and 506, which are non-bailable.
