MUMBAI: Two gangs that were allegedly involved in at least 34 house break-ins cases in the city were busted recently by the Mumbai police’s property cell. 

 The police said that they got a lead while scanning CCTV footages after break-in in south Mumbai and identified one of the accused—Gyanesh Shetty, a Makhurd resident. The police then laid a trap and arrested Shetty, who during interrogation disclosed the identities of two of his accomplices—Ravi Shetiyar and Pawan Verma. 
 
 Another burglar gang was arrested by a team of police including inspector Suil Mane. The gang of four would hire vehicles and target jewellery shops,” said a police officer.
