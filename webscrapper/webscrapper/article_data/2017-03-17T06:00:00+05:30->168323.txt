KOLKATA: Two linesmen were run over by a   on Thursday around 12.30pm, when they were checking tracks between Liluah station and Howrah carshed.

 According to cops, Ujjwal Maji (38) and Raju Baul (27) were at Bamangachhi, less than 200m from Liluah station, walking along the tracks that lead to platform No. 3 of Liluah station when the Bandel local travelling along the track leading to platform No. 2 sounded the horn from a very close distance. The duo, possibly startled, jumped from their track, landing in front of the oncoming train. 
 
 Railway officials said the   was not travelling at a high speed. “Both of them were senior linesmen. I don’t know how they could make the mistake of jumping in front of a train without realizing which track it was plying on. The GRP is conducting an inquiry and have recorded the statement of the driver,” said an   official.
 
 A railway lineman job is to periodically check the tracks for cracks.
