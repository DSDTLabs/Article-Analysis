AHMEDABAD: If you are planning to book a hotel room between January 10 and 13 in Ahmedabad, get ready to shell out five to six times the normal rate. The hotels are flooded with online requests from those attending the   and room rates are already going through the roof.

 Sample this, a hotel on the SG Road has been seeking Rs 6,500/night for March 10 to 13 bookings, but the rate is Rs 50,000/night for January 10 to 13 period. Similarly, a service apartment on SP Ring Road is available for only Rs8,000 in February next, but the rate is double for the Vibrant period. 
 
  A random check by TOI revealed that many hotels are quoting exorbitant tariffs — ranging from Rs15,000/night to Rs50,000/night (excluding taxes) — for a double-occupancy room for January 9-13 period as against Rs3,500 to Rs8,000 for March.

 “To meet the surge of demand we require 100%   to confirm room reservations and in case of cancellation, there is no provision of refund,” said an official of a leading hotel in the city. 
 
 This is not the first time that the city is witnessing such a situation in hotels during the Vibrant summit. During the earlier editions too, room prices had touched new high. 
 
 According to hospitality industry experts, Ahmedabad has total inventory of 4,500 rooms with 30 big hotels accounting for over 3,200 rooms.
 
 No help sought from builders this time
 
 The Gujarat government had in 2015 directed city builders to accommodate Vibrant guests in their unsold ready flats. “This year, the government is yet to issue any such directive to the builders. It seems, the government has adequate rooms for the delegates this time. Vibrant summit in 2015 was clubbed with Pravasi Bhartiya Divas celebrations and hence the number of guests was much more than what is estimated in 2017,” said an office-bearer of   (GIHED).
