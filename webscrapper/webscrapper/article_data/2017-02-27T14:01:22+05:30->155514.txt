 has always been someone to address the elephant in the room, so it did not come as a surprise when the actress was asked to give her opinion on nepotism in the industry, a topic recently brought up by   on Karan Johar’s chat show. 

 
 
 
 The much-popular talk show had Bollywood’s ‘Queen’ Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan on the couch when the ' ' actress brought up the topic of nepotism in Bollywood. Though she did not take any names, one wonders if she was possibly hinting at Alia Bhatt, Karan Johar’s favourite kid in Bollywood. 
 
 Alia Bhatt was asked for her take on the same, at a recent event. The actress stood her ground while saying, "I think a star kid can get that first film due to nepotism. But to constantly get films just because you belong to a filmi family, is not possible. I don’t want to take any names, but there have been many examples of sons and daughters of lineage who have come and gone without achieving anything. What about that? Eventually, people come to see you as an actor and not because your family is famous, and you can’t fool them." 
 
 She even went on to say how she has carved her own niche in the Indian film industry which has got nothing to do with her influential family background. "I am aware people do struggle to make a mark in the industry, but it’s not right to blame nepotism. I didn’t plan my birth in the Bhatt family. I can’t change that and today, I am successful not just because my family is famous, but also because I have worked hard and you can’t take it away from me."
 
 Alia Bhatt will soon be seen scorching the screen in ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’.
