PUNE: The arrest of Santosh Natu with firearms sourced from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh once again hinted at the link between criminal elements active in the city and the   dealers in the   heartland.

 Not long ago, a man from Madhya Pradesh was arrested for providing firearms to the assailants of property developer Deven Shah in the parking lot of his apartment, off Prabhat Road.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane told TOI, “Criminals visit Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procuring firearms at a cheap rate. Investigations in various firearms cases revealed that the firearms are brought to the city and sold to known persons at a higher rate. The firearms are also used for committing crime.”
 
 He said, “The crime branch and local police stations are constantly taking action against criminals involved in procuring firearms. Our teams had earlier visited the two states to trace the   of arms,” Dahane added.
 
 Senior inspector Sunil Pawar of Ahmednagar police, credited with busting an illegal firearms manufacturing unit at Madhya Pradesh during his tenure at the Pune crime branch, said, “A particular community manufactured firearms in Uttar and Madhya Pradesh during the days of rajas and maharajas. Their service was rendered by the Britons. They became jobless after the English quit India. They got in touch with agents as well as criminals and started selling them firearms at a cheap rate.”
 
 He said, “The local police stations there have been taking action against illegal procurement and sale of firearms but it is difficult to control the business because the community members operate at individual level at forests, home and isolated places.”
