The countdown for battle is on. ' ' versus ' ' is the first big clash of this year. And the makers of both the films are leaving no stone unturned to make sure that the film reaches the most. The first stage of this battle is the number of screens each film has managed to bag. Reports suggest that single screens have opted for the   starrer 'Raees' over the Hrithik starrer as the storyline of 'Raees' is more relatable with the single screen audience. 

 While single screens have titled their support towards 'Raees', the multiplexes across the country have opted for almost an equal release for both the films. That is if you see the ratio:
 
 
 55:45 in favour of Raees
 
 
  60:40 in favour of Raees
 
 The estimated screen count of 'Raees' is close to 2700 as compared to 2200 for 'Kaabil'.
 
 Both films will see each other at the box-office on 25th January, and the battle is surely the one to look out for.
