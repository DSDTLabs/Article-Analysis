The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) was constituted under the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act, 1966, Chapter 3A, Section 42. According to the notification, the   jurisdiction is over 843 villages from Haveli, Mulshi, Maval, Khed to Shirur, among others.

 The PMRDA is the planning authority and has to prepare a compensative development plan for the area. The 34 villages are a part of the PMRDA limits. Recently, the CEO of PMRDA declared the intension to prepare the comprehensive development plan (CDP) of the entire area.
 
 According to the present status, the issue of merging 34 villages in the PMC limits does not arise because PMRDA is a constitutional body and has to perform the functions under the 73rd and 74th amendment made to the Constitution of India in 1992.
 
 The preparation of CDP, publication, sanction, implementation thereof of the proposals to provide the basic civic amenities — water supply, drainage, road network and effective public transport — must be taken up by the PMRDA, a statutory body.
