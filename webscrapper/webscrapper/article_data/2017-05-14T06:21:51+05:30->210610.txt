PATNA: A Muslim woman on Saturday petitioned   Manu Maharaaj, seeking help for restitution of her   as her husband had married another girl.

 A wailing Shehnaaz (name changed) told the SSP at his ‘janata darbar’ that she met Sagar Kumar Gehlot a year back at S K Memorial Hall. Sagar is a constable with the dog squad of state CID, said the 20-year-old woman.
 
 “After year-long friendship, we married at a temple at PMCH on January 30 this year,” she said, adding when Sagar’s family got to know about the inter-faith marriage, they forced him to marry a girl of his community on May 9.
 
 “Sagar is not taking my phone calls,” said the girl, a second-year BA student of a college at Gulzarbagh. 
 
 The SSP told TOI investigation was on into the girl’s complaint. “The constable has been asked to appear for investigation,” he said.
