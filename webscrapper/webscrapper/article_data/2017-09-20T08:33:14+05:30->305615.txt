HYDERABAD: Upset with the submission made by   state counsel Krishna Prakash that the land acquisition officer misled him, the Hyderabad HC on Tuesday issued notice to D Goverdhan Rao, special deputy collector (Land Acquisition, Vamsadhara Irrigation Project, Srikakaulam), about the status of standing crops in four villages in Heeramandalam area.

 Bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice J Uma Devi was dealing with a public interest petition filed   vicepresident   who said that authorities were taking possession of farmers' fields filled with standing crops.
 
 According to the petitioner, the state had acquired the land for the project over five years ago but didn't take possession. In the meantime, farmers cultivated it, and if state wants to take over the land now, it should do so under the new land acquisition act.
 
 After a senior civil judge's report confirmed existence of crops, the bench directed authorities not to disturb crops till harvest. It asked farmers not to raise new crops hereafter. and posted the case to three weeks hence.
