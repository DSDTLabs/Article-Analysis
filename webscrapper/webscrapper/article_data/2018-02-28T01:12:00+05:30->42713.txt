MADURAI: Running staff – loco pilots and guards – under the aegis of the   ( ) staged a hunger strike at the western entry of Madurai Junction railway station on Tuesday, demanding the Indian Railways to scrap its plan of recruiting retired railway employees. Instead, they sought the filling up of existing vacancies in all categories with fresh recruitments. Around 90 running staff sat on a hunger strike while 60 more participated after their working hours.

 As per Southern Railway, Madurai division notification dated January 12, 2018 on re-engagement of retired employees, 583 posts are to be filled with retired employees in the division, in which huge chunk of 244 posts are of track maintainers, 65 ticket examiners, 99 technical staff for coach and wagon. The re-engagement is part of railways’ decision to redeploy retired staff across all divisions in the country. 
 
 SRMU has been protesting the decision on grounds that such move will deprive job opportunities to youngsters preparing themselves for railway employment. Further, the labour union questioned the logic behind redeploying retired staff in crucial safety category jobs like trackmen who have to walk for several kms to maintain the track. It will jeopardise the safety of passengers, the union said. 
 
 “We are protesting for the welfare of hundreds of youngsters aspiring for railway jobs and passengers depending on safe operation of trains. Redeploying retired staff will greatly relieve the pressure we are facing without adequate manpower, but it is not fair on railway ministry to deploy old staff in place of youngsters,” said assistant divisional secretary of SRMU, V Ramkumar.
 
 The hunger strike was inaugurated by divisional president of SRMU, G Ramasubbu, with local politicians and outfit leaders like G Thalapathy from DMK,   from   and S Vetrikumar from Naam Thamilar addressing the protesters.
