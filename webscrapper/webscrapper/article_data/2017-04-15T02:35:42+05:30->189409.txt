NAVI MUMBAI: A gang of 12 to 15 robbers came in a tempo, broke into an engineering unit in   on Thursday night after breaking the roof top. The gang loaded the tempo with materials like  , iron rods and pipes and even took away two cell phones of the workers.

 Some members of the gang pelted stones on the workers and injured a watchman. The Turbhe MIDC police did not register an FIR immediately and only accepted a complaint letter from the firm’s managing director. 
 
 “The policeman on duty told me that due to Ambedkar Jayanti all the cops were deployed for police bandobast and hence there was no police staff available to visit the factory and will send some one in the evening,” said Sudarshan Chandrashekhar, the complainant. 
 
 On Tuesday, two robbers had sneaked into the factory’s first floor through the window and tried to steal a worker’s mobile, Chandrashekhar said. “After the repeated incidents, my workers are fearing to work in the night shifts,” he said. Senior inspector Ramchandra Deshmukh said, “I will personally visit the factory and verify the incident.”
