CHARMINAR: It’s a double whammy commuters would very much like to avoid. Not just the scorching heat, lack of bus shelters in the Old City is driving passengers harried.

 But the RTC authorities do not appear to be unduly bothered about the fate of passengers. “Isn’t it the responsibility of   to set up shelters, especially during the summer? Buses are always running behind schedule and on top it, there are no shelters. Imagine the plight of the elderly, women and children on the road waiting for the buses,” said  , a commuter at  , told TOI.
 
 The bus terminal at Charminar was recently pulled down, causing a lot of inconvenience to commuters of Charminar, Shahalibanda and Miralam Mandi. “The apathy of the authorities towards citizens is deplorable. Neither we are provided proper sitting facility nor any shelter is built at the boarding point. Space on the road is narrow and passengers crowd the busy stretch where accidents are common,” said   at Shahalibanda bus stop.
 
 Commuters want the TSTRC authorities to address their problems immediately and provide basic facilities with heat beating down hard on them. “In fact, there are no bus shelters on several stretches in the Old City. With no shelters, the drivers even fail to stop at the alighting points. Errakunta, Chandrayangutta, Aliabad, Shamsheergunj, Lal Darwaza, Shahalibanda points urgently need bus shelters,”' said Ayesha Butool, a regular commuter.
