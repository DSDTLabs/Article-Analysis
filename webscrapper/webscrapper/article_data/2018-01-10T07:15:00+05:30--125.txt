Ludhiana: The three-day annual art exhibition organised at a city hotel near Ferozepur Road concluded on Monday. The exhibition featured art works created in different mediums. 

 Dr Sangeeta Lamba, who organised the event, said, “By organising such exhibitions, we get a chance to enhance students’ capability and display their creativity among the masses.”
 
 Radhika, an 18-year-old visitor at the exhibition said, “ I love the way artists have used various mediums to paint. From plastic crayons to water colours, artists have used oil, fabric and clay, among others. My favourite art work is in plastic crayons, which reminds me of my school days. The exhibition was a memorable experience and I aspire to display my work in the next exhibition.”
 
 Another academy member Pranav said, “the sole aim is to motivate the culture of art and appreciate the hidden artist in every individual. Successful execution of such events is just an additional victory for us. The theme of the exhibition was ‘Krishna’ and every painting gives a striking depiction of the theme.”
