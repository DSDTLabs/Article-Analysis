Allahabad: As the electoral race in the state hots up ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, in the three seats in   district –Chial, Manjhanpur and Sirathu– poll expectations might be caught up in a triangular contest between Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress-Samajwadi Party front and the Bahujan Samaj Party. 

 While BSP and SP-Congress front have started campaigning aggressively in the district, for BJP it is more of a ‘prestige issue’ as the district is also the home turf of the saffron party’s state chief Keshav Prasad Maurya. 
 
 The caste equations hold the key to victory in all three seats because of the large number of Dalits, OBCs and Brahmin voters in the three assembly constituencies. Of the three seats, Manjhanpur is a reserved seat. In the 2012 assembly elections, Keshav Prasad Maurya had won from the Sirathu. However, the seat was vacated after Maurya was elected as an MP from Phulpur. In the by-election, Vachaspati won from the seat on a SP ticket.
 
 A city-based political analyst said, “Dalit, Brahmin and Muslims hold the key in Manjhanpur and it has been a BSP stronghold for the last three assembly elections. In Chial, the Dalit, Brahmin and OBC voters are likely to be the game-changer.”
 
 BJP leader, Jitendra Sonkar said, “We are focusing on booth management to ensure a win in all three seats and BJP workers are organising a door-to-door campaign to gather support for the party.”
 
 While BSP leaders are confident of maintaing their stronghold over Manjhanpur, Chial and Sarthu, SP leader Daan Bahadur said the newly-forged SP-Congress alliance would create history in all the three constituencies by defeating its rival camps.
