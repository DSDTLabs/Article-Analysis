Panaji: The Goa police’s special investigation team (SIT) on Monday quizzed former chief minister and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and son-in-law, Govindraj Dempo, in connection with the alleged Rs 35,000 crore illegal mining case.  Speaking to TOI, crime branch superintendent of police Karthik Kashyap said that Dempo arrived at the SIT office at around 10.30am and was questioned for two hours. “We sought clarification from him in connection with the suspicious shell companies both in India and abroad with bank accounts linked to foreign banks,” Kashyap said.  Last week, the SIT questioned Kamat in the main illegal mining case. Kamat was confronted with facts revealed through the statements of Rajeev Yaduvanshi, former mines secretary and ex-mines department director.  He was also questioned on land acquisition from Bandekar Mines by the mines department rather than the PWD for a proposed jetty for Anil Counto which disregarded all precedents and rules, Kashyap had said. The SIT said that the same jetty was later used by many fly-by-night traders to export illegal iron ore.
