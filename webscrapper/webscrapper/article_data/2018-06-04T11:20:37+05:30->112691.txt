HYDERABAD: Telangana government will set up its own exclusive   across the state before 2019 elections. As many as 52 tests, including those for  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and scanning would be conducted free of cost. 

 
 However, these free tests would be applicable only for samples sent by primary health centres, community health centres and government hospitals located in the district. In the first phase, 20 diagnostic centres would be established in 20 districts. The cost of the project would be shared by National Health Mission. Each centre would be set up with initial investment of Rs 38 lakh and government has allocated nearly Rs 10 crore for the project. Each centre would be built in minimum of 2,400 square yards. 
 
 The centres are likely to be named Telangana Diagnostics. One such facility has already been set up at institute of preventive medicine in Hyderabad. The health authorities conducted a study which revealed that people from lower and middle income groups are unable to afford private diagnostic services. 
 
 Officials said though diagnostic services are available in tertiary hospitals in Hyderabad, these exclusive government-owned diagnostic services have been planned to extend free of cost services to the poor. "The government also plans to introduce CT scan facility in all these centres. The reports would be uploaded online for the patients to check and take out print outs. They can also collect it in person from the centres. The government's proposal is to send samples collected at PHCs to the centres by a professional agency that will be hired to carry them to the diagnostic hub," a source in medical and health department said.
