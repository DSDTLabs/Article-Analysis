KOLKATA: Kolkata Police has just got smarter to deal with those who step on the accelerator without keeping an eye on the speedometer.

 Cops have installed a roadside speed indicator on   that will read the speed at which a car is travelling and show it on a digital board put up 8 metres ahead. At present, it is being done on a trial basis with just one speedcam installed on the EM Bypass-bound flank of the flyover. According to senior officers at Lalbazar, more such indicators will be installed on key speed corridors, like EM Bypass and Red Road.
 
 The camera installed to measure the speed of car records date, time, location, image of the number plate, direction of travel, speed, the speed limit on that portion of the road and the lane in which the car is traveling.
 
 “For the time being, we are not going to start issuing fines on the basis of on the readings. They are being used mainly to caution the drivers. But we will start issuing traffic violation challans based on the readings in next few days,” said  , the deputy commissioner (traffic). Punishment can involve a fine of up to Rs 1,000 or a jail term of six months or both.
 
 “Measuring road traffic speed and displaying it — both are important issues. Most drivers are not aware how fast they are driving. Excessive speed often results in accidents on the flyover. The use of a preventive speed indicator device increases road safety,” said  , the additional commissioner (i) of Kolkata Police. 
 
 Goyal added the cops will procure 20 more cameras by the end of this month and are planning to install them at several speed corridors where speeding is a menace.
 
 Apart from installing a speedcam, cops have banned heavy vehicle on Maa flyover. For months, police had allowed only on-way traffic during the day. At present, traffic is allowed on both ways from the section where the ramp connecting   joins it. Bypass-bound vehicles are not allowed to take the flyover from Park Circus.
