KOLKATA: In a cowardly act, a group of heavily-armed insurgents, suspected of belonging to the banned   (PLA) struck a   (GREF) water bowser on Saturday and killed two unarmed labourers in the   of Manipur. The two labourers were locals, it has been confirmed.

 "The militants numbered between 10 and 15. The GREF men were working on the Imphal-Tiddim road. The incident happened around 8.35 am in the morning at Beheng near Border Pillar 41 along the Indo-Myammar border where both were working on a Border Roads project to provide connectivity to this remote area. They were returning after filling water bowser from a nearby nullah when the suspected PLA militants detonated three IEDs and then used Lathodes (single-shot grenade launchers) and automatic fire to kill the innocent workers. 
 
 An estimated 60-65 rounds were fired by the militants before they fled across the border," said Wg Cdr S S Birdi, CPRO, Ministry of Defence, Kolkata.
