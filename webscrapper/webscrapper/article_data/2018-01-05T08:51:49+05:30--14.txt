LUCKNOW: The number of cases of   (AES) and   (JE) in UP was the highest for 2017 over the past decade.

 Data from the health department has revealed that from 2008 to 2017, the maximum number of AES and JE cases came in the past year. Both diseases manifest in the form of brain fever.
 
 The highest number of JE deaths in UP was also recorded in 2017. In August, around 30 children affected by JE admitted at Gorakhpur’s   had died over shortage of oxygen supply.
 
 According to the heath department’s own analysis, AES is a disease of significant magnitude in the state. Though 38 districts are endemic for AES, the predominant disease and mortality burden is carried by seven districts of eastern UP, in   and Basti divisions.
 
 In 2017, there were 4,759 AES cases with 595 deaths.JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June, covering over 91 lakh children in the age group of 1-15 years.
 
 AES cases between 2006 and 2007 were recorded at 2,075 and 2,675 with deaths at 476 and 577 respectively.
 
 JE cases in 2006 and 2007 were 170 and 235 with 49 and 29 deaths respectively.
 
 On the spike in cases and deaths, director for communicable diseases and vectorborne diseases unit of the health department Dr   said, “The number of cases has increased, but the case fatality rate (CFR) has gone down in the past 10 years. This means that cases are being reported but fatality has decreased.”
 
 She added, “CFR in 2017 for AES cases was 12.5% and that for JE was 11.9%. This in 2016 was 16.3% for AES and 16.7% for JE.”
 
 Officials also reasoned that it was because of the awareness created around brain fever by ASHA workers on the ground that cases had increased. More people were aware that the fever affecting their child was AES or JE.
