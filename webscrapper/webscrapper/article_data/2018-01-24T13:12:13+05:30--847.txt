MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday ordered the commissioner of police of Madurai to arrest the managing director of   (TNSTC), Madurai division and produce him before the court on January 25 for failing to appear before it on Tuesday. A division bench headed by justice N Kirubakaran had already directed the TNSTC managing director and financial manager to appear before it on January 23. While the financial manager appeared, the MD failed to appear making the court to order his arrest.

 The transport corporation deducted money from the monetary benefits of its retired employees stating that there was a mess in settling the retirement benefits, due to which excess amount was given to the retired staff. Aggrieved by this, many people filed cases before the high court bench in 2014.
 
 The single judge, who heard the case passed an order in favour of the retired employees by directing the transport corporation to give the money deducted to the petitioners. Assailing the single judge order, the transport corporation preferred an appeal before the high court bench. The bench on March 27, 2014 dismissed the appeal. Despite it, the managing director of TNSTC (Madurai division) filed an appeal again. When it came up for hearing before the division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani recently, it directed the managing director and financial manager to appear before it on January 23.
 
 Accordingly, when the case came up for hearing, the financial manager alone appeared before the court, while the MD failed to appear. The bench said that in this particular case, it has already been decided. Being so, it was not proper for the transport corporation to approach the court again. The state is already reeling under a financial crisis. tnn
