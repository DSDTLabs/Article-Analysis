CHARMINAR: The busy   road, under  , has gradually turned into a dumping yard. The prevailing unhygienic condition and mosquito menace have made lives of residents and traders in the area miserable. The stench emanating from heaps of garbage strewn on the way to Ashoorkhana also irks many people.

 Residents and shopkeepers told TOI that the matter was brought to the notice of the   (GHMC) several times, but nothing has been done to improve the situation.
 
 “The problem has persisted for the last seven months. The pile of garbage on the busy route causes inconvenience to people passing by. Though garbage is lifted, the dumping yard has not been shifted permanently nor has any dustbin placed along the roadside,” complained, Salik, one of the shopkeepers.
 
 The residents say mosquito menace continues to rise in the locality since a month. They emphasized on the requirement of fogging in the area. “After sunset, mosquitoes menace haunts residents, despite efforts made to keep them at bay. Our children’s health is being affected mostly. There should be immediate fogging,” said Mohammed Hamid of the same locality. Residents urge the civic body officials to visit the area and clear the mess.
