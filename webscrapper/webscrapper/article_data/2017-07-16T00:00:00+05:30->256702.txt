The greatest investment you’ll ever make is in yourself. This applies to how you start your day. My day actually starts the night before. I write down what I want to get done the next day, and when I close my eyes to sleep, I work on the intention of being excited when I wake up. 

 I urge people to bring out the super hero in themselves. I meditate and visualise how I want to feel on each day, and when looking through my plan, I say an affirmation of “thank you” for the blessings given from the Creator. I write (poetry, journal, blog, or my novel), and then walk outside for at least a mile and pray and meditate.
 
 I have worked on this routine for a year now. The beautiful thing about staying true to a routine is it helps me to be more creative and productive. I get more done in those two hours than I do the whole day. My morning routine sets me up for success because it’s not about doing things without any thought. I wake up excited about the day ahead and pursue my life in an intentionally beautiful way.
