AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday pulled up the police for not registering an FIR on the basis of a complaint by a toll plaza employee in Gir-Somnath district, against   from Talala   and his son Sursinh, after a ruckus at a toll plaza last month.

 Cross complaints were filed with Prabhas Patan police station by Sursinh and the   manager, after a quarrel at the Dadri village toll booth. One of the toll booth employees, Urvish Solanki, was hospitalized after he sustained injuries.
 
 While police registered Sursinh’s complaint as an FIR, they remained silent on Solanki’s complaint. This led Solanki to approach the HC for registration of an FIR against Sursinh and the BJP MLA. The HC is likely to pass an order on his petition on Wednesday.
 
 Solanki has also filed a quashing petition against the FIR lodged by Sursinh. The HC issued notice to the state government and stayed police investigation.
