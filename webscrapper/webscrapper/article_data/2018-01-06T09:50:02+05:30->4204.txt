BENGALURU: The high court on Fridaysaid further proceedings of the seven-member expert committee constituted to look into the demand of minority status for Lingayats/Veerashaivas, will be subject to the result of two petitions pending before it.

 A division bench comprising acting chief justice H G Ramesh and Justice P S Dinesh Kumar, however, declined to pass any interim stay order in the matter.
 
 The court also ordered notices to the state and central governments, the national and state minorities’ panel and others. Noting that it requires detailed hearing, the bench posted the matter to January 18.
 
 According to the petitioners, neither the   which referred the matter to the expert committee nor the state government has any power to give minority tag to any religion or community.
 
 When the court posed a query regarding the difference between   and Veerashaivas, he replied that it is like referring to “India as Bharat”, implying that both are the same.
 
 Former advocate general Ashok Haranahalli, appearing on behalf of another petitioner, urged the court to grant an interim order saying that any publication of the decision in the interregnum would lead to unrest, apart from causing divisions in society.
 
 However, advocate general Madhusudan R Naik contended that no final decision has been taken by the committee, which he said was constituted to look into representations from people and to give its recommendations.
 
 The PIL was filed by  , a law student. His counsel argued that the CM has been making political speeches in various welfare programmes organized across the state from December 13, for which taxpayers’ money was spent.
