MUMBAI: It's rare to see batsmen not celebrate their milestones, but it was understandable why   was completely subdued when he reached his halfcentury at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday . The veteran opener cracked a fabulous 81 (51b, 12x4) to help   score a thumping eight-wicket win over South in the   . 

 The 35-year-old has scored as many as 45 fifties in this format, with many of them coming at a much bigger stage for the Kolkata Knight Riders and India. For a batsman who loves a scrap, this effort was a mere walk in the park.
 
 Chasing 174, the old firm of Gambhir and   (50, 38b, 6x4, 1x6) produced a vintage batting master class, matching each other stroke for stroke during their 103-run opening stand in 70 balls. Eyeing another comeback, both batsmen feasted on a mediocre attack on a batting beauty. 
 
 While Dhawan kept punching the ball through the off side, Gambhir drove imperiously , through the covers. When the South bowlers, particularly Vinay Kumar, made the mistake of pitching it short, Gambhir, with his cheston stance, found it easy to unleash the cut and the pull. It was vintage stuff from the Delhite.
 
 Once Dhawan exited after being stumped off Murugan Ashwin,   showed why he's being hailed as the latest sensation in India cricket, as the 19-year-old celebrated his recent elevation to Delhi captaincy with a 19ball, unbeaten 33, which included three huge sixes and a four-the last of which finished off the match.
 
 Earlier, leading the North Zone team, veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh gave himself and Parvez Rasool just two overs each, preferring instead to give the full quota of four overs to the third spinner in the XI, Himachal's Mayank Dagar.
 
 Justifying Harbhajan's faith, the left-arm spinner dismissed both the   openers.
