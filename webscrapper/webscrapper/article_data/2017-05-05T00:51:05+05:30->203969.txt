NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday asked   to be well prepared before approaching the  .

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra said that in a clutch of petitions raising public interest issues, the petitioners failed to give proper assistance.
 
 “People can’t just go out on the street, pick a cause and file a PIL. Please support your petition with facts, the fact finding should be complete,” the bench observed when a woman lawyer claimed severe shortage of CATS ambulances in the capital. When the court asked her to furnish figures, including number of ambulances and patients declined by CATS, the lawyer was at a loss for a reply, prompting the court to emphasise the need for well researched petitions.
 
 “Petition should have study showing what was not done and disclose what can be done. You just go out and find few examples of inaction and file a PIL. Just imagine how demoralising it must be for the government when they have actually done something in a certain area, but a PIL claims nothing done, without research?” the bench said, reprimanding the lawyer for coming ill prepared.
 
 The court also asked her to first find out exact number of ambulances available and ratio of patients so that a figure could be given of required number of vehicles.
 
 In a related matter filed by the same petitioner, high court again noted that the plea alleged people faced a lot of problems in getting births and deaths registered since they were forced to shuttle between hospitals and corporations.
 
 While the court acknowledged there may be stray problems and even sought a reply from the   and the corporations, it informed the petitioner that most of the certificate related information has been digitised and the corporations routinely send the certificates to authorised hospitals to hand it to those in need.
