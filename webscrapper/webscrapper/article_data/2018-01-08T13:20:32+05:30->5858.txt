RANCHI: Even as the   chief   and his battery of advocates are eager to find some breathing space by moving an appeal and a bail petition at the earliest possibile, things are not going to be easy. The special   court's judgement on the quantum of punishment came on Saturday evening and it was not possible for the counsels of the former   chief minister to obtain certified copies of judgment immediately. 

 Lalu's counsel in Ranchi, Prabhat  , said: "We will apply for the certified copies on Monday and after obtaining it, we will go through the papers minutely before preparing the appeal seeking to quash the subordinate court order as well as for filing the bail petition."
 
 "Conventionally, for sentences of five years of lesser, courts generally grant bail but in case of   and the kind of arguments forwarded by CBI, nothing can be said with surety," Kumar said, adding that they have faith on judiciary and would like to be well prepared than committing errors while being hasty.
