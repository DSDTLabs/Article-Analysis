NAGPUR: While over ten candidates are contesting from some seats of the city, in seat 36B the two candidates have to contend with only each other. This is the only seat which is witnessing a real straight fight in   (NMC) election. Both Rekha Barahate (Cong) and Pallavi Shamkule (BJP) are sitting corporators albeit from neighbouring wards.

 Six candidates had filed their nominations from this seat. Other Barahate and Shamkule, Usha Chaudhari (NCP), Veena Khanorkar (Ind), Rajashree Pannase (Ind) and Nanda Wanjari (Ind) had filed their nominations. They were persuaded either by Congress or BJP leaders to withdraw from the fray.
 
 Interestingly both Barahate and Shamkule are not very sure who would benefit from removal of other candidates from the scene. Shamkule said that only time would tell who would benefit from it. “I will win because of the work done in last five years. Some 23 out of 32 booths of my old ward Khamla are part of the new ward 36. I have full faith on my performance,” she told TOI.
 
 Barahate said that the withdrawals might benefit her. “I will win because of the work done by me. I have done a lot in social field and given special attention to women. As a corporator I had good public contact. About 40% of my old ward is part of the new one and hence the voters know me,” she added.
 
 In 2012 too, only one seat had witnessed a straight fight — between Prashant Dhawad of Congress and   of  . Dhawad had easily defeated his rival.
