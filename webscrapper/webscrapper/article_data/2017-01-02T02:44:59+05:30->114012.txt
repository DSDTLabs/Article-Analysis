AHMEDABAD: Cyber cell of the Gujarat crime branch has received call details from US-based voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) service providers to aid its investigation in the call centre scam case.

 The documents reveal that 4.5 lakh US cell numbers were contacted by callers from just one call centre,  , operating from an office complex in Bodakdev. The call centre was operated by Sandeep Dhavda and Hitendra Rajvani in partnership with   “If numbers of US citizens contacted by one centre is anything to go by, the total number of American citizens contacted by several call centres could run into crores. It is estimated that of 100 calls made, 20% fall prey to the fraudsters. If we go by this estimate, 80,000 US citizens could have been cheated by just this one call centre,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch officials said that cell numbers provided by US based VoIP service providers match with cell numbers in spreadsheets recovered from computers of the accused at Lac Art El Infotech. The operators used to call US nationals and posed as   (IRS) officials to defraud them. Five Gujarat-based call centres have been indicted in the US for a multi-million dollar   cheating scam so far.
 
 Cyber cell officials said they have identified 25 victims of thousands, as it is difficult to contact each potential victim. “We will write to the   (FBI) to contact them for the recording evidence,” said a senior cyber cell official.
