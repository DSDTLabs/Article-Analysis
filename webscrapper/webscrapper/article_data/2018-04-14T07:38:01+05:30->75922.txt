MANALI: A 30-year-old tourist from Delhi, who had come here with his friends for trekking, has been missing from near   in Manali since Tuesday afternoon. A month ago, a 23-year-old tourist from Delhi disappeared from   village in Kullu district.

 Akhil Chadha and his 12 friends had left for Hamta circle on Sunday. They were accompanied by a guide, a cook and a helper. After spending the second night at Sara-baggi, Akhil got separated from his group in the forest area somewhere above Jagatsukh and Shuru villages.

 “We are still searching for him with the help of police and local people. It is snowing here. The last time we saw him, he was wearing brown trekking boots, a black shirt, a light grey jacket, grey trousers, black sunglasses. He was carrying a trekking stick and a leopard print small bag. He is fair and around 5 ft 7 inches tall. We are confident that he is safe,” said one of his friends.
