SRINAGAR: Addressing concerns that adoption of   will “dilute” the autonomy of   & Kashmir, finance minister Arun   said the state’s revenues and common people stand to benefit substantially from the tax reform. “Anyone suggesting that the GST should not be implemented here, is not keeping the interests of the state and the common people in mind. Not implementing GST means making goods more costly,” Jaitley said.

 The finance minister said the state is free to alter its laws to make its taxation system compliant with GST. “J&K is not a producing state, it is a consuming state. Its revenues will rise with the implementation of GST,” he said. 
 
 Jaitley, said the situation in the state was more normal than was often reported in the media. “The finance ministers of so many states are here and have enjoyed the hospitality of the state government,” he said.
