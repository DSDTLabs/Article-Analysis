KOLKATA: On a day a local court rejected the bail plea of the six accused who had gone to Sugata Bose’s residence with an extortion demand and threatened his mother Krishna, Lalbazar sources said the cops would examine some people considered to be close to a local councillor.

 According to sources, this will help the police ascertain if the accused were instructed by any local leaders to collect extortion money from the Boses.
 
 The cops said they are likely to record the statement of Bharat Jana, the local   president – a wing of the   Congress. A close aide of a councillor, Jana has of late been trying to flaunt his proximity to an MP. His father Narayan Jana though said the police never contacted them. “We have done nothing wrong and hence have nothing to fear,” said Narayan.
 
 “We need to know the larger conspiracy. Even on Thursday, we told the court that the accused had committed a grave crime, but claimed to us that they had gone to collect dues from the MP. The victims had never seen them before,” said an officer. The court has sent all the accused to judicial custody till July 12.
 
 The general modus operandi adopted by the Pyarabagan syndicate in the past six months is modelled on New Alipore which earned its notoriety several years back. “It started with helping the unemployed and create a loyal gang. Next, the local clubs were roped in. What followed was extortions and a gang would look for easy and soft targets – usually the retired salaried middle class,” said another investigator.
