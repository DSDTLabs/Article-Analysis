BEHRAMPORE: An outburst against his own party colleague by  's former MLA Imani Biswas queered the party's district meeting at   on Wednesday. 

 Regarding minister Jakir Hossein, Biswas said Trinamool's main enemy in   is the party itself. Hossein was not present at the meeting.
 
 "There is no denying BJP has increased its influence all over the country. But in Murshidabad the BJP can't take on Trinamool without our own men. A section of Trinamool leaders is giving oxygen to CPM and Congress by heckling our own party leaders," Biswas added. The outburst shows how uneasy the party is even after it wrested control of all the municipalities and zilla parishads in Murshidabad from Congress and Left Front.
 
 Beldanga Municipality chairman Bharat Jhawar added fuel to the fire. "It seems our party thrives on tenders," he said. Jhawar admitted the "cold war" between the new Trinamool made up of men from Congress and CPM and old one comprising of the party's old guards.
