NASHIK: Farmers from Shivde, who are opposing joint   for  , continued to stall the process for the   on Saturday, demanding a dialogue with the district collector.

 Farmers in Nashik district have refused to give their land for the state government’s ambitious Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Super Highway.
 
 “The farmers, who had turned violent on Friday, heard the administration peacefully throughout Saturday and then held a meeting among themselves. They then presented a memorandum to the officers, setting a few conditions and calling for a meeting with district collector Radhakrishnan B before the joint measurement is done,” said deputy collector  , who is also administrator, new townships,  .
 
 In the memorandum, the farmers have demanded Rs 2.50 crore per acre and payment of entire amount before the government starts land acquisition. “We do not want the price set by the government as it has been fixed arbitrarily. We want the price for the land as we demand. The prices of the land across the stretch of the highways cannot be uniform,” the farmers said.
 
 The farmers have also stressed on the settling of all the farm loans and that the same should not affect the compensation given to the farmers. “If a farmer has taken loan on the land, it has to be cleared by the government and the compensation for the land acquisition should be paid in full to the farmer irrespective of the amount of loan,” the farmers demand.
 
 The farmers have stressed for a dialogue with the collector before the beginning of the joint measurement. “We are unable to carry out the joint measurement of other areas. We will have to settle the issues first. Soon, a meeting of the farmers and the collector will be conducted to decide on the issue,” the officer said.
