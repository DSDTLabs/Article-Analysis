NASHIK: Bowing to  , the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation is set to introduce a new   from   to Kasara within a week. 

 Commuters who get off at Nashik Road and want to board the Mumbai local trains at Kasara will benefit from the new service. The demand for introduction of such service was huge and MSRTC has decided to cash in on it.
 
 “MSRTC has over a period of one month launched buses from taluka headquarters and depots to Kasara railway station to help people, who wish to travel by local trains to and from Mumbai. The experiment has been successful and yielding results,”  , division controller, Nashik, said.
 
 Large number of people who travel to Mumbai prefer the local trains from Kasara for better and faster entry into the city at a fair ticket price. This is the reason that MSRTC has not been able to run good number of buses on the route as compared to the Nashik-Pune route. Besides, there are large number of trains that pass through Nashik and are used by passengers to travel to and from Mumbai.
 
 “Often people from the various parts of the district come to Mahamarg stand to catch the bus or take the private vehicles from Mahamarg to Kasara. The return journey is the same. Now, we have a direct link from our taluka or depots to Kasara and return,”  , resident of Dindori taluka and self-employed IT professional, said.
