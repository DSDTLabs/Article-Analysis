BENGALURU: The high court on Tuesday expressed fears that if suitable steps are not taken with regard to sites where garbage is being dumped, Bengaluru and its neighbourhood may see a repeat of the Bhopal gas tragedy.

 “We may have another Bhopal gas tragedy here or another Bellandur. That ( ) was from an industry and this will be from waste. It happened with water in Bellandur, but this will be in the air. People may die in hundreds if such gases emanate. How will you control breathing?” Justice B V Nagarathna, who is part of the special division bench which is hearing Bengaluru’s garbage mess-related petitions, questioned the  .
 
 The judge’s observation came after the expert members told the court that methane gas flare-ups were being noticed at some places, including quarry pits where garbage is being dumped.
 
 Solid waste management expert Almitra Patel brought to the notice of the court the threat of methane gas leaking from waste.
 
 ‘Make plants functional’
 
 The court also directed the BBMP to make fully functional the seven municipal waste processing units already commissioned in Kannahalli, Seegehalli, Doddabidarakallu, Chikkanagamangala, Subbarayanapalya, KCDC at Koodlu and Lingadeeranahalli. 
 
 The petitioners had complained that many of these plants are dysfunctional and some are not functioning fully and Rs 350 crore spent on them is going waste.
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, solid waste management, promised action to make these plants functional. 
 
 BBMP pays Rs 50,000 penalty 
 
 The court directed the BBMP to furnish details of the ward committees which have not held meetings and also their conveners by Friday. 
 
 The BBMP submitted a cheque for Rs 50,000 to the court towards the cost imposed on it in a February 23 order for failing to comply with various directions, including conducting ward committee meetings and also identifying sites for disposal of waste within individual wards.
