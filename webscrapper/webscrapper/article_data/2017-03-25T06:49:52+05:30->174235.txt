LUDHIANA: Taking a leaf from finance minister Manpreet Badal’s book, who drove a beacon-less car and caught a cop taking bribe, DIG (Ludhiana range)   on Friday called a meeting with SSP (Ludhiana rural) Surjit Singh, Nawanshahr SSP Naveen Singla and   and asked them to use the same method for checking in their respective areas.

 On Thursday,   had caught a traffic cop, who was later identified as head constable Jagjit Singh from Khanna police, taking bribe near Gurthali bridge of Sidhwan canal. The minister also captured the entire sequence on his phone and forwarded it to Ludhiana police commissioner Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Taking immediate action, the Khanna SSP had suspended Jagjit Singh and another head constable Manjit Singh, who was accompanying him.
 
 The video made by the minister has also gone viral on social media, with residents appreciating Badal for not using beacon on his car as it helped him capture corrupt cops.
 
 DIG Kalia said, “The finance minister was driving his car without beacon and so he managed to catch two traffic cops while they were taking bribe. This idea can be quite helpful. So on Friday, the officials were asked to regularly take a round of their areas in their private cars.”
