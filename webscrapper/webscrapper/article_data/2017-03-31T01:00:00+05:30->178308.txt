 The album, referred to by Drake as a playlist, is literally that — 22 songs crafted by the artiste that are spread across several genres like, dance-hall, grime, trap, Afrobeat and pop, still it’s not all over the place. Drake has borrowed a leaf out of his pal Kanye West’s book when it comes to experimenting, and safe to say, the results are more than satisfactory.
 And this album is personal; probably his most personal one till date. While a lot of his previous material deals with a common theme of the artiste’s break-ups and misdemeanors, here he takes a wider look at his life. In the very first song, 'Free Smoke', he starts by dropping Jennifer Lopez’s name, revealing details about their relationships. Then, 'Fake Love' has all the makings of a hit where the rapper talks about feuds with other artistes he has had all of last year and addresses him releasing ‘diss’ tracks. 'Get It Together' is a groovy, house-influenced track where he collaborates with singer Jorja Smith. Another interesting collaboration is 'Glow', where Kanye comes in and the two together create a song that is catchy, breezy and perfect to chill out to. 'Passionfruit', a stand-out track in the album, with its dancehall vibe and its slow beats, is a clear winner. For fans of Drake, this is 82 minutes of pure fun where the low-key tracks are bigger bangers than the loud ones.
