Panaji: The crime branch of Goa police, which is investigating the murder of social activist   Dias, has approached the district and session court, Panaji, to seek permission for a polygraph (lie-detection) test on the two boys who were the last to see him alive.

 Investigating officer PI Vishwesh Karpe told TOI they are waiting for the court to decide on their application. He also said that after registering the murder case they have recorded the statements of over 20 witnesses and more are likely to be recorded. 
 
 The crime branch had earlier sought the court’s permission, but it was rejected on the grounds that one of the boys was a minor while the other was mentally challenged.
 
 In April 2017, the crime branch had registered Dias’death as a murder on high court directives. It had also filed a status report before the high court in the case. Every three months, police is required to file a status report before the court about the investigation.
 
 On November 6, 2015, Bismarque went missing after a swim at night along with two boys from St Estevam. The next day, his body was found floating in River Mandovi near Cupa at St Estevam. Dias was last seen at the Babal sluice gate, a water body on the north-eastern part of St Estevam, along the river.
 
 Police had claimed the death was due to  , but Bismarque’s friends, family and some social activists had refused to accept this version. They alleged that the Old Goa police did not carry out a proper investigation and that the case be transferred to the crime branch.
 
 Following the direction of then chief minister, Laxmikant Parsekar, the case was transferred to the crime branch, which concluded that there was no foul play, and the death was due to drowning. Subsequently, the case was closed.
 
 Later, friends of Dias approached the high court seeking direction to the Goa police to register the case as murder.
