MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Friday made all managing committee members of the   a party to a petition that has questioned the launch of the   and sought an affidavit in reply from the association.

 
 A bench of Justices Shantanu Kemkar and Makarand Karnik wants the   to explain if the launch of the league in Mumbai ensures compliance with the Lodha Committee recommendations as accepted by the Supreme Court. The HC also wants to know from the association if any financial irregularities exist as alleged by an MCA member  .
 
 The HC was hearing a petition filed by Memon, a former Wankhede curator which wants the HC to “appoint a committee of administrators (COA) preferably headed by a retired judge,” to run the activities of the association by superseding its managing committee. The petition questioned as ‘hasty’ an allotment of tender to conduct the T20 league to a special purpose vehicle Probablity Sports India Pvt. Ltd which was created by Wizcraft International Entertainment Pvt Ltd and India Infoline Ltd.
 
 It makes cricket’s apex body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and other managing committee members whose terms ended also parties to the petition. The HC issued notices to all the managing committee members too.
 
 Memon’s counsel Mihir Desai submitted that MCA be directed to implement the Lodha Committee recommendations as ordered by the Supreme Court. He pointed out that other high courts like Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir have already appointed administrators for their local cricket associations and sought similar relief here too. He submitted that the bids caused a “loss’’ to MCA which is to get only Rs 3 crore annually while the chunk of profits would be netted by the SPV.
 
 Memon’s demand received strong support from BCCI in court. Counsel for BCCI, Virag Tulzapurkar, also said that an administrator be appointed for MCA. He also said that for a year-and-a-half, MCA did precious little to bring in Lodha reforms.
