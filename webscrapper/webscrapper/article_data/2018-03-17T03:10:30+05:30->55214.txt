NEW DELHI: The Centre filed an affidavit in the   on Friday saying it had abandoned the alignment that would have involved dredging   or Adam’s Bridge for the   (SSCP). Eleven years ago, the SC had stayed dredging following an intervention by   leader  .

 The shipping ministry told the SC it stood by the   government’s affidavits filed in February and September 2013 conveying the decision to pursue the Sethusamudram project, but “considering the socio-economic disadvantages of Alignment No. 6 (that required dredging of Ram Sethu), the government of India does not want to implement the said alignment.” The project will help ships reach Chennai from Colombo without having to circumnavigate the entire island nation.
 
 “The Centre intends to explore the alternative to the earlier alignment of Sethusamudram project without affecting/damaging Adam’s Bridge/Ram Sethu in the interest of the nation. The SC may dispose of the petitions accordingly,” additional solicitor general Pinky Anand told a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra.
