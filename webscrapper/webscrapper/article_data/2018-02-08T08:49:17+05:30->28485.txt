HYDERABAD: Less than a week after Hyderabad high court took up a letter from 11 child brides as a public interest litigation, a round table meeting will be held on Thursday by city-based child rights  ,  , along with legislators, legal experts, social activists, psychiatrists and gynecologists seeking constitutional amendment of minimum marriage age of girls from 18 to 21, so that girls can complete graduation.

 “A girl is intellectually mature by the age of 18, however, they are not emotionally mature enough to start a big responsibility like marriage. Many studies have shown that marriages of girls above 21are more successful than those of girls aged18-19 years, who are likely to be more impulsive than mature, as they are not emotionally ready for a relationship like marriage,” said Dr  , city based psychiatrist and a panelist at the meeting.
 
 “The girl getting married at 17-18, has hardly any idea about the person she is marrying. Not just her health, her education is important also. A woman’s financial independence is equally important as her husband’s, or any boy’s,” said  , president of Balala Hakkula Sangham.
 
 Several health issues have been identified during and after the pregnancy of 18 to 19 year old girls as well.
 
 “For the past 25 years, I have been handling such cases of early pregnancy. The right age of pregnancy is 21-25 years. It affects the mother and the child,” said Dr  , a city based gynecologist, adding that babies suffer from iron and protein deficiencies and and are underweight and malnourished. Girls who get pregnant at a very early age suffer from severe back pain, vomiting and digestive problems.
 
 “The girls would not be mentally ready for the pregnancy or marriage, so these kind of issue and pain, not only affect them physically but also mentally,” she said.
