SRINAGAR:   Dar alias Billa, 18, of Laharwarpora in   district was on cloud nine on Sunday when PM   mentioned his name in ‘Mann Ki Baat’.

 Bilal was 14 when he started earning his living by picking waste from   lake in the district in 2013, earning Rs 150-200 per day which helped him support his mother and two sisters.
 
 Srinagar Municipal commissioner Shafkat Khan said Bilal collects over 12,000kg of trash annually from the lake. A documentary by Kashmiri filmmaker Jalal-u-Din Baba cast light on Dar’s life. “I used to take somebody’s boat in the wee hours and collect waste from the lake,” Dar told TOI.
 
 “Now, we’ve appointed Dar as a brand ambassador of Srinagar Municipal Corporation. He will be given a special uniform and a vehicle to meet people and sensitise them about enviromental issues,” Khan said. Bilal said, “I’m very happy that my work was acknowledged by no less than the PM.
