AMRITSAR: Sikh seminary   chief   has announced to extend support to the candidates backed by   (SAD) contesting the elections of Chief  . Talking to TOI, Dhumma said, "I have appealed to the CKD members to vote for Rajmohinder Singh Majitha, Nirmal Singh Thekedar and Surinder Singh who are contesting for the posts of president, vice-president and secretary respectively." 

 The CKD elections for the three posts are slated for March 25. With Damdami Taksal, owing allegiance to the SAD, coming openly in support of candidates in fray for the CKD polls, it is believed many other Sikh bodies could make an announcement of their support to the Majitha group.
 
 According to information, candidates loyal to the Congress are not getting support from the party owing to some 'compromise' allegedly made with the Akalis. They are using their influence to woo the CKD members to vote for Majitha.
 
 One CKD member, who didn't want to be identified, said, "Today a senior Congress leader of Amritsar called me to vote in favour of Majitha." The RSS and the BJP are also reportedly keeping an eye on the day-to-day developments and progress in the CKD polls. "Three days ago, Amritsar-based former MLA of the BJP held a meeting on the instruction of a senior party in Delhi to garner support for the SAD-backed candidate," said sources. However, CKD member advocate  , aligned to officiating president Dhanraj Singh's group, said, "The Damdami Taksal or the Congress party's support to any candidate can't influence our vote bank. We have shown work in few days' time and have given major relief to the parents of student studying in the schools run by the CKD."
