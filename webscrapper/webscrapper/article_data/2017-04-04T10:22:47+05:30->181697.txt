HYDERABAD: Union information and broadcasting minister M   said on Monday that the media in the country is working in a free and fair environment and enjoys complete freedom to criticise anyone in the government, including Prime Minister  . Denying the allegations made by Congress leader and former finance minister   that there was a 'systematic infringed control over the media,' the minister described the criticism as 'baseless and absurd'. 

 "Some sections of the media carried stories about who will succeed Narendra Modi if he dies now. Some have termed the PM as ' '. If there was no freedom for the media, how are these comments appearing?" asked the minister at a media conference convened by him. Coming down heavily on the remarks of Chidambaram, Venkaiah reminded everyone as to what the Congress had done in the past, like imposing emergency, amending the constitution after jailing the Opposition and imposing censorship in the country. "We welcome dissent but do not support disintegration. We welcome disapproval but not destruction. We respect different opinions but oppose divisive politics." 
 
 He announced that the BJP has become a truly 'national party and a nationalist party' in the country with 352 MPs and 1385 MLAs and governments in 15 states. "We now control 69 per cent of area and 59 per cent of population of the country. In the states where elections were recently held for 690 seats, the BJP won 406 seats while our allies bagged 13. The country has given a fresh mandate to the Narendra Modi-led NDA government," said Venkaiah Naidu.
 
 Making his stand clear on the defection of MLAs and MPs, Venkaiah said, "In Karnataka, some MLAs joined the BJP and we got them re-elected by the people."
