CHANDIGARH: With the   high command being briefed about the alleged ‘inadequate’ representation of the Dalits during the recent cabinet expansion, the party may soon make up for it while appointing heads of boards and corporations in the state.

 Disgruntled party MLA  , who had resigned from party positions after the announcement of the cabinet expansion, said he had met with senior Congress leaders Ashok Gehlot and Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday and briefed them about the ‘grouse’ of the SC/BC communities in the state.
 
 According to information, technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi later escorted Gilzian and deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti to meet party president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday. Priyanka Gandhi was also present in the meeting.
 
 “The meeting with Rahulji and Priyankaji was a follow up to our meeting with the two senior party leaders. We have given our feedback and I’m sure the party will resolve the anomaly,” he said.
 
 However, when asked if he would be willing to take on the responsibility of a board or a corporation, Gilzian said his supporters wanted Dalits to have a representation in the cabinet expansion but if that hasn’t happened; he would rather work with the people on the ground.
 
 Earlier, another   leader Raj Kumar Verka had briefed Rahul about the issue last week.
 
 Meanwhile, the decision of the Dalit leaders from the state directly approaching the party high command has raised many brows in the state leadership. “Channi was there to raise the issues of the Dalit community ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and cabinet expansion was one of them,” said a party leader.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Channi could not be contacted for comments.
