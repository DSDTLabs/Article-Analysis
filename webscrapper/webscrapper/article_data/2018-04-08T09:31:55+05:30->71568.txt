CHENNAI: At least 15  , including four four-wheelers   in connection with various criminal cases and parked behind the office of the   deputy superintendent of police, went up in flames on Friday. No one was injured. The cause of fire is yet to be ascertained.

 A fire and rescue team stationed at the Guduvancherry bus terminus in view of governor Banwarilal Purohitâ€™s visit to Chengalpet Medical College for the convocation on Friday rushed to the spot and put out the fire that raged for half-an-hour. Firefighters said the dry leaves added intensity to the fire. As thick smoke rose, people rushed to the place. Many were seen taking selfies against the backdrop of the fire. The police had dumped more than 100 bikes and 10 four-wheelers at the place.
 
 In an earlier incident, on February 22, a fire accident damaged several vehicles parked behind the office. The police are investigating if anyone had set fire to the vehicles.
