MUMBAI:   president   and former chief minister   on Wednesday called misleading the claim by CM   that the state was looking at a possible investment of Rs 14 lakh crore from the recently concluded three-day   conference.

 “It’s an eyewash,” Prithviraj Chavan said. “If Fadnavis is serious about the possible investments, he must place all information in the public domain, preferably on the government website.”
 
 Even during the Make In India conference organised two years ago, Fadnavis had made claims that did not go on to match reality. He had announced investments of Rs 8 lakh crore, 14,000 MoUs and jobs for 30 lakh people.
 
 Official data showed investments did not exceed Rs 6,000 crore and fewer than 838 MoUs were realised, while job generation was under 42,000.
 
 “I had sought information under RTI on the status of a controversial firm, Foxconn, but it was denied on grounds of confidentiality,” Prithviraj Chavan said. “It’s unfortunate; the chief minister can’t hide crucial information from the people.”
 
 Ashok Chavan said that it was not a Magnetic Maharashtra conclave but a “Pathetic Maharashtra” event.
 
 “In the last three and half years, Fadnavis has given misleading information on investment proposals and employment generation,” he said. “If he is serious, Fadnavis must come out with a white paper on investments.”
 
 He said efforts were made to undermine the importance of the city by PM   and Fadnavis was a silent spectator.
 
 “We have lost the International Finance Services Centre to Gujarat, the bullet train is imposed on us and several key projects have been shifted to Gujarat,” he said.
 
 He said crores were spent on Magnetic Maharashtra but there was no seriousness in tackling the agrarian crisis and halting farmer suicides.
