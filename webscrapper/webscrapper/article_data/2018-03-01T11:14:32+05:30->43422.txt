COIMBATORE: Thirty-six libraries were scheduled to be opened in as many rural police stations in the district on January 14, 2018. While inspector general of police (west zone) A   is yet to give green signal to open the libraries, it didn’t take him long to remove the controversial novel One Part Woman written by   from the list of books to be kept there. 
 
 District superintendent of police   had one-and-a-half months ago announced the plans to set up libraries in 36 rural police stations to inculcate reading habits among the police personnel. Each library was to get 50 books related to various laws and another 50 (moral) story and current affairs books. 
  
 The police subsequently got sponsorship for supplying books. The sponsors bought 100 books and sent the list to senior police officials, who forwarded the same to Pari for verification. In addition to One Part Woman, the inspector general of police ( ) has also removed another book written by Perumal Murugan from the list. 
  
 “The libraries will feature books written by   officer Irai Anbu, ADGP C Sylendrababu, Trichy police commissioner A Amalraj and former Indain President  . Story books, general knowledge books, dictionaries and English grammar books will also be kept in these libraries. We have, however, removed two controversial books from the list,” said a police source. 
  
 The source also hinted at the plans to open libraries at the office of the special branch, SP camp office, district crime records bureau and district armed reserve police office. “We have sought permission from the IGP to open another four libraries. But we are yet to hear from him,” the source added. 
  
 The reason for the delay in opening the libraries is not known. Also, officials didn’t say when these libraries would be opened.
