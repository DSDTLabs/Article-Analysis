SRINAGAR: In a major boost to its morale, the   that had been lately taking a hit in Kashmir, killed at least 10 heavily armed terrorists, including two intruders of a Pakistani   (BAT), and recovered ammunition of the quantity of “war-like stores” in the last one week in Jammu and Kashmir.

 On Saturday, the eve of Ramzan, the Army thwarted a major Pakistani infiltration attempt, killing six armed intruders along the Line of Control in Uri’s Rampur sector in   district. This was just a day after the Army killed two intruders of Pakistan’s BAT in the same area.
 
 An Army release said that on May 26, “A BAT action attempted on an   post by a group of heavily armed intruders through an area under the control of a Pakistan Army post in the Uri sector, was successfully intercepted resulting in killing of two intruders whose identities are yet to be established.”
 
 Sources, however, said, Saturday’s infiltration attempt was also backed by the Pakistan’s Border Action Team (BAT), which attacked the Indian forward posts to make the entry of the terrorists easy.
 
 The Army spotted suspicious movement along the LoC around 8am, resulting in a gun-battle. “The post is opposite to Pakistan’s 31 Baloch regiment. On noticing the movement, the Army opened fire,” a source said.
 
 An Army spokesperson said the two intruders belonged to the BAT, and were trying to cross over into the valley. “Two bodies, one AK 47 Rifles, one pistol and warlike stores have been recovered,” he said, adding that by gunning down the intruders, the Army successfully repulsed BAT strike as well.
 
 A week ago, on May 21, troops deployed in Nowgam sector, killed four terrorists, foiling a major infiltration attempt.
 
 The Tral encounter in which Hizbul commander   and his aide   were killed on Saturday was also based on a specific military intelligence generated from local sources.
