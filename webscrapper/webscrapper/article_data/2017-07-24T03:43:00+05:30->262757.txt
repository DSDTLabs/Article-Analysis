Margao: The issues of double tracking of Konkan Railway line and proposed Western bypass dominated Seraulimâ€™s gram sabha on Sunday. Former sarpanch Leslie Dourado told TOI that villagers have demanded the panchayat oppose the railway project if it will be used to transport coal from the Vasco port.  The villagers also asked the panchayat to issue a notice to Konkan Railway Corporation for dumping pantry waste from trains as they pass through the village. On the issue of the Western bypass, one of the villagers, Vincy Fernandes, sought that it be built on stilts. tnn
