GUWAHATI: The  , a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (Neda), has said Meghalaya is heading for a "non-Congress" government this time.

 "Today,   is a divided house. People are turning away from the party as anti-incumbency grows stronger by the day. As far as the present political situation is concerned, the prospects of a non-Congress government being formed are very bright,"   working president Paul Lyngdoh told TOI on Sunday. "Regional parties will play a crucial role," he added.
 
 The UDP has entered a pre-poll alliance with two regional parties - the Hill State People's Democratic Party (HSPDP), which holds sway over the Khasi-Jaintia Hills, and the Garo National Council (GNC), the oldest party in the Garo Hills. GNC has been spearheading the demand for carving out a separate state for the Garos.
 
 The UDP-HSPDP combine will contest in 36 seats in the Khasi-Jaintia Hills and the UDP-GNC together will contest 24 seats.
 
 Like NPP, which is also a Neda constituent, the UDP has not entered any tie-up with BJP. The Neda, an umbrella body of regional parties in the northeast, was formed in 2016 after   came to power in Assam. Its aim, as it has said, is to make the northeast 'Congress-mukt'. Meghalaya is one of the two last strongholds of Congress in the northeast.
 
 "Let the elections be over. We will see how the situation turns out. Right now, we are not thinking of any alliance (with BJP). It is clear that regional parties will hold the key to government formation," Lyngdoh said.
 
 In the last assembly election, UDP got eight seats. Prior to that, the party was part of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance coalition government between 2008 and 2009.
