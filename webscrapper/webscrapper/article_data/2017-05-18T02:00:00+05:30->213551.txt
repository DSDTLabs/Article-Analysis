PATNA: Close on the heels of the Patna University Teachers’ Association filing a writ petition in the Patna high court on May 9 against the district administration’s move to engage university and college teachers in election duty, the Magadh University Teachers’ Association ( ) also moved the high court on Wednesday, pleading against the deployment of teachers in the municipal election duty next month.

 MUTA president A K Singh Thakur recalled that the high court in a verdict in 2006 had exempted university and college teachers of Magadh University and Veer Kunwar Singh University from civic body election duties. “Their deployment for municipal election duty is, therefore, a violation of the high court order,” he said and added teachers were ready to face the consequences but would not perform election duty.
 
 According to Thakur, the association has already submitted a memorandum to the State Election Commissioner and the DMs- cum- district election officers of Patna, Nalanda, Nawada, Gaya, Aurangabad, Jehanabad and Arwal districts, urging them not to deploy university and college teachers for election duty.
 
 “However, our memorandum seems to have fallen on deaf ears,” Thakur rued, explaining the reason behind the MUTA decision to move the high court.
 
 Thakur said Magadh University recently completed Degree Part III honours examinations at 60 centres in these seven districts. Teachers have to evaluate the answer books next month. “How can teachers join election duty?” he asked and also added that since the university had introduced semester system at PG level, a section of teachers had to run against time to complete courses of studies.
 
 Meanwhile, B D College Teachers’ Association president R N P Singh and secretary Satish Kumar Sinha have made an appeal to the Patna district administration to exempt college teachers from the civic body election duty in the interest of students.
