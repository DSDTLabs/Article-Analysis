BATHINDA: With only three days left to the start of the wheat procurement season, transporters have rejected the state government’s policy for transportation of food grain as anti-operator. The operators have decided not to carry wheat from grain markets to government depots and have not filled the tenders for transportation. Truck operators from   on Wednesday held   outside the district administrative complex and threatened not to lift wheat from the mandis.

 The operators alleged that as per the new policy framed by the government for loading and transportation of wheat, no truck union could fill tenders. They said only the societies formed under Societies Act, with at least 10-year experience, could fill tenders and the rates fixed for transportation, too, were very low.
 
 Tehal Singh Buttar, who claimed to be the president of Bathinda truck union, said, “Wheat-loading policy, which has been framed recently, is anti-truck operator. It is detrimental to our financial interests. We strongly oppose it and have decided not to transport wheat as truck unions are not allowed to fill tenders. We have showcased our anger by burning a copy of the policy and will keep on protesting against it”.
 
 Bathinda deputy commissioner   said, “The authorities want truck operators to load wheat, still we have made alternative arrangements to ensure wheat procurement runs smoothly.”
