Kolkata: In a veiled criticism of the Narendra Modi government, former President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday said: “A recent report on the Indian economic situation between 2013 and 2017 states that 71% of the total wealth generated in India is accumulated by 21% people, while 79% of the population is left with 29% of the wealth. This cannot go on for long. Change has to be brought about by young people, not by me, not by anybody else.”

 The former President was sharing his thoughts on the essential attributes of an aspiring entrepreneur, the challenges they may encounter and ways to overcome them at a session of Young Indians, the youth wing of Confederation of Indian Industry. “Your responsibility is tremendous. You have to ignite the spirit of others. You must look inward. The onus is on you to remove disparity, inequality and provide dynamic leadership,” Mukherjee told young entrepreneurs. 
 
 Delving further into young entrepreneurs’ responsibilities, he said: “By 2020, 64% of India’s population will be in the working age group. Again, by 2022, India will have the world’s largest working population. The world’s oldest population is getting younger and younger. The responsibility lies on you to remove disparities, enhance employability of this vast chunk of people. You will often hear India has a demographic dividend. But unless 500 million skilled jobs are created, the demographic dividend will turn out to be a demographic disaster.”
 
 Incidentally, the time-frame — 2013-14 — Mukherjee refered to while dwelling on disparities comes seven months after he retired as Presidenton July 24 last year. During his five-year term, he had a constitutional mandate to mouth ‘my government’ in addresses to Parliament — four of which were prepared by the Narendra Modi Cabinet. Now, freed of his constitutional mandate, the former President made what may be construed as a turnaround.
