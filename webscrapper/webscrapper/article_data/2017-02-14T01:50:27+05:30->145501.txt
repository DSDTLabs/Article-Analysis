NEW DELHI: Prices of red   have shot up sharply in the last one week, but that hasn’t deterred people from buying them ahead of  . In fact, florists around the capital are seeing quirky orders which include six-foot bouquets to those made entirely from chocolates.

 A single stem of a red rose may cost you up to Rs 100 if you’re purchasing it from a high-end flower shop and even road-side flower stalls have raised their prices from Rs 10 a stem to Rs 30. “The last few months have been difficult due to demonetisation. So, we are aiming to recover some money this Valentine’s Day. Red roses remain the most popular and are priced at Rs 30 a stem,” said Barun Kumar, a vendor at Mayur Vihar. “The cost of purchasing flowers goes high for us and so we have to sell them at higher prices,” said Mohit, another flower vendor in Saket.
 
 Florists have also introduced items like heart-shaped stuffed toys and teddy bears which they say sell easily as a “combination” gift with roses. High-end flower shops also give their customers a chance to surprise their loved one with special “soap” flowers—artificial flowers with fragrance. Teddy bear bouquets and chocolate bouquets are also popular. “We received an order for a six-foot bouquet of roses, which cost nearly Rs 15,000,” said Saurabh Sharma, manager of Ferns n Petals in Connaught Place.
