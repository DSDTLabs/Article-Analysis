CHANDIGARH: Haryana assembly witnessed uproar on Monday over the issue of cash being offered for the post of the Pehowa municipal council president. 

 The issue allegedly involves the kin of the   (HSSC) chairman.
 
 Speaker   ordered a 50-minute break by adjourning the assembly before sending out the Congress and INLD MLAs out of the house following noisy scenes over the matter.
 
 The issue relates to an audio clip where allegedly   president   claims to have allegedly paid cash to claim the civic body's top post. The audio clip has gone viral. One of the persons in the conversation, allegedly Singla, is heard talking about the payment of Rs 75 lakh out of which Rs 45 lakh had allegedly gone to the kin of HSSC chairman.
 
 Ruckus in the assembly started at 3 pm when the speaker announced about the zero hour. Sandhu rose from his seat for the calling attention motion. Speaker Gujjar had dismissed Sandhu's request by saying that it had come after the deadline set for the moving for the motion.
 
 Sandhu was the first to be named and escorted out by the marshals. As the leader of opposition   raised objection, INLD MLAs joined him and raised the anti-government slogans in the house. They raised the slogans and walked into the well forcing the speaker to name them.
 
 Soon after the INLD MLAs' exit, former speaker and senior Congress legislator R S Kadian too raised the issue. Kadian sought withdrawal of action against the INLD members.
 
  It was followed by commotion from Congress MLAs who too were named and sent out of the assembly.
