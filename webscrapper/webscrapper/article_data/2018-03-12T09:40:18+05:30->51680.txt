 We have, on multiple occasions in the past, written to the President and PM seeking euthanasia. We’re now fully satisfied with the SC judgment, and since the authorities are unable to provide us a better quality of life, they should allow us to die,” said Shashi, who resides in   with her daughter Anamika. They were joined in their dharna by traders association on Sunday.
 
 
  
 
 Shashi and   do not have anyone to look after them, and their condition makes even routine tasks difficult. “The doctors told us that our disease is incurable and if we want to live, we need special treatment for which we have no money. Now, with the SC verdict, we would not have to beg in front of the authorities and can die with ease,” said Anamika, a commerce graduate, who had earlier written a letter in her blood to the President and PM.
