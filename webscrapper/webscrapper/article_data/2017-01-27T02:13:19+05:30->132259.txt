 In another first, a contingent of National Security Guard also participated in the parade that had the highest number of India-made weapon systems on display. However, the showcasing of ‘girl power’ in the past two years was conspicuous by its absence this year. 
 
 Motorcycle daredevilry performed by Shwet Ashwa, a unit of the Corps of Military Police, drew loud cheers from everyone, even foreign dignitaries. 
 
 This time, an Ashok Chakra—the highest peacetime gallantry award—was presented to the widow of Havildar Hangpan Dada of the Assam Regiment. Dada had taken down three terrorists single-handedly in Kashmir. 
 
 Lines from Rabindranath Tagore’s poems found mention in the parade commentary that harped on empowerment of youth and women. The commentators also recounted the rich heritage of India and the achievements in the past year, including GST and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna.
 
 Colourful tableaux from 19 states showcased the cultural diversity of the country. Four of the eight northeastern states were represented this time while Delhi made a comeback after three years with a tableau showcasing a model government school.
