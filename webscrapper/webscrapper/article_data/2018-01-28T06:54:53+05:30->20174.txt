HYDERABAD: Researchers have developed a gene-based stem cell therapy to treat lung injury and severe lung ailments like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The new therapeutic method helps in regeneration of lung tissue using stem cells. This holds promise for lung ailments and also other diseases, researchers said at   on Cell Biology (  - 2018) on Saturday.

 "Our study suggests that in vivo delivery of stemness genes in somatic cells in pathologic loci could be a feasible approach for tissue regeneration. The target cells could transiently acquire the stemness property, which proliferate and differentiate for tissue regeneration more efficiently due to the native identity and microenvironment," said Dr  , distinguished chair professor of National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan. He said, "In vivo gene delivery holds promise for the future treatment of lung diseases such as ARDS or COPD."
 
 Dr Cheng-Wen Wu's laboratory investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis and their diagnostic and therapeutic applications to overcome drug resistance and metastasis in lung cancer treatment.
 
 Stem cell therapy based on transplantation of in vitro propagated stem/progenitor cells has been proposed as potential solution to restore lung functions. However, due to complexity of cell source and lung microenvironment, whether transplanted cells have differentiated for reconstitution of airway/alveolar epithelium were questioned. "Our lab focused on in vivo gene delivery of stemness genes in somatic lung epithelial cells. In mouse model we found that transient gene delivery induced efficient regeneration of alveolar epithelium and improved pulmonary function," he added.
