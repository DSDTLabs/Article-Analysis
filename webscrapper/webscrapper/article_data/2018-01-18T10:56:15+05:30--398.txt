PANAJI: With the   collector Neela Mohanan giving the required approval, the newly-constructed Mala-Patto bridge will be opened for two-way traffic from Monday. Former mayor  , along with other   leaders met Mohanan and requested her to allow for the change.

 “We had a meeting with the collector about the bridge because there was a strong demand from people, and we represented those views before the collector,” councilor Menino Da Cruz said while in the presence of Sidharth Kuncalienkar and   mandal president Dattaprasad Naik.
 
 The BJP leaders met Mohanan with DySP traffic Dharmesh Angle and   traffic cell PI, Brendon D’Souza. “The decision was taken that the Mala bridge, which is currently one-way would be made two-way from Monday. There was also a decision that in the future, with help from GSIDC, the road on the Mala side could be extended a bit to solve the problem of smooth traffic flow,” Da Cruz said.
 
 “The collector informed us that from Monday, the bridge will be two-way and that there was no need for any notification. She explained that since the notification making the bridge one-way had expired, and thus there was no need to for any new notification,” Chodankar said.
 
 Similarly, a decision was taken to make the road coming from Cortin, which connects to the foot over bridge over Rua De Ourem, into a one-way street because of traffic congestion.
