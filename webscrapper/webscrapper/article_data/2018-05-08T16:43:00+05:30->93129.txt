If you enjoy music, Chennai is the place to be in during weekends, for, many gigs happen here. We spotted this bunch of musicians at one of the live shows at a watering hole in the city. With Donan on guitars, K on keys, Soundar on drums and   as the lead vocalist, the band sounded tight and the numbers they played were too irresistible for the   peeps to stay put on their seats. Of course, the guests danced all through their performance. Free-flowing drinks and short eats kept them energised.
