KOCHI: The   has directed the state government to ensure that all   are in place while giving permission to  , stalls etc at   for the  . HC issued the orders after the state government submitted that the operation of a temporary park and other equipment would have to be issued no objection cvertificate (NOC) by the various government agencies. 

 The court was hearing a petition filed by Gireesh M M of Thottumugham in Aluva questioning the local body's move to give on lease the large tract of land lying adjacent to   for commercial activities, including temporary amusement parks with rides such as Columbus, slam boat, well of death, giant wheel, Tora Tora, and dragon train.
 
 Following the court orders, the district administration issued instructions that the temporary amusement park will not be permitted unless it gets all the required clearances needed for operating amusement establishments. The different departments in the government have to immediately consider the question of certification if they receive an application since the event is proposed to come up shortly, the orders said. The additional district magistrate issued the instructions to the Aluva municipality, the PWD, fire safety department and the pollution control board.
 
 The petitioner had alleged that large mechanical devices and power generators are used for operating the amusement rides but they are operated without adopting any measures to ensure safety, the petitioner has alleged. He quoted the news reports about the death of two children on September 8 last year when they fell from a giant wheel at a temporary amusement park set up at Chittar in Pathanamthitta as part of Onam celebrations.
 
 "The main reason for the accident in Pathanamthitta was absence of safety measures and regulations regarding the use of such rides in temporary amusement parks," the petition alleged. The court posted the case to March 1 after the local body sought time for filing an affidavit.
