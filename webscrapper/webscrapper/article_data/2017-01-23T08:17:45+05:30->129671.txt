BENGALURU: Technology often diminishes palpab ility, but it can be harnessed by better technique, said director, screenwriter and producer   on Sunday. 

  At a panel discussion on 'Creative approaches to sustainability' at  , Adoor raised questions on the impact of technology on arts, the role of an artist in society and the need for people, and not just the state, to nurture art. 
 
  Adoor drew a stark contrast, with examples, between the effort and energy that go into preserving art forms at home and abroad and said: "Why must we only depend on government patronage? In our country, art and culture are given last priority - they come after sports in every budget. So it's important to educate people on their responsibility to provide sustenance to performing arts, be it 'koodiyattam' or 'kathakali'." 
 
 Sanjna Kapoor, director of Junoon, the travelling theatre company, said, "Though there's a rich variety of arts in India, we are not doing anything to value them or make them flourish." Odissi, Chau and Manipuri danseuse   felt an artiste must be a risk-taker. "Creativity is the opportunity to keep exploring and learning, and to keep taking risks," Lowen said. Actor, director and screenwriter   of 'U-turn' fame, said: "Rewards and marketing are important for sustainability in arts. As an artiste, I want people to listen to me. To have an audience is vital for sustainability. It is all about finding the right balance between making money and getting work acclaimed critically," he added.
