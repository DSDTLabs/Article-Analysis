Vijayawada: As hectic drama unfolded over the no-confidence motion against the NDA-government in the centre, Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan on Thursday said Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress have colluded to stage this political circus and that they have no seriousness on going ahead with the no-confidence motion.

 Refuting allegations that he was going by a script prepared by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the actor said, “Earlier, they have accused me of being friendly with TDP. Now people are tagging me with BJP. I have made path clear. I will work for the people” he said. He said he has no skeletons in his closet and that it would help him fight against the Union government for special category status.”
 
 He faulted YSRC chief Jaganmohan Reddy for not attending assembly sessions raising the issue of SCS. “If YSRC leaders cannot go to the assembly, they are not fit for democracy,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, TDP MLC Deepak Reddy alleged YSR Congress, BJP and few Congress leaders are influencing Pawan and that there is no need for the public to take him seriously.
 
 Reacting to the political developments on Thursday, BJP state unit vice-president Raghunath Babu said, “Being the opposition in the state, they are not supposed to be at the chief minister’s office. How can TDP allege that just because one YSRC MP was seen at the PMO we colluded with YSRC? Can MPs, MLAs and leaders go to the PMO or CMO” he asked news men. YSRC leader   wondered why TDP is upset with Pawan Kalyan finding fault with them. “When he was silent, there was no problem. Why are they attacking him now,” she sought to know.
 
 AICC president Raghuveera Reddy said his party is ready to support the fight for SCS. His party will support the no confidence motion of the yellow brigade and YSR Congress.
