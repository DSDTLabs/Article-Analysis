 Times Now has further accessed diary notings maintained by Nirav Modi and his team in their computers which are termed 'Unaccounted Payment'. The documents show corresponding entries with identical product details and dates, as the tax invoice raised, where 'Unaccounted' payment to the tune of about Rs 4.8 crore has been made.
 
 During the eight-minute-long conversation with Times Now, Abhishek Singhvi denied any knowledge of the transactions.
 
 To a pointed question about the aforementioned noting, Singhvi said: "I have no idea about her jewellery purchases, but if you have found some statement from somebody's computer, certainly there is no question in the remotest way of accepting that the statement is correct. I don't know what statement you have. This is the first time that I have heard about this statement from you and this is totally something different from what is raised today. I have never heard of it and I deny completely the insinuations."
