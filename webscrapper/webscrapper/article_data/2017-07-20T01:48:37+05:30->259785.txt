NEW DELHI: More than 14% of the road space in the city is occupied by   leading to congestion. A study by cab-aggregator   shows that Delhi would reach its optimal parking limits by 2021 following which parking space on road would be a rarity. As a remedy, the firm is coming up with a solution to add motorbikes as last-mile connectors between colonies and Metro stations to prevent car owners from parking vehicles on roads.

 The study says that Delhiites spend almost 3.43 hours on the road through the day if the average travel distance between work and home is about 40 kilometres. According to experts, the average road speed would come down from the present 25kmph to 5kmph within the next 10 years if corrective measures are not taken.
 
 Delhi spends Rs 60,000 crore per year on traffic and this is likely to go up to Rs 98,000 crore by 2030, the study said. Uber said almost one-third of the emissions can be reduced if commuters shift to ride sharing options provided by cab aggregators.
 
 Uber officials met deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia with the plans to decongest the capital and are in the process of providing inputs from their on-road experiences. They have also proposed converting some private vehicles into commercial ones to promote ride sharing.
