THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM state secretary   said the recent statements of a few BJP leaders indicated that it was high time they were put in chains. "Leaders, including BJP state secretary  , are spouting venom repeatedly," he said in response to the demand made by Radhakrishnan that the director might live in Pakistan if he was unwilling to respect national symbols. 

 "The directive that Kamal may go to Pakistan is a blemish on Kerala which is celebrating its 60th year of state formation. Art and culture have played a major role in saving the society from decay and leading it on the path of progress," Kodiyeri said in a statement issued here.
 
 He said the anger of saffron forces on Kamal had increased after he defended M T Vasudevan Nair, who had criticized PM Narendra Modi. "The patriotic mannerisms of Sangh Parivar, which didn't sacrifice a drop of blood for Independence, is unbearable," said Kodiyeri.
 
 The CPM also condemned the BJP's demand that pictures of Che Guevara installed at various points in the state by DYFI should be removed. "As long as humankind exists, memories of Che will survive," said Kodiyeri.
 
 Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also condemned BJP's attack against Kamal. "Terrorist link allegations against Kamal is a challenge to secular Kerala. BJP's true colours have been revealed," Chennithala said in a statement. He wanted BJP leaders to withdraw their statements and seek an apology from the director.
 
 In a Facebook post, Congress leader K Muraleedharan slammed Sangh Parivar for their call to send Kamal to Pakistan. "Who all need to be sent to Pakistan? Kamal, Kamal Haasan, Shah Rukh Khan, P M Bhargava, Ashok Vajpeyi...The list is unending; those who eat beef, those who delivered two babies and those who burst crackers are all in the list," he wrote.
