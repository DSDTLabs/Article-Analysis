HYDERABAD: On his maiden political yatra in   since the bifurcation in 2014, actor and   (JSP) leader   announced that the party would contest the 2019 elections in both Telangana and  .

 “The party will contest in all the seats where it has the strength,” he said in Karimnagar on Monday. The assessment of the party’s strength in all the constituencies will be made two months prior to the elections. He also started an FB page for the women’s wing of the party on Monday.
 
 On Monday, however, one thing was clear: Pawan Kalyan is a saleable factor in Telangana politics. At Kondagattu Anjaneyaswamy temple in Jagtial, Karimnagar district, where Pawan went to offer special puja, he was received by a large number of slogan-shouting supporters. The enthusiasm of his supporters was evident in Hyderabad itself when he started off from the JSP office. “CM, CM,” they shouted as Pawan got into a car in a convoy.
 
 In the evening, Pawanspoke to the media and met party workers. “What is wrong in meeting chief minister   and conveying greetings to him on the occasion of New Year?” he questioned when asked about the eyebrowraising meeting. He also described KCR as a ‘hardworking and smart chief minister’.
 
 On the cash-for-vote scandal, he said he chose not to react because he did not want to complicate the issue. “This is what all parties do as I know. What the TDP did was wrong. But I felt it was not necessary for me to comment about it at that time,” he said.
 
 Pawan said   president Amit Shah had once suggested to him that there is no scope for regional parties and that he should join the BJP. “In fact, he even refused to acknowledge JSP as a party. I handled the situation sensitively and ignored his advice,” he said. He also said he will not act in any more films for the time being. “Films are not on my mind now,” he said.
 
 After his three-day Telangana tour, the JSP leader will start his yatra in Andhra Pradesh from Anantapur on Jan 27.
