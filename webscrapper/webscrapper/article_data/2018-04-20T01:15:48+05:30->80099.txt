NAVI MUMBAI: The partially damaged wall built by   to keep away  , has now been repaired. The wall was built to stop vendors from encroaching an open plot in sector 10, Belapur, which is close to the main Cidco headoffice in CBD.

 TOI had reported last week how some unknown persons had broken a part of the anti-encroachment wall, so that the illegal hawkers could continue doing business at the spot. 
 
 The office of Cidco   (CUC) had also written to CBD police station about the damaged wall near the plot. 
 
 Sources informed that the broken wall was rebuilt a few days back. The security guards have been directed to stay alert and report any untoward activities at the site.
 
 “Cidco took a positive step and repaired the damaged wall. It will send out a strong message to the encroachers against damaging public property to carry out their illegal business,” said   activist Anarjit Chauhan. Cidco had first taken action against the illegal vendors at this site in November last year.
