MARGAO: Three days after the   of the  , Curchorem, there has been no headway into the investigations. 

 The police brass exuded confidence that “some certain clues” obtained by them could lead to detection of the case, but remain tightlipped over the probe.
 
 Police suspect that the same gang could be involved in the vandalisation of the cemetery at Curchorem and other cases of desecration of roadside structures reported earlier. 
 
 “Looking at the modus operandi in all the recent cases of desecration, it appears that the same gang may be involved,” South   SP Arvind Gawas told TOI, but hastened to add that nothing could be said for certain at this stage.
 
 “We have obtained several clues from our investigations on which we are working meticulously. It is a massive exercise that we are presently engaged in which also entails elimination techniques of investigation in order to zero in on the suspects,” Gawas said.
 
 Police sources said that the movements of some of the suspects are being closely monitored by the cops. A senior police official said that public hasn’t been forthcoming in providing any information pertaining to any of the desecration cases so far, thereby making it that much difficult for the police in obtaining workable clues.
 
 Meanwhile, the parish priest of Guardian Angel Church, Curchorem, Fr Vital Miranda, speaking to TOI, said that he has appealed to the people to observe restraint and maintain communal harmony. “People have realized that these acts are aimed at disrupting communal amity, and so they have shown exemplary tolerance. I have appealed to the people to stay calm and not to get excited,” he said, adding that a special prayer service will be held at the Church on Friday.
