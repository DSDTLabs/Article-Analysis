Ahmedabad: Former director of Sabarmati Ashram and the current chairman of MICA governing council, Dr Tridip Suhrud, has been appointed professor and director of CEPT Archives. Suhrud took up his new assignment on Tuesday.

 Suhrud will take over from Khushroo Kalyanwala who set up the CEPT Archives—one of the first initiatives in the country to archive information related to architecture, planning, design, and allied disciplines in India and South Asia. 
 
 
 CEPT Archives has already acquired many collections and is set to be a key institution for scholars and researchers in South Asia. Suhrud has extensively worked on the life and thought of Mahatma Gandhi as well as the social and cultural history of modern Gujarat. 
 
 He has also translated various literary and social science texts from English to Gujarati and vice versa, his notable works being the four volumes of ‘Saraswatichandra’. He was given the Katha Award (1999) and Sahitya Akademi Award in 2010 for his translations. 
 
 Prior to joining CEPT University, Suhrud was director and chief editor of Sabarmati Ashram. He led a team for digitisation and preservation of Gandhi archives and setting up a new building for the purpose. His past academic affiliations included NID (Ahmedabad) the DAIICT (Gandhinagar), and the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla.
