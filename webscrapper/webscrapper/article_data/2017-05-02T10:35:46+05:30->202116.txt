SHIMLA: While   are claiming that the recent rally of   would not have any impact on coming   as he gave nothing to the state, Leader of Opposition   has said that the massive gathering during the rally has left Congress leaders baffled, who are giving baseless statements.

 Dhumal said that NDA regime headed by Modi has increased the state’s share in central taxes from 32% to 42%. Also the state has been given its special category status which was snatched by UPA government. He said it was Modi who has given the 'One Rank One Pension' by allotting Rs 15000 crore.
 
 He said it is a matter of pride for Himachal Pradesh that low cost air service “UDAN” was launched from Shimla in which one could travel by air between Shimla and Delhi by spending just Rs 1980. He said this air service would also benefit the tourism industry of state.
 
 He said instead of thanking Modi for providing air connectivity to Shimla after a gap of over four years, Congress leaders were indulging into negative politics. 
 
 He also said that massive gathering of people from across the state during Parivartan Rally at the Ridge has made it clear that BJP is going to form the next government in Himachal Pradesh and this fact has left Congress leaders baffled.
