GHAZIABAD: A 14-year-old girl was critically injured allegedly after falling off the sixth-floor   of her flat in   on Monday night. The girl, a Class VIII student, is in the ICU of a private hospital. 

 The girl’s   have refused to speak to the media. Sources, however, said her father Rahul Sharma, a property consultant, told police that his daughter had been studying when he went off to sleep and he had asked her to go to bed soon after. 
 
 It could not be immediately confirmed if the girl had accidentally slipped off the balcony or she attempted a suicide. The incident at Shipra Krishna Vista housing society in Indirapuram comes barely seven days after a four-year-old girl in another society in the area died after falling off the balcony.
 
 It was around 12.45am when Ram Kishor, a guard at Shipra Krishna, heard a loud thud near Tower F. “The guard found the girl lying in an area underneath their balcony. She was bleeding and breathing faintly. He and another guard called up her parents who took her to Shanti Gopal Hospital,” security supervisor Umesh Kumar said.
 
 The girl was shifted to   in Vaishali on Tuesday morning when her condition deteriorated. Hospital sources said she had suffered multiple fractures and her condition was serious.
