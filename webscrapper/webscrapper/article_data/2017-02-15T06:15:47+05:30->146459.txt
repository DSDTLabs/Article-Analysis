 A seat of knowledge in the days of yore, St Joseph’s High School was founded by William Robert Lyons, a missionary, in the serene North Goa village of Arpora in 1887. Being the first English medium school in Goa, it was thronged by studentswith many travelling from as far as Salcete to gain a holistic education. The institution eventually became a force to reckon with in both, academics and sports. 
 
 The DSE took over the school’s operations in 1967, following Goa’s Liberation from Portuguese rule.
