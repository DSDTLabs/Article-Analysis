Pune: The setting up of the National Housing Bank (NHB), as proposed in the Union Budget, is expected to give a boost to the affordable housing segment in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

 “The setting up of NHB will benefit affordable housing projects with dedicated funds for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana schemes. Usually, it gets difficult for the realty sector to get funds as they are not on the priority list of financial institutions,” Shrikant Paranjape, president of Credai (Pune Metro), said. 
 
 In last year’s Budget, affordable housing was given an infrastructure status. “NHB will help in easing fund disbursal for the realty sector,” Maharashtra Credai president Shantilal Kataria said, adding that their request to increase PMAY subsidies and remove taxation on unsold inventory was not addressed in the Budget.
 
 Rohit Gera, MD, Gera Developments, said even as the NHB has been the only announcement under affordable housing in the Budget, realtors should adopt a wait-and-watch approach as far as implementation is concerned.
 
 Developer Sachin Kulkarni said the taxation of income from investments in mutual funds may bring back investors to real estate.
 
 Besides affordable housing, realtors said there was nothing much to look forward to in the Budget. “These sops are not enough to soothe the negative impact of note ban and GST. We were looking for some deduction in the corporate tax, which did not happen,” Rajesh Mhatre, CEO, Vascon Engineers Ltd, said.
