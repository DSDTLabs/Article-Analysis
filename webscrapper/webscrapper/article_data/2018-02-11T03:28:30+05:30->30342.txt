NEW DELHI: Hundreds of   students turned up at the administrative block dubbed as ‘azaadi chowk’ and removed the flower pots placed there in a mark of protest against the compulsory   rule.

 Earlier, around 2,000 people — students as well as teachers — formed a ‘human chain’ to support the protest against the attendance rule. 
 
 “We received an excellent response from the students,” said Shubanshu Singh, joint secretary of JNU Student’s Union ( ). Singh said that the struggle against attendance “is against the anti-student policies of this administration such as the compulsory attendance, scuttling of GSCASH and reservation policies in admissions.”
 
 Singh said that their struggle will continue and there will be a strike on Monday supported by all political outfits in the campus.. 
 
 Meanwhile, members of NSUI who had blocked the approach road to JNU’s administrative block since February 5 and had cooked pakodas to protest against the PM’s remarks were issued notices and asked to pay a fine of Rs 20,000.
