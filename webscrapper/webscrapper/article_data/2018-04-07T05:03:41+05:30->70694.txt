More than 100 representatives of 35 Maratha groups from across   are going to attend a conference in Kolhapur on Saturday to decide the future course of action to pitch their demand for reservation. 

 Madhukar Patil, one of the conveners of the conference, said, "We took to streets to meet our demand of reservation, which has not been fulfilled by the current government. After over 50 rallies, the government gave several assurances to the community for the benefit of students, women and farmers. However, the government has not yet started the implementation of the assurances." The organizers claim that the discussion only over the reservation issue will take place. The recent judgment by the   over the SC, ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act will be discussed.
