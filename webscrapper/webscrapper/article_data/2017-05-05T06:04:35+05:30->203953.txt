BENGALURU: Rumblings against corruption and nepotism in   are all set to get louder, with a complaint being lodged against chief minister   and 27 ministers over shunting of police officers. 

 The development has come a day after the government issued general transfer policy (guidelines) asking employees to desist from using political influence for appointments or transfers. But ironically, these warnings don’t deter either employees or the tribe of political fixers and brokers.
 
 “In every department, there is corruption and political influence in appointments, promotions and transfers. It is the straightforward officials who suffer. For two years, I have been trying to get evidence to expose this but have failed,” said B P Manje Gowda, president, Karnataka State Government Employees’ Association.
 
 Though the government decided not to transfer officials of some key departments owing to drought, it was forced to issue a general transfer order with a June 15 deadline under pressure from legislators. The deadline may be extended by 15 days, department of personal and administrative reforms (DPAR) sources said.
 
 The ‘transfer industry’ in Karnataka has been blooming over the past decade. According to practitioners of the trade, the most lucrative departments are irrigation, public works, revenue, forest and police. Education and health are relatively dry departments.
 
 The industry works in two ways — the officials either pay money to higher ups through middlemen to secure transfers to preferred locations or remain loyal to politicians who ensure the posting of their choice. “The amount depends on how lucrative the post is. While some pay the money only to recover it later, others, like teachers, do it just to get unwanted postings cancelled. 
 
 “On an average, officials pay Rs 5-25 lakh for key postings, depending on the district and city. Second-rung officials pay Rs 1-5 lakh,” said K Ravishnakar, a retired bureaucrat. 
 
 It’s not just the present government. Previous governments too have nurtured corrupt practices, which have reached alarming proportions in the last decade or so, say some government employees. “It has destroyed the basic fabric of the administration, because people get into a position by bribing and stay there by bribing. There is money involved in appointments, postings, transfers and stopping of transfers. Only the level varies depending on the demanding capacity of politicians and paying capacity of officials. When an official pays money to get a post, the effort is focused only on collecting several times more from the public,” claimed Mallesh, a farmer leader and   activist.
