PANAJI: The state government has identified around 7 million tonnes of iron   lying inside and outside   leases, according to an affidavit it will file before the   of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday. This includes 1.5 million tonnes of ore lying at jetties and other plots, and 5.17 million tonnes inside lease areas. 

 The state government said that from 2015 to 2018, mining companies extracted 35 million tonnes of ore. Town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai, who is a member of the CAC, said that the state government would seek clarity on what to do with the ore extracted and lying inside the lease areas. 
 
 Transport minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, also a CAC member, said that the state government has received opinions from the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters’ Association (GMOEA) and workers’ unions on its response to the mining case in the Supreme Court. The government, he said, is also waiting for lawyer Harish Salve to give his opinion. After he does, the state is likely to approach the Union government to finalise its course of action. 
 
 On February 7, the Supreme Court quashed the renewal of 88 mining leases and directed the state government to stop   ore operations on March 15. Then, in March, the high court of Bombay at Goa ordered an immediate suspension of transportation of all minerals related to the mining operations of the 88 leaseholders. Mining companies later approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court’s order. 
 
 A bench of Justice Madan Lokur and Deepak Gupta allowed the companies to transport iron ore out of the state after they contended that a huge amount was lying at the port and it was excavated in compliance with the apex court’s earlier order.
