NEW DELHI: Top constitutional experts, former chief justices and judges of the   and a former secretary general of   termed the failed attempt to remove the Chief Justice of India as “unfortunate” and “suicidal”.

 
 Some of these jurists were consulted by Vice-President and Chairman of   M   who rejected the removal motion moved by Congress-led opposition parties. Eminent jurist Fali S Nariman called the move “a horribly black day in the history of the Supreme Court”. 
 
 He added that it would open the door for the ruling party to move against a judge if it didn’t like a particular judgment.
 
 Former   T S Thakur said, “This is very unfortunate that the top judiciary is faced with such a crisis.” Former SC judge Justice B   called the move to remove the CJI “suicidal and dangerous”. He added that there was little evidence to back the claims made by the opposition to prove “misbehaviour” on part of the CJI.
 
 He said irregularities did not amount to misbehaviour. “In any removal proceedings, politics can’t be avoided. In the present case, they are dragging, may be unintentionally, the judiciary into party politics which is dangerous,” Justice Reddy said.
 
 Constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash C Kashyap described the move as pure party politics. He said under the Constitution, only the President could be impeached while Article 124 talked about only removal of a judge for proven misconduct and incapacity.
 
 “There is nothing like impeachment of a judge in the Constitution,” he said. Speaking at a seminar earlier this month, Justice  , the seniormost judge in the SC after the CJI, had said removal of the CJI was not a solution. “I do not understand why people are obsessed about removal. This cannot be the solution of every problem.”
