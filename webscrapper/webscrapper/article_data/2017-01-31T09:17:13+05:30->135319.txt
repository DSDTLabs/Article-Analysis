RAJKOT: The medical fraternity and members of the Rajkot unit of   (IMA) took out a rally in the city on Monday against section 304 (  not amounting to murder) often slapped against medical practitioners after patients die during treatment. 

 Under the banner of IMA, doctors took out the rally and submitted a memorandum to the city police commissioner  . They demanded that police should not add this section without proper verification of the case. Private medical practitioners also observed a bandh for half day in support of the protest and joined the silent rally. 
 
 “Even after the Supreme Court’s directives and state government’s resolution not to slap culpable homicide section against doctors treating patients, police is still harassing us by booking many under this section. We condemn this and lodge our protest against the police,” IMA said in a statement. 
 
 “All doctors try to save patients’ lives and their ultimate goal is to see their recovery. However, patients die during treatment due to various causes but kin of deceased often blame doctors and lodge police complaint. As per SC’s guideline to police in cases related to patients’ death, police should consult doctors to ascertain the cause of death,” said  , president of IMA’s Rajkot chapter.
