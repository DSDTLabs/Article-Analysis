LUDHIANA:   of   —  , 65, and his son  , 35 — continued for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. Even after holding two meetings with dera followers in a day, senior police officials failed to convince them to perform the last rites of the vitims. The followers present in Jaghera remained inflexible in their demand of arrest of the father-son duo’s shooters. Meanwhile, a special investigating team (SIT), led by DIG Ludhiana range S K Kalia, has been set up to probe the case.

 As reported by TOI earlier, the victims, who owned a cloth shop, were performing service at the dera’s ‘Naam Charcha Ghar’ in Jaghera village in Payal area of Ludhiana on Saturday evening when two bike-borne criminals shot them.
 
 On Tuesday, dera followers continued their agitation and blocked the Ludhiana-Malerkotla Road for the second consecutive day forcing police to make diversions at different points on the route to avoid trouble for commuters. The area is under a heavy pall of tension and police personnel have been deployed in large numbers in the village.
 
 Talking about their dialogue with police, a   of the dera said that the police officers demanded one week to arrest the murderers. He said that rest of things depends upon the high command of dera and they would follow whatever decision comes from the top.
 
 Khanna SSP Satinder Singh said, “The police have some clues and several teams are working day and night to solve the case. However, we need some more time to reach the killers so we have asked dera followers to cremate the dead bodies.”
 
 The SIT lead by DIG Kalia has SSP Singh, SP detective Satnam Singh, DSP Shahkot (in Jalandhar rural) Gurpreet Singh, DSP (Banga) Harvinder Singh Dalli, inspector Rajan Parminder Singh (Ludhiana rural), inspector Baljinder Singh (SBS Nagar) and inspector Sanvir Singh as members.
