AHMEDABAD:   on Friday started hearing petitions filed by fisheries minister  , demanding quashing of criminal prosecution and an arrest warrant issued against him in connection with the alleged Rs 400-crore fisheries scam.

 A special anti-corruption court in   began a case against Solanki two years ago, on basis of a voluminous report filed by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). The probe agency also implicated then cabinet minister Dilip Sanghani and five retired government officials in the case.
 
 During the hearing, the advocate for Ishaq Maradia, the complainant, submitted that the process was initiated against Solanki after the governor granted sanction to prosecute him and the ACB filed an investigation report. Hence, the high court may permit the trial court to go ahead with the trial.
 
 Justice J B Pardiwala posted a further hearing for February 16.
 
 In January 2016, the high court stayed a non-bailable warrant issued against Solanki by the special court.
 
 In this case, Maradia sought the HC’s intervention to unearth the alleged irregularities, cancellation of fishing contracts and for governor’s sanction for criminal prosecution of the minister.
 
 Solanki was accused of awarding fishing contracts to cooperative groups in 58 reservoirs across the state without following any tendering process. The minister defended himself by arguing that the contracts were awarded according to the new policy adopted by the state government, to empower the tribal communities and the contracts were given to cooperative groups formed by members of such communities.
