SHILLONG: Independent legislator   has been booked by   for his alleged role in  . 

 "We have registered a case against Julius Dorphang under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for his involvement in sexually exploiting a minor," SP Vivek Syiem said on Monday.
 
 The matter first came to light last month when a waiter at a state guest house owned by state home minister HDR Lyngdoh's son was arrested for trafficking a 14-year-old girl. 
 
 The girl was rescued near the guest house and told the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) that she had been "taken" to several guest houses and hotels. Police are examining the roles of all those accused in the sex racket, allegedly involving politicians.
 
 Police are investigating Dorphang's role in the case, after which they will move the court for an arrest warrant, Syiem said.
 
 Dorphang, a legislator from Mawhati and also the founder-chairman of the outlawed Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) militant outfit, was not available for comment.
 
 Based on the victim's statement, four other women in the city were picked up and subsequently arrested last month for allegedly acting as pimps for the girl.
 
 Meanwhile, SCPCR chairperson Meena Kharkongor has directed public prosecutor I C Jha to oppose any bail application of the arrested persons involved in the case.
 
 The Civil Society Women's Organization has demanded immediate arrest of the MLA besides a thorough investigation into the case.
