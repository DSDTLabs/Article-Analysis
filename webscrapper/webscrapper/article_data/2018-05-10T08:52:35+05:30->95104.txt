NEW DELHI: Young   sensation   is ready to take the next big leap. The 16-year-old from Haryana has said that she will now be paying equal attention to the 25m sport pistol category, apart from her pet   event.

 
 
 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Manu said she would be sending entries in both categories in the Munich (senior) and Suhl (junior) World Cups and Czech Republic tournament. She will also look to earn quota places in both events at the Changwon World Championships in Korea from August 31 to September 15, which will double up as the Olympic qualifier ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games.
 
 
 
 Manu’s intentions mean   may have some serious competition in both the 10m air pistol and 25m sport pistol events. At the Gold Coast CWG, Manu had pipped Heena (silver) to win gold in the 10m air pistol. However, Heena stamped her supremacy by winning gold in the 25m sport pistol. Manu didn’t compete in the category.
 
 “I have started focusing on the 25m sport pistol event. I need to get better in the 25m event. I have got good rankings in the seniors division, so I’ll try to do well in both events. After the Munich and Suhl World Cups, I’ll again compete in both categories at the ‘28th Meeting of the Shooting Hopes’ in Plzen and the Changwon championships,” Manu said at a promotional event here.
 
 She added: “I’ll continue shooting in both the junior and senior categories as long as the two are not clashing in the same competition. Like in Changwon, I’ll compete in the senior division for a quota place.”
 
 While Manu may have spelt out her intentions for the Changwon qualifier, everything will depend on what the National Rifle Association of India’s ( ) selection committee decides.
