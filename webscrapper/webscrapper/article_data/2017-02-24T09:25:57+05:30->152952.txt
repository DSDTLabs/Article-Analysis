PANAJI: A professor from the department of   at   (GU), B Ramesh, has been suspended for his involvement in an alleged  . A one-man inquiry committee has been set up to investigate the matter. 

 In October 2010, Ramesh, the then head and dean of the faculty of commerce, organized an all-India commerce conference, prior to which he had agreed to submit audited financial accounts to the Goa University following the culmination of the event. The GU allotted Rs 5 lakh for the conference and directed Ramesh to raise the rest of the amount through sponsorships. The funds required were eventually received from different organizations within Goa and beyond. 
 
 But, for five years after the conference was held, Ramesh allegedly did not provide the university with the accounts. After a prolonged wait, the GU, in 2015, gave the professor a month’s time to produce the audited accounts through an external auditor. When these statements were presented to the university, its internal auditors examined them and found grave irregularities.
 
 Reports prepared by the internal auditor were placed before the university’s executive council in the same year, following which Ramesh was given an opportunity to be heard. The council, however, wasn’t convinced with his statements. This led the reconstituted council of October 2016 to place the professor under suspension.
 
 The suspension was effected from January 31 this year and GU vice-chancellor Varun Sahani, appointed advocate Ulhas Pai Raikar to conduct the inquiry. Raikar is expected to submit his report to the university’s executive council within six months, following which the council will take appropriate action.
 
 Anugraha Mohapatra, an associate professor from GU’s mathematics department, was also suspended this month following prime facie evidence against him of sexually harassing a student.
