CHANDIGARH: A Delhi court on Thursday allowed  's plea to file a list of additional witnesses to endorse documents in a disproportionate assets case lodged against former Haryana CM O P  . Special judge   permitted CBI's application in which it has said that various bank statements and other records were obtained during the probe and to “prove“ these, some witnesses were required to be summoned.

 “Photocopies of income tax return of accused (Chautala) and his wife are required to be proved from original by summoning witness from I-T department concerned along with original records,“ the application had said.
 
 Advocate Harsh  , who appeared for Chautala, had opposed plea and sought dismissal saying the agency has been in possession of all documents since the time the initial investigation was carried out and it was not clear as to why additional witnesses were being called.
