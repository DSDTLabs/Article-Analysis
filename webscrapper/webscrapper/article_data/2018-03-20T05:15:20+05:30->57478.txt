MUMBAI: Health minister Deepak Sawant told the state assembly on Monday that 14,287 new   had been detected in the state in   2018. Last September, in a special drive, 4.5 crore people were examined and 5,073 new cases were detected, he said. 

 "The previous government had said the state was leprosy-free but we have been finding and treating cases in special drives," he told the state assembly.
 
 From May 2016 to February 2017, nearly 12,000 people in the state, including 500-odd from Mumbai, were detected with leprosy. These numbers suggest that the Union government's proposal to eliminate the disease by 2018 is not only unattainable but also a faraway dream. Experts said many of the newly-affected cases were children. Statistically, the disease was eliminated from India in 2005. tnn
