AHMEDABAD: The women’s cell of city police on Saturday arrested Keyur Desai, the husband of Rashesha Desai, who is the daughter of retired IPS officers V V Rabari. Police sources said Desai was arrested for harassment, cheating and criminal intimidation.

  Panna Momaya said that as Rashesha had expressed concerns about a threat to her security from her husband, they produced Desai in court.
 
 The court rejected the three-day remand application and scheduled the hearing of Desai’s bail plea for Sunday. He was sent to judicial custody.
 
 Police sources said Rashesha, a yoga intructor, had earlier moved   high court, seeking protection from her father, retired IPS officer and   leader, V V Rabari and her husband, Keyur Desai, who were allegedly opposed to her working.
 
 “She had retracted her complaint against her father and husband but last Tuesday again approached us with a complaint against her husband, Keyur Desai, under sections 498 (a), 406, 420 and 506(2) of IPC,” a senior women’s police official said.
 
 Police officials said she had complaint about her husband’s high handedness and that he had denied her a flat which was given to her by her father at the time of her wedding.
 
 “After primary investigation, we issued a notice to Keyur Desai to remain present before us. We then arrested him under the charges mentioned in the FIR. Normally, no arrests are made in complaints regarding 498(a) before the investigation is over, but as Rashesha had expressed concerns about her security, we arrested Desai and produced him before the magistrate,” added a senior police official.
