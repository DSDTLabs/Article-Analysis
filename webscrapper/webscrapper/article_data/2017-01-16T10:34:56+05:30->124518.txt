BENGALURU: Last week, Prime Minister   spoke at the   on how his government would encourage investments by   (PIOs) and   (OCIs) and strengthen their ties with India. For Vincent, an OCI card holder from New York, life has been far from easy in a country battling the consequences of demonetization. 

 Vincent was carrying Rs 10,000 in old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes when he arrived in Bengaluru on a two-week visit. The banker, who participated in the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, last visited the country in July 2016.
 
 "At that time I had exchanged some money at   and UAE Exchange in Bengaluru and Mangaluru. I used it to pay transportation fare and excess baggage rates. But demonetization rules bar me from depositing or exchanging the old notes that I have left with me. Despite writing to the RBI, I have got no help," said Vincent.
 
 As per RBI guidelines dated December 31, 2016, a facility for exchange of Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) is available for resident and non-resident Indians who could not use the facility from No vember 10 to December 30, 2016 on account of their absence from India. It can be availed at the five RBI branches in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Nagpur. 
 
 When Vincent visited the RBI office in Bengaluru to deposit/exchange the notes, he was shocked to know the facility was not available. 
 
 "As I can't go to either of the five cities, I have requested the government to allow me to deposit Rs 10,000 to my NRO account with Corporation Bank via RBI Bengaluru," he added.
 
 A copy of Vincent's email dated January 7, 2017 (available with TOI) to the RBI Public Query address says he is in possession of all the documents pertaining to the money exchange in July and is ready to submit them.
