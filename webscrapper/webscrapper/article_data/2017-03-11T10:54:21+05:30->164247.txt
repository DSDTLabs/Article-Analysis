NASHIK:   farmers are a worried lot with prices of the crop oscillating and their wait for government assistance only getting longer.

 Seven months ago, the government had decided to grant Rs 100 per quintal or Rs 1 per kg to onion farmers who sold their produce between July 1 and August 31 last year in meagre prices at the   (APMCs).
 
 The limit was further raised to 200 quintals for each  . The department of cooperatives sent a proposal of the grants worth Rs 14.39 crore to the state government for 37,452 farmers, which they are yet to receive.
 
 An official from the department of cooperatives said, “We had sent a proposal of around 36,000 farmers for the grant totally worth Rs 14 crore, to the state government in November last year. But, there is no further communication from the state government.” 
 
 As per the data provided by the district APMCs, 1.94 lakh farmers sold 28 lakh quintals of onions at 15 APMCs in the district between July 1 to August 31. These farmers were expected to receive a grant of Rs 28 crore quintals. But only 37,452 farmers applied for the grant within the deadline set by the government. 
 
 The farmers who applied for the grants made a total sale of 14.39 lakh quintals of onions in July-August period in the district APMCs and were expected to get a total grant of Rs 14.39 crore.
