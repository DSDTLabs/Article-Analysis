Mumbai: It was the second ball of the 16th over. India had England by the ropes at 102/7 in the dead-rubber last league game of the T20 tri-series at the Brabourne Stadium on Thursday. Batswoman Danielle Hazell tried to slog one down the ground but it hit the toe of the bat and looked like it was going for a boundary. India skipper  , fielding at long-off, dashed towards it, dived and took a stunning onehanded catch to add to England’s misery.

 
 While the catch didn’t have much of an impact on the outcome of the match, which India won comfortably by eight wickets, it showed the grit India lacked in the field in their last three games of the series. The hosts had lost all their previous games, giving them no chance of qualify for the final to be played between Australia and England on Saturday.
 
 On Thursday though, the hosts, led by the spinners, upped their game. Offspinner Anuja Patil was the pick of the bowlers, returning with impressive figures of 3/21. She was helped by   (2/17), Radha Yadav (2/16) and Deepti Sharma (2/24). They managed to take wickets at crucial junctures which put England on the back foot. Or perhaps, England hadn’t recovered from their eight-wicket loss to Australia on Wednesday.
 
  was the top-scorer with a 22-ball 31. Once she was dismissed by Deepti Sharma on the second last ball of the sixth over (caught & bowled), it all went downhill for the visitors, who could only set India a meagre target of 108.
 
  (62* off 41 balls) scored her third half-century of the series to help India reach the target in just 15.4 overs. India went back to their original opening pair of Mandhana and Mithali Raj, with youngster Jemimah Rodrigues coming in at No.3.
 
 BRIEF SCORES: England 107 all out in 18.5 overs (Danielle Wyatt 31; Anuja Patil 3/21, Poonam Yadav 2/ 17, Radha Yadav 2/16, Deepti Sharma 2/24) lost to India 108/2 in 15.4 overs (Smriti Mandhana 62*, Harmanpreet Kaur 20*; Danielle Hazell 2/17) by 8 wickets.
