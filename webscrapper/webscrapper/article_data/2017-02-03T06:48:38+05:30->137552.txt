AHMEDABAD: For the first time in recent years, traffic has gained centrestage in the revised   ( ) budget placed before the board by the standing committee on Thursday.

 The committee added Rs 450 crore of projects to the municipal commissioner’s budget of Rs 6,101 crore, taking the total outlay to Rs 6,551 crore. A bulk of the additional projects were for allocation to flyovers and underpasses — at the Kankaria-Ambika Mill stretch, Odhav-Rajendra Park Crossroads, Chandlodia railway crossing, Cadila railway overbridge, Sola overbridge on SG Highway and Pallav Crossroads in Naranpura. 
 
 A total of Rs 18.5 crore has been laid for feasibility studies of all these projects. Beside this, a decision to strengthen the city traffic management committee has been taken. This will see the setting up of a senior citizen traffic counsel to address traffic issues of the elderly. 
 
 Five flyovers—Shivaranjini, CTM double decker flyover, Bapunagar, Gota railway overbridge and ITI underpass will be repaired.
 
 This year, AMC will take up a multi-crore project to redevelop and widen CG Road. AMC is also earmarking a special budget for renovating the BRTS corridor. AMC this year plans to introduce an automatic parking system along with the   (ITMS). 
 
 AMC will spend Rs 10 crore on wall-to-wall carpeting of 60km of road to declare them “dust free”. To curb stray cattle, AMC is planning to identify a few plots alongside the SP Ring Road to set up animal hostels for the pastoral community. Rs 1 crore is earmarked for a feasibility study. 
 
 “This year we have earmarked a special budget for organizing cultural events for Divyang children,” says standing committee chairman Praveen Patel.
