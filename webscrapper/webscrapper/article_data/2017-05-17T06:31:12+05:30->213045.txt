DEHRADUN: The prasad made of local ingredients such as Chaulai, baby corn dry fruits and ghee is being introduced in around 11 main temples of various parts of   to encourage local   and generate livelihood. The routine prasad of cardamom seeds with mishri is being replaced now. Local women are undergoing training in making this prasad in the form of laddoos. The training period at Hanol and Lakhamandal has just finished. This project of rural tourism is being implemented by Infrastructure development investment programme of Asian Development bank.

 The series of temples which have been included are Hanol temple Lakhamandal, Kalimath temple, Kartik Swami temples in Rudraprayag and Jageshwar temple in Almora, Devidhura, Katarmal, Mukhba, Tungnath, Neelkhanth.
  
  
  
 Bharat Patwal, team leader of Pauri-based Institute of Development Support, told TOI, “The prasad of cardamom seed with mishri is being served in temples all across the state barring some exception. However, there is immense scope to support the organic agriculture products where local people can be encouraged to take up farming on larger scale with which they will earn handsome amount. Along with that those who would make this prasad and sell them will also earn as well. So this can be an effective tool to reduce migration in these pockets of the state.”
 
 He said, the prasad has been tested for its shelf life for one month, so pilgrims coming from other states and countries can easily take it home and share with their dear ones.
  
 Patwal said they have sought permission from the respective authorities of these temples. He said, polythene bags in which the boxes with prasad have been replaced with jute bags bear the name of the temple concerned.
  
 Neelam Devi, trainee at Lakhamadal temple, said, “Local women have got employment in making and packaging the laddoos. Our men will also get work and, most importantly, the pilgrims will get to taste our ethnic products.”
