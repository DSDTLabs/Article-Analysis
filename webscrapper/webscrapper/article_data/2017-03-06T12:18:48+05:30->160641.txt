The first weekend of Emirates Airline Literature Festival 2017 got way too starry as Jeffery Archer discussed the art of writing stories in a sold-out session to some 500 people. 

 As the Emirates Airlines Lit Fest kicked off on March 3, the first weekend witnessed the bestselling author launching the cover for his upcoming short story collection, 
 , and also read a story from the anthology to be published by  . The author discussed his favourite writers and provided some valuable insight to aspiring storytellers on the modus operandi for a good short story. 
 
 Archer endorsed his belief that not every author is necessarily a good short-story writer. He said that some are way better at writing the novel. "For example, when it comes to novelists   is so brilliant he can do both. But then you get someone like Somerset Maugham who is far better short storyteller than a novelist. His novels never quite captured the magic of his shorter works," said the 76-year-old author. 
 
 Archer cited his favourite short story writers,   ( ) and  , and appealed his audience to follow the path paved by these great storytellers. “Any human being who wants to learn how to write a short story should study (Saki’s) Sredni Vashtar”, spoke Archer. 
 
 Archer also dealt with the topic of critiquing one’s own writing. According to him, an author must scrutinize his/her writing in the sternest way and that asking their friends and family is futile since they will invariably patronize, therefore, lie.   maintains that the most ingenious way to have one’s work reviewed impartially is to “give your work to a friend and tell them to please show it to someone without name on it. Ask him or her to read it.” One might get the truth only this way.
