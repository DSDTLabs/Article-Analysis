MUMBAI: A young female   was found beached at Manori village with three of its four flippers severed. The Olive   turtle is extremely weak and in a critical condition.

 A few of villagers who found the turtle dropped it into a nearby well on Saturday, said Ankit Vyas, volunteer for Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, a government agency. A local resort owner took the turtle and later handed it over to the forest authorities.
 
 The turtle, which has only its hind right   intact, is about 10 or 12 years of age, said veterinarian Dinesh Vinherkar who is treating it. “The turtle has not been able to move forward or change direction as there’s very little muscle mass attached to its sole flipper,” Dr Vinherkar said, adding that it might be difficult for the turtle to survive in the wild. “Its eyeballs have sunk in and its physical condition is quite bad. But we’ll do our best to help it survive.”
 
 Range forest officer Prashant Deshmukh told TOI that the turtle’s limbs could have been injured due to fishing nets or propellers. “During the rains, such injuries are quite common with turtles, especially females that come to lay eggs near beaches.”
