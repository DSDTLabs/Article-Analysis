NEW DELHI: BJP has named 80 Dalit leaders for the Uttar Pradesh   polls, belying opposition allegations that the party’s pre-poll campaigns to empower the community was a poll gimmick.

 R K Choudhray and Dinanath Bhaskar, who were associates of BSP founder Kanshi Ram and helped him launch the Dalit empowerment campaign in UP, are in the list of BJP candidates even as the party has pinned its hopes on non-Yadav Other Backward Classes, fielding almost 40% of its candidates from the grouping. Assembly polls will be held in UP in seven phases from February 11 to March 8.
 
 On Tuesday, BJP announced 67 more candidates of which 26 were from backward castes, taking their tally to 130 out of 371 candidates announced so far. Of the remaining 32 seats in the House of 403, the party has decided to give 18 seats to two allies —Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharat Samaj Party. The two parties are backed by backward castes and most of their seats are likely to go to non-Yadav OBCs.
 
 Party sources said state women’s wing chief Swati Singh, who had waged a war against BSP supremo  , will make her poll debut from Sarojininagar in Lucknow or Ballia (Sadar).
