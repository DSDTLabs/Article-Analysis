Pune: Altogether 26 smartphones and 48 watches, total worth Rs 1.28 lakh, was   from a mobile shop at Sasanenagar in Hadapsar after breaking open the shutter lock on Saturday night.

 The theft came to light when owner Swapnil Khilor (30) from Sasanenagar came to open the shop “Brand 78 Venture” around 9am on Sunday.
 
 Hadapsar police’s assistant inspector Sandip Deshmane on Monday said, “The thief broke the side locks of the shutter with a sharp object because it did not have a central security lock. He stole phones and watches from the counter and fled with the booty.”
 
 He said, “The shop does not have CCTV cameras. We are in the process of checking cameras at other shops to establish identity of the suspect.”
 
 Investigations have revealed that the thief hid himself behind the flex board in such a manner that he was not visible from outside. This helped him steal goods from the shop, he stated.
 
 Khilor has registered an FIR under sections of the Indian Penal Code. “We are checking criminals on record and working on certain clues. We hope to detect the case at the earliest,” Deshmane added.
