NAGPUR: Taking the ‘Clean   River’ campaign a step further, the Akola district administration plans to use National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s ( ) patented technology of   wastewater treatment to protect the heritage river and develop it on the lines of Sabarmati riverfront project. The technology uses specific plants to absorb nutrients directly from waste water.

 The river cleaning campaign, initiated by Akola district collector Astik Kumar Pandey on January 13, has reached halfway, with more than 50% of the river being free of waste and weed, informed sub-divisional officer Sanjay Khadse, who is also the project’s nodal officer.
 
 As reported by TOI earlier, many major and minor drains meet the river at different points. As a pilot experiment, to ensure that only clean water enters Morna, the administration will be setting up phytorid wastewater treatment plant at one of the major drains. “To make sure that sewage water does not pollute the river again, we are seeking Neeri’s technical expertise. As an experiment, the plant will be first installed at a major drain, where raw waste water will be treated,” said   of Akola Municipal Corporation.
 
 Neeri has reportedly set up over 100 such plants all over the country. Developed by Neeri director Rakesh Kumar, the first plant (35,000 litres per day) was set up at the   campus of   in 2006. Ritesh  , principal scientist at Centre for Strategic Urban Management, and director’s technical cell, recently visited Akola to inspect the site. “This technology involves a constructed wetland exclusively designed for treatment of municipal, urban, agricultural and industrial wastewater. The organic solution is removed by bacteria and the nutrients are absorbed by specific plants,” he said. 
 
 According to Neeri, the plant uses porous media such as crushed bricks, gravel and stones for filtration. “To avoid choking, we do not use soil. The quality of treated water is excellent, it meets the prescribed and amended norms of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB),” added Vijay.
 
 Though the detailed project report (DPR) of   is under preparation, the administration will shell out around Rs25 lakh for implementing this technology. “This includes the patent, plant and construction cost,” officials said.
 
 The administration wants to develop Morna on the lines of Sabarmati riverfront, said Vinayak Koundanay, adviser to Akola Municipal Corporation. “We have carried out a topographic survey and are brainstorming on various development aspects,” he said.
