Jaipur: The Karauli police have decided to carry out the   analysis test of the accused involved in the kidnapping and alleged murder of 9-year-old boy Naitik Bansal.

 District SP Anil Kayal told TOI that the police have obtained the permission from a court to carry out the narco test on the accused Ram Singh, who police claimed killed the minor boy.
 
 Naitik Bansal was allegedly kidnapped by Singh from former’s Hindaun Gate located house on February 25. The police later arrested Singh who worked near his father’s shop. The accused reportedly told cops that he abducted the child and killed him before throwing his body into thick jungles of Langra.
 
 The police had found the boy’s trouser and some blood spots from the spot but could not recover the body. “We collected samples from the spots, including blood and hairs. These samples have been sent for DNA examination at FSL to confirm if it belonged to Naitik Bansal itself,” Kayal told TOI.
 
 The cops had been carrying out extensive combing operation in the jungles of Karuali to track down the boy’s body, but in vain. The official had suspected that the accused had killed boy at some other place, and dumped body inside thick jungle to mislead the investigation.
 
 “The narco test will be conducted on the accused to ascertain what exactly he did with the body. It will also help us recreate the crime scene Ab-initio with specific location details,” an official informed TOI on the condition of anonymity.
 
 The mystery surrounding Naitik Bansal has become a tough nut to crack for the police. The cops initially arrested the accused and declared it a murder following interrogation with the accused. The cops also collected circumstantial evidence including a purported CCTV of the accused in which Sing is driving to jungle on his bike with Naitik ridding pillion.
 
 The police, however, could not recover the body due to which relatives of the boy staged protest and called for rallies.
