The first doubt anyone would ask when they hear director   who is a close friend of actor   roped in his former wife   for his upcoming movie,   would be won't it affect his friendship with Dileep. 

 He said casting Manju will not affect their relationship. "Manju playing Madhavikutty will not bring any issues in my friendship with Dileep. 
 He is not a person who approaches cinema with such a sense," Kamal added. 
 
 Kamal added that it was not just the facial resemblance that made him cast Manju in Aami, but the resemblance she has with Madhavikutty in her behaviour and mannerisms. Aami is based on Madhavikutty's autobiography, My Story. The film will go on floors on March 20.
