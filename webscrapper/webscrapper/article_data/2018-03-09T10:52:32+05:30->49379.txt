PANAJI: Two months ago, the high court of Bombay at Goa had come down heavily on government agencies for failing to dispose off construction   dumped along roads and highways. The public works department (PWD) has now identified 13 locations across Goa, next to highways and state roads, to dump such debris.

 PWD principal chief engineer U P Parsekar in his order said that the “issue of rampant and haphazard disposal of construction debris” is “uncontrolled” and is resultantly leading to environmental issues and safety aspects.
 
 “Government, considering the need, is making available vacant spaces by the sides of national highways and state roads where land is available and has been acquired for road widening but has still not been utilized for the purpose,” Parsekar said, adding that the assistant engineer specified for each of the identified sites has to be intimated before dumping the debris at the site.
 
 “It shall be ensured that only construction debris is allowed and not any garbage/obnoxious materials,” Parsekar said.
 
 The order states that the government reserves the right to discontinue with the dumping at a particular location if the need so arises and if it is creating a nuisance.
 
 The PWD has notified the public about the construction debris sites. 
 
 In an order about a decade ago, the high court had issued detailed directions to local bodies and the government to ensure a condition in the construction licence for eco-friendly disposal of construction debris, to monitor this activity and also identify sites for temporary disposal of the  .
