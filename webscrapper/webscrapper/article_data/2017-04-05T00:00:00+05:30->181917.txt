It’s been two years since Premam released which catapulted its debutante heroine   to heights of fame. While she has ventured into Telugu, she is yet to have a release in Tamil, her mother tongue. But it seems, finally her first project in Tamil will soon take off, with director Vijay at the helm of affairs. 

 Vijay says, “Yes, I am doing a film with Sai, but can’t speak about it yet. I should have more details about it in place in another week’s time.” Earlier, it was reported that they were teaming up for the Tamil version of Charlie, but this is a different film.
 
 Sai, who has been busy shooting for the Sekhar Kammula film Fidha in Telugu, is on a break now and wasn’t available for comment. “She is away with friends in Manali, and should be back in a week’s time,” says a source close to the actress.
