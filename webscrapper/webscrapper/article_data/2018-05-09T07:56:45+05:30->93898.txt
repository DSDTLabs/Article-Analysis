 (JAIPUR): Rescued in 2007 from a coal mine in Koderma (Jharkhand), then a nine-year-old Mohammed   (21 at present) has fought all odds to have completed his BSC in life science from  . The extreme poverty has pushed him to work at the MICA mine at the age of seven. He worked for 12 hours a day deep below 200-300 metres in extremes of temperature. 

 Recalling the horror, Ansari, who came Bal Ashram at Viratnagar where he has spent six years, says that day starts at dawn while walking towards the mine which was 8 km. “My jobs is to collect the MICA from the mines and to sell it in the black market in the evening. Almost 100 children use to work in extreme conditions. During summers the temperature inside the mine goes up to over 50 centigrades as we go deep down up to 300 metres,” said Ansari.
 
 Living without water connection, power, school, and hospital in Dhorakola Village, Ansari accepted his fate as his destiny until one afternoon,   activists rescued them. The challenge for the activist was that they had no place to shift the freed children. They brought them at Bal Ashram at Viratnagar. 
 
 He soon took over the horror suffered at the mine and started participating in all activities. For a year he was given an informal education at the Ashram. He impressed everyone by his learning outcome which the local school found him suitable to admit in class V. “I scored 70% in class X and 73% in class XII,” said Ansari. He was shortlisted to attend a program in the Washington, US in class VIII, but unfortunately, he was denied VISA.
 
 An avid speaker and debator participated in a Trust Women conference in London in 2014. He shared a model to eliminate child labor in the conference. “My interest lies in forensic science. I have applied for some colleges in India and abroad. He is hoping to get admission offer letter from some prestigious institutes,” said Ansari.
 
 He hopes to bring a change in the life of children of his region.
