ROHTAK: A day ahead of BJP’s ‘Hunkar Rally’ at Pandu Pindara village of   district on Thursday, Haryana chief minister   rode a bike to the venue on Wednesday to oversee the arrangements.

 The BJP rally, which will be addressed by party president   , is seen as the start of election campaign by ruling the party in the state in view of the 2019 general and assembly polls. Addressing media persons in Jind, Khattar said everyone had the right to express themselves in a democratic setup and to oppose a political outfit’s public event was a wrong precedent. 
 
 Evading questions regarding the boycott of rally by BJP’s   MP   Saini, Khattar said all leaders had been invited to reach Jind with their supporters on motorcycles. Asked about the reason for holding the rally in Jind, he said the area was in the heart of the state, had lots of open space and many historical rallies had already taken place there.
 
 Meanwhile, Hisar range inspector general of police (IGP) Sanjay Singh has appealed to the people not to release black balloons in the air as it may cause security issues for the chopper in which VVIPs including Shah would to arrive to address the rally. He said the deployment of paramilitary and state police personnel had been done in an appropriate manner and strict action would be taken against those who take law into their hands.
 
 Meanwhile, Rohtak district administration imposed Section 144 (banning assembly of more than four persons) of Code of Criminal Procedure in the district on Tuesday night in the wake of tension following a call by All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti to disrupt the BJP rally and celebration of ‘Balidan Diwas’ on February 18 in the district.
