CHANDIGARH: There was high drama at   in Sector-44 here on Thursday, after about 100 parents gathered outside the school protesting against the  , for almost three to four hours. Parents alleged that the school hiked its fee by more than 10%, demanding an explanation from the school authorities, and requested for a meeting, which was turned down at first.

 The parents also demanded that the school share details of school expenses. Some parents have also written to the director, School Education. The parents also sought the support of the   (CPA) before the protest. CPA president Nitin Goyal said: "When parents asked the school management whether the school was being run as a charity for which the cheap land was allotted, and whether they shared their profit-and-loss account and other financial details under the  's mandatory disclosure, the school management arrogantly replied to the parents that it was none of their business. Hence, parents are now going to challenge the fee hike in court, and will make sure the school's books of accounts come in the public domain. CPA has adopted a zero-tolerance approach on the commercial practices of private schools."
 
 The school's principal, Monica Chawla, said: "Our parents had certain apprehensions about the fee in the coming session, which were duly addressed and they left satisfied."
