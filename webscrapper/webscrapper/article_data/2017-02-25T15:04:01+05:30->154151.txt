 Review: Starting out on an energetic note, the albumâ€™s first song ticks all the right boxes. Kadhiley Kadhiley sung by   himself. The catchy chorus and engaging lyrics are enough to carry the song and the guitar solos elevate the song further. Sweekar Agasthya croons for Aa Chandamama, a feel-good song with infectious latin grooves. The instrumentation on the track is top notch with the flute and guitar interludes adding character to the song. The melodic vibe of the album continues with Guchi Guchi sung by Anjana Soumya and Anudeep, and the song impresses because of its beautiful chorus. The vocalists soft and dreamy voice complement the song well. Surendranath and   team up for Rangadeva and the song is a fusion of mass and RnB vibes.   is an out-and-out mass number sung by   and Sahithi Chaganti. The track is high on energy, catchy interludes and groovy beats; a potential hit. The last song Hey Sairam sung by Saketh has a devotional vibe and the album ends on a high. With more than a couple of potential hits, this album is a winner.
