Tirunelveli: A Tirunelveli court on Monday convicted a man of murdering a five-year-old boy who was his neighbourâ€™s son. The quantum of punishment for the convict, Arumugam, would be announced on Tuesday. 

 Police sources said that Tharun, a UKG student, lived with his parents Esakiappan and Prema. Arumugam and his wife got separated and the former suspected that Prema was the reason behind it as she and his wife used to interact quite often. Arumugam also had arguments with Prema over the issue. 
 
 On September 8, 2016, Arumugam lay in wait with a machete to kill Prema who had gone to pick up the boy from school. Tharun got down from the van and was heading home when Arumugam attacked him and the woman with the weapon, leaving the boy dead in a pool of blood. Prema was rushed to the Tirunelveli Government Medical College and Hospital where she was in intensive care for many days before being discharged. Meanwhile, Pettai police registered a case and booked Arumugam for murder and attempt to murder. He was arrested and lodged in the Palayamkottai central prison. The case was tried before the first additional district court at the end of which he was convicted.
