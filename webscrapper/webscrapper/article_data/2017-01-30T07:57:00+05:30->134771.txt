NEW DELHI: Relief from severe congestion may be in sight for budget airline flyers at IGI Airport’s  .   has told   ( ) that it is ready to shift its domestic flights to the 1982-era built Terminal 2, which was mothballed in 2010 when T3 became operational.

 Currently, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir operate from T1. “We have told DIAL to shift us to Terminal 2 and make that an all-IndiGo terminal. We have also given them the option to keep us fully at Terminal 1 and shift all others to T2 as we are okay with both, but need all our domestic operations under one roof for the sake of passenger convenience,” said an IndiGo official.
 
 Terminal 2 has been refurbished and can be made operational without much delay.
 
 India’s largest low cost carrier (LCC) with over 40% market share in domestic travel, IndiGo had earlier made it clear to DIAL that it opposed splitting domestic flights between T1 and T2.
 
 Sources said that a decision may soon be taken with DIAL calling a meeting with three LCCs later this week. The airport operator has not spelt out what it will do but is reportedly not averse to giving T2 to IndiGo.
 
 However, with a fleet of 126 aircrafts; 155 daily domestic departures and as many arrivals in Delhi alone and 414 more planes on order, T2 may not be big enough to meet the traffic flow IndiGo will generate in the coming years.
 
 DIAL may, therefore, have to shift the other LCCs to T2. SpiceJet and GoAir together have 71 planes in their fleet and with more than 300 on order. SpiceJet has 51 arrivals and as many domestic departures from Delhi everyday while the figure for GoAir is 32. None of the three LCCs favour splitting domestic operations between T1 and T2.
 
 Apart from passenger convenience, T1 needs to be decongested so that its expansion work can begin. The aviation ministry had last year cleared a revised master plan for IGI under which it will get its fourth runway and Terminal 4.
