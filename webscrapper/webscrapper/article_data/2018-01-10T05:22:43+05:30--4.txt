MUMBAI:   resident  , 42, was arrested on Tuesday evening on charges of harbouring and sheltering the owners of 1Above restobar, wanted in the   fire case.

 The N M   police, probing the fire, detained Karia and put him through sustained interrogation. “1Above partners Jigar and Kripesh Sanghvi and Abhjieet Mankar had gone to Karia’s house in Mankar’s   after the fire. They left it there and asked him to take care of it. Then the trio fled,” said a police officer.
 
 Investigators said though Karia knew about the deadly fire, he provided shelter to the accused and did not inform the police about their whereabouts. The cops have seized Mankar’s car from Karia’s residence. They are going through the call data records of the accused and Karia to see if they made any contact with him.
 
 A senior police officer said: “We added section 216 of the IPC (harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered) in the first FIR of the fire case and arrested Karia. He will be produced before the Bhoiwada court on Wednesday.”
 
 Before the arrest,   claimed Karia has been in touch with bookies who have been arrested by the police in the past. “I have the call data records of one bookie and it shows he has been in touch with Karia. The fire tragedy is not as simple as it seems. Karia’s background needs to be checked to understand why the accused left their vehicle with him. What are his connections that the accused trusted him to give protection?”
