CHANDIGARH: Hoping to take on BJP with some social engineering,  's main opposition party, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has joined hands with BSP for the upcoming   and assembly elections in 2019. 

 "People have faith in  . Let change begin from Haryana," said senior INLD leader   while announcing the alliance on Wednesday. "Both the parties are determined to champion the cause of the Dalits, farmers and the labour class. It is time for change and we have joined hands to ensure divisive forces like BJP can be restrained from power."
 
 Abhay claimed that the alliance laid the foundation of third front, which would be contest the next parliamentary polls under the leadership of BSP supremo Mayavati as prime ministerial candidate.
 
 He, however, refused to comment on whether INLD would continue its alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), an NDA partner.
 
 "While   is guilty of massive corruption, BJP has left no stone unturned to lead the country towards violent inter-community and communal conflicts to polarise society," he added. "It is imperative that all forces representing the downtrodden, suppressed, farming and labour classes join hands to keep them away from power."
 
 Senior BSP leader,  , who is party in-charge of five states, shared the stage with Abhay and said that exploitation of Dalits, the labour class, farmers, youth and women in the present regime has forced them to join hands with INLD.
 
 Terming the alliance like "brother-sister" relationship, Abhay said that the decision on seat-sharing would be taken just before parliamentary and state assembly elections. "Our relation would be like 'Raksha Bandhan' which reflects the unconditional love between brother and sister," Abhay said. "Our alliance would demoralise both Congress and BJP."
 
 It was also resolved that the BSP will lend its wholehearted support to INLD's 'jail bharo' agitation in support of constructing the Setluj-Yamuna Link canal, beginning on May 1.
