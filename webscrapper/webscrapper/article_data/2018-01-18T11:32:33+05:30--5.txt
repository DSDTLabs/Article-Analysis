Good yield and climbable height of trees have turned the attention of   to hybrid coconut cultivation in   district. Authorities from agriculture department said there was a good demand for the hybrid coconut seedlings, particularly the tall and dwarf cross variety. Farmers said raising the hybrid varieties required less manpower, water and cost.

 Despite a considerable number of coconut trees are falling due to water shortage, the interest in raising coconut trees among the farmers as well as the general public has not gone down. 
 
 The   at   has been catering to the needs of farmers in Trichy, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Karur and   districts. "Two types - tall and tall and dwarf cross â€“ of varieties have been raised here. Of the two, the hybrid has a good demand from farmers. Within four to five years, the plant will start giving yield and it would continue for 30 years", said deputy director of agriculture (state schemes) Santhanakrishnan. 
 
 The hybridisation technique in tall and dwarf involves crossing a tall coconut variety with a dwarf variety. This would minimise the height of the tree to 30-40 feet, making it climbable as a tall variety grows at least double this height, he said. This variety requires less manpower and if we adapt drip irrigation we can also minimise water usage, he said.
 
 "Off late climbing tall trees to pluck coconut is becoming difficult due to the lack of adequate climbers. Tall trees would take seven to eight years for flowering while the cross variety starts bearing flowers in four years", he added.
