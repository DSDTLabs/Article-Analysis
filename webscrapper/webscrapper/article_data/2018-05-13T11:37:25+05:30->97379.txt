TIRUVANNAMALAI: Falling prey to the month-long rumours that fanned paranoia of child lifters on the loose, residents of   and neighbouring villages in   panchayat resorted to lynching.

 
 Villagers said the situation went out of control when they (victims) tried to speed away in the car, increasing their suspicions that they were ‘child lifters’.
 
 According to villagers, the group came in a car and stopped at a point, where the mud road split into two. One of the occupants of the car got down and asked for a temple in the vicinity. At the same time, one of the men in the car gave chocolates to  , 4, and  , 3, daughters of Siva of Jamankulam. On seeing this, the children’s grandmother got scared and slapped the man for giving chocolates to the children. She accused them of being ‘child lifters’. The elderly woman raised an alarm and ran towards the village. It created a panic. “I advised one of the victims to immediately leave the village as the situation was turning tense. But they were stopped at Athimur and attacked,” said  , who is in her late 50s.
 
 Baby, mother of three children, said that there were rumours for over a month that child lifters were on the prowl. “We were scared to leave behind our children since then. We take our children to where ever we go,” said Baby, whose husband   was arrested along with 25 others a day after the May 9 lynching.
 
 Kanniyammal, in her 60s, said that she sent back her two grandchildren, who came for summer holidays three weeks ago. “I don’t want to put my grandchildren in danger by keeping them with me,” she said.
