PATNA: Acting president of   Pradesh   Committee (BPCC) Kaukab   on Tuesday said the   and JD (U) “insulted” Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief and Union minister Upendra Kushwaha by not joining his human chain for educational reforms in the state.

 “Kushwaha had wholeheartedly supported the human chain event on January 21 organised by the   government against dowry and child marriage. The cold response of the BJP and JD (U) to the human chain held by Kushwaha on Tuesday was a strong message to the RLSP leader to rethink his continuance in the NDA,” Quadri said.
 
 He added, “Today's incident was not a fluke. It vindicates RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh’s claim that Kushwaha is uneasy in the BJP-led alliance in Bihar. The people of Bihar have taken note of the indifference shown towards him by his own alliance partners.”
 
  said Kushwaha would be supported by the Congress once he leaves NDA.
