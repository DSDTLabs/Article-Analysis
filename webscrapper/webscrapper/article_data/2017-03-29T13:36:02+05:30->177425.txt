Mirror had earlier reported about Pakistani singer   doing playback for  's upcoming film, ' '. The song was recorded early last year, much before tensions between India and Pakistan intensified following the Uri attacks, so director   decided to re-work the lyrics as the film near pre-release promotions. Rahat, unsure about procuring a visa to India, met him in Dubai last month to re-record the song. Now, we hear that the film's team is unsure about the final version of the song's video that features Rahat and are planning to go ahead with just the song that will now have clips of Raveena from the film.
Producer  , when contacted, confirms the news, saying, “The song rendered by Rahat, titled “Zindagi Ae Zindagi“, is an emotional track about Raveena's character's journey as a mother. We made certain changes in the lyrics and Rahat was very co-operative. He is like a sutradhar of the song that conveys the feel of the film.“
 
 What about the video that the singer shot for? “It was meant to be a part of the promotions but we are yet to decide if we will use it or go ahead with the one featuring Raveena's scenes,“ Rizvi signs off.
