KOCHI: A voice clip raising concern over abduction of children from someone who identified himself as   assistant commissioner   has been doing the rounds on social media—just another example of how scaremongers have been sparking panic by spreading hoax messages using names of police officers.

 In the wake of such fear mongering, the   police information centre has now decided to streamline official content sharing on  .
 
 According to a spokesperson with the information centre, police officers will be discouraged from using their personal social media profiles to spread official information like details of absconders or missing persons.
 
 “The aim is to make official handles more active. Official handles of the state police chief has been giving authentic updates. Profiles like that of city police commissioners and district police chiefs should be used to pass on information so that people would be able to share them without doubt. The plan is also to stop people from spreading hoax messages in the name of police officers,” said a senior officers with the information centre.
 
 Cybercell officials said only authentic information can counter the spreading of rumours. “Many may not personally know the officers in whose names such statements are issued. Hence, fake messages can be spread. Officers should make use of official handles of senior officials to spread vital information,” said ES Bijumon, an official with the cybercell. “It is quite hard to track down the source on WhatsApp. Those who want to share such messages should contact the cyber cell and verify the message before forwarding them,” said Bijumon.
 
 Laljy said people shouldn’t believe such hoax messages as it is highly unlikely for officers to post them on their own. “Though I have social media accounts, I won’t be posting official messages through these accounts. People who want to keep track of such information can follow the city police commissioner’s handle,” he said.
