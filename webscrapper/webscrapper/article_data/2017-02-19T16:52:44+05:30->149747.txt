NEW DELHI: The German Air Force scrambled two fighter jets for a   flight after the Cologne air traffic control could not establish contact with the Indian aircraft due to a reported communication failure.

  The Boeing-777 was flying from Mumbai to London on Thursday (February 16) as 9W-118 and was overflying close to the German city Cologne when its cockpit crew did not respond to ATC communications.
 
 With no response from the Indian aircraft, German Air Force scrambled jets to escort the Jet aircraft. However, these planes managed to establish an intercept contact following which the Jet pilots established contact with the ATC. Once the communication was restored, the aircraft (VT-JEX) continued its flight to London.
 
 A Jet Airways spokesperson confirmed the scare over German skies and that the crew of flight 9W-118 have been grounded. 
 
 “Contact between Jet Airways flight 9W 118, from Mumbai to London Heathrow, of February 16, 2017, and the local ATC, was briefly lost while flying over German airspace. Communication was safely restored within a few minutes. As a precaution, the German Air Force deployed its aircraft to ensure the safety of the flight and its guests. The flight with 330 guests and 15 crew subsequently landed at London without incident. Jet Airways has duly reported the matter to the concerned authorities including the DGCA. As part of the standard process, the flight crew of 9W 118 has been de-rostered pending investigation,” a statement by Jet Airways said.
