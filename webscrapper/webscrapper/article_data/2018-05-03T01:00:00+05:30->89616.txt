 is excited about reprising Farida Jalal’s role from Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham ('K3G') for Ekta Kapoor’s TV show — adapted from the film — 'Dil Hi  '. It’s of course, one of Farida Dadi’s favourite roles. The happiness, however, is more because she and Farida   are best friends in real life.
An elated Farida Dadi said, “I have known Farida (Jalal) for 40 years now. She used to earlier live in Bandra, opposite Saira Banu’s house; we are a happy group of friends, including Farida, Sairaji and Waheedaji (Waheeda Rahman).” 
  Dadi is also currently seen on the show 'Laado 2'. Ask her if she will be able to juggle both the shows and she replied, “The track of 'Laado 2' is shifting to Veerpur and I am not a part of that track. So, it won’t demand a lot of times from me. I am looking forward to 'Dil Hi Toh Hain' now.”
