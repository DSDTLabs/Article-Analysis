NAGPUR: The Nagpur District Under-25 selection chess tournament which concluded at the NDCA hall of Dhanwatey National College attracted just 28 players from across the city.

 The oldest participants in the meet are a couple of 16-year-olds while handful of nine-year-olds complete the line-up. At 16, Aditi   and   are the top two seeded and the oldest participating players. 2008-born Aditya Bodkhe and   are the youngest competitors in the tourney, which was open for players born on of after 1-1-1992.
 
 The indifferent attitude of senior city chess players towards the meet is quite surprising. The tournament is important because four top players here will earn the right to represent Nagpur district in the U-25 state meet. The organizers, however, claim that this is a usual trend in higher age category tournaments.
 
 Secretary of the Nagpur District Chess Association, KK Barat told TOI, "We got three more entries this time. Last year we got just 25 entries compared to this year's 28. Since the examination season is on, entries are usually restricted especially in the higher age category tournaments."
 
 With no prize money and no chance to gain rating points from the selection tourney, the players usually skip the district event. Elaborating the reasons one of the senior most arbiters in the city,   said, "Since most of the players with good rating points are allowed to participate directly in the state competitions they avoid playing against young masters."
 
 In the Under-19 district event too the organizers are not expecting much participation. They, however, are confident of attracting more entries in the lower age category championships. "Like we had over 80 entries in the recently held Under-13 championship, we are aware that we will get more than 100 entries in the forthcoming Under-15 district selection tournament,"   said.
