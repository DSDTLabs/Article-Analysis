 I like spaces with strong clean lines. I try to pull the outdoor into these boxes we call homes and there should be a certain whimsy to a space that reflects the personality of the people who live in it.
 
 
 
 I personally feel, while we give a lot of attention to other rooms, bath spaces are often overlooked and that makes most of us stick to the usual whites and chromes. In fact, there is so much you could do in terms of colours, finishes and technology. One must change the perception and open their eyes to new aesthetic possibilities. Balancing functionalities with aesthetics is key. I hope aspirational Indian consumers introduce coloured products into their bath spaces with confidence.
 
 
 When adding any accent colours, I’d recommend a neutral palette for the rest of the bathroom. Some combinations work well, whether its techniques like colour blocking.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 There’s a huge plus if your walls are bright hued. Try accessorising it with designer vessel sinks.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 I would recommend adding elements of interest like plants or accessories to make a small space interesting. For a small bathroom, small fixtures would be ideal.
 
 
 
 It’s my shower area that faces the sea.
