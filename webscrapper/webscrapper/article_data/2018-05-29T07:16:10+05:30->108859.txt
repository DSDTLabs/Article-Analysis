PUNE: A giant snake knocked out power for more than five hours in   on Monday.

 
 The pesky reptile invaded a 22KV feeder pillar of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd near Khadakwasla Sub Station around 9.35 am.
 
 
  
 However, the serpent’s dalliance with the pillar did not last long as it not only got electrocuted in the process but also left in its wake a short circuit and several-hour-long outage.
 
 Around 12,000 residents in DSK Vishwa, Kolewadi, Nanded Gaon and parts of Dhayari on   were affected by power failure.
 
 A statement issued by the distribution company said that two 22 V supply lines from the 220 KV Parvati Sub Station supply power to Khadakwasla Sub Station. One supply line going from Khadakwasla sub-station supplies power to DSK sub-station. On Monday, around 9.35 am, power supply from one supply line was disrupted which affected two outgoing supply lines, one of which transmits power to three DSK sub-stations. This, in turn, led to power failure in areas that are fed by the sub-station.
 
 After patrolling the area for 45 minutes, the power utility staff members were able to identify the 22 V feeder pillar that caused power failure. “Upon inspection, we found a huge snake stuck inside the pillar. Repairs were undertaken and completed by 2.55 pm and power supply of all the five supply lines was restored,” the statement added.
