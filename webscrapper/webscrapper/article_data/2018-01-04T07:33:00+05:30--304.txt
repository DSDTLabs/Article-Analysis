Chandigarh: The road signs beside a Sector-45 bus stop were unnecessary earlier but now these are just twisted iron and an eyesore.

 These ‘zebra crossing’ and ‘bicycle track’ signs have remained tilted for weeks at the mouth of a bicycle track along the Sector 44-45 dividing road but no one has cared to replace these. “People can see both the zebra crossing as well as the bicycle track, and they’d don’t need any signs at all. The junk spoils the look of City Beautiful,” said Mayank Kapoor, a nearby resident. “The sign doesn’t say if the bicycle track is open to pedestrians as well.”
 
 Tread the bicycle track and you hit several broken patches that trouble the cyclists and rickshaw-pullers. This is where the road has weathered but not been re-carpeted. “Even if authority concerned remembers to care about the main road, they still forget to repair the bicycle tracks,” said a passerby.
 
 Domestic waste has accumulated at various spots along the road, mainly near the curve and along a boundary wall. The people who live nearby discard their plastic waste and vegetable peels on the bicycle track near the bus stop.
