NEW DELHI: The Delhi government wants the much-delayed   in situ rehabilitation project to be transferred to the   on the same terms it was awarded to a private developer. It plans to write to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry, LG   and   in this regard.

 The move comes in the backdrop of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s note to LG — as reported by TOI on Friday — seeking transfer of slum clusters on DDA land to Delhi government to enable “in-situ-rehabilitation”. DDA is, meanwhile, preparing for the inauguration of construction work in the Kathputli project: the issue could well turn into another flashpoint in the state-Centre relationship. On Friday, a high-level ministerial meeting at Delhi secretariat revolved around a discussion on this matter. 
 
 There is a view within the cabinet that the Kathputli project is nothing short of a “scam” where 13 acres of land was given away to a private developer in 2009 for just Rs 6.11 crore. The ministers at the meeting opined this was way lower than the prevailing market rate, and that land prices would have gone up manifold since then. The government has questioned the cost-effectiveness of the project as well. DDA officials said the project was in conformity with the DUSIB policy for slum rehabilitation. They said it had already been decided by the ministry and LG that while DDA would carry out rehabilitation work of slums on the central government and its land, DUSIB will be responsible for work on the Delhi government land.
 
 DDA officials said all occupants had been shifted either to transit camps, or were given flats in Narela. “There are 3,336 eligible allottees so far. While 2,800 will be given flats at the site, the rest have been given flats in Narela as per the DUSIB policy,” an official said. Work on two other slum rehabilitation projects is on in   and Jailorwala Bagh. “At Kalkaji, 3,000-odd flats are in advance stage of construction. At  , we are building 1,700 flats,” the official said.
