GURUGRAM: A pipeline burst near   on   on Thursday morning, causing waterlogging in the area and leading to traffic snarls on the 16-lane DLF-Huda Expressway.   officials said the water pipeline burst when workers were carrying out construction work on the high-speed corridor.

 Residents said they had a tought time commuting to work because of waterlogging near the busy intersection. “Both the service lane and main carriageway of the expressway got flooded. Two cars even broke down in the slush. But cops helped in pulling the cars out,” said Navdeep, a  .
 
 Roshini Talwar, another commuter, said, “Traffic congestion has become a regular affair at Genpact Chowk. For the past few days, the problem has been due to the non-operational underpass. Now the water pipeline burst has made the situation worse. As there was traffic congestion in the morning and afternoon, office-goers like me had to face problems.”
 
 The problem was, however, resolved within a couple of hours as Haryana chief minister   is likely to visit the city. 
 
 “I think that’s the reason why the pipeline was repaired so quickly. Otherwise, the Genpact Chowk has become a major traffic congestion point on Golf Course Road,” said Siddharth, another commuter and a local resident.
 
 Huda officials said the pipeline was repaired within a few hours. “We got information about leakage in a water pipeline due to the ongoing construction work on Golf Course Road. We immediately sent the technical staff and the pipeline was repaired. The situation is completely under control now,” said an official.
