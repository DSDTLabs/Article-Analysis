KOLKATA:   has decided to work towards social causes. To begin with, it has undertaken a slum community service project.

 On Monday, Syndicate — the highest administrative decision-making body of   — resolved to start a community service project involving residents of 28/1Giribabu Lane slum under ward 44.
 
 CU vice-chancellor   said, “We have decided to start community service as we are moving towards achieving excellence in higher education. Yet, we found that in the nearby slums, financially backward students are trying to find assistance in academics. In a society, collective effort is needed to uplift the backward.”
 
 The students in the slum will be provided educational support. They will get books and will be helped with their homework. They will be given tips on basic health amenities and regular health checkups will be conducted in the area.
 
 The students will also be provided clothes twice a year and will be taken for excursions every year. Food will be distributed twice a week by the university. CU has also decided to take the students for pandal-hopping during Durga Puja.
 
 “Four students will be selected based on interviews to be associated with the project. They shall be paid a stipend of Rs 2,000 every month. This will be a programme to reach out. The equilibrium, otherwise, cannot be maintained in the society,” said the CU vice-chancellor.
 
 The CU-selected students will hold special classes for the students in the slum at a local school after 12 noon.
