SHILLONNG: The   in   under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Guarantee Act ( ) in Meghalaya in 2014-15 was 42.53%, which is higher than the mandated 33%, a report tabled by state minister for community and rural development S Dhar revealed in the assembly on Wednesday. 

 "The income earned by women has greatly helped them in meeting their family needs," the report said. He added that MGNREGA continues to be a torch-bearer for rural development in the state.
 
 "The creation of durable and sustainable assets has benefited villagers - a change they yearned for years. Footpaths, footbridges, roads, community washing facilities, water conservation, land development, playgrounds and household latrines have been a boon for people," it pointed out.
 
 The state could achieve 167.34 lakh person days of work with an average of 47.65 person days per household, the report said. It, however, added that the programme suffered due to continuous inadequacy of funds since the 2013-14 financial year. "During the course of the year, efforts were made to have continuous engagement with the Union ministry of rural development for improving availability of funds," the report said.
 
 "Efforts were made to make people aware of the expanded list of works and there was focus on national resource management activities, including water-harvesting structures," the report said. It added that the   continues to redress the grievances received from the beneficiaries, NGOs and individuals pertaining to the implementation of the scheme.
 
 "It was observed that complaints at the state level have drastically reduced over the years. Efforts are being made to ensure that the grievances are redressed in time and action taken," the report added.
