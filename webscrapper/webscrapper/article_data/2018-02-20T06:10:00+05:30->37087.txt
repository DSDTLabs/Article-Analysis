AURANGABAD:   accused   on Monday praised Prime Minister   for "acche din" and said she would join politics and serve the country if she was asked to do so.

 Thakur, who is out on bail, appealed to Hindus to have more children. "It is saffron that is appealing to you to have more children for the sake of the country. This is not something which I should be saying, but something you should be thinking about," she said.
 
 Claiming that charges against her were false and fabricated, she said, "It was the conspiracy of the disbelievers to coin the term ' ' and blot the country's name at the global stage. It was the previous UPA government's conspiracy to put me behind bar and forcefully extract statements supporting its theory."
