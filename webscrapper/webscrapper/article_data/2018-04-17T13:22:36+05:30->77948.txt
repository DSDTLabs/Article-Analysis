VADODARA: A hardware trader was cheated to the tune of Rs11 lakh by a person identified as Jayesh Contractor alias Ashok Patel alias Paresh. The accused was about to be nabbed in a trap laid by the complainant  , but he managed to flee.

 Parikh, who runs a hardware trading business in Ghadiyali Pol in the old city area, had received an order in February of providing binding wire weighing around 1,600kg and 400kg of nails together worth Rs11 lakh. Parikh delivered the order near Samlaya village as per the accused’s instructions and received the payment through cheque. But when Parikh deposited the cheque, he learnt that the account of the payer was closed some time ago.
 
 Jagdish, another hardware trader, informed Parikh in March that he too had received an order from a person who identified himself as Paresh Patel to provide binding wires and nails and requested delivery in the same area. Parikh and Jagdish then made a plan to nab the accused when the delivery was being done.
 
 Police said as per the plan on April 14, when Jagdish’s deliveryman went to Tajpura to deliver the order, Parikh kept a watch. When the accused reached there on his bike along with a tempo, Parikh’s deliveryman identified him as the same person who gave him the cheque. Parikh then went near him to nab him, but seeing him the accused fled on his bike.
 
 However, they managed to nab the tempo driver Harish Vasava. He told them that the accused, who identified himself as Jayesh Contractor, had paid him Rs2,000 to collect the order and deliver it at Kalol taluka in Panchmahal. Parikh approached   police on Saturday where a case of cheating was registered.
