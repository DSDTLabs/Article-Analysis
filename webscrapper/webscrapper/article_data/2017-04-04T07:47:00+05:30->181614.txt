LUDHIANA: With the   banning liquor in all hotels, restaurants and resorts close to highways, residents have taken to organising private parties in farm houses, at homes or at private lounges where liquor can be served. 

 Karan Bagga, owner of famous club in the city, said, "It is a major loss for us. I had a live band performance in my club tonight and three of my major clients cancelled as we can't serve liquor. We don't know how we will manage. People have cancelled advance booking and have shifted their parties to private residences and farm houses. Now, people will come will just have food and listen to music."
 
 Raunik Narula, an event manager from the city, said, " In the days to come, we have planned three parties at residences and farm houses with band and DJ. People don't have an option. Any restaurant not serving drinks will suffer losses."
 
 The ruling has also jacked up the popularity of outstation trips. Ayush Jain from Agar Nagar said, "We were planning my wife's birthday party but we have cancelled the celebrations and are now heading to a resort in Kasauli." 
 
 Avneet Kochar, a city resident who was to entertain foreign guests in a club has decided to host them at his residence instead. 
 
 Amarveer, general secretary of the Hotel Association said this has come as a double whammy for the industry, which was already reeling under the effects of demonetisation. "We suffered uncertainty before and now this has aggravated the situation. Our business will suffer. We are holding a national meeting in Delhi on Tuesday. Let's see what works out."
