CHANDIGARH: Though the amended ‘Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016’ has been notified by the ministry of home affairs and sent to the education department, the same will not have any effect on fee hike in 2018-19 as the session has already begun,   officials said.

  
  
 
 However, once the regulatory committee mentioned in the policy comes into being, parents will be able to get their complaints redressed.
 
 As per the officials, there is still time before the Act is implemented in Chandigarh. It needs to be notified and printed in a gazette by the UT administration. The regulatory committee, which will be chaired by the administrator, is yet to be formed. All this will be done after the administrator finalizes the nominated members.
 
 The UT education department will also be referring to the legal remembrancer on how the complaints regarding fee hike can be dealt with.
 
 School education director Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “I had received the notification on Friday. I will forward the same to the higher authorities. Since the session has begun and the schools have already revised the fee, we will be only responding to parents’ complaints against particular schools.”
 
 He said it might take two more months for the policy to come into force.
 
 On the other hand, schools managements are up in arms against the move. ABS Sidhu, vice-president of Independent Schools Association, said, “This policy will harm quality of education in Chandigarh. The government has shown a narrow and short-sighted perspective in adopting this legislation from  . This has already been challenged in the high court.”
 
 The parents’ body has termed it a success. “The administration must implement it from the current session itself to avoid further delay. We are now going to work on plugging the loopholes in this notification to make it more effective,” said a member.
