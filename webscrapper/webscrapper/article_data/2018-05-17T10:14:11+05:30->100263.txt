NAGPUR: Many newcomers got a chance to present their vocal skills in front of live audience in a musical concert organized by cultural organization Sargam at Sai Sabhagruh, Shankar Nagar, on Wednesday. 

 The agenda of the musical bonanza was to promote new talent and preserve the singing culture at the same time, believed founder of the organization, MV Unnikrishnan. 
 
 Around 15 performers coming from various walks of life made their maiden entry into the world of singing along with some of the experienced and classical-trained bunch of artistes. There were doctors, engineers, bankers, businessmen, housewives and some professional singers. Unnikrishnan has introduced around 350 singers so far since the inception of Sargam.
 
 Ex-serviceman at Indian Air Force, Group Captain Milind Kalvit won accolades for his performance on ‘Kahi karti hogi’ song, sung originally by Mukesh. Speaking to TOI he said, “I have been performing at our official parties but I faced the civil crowd for the first time. Thankfully I did not have any stage fear and my rhythm sense was good but still the minor corrections and guidance given by professional mentors helped me improvise my singing.”
 
 Banker Roopa Meshram and engineer Isbab-ul-Hasan mesmerized the audience with their energetic duet and took them back to the 90s era. They sang a medley of ‘Odhli, chunariya’ from ‘Jab Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya’ and ‘Mere sapno ka wo raja’ from the movie ‘Hello Brother’. Hasan had a touch of Sudesh Bhosle in his voice while Roopa’s voice resembled Jaspinder Narula.
 
 Classically trained Varsha Mathur wove magic through her melodious performance on ‘Jag ghoomeya’ and ‘Lambi judai’. Her crystal clear voice and effortless singing was highly appreciated. 
 
 Banker Abhay Vyas was quite nervous before his debut performance but still gave a befitting tribute to Suresh Wadkar through his rendition ‘Aye zindagi, gale laga le’. (With inputs from Kanika Belsare)
