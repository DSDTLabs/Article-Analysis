ROHTAK: Anticipating huge gathering at the Jassia village sit-in on 'Balidan Diwas' on Sunday , the district administration has diverted Rohtakbound traffic coming from outside to routes via Kharkhodda, Lakhan Majra and Gohana.

 Except vehicles participating in Jat stir sit-in, no other traffic would ply on   from   Gol chowk till Gohana on Sunday. Rohtak deputy commissioner   said they were in constant touch with AIJASS vigilance committee to monitor the situation. Kumar said though all security arrangements were in place, the administration wanted to ensure nothing triggered panic. “That's why   has not been called. Haryana does not want to give any impression of suppressing the stir,“ he added.
 
 On the AIJASS leaders' demand to shut liquor vends on Sunday , Kumar said he was not informed of any such requests but shutting down was no solution as it causes revenue loss to the state exchequer.
