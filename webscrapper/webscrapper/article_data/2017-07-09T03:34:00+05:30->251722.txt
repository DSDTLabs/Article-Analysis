Panaji: With the Goa Seaport Private Limited taking over berths 8 and 9 for redevelopment, 90 Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) employees attached to the Mechanical Ore Handling Plant (MOHP) and other sub-divisions of the mechanical engineering department availed of the special voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) announced by MPT. The MPT management had offered VRS to 285 MOHP employees in a bid to trim down operating costs and enhance its earnings. According to MPT employees, doubts over eligibility of wage revision had created apprehension among the staff and dampened the response to the scheme. The Goa Sea Port is a subsidiary of Sterlite Ports, which in turn is a subsidiary of mining conglomerate Vedanta. Sources said MPT was mulling a similar scheme for other employees once the scheme for MOHP employees was successfully concluded. The employees who opted for VRS received 45 daysâ€™ salary as compensation for every year of service or the total of all the emoluments due to the employees, depending on whichever was lower. The last date for employees to have availed of the VRS was March 18. MPT had declared the special VRS for the employees after due approval from the Centre in December 2016 On June 30, the management held a farewell programme for the 90 employees who opted for the scheme.
