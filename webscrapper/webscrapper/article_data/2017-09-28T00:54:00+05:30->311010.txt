Coimbatore: District collector T N Hariharan on Wednesday announced a Diwali bonus of Rs 3,000 for conservancy workers and also plans to conduct health camps for those working in village and town panchayats.

 The decision was taken at a meeting that the collector held with the officials of the civic body and village and town panchayats, and representatives of SC/ST welfare associations at the district collectorate.
 
 “We requested the district collector to provide Rs 3,000 as Diwali bonus to all the conservancy workers which he agrred. We have also requested him to introduce provident fund and related salary benefits for the conservancy workers in the village and town panchayats. The collector has instructed the concerned officials to take up the issue,” S Selvakumar, member of the state SC/ST welfare committee, told TOI.
 
 Around five SC/ST welfare associations took part in the meeting. They said health camps would be organised for the conservancy workers in the municipal corporation. “If the district administration facilitates regular conduct of health camps, it will be helpful for them to keep a track of their health,” Selvakumar said.
 
 The associations have also urged the district administration to provide required equipment to the conservancy workers while cleaning the drains. “Many conservancy workers do not have these equipment. The district collector has instructed the village and town panchayat officials to make note of this,” Selvakumar said.
 
 The associations also alleged that the conservancy workers were not paid fully. “The wage is fixed at Rs 350. But most workers do not receive the full amount. The district administration has agreed to look into the matter,” Selvakumar said.
