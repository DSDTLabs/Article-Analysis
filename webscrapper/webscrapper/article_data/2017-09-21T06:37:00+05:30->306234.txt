Kolkata: A section of Rohingyas may have used Indian territory to try and enter Bangladesh before the alert along the international border. 

 According to BSF, seven Rohingyas were nabbed by Bengal Frontier earlier this year while attempting to cross over into Bangladesh. However, this was before the alert was sounded nearly a month ago, said BSF ADG (Eastern Command) R P Singh.
 
 “In 2013, we apprehended nearly 96 Rohingyas. Over the last few years, others have been apprehended. This year, the figure is seven and all of that happened before we redeployed our forces and plugged gaps. We have nearly 85,000 troops along the Indo-Bangla border. After the alert, we deployed additional manpower and equipment wherever required. Since then, there have been no incidents,” Singh said.
 
 BSF sources did not rule out the possibility that some Rohingyas who had reached Bengal after crossing over to India, possibly through Manipur and Nagaland’s porous borders with Myanmar, may still be in the state. “They could have gone into hiding with local support. There is no reason to believe only seven Rohingyas entered Bengal and tried to cross the international border,” an officer said.
 
 Singh, who was speaking on the sidelines of a curtain-raiser for a half marathon that BSF is organising in October in memory of its 1,851 martyrs since 1965, also said BSF battalions deployed along Bengal’s border with Bangladesh are now equipped with advanced equipment to check infiltration and other crimes.
