NEW DELHI: Concerned about the filth surrounding the Metro  , the urban development ministry has directed DMRC to focus on improving cleanliness in such areas and evolve an institutional mechanism for regular engagement with the large and growing number of   users.

 While chairing a review meeting on the functioning of Delhi Metro on Tuesday, urban development secretary Rajiv Gauba lauded the agency for its unwavering focus on ensuring highest standards in respect of punctuality, safety, rolling stock utilization, hygiene inside the stations, he suggested that attention needs to be given to cleanliness in the vicinity of metro stations, though it is the responsibility of civic agencies.
 
 Gauba suggested DMRC chief should have regular meetings with respective municipal commissioners and senior police officials to ensure cleanliness and hassle free entry and exit for metro users. DMRC should be forthcoming to spend more if required to enhance presentation of Metro stations surroundings, he said.
 
 Gauba also suggested that DMRC should engage the large number of Metro users on a sustained basis for making them partners in further improving the brand value of Delhi Metro and by acting promptly on user feedback to the extent feasible. He suggested an effective social media platform could be created and handled by professionals for better results.
 
 DMRC chief Mangu Singh highlighted the efforts being made to sustain the positive brand value of Delhi Metro. He said over 99% punctuality in services is being continuously maintained and there has been a 17% decline in the incidents affecting punctuality since 2014.
