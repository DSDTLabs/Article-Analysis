CHENNAI: Till Wednesday night it was business as usual for the neighbours of   and her husband, at the closely knit residential complex on South Sivan Koil Street,  . 

 But they awoke on Thursday to a murder as ghastly as it was improbable: Unknown assailants had beaten 23-year-old Ganapriya to death and had tied up her husband  , a priest at Vadapalani Sivan Koil. It appeared unbelievable that no one heard or saw anything out of the way in the compact two-storey building off 100 Feet Road.
 
 Even though the three houses on the first floor are just 6ft apart from one another, neighbours said they didn’t hear any cries of the couple. They speculated, without sounding fully convinced themselves, that the sound of the airconditioning must drowned any noise that accompanied the crime.
 
 Crumpled bedsheets, a disturbed wardrobe and blood-soaked clothes at Ganapriya’s house told a brutal tale. Neighbours watched from their balconies as police teams and forensic experts carried out their investigations.
 
 The police said though jewellery and cash was missing from the house, the murder appears to have been committed for reasons more than money. “The man always left home early, came for lunch and returned late in the night,” said  , a neighbour.
 
 “We have not seen them fighting.   kept her family affairs to herself, except for the fact that she had a love marriage, which she had informed to the house owner, while taking the house on rent,” said a neighbour on the ground floor. “We have not seen any relatives or friends visit in the past three years.”
 
 “My mother-in-law was sleeping in the hall. She usually uses the common bathroom. But on Wednesday night, she did not go out,” said  , the house owner. Gnanapriya only used to visit her neighbour’s house to play with their children. Police said it was easy to enter the building because it did not have a compound wall.
