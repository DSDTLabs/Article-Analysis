JAMSHEDPUR: The residents of the   and its adjoining surrounding suburban areas may not have to face water crisis this summer this year if the state government’s effort to ensure adequate   becomes successful.

 Minister for food, civic supplies and consumer affairs, Saryu Rai on Sunday said that people living in the non command area of Tata Steel under   (JNAC) and   (MNAC) limits will get sufficient water supply in coming months. 
 
 Sources said as many as 255 hand pumps under MNAC and 318 under JNAC will be made available by March 31. Water tankers with 12,000-litre capacity will be pressed into service to fill 5,000-litre capacity tanks that will be installed at different places under the MNAC.
 
 Rai said the state government is mulling to constitute a water regulatory board in the state for fixing monthly tariffs for drinking water supply. He also said work on 100km of pipeline under the   (PHED)’s Mango drinking water project — that aims to supply piped drinking water to 1.5 lakh beneficiaries in a phased manner — is complete. 
 
 “We will provide 17,650 new tap connections in the second phase,” said Rai.
