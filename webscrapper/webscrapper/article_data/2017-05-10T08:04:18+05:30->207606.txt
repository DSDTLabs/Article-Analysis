PUNE: The Pune rural police on Monday arrested a Mumbai-based gang that was trying to escape after abducting two farmers from Sugaon village near  .

 The Walchandnagar police have recovered two country-made pistols, 30 cartridges, Rs 2.24 lakh cash and 10 mobile phones from the seven arrested suspects. Prima facie investigations revealed that Dattu Sawant and his brother-in-law Sunil Kadale were abducted as a result of a dispute in a Khandala land deal, said assistant inspector Uttam Bhajnavale.
 
 The officer told TOI that on Monday morning, he and his team were checking vehicles on Indapur-Baramati Road. “We stopped two vehicles. The window panes of both vehicles were covered in black film and the drivers weren’t ready to roll down the window,” he said.
 
 Bhajnavale added that he and knocked on the window of the car. “When the driver tried to accelerate, I got suspicious and told our   to block vehicles.”
 
 Then, the driver was forced to roll down the window. “As soon as we looked inside the vehicle, someone sitting in the back seat screamed for help claiming he had been abducted,” Bhajnavale said.
 
 All nine occupants of the car were forced to get out. “Sawant said that the suspects abducted him and his relative from their house and they were being taken to Mumbai,” Bhajnavale said.
 
 Bhajnavale said that the complainant Sawant also works as a mediator in land dealings. Recently, he had sold a plot in Khandala to a Mumbai-based buyer.   (38) of Goregaon, Mumbai, is the main suspect in the abduction case. Sakpal also works as a mediator.
 
 The officer explained that Sakpal wanted to deal in the same piece of land in Khandala. “When he came to know that Sawant had sealed the deal, he started demanding 50% of the commission earned,” Bhajnavale said.
 
 On Monday morning, Sakpal and six accomplices, who also work as estate agents, abducted the men. 
 
 As of now, the police are probing how the suspects procured the firearms.
