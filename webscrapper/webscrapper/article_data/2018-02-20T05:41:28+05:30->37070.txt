MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed the   government to take immediate steps for constituting the   for effective implementation of provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

 A division bench of Justice N H Patil and Justice N W Sambre directed the government to file a report by March 16 on the progress made on the issue. It was hearing a PIL by NGOs ‘All India Handicapped’ and ‘Rashtriya Apang Vikas Mahasangh’ on the issue of providing facilities and amenities to the differently-abled persons.
 
 
  
 The petitioners’ lawyers informed the bench last week that the Supreme Court had in December 2017 directed all state governments and Union territories to immediately set up advisory board within three months. However, the Maharashtra government has till date not complied with the apex court order, the high court was told. Additional government pleader   told the HC that the state government has taken necessary steps towards finalisation of the scheme and that various ministries are involved in getting information for framing the scheme. “We direct the state to take urgent necessary steps to constitute the State Advisory Board within six weeks,” the court said.
 
 In its December 2017 order, the apex court had said it was every state government's duty to constitute an advisory board and in turn provide proper access to roads, transport, buildings and public places to differently-abled persons so that they could enjoy a meaningful life and contribute to the nation’s progress.
