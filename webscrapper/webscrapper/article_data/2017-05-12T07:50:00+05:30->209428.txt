Margao: Minister for town and country planning,   Sardesai, on Thursday, made a strong pitch for carving out a separate municipal council for   from the existing   Municipal Council (MMC). The Fatorda MLA mooted this idea while addressing a meeting held by him with the people of Fatorda constituency along with senior officials of various government departments at the Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex. 

 During the meeting, Sardesai attempted to redress the grievances of the people, and also reviewed the progress of various development works in his constituency. Later speaking to reporters, Sardesai said that the formation of an independent municipal body for Fatorda was just a proposal he had placed “in the public domain” and that the modalities for the exercise need to be worked out.
 
  Currently, Fatorda is part of the Margao municipality
 
 “There is no scope for development in Margao. But there is more scope for planned development in Fatorda. An independent municipality for Fatorda will lead to fast-paced development of Fatorda. The idea is open for suggestions from the public,” Sardesai said.
 
 In the 25-member MMC, 11 councillors, including chairperson Babita Prabhudessai, owe allegiance to Sardesai, elected as they were on the panel floated by the Fatorda MLA. Officials of all major government departments were present for the meeting. Chief officer of MMC, Y B Tavde, deputy collector, Uday Prabhudessai, municipal engineers, traffic police officials, were among those who attended the meeting.
