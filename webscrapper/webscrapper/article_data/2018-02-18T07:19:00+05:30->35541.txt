Ludhiana: Officials of the commercial department of Ferozepur Division of the Northern Railways have initiated a special drive to keep a tab on ticketless travellers as well as unauthorized vendors across the station. Under this drive so far, officials have issued 506 challans to various offenders caught roaming inside the trains and station premises without having any authority for the same. Railway officials have generated around rupees two lakh from offenders through fines at the time of the special drive.

 Following directions of senior authorities, a team — accompanied by senior divisional commercial manager Monu Luthra — carried out an extensive checking drive on Saturday morning in various trains passing through the Ludhiana railway station, and caught 506 violators travelling without tickets in trains, some of whom were unauthorized vendors.
 
 Luthra stated: “A special team, under the supervision of the divisional railway manager, was constituted by the Ferozepur Division authorities to carry out a special checking drive in long-route trains passing through the major stations of the Ferozepur Division, and Ludhiana was one among them. The main reason behind this checking was to counter the problem of ticketless travellers taking advantage of the rush occurring due to delay in trains, and travelling without tickets on various long routes and special trains run by the Northern Railways.”
