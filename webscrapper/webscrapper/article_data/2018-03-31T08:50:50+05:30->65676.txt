JALANDHAR: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)   and senior advocate H S   met   chief minister   Kumar in Patna on Friday to seek his party’s support for justice to victims of the November 1984 anti-Sikh riots. “He has not only assured only that he would take up the matter with   government, but would also ask his party MPs to coordinate and raise the issue in Parliament strongly,” Phoolka told TOI over the phone from Patna.

 “I explained to the CM, who has already gained respect of Sikhs of India and abroad for grand celebrations to mark the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh at Patna, of how the victims were still awaiting justice and how every effort was being made to delay and deny justice. He was keen to extend the support of his party for the cause and assured it would raise the matter at all levels, including in Parliament,” he said.
 
 Phoolka’s move may build further pressure on SAD, which has been attacking the   for denying justice but is sharing power at the Centre with   for the last four years, without any tangible result.
