CHENNAI: The `so-called' general council meet of the   convened by   and O Panneerselvam was not a general body meeting at all, according to `sacked' party deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran. Reacting to the council's decision to oust   from the general secretary's post, Dhinakaran said the validity of the resolutions passed by them would depend on the court's final order expected on October 23 or 24. Dhinakaran said he had been watching television and taken note of the resolutions passed. Only the party general secretary , or in her absence the deputy general secretary appointed by her, had the authority to convene the general council, he said.

 Dhinakaran said if Palaniswami did not want   to be the general secretary, he should also relinquish the chief minister's post and get reelected. Dhinakaran said his team would wait for a day or two and “if the governor does not take any action... will take the next step“.
 
 Sasikala's brother V K Dhivakaran also rejected the expulsion of his sister and Dhinakaran from key party posts. “We will convene the real general council meeting of AIADMK soon with prior approval from the party general secretary V K Sasikala,“ he told reporters at Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district. He said 95% of the party is with them.
 
 
 
 TTV Dhinakaran `sacked' CM   as headquarters secretary of the AIADMK and replaced him with Pappireddipatti MLA P Palaniappan. Also, forests minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan was `removed' as party treasurer, a post given to him by V K Sasikala.
