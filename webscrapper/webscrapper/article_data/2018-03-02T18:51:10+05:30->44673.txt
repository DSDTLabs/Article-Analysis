Get up Srinu, popular for his skits on the super hit comedy show   on   revealed some interesting things about celebrity  . “Pradeep and I go back a long way. We were colleagues at Local TV (A defunct Hyderabad-based cable television channel). Pradeep is a very warm-hearted person. He used to auction his costumes and donate the proceeds to charity. But nobody writes about these things. But when he was caught in a drink-and-drive case, the media went overboard and portrayed him as a sort of villain. I was very pained by this and wanted to call him but I didn’t as I thought it might make him feel guilty,” said Srinu and added, “I think the media will now focus on me for making the above remarks. But it’s okay, I’ll take them in my stride.”
