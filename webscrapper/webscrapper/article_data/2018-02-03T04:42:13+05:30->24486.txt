MUMBAI: The IIT tuition fee increase in 2016 hit the financial   provided by the   to students from the economically-weaker section.

 The association still managed to reach out to about 15% of the fresh students in the first year of the fee increase. In the last eight years, the Financial Aid Programme (FAP) of the association helped raise over Rs 7.36 crore to benefit 840 students. On Friday,   Ruyintan Mehta donated Rs 1.27 crore to support meritorious students from financially constrained backgrounds.
 
 The implementation of the steep fee hike in 2016 has resulted in an increase in the number of students requiring financial aid, said an alumnus. The association is ensuring that more and more beneficiaries reach out to them to make sure that the fund does not go dry, said the alumnus, who is also a committee member of the FAP. The money raised under the FAP also includes money returned by the beneficiaries of the programme after they graduate from the institute.
 
 The association collaborated with Bengaluru-based Foundation for Excellence to support students. Mehta’s donation was made under this partnership. No student at the institute misses a chance to study due to the non-availability of funds, said a professor. 
 
 “It’s a debt we (alumnus) feel towards our alma mater, especially for those of us who move out of the country. This is our way of giving back guru-dakshina to the institute,” said Mehta, who is also the president of   Heritage Foundation in the US.
