NEW DELHI: After the Delhi high court rap on Thursday, the Delhi government’s   has decided to take strict action against   that do not have  .

 “We will take a tough stand against those flouting the mandatory norm and their permits would be cancelled,” KK Dahiya, special commissioner (Transport) told TOI.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar cited a TOI report on September 12 incident and slammed the police and transport department for failing to enforce safety of passengers. The taxi in question did not have a GPS-based fare meter, which was made mandatory by the transport department.
 
 The department also plans to shift its control room from Kashmere Gate to Underhill Road in Civil Lines. “Currently, we take reports from the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS), which monitors the live feeds. However, due to locational disadvantage of the present control room, we were unable to monitor live feeds ourselves,” Dahiya said.
 
 He further said, “After setting up of the control room at Civil Lines, senior officials will monitor the live   feeds from autorickshaws and taxis in Delhi.”
 
 The department is planning to create a makeshift control room at present on the rooftop of the headquarter building. There are about 70,000 cabs in the city, including kaali peeli taxis and cabs of app-based aggregators, apart from about 80,000 autorickshaws, Dahiya said.
