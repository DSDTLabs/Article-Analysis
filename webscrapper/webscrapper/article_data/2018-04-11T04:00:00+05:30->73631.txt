Rajkot: Beware before consuming your favourite ‘golas’ or sugarcane juice this summer.

 The health department teams of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) cracked down on two famous gola centres which were risking people’s lives by using rotten dry fruits and unhygienic rabdi and mawa. 
 
 In the raid on Azad Hind Golawala, who has been selling gola for more than 50 years in Trikon Baug, health officers found that they were reusing disposable spoons dumped by people in the dustbin after eating golas. They also destroyed 57kg rabdi and mawa that were unfit for consumption. Dry fruits used in golas were rotten and they too were destroyed.
 
 Akshar Gola, another famous centre on Sadhu Vaswani Road, was also reusing disposable spoon and ice was found stored in unhygienic condition, RMC said in a statement. 
 
 The civic body issued notices to both the shops. 
 
 RMC team also raided nearly 21 sugarcane juice centres and destroyed close to 36kg ice kept in unhygienic condition.
