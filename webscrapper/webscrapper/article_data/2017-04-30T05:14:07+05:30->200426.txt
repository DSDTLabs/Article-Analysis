 The Juhu police have arrested Laxman Kumar Thakko Sah and the teenager, Sajirol Haq (19), for threatening and extortion under the Indian Penal Code. Police are on the lookout for another accused, Pankaj Roy, who is believed to be the brains behind the conspiracy.
 
 The builder has some construction projects in the western suburbs. Early this month, he started receiving the threat calls from unknown numbers and the caller said his name was Abubhai. According to a source, the caller seemed to know everything about the complainant, which scared the latter.
 
 "The accused used foul and abusive language to threaten the builder, who finally approached the police," said police.
 
 Based on the call details, police picked up Haq, who is a West Bengal native and works as a delivery boy at a hotel in the western suburbs. During interrogations, Haq named his accomplice, Sah, a Bihar native who works as a driver with a private towing van. The duo has told police that it was Roy's idea to threaten the builder and extort money from him. They have told police that Roy used to work with the builder earlier and hence had his information.
