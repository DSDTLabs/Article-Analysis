NEW DELHI: PM   has set a five-year deadline for completing all pending projects. On Wednesday, he told all secretaries at the Centre and chief secretaries in states that the "yesteryears' speed of implementation won't be acceptable". 

  PM made these remarks while chairing the Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI), a monthly web-based interaction with bureaucrats on Wednesday during which the decades' old Howrah-Amta-Champadanga new broad gauge line project came up for review. The railway project was sanctioned in 1974-75 following a request from the state, but land acquisition started only in 2009. "PM said the country will not forgive all of us for such delays and exorbitant increase in project cost. He said we will be celebrating 75 years of India's independence in 2022. All departments must strive to ensure all pending projects are completed by then," a source said. 
 
 Modi also asked railways to follow “grand challenge mode” for undertaking railway projects something that the Union road transport ministry will start. “The PM urged all chief secretaries to work expeditiously towards ensuring that all traders register under the GST regime, and this task is completed before August 15,” a statement issued by PMO said.
