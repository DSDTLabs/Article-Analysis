NEW DELHI: A mentally challenged girl stuck in a   house near Paharganj was saved by two policemen after locals noticed smoke coming out of the first floor of a four-storey building on Tuesday afternoon. A room heater, which was left on by the nine-year-old’s mother, caught fire, the   said. 

 Soon after receiving a call, the policemen reached the building near Kuchha Pandit at Lal Kuan along with a quick response team. They first rescued 15 people stuck on the second and third floors. While coming down, head constable Manoj peeped into the first-floor apartment from which the smoke was coming out and found Kirti unconscious. “She was rescued and Manoj took her to hospital,” said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, DCP (central). 
 
 Kirti, who is recuperating from shock, did not realise that a fire had broken out until she started feeling suffocated. Even then she could not raise an alarm due to speech impairment. “I tied a handkerchief on my face to avoid getting choked,” said Manoj. 
 
 The girl’s mother and elder sister had gone for shopping. But two other families staying in the building did not realise that Kirti was alone at home. Locals said the fire brigade could reach the building only an hour later due to narrow lanes. 
 
 Kirti, who stays with her mother and grandmother at the rented house, has been undergoing treatment at LNJP Hospital. Her father owns a farm land at Etah.
