THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After over one year of spending his life inside the four walls of the  , Maldivian businessman Mohammed Yafiu will finally get some relief this week as he is expected to walk out of the station. A trial court here has passed a favourable court order in this regard on Thursday.

 TOI had earlier reported about the plight of Mohammed Yafiu, who was arrested by   from a city hotel on charges of drug trafficking. 
 
 Though he was released from prison later after trial court acquitted him of the charges following a trial, he was confined to the Poojappura police station as his visa expired by that time and also the state government refused to release his passport citing that they would challenge the trial court verdict before the state high court.
 
 Yafiu was arrested in September 2013. He was exonerated by the court in November 2015. He spent over two years in prison as an undertrial and another one year in the police station.
 
 Yafiu’s counsel had also approached the high court seeking justice for him. Following this, the HC ordered in April last year to expedite steps to renew his visa. Later in August, the court again ordered to arrange an accommodation for Yafiu outside the station. 
 
 Based on this court order the station house officer of Poojappura police station filed an application before the trial court here seeking release of the young businessman from the station.
 
 Poojapura sub-inspector R Rajesh said that Yafiu’s mother was expected to arrive in the city this week, following which he would be released.
 
 Yafiu’s counsel advocate Suresh Kumar said that even though the court order is to arrange an accommodation in the city itself, they would be filing another plea seeking permission to return to his country on condition of marking his attendance before the police here periodically, considering the amount of time he has spent unnecessarily in prison as well as in the police station.
