MAPUSA: In a bid to crack down on illegal mobile handcarts, the   (MMC) on Friday issued a notice to cart owners asking them to submit their trade licences within 15 days, failing which the carts will be seized by the civic body.

  (MMC) chairperson   said there was a need to maintain proper record, check and control over the carts in the market and the exercise will serve that purpose. 
 
 He said records revealed there were about 160 handcarts operating in Mapusa.
 
 “Some handcarts don’t have trade licences. We don’t have a record of what they sell. Some have even turned into permanent carts, while some have not renewed their licences. This leads to loss of revenue for the MMC. These handcarts also seem to be increasing in numbers. All these issues will be taken care of through this effort,” Kavlekar said.
 
 The MMC chairperson said some of the carts, which were earlier used to supply goods to grocery shops, were also issued trade licence as handcarts. 
 
 This exercise will throw some light on the present status of these carts, he added.
