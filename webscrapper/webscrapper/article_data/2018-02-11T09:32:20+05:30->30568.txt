PUNE: Janwani, an NGO working in the sphere of   management, will conduct two heritage walks around the city on Sunday and Monday, with Sunday's walk billed as a walk for religious harmony as much as for heritage. 

 City-based conservationist   and other walk guides will take people around Pune on Sunday morning. The walk will focus on religious harmony and the city's rich cultural and architectural legacy.
 
 "Such a walk is essential these days because I think we have lost the broad-mindedness that was present when such structures came up. There was no strict assertion of identity and people of various faiths lived in peace. We actually thought of such a walk a while back as something different from the usual heritage walk," says Kalamdani.
 
 The walk will take visitors to five centres of faith and remembrance, all within a square mile area of Sassoon chowk. It will start with a visit to the memorials of Gosavis, who formed part of the intelligence network of the Peshwas. The tour will end with a visit to Parsi agiary and Ohel  , belonging to the Parsis and Jews, who played a huge influence in the city's history and its development.
