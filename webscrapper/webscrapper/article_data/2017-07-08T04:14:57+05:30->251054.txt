GURUGRAM: Nearly 2,000 vehicles have been falsely claiming fee   at   toll  , according to a survey conducted by highway concessionaire, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL).

 As the   authorities were confused because many people showed   identity and registration   to escape the toll fee, the concessionaire conducted a survey from June 9-19 and found 1,997 people falsely claimed exemption at the toll plaza.
 
 Around 80,000 vehicles cross from Kherki-Daula toll plaza everyday. The officials from MCEPL say that out of these, around 10 per cent drivers create ruckus everyday in order to avoid payment of toll fee. MCEPL has provided 6,826 people in 31 villages with free tags that will exempt them from paying the toll fee. In all the villages, there are 3,421 personal vehicles, 1,888 commercial vehicles and 83 vehicles registered in the companies’ name, listed with the concessionaire.
 
 The concessionaire observed that everyday 8,107 vehicles pass the toll plaza without paying the fee. Moreover, 859 vehicles are not even registered with Gurgaon’s regional transport authority. In order to avoid the snarls and disruption in future, the concessionaire will reissue the free tags to listed vehicles on the basis of the survey.
 
 “The private and commercial vehicles will be fixed with the free tags before the end of August 2017. We will also take legal action against the defaulters who weren’t listed with the concessionaire,” said S Raghuraman, CEO, MCEPL.
