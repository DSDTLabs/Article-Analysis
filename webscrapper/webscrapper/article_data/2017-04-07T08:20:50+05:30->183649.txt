CHENNAI: Sympathisers of the O   faction of the AIADMK on Thursday took out a rally with a plastic fibre replica of former chief minister  's 'body', placed in a coffin. A campaign van carried the 'coffin' across the constituency to facilitate the people pay homage to their departed 'leader'. 

 "The death scene was recreated because that was how we last saw Amma," said  , a supporter of the OPS faction and the architect of the campaign. "The Mannargudi mafia didn't let us see   properly even after her death. Amma's mortal remains were buried in a hurry. So, I decided to make a miniature replica of her body and coffin to show it to the public. Seeing the 'body' let them decide who they want to vote for," she said. The OPS faction has been whipping up passion over the mystery that shrouded Jayalalithaa's death.
 
 When the campaign van rolled out from the RK Nagar election office of OPS wing candidate E   at 4pm, party workers accompanying the vehicle sang melancholic songs to set the mood. Some offered floral tributes too. As the campaign picked up momentum, social media was flooded with caustic comments.
 
 OPS team spokesman 'Aspire' K Swaminathan, however, clarified that it did not have the support of the faction. He said former minister and Panneerselvam supporter K Pandiarajan came upon the procession at Korukkupet and advised the group to give up the bizarre rally. How much of an impact the campaign would have on the electorate is anybody's guess.
