NAGPUR: Frustrated over lack of development, residents of   colony in  , from ward 13 has decided to boycott voting in the upcoming   (NMC) elections, to be held on February 21. 

 The residents are paying NMC taxes regularly for the past 9 years, but no facilities are provided by the municipal corporation. Many corporators approached the colony to woo the residents but were shunned. “Corporators has no right to ask for votes, as they had provided nothing to us even though we had paid taxes regularly,” said  , vice president of the society.
 
 All the roads in the society are full of potholes and make it difficult for the residents to drive their vehicles specially during the rainy season. There is no provision of sewage system in the area because of which the well water gets contaminated regularly. The maintenance of street lights in the society is also not done by the NMC. “ Many times there are no lights on the roads, we have to call electrician and repair it by ourselves, it is like we are paying double for same maintenance, it is totally unfair to us,” said Sandeep Parakh secretary of the society.
 
 The NMC is shying away from providing services in the area saying handing over of society is not done by the builder. “NMC has provided us with occupancy certificates and we are regularly paying taxes then, why is NMC refusing to help us?” asked Krishna Kumar, a resident of the society.
 
 Residents of Saroj Nagar has approached NMC, corporators and builder of the society   but none of them had cooperated, residents alleged. The residents had also submitted a written letter to the NMC’s commissioner office. The residents are now also thinking to approach courts to get justice.
