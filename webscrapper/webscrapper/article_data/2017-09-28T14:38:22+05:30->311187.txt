AHMEDABAD: Advocates practicing in   high court abstained from work on Wednesday to protest against the   to transfer   high court judge Jayant Patel “on the eve of his elevation as acting chief justice/chief justice”.

 Justice Patel, who worked as a judge here for 15 years, resigned on Monday following his transfer to Allahabad high court. He is the senior most judge in Karnataka HC and was likely to become the chief justice as the present CJ SK Mokherjee is retiring on October 9.
 
  The Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association (GHAA) appealed lawyers to strike work on Wednesday by passing a resolution in this regard after Justice Patel resigned. The lawyers’ association has also resolved to file a petition in the SC against Justice Patel’s transfer. It also appealed other Bar associations to observe a strike, but lower courts’ functioning continued.
 
 Meanwhile, the   (BCG) did not join the strike, but its executive committee also met today. It resolved, “Looking to the present situation, the independence of system of judiciary (lower to higher) is required discussion at length. Therefore, it is requested to the chairman to call upon the general board meeting to discuss the same issue.”
