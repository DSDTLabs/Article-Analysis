 “In October, we presented it as a poster at the UAE Cancer Congress held in Dubai where the case was well received. We have searched literature which suggests that there would be 30 to 35 such cases across the globe where both the surgeries are done simultaneously,” said Dr Dipayan Nandy, surgical oncologist. 
 
 Based on the success of this case, the team of cardiac and cancer surgeons from a city-based private multispecialty hospital carried out such surgeries on two other patients. 
 
 “In November-end, we had a 38-year-old patient from Rajpipla, who was suffering from both ovarian cancer and mitral valve disease. We followed the same procedure in this case as well. In this case, there was an additional risk of bleeding because of anti-coagulant,” said Dr Gaurav Goel, senior consultant (cardiothorasic surgery) and heart disease specialist at the hospital. 
 
 “She has also survived after we completed both valve replacement and ovarian cancer surgery and is taking chemotherapy treatment now,” said Goel. 
 
 “In the third case, a male patient from Ankleshwar was suffering from tongue cancer and triple vessel disease. He was also treated and both the surgeries were completed simultaneously,” said Dr Jatin Desai, surgical oncologist. 
 
 He also added that while cardiac surgery takes four hours, cancer surgeries took around two hours in these cases.
