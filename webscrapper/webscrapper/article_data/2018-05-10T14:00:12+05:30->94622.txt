COIMBATORE: The district administration has ordered to constitute a committee to inspect   in the district on implementation of reservation for students from SC/ST communities in Class XI admissions. Officials said it would be formed this week.

 The move comes amid SC/ST welfare organizations raising concerns that schools were flouting the reservation rules. According to the rules, SC students should be allotted 18% seats and 1% for ST students.
 
 Earlier, state secretary of   had petitioned the district collector to set up a committee to inspect and take action against schools which were found flouting the rules. In his petition, he had said schools in the district had been admitting students of their own accord without following the reservation rules. “Though the school education department had sent circulars to schools in the past and this year, the schools have found to have flouted the norms,” he said in the petition.
