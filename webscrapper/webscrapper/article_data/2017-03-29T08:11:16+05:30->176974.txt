NEW DELHI: Rakesh (name changed) enrolled for Aadhaar with his original identity documents on March 17 in Delhi. The next day, he enrolled himself as Raj Kishore (fake name) in Noida by using a forged driving licence. To his bad luck, the Aadhaar number was generated on his fake name. Now, Rakesh will have to live with his fake name (Raj Kishore) for the rest of his life. 

 That’s not all. He will need to get his name changed to Raj Kishore in his bank accounts, PAN card, voter ID card and school certificates. He will also face the law for giving biometrics at two enrolment centres using forged documents and may face a three-year jail term as per the Aadhaar Act as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has filed an FIR against him. 
 
 An official said it was easy for an individual to get enrolled several times using forged identity documents and get many temporary enrolment IDs but nobody could get multiple permanent Aadhaar numbers as fake enrolments would be rejected when the UIDAI carried out verification of biometric details given by the individual. 
 
 He added that only one Aadhaar number could be generated for an individual on his or her unique biometric details. And once an Aadhaar number is generated for a name (identity), it can never be changed. 
 
 The UIDAI has noticed that people are trying to generate multiple temporary IDs by enrolling with different names to seek benefits of welfare schemes such as LPG subsidy. “People should not even attempt to enrol twice. They will be caught very easily. They are unaware that they have given their biometrics. The punishment is also very serious,” UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said.
