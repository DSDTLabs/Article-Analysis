PUNE: The   may still be a few months away, but passengers in the   can now expect a faster delivery of the comfort cloth.

 The Central Railways has introduced a linen distribution trolley on-board the Pune-Ahmedabad Duronto Express in the first phase of the project.
  
  
 
 Officials of the Pune division of Central Railway said the trolleys will ensure faster delivery of the linen to the passengers and that too in a more hygienic way. To start with, the trolleys have been introduced in the AC-1 compartment of the train and the rest of the compartments will get the facility soon.
 
 
 The officials said all trains originating from Pune will have the service in the AC-1 and AC-2 compartments. “The linen used by the passengers need a proper distribution system. Many passengers complain about the way the bed sheets and pillows are distributed. The cleanliness of the linen is a concern and steps have been taken to better the condition,” a railway official said.
 
 
 Once the passengers take their seats, an attendant will move into the compartment with the trolley, mainly carrying the bed sheets, and distribute the linen. “At present, the coach attendants dump the linen on the seats. The way it is carried is shabby. We have focused on the distribution system and want the passengers to feel good. The trolley service will be soon introduced in more express trains,” he added.
 
 
 For the passengers, cleanliness of the linen continues to be a major concern. “We appreciate the move, but the Railways must ensure clean linen for the passengers. Complaints about dirty linen are frequent,” said Sudhanshu Garg, who travels on trains frequently.
