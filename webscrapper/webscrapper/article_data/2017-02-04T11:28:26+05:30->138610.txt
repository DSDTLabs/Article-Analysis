VADODARA: The state government has given nod for the formation of the   (SPV) to handle the Smart City Mission projects in the city. The formation of the SPV is mandatory under the mission.

 The   (VMC) had sent a proposal to the state government seeking its approval for the SPV that will be headed by the municipal commissioner. The state government recently gave a go ahead for the formation of the SPV.
 
 Besides the commissioner, the SPV will have the VMC standing committee chairperson, a deputy municipal commissioner, a nominee of the central government, a nominee of the state government, the VMC city engineer, the district collector and the Vadodara   (VUDA) chairperson or   chief executive authority as directors. The SPV will also appoint a chief executive officer.
 
 The SPV has tentatively been named as   Ltd. VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the process of registering the company has been initiated. The final name of the company would also be decided and finalised soon.
 
 The implementation of the Smart City Mission at the city level will be done by the SPV. It will plan, appraise, approve, release funds, implement, manage, operate, monitor and evaluate the Smart City development projects. The SPV will be a limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013. Last year, the VMC general board had authorised the municipal commissioner to conduct necessary proceedings regarding the SPV. Following this the proposal was sent to the state government.
