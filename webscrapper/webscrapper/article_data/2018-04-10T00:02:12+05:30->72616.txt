Kottayam: An elated Ameeya Saleem said she expected a favourable verdict from the court as there was no fault on her part. The Class X student of Mount Carmel Vidyanikethan here had moved the high court after it was found that she was given an old question paper to answer at the recently-held All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) conducted by  . The court, on Monday, said that the central board can give retest to Ameeya, prior to evaluation of answer sheets of other students who had taken the test on March 28.

 However, the student did not hide her disappointment over the unexpected turn of events following the exam and the response of the authorities when she brought the issue to their notice. 
 
 As soon as she came out of the exam hall, Ameeya realised that her mathematics question paper was different from that of her friends. Though she informed the school authorities, the latter took it lightly. After going home, she found that it was exactly the same questions her brother got when he gave the test two years ago. Following this her parents filed a complaint with the school authorities, who took up the matter with CBSE.
 
 “They (CBSE officials) said I was lying. That was more painful than the uncertainty over my future,” said Ameeya. The school authorities had initially contacted an officer at regional office of CBSE in Thiruvananthapuram. However, when they tried calling the number again, it was switched off. Later a complaint was registered online, she said.
 
 Nassar, the girl’s relative, said it was shocking to see that a student who was quite good at studies had to face such an ordeal. Ameeya added that she would give a fitting reply to the board by scoring good marks in the retest.
 
 Ameeya is a resident of Kummanam here. Her father Saleem is working in Dubai.
