NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister   while addressing a 
  with Congress VP   on Sunday took a sizeist apparently 'sexist' dig at rival Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) chief  .

 "How could we have given space to her (Mayawati)? She takes so much space, even her party symbol is that of an elephant," Yadav said while responding to a question about whether BSP could have been part of the alliance.
 
 
  However, Rahul on the other hand abstained from personal remarks.
 
 
  
 
 "Mayawati made some mistakes when she was in power, but that she was not 'dangerous', like the BJP," Rahul said while appreciating BSP supremo.
 
 "I personally respect Mayawati," Rahul added.
