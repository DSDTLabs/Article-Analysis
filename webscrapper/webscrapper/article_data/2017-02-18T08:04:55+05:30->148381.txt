PUNE: Defence minister   on Friday asserted that the Indian   has “full freedom” while conducting counter-insurgency operations and “full rights” to deal with elements creating a “hindrance” during such operations.

 “Our government gives full freedom to officers who are involved in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism (CICT) operations to do whatever they feel is right. We will not stop them. If someone pelts stones at them during these operations, they know how to deal with them sternly,” he said.
 
 Backing General Bipin Rawat’s recent statements, Parrikar said the army chief had talked in the context of security and had not said anything wrong. The minister took at swipe at political parties for “making an issue” out of Rawat’s statements, saying their comments were “totally unnecessary”.
 
 On Wednesday, Rawat had warned of tough action against those attacking security forces during anti-militancy operations. He said people creating hurdles during such operations and displaying flags of Pakistan and   in J&K would be treated as “anti-nationals”.
 
 Parrikar, who was speaking as chief guest at a gathering of 500 ex-servicemen at  , said the army would never attack people who had “good intentions”. 
 
 “Nowadays (during the winters), terrorists come from jungles and take asylum in villages. If the army has specific information about terrorists and if somebody tries to help them, the army then knows pretty well how to act against them,” he said.
 
 “The country is bigger than any political party. The armed forces keep this in mind and fight for the country,” he added.
