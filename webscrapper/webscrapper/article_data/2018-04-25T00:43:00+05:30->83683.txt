Trichy: An object which “fell from the sky” in front of the hut of a farmer set off a buzz among villagers of Vettamangalam in Karur district on Monday. According to police, Kathan, 55, a resident of Semangi, was fast asleep along with his son in the front yard of his house on a cot when he woke up in the wee hours hearing a loud noise. He was shocked to see a metal piece weighing around 5 kg beside him. 

 He informed his neighbours about the incident and later the village administrative officer, Poobathi, who in turn alerted Velayuthampalayam police. The police who visited the spot checked the object even as villagers started propounding various theories.
 
 Police said that the object was recovered by the revenue officials and a thorough examination was on. As the main road was situated just 180 feet away from the house, it would even have been a part of a vehicle. Police said that the enquiry was continuing.
