NEW DELHI: As many as 25 terrorists lodged in  's jails have been shifted to prisons in the   region as a precautionary measure after the dramatic escape of jailed Pakistani terrorist Naveed Jat from Srinagar's SMHS hospital.

 
 Sixteen of the 25 relocated terrorists are Pakistanis. The shift is expected to minimise the chances of dreaded terrorists conspiring with other like-minded inmates, visitors including terror accomplices as well as jail or hospital staff to pull off an escape and resume violent activities.
 
 The NIA, which is probing Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Jat's escape amid a shootout at SMHS hospital that left two J&K police personnel dead, is expected to unravel the conspiracy angle and investigate how a "dreaded" terrorist like Jat managed to get "favourable" orders from jail authorities as well as doctors, said an officer. Sources said the   will examine the role of jail doctors as Jat, who was not suffering from any notable ailment, was referred by jail doctors to SMHS for check-up at short intervals.
 
 The NIA will investigate possible collusion on part of jail doctors, particularly a woman medical officer who referred Jat to SMHS hospital, other members of the jail staff, prison inmates as well as SMHS staff in his well-planned escape from the hospital's out-patient department. The NIA is currently questioning the five suspects arrested in the case. However, it is still on the lookout for Hilal, the suspected mastermind who hatched the conspiracy and also fired the fatal shots at the two policemen. Hilal, believed to have planned the escape along with top   commander Riyaz Naikoo, was earlier an overground worker but subsequently joined militancy.
 
 The home ministry has asked the J&K government to conduct a detailed inquiry into the events leading to Jat's escape and submit a report in 15 days. It has also asked the state administration to revamp the security of jails in J&K.
