LUCKNOW: There are no   in about half of UP’s   for conducting test to issue  . To make up for the lack, simulators will be installed 19   offices in UP, including Lucknow and other divisional headquarters, by March. 

 “Simulators will present on a screen a road with different lanes, dividers, pits and roadblocks. Applicants will be asked to drive virtually and show,” said sources in transport department. 
 
 Regional transport offices don’t have vacant space to test applicants. In Lucknow’s Mahanagar RTO, sources said there are instructions to make people drive on the road in front of the office and it’s hardly possible given the traffic. 
 
 Lucknow has another RTO office at Transportnagar which has a track, while some of the bigger centres like Noida receiving close to 300 DL applications daily don’t have even an office to call their own. 
 
 Out of 75 districts, RTOs in 20 districts work out of rented premises where there is fight for every inch of space. Bareilly, Azamgarh, Muzaffarnagar, Banda and Rampur are other bigger centres where RTOs are situated in rented buildings. At some of these places, offices are on storeys above ground. 
 
 Transport department is also mulling to propose buying vacant land to construct testing tracks. “Being a government department we cannot do that but if allowed under road safety fund rules, we can buy vacant land from farmers and construct testing tracks where applicants from two or three nearby districts can come for test,” said sources. 
 
 Besides, transport department has written to district administration in all districts to allot vacant land. Meanwhile, state government in last three years has constructed 39 manual testing tracks. At least seven such tracks are under construction. “We also have a shortage of regional inspectors who can test applicants for driving skills on manual testing tracks. Simulators would automatically create road-conditions for applicants,” said sources.
