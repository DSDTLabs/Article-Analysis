GUNTUR: Asserting that the fight for special category status (SCS) will go on,   YS Vijayamma on Sunday urged chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to join hands with her party MPs to step up the movement against the Centre.

 “It is not too late. Don’t work with a hidden agenda. Make your MPs quit and join the fight launched by YSRCP,” Vijayamma suggested. She said that SCS is the lifeline of the state and YSRCP will not rest till the special tag is achieved. Vijayamma visited party MPs, who took up indefinite fast demanding SCS, at Andhra Bhavan in New Delhi, to express her solidarity. 
 
 
 Speaking to party activists, Vijayamma said that YSRCP has been consistent on the issue of SCS as it believes that only SCS can bring development to the state. “We need to question the Centre for not granting SCS as promised in parliament. Party president Jagan had kept the issue alive with a series of protests against the Centre in the last four years,” she claimed. She said that they literally brought the movement to New Delhi by making their MPs quit the   and launch indefinite fast. She blamed Chandrababu Naidu for the Centre taking the issue lightly . “Naidu has made several U-turns and attempts to suppress the SCS movement,” she alleged.
 
 Vijayamma said that TDP has failed to understand the seriousness of the issue and made its MPs to quit the Lok Sabha to create a nationwide impact. She said that Chandrababu Naidu did not accept their suggestion as he has hidden agenda. She said that YSRCP had moved no confidence motion for 12 days but it was not taken up for discussion . “Our MPs took a bold decision to sit on indefinite fast to achieve the SCS dream,” said Vijayamma.
 
 “Late chief minister YSR wanted a bigger state which would have more representation in the Lok Sabha and garner the attention of the Centre.AP was divided to weaken the bargaining power of  ,” she rued.
