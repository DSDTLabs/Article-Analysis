We should work together to achieve the target by October 2018. People should also help the authorities to make the district clean.”
  
  Asking officials to follow the government’s instructions in letter and spirit, the minister warned, “If officers want to remain in government service, they should work according to the instructions and orders of the government. They should implement government schemes honestly. The schemes should not remain on papers only, but should be implemented at the grass-roots level.”
  
  Stress on scheme of power, health, education and PWD departments, Sharma said, “People directly connect with these departments, and benefit of these departments should go to public.”
  
  Instructing the superintendent of police, he said, “Police should treat complainants well, and all complaints should be resolved honestly. If any police officer is found misbehaving with complainants, strict action will be taken against him. All district level officers, including SP and DM, should adopt one primary school each to improve education standard. Apart from this, streetlights should be set up in rural and urban areas and all pits on roads should be filled up by June 15.”
  
  At the end of the meeting, the minister gave oath of ‘swachchhta’ to the officers. Later, he visited district hospital, where he found a heap of garbage burning on the premises. He pulled up the authorities for this.
