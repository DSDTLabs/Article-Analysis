Chennai: The DMK has threatened a jail bharo protest on January 29 if the government does not withdraw the bus fare hike. The party and its allies including Congress and CPI had earlier announced a state-wide protest on January 27.

 A release from the party headquarters said cadres would resort to road and rail roko protest on January 29 and fill up prisons if the government refused to withdraw the hike.
 
 Poor people, daily workers and middle class people were affected by the increase in bus fare, said a party statement. Soon after the fare increase was announced, DMK working president M K Stalin had asked the government to withdraw the hike. Stalin also wrote a letter to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami stating that people were angry over the fare revision.
