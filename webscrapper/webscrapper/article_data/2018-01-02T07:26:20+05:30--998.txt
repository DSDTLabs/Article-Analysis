KOLKATA: The New Year started on a gloomy note for Kolkata with a cyclonic circulation in neighbouring   keeping the city cloudy. But the cloud cover is set to recede and chill will take over, predicted the Met office. The minimum temperature could drop by a degree on Tuesday and eventually plunge below 14°C in the course of the week.

 On Monday, Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 15.3°C while the maximum stood at 27.7°C, three notches above normal.
 
 With the northwesterly wind getting stronger, both day and night temperatures were set to drop, according to GK Das, director,   ( ). “The chill has started flowing in with the northwesterly. So, the minimum temperature could plunge to less than 14°C. It will start getting cooler by the second half of Tuesday as the northwesterly gains strength. The chill should persist since there is no major system to block the wind,” said Das.
 
 The cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh will gradually weaken and recede, with no further impact on the weather in Kolkata. Even as the northwesterly gets stronger, the maximum temperature, too, will spiral down. “It has remained above the normal mark consistently, making it quite warm during the day. This is why the chill hasn’t really felt even when the minimum has dropped. But this week, the day temperature could plunge below the normal mark,” said Das.
 
 With the northwesterly remaining weak, the chill hasn’t been felt in Kolkata consistently this season. While the day temperature has been climbing up to around 26 degrees which is normal, the minimum temperature has hovered around 15-16 degrees. Early mornings and late evenings have been chilly. But with the maximum temperature remaining high, the chill has been missing during the day. The minimum temperature, on the other hand, has been spiraling down marginally due to the absence of a strong northwesterly.
