NAVI MUMBAI: The city municipal corporation has decided to float fresh tenders soon for reconstructing a   in  , as the previous contract was terminated due to delay in completing the project. 

 The contract for the Rs 16-crore project was initially given to Mahavir Roads and Infrastructure.
 
 The project did not take off even after contract period expired. The locals were upset because a structure, where cultural and sports activities were being held, had been demolished to pave way for the centre.
 
 During digging for the centre, the police station next to the plot started developing cracks. The contractor was told to repair the police station but   did not revise its budgetary allocation. The work has been stuck ever since and the dug-up plot has turned into a pond now. “The old structure was an ideal recreation centre,” said Vashi resident  .
 
 NMMC city engineer   said, “We have terminated the contract after reviewing the situation. Apart from an inordinate delay, the financial health of the contractor was found to be unsound. We will soon float fresh tenders inviting bidders.”
