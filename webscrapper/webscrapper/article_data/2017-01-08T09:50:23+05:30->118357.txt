HYDERABAD: Upset with being reprimanded by a 35-year-old woman for using her internet connection without her consent, a 19-year-old youth created a fake   profile of the woman and also posted   on it. Following a complaint from the victim, the cyber cell of the Rachakonda police commissionerate arrested Thummeti Ashok on Saturday.

 In her complaint, the woman said that she was being flooded with random telephone calls asking her to give the callers a ‘good time.’ After investigation, the cops zeroed in on a phone that was traced to AS Rao Nagar and arrested Ashok.
 
 “Ashok and the victim had been neighbours in LB Nagar. During his stay there, he used to use the victim’s Wi-Fi network to browse the internet. When the victim saw her exorbitant internet bill, she was shocked and learnt that Ashok was the cuplrit,” cyber cell inspector Mohammad Riyazuddin said. 
 
 During interrogation, Ashok confessed to having hacked into the victim’s internet connection. After she got to know about it, she warned Ashok to mend his ways, but the accused appeared to have nursed a grudge even after he moved to LB Nagar.
 
 “Once he moved out, he thought that it would be difficult for anyone to trace his cyber activities. He then brought a pre-activated SIM card and created a fake social media profile in the victim’s name,” said police.
 
 Incidentally, the profile name contained an expletive because of which the victim was flooded with phone calls. “Once he created the profile, he started posting pornographic images with captions reading ‘for a good time contact me’, and listed the woman’s phone number. It was then that the victim lodged a complaint with   sleuths. Ashok is currently in judicial custody. 
 
 Police said cybercrime was on the rise in the city. In October last year, a teacher of   was arrested for stalking and harassing a woman research scholar on the social media.
