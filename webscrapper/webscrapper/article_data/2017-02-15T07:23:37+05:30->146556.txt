HARIDWAR: The Congress has fielded a 'sadhu' here to counter the BJP . But whether this move seamlessly translates into support from the large community of Haridwar's ascetics remains to be seen. The Congress's   is fighting BJP's Madan Kaushik, three-term MLA, in this holy town that has almost 1.45 lakh voters.

 Swami Surendra Muni of Jagatram Udasin Ashram, Kankhal, claims many ashrams that earlier backed BJP now support Congress. "We've tested Kaushik thrice. It's time for change, more so when a community member is contesting". Not all sanyasis agree.  , former spokesman of the  , says there's anger against  's government, which will be directed against the Congress candidate.
 
 "This government has failed to check mining in the Ganga. It has arbitrarily raised house taxes for religious institutions. It's done nothing on prohibition.These will have a bearing on the polls."
 
 Also, there are sadhus who are disappointed with both parties and say they'll use the Nota option. "All politicians are guilty of doing nothing to solve our problems," says   of Bhuma Niketan.Many sadhus, he says, have decided not to vote for any party . "We launched an agitation demanding enough water at the Ganga ghats.The river goes dry , there isn't enough water for the holy dip.
 
 "We called off the stir on the CM's assurance. But he did nothing. We feel cheated.Neither has the Centre taken any steps to boost tourism," he alleges.
 
 BJP MLA Kaushik denies these charges. "The   government is taking steps to clean the Ganga. If BJP wins, the state and the Centre will work faster. The tax on ashram and akharas will be within justifiable limits," he says.
