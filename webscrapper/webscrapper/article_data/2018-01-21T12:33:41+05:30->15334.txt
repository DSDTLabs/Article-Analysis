HYDERABAD: Giving full credit to   chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for the speedy construction of the Kaleswaram irrigation project, governor ES L Narasimhan on Saturday said it would be apt to rename him Kaleshwaram Chandrasekhar Rao. 

 After visiting the project site, the governor said it was due to the CM's consistent efforts that the dream project became a reality. "So, I am renaming him as Kaleswaram Chandrasekhar Rao and irrigation minister   has become   as he is breathing life into the project," said Narasimhan.
 
 Narasimhan recalled the CM's PowerPoint presentation two years ago and said, "I have never seen a CM giving a PowerPoint presentation with the help of   maps and hi-tech tools. Browsing the computer, he showed me every detail of the project and now I have witnessed it physically," he said.
 
 The governor and his wife   toured Sundilla, Annaram, Kannepalli barrage sites and interacted with engineers and workers. Earlier, the governor visited the Kaleswaram temple and offered special puja.
