PUNE:   will soon get training in Vedic mathematics.

 Elected members have planned to introduce it in the next academic year. They have demanded Rs 6 crore for the project, under which phonics will be used for teaching. Phonics is the correlations between sound and symbol in an alphabetic writing system. The method is used to improve the reading ability of the students.
 
 “Students need to keep abreast of the trends in education. The new training will help them,” a proposal tabled before the standing committee stated. It will be discussed on Tuesday.
 
 According to education experts, elected members should focus on improving the basic knowledge of the students. “Surveys by various organisations have shown that students of civic schools are not faring well in basic mathematics and other skills. This must be improved. Then all other experiments can be done,” said  , an educational expert.
 
 Last year, Pune   approved a proposal to start abacus training for students in municipal schools. According to the civic body, the project aims to make students smarter, improve their mathematical skills and boost their memory. As per elected members, the project will be beneficial for students from standard V to VIII.
