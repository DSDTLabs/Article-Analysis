Vijayawada: The ghost of demonetisation was back to haunt residents on the outskirts of the city on Monday morning as   across the city ran out of cash between Nidamanuru and Ramavarappadu highway.

 Residents of Nidamanuru said the nearest ATMs with cash that they could find was located either at Gunadala or Mahanadu Road, at a distance of around 10 km from their place. In between, there are around 12 ATMs which either sport ‘out of service’ or ‘no cash’ signboards outside the doors.
 
 “Some of the private employees get their salaries late in the month and while we desperately look forward to withdraw money, we were forced to go from Kannur till MG Road to find an ATM that had cash,” said Maddisetti Srinivasa Rao, a private employee. 
 
 From paying rent to bills, people are relying on ATMs to withdraw cash. Bank officials too acknowledge that there has been a cash shortage in the past few months as the withdrawal rate has seen a spike across the 150-odd ATMs in and around Vijayawada. When contacted, the customer care representatives of some banks claimed that the issue would be resolved in the next few days.
 
 Senior bank officials at Andhra Bank zonal office said they have allocated cash worth more than Rs 120 crore for the ATMs across the state but admitted that it is insufficient. However, cash is still available with banks for people who seek to cash in their cheques but there are rare cases where some of the customers were asked to come the next day. 
 
 Residents are concerned that the cash shortage at ATMs might soon spill over to the city and said urgent steps needed to be taken in order to alleviate the problems of those living in the suburbs.
