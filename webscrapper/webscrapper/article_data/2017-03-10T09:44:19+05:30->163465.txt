KANNUR: Fr Robin Vadakkancheril, accused of raping a minor girl, was sent to police custody for four days by the Thalassery additional district sessions court on Thursday. 

 Police had said the priest, who has been arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, needed to be questioned further in the case. The case pertains to the rape and impregnation of a minor girl near Kottiyoor in Kannur.
 
 Police suspect a conspiracy was hatched to hush up the incident with the help of authorities at Christu Raj Hospital and some members of the Wayanad Child Welfare Committee (CWC), among others. Police said the new-born baby was shifted to the Holy Infant Mary's   in Wayanad on February 7 and that the documents related to the age of the girl were tampered. The CWC signed the order on February 20 without any verifying the documents, police added. 
 
  chairman   and member   have been expelled from their posts and have been named as accused in the case. They had moved for anticipatory bail in Wayanad additional district sessions court but withdrew their pleas on Thursday after the court said the case was in the jurisdiction of Thalassery additional district sessions court. Sources said they were planning to move the HC. However, they have been still absconding and police said search was on to arrest them along with other accused. 
 
 Thalassery additional district sessions court would consider the anticipatory bail plea of three others accused in the case from Christu Raj Hospital in Koothuparamba- gynaecologist  , administrator   and pediatrician Hyderali - on March 14. The court was likely to consider the bail plea of the other two nuns -Liz Maria and Anitta - on the same day.
