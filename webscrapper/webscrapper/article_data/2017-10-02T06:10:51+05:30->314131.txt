GURUGRAM: A 22-year-old man was allegedly   in the office of an ice factory in   on Saturday night.

 On Saturday evening, the man, Lokesh Kataria, consumed liquor with his cousin Ujjwal Kataria and five other people — Dharampal, Sunny, Akshay Punia, Amit and Pankaj. 
 
 The friends had gathered to celebrate Sunny’s son’s birthday in Ujjwal’s office in the factory, which is adjacent to a gaushala.
 
 While Lokesh was a resident of Basai, as were Ujjwal, his uncle Dharampal and Sunny, Akshay is a resident of Sector 7 and Amit and Pankaj live in Bhawani Enclave. 
 
 Pankaj works with Ujjwal in the factory.
 
 Ujjwal told the police that he and Pankaj left the office around 7pm, while the others left a little late. Around 10pm, Ujjwal sent back Pankaj to the factory to lock the office, but he found Lokesh had been shot at and was lying on a sofa and bleeding profusely. He immediately called Ujjwal, who reached the office with Dharampal and took Lokesh to a nearby government hospital in Sector 10. From there, he was rushed to Medanta hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Ujjwal also told police in his complaint that Lokesh had received a call a day before from a person named Raju, also a resident of Basai, who had asked Lokesh to not take the contract of fish farming in the local pond, as he wished to take it.
 
 The SHO of Sector 9A police station, Bijender Singh, said that no one seems to have   the murder, and there are no   camera footage covering the spot. An   has been lodged under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. “The bullet was shot at a close range, next to heart. No arrests have been made so far,” said Singh.
