Officials of   are used to mediating between squabling DU students. However, they got a complaint of a different kind recently. A group of teachers from   ( ) reached the police station on Friday evening to file a complaint against a student who slapped a professor after getting zero in his exam. Jatin Narwal, DCP North, tells us, “We have filed a case against the student under Sections 323, 341 and 506. We arrested him from the college and since it is a bailable offence, we released him on bail.” The police has filed a chargesheet and will take the case to court today.

 A professor who was in the group that went to the police station tells us, “This is pathetic. Teachers cannot do their job for fear of being beaten up. The student had not attended any class, and most of his teachers have given him zero. If he thought that this one teacher has a problem with him, he could have gone to the principal and some other teacher could have evaluated him instead. But he did not do anything when the marks were uploaded on the website or were told to him. Ab toh results aane wale hain, and the marks can’t be changed.”
 
 The student, Pardeep Phogat, who completed Law from Law Fac and is an ABVP member, says, “He had given me zero for my internals. I asked him if there was a way to solve this, but he didn’t reply. Then I held his hand and he said, ‘Main marks nahin doonga’. Tab maine unhe teen thappad mar diye. They have filed an FIR against me and the college is expected to take a decision today. I don’t regret it. I’ll go to the High Court to challenge the college if they rusticate me. The professor had also asked other teachers not to give me marks for this semester. He has finished my career now.”
 
 Pardeep was also appointed DUSU’s sports secretary last year. Currently, he is pursuing MBA in Global Business Operations from SRCC.
