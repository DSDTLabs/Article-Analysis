CHANDIGARH: Putting an end to speculations, the Congress confirmed on Thursday said that cricketer-turned-politician   will contest in the upcoming   as a party nominee. 

 “Navjot Singh Sidhu will contest from the constituency of his wife  ,” said Punjab Congress president   while talking to mediapersons in Delhi on Thursday.
 
 “Sidhu will contest from Amritsar (East) seat as a Congress nominee,” he added.
 
 After Sidhu resigned from the BJP on September 14, 2016, there had initially been speculations on whether he will join the AAP or the Congress. But after his wife joined the Congress last month and he too held meetings with Congress leaders, his induction in the party now looks imminent. 
 
 There has been confusion over whether Sidhu or his wife will contest the election and Punjab Congress leaders have maintained that that the Amritsar (East) seat has been reserved for the couple and now it is their call.
