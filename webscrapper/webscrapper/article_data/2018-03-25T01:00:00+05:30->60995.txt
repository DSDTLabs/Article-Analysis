After they tied the knot in a hush-hush affair on March 3 in   (Tamil Nadu),   and   flew off to an isolated island in   for their honeymoon. The newly-weds returned to the bay earlier this week.
Opening up about her wedding and honeymoon for the first time, Rochelle tells  , “We wanted to cut off from the outside world the moment we boarded the flight. So, we switched off our phones and electronic devices, setting our hearts and minds on the sand and the sea. Our choice was a quaint and isolated island off the coast of Lombok, Indonesia. We stayed at a beautiful boutique villa, situated on a pristine beach. We chose homestay to experience authentic local culture.”   adds, “I usually prefer relaxing by the beach, but decided to follow my wife’s adventurous ways this time around. She convinced me to go paragliding, scuba diving and snorkelling. This is definitely one of the best trips we’ve had together and it’s even more special as it was our honeymoon.”
 Ask him why he stayed quiet about the wedding and he replies, “We always wanted to keep it intimate and away from the media glare.”
