Indore: The ongoing protest called by the Bharatiya   (BKS) may hit supplies of milk and vegetables in the Indore city triggering a   hike. 

 The BKS, a group of farmers of Indore region, are protesting against the amendments in the land use and other changes in compensation norms to farmers for their lands. Local milk and vegetable suppliers have raised concerns about the ongoing protest and said continuation of the protest may hit supplies of essential commodities sourced from rural areas. 
 
 Indore BKS spokesperson Dilip Mukati said, “We have been protesting to safeguard the rights of farmers. The changes in the Town and Country Planning Act are not in favour of them.”
 
  He said, “If our demands will not be heard then we will stop the supply of milk and vegetables from villages to Indore city. We have been forced by the government to resort to these levels because they are not ready to understand the plight of farmers, who are losing their land as well as the right to fight for them.”
 
 In the city, the daily requirement of milk is about 13-14 lakh liters and the production is around 12 lakh liters sourced from nearby villages. 
 
 Indore Dudgh Vikreta Sangh president Bharat Mathurawala said, “If supply of milk is stopped from villages then everyone, including farmers and customers will suffer. It is an essential commodity needed every day. ”
