PANAJI: Stating that only non-BJP ruled states had filed petitions before the Supreme Court to review its order on banning liquor shops and bars within 500m of national and state highways, the Congress accused the BJP of “covertly implementing its liquor prohibition policy all over India”. The party also demanded the resignation of chief minister Manohar Parrikar for failing to safeguard the interests of the  

 “Supreme Court has mentioned that states which were before the court to review the order are – Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. These states are not governed by the BJP. This government is not shying away to bring in the Gujarat model where prohibition on alcohol will be in place,” Margao MLA and senior Congress leader Digambar Kamat said, adding that “the situation in Goa may turn violent as people’s business is at stake”. 
 
 The party said that the previous government did not take any action against the decision when it was informed about it in December 2016. 
 
 “The Supreme Court has mentioned in its report that Goa is among the states which did not appeal against the verdict. Sikkim and Meghalaya got exemption from the ban citing their hilly topography. We could have also received it by citing that we have a coastline of 105km on one side, we are governed by CRZ guidelines and 38% of the total area is under forest cover. Two   are passing through the state and one of them is passing through all the towns,” Kamat said.
 
 Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco said that “chief minister Manohar Parrikar should take   for failing to address the issue and resign”. 
 
 “It is the   of BJP to have an alcohol-free state. The government is just doing an eyewash now as they did not take any decision when the order came in December,” Lourenco said.
