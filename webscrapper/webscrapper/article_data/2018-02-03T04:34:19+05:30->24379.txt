MUMBAI: Two scam hit departments of the BMC—roads and   —witnessed an increase in their   in the 2018-19 budget compared to the last fiscal. In a first, the BMC made a separate provision of Rs 1 crore to undertake the cement-concretization of   in all gaothan areas.

 The BMC allocated Rs 1,202 crore for roads department—last financial year, the allocation was Rs 1,078.61 crore—and Rs 566 crore for storm water drains department—last fiscal, it was Rs 446 crore. Surprisingly, the expenditure by these two departments in the current fiscal year is likely to exceed its allocation and, therefore, officials said their allocation for 2018-19 was increased. 
 
 In his budget speech, municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta said that as a result of better monitoring and expediting of projects, the BMC expects to spend Rs 1,175 crore on roads in 2017-18, as against the budget allocation of Rs 1,078 crore. Among the major projects proposed to be taken up are Saat Rasta beautification and a second exit to Bhandup station. In a push for the bridges department, to facilitate the foot over-bridge (FOB) use, the BMC has decided to provide escalators on skywalks that are under construction at Jogeshwari station and on the existing FOB at Kurla on an experimental basis. Technical feasibility is being checked to provide an escalator at Marine Drive FOB. 
 
 The budget pointed out that Hindmata is the most flood-prone spot and a box drain is proposed. It also focused on the 146 flooding spots identified in the heavy rain on August 29. These will be taken up on priority before rains; the BMC plans to fix 55 spots. In a first, a special allocation of Rs 53.71 crore was made to curb flooding at these spots.
