GURGAON: Residents of Sector 17C alleged that   water, which has been overflowing for the past 25 days, has now started entering their houses. According to the residents, nothing has been done about the issue, despite their repeated complaints to the civic agency and the CM complaints window.

 Narayan Aggarwal, a resident, said that the problem started after work on the flyover gathered pace at the nearby Maharana Pratap Chowk. 
 
 “The sewerage pipeline seems to be damaged by the ongoing work, and the sewers in our area have been overflowing ever since. We have lodged complaints with   multiple times, and have also registered a complaint at the CM window, but the problem has not been addressed. The overflowing sewer water has started entering our homes now,” Aggarwal said.
 
 Some residents complained about MCG’s indifference to residents’ issues. 
 
 “MCG is only interested in collecting property tax without providing any basic amenities to the residents. It is very frustrating that despite repeated complaints about this issue, we are only given false assurances that they will do something about it. It has been around 25 days and no action has been taken yet,” said Deepak Arora, a resident.
 
 An MCG official said the civic body was looking into the matter. “We are trying to identify the cause of the overflow, and are checking the sewerage pipelines to see if they are broken,” the official said.
