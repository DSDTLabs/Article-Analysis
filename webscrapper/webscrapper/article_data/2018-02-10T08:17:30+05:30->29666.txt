BHOPAL: The   of nearly 3 lakh applicants for 738 peon posts was an indication. Now, figures from the employment exchange show the grim truth — unemployment is rising alarmingly in Madhya Pradesh.

 Amid the pakoda wars, the number of   registering with the employment exchange has shot up from 15.6 lakh in 2015 to 23.7 lakh in 2017 — a shocking 53% in two years. The state economic survey, tabled in the assembly a day before the 2017 budget, painted a dismal picture, showing that only 129 people had got employment in 2016.
 
 
  
  
 
 It’s an indication that the government’s attempts at creating jobs through industrialization have not borne fruit, mostly because a significant percentage of MoUs signed by the government at global investor summits (GIS) failed to materialize, say sources. Till 2012, 1,751 MoUs worth Rs 11 lakh crore were inked on various occasions, including GIS. In 2014, the state did not use the word MoU and termed it ‘investment intents’ — 3,000 in all, adding up to over Rs 4 lakh crore.
 
 
 
 
 Addressing the inaugural session of GIS-2016 in Indore, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said Madhya Pradesh has attracted investment of Rs 2.75 trillion since 2014-GIS. “Of this, manufacturing has started at 110 plants. Around 175 food processing units and 92 renewable energy plants have been set up since 2014,” he had said. It doesn’t reflect on the job charts.
 
 A glimpse of the desperation for jobs was seen at the recent recruitment for peons in district courts. Engineers, law graduates and MBAs were among the 2.8 lakh aspirants — about 380 candidates were vying for every post. The highest number of applicants — 70,000 — were from Gwalior.
 
 Ajay Pawar, an unemployed MBA from Gwalior, said, “Where are the jobs. Which are these companies that have invested in MP, and how many MBA grads from the state have been employed by them?”
 
 RTI activist Akshay Hunka said, “The government’s claims ring hollow. This can be proved by the number of educated unemployed youth registering with employment exchanges across the state.” Hunka recently formed a ‘Berozgar Sena’ and demanded that the government enact a law to guarantee jobs to educated youth.
 
 Minister for industries and employment Rajendra Shukla holds out hope. The government has a target of generating 1 lakh jobs in the next year in Madhya Pradesh, he said.
 
 “Industrialisation in the state has yielded results. In Pithampur industrial estate alone, 250 companies have invested around Rs 12,000 crore, giving employment to around 12,000 people after the last GIS,” he said, adding: “This is a transitory period. Many more companies are coming to Madhya Pradesh and they will create more job avenues as more industrial areas are being developed. It would have been even worse had we not developed our irrigation capacity.”
