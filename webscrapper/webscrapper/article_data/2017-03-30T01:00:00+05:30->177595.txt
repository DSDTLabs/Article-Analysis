India’s first female wrestler to win a medal at  ,   will tie the knot on April 2, with her school sweetheart and fellow   wrestler,  . The preparations are on in full swing. Around 10,000 invitations have gone out and a special invitation has been extended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sakshi revealed, “PM sir ko maine invitation diya hai. Wohi sabse special hai.”

 Opening up on her feelings before the big day and her decision to get hitched, she says, “Jab bhagwan ne likh diya toh ussi time hona hai. Usse koi taal nahi sakta. Toh mera time tha abhi so abhi ho raha hai. Taiyyari chal rahi hai. Sochti hoon toh lagta hai, kuch zyada change honewala hai kya life mein? But abhi toh yeh hai ke mujhe bohot saal wrestling karni hai. Marriage is just a part of life; I will continue wrestling after that.”
 
 She adds, “My marriage is both love and arranged. Parents hi sab kuch arrange kar rahe hai. Woh (Satyawart) bhi Rohtak ke hi hai. Hum school mein 9th class se saath mein hain. We have been part of several competitions together and even bagged silver medals in Commonwealth Games on the same day.” Marrying someone from the same sport is certainly an advantage, believes the star wrestler. She explains, “Support hota hai. Agar mujhe training ka mann nahi kar raha or if I lose a competition, woh achche tarah se samajh sakta hai kyunki he has faced similar situations. If he feels low, I can motivate him as I am also a wrestler. It is good for both of us that we play the same sport.”
