Vadodara: Student leaders of MS University’s commerce faculty had altercations on Tuesday afternoon over hoardings of youth festival put up in the faculty by faculty general secretary (FGS). Former city unit president of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Zuber Khan Pathan reached the main building of the faculty on Tuesday afternoon when the youth festival was being inaugurated.  Pathan objected to the hoardings as names of two groups – NSUI and Revolutionary Students’ Union (RSU) – were mentioned there as organizers. Pathan had arguments with the FGS Vraj Patel. The issue was settled after senior NSUI leaders reached there. However, couple of hours later the class representatives (CR) of the faculty had altercations with supporters of Patel.  The CRs who belonged to Krishna group raised the issue why the name of their group was not mentioned on the hoardings. The arguments resulted in a scuffle because of which even the police was called. The police did not take any action and left after the situation was calmed down.
