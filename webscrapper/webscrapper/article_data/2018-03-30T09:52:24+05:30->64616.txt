CHENNAI: As a four-phase election process is underway to elect about 2 lakh office-bearers in more than 18,000 cooperative societies in  , the   refused to stall the exercise and, instead, dismissed a PIL that sought reservation for women and SC/STs in chairman posts.

 According to the petitioner, S Gnanasoundari, a member of agricultural co-operative society of Kokkaladi in Thiruvarur district, reservation had been provided to women and SC/ST communities only to director posts in cooperative societies, and not for chairman posts.
 
 She said director posts alone would not provide adequate opportunity to the target community as envisaged in the Constitution. She wanted the court to intervene in polls process and quash the election notification.
 
 Justice   made it clear that the election process which had already commenced could not be stalled and that the court would dismiss the plea as the main prayer itself was to stop the election. Similarly, five members of   society approached the high court alleging bias on part of the election officer.
