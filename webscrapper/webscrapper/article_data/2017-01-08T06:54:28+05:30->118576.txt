JAIPUR: The high-power committee constituted by the state government to study the special backward classes ( ) reservation issue would start its field survey in   district from Wednesday. This was decided during a meeting of social justice and empowerment minister Arun Chaturvedi with the committee members on Saturday at the secretariat.

 The government constituted a high-power committee under retired high court judge Justice Sunil Kumar Garg in the aftermath of the   scrapping 5% reservation to SBC on the ground that it not only violates the 50% cap of reservation set by the   but the SBC commission also failed to cite any extraordinary circumstances to warrant such a remedy.
 
 The Gujjar and the other four castes who were originally in the   list have been threatening the government of launching a fresh agitation as the community now neither enjoys the OBC nor the SBC reservation. They have been demanding 5% sub quota within the OBC so that the reservation limit is not violated again. However, the state government has been cagey as it fears reprisal from the dominant Jats whose inclusion in the OBC quota has resulted in the Gujjars and other communities demanding a separate quota. 
 
 Now, about 4,000 people belonging to SBC, who were selected under the quota in government jobs, are faced with the prospect of losing their jobs as the high court refused to stay the order passed by it.
 
  president and former Delhi MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri called mahapanchyat at Jantar Mandir in Delhi on January 15 while the Gujjars in Rajasthan are also gearing up for agitation.
 
 The Gujjars had accused the Raje government of failing to fulfil its promise of putting the special reservation to SBC in the IXth Schedule of the Constitution which would have made it outside the purview of judicial scrutiny.
