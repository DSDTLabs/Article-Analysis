It’s every director’s dream to helm a successful franchise. While Bollywood has seen many comedy franchises striking a chord with the audience, ‘Hate Story’ is perhaps the only series from the erotic revenge thriller genre to have tasted success at the box office. Director   says, “I am glad that after ‘Hate Story 2’, the audience’s response inspired me to make ‘Hate Story 3’ and now, ‘Hate Story IV’. As producers, T-Series has played a pivotal role in making the franchise something to look forward to.”

 ‘Hate Story IV’, starring  ,  ,  , Gulshan Grover and Ihana Dhillon, is touted to be inspired by true incidents. The plot, which promises unexpected twists and turns, revolves around two brothers (Karan and Vivan), who wage a war against each other for the love of the leading lady (Urvashi).
 
 Vishal adds, “The franchise has fared well at the box office because of its thrill elements, slick cinematography, musical score, picturesque song locations with the right dosage of erotica and innovative marketing strategies. This time around, the story unfolds in London and revenge gets darker.”
