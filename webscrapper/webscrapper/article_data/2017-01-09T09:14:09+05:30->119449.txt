In the second instance, the workshop was closed so there were no casualties reported,“ said  , district fire officer.
 
 Officials attributed both the fires to faulty electrical wiring systems. “Since the showroom had a lot of coir and dry grass lying around, the sparks from the   could have triggered the flames.
