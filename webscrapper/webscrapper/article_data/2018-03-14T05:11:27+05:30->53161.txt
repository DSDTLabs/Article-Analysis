MUMBAI: The family of slain former   corporator   has written to the joint commissioner of police saying that they fear for their safety. They have sought an investigation of Sawant's rival in the cable TV business. 

 Sawant was murdered on January 7 when he was returning home on a bike with an associate. The police arrested six people but the prime accused,   alias  , is on the run.
 
 Sawant's daughter, Prajakta, also a former corporator, wrote to joint commissioner (law and order) Deven Bharti. She said her father was the chairman of Samata Nagar Co-op Housing Societies Union in Mhada Colony at Thakur village. The colony is being redeveloped. 
 
 Sawant had ventured into the cable TV business and had secured rights to provide the service in buildings being constructed in the colony. "The police failed to unearth the larger conspiracy behind my father's murder. The motive given by those arrested in the case is vague and indigestible. The real cause of the killing was a struggle to gain supremacy in cable TV business," she wrote.
