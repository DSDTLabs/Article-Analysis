CHENNAI: The police on Sunday nabbed a three-man gang that looted a beauty parlour in   on Saturday night. 

 S Siddharth Raj, 24, of Pallavaram, Z  , 23, of Vadapalani and K Sudhakar, 26 of Kodambakkam, took a gold ring, four smartphones and 18,500 in cash at knifepoint from the four women working at the parlour. 
 
 Around 8.30pm on Saturday, the gang is said to have barged into the parlour, on Brindavan Street, West Mambalam, held the staffers, Gomathi, Abisha, Selvi and Anushree, all in their early 20s, at knifepoint, and robbed them after disconnecting the   facility. 
 
 However, the CCTV cameras were connected to the parlour owner  's phone. He alerted the police control room when the connection got cut right after he saw the trio enter the parlour. 
 
 Meanwhile, one of the staffers filed a complaint with the   police who initiated an investigation. Early on Sunday, a special team was conducting vehicle checks when they intercepted a two-wheeler at an intersection near Ashok Nagar 4th Avenue.
 
 Finding their behaviour suspicious, the police detained them. 
 
 Investigations revealed that the three men were petty thieves and were the same persons who had robbed the women at the beauty parlour on Saturday night. They were produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.
 
 The police recovered the stolen items, a two-wheeler and a weapon from the accused. Police said the trio targeted beauty parlours as most of them employed women, which they believed made it easy for them to rob.
