After many surveys and estimates in the last 10 years, Himachal Pradesh government is again showing its interest in building of Bhubhu Jot tunnel that will reduce distance by nearly 57km between Kullu and Mandi. Government has hired a consultant to make a fresh detailed project report (DPR) and prepare revised estimated cost to start the work soon. 

 On July 24, 2017, the ministry of road transport and highways had declared this proposed dream road a national highway. The tunnel, which will be about 3.2km long, will cut short distance between Kullu and Dharamshala or Pathankot by nearly 57km (two hours of drive). The road will start from Kullu and join Mandi-Pathankot road at Ghatasani via Lag valley, Bhubu Jot and Shilh-Bhadwani.
 
 As the Army convoy from Pathankot uses the road to reach Ladakh via Kullu-Manali, the tunnel will provide shortest and optional road for the forces. Passing through the picturesque and virgin landscapes, the road will not only facilitate the locals but also develop tourism in the area. Though Bhubhu Pass receives heavy snowfall in winters, the tunnel will make it an all-weather road.
 
 In 2009, the state BJP government had prepared a pre-feasibility report of the double-lane tunnel and estimated the cost at Rs 85 crore. The project file was reopened by Congress government in 2013. An Austrian company was hired to prepare its DPR and its cost was estimated at Rs 367.12 crore. 
 
 Transport minister Govind Singh Thakur said he held a meeting with officials of various departments to discuss various issues regarding tunnel to expedite the work. “Tender has been awarded to an agency to prepare feasibility and survey investigation report of the tunnel. The agency will start survey and estimation after approval from the union ministry. The tunnel will prove beneficial for many villages, entire state and tourism,” he said.
