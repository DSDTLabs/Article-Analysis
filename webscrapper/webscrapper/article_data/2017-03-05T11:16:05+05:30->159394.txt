INDORE: Indore Prime Route Bus Owners’   has opposed the government’s plan to restrict all 32-seater buses from plying outside the city limits saying this would affect their business and those ultimately suffering would be  .

  told TOI said this would be the third time the government is reducing the restriction area for these buses. “Earlier, we used to operate in a limit of 150km, which was later reduced to 75km. With this new restriction, we will be left with hardly 50km,” he said.
 
 Most operators have taken their vehicles on loan and if this new rule comes into effect, it would directly reduce their earnings.
 
 Home and transport minister Bhupendra Singh issued the directives during an assessment meeting of the transport department in Bhopal. Private bus operators feared losing business. As per the directives, 32-seater buses will not be issued permits for long routes and they would be restricted to ply within their respective city limits. These permits will be issued for only four months at a go and they will also be used for transportation in rural areas.
 
 Association members said more than sixty percent of their passengers travel to and from Indore to nearby districts. They said it would be impossible to survive with the new restriction. “This is injustice. On one hand they continuously reduce our operation limits, while on the other they provide subsidies to others to buy new buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission,” they said.
