NAGPUR: Nationalist   Party city president and ex-minister Anil Deshmukh sought to blame infighting in the Congress party and its failure to tie up a pre-poll alliance with the NCP for the poor show of both parties in NMC elections. “We will regroup and bounce back in the city, though we fared badly in NMC polls,” he said.

 “There was no coordination between different factions in the Congress party in the city. As a result, we could not strike an alliance for NMC polls. But precious time was lost in the process. We contested separately and there is a clear indication that division of secular votes hit the Congress in at least 30 seats while the NCP had to pay the price in 12 seats,” said Deshmukh in a media release. “This division ultimately helped the   win more seats,” he added.
 
 Interestingly, Deshmukh indicated that he would soon relinquish the city president post and hand it over to more able persons. Clearly, Deshmukh looks keen on concentrating on his Katol assembly constituency in the district, from where he has been elected for four terms — in 1995 as an independent and three terms as NCP nominee.
 
 He was minister in each term, and before that he was a   president (when it was accorded minister of state status), and thus enjoyed ministerial post for almost two decades, pursuing politics in rural area.
 
 The NCP contested 131 seats in NMC along with minor allies like RPI factions and Muslim League. They won only one seat, as Duneshwar Pethe emerged winner in East Nagpur’s ward 23. The party could garner less than 5% of total votes polled in NMC elections. This was its worst performance, as even in 2002, when it had gone alone, it had won more seats.
