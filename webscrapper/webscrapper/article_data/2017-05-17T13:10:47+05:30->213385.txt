GUWAHATI: The   on Tuesday sent three arrested   ( ) officials to   after they completed their 14-day police custody. 

 Special public prosecutor in the case, advocate Bijon Mahajan, said the court will take up the matter on May 30. 
 
 Bhaskar Jyoti Dev Sarma, Amrit Sarma and Bhaskar Dutta, all appointed as circle officers, were arrested on May 3 for allegedly getting selected in the civil service by paying hefty amount of money to the prime accused in the case, former   (APSC) chairman Rakesh Paul.
 
 Sources said during police interrogation, the trio revealed that they had paid around Rs 40 lakh to Paul for getting selected in the APSC exam illegally. During a police raid at Paul's residence, the trio's duplicate answerscripts were seized. Paul allegedly had given them opportunity to rewrite their papers at his home so that their marks can be manipulated. The trio were selected in 2013.
 
 They were jointly interrogated along with Paul inside the Central Jail campus during which the latter had reportedly threatened a police official on Saturday. "They (ACS officials) have disclosed several names involved in the cash-for-job scam. Many other answerscripts are currently undergoing forensic tests. Several arrests are expected soon," a source said. 
 
 On the other hand, Rakesh and arrested APSC member Samedur Rahman sought the court's intervention in barring the investigating agencies from giving statements in public domain or before the media which they alleged to be helping in forming public opinion against them. Paul's prayer has triggered a buzz that the accused was trying to gag the media.
