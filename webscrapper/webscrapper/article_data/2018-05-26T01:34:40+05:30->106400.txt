NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Friday   that nearly 50,000 people have   of services under its   schemes, which cover free high-end diagnostic services and surgeries at private facilities in case the same aren’t available at state-run hospital, or if there is long waiting time. 

 State health minister   said these included 14,834 MRIs and 5,988 CT scans conducted from March 2017 to February 2018. Additionally, 1,615 people had undergone free surgeries at private hospitals in the corresponding period.
 
 State health minister Satyendar Jain said the number of beneficiaries is likely to go up further due to increased awareness about the schemes. “It is the government’s duty to provide adequate health facility to people. Because the existing infrastructure in government hospital isn’t sufficient to provide that, we have introduced the two schemes where people can be referred to select private facilities for tests, or even surgeries. The government will reimburse the cost incurred at subsidised rates,” Jain said.
 
 Under the free surgery scheme, the state government is currently facilitating 52 specified surgeries for free at private hospitals in Delhi/NCR. There is no income limit for residents of Delhi; those who are allotted a date of surgery after 30 days of diagnosis at one of the 24 specified government hospitals in the city may avail of the scheme. “More than 50 hospitals have agreed to do free surgery at rates agreeable to us. More hospitals are in talks with similar offers,” Jain said. He added that the government had also introduced another scheme for free treatment to accident victims even at private hospitals under which 300 people have been treated.
