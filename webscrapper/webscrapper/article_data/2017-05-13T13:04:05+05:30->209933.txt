VADODARA: M S University on Friday   that it has agreed to surrender land opposite Experimental School to the   (VMC). 

 Making its stand clear on the land row, MSU issued an official statement clarifying that it has not agreed to part away with any piece of land. 
 
 “Neither vice-chancellor nor syndicate nor committee formed to look into land issues nor the construction division has given any written or verbal consent to VMC regarding surrendering any land of the university of any campus to VMC,” university engineer   said. The VMC too has been surprised by the reports. VMC commissioner Dr   said that there had been no interaction with the MSU since around 20 days. “There has been no meeting with anybody on the land issue,” said Rao. 
 
 The VMC had earlier decided not to press for the MSU land in the road line.
 
  It has cleared other spaces in the road line leaving the MSU compound wall untouched. The VMC has also clarified that any development will only be done with MSU’s consent and involvement.
 
 Ojha clarified that the university has received no response from VMC to its letter dated April 21 through which it had made it clear that it will not allow VMC to take away its prime parcel of land in the name of “encroachment”.
 
 “Till date, we have not received any official response from VMC’s side to our last letter. So the question of giving consent to surrender or part with any piece of land does not exist,” said Ojha. Through its letter, the university had sought a “request letter” from the corporation seeking clear details on the parcels of land it requires from the university, the cost of the land required by it and cost of compensating land that the university will get in exchange.
