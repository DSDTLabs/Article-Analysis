SANTINIKETAN: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed became the first person to write on the new edition of ‘Kheyal Khata’. She was followed by Prime Minister  . ‘Kheyal Khata’ is the visitors’ notebook that used to be kept at Udayan Bari at Santiniketan, where Tagore spent the better part of his life.

 
 The visitors’ book was christened ‘Kheyal Khata’ by  , who was Tagore’s illustrious nephew. The name was so because visitors were encouraged to scribble random thoughts.
 
 
  
 
 All the special guests to Visva-Bharati were requested to scribble in it during their visit to the university and the Uttarayan complex, which comprises houses that Tagore got built and where he took turns to live. Udayan Bari is the largest of these houses and is packed with Tagore memorabilia.
 
 The original ‘Kheyal Khata’ could not be used because it got damaged by acid in the pages. Even the leather binding done by   has been damaged. Since VB was to received two PMs on Friday, it decided to introduce a new edition. After the two PMs paid their respects to Tagore in the front room of Udayan Bari, they were requested to write in the notebook.
 
 Modi requested the Bangla PM to write first, as a matter of courtesy. She wrote in Bengali and signed her name, after which Modi wrote his message in Hindi. Sheikh Hasina wrote about how Tagore inspires her and how well Santiniketan archives its documents and memorabilia. Modi, on the other hand, wrote about Tagore’s exalted philosophy and how it is a timeless inspiration to the ‘yuva’ (youth) of the country.
 
 The new edition of ‘Kheyal Khata’ contains imported paper so that acid doesn’t destroy the book anymore. Instead of leather binding, the typical Santiniketan curtain cloth has been used. The Bangla PM skipped the first page and wrote on the second. PM Modi wrote on the third page. The book immediately went back to the strong room and will be brought back again for the next illustrious visitor.
