  Yashodhara Raje Scindia, who wore a blue sari at the polo match, seemed to have inspired a few other young women, who chose to be in a chiffon sari and gave the usual dress-and-hat a miss. "I used to be a rider and I always wondered when the day would come when I could wear informal clothes to a polo match. But then, you have to keep the tradition alive in polo. Wearing a sari at a polo match is something we have continued as a tradition," Yashodhara Raje said.

 The young polo players, like   from the Jaipur royal family, impressed everyone with their performance. "It is good to see these young players, who are passionate about the game and are taking their legacy and love for polo ahead. As we complete 20 years of this tournament, it is really great to see these young boys here. This tournament was started when KR Narayanan was our president and Atal ji was the prime minister and my mother was alive," added Yashodhara Raje.
