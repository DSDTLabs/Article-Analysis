AHMEDABAD: A research conducted at   suggested that   will remain loyal to herbal products and the   can continue making steady investments in developing herbal category in the product lines.

 The survey, conducted by taking nearly 458 responses from two cities — Ahmedabad and Bangalore — and also from some rural parts, stressed that the brands will be more successful if they focus on communicating the benefits of herbal products rather than focusing on “swadeshi” plank.
 
 “The results establish that consumers' belief on herbal products has a stronger impact on brand affect and brand trust, which further influences brand loyalty,” stated the study “Measuring the effect of consumer ethnocentrism and consumer beliefs for herbal products on brand loyalty: A study of Indian   sector” conducted by associate professor of   and Strategies, Jay Trivedi.
 
 Indian market has seen a lot of fads and trends. Currently, Indian consumers are buying a lot of herbal products. On these lines, FMCG companies are investing into developing herbal brands and production capacity, says the study.
 
 “My research has taken up questions like, if these investments will give loyal consumers to the brands or will this ‘herbal’ category prove to be a fad in the market? The second topic my research focused on was positioning products on ‘herbal’ and ‘swadeshi’ planks. I have studied which of these matters most to the consumers,” said Trivedi.
 
 The results suggest that Indian consumers are going to remain loyal to herbal products. Hence this will emerge as a trend in the Indian market. “Indian consumers are focusing on the benefits they get by using herbal products and are not much influenced by the products coming from domestic manufacturers. This helps us infer that Indian consumers will also accept herbal products from   FMCG companies,” he said.
