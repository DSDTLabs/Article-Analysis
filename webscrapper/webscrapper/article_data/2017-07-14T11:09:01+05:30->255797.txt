BHOPAL: Conservationists have criticised the Centre for slashing the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of   in   from 10km to a mere 100 metres, and demand that it should be at least 1km in radius. 

 The decision to cut the ESZ radius was taken by the ministry of environment and forest while reviewing the issue in Delhi on July 7. The issue was pending for five years. Though it was never practical for a protected forest area like   that is situated inside a city, the idea of ESZ was in force since 2002. Van Vihar was declared a national park in 1983. RTI activist Ajay Dube, whose petition in high court forced the Centre to define buffer zones of national parks, criticised the decision and demanded that ESZ be increased to 1km.
 
 Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Jitendra Agrawal said, "Rala Mandal of Indore and Bhopal's Van Vihar will have an ESZ of 100m as they are not typical protected forest areas but fenced forests. Neither do animals move out of the park, nor do they enter the park from some forest corridor. Though the ministry has taken the decision, the notification is yet to be issued. Till it is done, the 10km rule of ESZ will continue."
 
 It was on January 21, 2002, that a wildlife conservation strategy was adopted at a meeting of the National Board of Wildlife. "It was decided that land within 10km of the boundaries of national parks and sanctuaries should be notified as eco-fragile zones under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Environment Protection Rules, 1986," a forest department source said.
