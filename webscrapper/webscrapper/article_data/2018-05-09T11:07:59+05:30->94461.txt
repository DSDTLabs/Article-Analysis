KOLKATA: Carcass meat kingpin Biswanath Ghorui alias   has claimed that at least 40% of the meat that was processed at his cold storages would reach the   through a meat trader, who was once his business ally but fled ever since the scam came to fore. Ghorui, though, remained evasive when asked if the entire meat was picked from the dumping grounds or included dead chicken too.

 Police also said   was apparently upset that his business model was ruined even as his competitors managed to avoid the police dragnet. “He has told us that this meat trader used to buy meat from another source in the   area. We need to ascertain these claims backed with evidence before commenting,” claimed a special investigation team officer. The SIT team had even raided the New Market area on Monday but did not achieve much success in nabbing this trader.
 
  
 This is the first time that Ghorui has admitted to have played a major role in supplying stale meat to the city leading to the investigators launching a manhunt for this trader. The accused was produced at the   court on Tuesday where his police custody was extended by another nine days.
 
 The claims of Ghorui assume significance in the light of the police probe in the past two days. “We have recovered Rs 94 lakh from his two separate accounts with the Bhowanipore branch of a private bank. Our probe has found that there were certain crucial transactions within family members. At present, we are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of his kin,” said SP (South 24 Parganas) Koteswar Rao.
 
 The police have also interrogated others arrested in this case. Based on their statements, a list with details of the vehicles in which the meat was transported to different parts of the state has been prepared.
 
 Meanwhile,   officials raided the unit of a reputable food chain located in a Bhowanipore mall on Tuesday. Officials of   and Dm Dum Municipality also collected samples from eateries under their jurisdiction.
