KOLKATA: CM   is likely to visit China this June to woo investors. This will be her fifth foreign visit in the past three years. She has previously visited Singapore, Dhaka, London and Italy-Germany. Representatives of the Chinese government have made several visits to Bengal in the past two years and extended invitation to Mamata to visit the country.

 Speaking to the media at the airport on her return from Delhi, the CM said: “Amra sombhoboto jete pari. Ora barbar anu rodh korche. Biniyog korar katha bolchhe(We may go to China.They are repeatedly requesting us. They are interested in investment).“ However, sources in the state secretariat said the CM has already given her consent to the visit in early June.
 
 Though the details of the tour is yet to be finali sed, Mamata is likely to visit the two provinces of Jiangsu and Yunan. Both the provinces on different occasions have shown interest in investing in Bengal, particularly in food processing and automobile sectors. Finance minister Amit Mitra and a host of in dustrialists from the state are likely to accompany the CM to China. Healthcare, tourism and IT are some of the sectors where business dialogues can happen along with manufacturing.

 In November 2015, Chinese vice-president Li Yuanchao during a visit to Kolakta had met the CM and requested her to visit China. Yuanchao had not only promised the state loans from the  , but Chinese automobile major Zhongtong had promised to set up an assembling unit in Andal.
 
 In February this year, the consul-general of China in Kolkata, Ma Zhanwu, too, invited Mamata to visit Jiangsu and Yunan.
