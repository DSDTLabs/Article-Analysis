MUMBAI: The state government on Wednesday told the Bombay high court that underworld threat perception is not over in Mumbai as seen in the arrest of  , fugitive don  's brother.

 It was responding to a bench headed by the chief justice which directed it to “re-visit“ its circular of 2000 regarding grant of police protection to persons other than constitutional functionaries and VVIPs. It has also to state “what action it proposes to take“.
 
 Government pleader   was replying to the court's observation that societal problems in Mumbai are peculiar. “In 11 years of practice in Karnataka, I have come across two cases [of police protection],“ said Chief Justice (CJ) Manjula Chellur.
 
 Vagyani said the 2000 circular was issued because of gang wars and crime syndicates.
 
 “Maybe the circular was issued because of that situation.Whether that situation still continues?“ asked the CJ. Vagyani said, “Dawood's brother was arrested yesterday .“
 
 The court heard a PIL by advocate Sunny Punamiya to recover police protection dues from private citizens. The bench reiterated that protection should not be given on mere recommendation unless the re is danger to life. “We are not saying do not give but not for the sake of asking. Poorest of poor citizen, if he requires, should also be given. Even richest of rich. It is the obligation of the state,“ said the CJ. The bench said the police cannot be treated as private security guards. “It affects their morale.“
 
 The judges also said that if over 1,000 policemen were not diverted they would work for common people. “Suppose there is some emergency or disaster situation like floods expected today . If it continues, everything will come to a standstill. You call every police personnel. Can you say they (protection police) are not meant for action?“ the CJ asked.
