GANDHINAGAR:  , leader of opposition in the state assembly, is going on a one-week foreign trip. Strangely, this too has triggered speculation about his returning to the BJP.

 The senior Congress leader had given rise to similar rumours when he recently ‘unfollowed’ all Congress leaders, including   vice-president Rahul Gandhi on social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram among others.
 
 “I am going abroad to attend an ex-MPs meeting,” he said. “It’s a personal visit and has nothing to do with politics. I will come back only after Prime Minister   finishes his two proposed visits to Gujarat. I want to avoid a controversy.”
