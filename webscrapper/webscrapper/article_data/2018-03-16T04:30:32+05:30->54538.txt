NEW DELHI: The Delhi Transport Corporation on Thursday floated tenders for procurement of 1,000 buses. They might, however, hit the roads only by next year, a source said.

 The Delhi government had last year announced induction of 2,000 buses — 1,000 each for   and cluster scheme.
 
 “The move is another firm step of the government towards increasing buses and strengthening public transport,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.
 
 The buses would be standard floor and non-air-conditioned, which would be delivered in batches between three and nine months, a DTC official said. The last date for application is April 12, the tenders would then be opened on May 10 and successful bidder will be chosen. 
 
 “The buses will come with a warranty of three years or 2.10km travel, whichever is earlier,” the official said. After the allotment of the  , the successful bidder would have to deliver a   prototype within three months. Once the prototype is approved, 40 buses would have to be delivered within four months, he said. 
 
 “The next batch of 120 buses will arrive between five and 12 months and in the next 12 months, the procurement of 1,000 buses will have to be completed,” the official said.
 
 Of the 1,000 buses, 100 would be added to Rewla Khanpur, 250 to Dwarka Sector 22, 120 to Kharkhari Nahart, 90 buses to Bawana Sector 1, 160 to Rani Khera-I depot and 140 each to Rani Khera-II and Rani Khera-III depots. Work at these upcoming depots is at an advanced stage.
 
 In December, 2017, the Supreme Court had directed that Delhi should have 10,000 buses by the end of 2018. Currently, Delhi has about 5,500 buses with DTC having a fleet of 3,944 buses and 1,612 Cluster scheme buses operated by DIMTS. Delhi needs 10,000 to 11,000 buses to meet the transport demands of the city.
