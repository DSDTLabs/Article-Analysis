THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government on Friday removed DGP   from the post of director of vigilance and anti-corruption bureau ( ) in the wake of repeated adverse remarks from the Kerala high court against the agency. Jacob Thomas, who has not been given any other post, has been asked to go on leave.

 The charge of vigilance director has been handed over to state police chief Loknath Behera. According to sources, the government decided to remove Thomas after he put it in an embarrassing position by sending a report on the Jisha murder case that the police findings were far from the truth. Subsequently, the high court also remarked on Wednesday why the vigilance director was not removed from the post as he was interfering in matters beyond his powers.
 
 The report against Thomas by additional chief secretary (finance) K M Abraham is under consideration of the high court, and another report on his illegal assets in Virudhunagar in  , exposed by TOI, is expected to be submitted before the court soon. A self-proclaimed anti-corruption crusader, Thomas was brought in by the   government as vigilance director with much fanfare.
