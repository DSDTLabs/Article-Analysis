MARGAO: Upset that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swacch Bharat Abhiyan is not being implemented at the newly-constructed Sulabh toilet in the   (SGPDA) complex, Margao, the   ( ) on Wednesday undertook a novel approach, presenting a rose to those urinating in public outside the facility.

 Urging SGPDA authorities to wake up and curb this menace, SCM convener   told mediapersons that since the past 20 days, SCM members Radha Kavlekar, Elvis Fernandes, Melwin Fernandes, Laurel Abranches and Coutinho had attempted to create awareness among the public about utilising the newly-constructed toilet near the asphalted parking lot.
 
 “Despite our requests, several people, specifically vendors and traders, choose to urinate in front of this facility provided to them. These nuisance-makers are least concerned about the public in the busy market area. The government spends crores of rupees on Swacch Bharat Abhiyan but it is sad that SGPDA authorities have failed to dissuade those urinating in the open. The government should work out an arrangement with the sulabh authorities to allow the public free use of urinals as finding adequate change (coins) is a problem,” said Coutinho.
 
 Many women, embarrassed with people urinating in public at the SGPDA market, praised the SCM’s novel protest.
