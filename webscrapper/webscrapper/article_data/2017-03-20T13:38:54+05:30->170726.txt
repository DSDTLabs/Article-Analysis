Nayanthara is one among the few lucky actresses to have a long and commendable career down south, her personal relationships not withstanding. 

 After her alleged comeback post break-up with choreographer-turned-director and actor Prabhu Deva, Nayanthara has her hands full with projects that brought out her mettle. With back-to-back hits and tailor made characters, Nayan is sure going to enjoy another decade of her film career. The actress also seemingly is in a blissful relationship with her 'Nanum Rowdy Than' director Vignesh Sivan, and did not try to hide her relationship status.
 
 With the continuing trend of horror flicks, Nayan too had her hands at a couple of them, which saw success and won critical acclaim at the box office. The next in line, 'Dora' is that of a role where Nayan is haunted by a car that is possessed by a ghost. With a very interesting first look and equally intriguing teaser, the makers of 'Dora' have created quite a buzz around the film.
 
 Directed by Doss Ramaswamy, the movie in Telugu is being released by Malkapuram Sivakumar and will hit the screens on March 31.
