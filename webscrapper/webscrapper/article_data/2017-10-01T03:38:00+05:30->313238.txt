Mapusa: The Corjuem and Calvim bridges in Aldona could soon come under closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance following incidents of damages to electrical fixtures.  Locals raised concern that about bridges being poorly maintained, and in the absence of any illumination, miscreants creating a nuisance under the cover of darkness. Following these complaints, Aldona MLA Glenn Souza Ticlo, along with officials of the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), electricity department, public works department (PWD) and members of the Aldona panchayat conducted a joint inspection of the bridges on Friday. They found that electrical fixtures have been deliberately damaged on both the bridges. Beer bottles were also found strewn around. Ticlo said that he will approach chief minister Manohar Parrikar to demand the installation of CCTV cameras.  With regards to Corjuem bridge, Ticlo said, “There is a technical issue that needs to be resolved as the bridge was constructed by GSIDC, but they are yet to hand it over to the PWD. Subsequently, the electricity department was supposed to take responsibility of maintenance works. That’s why the illumination issue has not been resolved. To make matters worse, miscreants have been damaging the electrical fixtures.” Ticlo added that around 40 junction boxes were repaired on the Calvim bridge, but the lighting has failed as the power cables were burnt by some miscreants. “Police have been instructed to undertake patrolling in these areas. But when miscreants spot the cops, they run away, only to return later and damage public property. Hence, there is a need for CCTV cameras so that these people can be nabbed,” he said.
