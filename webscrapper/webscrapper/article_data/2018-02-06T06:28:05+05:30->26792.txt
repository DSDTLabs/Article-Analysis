GUNJA, MEHSANA:  , about 5km from Vadnagar, PM Narendra Modi’s home town, cannot but marvel at the 16th century lake, on the eastern side of the village, which has a pathway leading to the centre of the lake where ruins of ancient temple are situated. The original temple had an open mandapa with rectangular porches on three sides and highly ornate pillars. The lake however was an eyesore just a year ago. Its banks littered with garbage from the village’s 7,000 residents and its waters dirtied by unchecked activities.

 “I came back from my service in the Indian Army and was active in social service. I saw the abysmal condition of this age-old gem and decided to do my bit. After my morning namaaz, I would start cleaning the stone boundary of the lake and cleaning slime and dirt from the structures,” recounts  , now in early sixties. He worked relentlessly and was noticed by villagers. They first made fun of his efforts, but later joined him when he spoke about conserving their heritage and the water body. He was supported by Nasir Ahmed Pathan, a retired policeman and others.
 
 Suresh Chaudhari, sarpanch of the village, said local legend puts the lake’s construction in the Solanki era, when a wealthy Nagar man called Nanak commissioned it. “The lake has the same architectural style seen in places like Vadnagar and some of the idols found from here have been housed at the museum in Vadnagar.” he said.
 
 About 150 of the villagers joined hands on Jauary 26 to clean the lake and its surroundings when a team from the   (ASI)’s excavation branch, working at Vadnagar, took up a cleanliness mission at the location.
