There’s nothing like bonding over food, and   (former Miss India) will vouch for it. A self-confessed foodie, the actress also enjoys sharing delicious khana with her friends and colleagues. It was no different on the sets of her upcoming romcom, for which she is currently shooting alongside   and   in Mumbai. In between the shoot, Rakul had to fly down to Hyderabad for a day to fulfill a professional commitment and she didn’t let go of the opportunity to taste the city’s famous biryani.

 Rakul, who has always been a fan of the lip-smacking dish, decided to carry some for her colleagues back in the bay as well. What added to the jashn was Tabu, a true blue Hyderabadi girl, also getting some home-cooked biryani for everyone. 
 
 Soon, it turned out to be one big feast on the set, as the entire crew, dug into the scrumptious spread.
