CHENNAI: Police have sent show-cause notices to at least 100 students studying in city colleges, asking them why police shouldn’t initiate action against them for triggering anti-NEET protests in the city.

 Police said they had identified students affiliated to Students’ Federation of India (SFI), Revolutionary Students’ Youth Federation (RSYF) and other student outfits, who led the agitations held recently in the city, with the help of photographs and video footage collected from television channels and other sources. Police said they had also taken photographs and videos of some protests.
 
 If the summoned students failed to appear before police, they can be levied a fine of Rs5,000 or can be remanded in prison for six months, said a police officer. 
 
 A senior police officer said, “This is not to harass the students. We have not all issued notices to normal protesters and students.” Inquiries revealed that students who have participated in various agitations trigger the crowd to stage protests and to block roads. They try to breach the law and order situation in the city, the officer added.
 
 Summoned students should appear before the concerned police officials and should give a binding promising they will not indulge in any such protests or agitations in the next six months under Section 107 of the CrPC. 
 
 Another police officer said, “If the student violates the undertaking and is proved to have taken part or led any agitation, they can be remanded in prison. They have to undergo a jail term for six months.”
