TRICHY: The area under rice cultivation in Tamil Nadu fell by nearly 40% to 17.95 lakh acres so far in the 2016-17 rabi season, as per data released by the Union agriculture ministry.

 According to the   (ICAR), an agency under the ministry, 29.55 lakh acres was the coverage last year. The report also said apart from paddy, pulses acreage has also declined to 8.7 lakh acres as against 9.85 lakh acres last year. Even coarse cereals coverage was lower at 8.88 lakh acres from 10.58 lakh acres, while oilseeds coverage fell to 95,000 acres from 2.23 lakh last year. Total rabi crop coverage was 37.7 lakh acres, down by 30% from 53.55 lakh acres in the last period.
 
 Secretary of Thanjavur District   Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R   said that the report should goad the Union government to announce TN as a drought-hit state. “This has happened not only because of failure of monsoon but also due to water not flowing in the Cauvery,“ Vimalnathan stressed. Only a combination of ground water, Cauv ery water and monsoon can ensure a good harvest. But this year all the three failed in Tamil Nadu, said general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers' Welfare Association Mannargudi S Ranganathan.
 
 “The report has clearly said that the failure of monsoon has impacted our neighbouring states like Karnataka and   but not to the extent of Tamil Nadu. So if the Union government will announce Tamil Nadu as drought-hit based on the reality and ICAR report, we will be happy,“ he added.
 
 Ministers who visited and assessed crop damage and water condition in delta districts had promised relief to farmers. “Let us hope something positive would happen,“ he said.
