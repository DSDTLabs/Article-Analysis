HYDERABAD: A 28-year-old teacher immolated himself and later leapt off the terrace of his apartment in Hayathnagar on Wednesday. 

 The victim, Shiva Shankara Brahmachary from Srinivasapuram Colony in Hayathnagar was working as a private tutor for high school students. 
 
  Shiva left home in the morning after informing his mother that he was going to Ameerpet. At 3.20 pm, Shiva returned to his flat on the fourth floor of Sai Sudha Apartment.
 
 He placed the backpack in his bedroom, picked up a kerosene can from the kitchen, locked the flat's main door from outside and then went to the terrace, Hayathnagar inspector   said. 
 
 On the terrace, Shiva doused himself with kerosene and set himself on fire using a cigarette lighter. "He ran from corner to corner for a while. He leapt off the terrace unable to withstand the pain," the inspector said. Shiva died on the spot. Residents of the apartment alerted Hayathnagar police who reached the spot and sent the body to Osmania General Hospital (OGH)for post-mortem. 
 
 During preliminary probe, police found out that Shiva was upset over his strained relationship with girlfriend. Shiva's father   is an advocate at   district court in LB Nagar. 
 
  Shiva is survived by his parents and three siblings. In his complaint to the police, Muthyam Chary alleged that his son committed suicide due to the harassment of his lover and her parents. 
 
 "The complainant alleged Shiva's lover's parents had set a condition that they will agree for the marriage only if he promised to take care of them. As per the complaint, Shiva was upset with the conditions and ended his life," the inspector said. Based on the complaint, the police registered an abetment to commit suicide case under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
