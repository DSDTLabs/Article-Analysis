MUMBAI: The municipal corporations of Mumbai and Thane on Tuesday told the   that there are "in-house" qualified persons to advice the civic commissioners before he sanctions felling of trees and that courts exist to stop him from abusing the power. 

 They were responding to petitions challenging an amendment to the Trees Act, which allows the commissioner to sanction felling of trees up to 25. Beyond 25, the proposal has to be sent to the tree authority. On February 21, the HC restrained the commissioners from granting any permissions except in extreme emergencies wherein life and property are endangered. On Monday, a bench of Justice Abhay Oka had asked if the commissioners will take help of experts before permitting felling of trees, publish their decision "in some form" and not act upon it for a while so that citizens can challenge it.
 
 Senior advocate   for BMC said that before taking a decision, the commissioner will take advice and opinion of qualified people in the garden department. "We have everything available in house," he said, adding that the commissioner will wait for seven days after posting a decision on the civic portal and publishing its summary in newspapers. Senior advocate  , had a ditto reply. 
 
 Both advocates were vociferous that the HC must not stay the amendment as there are "sufficient guidelines" and the procedure for the commissioner to follow is same as that of the tree authority, which includes site visit and a report to be made. "Possible abuse is hypothetical. If there is abuse of power, courts are there to stop him," said Sakhare.
