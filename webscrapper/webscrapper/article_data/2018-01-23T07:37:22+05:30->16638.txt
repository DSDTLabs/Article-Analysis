MUMBAI: The bull run on   continued on Monday with the sensex closing 286 points up at 35,798, while the NSE   inched closer to the psychologically important 11k mark, ending the session at 10,966 — up 72 points. 

 Index heavyweights Reliance and TCS, along with a host of banking stocks, led the rally, while   and Bharti were among the laggards. Dealers said the 4.5% rise in RIL was attributed to Jio, its telecom arm, turning in a net profit during the October-December quarter. 
 
 Among the banking stocks,   rose 3.5% after the bank said the pace of creation of non-performing assets had slowed during the past quarter. Investors are upbeat on better than expected quarterly earnings numbers by most of the top Indian companies while the positive mood across global markets is also helping the rally. 
 
 According to   Mutual Fund’s senior fund manager (equities) Karthikraj Lakshmanan, shares of realty, energy, IT and capital goods companies were among the top gainers in Monday’s trade following the unexpected positive news flow on October-December corporate results. Market players, however, cautioned that trading is likely to turn choppy, which was confirmed by the spurt in India VIX, an indicator of volatility. Rising global crude oil prices could also hit market sentiment, dealers said. 
 
 Like in the recent past, the day’s trading was again led by foreign fund buying, while domestic funds mostly sold. End of the session data showed that FPIs were net buyers at Rs 1,568 crore, while domestic institutions were net sellers at Rs 462 crore.
