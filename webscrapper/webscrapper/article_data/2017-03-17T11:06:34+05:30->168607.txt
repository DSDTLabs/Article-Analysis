NAINITAL: In what has been called as one of the most challenging and swiftest operations by the forest department, a tiger was tranquilised and captured five hours after it killed a woman and possibly mauled to death a member of her family at Bailpadav range in   in Nainital district. The attacks, seen as quite unprecedented, saw 33-year-old Bhagwati, a resident of   village, attacked by the six-year-old male tiger when she was returning home with fodder for her cattle. The woman had gone to the forests adjoining Dabka bridge near the range. Her 52-year-old relative,  , was subsequently dragged when he, along with a few others, had rushed to her rescue. While the body of the woman has been found, search is on for the other victim who is feared dead.

 The operation involving 50 people, including forest personnel and a veterinary officer, an elephant, an earthmover, 50 camera traps and two cages came to an end around 4 pm. Parag  , conservator of forests, Terai West circle, who led the search operation, said, “It was one of the most challenging and quickest operations till date. The tiger has been tranquilised and transported to the Nainital zoo. It will be kept under observation.” 
 
 “There were two tranquilising teams who combed the area on an elephant. The big cat attacked us while we mounted the earthmover. Two tranquiliser shots were fired at it,” said  , senior veterinary officer at the Pt G B Pant High Altitude Zoo in Nainital town.
