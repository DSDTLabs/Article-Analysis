 The new fleet includes 300 ordinary low fare buses, 30 Volvo coaches and 250 ordinary buses. Besides, there is also a plan to make global positioning system (GPS) mandatory for both state-run and private buses.
 
 Punjab transport minister Aruna Chaudhary on Friday asked officers of the transport department to rein in private bus operators. Secretaries of the regional transport authorities have been asked to ensure the timely meeting of targets with regard to the collection of taxes and implementation of latest IT systems for issue of registration certificates and driving licences.
 
 The minister further said that the process of buying buses is going on. The minister also assured that the public transport authorities would be given more teeth and new routes would commence for the far-flung and deprived regions.
 
 Secretaries of the regional transport authorities have been asked to put a stop to the arbitrariness of the private bus operators apart from ensuring that every bus operates according to an equitable time table. Besides, no bus should operate from the unauthorised stops or on routes without permits.
 
 To ensure this, it would be mandatory for private buses to install GPS. Besides, new as well as the old government buses would also be equipped with the GPS technique. This would come in handy for the departmental officers to have full knowledge of the route taken by the buses.
