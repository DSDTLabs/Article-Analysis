DHARAMSHALA: A few magic words from former India leggie and commentator   was all the motivation chinaman sensation   needed to turn in a memorable performance on Test debut. Now, with India fighting to draw parity in the decider, the pressure is on Kuldeep to come up with an encore.

 Sivaramakrishnan, now an astute analyst who too broke into the Indian cricket scene as a spin-bowling wunderkind back in the 1980s, was asked by coach   to hand over the Test cap to 22-year-old Yadav on Saturday morning.
 
 “Kuldeep was a bit emotional and I told him to focus on his own strengths, not think about the batsman's strengths. I told him to bowl a lot of good balls. I told him modern batsmen lack a good defence and aren't used to defending for long periods. If you can keep it steady and keep bowling those good balls, the wickets will follow,” Sivaramakrishnan told TOI a day after Kuldeep's bag of tricks sparked an Australian collapse.
 
 Siva, whose own career sputtered to a halt after an immensely promising start, believes Kuldeep has it in him to go the distance.
 
 “In terms of skill, he is definitely a long-term prospect. But he has to watch out for a few things. First off, there will be too many people giving him advice after this early success. He must avoid too many gurus. He has to know which ones to listen to and which to discard. I believe Anil Kumble should guide his career from here on. He must pick Kumble's brains, learn how to focus.
 
 “I have been following Kuldeep since the 2014 Champions League T20 and I'm very impressed. His lengths are immaculate. His control is consistent. He is confident of executing such a difficult art. But the more he plays, the more batsmen will get used to playing him. His variations are the key, and he has to keep working on them. His flipper needs more work.”
