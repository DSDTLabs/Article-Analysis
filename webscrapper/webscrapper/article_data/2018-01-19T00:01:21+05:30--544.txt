Kochi: The high court will consider the question whether a   can be classified as a motor vehicle. Such a question is being considered by the court after a Pala-based contractor filed a petition questioning a notice issued by the joint   of Pala for levying road tax on a roadroller being used by his company.

 The roadroller, technically called an asphalt compactor, that is being used by the contractor was manufactured by Volvo, bearing the model number DD90. It has two metal wheels and is only used for compacting asphalt and bitumen, the petition said.
 
 While so, the joint RTO inspected the work site of the contractor on November 29 and issued a check report stating that the roadroller is required to be registered and road tax should be paid at 6% of the purchase value. An allegedly exorbitant fine was also imposed. Later, a demand notice was issued by the RTO instructing the contractor to compulsorily register the roadroller.
 
 Questioning the demand notice, the contractor has now contended that a roadroller does not fulfil the definition of a motor vehicle. As per Section 2 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory or in any other enclosed premises need not be registered, the petition said.
 
 Referring to a 2005 court ruling, the contractor argues that only those vehicles fitted with inflated tyres need to be registered.
 
 Producing photographs of the roadroller, the contractor points out that the construction equipment does not satisfy the distinctive characteristics of a motor vehicle, as specified in the Motor Vehicles Act. The equipment runs fully on metal wheels and is not adapted or suitable for use on road. It is transported from one work site to another by mounting on a truck.
 
 Considering the petition, the court has issued a stay on the demand notice.
