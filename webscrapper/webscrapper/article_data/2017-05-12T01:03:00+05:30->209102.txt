What would you do if your groom-to-be vanishes in the middle of your   day without prior notice? You would probably have a panic attack, shriek your head off and list all the times he has disappointed you by being this irresponsible. Well, not this bride. When Amisha Bhardwaj’s groom left the venue to explore  , the destination of their wedding, she was angry thinking they would get late for the sunset-pheras. However, her amazing photographer friends, Surpreet Kaur and Pavandeep Singh, turned it into one of the best memories from her wedding. “I told her to chill with her bridesmaids, and take it slow while getting ready for the ceremony. Since we now had time, I suggested shooting a quirky   and she readily agreed,” says Surpreet. And that’s how the desi  , dancing to Sia’s   in her choli, chudha and shorts, went viral. So, it wasn’t rehearsed? “Oh no, it was absolutely organic. She is an beautiful and confident woman, and she pulled it off like a pro,” gushes Surpreet. 

 Guess what, all the family members are loving it, and her mother-in-law, especially, is so impressed, she can’t stop sharing the video of her daughter-in-law, redefining swag.
