PANAJI: Rejecting the assurances given by town and country planning minister Vijai  , villagers of St Andre and St Cruz constituencies on Wednesday demanded that the state government denotify the entire  .

 The villagers, under the banner of Goenkars Against PDA (GAP), have decided to hold a protest march to Azad Maidan on April 6, said activist Arturo D’Souza.
 
 Though the villagers had initially expressed concerns about 10 villages being included in the   PDA and had called for a review, the villagers have now demanded that Sardesai must disband the Greater Panaji PDA.
 
 Calling the   department’s role “evasive and non-committal”, the villagers claimed that despite sufficient time being given, Sardesai had failed to de-notify the Greater Panaji PDA.
 
 The villagers of Siridao, Azossim-Mandur and Gancim-Batim will also participate in the protest despite Sardesai recommending that Azossim-Mandur and Gancim-Batim be removed from the Greater Panaji PDA. Siridao is not part of this planning authority.
 
 “We will gather at 3pm at Patto plaza and peacefully walk to Azad Maidan,” D’Souza said.
