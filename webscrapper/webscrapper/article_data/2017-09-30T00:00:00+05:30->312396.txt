With terms like gender fluidity, gender bending, and androgyny becoming fashion buzzwords, designers are sending men out in skirts, questioning the conventional norms

 The September 2017 issue of Grazia listed out the 100 most influential people in fashion today. It featured stylist Nitasha Gaurav, among others. Now, if you have scratched or shook your head at any of Ranveer Singh’s fashion outings, chances are Gaurav was behind it, she is after all the stylist for Bollywood’s most sartorially adventurous leading man. Singh, on his part, has played along. He has donned a lehenga, worn kajal and recently, wore a Rajesh Pratap Singh designed manskirt for a men’s magazine event. The end result: Some ridicule him (he’s a veritable meme mine), while some admire him. Gaurav said: “I find gender lines a bit ridiculous, especially when it comes to personal style. I have tried to blur those a little with Ranveer’s style, and I love how we are moving into a more accepting and open space.” 
 But the question is, are we? Designer Kunal Anil Tanna says, “Much ink has been spilled on Ranveer Singh’s quirky sartorial choices. The actor does push the envelope when it comes to gender-bending fashion. While this trend still has to find many takers, today’s metrosexual men are open to experimenting with the man-skirt, which has been trying to go mainstream since the 1960s.”
 
 
 
 Designers – Indian and international — have been working towards blurring the gender lines. Rohit Bal did it first by making male models walk down the ramp with sindoor and wearing flowing kurtas. Thom Browne showcased skirt suits in his latest Spring-Summer Homme collection. Rajesh Pratap Singh has put out different iterations of manskirts. To say that the manskirt if having a fashion moment won’t be wrong. Hollywood celebrities like Jared Leto, Kanye West, Jaden Smith and Vin Diesel too have shown their support for the skirt. 
 In the UK a group of boy students stepped out in skirts to counter the heatwave. Men’s clothing commonly includes skirts and skirt-like garments – like the Vietnamese sarong, the Bhutanese gho, the Scottish kilt, Ladakhi goncha or the Indian lungi. But celebrity stylist and fashion writer Rishi Raj would not consider traditional garments helping break the gender barriers. He says, “Classicism, elitism and communal overtones stain the lungi or dhoti. A manskirt, on the other hand, spins the whole thing into a fashionable, au-courant debate on gender/sexuality definitions. So it’ll definitely grab headlines till the next big thing comes along,” he adds. 
  
 In India, there may be some men stepping out in skirts or saris, but men who wear skirts are still on the fringes of fashion. Raj is sure that the change will not come in his lifetime. Tanna says, “When men on the street show evidence of going beyond acceptable fashion boundaries, they become suspect somehow. These fashion choices can even call a man’s work ethic into question.” Experimentation in style, especially for Indian men, is still restricted to socks (or the lack of them), elbow patches and the cut of his suit. However, every time a man raises the hemlines, it may raise hackles but it also breaks barriers – one swish at a time.
