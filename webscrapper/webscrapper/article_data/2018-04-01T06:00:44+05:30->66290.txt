CHENNAI: Probing a case of suspected sales tax evasion by traders, the state may have stumbled upon possible cases of money laundering worth crores of rupees in the city.

 Additional advocate-general Narmadha Sampath told the Madras HC that a criminal case filed against a group of traders has been pending with the central crime branch police since 2005, and officials are trying to extend the probe’s scope to check whether traders laundered money to the extent of Rs 2,739 crore through dubious ‘bill trading’ under the erstwhile TN General Sales Tax Act. The court was hearing a plea moved by Rukma Industries Ltd (now Surana Corporation Ltd) challenging notices issued by the   in 2014 demanding Rs 92.37 lakh in sales tax.
 
 The traders allegedly raised dummy invoices for buying and selling, for a consideration, without actually carrying out any physical transaction. Such transactions could not be tracked under the old Sales Tax Act. Submitting assessment records of  ,   (both closed since 2003) registered as iron and steel dealers in 2001, Sampath said, “The records shows that Bhawarlal Sharma had registered the firms with different registering authorities in different assessment circles, and both companies were in business for the same period.”
 
 During 2002-03, B B Forgings reported a turnover of Rs 13.59 crore, but stated its taxable component as nil since it claimed all its trade as second sales. Files show considerable trade of both firms was with Rukma Industries. 
 
 While Rukma Industries showed all its trading with the two firms and claimed second-sale tax exemption, the firms in turn recorded all their transactions as second sales with Rukma and claimed exemption, the additional advocate-general said.
