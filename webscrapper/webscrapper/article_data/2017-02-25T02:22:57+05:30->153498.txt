 Advocate Diwakar Singh, counsel for Smith, said that he had picked up the laptop by mistake as it was similar to the one he owned and was carrying with him. 
 
 The advocate contended that Smith had already returned the lapotop to the complainant. He urged the court to cancel the look out notice issued by Sahar police and allow Smith to go to the UK to attend his daughter’s wedding.
