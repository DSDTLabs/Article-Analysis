MUMBAI: The   arrested for allegedly sending a lewd and threatening text message to a female MLC from NCP, had sent similar messages to at least 12 politicians, including Shiv Sena MLA  , between February 21 and 27. Police learnt this after retrieving the mobile phone call data records of the accused, Deepak kumar Gupta (40). 

 On Wednesday, Pune crime branch officials met   to get details about Gupta; they will seek his custody for a similar offence lodged at Shivaji Nagar police by Gorhe. Police are, however, yet to verify why he had sent such messages to eight female and four male politicians. 
 
 The   told TOI: “I received the message on February 21 at midnight and read it the next day at 10am. He also threatened to shoot me if I lodged a police complaint.” She informed DCP (zone VIII) Virendra Mishra on February 22. “He told me to lodge a complaint with the Vile Parle police,” she added.
 
 A Vile Parle police team tracked down Gupta at Jalgaon, where is employed as a salesman at a relative’s cloth shop. He denied sending the messages and claimed he is being framed because he had filed a writ petition against MLA Anil Gote in 2015. 
 
 Gupta has been booked under IPC sections 507 (criminal intimidation by by anonymous communication), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and IT Act Section 67 (A) (publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act). While three of the female victims’ have lodged complaints—NCP MLC from Vile Parle, an MLA from Navi Mumbai and Gorhe—another neta is expected to approach the MHB Colony police soon.
