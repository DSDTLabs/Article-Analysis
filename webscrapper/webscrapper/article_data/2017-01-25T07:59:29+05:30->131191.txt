PUNE: Digital mode of payments may have made considerable inroads after the  , but cash is still the king.

 As cash supply improves, increased number of people are opting for cash payments across the city now. Icing on the cake is better availability of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes, which takes care of the ‘change’ problem.
 
 The cash transactions are more convenient for me, Ajit Tayade, a kirana store owner, said. “With the improved supply of cash and smaller currency notes, there is hardly any problem now. For a sizable billing amount, even if the customer gives me Rs 2,000 note, I don’t mind giving him the change. I use the higher-denomination notes to pay my suppliers,” he said.
 
 The   for us was only till new Rs 500 notes came into circulation, Poonam Gole, who manages a chemist shop, said. “Also, the days of ‘no change’ are past us,” she added.
 
 As more people returned to the cash payments, autorickshaw drivers too heaved a sigh of relief. “The days of crunch are almost over. Most of my customers are now paying by cash,” autorickshaw driver Dyaneshwar Pawale said.
 
 The increased cash transactions does not necessarily mean the end of the road for digital payments. Manager of a city-based restaurant said, “The cash and card payments are almost going hand-in-hand now.” 
 
 For many, cash transactions are all about the feel of it. “Though I rely on paying by card, I use currency notes occasionally just to get the feel of it,” Madhuri Bhalla, a teacher, said.
