KOLKATA: The State Election Commission has convened an all-party meeting on Monday to decide on the poll dates even as the opposition parties put the heat on the commission all through Sunday.

 The four-hour window for filing nominations opens at 11am on Monday. On Sunday, allegations of threats and intimidation were made, but only one formal police complaint was lodged in  .
 
 “The SEC has convened a meeting again on Monday. Earlier, the poll dates were announced even before it was discussed with the stakeholders,” said BJP leader Pratap Banerjee. BJP leaders   and Jayprakash Mazumdar on Sunday met the SEC officials and urged them to issue guidelines and clarifications so the all the SDO and BDO offices accept Form A and Form B as required by rules. “The four-hour window given to candidates to file nomination is grossly inadequate. Around 27% gram panchayats are virtually uncontested as opposition candidates were not able to file nominations,” said Bhattacharya.
 
 The opposition parties on Sunday demanded that gram panchayat candidates should be allowed to file nominations at SDO offices as well. “There is every likelihood that supporters of   will try to intimidate candidates. They will also try to thwart the process of nomination filing,” said PCC president  .
 
 According to CPM leader Rabin Deb, there is not enough security arrangement at BDO offices. “The SEC has not done anything to instil confidence among the candidates to ensure that the nomination process is free of intimidation. Opposition candidates were threatened even on Sunday in Dakshin Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri and Murshidabad. The present situation defeats the spirit of the apex court order that asked the SEC to take appropriate steps to remove apprehensions and ensure free and fair election,” he said.
 
 Trinamool dismissed these claims, saying that the opposition was trying to hide its inability to field candidates.
