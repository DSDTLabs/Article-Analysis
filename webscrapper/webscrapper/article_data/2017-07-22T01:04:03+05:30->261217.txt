Coimbatore: The two-year-old biomethanation plant set up by the city corporation at Nanjundapuram crematorium at a cost of Rs48 lakh has not generated biogas for the last six months.

 “Since the day of its inauguration, only 20 bodies were cremated using methane gas generated from the plant,” said an employee at the plant. The balloon set up is faulty and many pipelines connected to the plant have developed leaks, he said. 
 
 While the corporation claims to be generating biogas from the facility, the reality is different. The plant is designed to digest 1.5 tonnes of biowaste from 20 wards located close to it and generate 25kg of biogas a day. KCP Private Limited had taken up the work of operating the plant. However, the facility generated biogas only for six months. 
 
 “Since January, pipes are leaking and the balloon has not inflated at all,” said one of the employees.
 
 However, corporation officials in charge for the facility claim the plant is being run at its full capacity. Yet, when asked about the generation of biogas, an engineer said he did not have the data. “Waste is being processed. That is more important. Whether biogas is being generated or not is a different issue,” said the corporation engineer in-charge of the plant.
 
 When TOI visited the plant, only two workers were working at the site. They said that there were some repair works that had to be undertaken to generate biogas. The manager of the plant refused to answer our calls.
