NEW DELHI: The south corporation has started pre-monsoon measures to deal with issues like water logging points, desilting of drains and survey for identification of dangerous buildings. 

 The commissioner of the civic body chaired a meeting of senior officials from engineering and DEMS (sanitation) department to streamline the working. Engineer-in-chief for the corporation, Umesh Sachdeva, said: “Delhi traffic police frequently brings out list for the major waterlogging points across the city. Much to our credit, there is not a single such point in the current list currently in south corporations jurisdiction.”
 
 However, every year the complaints of water logging during monsoons are invariable. Civic officials assure that a visible change will be seen this year. “This year the desilitng has been preponed so that it finishes before the onset of  ,” Sachdeva added. 
 
 An annual door to door survey is conducted every year during April-May to identify the dangerous structures which might not be able to bear the torrential rains. Officials said that the survey started from April 15 this year. It is expected to be finished by June 15, the civic body hopes to finish the work before the deadline. “The pumps and pumping stations are being repaired in order to keep them operational and handle additional load” he added.
