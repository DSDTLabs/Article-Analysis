Vadodara: Kamatibaug – the gift by the visionary   to the city – will soon have more attractions not only for children but even much older persons. The garden is set to have an aviary and a toy bullet train plying on tracks there apart form an urban forest.

 In the budget proposed by the   ( ) administration, the civic body has proposed to develop an aviary near the existing zoo. The civic body has already advertised tenders for the aviary. It has estimated that the facility will cost the civic body around Rs 12.5crore.
 
 VMC officials said that the aviary may be the largest in the country. Those visiting it will be able to walk through it and see several varieties of birds inside it.
 
 Another proposal that the administrative wing has proposed is that of having an air-conditioned toy train in the garden that will be a replica of the bullet train. The project will come up on a public-private partnership mode with the VMC providing only space in the garden for the project.
 
 The   bullet train will pass through the city and is being seen as a game changer in many ways including development of the railway station area. The toy train modelled after it will in a way celebrate the real bullet train.
 
 The third major addition will be an urban forest that will come up in the garden along the Vishwamitri river bank. The civil work for the project has already begun and the civic body will be spending Rs 2.35crore on this.
 
 The urban forest project is also a part of the major afforestation drive that the VMC has taken up in the city. In the past various options like a laser show to other types of gardens have been discussed, but the civic body has eventually settled for the present form.
