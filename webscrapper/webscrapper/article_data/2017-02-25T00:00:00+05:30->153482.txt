We had already told you that director Sugeeth is all set for another movie with   and Vinayakan. Now the team has roped in Darvinte Parinamam fame   to play the female lead in the movie.

  The director of the yet-to-be-titled movie tells us, “Chandini plays a bold and smart girl from Kochi. She is a casting agent for junior artistes and very good at her work. Energetic and enthusiastic, she is a go-getter.”
 
  Chandini is gung-ho about bagging a movie by the director who has made hits like Ordinary and Madhura Naranga. “I am glad to play Chackochan’s love interest. I will be seen as a simple Kochikkari in the film,” she says.
 
  Kunchacko Boban will be seen as an Idukki guy who comes to Kochi to settle down. Vinayakan too plays an equally important role in the movie. Sugeeth says, “I have tried to bring out a different side of these two actors. There will be a lot of humour and some action sequences in the film. It also talks about a social issue.”
  A close associate of the film, Ashiq Usman tells us that the team is planning to release the movie during Eid. “The film will go on floors on March 27 and will be shot in Idukki and Ernakulam. The film also has Salim Kumar, Kanaran Hareesh and Dharmajan Bolgatty playing pivotal roles,” he sums up.
