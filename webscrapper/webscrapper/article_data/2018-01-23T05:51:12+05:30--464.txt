GANDHINAGAR: Paresh  , the 42-year-old   leader and   from Amreli, took over as leader of opposition (LOP) on Monday, amid a huge gathering of his supporters. Senior   Congress leaders including state unit president Bharatsinh Solanki and most of the Congress MLAs were present at the ceremony.

 Dhanani first did a puja in the LOP office, before signing papers to officially take charge. After taking over, Dhanani told mediapersons, “Congress wants to end the rule of fear, hunger and corruption in Gujarat, as it ousted the British from India during the Independence struggle. We will raise the people’s issues within and outside the assembly, to force the BJP government to actually work for welfare of the people instead of making tall promises. The coming assembly session will be our priority, to raise the issues of farmers, students, women and all kinds of people, who are facing apathy from the BJP government.”
 
 Dhanani also held a meeting with Congress MLAs where they discussed various issues and the strategy for the coming budget session. The Congress MLAs will be sworn in on January 23 at Swarnim Sankul.
