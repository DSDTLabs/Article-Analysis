Margao: South Goa Tourist Taxi Association has assured the government of its cooperation in the installation of fare meters for their vehicles, provided the state protect the interests of Goan taxi operators.  “We have never disagreed with the government over the installation of meters. We have categorically told the chief minister, in the course of our meetings with him, that the official rates as notified in the official gazette, be displayed outside hotels, so as to avoid any conflicts. Every now and then taxi operators are accused of overcharging without any reason,” taxi operators told reporters on Tuesday.  On the issue of mobile app-based taxi service, the taxi operators association said that any move to bring in such services to Goa would be the end for self-employed Goan taxi operators. “We are required to submit our character certificate and residence certificate while applying for a professional driving licence. Mobile app-based taxi service will allow non-Goans to take over the taxi service, which is the only business left for Goans in Goa. The government should protect the interests of Goan taxi operators,” they said. Taxi operators demanded that authorities take immediate action against private vehicles operating as taxis or those who rent out self-driven vehicles without any permission from the RTO. However, they are opposed to the installation of speed governors to their vehicles, saying that “they serve no purpose”. “As per police records, only one per cent of accidents are caused by tourist vehicles; most are caused by private ones. If anything, speed governors will only hamper smooth movement of vehicles, and cause delay to our guests in reaching their destinations like the airport,” the taxi operators said.
