English is up for grabs at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Dyal Singh, Maharaja Agrasen, Ramanujan and Sri Aurobindo colleges. The cutoff for political science, however, still hovers around 90%, though a few colleges have brought their percentages down to 84%.

Aditi Mahavidyalaya, Daulat Ram, Dyal Singh (Evening), Janki Devi Memorial, Maharaja Agrasen, PGDAV, Ramanujan, Sri Aurobindo and Zakir Hussain (Evening) colleges have the course open, with the cutoff ranging from 87% to 95%. 
 
 In science, almost all colleges have closed admissions to physics, chemistry and maths, with the exception of DDU, Janki Devi Memorial and Ramanujan among others.
