MANGALURU: A few days ago, PM   campaigned in   City South assembly constituency, a hotbed of economic activities in the district. However, Mangaluru’s very own Modi, who is an ardent follower of the PM, has been campaigning for an independent candidate.

 
 K Vasantha Prabhu, 72, a hardcore RSS man who resembles the PM, has been campaigning for Srikar Prabhu, once a BJP leader, to “give him justice”. Srikar was expelled from BJP on charges of anti-party activities in 2014.
 
 “He (Srikar) shot six letters to the party seeking a reason for his expulsion. However, they did not reply to a single letter. All he had asked the BJP was a chance to be a karyakarta,” said Vasantha.
