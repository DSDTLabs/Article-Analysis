LUCKNOW: After the city fared poorly in the   survey with only 43%, CM Yogi Aditya Nath took to sweeping the drains and streets of Balu Adda area on Saturday. In what seems to be a wakeup call for  's sanitary staff, Yogi instructed the mayor to meet corporators individually and show him results in 15 days. 

 Disappointed at LMC's lackadaisical attitude towards the stinking heaps of garbage and overflowing sewage, Yogi reached Balu Adda and swept the streets and drains along with UP's urban development minister Suresh Khanna, Mayor Suresh Awasthi and LMC officials. Yogi also ordered the chalking out of cleanliness rosters for each ward.
 
  He asked the mayor to sensitise locals and corporators against disposing garbage on streets. "All drains in Lucknow should be de-silted properly before monsoon so that there is no waterlogging and sludge overflowing on roads or back into drains," he instructed LMC. 
 
 With the cleaning of Balu Adda, Yogi flagged off 'Special Cleaning Drive' in Lucknow under which mayor and LMC officials would randomly inspect three-four assembly constituencies of the city on every first Saturday of the month and would clean the roads and drains in these places. 
 
 He said though urban development minister is planning to step up cleaning work in UP, the mayor should focus on cleanliness on an emergency scale.
