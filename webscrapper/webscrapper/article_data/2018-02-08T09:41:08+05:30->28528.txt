BENGALURU: Home minister   admitted in the legislative council on Wednesday that no headway in the investigation of the murder of slain rationalist and scholar M M Kalburgi. The comments come in the wake of the scholar's wife, Umadevi, approaching the   over the lax attitude in apprehending the killers. 

  Replying to a debate on the law and order situation in the state, Reddy said: "I admit that there has been no progress in the investigation of Kalburgi's murder. There are various factors due to which we have been unable to make any headway in the case." 
 
 When KB Shanappa (BJP) demanded why the government cannot hand over the case to the   (CBI), Reddy shot back: "What is the use? The CBI has been unable to crack the Narendra Dabholkar case either. As for the   murder case, there has been no breakthrough by the Maharashtra police." Reddy agreed to the views of legislators that the Kalburgi case is taking a long time to solve.
 
 Based on Umadevi's petition, the apex court had issued notice to the Centre over the claims that the murders of Dabholkar, Pansare and Kalburgi were similar. 
 
 Meanwhile, on the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, Reddy was optimistic of resolving the case.
 
 "We have clues and are making heading into the last stretch of the case," he said. "I am 100 per cent sure the case will be solved. We are only trying to build a strong case around the culprits so that they are not let off due to lacunae in our investigation."
 
 The home minister cited the example of   activist Virendra Tawade who was arrested by the CBI in the Dabholkar murder case, but was freed due to the evidence being insufficient and the case falling apart.
 
 "We do not want to be in the same position as the CBI which had arrested Tawade and released him for failing to prove the case," said Reddy. Gauri Lankesh was shot dead in front of her home on September 5, 2017.
