LUCKNOW: With just 10 days left for Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s vice-chancellor Prof RC Sobti’s five-year term to end, a search-cum-selection committee for appointment of new vice-chancellor is yet to be finalised.   (BoM) will decide on the search-cum-selection committee on Friday.

 University had in November nominated two members, former Chief Justice of India, KG   and eminent scientist Prof HS Gupta to select new VC. But Justice Balakrishnan declined citing other engagements. The BoM will decide a nominee to replace Justice Balakrishnan on Friday. Prof Sobti’s term is ending on January 21.   had issued an advertisement for appointment of VC in October end, four months after the Union ministry of human resource development’s directions to advertise the post and send names of two nominees for the selection committee.
 
 In addition, BoM is also likely to discuss the issue of revocation of suspension of Prof Vipin Saxena, who was caught red-handed accepting bribe by CBI.
