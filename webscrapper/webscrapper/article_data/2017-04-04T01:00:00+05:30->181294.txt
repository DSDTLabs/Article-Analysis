Looks like   has been on a winning spree. It was only last month when she won the bronze medal at the State Level Powerlifting Competition for Benchpress. Now, the radio jockey and anchor has won gold at the   for Deadlift. An excited   says, “This event happened on Sunday. The powerlifting championship has three categories — back squat, benchpress and deadlift. I won the silver for back squat, gold for bench press and even attended the State Level Championship for the same. And now, I am happy that I won gold for deadlift at the District Level event. But this was no easy task as the competition was tough. Each person is given three trails. I started with 70kg, progressed to 75kg and attempted my last call at 80kg.”

 Ramya is elated about her win. “It feels great. I saw many people cheering for me. I convert all my negative energy into a positive one when I focus on this. I channelise my energy when I do powerlifting. I am happy that many women nowadays are taking this up. We are not just strong people mentally, but physically, too. I plan to take a fitness certification by this year. I want to start my own academy someday,” she signs off.
