HYDERABAD: Using only the concepts of physics he learnt in school and a few basic coding skills, a 17-year-old city-based high school graduate   has designed ' ' - a product for women, which when used allows them to   of crimes.

 An aspiring tech entrepreneur, Mandala says that using such a product will help a woman thwart even a rape attempt. The 'shoe' inflicts 0.1amp electricity and also sends out an alert for assistance to cops and family members. Explaining the concept behind the 'ElectroShoe', Mandala says, “The shoe was created using a unique circuit board that uses footsteps to charge itself with the help of a concept called the “piezoelectric effect“. The more the user walks, the more energy is generated and stored in a  ."
 
 While he has already applied for a patent, Mandala is now looking to test the viability of his product in the real market.
 
 “After the patent is obtained, I plan to approach start-up incubators in the city to get a better understanding of how my product will fare in the real market and what changes I have to make to the prototype. I need to focus on the designing of the product in order to make it appealing in a market space," said Mandala, adding that he was inspired to create the self defence device for women, post the 2012 Delhi gangrape incident. “All a woman needs to do is ensure that the battery is sufficiently charged. When the shoe makes contact with an attacker's body , the attacker will be electrocuted,“"he said.
 
 If Telangana's record of crimes against women is anything to go by , Mandala's invention could not have come at a better time. Telangana (83.1) stood third in the country in the rate of crime against women in 2015. As per the National Crime Records Bureau data, Delhi reported the highest crime rate (184.3) in 2015, as against overall national rate of 56.3. Delhi was followed by Assam (148.2), Odisha (81.9), Rajasthan (81.5), Haryana (75.7) and   (73.4).
