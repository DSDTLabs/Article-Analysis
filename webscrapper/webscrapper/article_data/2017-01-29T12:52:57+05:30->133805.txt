PATNA: It’s a household practice, especially among women, to keep currency in cupboards, suitcases and books. But the habit has caused substantial loss to many due to the   of old Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes on November 8 last year.
 
  People from across the state are still reaching the   ( ) office near   in Patna with old Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes, which are useless as banks stopped exchanging them on December 31 last year.
  
  One Dev Muni Ram (66), a retired railway employee, reached the RBI Patna on Friday with Rs7,500 in old Rs500 notes. But the old woman was disheartened to know that her notes won’t be exchanged any more. When asked, a visibly annoyed Ram said it all happened due to his wife. “What to do. These women have the habit of storing notes in boxes and suitcases which are not even touched for several years,” he said, adding that the bundle of notes surfaced while taking out old clothes from a suitcase which was untouched for several years. He immediately rushed to Patna from his Narayanpur village in Rohtas district with hopes to get his scrapped currency exchanged.
  
  Sheikh Haidar Ali (29), an engineer in Bangalore, reached Kuchaikot in Gopalganj on leave, but rushed to Patna soon after he found one Rs1,000 and four Rs500 old notes which his mother had kept and forgotten. “My mother is not much educated. But after reaching Patna, I came to know from the RBI officials that the notes would not be exchanged any more,” Ali said, adding that he might keep these notes as souvenir.
  
  Sangam Kumar, a student from   in Nalanda, also reached the RBI office here with Rs3000 in old notes after his mother Sudha Devi suddenly discovered the currency at home.
  
  Even some youths were also facing the same problem with old notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 kept in books which they forgot. “I found one Rs500 old note in my book which I tried to get exchanged, but failed,” said Tarun Jha of village Lagma in Darbhanga, who is preparing for competitive exams in Patna.
