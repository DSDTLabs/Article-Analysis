  : Upset at not getting money from his parents for buying a  , an 11-year-old boy, Mujammil Ansari, committed suicide in Ashoka Garden on Friday. 

 The Class 8 student's kin rushed him to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. 
 
 Neighbours told police that the boy was known to be stubborn.
 
 Investigation officer ASI Kamal Singh said Mujammil's father,  , runs a pan shop in the same locality. The boy and his elder brother used to live with their uncle in   and came to Bhopal to visit their father for   a few days back, Singh said. 
 
 Mukim has told police that his little boy was demanding money to buy a smartphone but his mother was dead against it. She thought a smartphone would spoil him. 
 
 The family was also going through a financial crisis yet Mukim managed to spare Rs 1,500 and gave it to Mujammil to buy new clothes. On Friday morning, Mujammil got up early and offered namaz. He then went out to play. On returning home, he went upstairs, telling his mother that he was going to sleep. 
 
 Around 6.30pm when his mother went upstairs, she found Mujammil hanging from the ceiling fan. She immediately called her husband. They took him to hospital, but he was dead.
 
 Police did not find any suicide note in the room but believe Mujammil committed suicide because he was denied a smartphone.
