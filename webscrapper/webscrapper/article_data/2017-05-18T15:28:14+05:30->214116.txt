 Bnaya Ganesh is notorious in the forest area. To curb his criminal proclivity, the   is using a female kumki elephant named Urvashi. But female elephants are afraid of Bnaya Ganesh and so far, such preventive and containment measures have failed. 
 
 The Forest Department is at a loss. They say Bnaya Ganesh is a 'serial killer', who has struck down eight people. On Wednesday, he killed 80-year-old Jaynarayan Sharma in  .
 
 Jaldapara forest officials have sought a report on Bnaya Ganesh's behaviour and activities, while the locals are baying for the murdering elephant's blood.
 
 This has led forest officials to consider awarding the death penalty to Bnaya Ganesh. West Bengal Forest Department's wildlife head Ravikant Sinha said, "There is a provision in law, that if an elephant is a killer and destroyer, he could be given death penalty based on his or her behavior and killing nature."
 
 Elephant expert Parbaty Barua tried to explain the elephant's behavior thus: "Elephants are mainly unionized by nature. Bnaya Ganesh is out of his herd. So this could be the reason behind his criminal activities."
