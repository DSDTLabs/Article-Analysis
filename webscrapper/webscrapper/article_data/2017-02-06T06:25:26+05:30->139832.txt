AMRITSAR: Many Sikhs in Nankana Sahib, birth place of Guru  , led by   (PSGPC) general secretary Gopal Singh Chawla held an anti-India demonstration on Sunday. Every year on February 5, Kashmir   is observed by Pakistan government and militant organizations spearheading a militant movement in the Valley.

 Chawla, during the protest, which was attended by members of several Islamist militant groups, spewed venom against India and sang hosannas in favour of militants carrying out disruptive activities in Jammu and Kashmir. Intelligence sources told TOI on Sunday that Chawla, who is known to have close relations with terror mastermind Hafiz Saeed, currently under house arrest, also addressed a gathering, assuring Pak Sikhs’ support to militants operating in J and K. 
 
 According to a video clip in possession with the TOI, Chawla praised Saeed and termed him his ‘Jarnail’, who was fighting for the people of Kashmir.
 
 Intelligence sources, who are keeping a watch on the movement of Chawla, said that he was involved in anti-India movement and had close links with Mumbai terror blast Saeed. They further said that they apprehend that he could initiate recruitment of Sikh youths from both India and Pakistan for Saeed’s Jammat-ud-Dawa, which wass now been rebranded as Tehreek Azadi Jammu and Kashmir for militant operations in the Valley.
 
 The sources further said that Pakistan’s ISI had been looking for soft targets among Sikhs during their pilgrimage to Pakistan on various religious occasions. “We have already warned about the activities of Chawla, who is using a religious platform to implement Saeed’s anti-India plans,” said sources, adding that they apprehend Chawla’s attempt to lure gullible Sikhs during te upcoming Sikh pilgrims’ visit to Pakistan on Baisakhi.
