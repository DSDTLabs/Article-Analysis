 Traffic PI, circle II, M R Nakum was driving his car through BRTS lane in Jahangirpura area when this conscientious resident stopped his vehicle ahead of the police official’s and forced him to stop.

 “The video is of Tuesday and I was getting late for a meeting when this incident happened. The video was shot at a crossroad and not in BRTS lane.
