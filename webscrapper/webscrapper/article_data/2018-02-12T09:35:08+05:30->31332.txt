BAMBOLIN: India could become a $5 trillion economy by 2022 if the government ensured food, clothing, homes and internet connectivity was adequate, said   group chairman   on Saturday. 

 "The Indian economy is growing at a rate of 7%, and the world is envying us," he said. "We are presently a $2.5 trillion economy, and I am very bullish that India will become a $5 trillion economy very soon." 
 
 He was speaking at the concluding ceremony of the Goa BizFest 2018 at the SP   stadium in Bambolim.

 "If these four critical components fall into place, India will become a very powerful global economy," Dempo said.
 
 Dempo also emphasized the need for Indian businesses to focus on reaching out to the masses. Dempo said: "It is important for Indian businesses, both small and big, to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor."
