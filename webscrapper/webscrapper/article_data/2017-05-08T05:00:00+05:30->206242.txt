The   celebrations in the city culminated with a midnight revelry that lit up the Charminar on Saturday night. The Old City resonated with sounds of vrooming bikes and echoes of naach gana as 150 female bikers from across the country joined in the celebrations. 
Organised by Bikerni’s, an all-female biker’s group, the ride was flagged-off by  , Addl Commissioner of Police, (Crimes) at 11 pm from People’s Plaza, Necklace Road. When these bikernis reached Charminar, they had a little surprise in store for them — a huge poster that read, ‘Welcome Bikernis to Charminar’ put up by the male bikers of the city. “We want to spread the message that women need to step out of their homes and own the roads with the ‘I Pledge’ campaign. So it was great to get such overwhelming support from the male bikers in the city,” said  , one of the organisers. 
  Before parting their ways with cheers and warm hugs, the ladies broke into songs and danced on the streets. “It’s totally like a family get-together. It was a great platform to share stories of our journeys and egg each other on,” said an excited Smriti. 
 Earlier in the day a number of female riders were felicitated on the occasion by travel blogger Anuradha Goel and Mamta Raghuvir, head of Tarunni and US Consulate Public Relations Chief Gabriel Hons-Olivier among other dignitaries. The event held at   also featured a Mohiniyattam performance, Navarasanjali by   and her disciple,  .
  “It was a wonderful experience for me to travel to Chrminar in a bike. All along the way, we were accompanied by male bikers and SHE-teams of the Telangana police, who helped to make the event quite peaceful,” said  , a 55-year-old record holding biker.
  “Biking has no age or gender and it is a liberating experience for women. It is heartening to see women come out to prove that they can also ride safely and without fear on Indian roads,” said   from Qatar, the lone-international rider of the event.
