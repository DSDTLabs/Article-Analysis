Vadodara: Police vigil and patrolling has been intensified in Ranu village near Padra where rioting broke out between groups of two communities on Saturday night. 

 A man and his mother were injured when they were attacked by a group of people after a class X student from the minority community was allegedly threatened over some petty issue. 
 
 Superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural),   and deputy superintendent of police K D Parmar visited the village late night on Saturday and held peace meetings with people of both communities. On Sunday too, the regional officer from the district administration took stock of the situation.
 
 A police official said that four persons identified as Sohil Rathod, Sahil Rathod, Iqbal Pathan and Mohsin Malek, all residents of Ranu barged into house of  , a staffer of a pharma company, on Saturday afternoon.
 
 They asked Patel about his friend Kishan Patel and attacked Patel and his mother Usha with a knife and wooden sticks. Cops said that Kishan had threatened Aadil Rafique, a class X student over a petty issue. “We suspect that since Kishan had threatened Rafique few days back, Patel and his mother were attacked,” said the police official.
 
 Later some persons from Patel’s neighbourhood also tried to attack Sohil and others of his neighbourhood but, Padra police reached the village and controlled the situation before things aggravated. 
 
 A source in the police department said that they have identified few persons apart from Sohil, Sahil, Pathan and Malek for the melee and the arrests will be made soon.
 
 Tension has been simmering since a long time between the groups over minor incidents of bike racing, eve teasing and creating nuisance in the village by young men of two different communities. 
 
 Patel and his mother are recovering in a local government hospital.
