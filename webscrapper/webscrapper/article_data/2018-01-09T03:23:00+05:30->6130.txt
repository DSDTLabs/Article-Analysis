Visakhapatnam: Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan was highly impressed by the immaculate cleanliness of the city railway station, which he went on to laud in a tweet that went viral.

 “Truly impressed by the high standard of cleanliness and hygiene maintained at Visakhapatnam railway station. Could sense the clear reflection of the Prime Minister's Swachh Bharat Mission at this station and Swachch Rail station as well. Appreciate the efforts of everyone involved,” Pradhan tweeted.
 
 His tweet received nearly 80 comments and 2,000 likes including one from Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and 380 retweets by the time of filing this report.
 
 The minister, who visited the city on Sunday to take part in the activities of Visakha Refinery of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), inaugurated a school at Gudilova that was developed with the corporate social responsibility funds of the HPCL for Rs 2.7 crore. He also took part in the skill development centre activites.
 
 Pradhan chose to travel back to Bhubaneswar by train. He went to the city station at 9.30 pm on Sunday and waited for nearly two hours at the station due to the delay in the arrival of the Coromandel Express. In the meantime, he decided to inspect the stalls and general cleanliness of the station along with the officials and party cadre at around 11pm on Sunday night.
