NEW DELHI: India’s premier military and research development outfit,   ( ), was roasted on   on Friday after it sent out a tweet seeking help for a sign-in problem for its verified Facebook page.

 “We are contacting u from Indian @DRDO_India our official page is not opening. the url for the same is facebook.com/DPIDRDO/ plz revert asap as this is official page (sign in problem),” the post said. Usually, when one is unable to sign into a web service, there is an option to reset the password. 
 
 Across web services like Facebook,  , Twitter, and others, there is a standard “forgot password” option for such situations. On clicking this, one receives an email with a link to reset password. The whole process, from resetting to logging back in, takes just a few clicks. 
 
  seized the opportunity to mock DRDO. “Have you tried turning your computer off and on again (sic)” asked a sarcastic @1astknight. @SachynK asked, “what next (sic)? Tweeting (sic) Bill Gates if you forget your Windows password?”; “instead of playing candy crush saga on facebook, concentrate on india’s defence. At least think abt our solders at the border,” tweeted @kiduva.
 
 DRDO’s tweet was deleted around three hours later. “It was just an operational issue and it is sorted now. There was no hacking,” a DRDO spokesperson told TOI over phone.
 
 Though the original tweet was deleted, @DRDO_India tweeted back at the above tweets later in the day saying, “Thx for ur advice. we r back in action (sic).”
