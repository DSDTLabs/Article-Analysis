 For Sidhartha, it is the screenplay that is the king in this movie, and is what made him sign on the dotted line. “I have completed 18 films so far, and none of them have had a screenplay like Shuddhi. Usually, the director runs you through the story of the film and your character, but Adarsh’s (H Eshwarappa, director) screenplay was extremely detailed — with everything from the sound and colours of each shot. You could feel the energy of the film in the script itself, and while reading it, it was evident how it would translate into a film. That sealed the deal for me. The screenplay is this film’s strength,” the actor says.
