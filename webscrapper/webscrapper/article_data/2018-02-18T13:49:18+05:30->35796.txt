Actor   said, "love is complicated". 

 The 31-year-old actor had recently split with   FKA Twigs, to whom he was engaged since April 2015. 
 
  
  
 Pattinson, who was recently asked about his character Samuel in the film 'Damsel' at a press conference in Berlin, described the part as someone who lives in a romantic bubble. 
 
 The Independent quoted the actor said, "It's obviously more complicated. I think Samuel, the main character, is a bit of a fantasist. He likes believing in a poetic version of reality. 
 "I think life and love is a little more complicated than he perceives it."
