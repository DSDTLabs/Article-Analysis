MUMBAI: It is the obligation of the state to ensure free and fair elections and use of VVPAT apparatus will be a step toward transparency in the election process, the Bombay high court said recently. 

 The court was hearing a petition challenging the election of   MLA Madhuri Misal to the state legislative assembly from the Parvati constituency in Pune by defeated   candidate  .
 
 Justice   dismissed Chhajed's election petition, but agreed that the use of Voters Variable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) would benefit the election process. "Elections are a vital and integral part of any democracy. For this, a free and fair election process is essentially a lifeline. Therefore, it is the obligation of the state, especially the welfare state, to assure a transparent and non-corrupt system and the use of VVPAT apparatus will be a step towards ensuring this," said Justice Bhatkar.
 
 Chhajed had claimed VVPAT machines were not used for the assembly elections in 2014. "Admittedly, there is no use of VVPAT though the rules are amended. However, as observed by the Supreme Court, the Election Commission of India has assured there will be phase-wise use of VVPAT in view of the financial burden and technical availability. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said there is non-compliance with the rules or orders by the returning officer or by the ECI," said the judge. 
 
 The court took on record the election commission's assurance that VVPAT system would be used for the next assembly and Parliamentary elections. The judge held there was no evidence about any irregularities. "There is a difference of 73,611 votes between that of the returned candidate and the elected candidate. The evidence is not sufficient to hold that because of non-compliance with rules or because of the use of EVMs or due to change in the name and signature of polling agent, Chhajed's case was materially affected to declare the election void," ruled the court.
