Mumbai: The Tata Sons counsel   on Wednesday submitted before the   ( ) that the board had lost confidence in   as their chairperson and was hence removed.

 Making his arguments at a hearing on a complaint of mismanagement and oppression against the   holding company, filed by two Mistry family firms who are its minority shareholders, Singhvi said that there was nothing “personal” about the removal. It was “purely a commercial decision”.
 
 Mistry’s case was that his removal was not even originally on the day’s agenda. But Singhvi pointed out that the   allows for addition to a day’s agenda following the permission of majority shareholders, and one independent director. “In our case, the majority shareholders and one independent director, Ronen Sen, approved the amendment to the agenda,” he said.
 
 “This is not a family-run company. There can’t be any vested claims to continue as a director or a chairperson only by virtue of the fact that one is a shareholder,” he said.
