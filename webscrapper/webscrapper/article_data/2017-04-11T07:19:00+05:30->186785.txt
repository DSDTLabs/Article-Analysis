AMRITSAR: Ousted Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Jagdish Singh Jhinda on Monday rejoined the Sikh Panth after completing religious atonement pronounced upon him by the clergy. The executive committee of the HSGMC had removed him from the post of the president on Sunday for siding with the SGPC.

 Jhinda arrived here at the Akal Takht, along with his colleagues, and underwent the punishment of cleaning utensils for one hour at the langar hall of the Golden Temple. He also offered ‘degh’ of Rs 101 at the takht while praying for forgiveness before being formally inducted into the Panth in the presence of Akal Takht jathedar  .
 
 Talking to TOI, Jhinda said the Akal Takht was supreme and he had completed his punishment as per its direction. He, however, refrained from commenting on the HSGMC’s executive body’s decision of removing him from the post of the president.
 
 Meanwhile, the Sarbat Khalsa ‘jathedar’ of Takht Damdama Sahib Baba Baljit Singh Daduwal said that the executive committee of the HSGMC had decided to remove Jhinda from the top post and appoint senior-most member   as the president. Daduwal is also an executive committee member of the HSGMC.
 
 Jhinda was found guilty of allegedly conniving with the Congress for creating a rift in the SGPC and forming the HSGMC. He was excommunicated from Sikh Panth on July 16, 2014, along with the then Haryana finance minister, Harmohinder Singh Chatha and Nalvi, and of the three only Jhinda decided to appear before the Akal Takht. On April 4, Jhinda voluntarily appeared before the Sikh clergy that pronounced mild atonement upon him, paving way for him to rejoin the Sikh Panth.
 
 Nalwi told TOI that he still stood by his decision of a separate gurdwara management body for the Sikhs of Haryana. “I will also bow before the Akal Tkaht but only if the SGPC recognizes the HSGMC as a separate body,” he maintained.
