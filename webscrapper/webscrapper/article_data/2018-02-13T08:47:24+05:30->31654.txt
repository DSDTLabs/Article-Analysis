JAIPUR: Dalit groups have expressed disappointment over the Budget. In a press release issued by several groups under one umbrella, Dalit activists have said the   offered only symbolic gestures that would make little difference on the ground. About 17% of the state’s nearly seven crore population is Dalit.

 Dalit rights activist and journalist   said, “Even though this is chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s last Budget, she has offered little to the most vulnerable sections of the state.” He remarked that although several instances of murderous attacks on Dalits have been reported, nothing has been done to offer better security to this group. No livelihood opportunities that would benefit them have been proposed either.
 
  of Budget Analysis and Research Centre said, “The CM has made Rs 114 crore allocation for loan waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh for those who have availed loans under SC/ST  . What is problematic is that the plan and non-plan division in the Budget has been done away with, so we no longer have an SC/ST sub-plan. Earlier, we had something to measure against, we had a mechanism for making an allocation in accordance with proportion of population. With that gone, we are not clear how budgeting is done now for these groups.”
 
 The press release issued by the Dalit groups said, “Nagar palikas will build Ambedkar bhawans (an allocation of Rs 80 crore has been made for this). But of what use are they, specifically for Dalits? Community halls for public are built routinely, and it will not make much difference to name these after Ambedkar.”
