 The move ahead of the state assembly elections has not gone down well with the locals in the region. 
 
 During a press conference organised on Tuesday, prominent activists claimed that the state government is willing to fulfil the demand raised by some Kashmiri traders in this regard.
 
 “The   government should not compromise the security of the state for votes. Most of the Kashmiri residents in Mcleodganj are not voters but they are here for business only. Their presence in the region has remained under scanner of security agencies. Local businessmen are already opposing them as they are denting their business prospects and diverting tourists to Kashmir” said Sanjay Sharma, spokesperson, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Academy (HPCA).
 
 Activists said that both Hindu and Hindu communities are living peacefully in the area and no such demand has been raised by permanent Muslim residents as Mosques are already present in the town.
 
 “Kashmiri people have met local MLA and minister Sudhir Sharma who is now pushing for their demand with the state government,” added Sharma.
 
 Activists said that government should stop this procedure immediately otherwise they can go to any extent to oppose the move.
