NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of   on Thursday sternly directed the Maharashtra government to appoint seniormost professors as the   ( ) or   ( ) in all departments of Super Speciality Hospital (SSH).

 The court also warned that the principal secretary of medical education and research will be summoned if the government failed to fill up posts of associate professors in its cardiology department. 
 
 The state government was further told to come clear on filling up the vacant posts in the gastroenterology department.
 
 A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Indira Jain granted last chance of two weeks to complete these formalities.
 
 The court’s directives came after amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out that Dr Manish Shrigiriwar, appointed SSH’s OSD, was suddenly shunted out to Yavatmal and was replaced by Dr Mukund Deshpande.
 
 Government pleader Bharti Dangre then filed an affidavit stating that Shrigiriwar was quite junior to other officers and seven complaints were received against him. 
 
 The judges then asked the government whether it had made same set of rules while appointing HODs/OSDs for other departments. The plea was adjourned for 10 days after Dangre sought time to reply. 
 
 The court was hearing a PIL filed by CH Sharma and others, regarding lack of facilities in government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCHs) across Vidarbha.
 
 During the last hearing, the high court had directed the deans of GMC, IGGMC and SSH to go ahead with purchases of equipment without waiting for administrative approval from the government.
