I felt that Vivek’s story had the potential to engage and have audiences come out of the cinema hall happy, while also giving them a subtle socially-relevant message,” says Rekha, who teamed up with AR Yashwanth to produce the film under the banner, Rekha Movies. She will also be seen as a supporting actor in the film. 
 
 In the lead is TV actor Bharat, along with Sonal Monteiro. Rekha’s sister, Seema, debuts as a supporting character in the film that goes on floors in April.
