VADODARA:   or ‘mehsul’ might be a small amount that many may ignore paying, but it landed   officials of the Vadodara taluka in trouble. The officials had since years been ignoring collection of the tax till the   (TDO) took a decision to hold their salaries for the month of March.

 The TDO issued orders to hold the salaries of 41 talatis or village development officers, two circle inspectors and an assistant TDO as the recovery of an amount to the tune of Rs 4 crore was pending against a demand of around Rs 9 crore. The TDO even instructed the district panchayat not to disburse his own salary in wake of the weak recovery.
 
  said that the land revenue in the taluka was largely for land on which residential, industrial and commercial properties has come up besides some land used for agriculture. “The recovery was very weak and we had even issued notices to the officials last month in wake of the situation,” he said.
 
 Sinora said that the recovery of the tax is to be done from the person holding possession of the property. “The amount is very less, but still the recovery has to be done. It runs into larger amounts only when it has not been paid for years. The tax in case of even large properties runs into only a few hundred rupees per annum,” he added.
 
 The TDO added that he had asked the district panchayat to hold his salary on moral grounds. “Even I am morally responsible and cannot take salary while holding that of others,” he said.
 
 The officials have been told that if they complete half the recovery due in their jurisdictions, their salaries will be disbursed. The strict posture has already started bearing results.   said that nearly 35% of the pending recovery has already been done. “We hope to reach the halfway mark soon following which the salaries will be disbursed,” he added.
