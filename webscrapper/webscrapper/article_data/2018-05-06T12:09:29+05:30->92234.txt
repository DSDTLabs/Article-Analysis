NAGPUR:   women coach   became second from the region to join the   fold after Pravin Hinganikar. Hinganikar, a former Vidarbha skipper joined the neighbour country in March as a curator.

 
 Jain, a former India women wicketkeeper, will take over as head coach of the Bangladesh women team after former England allrounder  's contract wasn't renewed.
 
 "I had a wonderful time with Vidarbha last season and they really wanted to extend my contract by one more year at least. Even I wanted to continue," Jain was quoted as saying by Wisden India.
 
 "They ( ) were not happy initially when I told them about this opportunity, but have been very supportive after understanding how big an opportunity this is for me. They have not yet started searching for my replacement and said that they will start the process once all my formalities get completed," Jain, who was also a national selector, added.
 
 A VCA official also confirmed the development. "She was doing a great job with our girls. We wanted her to change our players' mindset and our girls were on right track. However, this Bangladesh opportunity was big for her. It's a big loss for us but we can't stop someone's progress. Our girls were also enjoying under her and progressing well," an official, who doesn't wish to be named told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Jain was looking after Vidarbha senior and Under-23 teams. Vidarbha senior team topped the group in Plate Group One-day tournament but lost to Bengal in the knock-outs. Vidarbha, however, struggled in Twenty20. Vidarbha Under-23 team also did well in patches.
