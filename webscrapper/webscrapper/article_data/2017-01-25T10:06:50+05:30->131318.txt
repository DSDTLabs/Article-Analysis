  A feasibility study for constructing dedicated utility ducts for   should be conducted by the corporation. To track or locate the cables laid by the companies,   or   should be purchased. The track rent from each telecom service provider should be collected after identifying the number and length of cables laid by them. Special audits should be conducted to keep tabs on the track rent paid by telecom firms. If not paid, council should decide on the fine to be paid by them. Pre-cast drains on the lines of the ones constructed by the KMRL/DMRC should be constructed in the city. 
 
 Conveyor tracks should be installed so as to ensure connectivity between old and new slaughter houses in Kaloor. Heavy fogging machines, hand fogging machines, sprayers etc should be procured to fight mosquito menace. All the drains and canals should be cleaned before the onset of monsoon- P M Harris 
 
  Decentralized waste-treatment plants should be rolled out in the city. The corporation can save on the huge of cost of operating the solid waste plant as well as the transportation charges. 
 
 Setting up of decentralised waste-treatment plants helped in addressing the waste disposal at the  , where more than 50 tonnes of municipal solid waste was being generated every day. 
 
 Using aerobic compost system, the waste will be turned in to manure within 90 to 120 days. Moreover, biogas plants are encouraged in households. The corporation can replicate the model. 
 
 Hotels and eateries should be given financial as well as technical aid for starting biogas plants or other method suitable for them. Hospitals also should asked to set up their own waste management plants- V P Chandran
