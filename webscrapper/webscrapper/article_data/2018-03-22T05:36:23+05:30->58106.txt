THANE: A day after police claimed that actor   had given Hrithik Roshan’s mobile number to lawyer  , she said “proper investigation must be done before drawing assumptions”.

 On Tuesday, DCP (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe said it was found that Kangana had given a mobile number of Hrithik to Siddiquee in 2016. He said the reason is not known yet and the probe is under way. He also suggested that the investigations threaten to pull the mask off many actors involved in illegally sourcing of CDRs.
 
 On Wednesday, the `Queen’ actor issued a statement, saying: “When we respond to a notice, we give all details to lawyer. To assume that these details were used to violate law and make statements based on that assumption and defame an artist is super lame on Abhishek Trimukhe's part. Proper investigation should be carried out before making assumptions.”
 
 Also, the   claimed that they have summoned Ayesha, wife of Jackie Shroff, as during the analysis of the mobile phones of Siddiquee, it was found that she had sourced CDR of actor Sahil khan from an unidentified source and later gave it to Siddiquee, which is also under probe. 
 
 A senior officer said that Ayesha is likely to visit the crime branch police station to record her statement in a couple of days.
