AHMEDABAD: A group of current and former   students was apprehended for an illegal   by Satellite police from an apartment in Azad Society locality of Nehrunagar early on Friday morning. Police officials said the party was held as a farewell for one of the girls arrested.

  The group of 14 was released on bail late on Friday evening. This is the second major case in two months involving students of premier educational institutes in the city. On February 11, Paldi police had raided an apartment early in the morning after getting noise complaints and apprehended 29 students of the   (NID).
 
  According to Satellite police officials, the city police control room received at 2.30 am from someone at Shyam Sahaj Apartment in Azad Society complaining about incessant loud music from a fifth-floor residence in the ‘A’ wing. A team reached the spot and found a party on in full swing with music and liquor.
 
 Police apprehended 14 youths — nine boys and five girls aged between 18 and 25 years. They were arrested under sections of the revised prohibition law after none of them were found to have valid liquor permits. “Three bottles of various brands of whisky were seized from the spot. Three of those arrested lived at the same premises including the girl for whom the farewell party was being held. The youths are from Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Bharuch in Gujarat besides with two persons from Haryana and Kerala,” said a police investigator, adding that one of the girls arranged for the liquor through a regular bootlegger. Police are yet to get the name of that person.
 
 M U Mashi, inspector of Satellite police station, refused to divulge details of the students’ educational or personal background, saying it has no connection with the case. Paldi police had taken a similar stance in the case last month, where 29 NID students were apprehended.
