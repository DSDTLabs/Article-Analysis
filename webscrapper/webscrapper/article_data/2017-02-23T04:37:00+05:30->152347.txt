AHMEDABAD: The Union ministry of women and child has raised concerns of rising case of “hospitals forcing expecting mothers to undergo caesarian section (C-section) operations” in the country. 

 In a note sent to various states and also to the Gujarat chief secretary, Union minister   has suggested to mandate “public disclosure of information regarding C-sections by hospitals” to curb this practice.
 
 The note states that the WCD ministry will take the issue up with the Union health and state health authorities for to make the putting up of C-section information in the public domain a regular practice. 
 
 The note has quoted a WHO study, which state that worldwide C-sections form just 10% to 15% of total deliveries.
 
  In India, according to the   Survey 4, in states like   it was 34%, Telangana reported 58% deliveries as C-sections. The note also added that the “ministry found that at some private hospitals C-sections formed 75% of total deliveries.”
 
 The WCD ministry urged the Gujarat government to plan an outreach campaign with the medical community and prospective mothers on the issue. Gandhi, in the note to the health department, also pointed out that C-section surgeries have a serious impact not only on the health of the mother but also on her ability to continue work after delivery. 
 
 “In most cases, C-section surgery also affects the reproductive health of women,” the note says. 
 
 A senior health official told TOI, “The note is from the women and child development ministry and suggested public disclosures on C-sections. The concern was that doctors are profiteering by pushing expecting mothers to surgical deliveries instead of natural vaginal birth. The issue will be discussed in our health department in the coming weak,” says the senior health official.
