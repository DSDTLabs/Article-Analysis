SALEM: Buoyed by the   verdict validating her marriage, Hadiya said all she wants now is to start a new life with her husband Shafin Jahan in Kerala after finishing her internship in homoeopathy. She requested her parents to accept Shafin as their son-in-law.

 “My husband called me from Delhi to say the Supreme Court had pronounced our marriage legal and valid,” Hadiya told TOI. “I was overwhelmed when I heard it,” she said. “My husband too was delighted that we have succeeded in the case,” Hadiya said.
  
  
 Hadiya, who was at the centre of controversial ‘Love Jihad’ controversy, is doing her internship in a private homoeopathy medical college and research institute near   in Salem district.
 
 Shafin Jahan had approached the Supreme Court challenging a Kerala high court order that annulled his marriage with Hadiya, previously known as Akhila. A bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D   who heard the case said: “She had married Shafin Jahan of her own free will and consent.” 
  
 
 Hadiya thanked those who stood by her and prayed for her to be reunited with her husband. She said she wanted to live happily with Shafin in Kerala. “Right now, he is working in a private company in Kollam. We don’t have any idea about our future but wish to live in Kerala, preferably Kollam, after I finish my internship” she said.
 
 Hadiya said, “I never wanted to disown my parents. I wish to live with them and my husband.” She hoped her parents would accept Shafin as their son-in-law. “I am just waiting for the last day of my internship. I wish to go Kerala once I complete my studies,” she added.
