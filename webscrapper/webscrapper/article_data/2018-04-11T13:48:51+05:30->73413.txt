TRICHY: Sanitary workers and former domestic breeding checkers on Tuesday staged a sit-in at the   office on Tuesday, demanding that their daily wage be raised to Rs 625 from the present figure of Rs 295. 

 The agitators lamented that they have not been given the due recognition like those working in the Swachh Bharat Mission, despite playing a pivotal role in maintaining the city clean. 
 
 “Many are quick to embark on cleanliness drives but often failed to take campaign up further. The authorities do not listen to our concerns,” said   affiliated to  . 
 
 The district administration and Urban Local Body (ULB) should hike the minimum pay for conservancy workers. As sanitary workers and various self-help groups (SHG) work in about 25 micro compost yards in the city, segregating waste, the petitioners said the district administration must revise the daily wage of sanitary workers particularly in the micro compost yards.
 
 Pointing out the government Order 2(D) 62 from   government, the protesters demanded the arrears from October 2017 should be paid to them.
 
 Besides seeking the payment of arrears, the protesters pitched for the re-employment of   workers for day-to-day cleaning tasks of civic body. Among the demands include deployment of robots and gadgets to remove silt from manholes on underground drainage connections and cleaning of open drainage canals.
