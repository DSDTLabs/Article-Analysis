BHANGAR: A day after   admonished police for their “vague” report on the death of a protester in the firing at   on January 17, the block again witnessed a flare-up on Friday. 

 Residents of 32 villages allegedly blocked roads that connect villages to the highway, to protest against the arrest of a leader spearheading the movement against a power grid project. To counter them, alleged supporters of Bhangar’s Trinamool strongman   reportedly hurled bombs. However, no one was injured. 
 
 As word spread of Kismat Ali Mollah’s arrest on Friday morning, his supporters stopped vehicle movement and staged sit-in demonstrations.
 
 The roadblocks allegedly enraged supporters of Arabul, and around 30 of them fired and hurled bombs at the protesters. They also allegedly kidnapped two supporters of Mollah. Arabul, however, denied all allegations.
 
 Baruipur additional SP   said, “We arrested Mollah on specific charges. His supporters staged roadblocks in protest.” Asked about allegations of bombing by Arabul’s men, Ghosh said, “We have no reports of bombing or firing.”
