AJMER: Rajasthan Pradesh   Committee on Tuesday expelled its two rebels contesting the Mandalgarh assembly bypoll scheduled on January 29. The duo—Gopal Malviya and Mahvir Sharma—has been expelled from party’s primary membership for six years.

 The Congress has fielded Vivek Dhakar as its candidate for the assembly bypoll. To oppose Dhakar candidature, Malviya and   filed nominations as independent candidates. The party leaders asked the duo to withdraw their nominations but they stuck their ground even as last date for withdrawing nominations was Monday (January 15).
 
  vice-president Mumtaj Masih on Tuesday morning released the orders here stating that on the instructions of Congress state president  , the two men have been expelled from the party for next six years. With quick action against rebels, the opposition party has tried to send a message in its ranks that indiscipline will not be tolerated. “For the first time, Congress has acted swiftly against rebels,” claimed a Congress leader here.
 
 Sources said Malviya is an influential leader in Mandalgarh constituency. Malviya and Sharma might damage the party candidate’s prospects in the bypoll. At the same time, several organisations of Rajputs, Ravana Rajputs and Charan Rajputs again declared that they would oppose the BJP candidate in Mandalgarh—Shakti Singh Hada—even though he is a Rajput. Giriraj Singh Lotwada, president of   and convenor of the three communities’ Sangharsh Samiti, had said in Jaipur, “There are 24 Rajput MLAs in BJP here but none dared to oppose atrocities against the three communities in past four years, so we can do without another Rajput MLA since state BJP is targeting us.”
