GURUGRAM: Is the safety of patients, attendants and staff taken into consideration by government hospitals in the city? Doesn’t seem so.

 The false ceiling of the gynaecology   collapsed on Thursday morning. Luckily, no one was injured as the patients hadn’t started queueing up at the   at that time. 
 
 The incident took place at 7:30am on Thursday when a cleaner was performing her duty. According to the cleaner, the plaster from the ward’s ceiling chipped off and a chunk fell on the floor. Within seconds, around four feet long portion of the ceiling came crashing down. 
 
 “The woman, who was sweeping the floor, had just stepped aside to fill water in her bucket when the ceiling collapsed. It was a narrow escape. Though she’s physically fit right now but is going through mental trauma,” a hospital staff said. 
 
 “We have given the project to the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee for repairs. They have collected the samples and a report on the fate of the building is expected is to be submitted within next one month. After which we will be able have a clear picture of what renovations are required and in what matter,” said Dr  , principal medical officer.
 
 In the past two years, around seven such incidents have taken place in the hospital where over 2,500 people visit everyday. The building was constructed in 1967. In 2015, the hospital had been deemed unfit by the PWD.
 
 Notably, the hospital was repaired for Rs 14 crore between 2007 and 2010. Despite that the building is in a shambles.
