PATNA: The   (CAT) on Tuesday sought a reply from   ( )-Patna why its show-cause notices served on the 17 teachers should not be quashed. 

 The notices were served on the basis of a report by the Vikash Arya inquiry committee, which was set up by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in 2012 to probe into the anomalies in the AIIMS-P teachersâ€™ appointment made on the basis of an advertisement published in 2011. The committee had found the faculties ineligible for appointment and submitted its report in 2014. The then AIIMS-P director served the notices after the Union ministry wrote him a letter on February 26 this year to terminate the 17 faculty members from services after following proper procedure.
 
 The Patna bench (CAT) of judicial member   and administrative member Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay of the Patna high court stayed the show-cause notices and sought a reply from AIIMS-P in two weeks as why the notices served four years after the submission of inquiry report should not be quashed.
 
 The original application was filed in the CAT by one of the 17 teachers, Dr Ajeet Kumar Saxena, who was also served a show-cause notice. He alleged that the Arya committee had submitted its report without even taking any feedback from them. He also stated that notices were served after almost four years of submission of the report. 
 
 Advocate  , who appeared on behalf of AIIMS-Patna, said the matter would come up for hearing on April 6.
