MUMBAI: Soon after   salon finance manager   went missing, her family suspected that Siddhesh Tamhankar (28) and Khushi Sahjwani (42) may have something to do with it. This is because the duo had picked her up from near her home on the the day of the incident, while no one from her office had ever come to pick or drop her in the six years she worked there. 

 "We suspected the role of her colleagues when we found the boy and the woman offering her lift on March 16 morning after she stepped out of the building to go to work at around 8.50am. My wife is still unaware about the incident," Kirti's father, Rajendra (68), a retired mill employee, told TOI. "This was the first time someone came to pick my daughter. We suspected the accused who were captured in the CCTV," he added.
 
 "The victim's mother, Surekha, tried to get in touch with her daughter around 11.30am on that day but her two mobiles were switched off," said a crime branch officer. 
 
 "My sister is diabetic. Initially we thought she may gone to her workplace because while leaving for work she told she has got loads of work and will be late coming home on March 16. We got worried when she did not reach even after 10pm," Shefali said. 
 
 The family recalled that Tamhankar (28) was present in the search that her parents and office colleagues carried out. According to sources, the accused accompanied the family thrice to the police station to lodge a complaint and then for probe.
 
 The company tweeted on March 17 @bbluntindia: "We need your help to find our friend and colleague Ms. Kirti Vyas. Please retweet and spread the word." "My sister use to return back by 8pm every day from work. On March 16 she left home at around 8.50am. I suspect something amiss because her two office colleagues claimed that they has accompanied her from Lamington Road but they did not say anything to their seniors in office despite she did not reach workplace," said Shefali, her sister.
