Ghaziabad: When IT professional Deepak Muduli met with a serious accident and slipped into coma in March this year, it pushed his family into penury under the pressure of hefty medical bills. Now, a charity marathon is being organised by his friends to raise funds for Deepak’s treatment.

 The charity marathon, called ‘Run for a runner’, has been slated for July 30 under the banner of ‘Indirapuram Runners (IPR)’ — a group of 163 members.
 
 “Deepak is our most special member and he was the backbone of every marathon organised by IPR. He used to make sure that kids and adults alike, everyone is comfortable and having fun with fitness. Now it is our turn to help him back,” said an IPR member.
 
 On the night of March 2, Deepak went into a coma after a road accident left him with a serious head injury and multiple rib fractures.
 
 Deepak’s treatment has been extensively expensive to sustain without a regular monthly income, but his wife has been managing it somehow. “The monthly expense of his medical bills amounts to Rs 1,20,000. I am trying to manage my best but I now need a job. Whatever support we are getting is from IPR members only,” said Deepak’s wife, Monjulika.
 
 “The marathon is solely being organised to spread the message that in times of need like this all of us stand united. There are three distance categories — 3 km, 5 km and 10 km. The registration fee for the first two categories is Rs 500 and for the 10 km run, it is Rs 700. People can register from an online link and the amount will be credited into Deepak’s account,” said Shruti, another IPR member.
