As a parent scurried around asking for a glue stick to paste his daughter’s photo on her admit card, another grabbed a pair of scissors to cut sacred threads on her daughter’s wrist. A student rushed out of the hall to get her parent sign the hall ticket, while a group of people frantically searched for a candidate’s gold stud that fell to the ground while being removed. Sunday’s   seemed to be a test not just for students but also for their parents as they tried to comply with CBSE’s rules.

 Amidst the sweltering heat, girls let their hair loose as they removed their rubber bands and clips. Jewellery, shoes, hijab and burkha, belts, all were barred, sacred threads on hands cut and handkerchiefs grabbed even if it meant runny noses. With many students forgetting to get a passport size photo, several schools arranged for photographers inside the premises, some of them charging ?30 to ?50.
 
 
 Snega Priya, a candidate, said: “I was devastated that I hadn’t brought an extra photograph and asked my mother to get a copy from my hall ticket. I had to wait till she returned by 9.20am and so it was a rushed entry,” she said.
 
 As students wrote the three-hour test, scores of parents waited outside or in the adjacent streets, and not unprepared – armed with lunch boxes, newspapers and coffee flasks, parents spread out on pavements and apartment entrances ready to sit out in the sun. Heavy police security was deployed around exam centres and special parking allowance was also given.
 
 Azhagappan, a parent, felt that the dress code was “too much” for an exam. “Agreed they are taking precautions against malpractices, but the way they do it only causes chaos. Students become anxious and over-stressed right before the exam. What if they go blank during the exam after so much hard work. A systematic and calm checking process benefits all,” he said.
