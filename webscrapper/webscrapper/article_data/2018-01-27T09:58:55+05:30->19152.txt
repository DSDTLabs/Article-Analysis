Commuters at   signal have something to be happy. As per the department of state highways, a study will be conducted soon to construct ramps or elevated corridors at the signal junction.

 "The original design was completely different. We had no other choice but to change it due to the land acquisition issues. We have sent a proposal to the state government to study this junction and come up with a design to construct ramps to allow people to use the flyover at this junction," said an official. After the second level is completed, work will begin on this, added the official.
 
 According to officials, if they had to set up ramps, almost all the showrooms and shops located up to 8m on both sides of the road will have to be removed. "People were not agreeing for this. If shops were removed, people would stop using the flyover. So we decided to alter the design," said an official.
 
 "Currently 40% of the population is using the first level of the flyover. They comprise commuters who are travelling from   towards Avinashi Road. Also, those coming towards Sathy Road from   junction use the flyover," said an official. This project was designed keeping in mind cityâ€™s population in 2050. "It will definitely benefit the commuters," said an official.
 
 Residents and activists said that this was a total waste of money. "This is a way to earn extra money by government officials. They should have included the cross-cut road signal in their first design itself. What is the point of spending extra money and designing it after the  . How many individually disconnected elevated corridors will we have in the city," asked an activist.
