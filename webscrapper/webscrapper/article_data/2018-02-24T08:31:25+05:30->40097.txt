CAPE TOWN: Back at Newlands, where the tour of South Africa began on an unceremonious note for India as a Test match was lost, Kohli and Co. will look to make amends on their final visit. This is where the long tour of South Africa comes to an end on Saturday.

 
 This time, the honours will circle around the T20I format as Cape Town hosts the third of the three-match series, which is locked 1-1.
 
 
 
 The match was a full house way before the second T20 in Centurion ended up in a win for South Africa, ensuring that the series stays alive. And while it did, the win came in a remarkable fashion - South Africa riding on   and skipper JP Duminy’s blistering half-centuries to chase 189 runs on a wicket that wasn’t the easiest to bat on. In the process, the hosts bring along with them immense confidence, giving themselves the much-needed psychological arsenal to once again challenge the otherwise rampaging Indians.
 
 
 
 The visitors, nevertheless, see the Centurion blip as a one-off. Only, this time, they expect two of their most dangerous bowlers in the shorter format - pacer   and chinaman   - to be fit on the day of the clash. Yadav in the middle overs and Bumrah at death is what India need, given the way Klaasen and Duminy went about building South Africa’s case in Centurion.
 
 Friday witnessed light but constant drizzle around Cape Town as clouds hovered over the city, blowing towards the Table Mountain and away. For a region so severely affected by its first potential drought in over a 100 years, any sign of rain could only be a welcome factor.
 
 Cricket, nevertheless, remains immaterial in front of a massively looming natural disaster and if rain means a washout, the Eastern Cape will end up being the real winner.
 
 However, if the rain does stay away, any team winning the toss here and batting first will happily find a score in excess of 150 to be a competitive one. Expect Newland’s well-known assistance to swing bowling to come into play.
