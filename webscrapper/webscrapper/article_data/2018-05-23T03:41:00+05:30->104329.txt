Panaji: Alleging that many newly-married women face harassment and abuse because of the government’s Laadli Laxmi scheme, the Goa Mahila Congress on Tuesday demanded that the scheme be amended.  Goa Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho told reporters that this issue, along with others, was raised by around 30 Mahila Congress members who met governor Mridula Sinha on Tuesday. Coutinho suggested that the scheme amount of Rs 1 lakh be given to girls once they turn 18 years old to enable them to pursue higher education or take up some skill courses. “A girl should be able to earn and be independent,” she said.  Goa Mahila Congress vice president Beena Naik, meanwhile, demanded that more women doctors be posted at public health centres in the state. Naik said that many of the primary health centres do not have woman doctors, thus compelling women to approach the district hospitals. Savitri Kavlekar, a member, highlighted the need for separate women cells to be set up at all police stations.
