Rajkot: The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) will supply 24-hour water supply in selected areas after installing water meters from April 15. The pilot project, along with some others worth Rs 150 crore, will be inaugurated by chief minister Vijay Rupani. In February too, CM had inaugurated projects worth Rs 175 crore in his home town Rajkot.

 The civic body had announced in its budget proposal for 2018-19 to give 24-hour water supply in few residential areas as a pilot project. Under the project, in Chandreshnagar water supply zone RMC will provide 24-hour water supply to individual residences by installing water meter from April 15. 
 
 RMC will issue water bill for these houses at an interval of two months and for that the civic body has hired an agency. RMC in an official statement claims that by installing the meter, it could reduce water wastage as those who use more water will have to shell out more.
