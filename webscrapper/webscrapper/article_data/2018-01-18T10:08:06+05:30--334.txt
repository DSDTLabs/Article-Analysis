Ava Mukherjee, who played Shah Rukh Khan’s grandmother in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Devdas’, has reportedly passed away at the age of 88. Even though she had forayed into acting with the 
  ‘Ram Dhakka’ in 1966, her film career took off with a brief role in Sunhil Sippy’s 2000 film ‘Snip!’, after which she went on to play the benevolent grandmother to SRK’s alcoholic Devdas. 

 She followed this by screen turns in the   and Ram Gopal Varma-produced 2006 horror anthology, ‘Darna Zaroori Hai’, and the titular role in ‘Detective Nani’, a kiddie film directed by Mukherjee’s daughter, Romilla. Before entering showbiz, Mukherjee had worked as a copywriter, translator and writer.
