LUCKNOW: Governor   is upset with the   after it failed to respond to his query. 

 A statement issued from Raj Bhawan on Friday said Naik had been invited by an NGO to unveil a statue of a freedom fighter in   on January 7. But since the model code of conduct has been imposed in the state, Naik sought EC’s opinion on whether he could attend such programmes. 
 
 “More than 48 hours have passed but the Commission is yet to respond to the governor. As a result, governor had to cancel his programme,” statement said.
 
 Raj Bhawan officials told TOI that governor is upset over the EC not responding to his query even when he is the constitutional head of the state. They added that Raj Bhawan was told by the office of UP chief electoral officer that governor’s query had been forwarded to the Election Commission of India, Delhi, for clarification. But the delay in response left Naik miffed because he had to cancel the programme.
