KOLKATA: The stretch of Park Circus connector adjoining Tangra’s Chinatown remained waterlogged on Thursday with the only relief to motorists and locals being that some of the accumulated water dried up as it was a sunny day.

 Last week’s light shower had left the stretch inundated. Though   ( ) drainage and sewage department officials admitted to the problem and said they were working to unclog a choked drain along EM Bypass, there was no evidence of it bearing any result on the ground.
 
 “Though it rained just a little, the road remained under water for over five days. If it rains again, the entire stretch will get inundated. Even now, residents wihtout cars are being forced to make a nearly 2-km detour to access Chinatown via  ,”   secretary Chen Khoi Kui said.
 
 Though roads within Tangra have improved considerably in the last decade and streets inside Chinatown are free from major  , the situation on the connector has remained unchanged. While earlier the absence of drains was blamed for the waterlogging, setting up of a drainage channel along the road has not mitigated the issue.
 
 For locals, this is a major grouse as restaurants that are accessed from the Chinatown gate take a major hit every time the road is inundated. “No customer would want to wade through filthy water to dine. Every monsoon, our business take a hit because of this,” said the owner of a restaurant along the stretch.
 
 Some feel the problem is getting less attention because of the Maa flyover that runs over it. “With politicians, bureaucrats and other important persons using the flyover, no attention is paid to what happens below,” said a local resident.
 
 KMC officials denied any stepmotherly treatment towards the road and said heavy equipment was deployed to clear the choked area that led to water spilling over from the drains. “The problem is such that it is taking time. Once the choked area is cleared, water will flow away automatically,” a civic official said.
