KOLKATA: A 46-year-old woman   on her bed when the room caught fire, possibly from a burning  , on Friday at   in Behala. 

 The woman, Ranu Roy, had closed the iron doors of her room on the terrace along with that leading to the terrace from inside. This prevented her family members to rescue when they were alerted by smoke from her room. Almost 30 minutes into the fire, an elderly neighbour flung a ladder from his terrace to the woman's house, creating a bridge. The family then broke a portion of the wall above the door and the lean neighbour sneaked through the 3.5ft gap to open the door. But by that time, Roy was already dead.
 
 Roy worked at the records department of  's solid waste management department. Family members said she used to suffer from a number of ailments including epilepsy and high blood pressure and had the habit of taking sleeping pills regularly. 
 
 Doctors who checked Roy said she had burn injuries and had also choked on the bed. 
 
 "We have sent the body for post-mortem," said a Parnasree police officer. Cops did not rule out the chance of fire from burning cigarette ends as the woman used to smoke.
