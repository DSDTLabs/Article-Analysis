Ghaziabad: A 58-year-old man wanted in 28 cases of murder and kidnapping in Ghaziabad, Delhi and   was arrested on Tuesday. Ashok   was arrested by an   team from near the toll plaza along NH-58 on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Pehelwan, who had been arrested earlier and was awarded a life term, had escaped from police custody six years ago from Delhi’s AIIMS where he was undergoing treatment for an kidney ailment.
 
 “We received a tip-off that Ashok Pehelwan, who was wanted in 28 cases and was on the run for many years, would be coming to Ghaziabad. We laid a trap and when he reached toll plaza along NH-58 we arrested him,” said an STF officer.
 
 “The accused carried a reward of Rs 5,000 on his head and he was awarded a life term in a kidnapping and murder case by the Ghaziabad court. However, in 2006 he managed to give police a slip from AIIMS where he was undergoing treatment from a congenital kidney ailment.”
 
 Ashok has 22 cases of robbery, kidnapping and murder registered in different police stations in Ghaziabad, including a sensational triple murder case in 2008 where he gunned down a property dealer   and his two private bodyguards. 
 
 There are also five cases against him in Delhi and one in Mathura.
