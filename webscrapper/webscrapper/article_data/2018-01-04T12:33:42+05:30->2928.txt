LUCKNOW: BSP chief   on Wednesday attacked the   over violence in Pune during the   Shaurya Sabha, comparing it with caste violence in UP’s Saharanpur district in May last year.

 She said BJP supporters with a casteist mindset had attacked Dalits and taken the law in their hands while the party leadership chose to keep mum.
 
 The BSP chief invoked   saying that the BJP attacked people from the Mahar community, known to be a warrior class. Ambedkar was also a Mahar. Mayawati said that Koregaon gained more prominence after Ambedkar visited the place on January 1, 1927, to pay homage to Mahar warriors.
 
 She said the community had been organising Koregaon Shaurya Sabha for many years.
 
 “The 200-year anniversary of the Sabha was special and it was the duty of the Maharashtra government to ensure proper security for the people there,” she said.
 
 The former UP chief minister categorically slammed the Maharashtra government, saying it kept its eyes closed during the violence.
 
 “Such violence could not have happened without the backing of the BJP government,” she said, terming the judicial inquiry set up by the Maharashtra government as nothing but an “eyewash”.
 
 Mayawati said incidents of atrocities on Dalits had been on the rise in BJP-ruled states and that in most cases, victims had not got justice.
 
 “This has emboldened BJP supporters and they are suppressing Dalits with even more ferocity,” she said.
 
 Meanwhile, BSP sources said the issue is likely to be taken up by party MPs in the   on Thursday. On Wednesday, BSP MP Satish Chandra Mishra sought a discussion on the issue but could not succeed following a din after BJP tabled the triple talaq bill.
