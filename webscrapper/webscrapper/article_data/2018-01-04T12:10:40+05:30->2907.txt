LUCKNOW: The   alleged   was transferred to Rajkiya Shishu Bal Griha on Wednesday by the   (CWC).

 The minor mother remained in the women’s shelter home she was brought to on Monday. The transfer of the child was made following the survivor’s unwillingness to keep the child.
 
 A second counselling session of the young mother was conducted by CWC on Wednesday. “She is totally indifferent towards the child. She could not and did not want to nurture the child. It was decided to send the child to the children’s home where he can be taken care of,” said CWC member Sangeeta Sharma.
 
 “Since the girl’s mother has not turned up at the shelter home, we have halted the surrender of the baby for adoption. It will be done soon,” she added.
 
 The 12-year-old resident of Indiranagar’s Suggamau area was allegedly raped by her neighbour earlier this year.
