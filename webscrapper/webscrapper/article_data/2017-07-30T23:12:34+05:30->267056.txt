Hyderabad: City-based poultry player  , has entered into a strategic tie-up with US-based poultry layer genetics player Hy-Line International for distributing the latter’s commercial layers throughout India.

 Announcing the partnership, Srinivasa Group vice-chairman and managing director Suresh Chitturi told mediapersons that the two would be forming a joint venture in which Srinivasa Group would be responsible for selling chicks to poultry farms nationwide and Hy-Line would look after the genetics part. Hy-Line would hold a majority stake in the JV.
 
 Chitturi also said that Srinivasa Group would be investing Rs 300 crore in putting up chicken processing and egg powder facilities at the mega food park in Andhra Pradesh’s Prakasam district as well as a chicken processing unit with a 2,000 birds per hour capacity on the outskirts of Hyderabad. While the processing unit at Prakasam, which will take 18 months to be ready, will make ready-to-eat products like chicken nuggets, burger patties, chicken samosas and stuffed parathas and the egg powder plant will process 0.5million eggs per day.
 
 The Hyderabad facility, which will kick off by the end of the year, will process raw chicken and make sausages and ham by January 2019, Chitturi said. According to Chitturi, the expansion would be funded primarily by internal accruals and the group may resort to fund raising later, if need be.
 
 Talking about the Indian poultry market, Chitturi said it is around Rs 1 lakh crore and is expected to grow at 8-10% over the next few years. “The potential is enormous when one considers the fact that just 65 eggs are consumed per capita in India as compared to a country like Japan where it is 330 eggs per capita,” he said. Jonathan Cade, president, Hy-Line International, said: “We see the enormous potential of genetically superior Hy-Line layers to feed the growing population of India an inexpensive source of protein through a partnership with Srinivasa Group.”
