HYDERABAD: An astounding 168 million gallons of water per day (MGD) supplied by the   to the city gets wasted or is unaccounted for due to illegal connections. Troubled officials have now decided to carry out a survey and plug the gaps.

 The residents of the city and its peripheral circles are supplied 378.28 MGD, but only 209.94 MGD is accounted for. Even the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) does not know where the remaining 168.34 MGD disappears. If this water could be saved, it can serve 2 lakh customers, officials said.
 
 The Water Board is already unable to meet the city’s demand of 601 MGD and struggles with a deficit of 223 MGD. “It is a tough task ahead as summer has made an early entry. We are busy preparing a summer action plan. It seems we will have to depend on Godavari and Krishna water,” an official said.
 
 Officials cite various reasons for the water loss such as  , inaccuracies in metering, transmission and distribution leakages as well as leakages from storage tanks. 
 
 “The primary reasons is use of old water pipelines and trunk mains, where leakages are common. To find out the exact reasons for water loss, the Water Board has decided to conduct door-to-door survey. We have invited firms to submit their Expression of Interest and will start the process in a day or two,” HMWS&SB director-revenue, D Sridhar Babu, told TOI.
 
 The survey will be initiated in Operation and Maintenance divisions V (Narayanguda), VI (S R Nagar) and VII (Marredpally). “We have told customers to fix water meters and threatened to impose penalties if they don’t. We will file cases if illegal connections are identified during flash raids,” Babu said.
