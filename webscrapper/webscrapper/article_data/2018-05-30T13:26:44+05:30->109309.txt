MADURAI: With vacations drawing to a close, omni buses are at it again and hundreds of touts are seen selling tickets from morning at the Mattuthavani   stand.

 
  The fares have once again gone up by up to Rs 300 since the regular buses have been completely booked. Many desperate passengers who failed to book their tickets in advance are virtually paying more for lesser facilities.
 
 Anxious to get back on time for the first day at school on June 4, many who came to Madurai and the southern districts with their families for the school holidays were seen running from one tout to another to get tickets. 
 
  of Chennai says he has been going to the   bus stand for the past two days trying to get tickets for his family of six on a bus. ``I cannot afford more than Rs 3,000, but the fares are so high that it comes up to Rs 5,000 even on non-AC buses. I tried train tickets but to no avail,’’ he said.
 
 Nearly 100 touts are seen swarming the bus stand in the morning and evening, pestering the passengers with offers of seats. 
 
 An omni operator who has his shop at the bus stand said that many operators didn’t figure on ticket booking sites and relied on touts to get passengers. While the regular fares range from Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 per person on air-conditioned buses, the holiday season has seen them going up by a few hundred rupees.
 
 But the fly-by-night operators have been offering non-AC seats at fares even more than those charged by regular air-conditioned buses. What is worse, the seats are bad and some passengers are even asked to share them with others for a slightly lesser fare. 
 
 Those who failed to get tickets have decided to travel back midweek. 
 
 L  , a software engineer said that the tout menace was quite bad as they were rude and kept pulling the bags of passengers.   source said that they would conduct checks at the bus stand this week to control the menace.
