NEW DELHI: Home minister   on Tuesday justified his praise for people from Kashmir for condemning the 
  , and said all Kashmiris were not terrorists. He added that it was his job to ensure peace and tranquillity across the country. 

  
  
 The justification came following criticism of the home minister from a Twitter handle for saying that denunciation of the attack on pilgrims showed that the “spirit of Kashmiriyat was very much alive”. 
 
  
  
 
 The editor of an online travel portal came down heavily on Singh and said no one cared whether Kashmiriyat was alive or not and that he should focus on punishing those who had attacked the yatris.
 
 
 
 
  Singh, in an unusual move, joined issue with her. “I certainly do. It is absolutely my job to ensure peace and tranquillity in all parts of the country. All Kashmiris are not terrorists,” he said. The editor’s Twitter account was soon deleted. 
 
  
  
 
 Praising the people of J&K for coming out against terrorists, the home minister had told reporters, “I am pained at the loss of lives of Amarnath pilgrims. But I salute the people of Kashmir as all sections of society have condemned the attack.” Singh also tweeted, “It shows the spirit of Kashmiriyat is very much alive.”
