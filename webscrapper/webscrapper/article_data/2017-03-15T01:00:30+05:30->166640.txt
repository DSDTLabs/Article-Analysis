MOTIHARI: The town police on Tuesday arrested ASI and in-charge of Naka number 1 of town Dhananjay Singh after recovering from his house the money he had illegally seized from a local gold merchant during checking near Gandhi Tower roundabout Saturday night.   Town police station SHO Ajay Kumar said the case was under investigation.    Police sources said Chhotan Jha, an employee of jeweller Manoj Kumar, lodged a case with Town police station on Sunday alleging that the police team led by Dhananjay frisked him and took the Rs8.80 lakh he was carrying while on way from Patna Saturday night. Jha said he was asked to come to the Naka number 1 on Sunday as the police had to check the currency.    Jha said he immediately informed Manoj and they reached the Naka on Sunday morning, but the ASI refused to identify him and said he had not seized any amount from him.    The victim then reached the Town police station and narrated the story to the SHO and lodged a case in this regard. The case was also brought to the notice of S P Jitendra Rana and action was initiated. The ASI initially denied the allegation, but later confessed to his crime leading to the recovery of the seized money from his house.    The police, after recovery of the money, arrested the ASI. “The four constables who were in the police team at the time of the incident, would face departmental proceedings,” a police source said.
