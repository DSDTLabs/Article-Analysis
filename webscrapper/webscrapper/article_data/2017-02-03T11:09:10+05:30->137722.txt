JALANDHAR: A day after Dera Sacha Sauda of Sirsa announced its support for SAD-BJP candidates in Punjab and nine Akali leaders directing the sect followers to hold satsang (congregation) in their respective constituencies, various Sikh leaders and organizations have asked the Akal Takht Jathedar to take action against the Akali leaders.

 The Sikh bodies have also asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), Damdami Taksal and other prominent Sant Samaj leaders to clear their stand after the Akali Dal, which controls the main Panthic institutions, violated the Akal Takht directive of severing ties with the Sirsa dera.
 
 Former SGPC general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, who resigned from the Akali Dal after Bargari sacrilege incident and had recently joined the AAP , said either the Akal Takht Jathedar and other Jathedars should take immediate action against the nine Akali leaders or they themselves should resign.
 
 “Those who project themselves as leaders of the Sant Samaj, including Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Dhuma, should clarify their stand afresh as they recently announced support to the SAD,“ Bhaur said, adding that he was asking for action as the SAD was controlling all Pan thic institutions and it was not like other secular parties that did not claim to champion cau se of Sikhs or controlled their institutions.
 
 He also asked the SGPC to make its stand clear. “Any vote to Akali Dal would be support to Barghari sacrilege as it has come out now that who was behind it and then covering up the case,“ he said here on Thursday while spea king to media.
 
 Addressing a press confe rence here,   leader   said Akali leadership was pushing the state to brink of a turmoil and violence.
 
 He said the SGPC, DSGMC, granthis of Darbar Sahib and Sikh Sants and per sonalities, including Taksal chief Harnam Singh Dhuma and former Akjal Takht Jathe dar Jasbir Singh Rode, should make their stand clear and should dissociate themselves from the Akali Dal.
