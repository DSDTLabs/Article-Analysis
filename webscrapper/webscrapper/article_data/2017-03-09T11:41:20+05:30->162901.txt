HYDERABAD: Giving a big shock to both Telangana and  , the AK Bajaj committee that was appointed by the Centre to resolve water disputes between two states has refused to look into the Godavari water diversion controversy. Instead, the high-power committee has written a letter to the Union water resources ministry seeking clarification on its role in deciding the water sharing. The sudden volte-face by the committee has shocked the two states which were banking on the committee to resolve their water disputes. 

 In a letter written to the Union ministry's joint secretary on Monday, NN Rai, director of   ( ) who is member secretary of the committee, sought to know whether it is required to look into the sharing of Godavari water between the two states. The member-secretary pointed that it may not proceed further without proper clarification on the matter.
 
 "During the discussions, the AP government has taken a stand that the allocation of water comes under the   constituted as per the Inter-State Water Disputes Act. In case the committee does decide to address the issue, then it should also keep in view the diversions through various lift schemes from Godavari by the Telangana government which is the upper riparian state," pointed out the member-secretary.
 
 On the other hand, the Telangana government wants the committee to go ahead with allocation of Godavari water and give some interim sharing arrangement as decided in the apex council meeting till the matter is finally decided by the KWDT-II. "The Telangana also opposed the AP argument on the diversion of Godavari water by Telangana since the provision of Godavari water diversion to Krishna under KWDT-I is a standalone one-time provision whilst Godavari water diversion by Telangana under GWDT is a totally different issue," explained NN Rai.
