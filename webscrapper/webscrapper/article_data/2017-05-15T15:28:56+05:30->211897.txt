NEW DELHI: With victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in their final league match of  ,   sealed the top spot on the leaderboard and maintain their reputation as the team to beat this season. 

 The Reliance-owned franchise has made the knockouts of the   in seven of ten seasons, winning the pennant on two occasions (2013 and 2015) and thrice not progressing past the league stage in 2008, 2009 and 2016. Ahead of the first Qualifier between Mumbai and Rising Pune Supergiant, TOI Sports takes a look at how Mumbai have fared in IPL play-offs, and on whose shoulders they have done well. 
 
 Mumbai's leading run-getter in play-offs is the West Indian allrounder   with 268 at an average of 29.77, but more importantly a strike-rate of 179 and with 21 sixes and 17 fours. Pollard has two Man-of-the-Match awards in play-offs, which underlines his important in must-win clashes. 
 
  
  
 The first came in the franchise's maiden appearance beyond the league stage in 2010, when Royal Challengers Bangalore were beaten by 35 runs in the semi-finals. Here, Pollard's unbeaten 33 off 13 balls was pivotal to MI getting a strong finish -   made 52* off 31 balls - to end on 184/5, and then the allrounder's 3/17 in four overs snuffed out RCB's charge. The second came in the second qualifier of the 2015 season, when he hit 41 off 17 balls - with five sixes - to heavily influence a 25-run win over CSK. 
 
 At second in Mumbai's play-off history is Ambati Rayudu who has been with the franchise for all seasons. In play-offs, Rayudu has made 210 runs in ten innings at a strike-rate of 121, hitting 19 fours and two sixes. 
 
 At third is a batsman who could really influence Mumbai's success in the 2017 playoffs, based on what he has done in his past matches in the same stage. In three play-off games,   has racked up 197 runs in 140 balls, with fifties on each occasion. In the 2014 Eliminator, he hit 67 off 44 balls as Mumbai were beaten; in 2015, he helped put them in the final with 62 off 51 balls in Qualifier 1 and then in the summit clash, laced 68 off 45 balls to help them win the title. 
 
 Surprisingly, given his pedigree and career tally of nearly 6500 runs in Twenty20 cricket, Rohit Sharma has not performed well for Mumbai in IPL play-offs barring the 2015 final, where he was Man of the Match for hitting 50 off 26 balls to help set up a 41-run win over CSK. In his other eight innings, Rohit has scored just 78 runs. Overall in IPL play-offs, he has a tally of 128 runs at 14.22 with a poor strike-rate of 111. 
 
 Mumbai's most successful bowlers in play-offs are Harbhajan Singh and Lasith Malinga with 12 and 11 wickets in ten matches each. The pair, who like Pollard have played only for MI across ten seasons, have been pivotal members to the franchise's success. Harbhajan's 12 wickets in IPL play-offs have come at 23.58 runs a piece and his economy rate has been 7.45. Malinga has the same economy but a higher average of 28.09. 
 
 In addition to his batting and superb catching, Pollard has taken 10 wickets in IPL play-offs at a strike-rate of 17.4 while conceding runs at 8.34 an over. 
 
 In IPL 2017, Mumbai's batting chart is headed by Pollard who has 362 runs in 13 innings at a strike-rate of 141.40, with three fifties and several cameos. Rayudu, owing first to injury and then to team combinations, has made just two appearances but in his return in Mumbai's final league game, was Man of the Match for his 37-ball 63 as KKR were beaten by nine runs to seal the top spot on the leaderboard. Simmons made a belated appearance but in four matches has 126 runs at 31.50, with two fifties and a strike-rate of 148.23. 
 
 Harbhajan (8) and Malinga (9) are behind Mitchell McClenaghan (18), Jasprit Bumrah (15) and Hardik Pandya (10) in the team's bowling chart this season.
