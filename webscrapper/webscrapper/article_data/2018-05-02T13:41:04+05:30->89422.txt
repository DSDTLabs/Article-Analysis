Ankush Hazra, who has about 15 Bengali movies to his credit, is currently focussing on his physical health. After his short sabbatical, the actor is back to work. He is currently in Mumbai working on his fitness.

 Ankush is reportedly focusing on kickboxing, gymnastics and weight training. This intense training session will continue for the next two and half months and then he will be back in Kolkata for the shooting of ‘D 4 Dance’. After he completes the shoot of this dance film, he will return to Mumbai.
 
 Ankush reportedly wants to choose his next films cautiously because he believes it’s time to test his acting skills in films that are more content driven. The actor also added that he doesn’t want to limit himself anymore. According to him, the content is obviously important but the actors play an equally significant role.
 
 Ankush was last seen in ‘Bolo Dugga Maiki’ but failed to impress the audience. Apart from ‘D 4 Dance’, he will also reportedly be seen in a   movie as the lead.
