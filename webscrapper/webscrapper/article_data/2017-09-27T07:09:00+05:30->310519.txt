Ghaziabad: A 75-year-old   was allegedly found murdered outside his Maliwara-based garment shop in Ghaziabad on Monday night. 

 Police suspect the role of a worker, who is currently missing.
 
 Cops said the body of Rajender Agarwal was found on the stairs — leading to a first-floor room where he lived alone — outside his shop on the ground floor late on Monday night. Preliminary probe suggests he was hit on the head with a blunt object which led to his death on the spot. 
 
 “My father used to come to my place everyday to have dinner and then go back to the shop. When he didn’t come till 10.30pm, we went looking for him at the shop and found him lying unconscious on the stairs. There was an injury mark on the back of his head,” said his daughter Soniya, who lives nearby. 
 
 DSP Aatish Kumar Singh said Agarwal had hired a man to replace his regular  , who had gone on leave a few days ago. “The replacement had worked with him seven years ago. Since he is missing, we suspect that he might have committed the crime,” said Singh. However, the motive behind the murder was not immediately clear. 
 
 Police are trying to find out if anything is missing from the shop.
 
 “We have put his (servant’s) phone on surveillance and his last   has been traced to Pauri in  . A team has been dispatched to nab the accused” added the DSP.
 
 An FIR has been filed and the body has been sent for the post-mortem.
 
 There is a tension in the area which is largely inhabited by the trader community. “I have known him for many years and I don’t know how anyone could have killed him in such. He was old and was not keeping well for some time,” said Radhey Shayam, a trader.
