Vadodara: Perturbed by its land being shown in the master plan prepared by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) for station area development, M S University on Monday wrote a letter to the civic body stating that approval of its syndicate body is required before it shows any piece of university land in the master plan.  It is since last month that the VMC and MSU are engaged in a bitter battle over the prime land parcel inside the compound wall of MSU opposite Experimental School which according to the civic body falls within “road line” – a claim which MSU has firmly rejected.  The fresh missive from MSU comes at a time when the corporation has publicized its master plan which suggests that the civic body wants to go ahead with landscaping on the land inside the university’s compound wall.  While appreciating VMC’s efforts for development of station area and urban transportation hub, MSU’s letter states “it would have been appropriate if the consent or approval of university syndicate would have been taken on the proposed landscape or greenery plan in place of the existing paved parking area within university campus for the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Education and Psychology and Experimental School.” Further, the letter signed by university engineer N K Ojha states that “university syndicate is the only authority to give any approval for use or surrender of any land of university to any institution, organisation or person.”  With regards to the ornamental gate in front of Faculty of Science which the civic body has proposed to construct as part of the master plan, the university has stated that the idea was mooted way back in 2005.  “It is extremely pleasing to learn that VMC could get this piece of land free of cost from collector office within no time!” the letter states. MSU has shown its readiness to construct the gate but has also clarified that the corporation should not seek anything in exchange.
