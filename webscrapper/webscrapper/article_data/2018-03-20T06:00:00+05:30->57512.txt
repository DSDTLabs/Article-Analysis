Hyderabadis took a step back in time and dressed up for a retro-themed costume party at a plush hotel in the city on Saturday. Themed ‘The Golden Oldies’, the annual costume party of the   saw guests turn up in monochromes, polka dots, plaids and florals, edgy drapes, spunky ruffles and flared bottoms taking cues from the trends of the 40s to the 80s. While the live band infused some energy with some retro tunes, the ladies got into an impromptu jig and posed for the shutterbugs as they snapped away. The underlying cause at the heart of the event, however, was a noble one. It was a fundraiser for children whose families cannot afford treatment. And Hyderabadis loosened their purse strings happily!
