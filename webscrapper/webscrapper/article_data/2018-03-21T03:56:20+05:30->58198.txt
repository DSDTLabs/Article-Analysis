RAIPUR: Former CM   on Tuesday indicated that his   would be part of the proposed federal front. “With strong signs of BJP going down in 2019 and   already in the dumps, the only other alternative is for other parties to get together to form a national government,” Jogi said. 

 
 Talking to TOI a day after Bengal CM   and her Telangana counterpart K Chandrasekhar Rao pitched for a non-BJP, non-Congress Federal Front, Jogi said he has spoken to Rao and expressed willingness to be part of a third-front like formation at the national level. When pointed out that such coalitions had failed to offer stability in the past, the former CM said: “It may be true. I don’t deny that. But now things have evolved in such a manner that this is bound to happen. We will have to face the possibility of the government not lasting its full term. If there is a strong leader, who can keep the flock together, like  , who in his time took everyone together...” 
 
 Every party in the front will collectively choose a leader with a national image to lead the coalition, he felt. “Though KCR has taken the initiative, I think Mamata Banerjee is a dynamic leader and there are a couple of other leaders, like AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu as well,” he said. Jogi said his party’s top priority and focus is on the assembly polls in Chhattisgarh. “We will think about 2019 only after the assembly polls,” he said.
