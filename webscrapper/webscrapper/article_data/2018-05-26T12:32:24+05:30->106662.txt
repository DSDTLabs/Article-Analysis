Infection can also occur by eating fruits which are partly eaten by infected bats. Human to human infection can occur through direct contact with body fluids or by droplet infection.
 
 Kumar said that the initial presentation is non-specific, characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting. Neck rigidity and photophobia can occur. The disease progresses rapidly, with deterioration in consciousness leading to coma within five to seven days.
