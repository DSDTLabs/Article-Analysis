NEW DELHI: Reacting to reports of an Indian origin man being assaulted and racially abused in Auckland on Monday, the   government soundly condemned the attack and said the incident was not indicative of the country's attitude towards foreigners.

 "The comments reported do not reflect the views of the vast majority of New Zealanders," Jessep added.

 Singh did not engage with the man but began recording his racist rant and streamed the video on  .
 
 "It really shocked me and after he [left], I was really shaken... The first thing in my mind was that he might hurt me with some weapon," Singh said about his attacker.
 
 The incident comes close on the heels of recent incidents of apparent hate crimes against Indians in the US.
