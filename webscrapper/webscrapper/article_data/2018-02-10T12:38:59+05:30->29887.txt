LUCKNOW: Will BSP chief   take a plunge in the bypoll battle and contest from Gorakhpur or Phulpur, the parliamentary seats vacated by CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively?

 While there is no official wordonBSPsupremo’splanto contest either of the two seats, political experts see in it a chance for Mayawati to raise the sagging morale of her party cadre following electoral reverses in 2014   elections, when her party drew a blank, and then in 2017 UP polls when BSP tally fell to its lowest.
 
 Political circles have been abuzz since last August about Mayawati planning to contest from Phulpur. The speculation gained momentum when she resigned from   in July, in protest for not being allowed to speak on Saharanpur dalit atrocities.
 
 Some analysts believe that Mayawati may not contest herself and instead field a candidate from Phulpur which has dalits and Most Backward Caste (MBCs) in considerable numbers. The party even won the seat when when its candidate Kapilmuni Karwariya triumphed in 2009 Lok Sabha elections. Karwariya, a Brahmin, however, lost in 2014 and switched to BJP.
 
 Party sources say that Mayawati is averse to contesting by-elections since she did not field any candidate in   assembly bypoll.
 
 A senior BSP leader said that Mayawati will not take chance to contest by-election for a seat whose tenure spans for less than a year. Moreover, any defeat now will reflect badly on her party’s prospects in 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as in alliance talks.
