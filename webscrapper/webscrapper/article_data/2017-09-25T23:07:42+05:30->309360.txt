VARANASI: Police detained social activist   under Section 151 of IPC on Monday, and later released on condition that she would have to leave the district immediately.

 Setalvad accused the local administration of harassing her unnecessarily and forcing her to leave the district. She arrived here on Monday to attend a programme at Rajghat. But she was taken to the Police Line from the   airport, and later released on condition that she would leave Varanasi.
 
 
 
 
 “I have been facing an awkward situtation since I landed at the airport at 9:30am. The police took me to the Police Line and detained me for reasons best known to them. Later, I was allowed into the circuit house under the condition that I would have to leave Varanasi immediately,” she told TOI, adding, “I am unable to understand why the local administration is behaving like this. I was repeatedly told by the officials that they had orders from the higher authorities to send me back from Varanasi. They failed to give me any specific reason for my detention. Can I not move freely?” asked Setalvad, adding that the officials probably feared that she would go to meet the agitating BHU girls.
 
 “I made it clear to them that I am not here to go to BHU, but to attend a programme that was scheduled a month ago. Yet they forced me to leave Varanasi,” she said, adding that she was leaving for   to attend another programme scheduled for Tuesday. Cantonment inspector  , when contacted, said Setalvad was detained fearing breach of peace. She was asked to leave for Jaunpur. She arrived here to participate in the concluding session of a three-day Yuva Samta Samwad Shivir organised by   at Rajghat.
