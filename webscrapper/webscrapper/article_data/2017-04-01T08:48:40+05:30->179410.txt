CHENNAI: With the   hardly 10 days away,   are optimizing their resources for their campaigns. While the   (Amma) and DMK are dependent on ministers and MLAs, the AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi Amma) is roping in small   to   for its candidate E Madhusudhanan. 

 DMK has asked all its MLAs to campaign for its candidate Maruthu Ganesh. Every day, one MLA accompanies Ganesh during campaigns in the morning and evening. For AIADMK-Amma candidate TTV Dhinakaran, ministers and MLAs campaign for him every day. Party releases give names and mobile numbers of the MLA or minister who is incharge of the campaign. 
 
 But for O Panneerselvam group, cadres of smaller parties like Tamil Maanila Katchi led by former Madras high court advocates association chief R C Paul Kanagaraj and Muvendar Munnani Kazhagam led by Sethuraman are campaigning in R K Nagar. The OPS group also has appointed three advocates for every ward to monitor activities of other parties and complain to Election Commission in the case of any violation or irregulairty. 
 
 With only 11 MLAs and 12 MPs supporting the OPS-led AIADMK-Puratchi Thalaivi Amma group, they don't have enough leaders to campaign for Madhusudhanan. "We have the support of smaller parties and volunteers. On Friday morning, we had a meeting of cadres from the Tamil Maanila Katchi and some of our star speakers at R K Nagar," said a senior leader of the group. Senior leaders brief them on the issues to be highlighted during the campaign. The OPS group is also handicapped without a party office. "Though many places were chosen within the constituency for our election office, either the owners declined to let it out on rent or under duress from the rival faction denied us the space. Finally we chose to have the office near our candidate's house and this was opened on Thursday by Panneerserlvam himself," said the leader.
