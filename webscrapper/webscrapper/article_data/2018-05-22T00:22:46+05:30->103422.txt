Salem: State animal husbandry minister Udumalai K Radhakrishnan said his department has taken all steps to issue cattle to the beneficiaries under the free cattle scheme at the earliest. “The beneficiaries will rear the cattle using American technology,” he said.

 Radhakrishnan inaugurated a jallikattu event at Koodamalai near Attur on Monday morning. 
 
 Speaking to reporters after the inauguration, the minister said the cattle reared as per Indian methods will have minimal protein and other vitamins. 
 
 “When the cattle are reared as per American technology, they will have better health condition,” he said. 
 
 Radhakrishnan added that fodder also will be cultivated with high minerals so that the cattle would give us rich protein contained milk.
 
 Explaining about the memorandum of understanding inked with Oklahoma University in the US, Radhakrishnan said, “The university will help us in setting up highly technical and latest pens to rear goats and sheep,” he said.
 
 He also listed that about 8.82 lakh beneficiaries were issued goats and 80,000 beneficiaries were given milch cows under the free cattle scheme across the state.
 
 Radhakrishnan assured that the number of seats will be increased in veterinary medical colleges if the demand increases. “Currently, 320 students are pursuing in four veterinary medical colleges in the district,” he said.
