Surat: A member of the managing committee has served legal notice to the president of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI), B S Agarwal for causing huge financial loss by letting out the convention centre to a private entertainment firm for organizing the Manhar Udhas event on Friday.

 The SGCCI had organised the Manhar Udhas event along with the private entertainment agency on March 18. The show drew lots of criticism from within the SGCCI.
 
 Nitin Bharuch, member of SGCCIâ€™s managing committee, stated in the legal notice that the SGCCI president had proposed in the general meeting that the chamber will be spending for light and sound and sitting arrangements at the hall and that rest all expenses will be borne by the entertainment firm. The event was organised only for the SGCCI members and not for the general public.
