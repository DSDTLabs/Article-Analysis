Actress   says she loves her  . 

  
  
 The 49-year-old actress, who shares an adopted son and daughter with ex-husband  , and two biological daughters with her current husband  , said she enjoys the challenges of motherhood.
 
 "There is just the joy of being a mother; whether it's being an adoptive, biological, or foster mother, or a mother figure. Keith's always saying I'm so maternal. I like that. I am the eldest child in my family and so a lot of times the eldest child wants to take care of everybody. 
 
 "But I have had to learn that I can't take care of everybody. But a strong pull in my life is my maternal force and I love it. I think when you reach a certain age you go, 'I wish I had more children'," Kidman said.
