GURUGRAM: A 68-year-old man has been booked for allegedly holding his wife and daughter captive and assaulting them at their   residence. 

 An   was registered after the 21-year-old daughter managed to flee from her home and landed at the women’s police station on Sunday evening in bare feet.
 
 The girl, with minor scratches and swollen eyes, alleged her father kicked, punched and slapped her, and pulled her hair repeatedly throughout the day on Sunday. She further alleged that her father had been regularly abusing and thrashing her mother too. 
 
 “My father beat us brutally and did not allow us to step out of the home. He pulled my hair at least 20 times since Sunday morning and kicked me in the abdomen. He also confiscated my phone when I tried to call the police. Finally, I managed to run out of the house, without slippers and proper clothes. We have had enough… want strict action against him,” the girl told the police. 
 
 “My mother is being thrashed and treated like a prisoner since their marriage in 1981. Now, even I am facing the same fate. We both have swollen eyes,” she added.
 
 The girl was sent to the Civil Hospital for medical examinations soon after she approached the women’s police station around 7pm on Sunday. Based on the complaint, a case was filed against the father under sections 323 (causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC at Sector 50 police station (as per the jurisdiction).
 
 “We have registered the case and are investigating the matter. The accused will be arrested soon,” said inspector Surender Phogat, SHO, Sector 50 police station. After the medical examination, the girl has been handed over to her mother and maternal uncle, Phogat added.
