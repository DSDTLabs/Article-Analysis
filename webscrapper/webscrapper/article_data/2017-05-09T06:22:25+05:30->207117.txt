AHMEDABAD:   (HC) has held that the telecommunication service providers are liable to pay property tax for erection of towers in rural areas as well.

 The HC has turned down petitions filed by ATC Telecom Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and Indus Towers Ltd, demanding that the levying of property tax on mobile towers in village panchayat limits is unconstitutional and they challenge provisions of the law. The companies had moved the HC after certain village panchayat bodies in   had issued notice and bills to them to pay property tax for the towers they had installed in panchayat limits.
 
 The HC put an end to the issue by saying that a mobile tower was considered a building and hence property tax was liable to be paid. The HC also noticed that the telecom companies had entered into a second round of litigation to avoid payment of tax after they lost a similar case with regard to levying of property tax in the city areas under the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act.
 
 The companies challenged the constitutional validity of section 200(1) of the Gujarat Panchayat Act on the ground that it was unconstitutional and unenforceable as being inconsistent with Article 243H and 265 of the Constitution.
 
 A month ago, the HC upheld levying of property tax on IBS/boosters of mobile telecom companies. While   had questioned Rajkot Municipal Corporation’s demand of Rs 80 crore towards property tax,   had approached the HC against Surat civic body’s notice to the company to pay property tax for such IBS/boosters.
