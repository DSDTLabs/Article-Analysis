 The opposition has slammed the government for the frequent suicide attempts at the state government’s administrative headquarters. Before Raote, there were two suicide attempts in a week—one of them two days ago—and six in four months. “Mantralaya has become a suicide point. This just shows that the local level administration is failing to address problems of the public and they are forced to come to Mantralaya and take the extreme step out of frustration,” said NCP leader.
 
 
 Originally a resident of Chembur, Raote was serving life term in Paithan open jail since 2014 and was out on furlough. He was to report to jail on Thursday, but landed up at Mantralaya. Raote had been convicted for the murder of his sister-in-law at her Kalwa home in 2003. Following the case, his wife divorced him and he fell out with his parents too.
