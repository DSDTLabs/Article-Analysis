Hyderabad/Bengaluru: Though disappointed at not finding even a mention in finance minister Arun Jaitley’s nearly two-hour-long budget speech, the   sector is hopeful of a trickle-down effect of the government’s thrust on healthcare with the universal health insurance for the country’s masses as well as measures like PMRF and reduction in corporate tax for MSMEs.

 “Though there is nothing specific for the sector, I think the universal health insurance was the highlight. It is an amazing budgetary announcement that intends to cover half of the population,” said Biocon Ltd CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.
 
 Another thing lifting the spirits of this niche sector is the decision to slash corporate tax to 25% for companies with turnover of up to Rs 250 crore. “With nearly 98% of biotech companies falling in the sub-Rs 250 crore revenue bracket, the tax reduction will definitely bring significant benefits, leaving them with more money to plough back into business and R&D,” said PM Murali, president, Association of Biotech Led Enterprises (ABLE).
 
 Bharat Biotech International Ltd vice-president (finance) T Srinivas, while ruing the lack of incentive for innovation through a hike in weighted deduction on R&D expenditure from 150% to 200%, which was a key demand of the R&D intensive sector, said the emphasis on preventive healthcare can prove beneficial for vaccine makers.
