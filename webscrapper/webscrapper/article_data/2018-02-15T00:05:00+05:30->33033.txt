CHENNAI: By not conducting the civic polls due since October 2016, the   government may have lost an opportunity to capitalise on the sympathy wave following J Jayalalithaa’s death and strengthen its presence at the local level.

 Instead of galvanising Jayalalithaa’s support base, the AIADMK appeared confused and blamed the DMK for the delay. The opposition party had filed several cases in the Madras high court on the local body elections. The government also kept changing the way a mayor would be elected. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states in the country which does not have local bodies due to which it does not get revenue from the Centre under the Panchayat Act.
 
 “Tamil Nadu gets a maximum of Rs 4,000cr annually and this is distributed to 12 corporations, 124 municipalities, 528 town panchayats and 12,528 panchayats. Based on the population and other criteria, the amount will be distributed,” said a senior official.
 
 “We were ready to hold local body elections in October 2016 and had announced a list of candidates. But the DMK kept moving court. Since the case is pending, we could not hold the election,” said senior AIADMK leader K P Munusamy.
 
 But DMK said the AIADMK was not ready to hold an election as per the Panchayat Act. “We wanted the election to be held as per the Act. Every 10 years, there must be delimitation of wards across Tamil Nadu. But the state election commission did not do it. Only after we went to the court it was announced. Generally, delimitations must start one year before the election,” said DMK spokesperson T K S Elangovan. He said the AIADMK was afraid to face the people.
 
 Independent analysts said since there was no towering leader in the AIADMK, the party was delaying the polls. “After Jayalalithaa, there is no charismatic leader in the AIADMK. If elections are held today, the party will lose badly,” said political analyst Tamilaruvi Manian.
