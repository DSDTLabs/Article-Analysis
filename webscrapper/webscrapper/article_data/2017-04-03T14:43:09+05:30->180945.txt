Mirror (March 31) had reported that after the release of her last film, 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', 
  took off to London to blow off some steam with her gal pals before she kicks off work on  's 
  starrer 'Dragon'. Now, her Badri, 
 , seems to have taken a cue out of her book of personal well being by putting a day-long break from his hectic schedule to party with friends at a farmhouse near Pavana Lake.

  
  
 The 29-year-old actor took to social media to post pictures of an expansive pool on the property, picturesquely tucked in the midst of mountains with an Irish Setter dog strolling around. It sure must have been a welcome break for the actor who, after the success of the Shashank Khaitan-directed romcom, is now bracing up to dive into father  's 'Judwaa 2', which kicks off April 10 in London.
