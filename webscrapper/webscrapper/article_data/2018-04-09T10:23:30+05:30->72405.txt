HYDERABAD : In the last three months, 210 cases of dengue have been reported in   including 70 from Hyderabad. Currently, the worst affected of all districts remain   and Sangareddy, according to the state health department records.

 Experts suggest that the rain over the last two weeks may have led to cases spiralling. On Saturday alone, four new cases of dengue and malaria each were reported as per official records of the state health department. Private hospitals too continue to report dengue cases. “We are seeing one or two dengue cases every few days. Although the numbers are not alarming right now, with more rains, we will need to watch out,” said Dr  , consultant general physician, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda.
 
 
 While the spread of dengue usually starts in July-August and subsides by end of December, this year many cases have been reported even in April. In addition to dengue, many malaria cases too have been reported. So far this year, 272 cases of malaria have been reported from across the state, of which 126 were from the city alone.
 
 Apart from areas where badly maintained roads result in frequent water-logging, areas such as Kukatpally, Nacharam, Rajendranagar, Saroornagar, Towlichowli and   suffer from the mosquito menace. Being located close to water bodies and tanks, these areas face a persistent problem through the year.
 
 Speaking about the problem these areas face, V  , chief entomologist, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), said, “These mosquitoes are not disease-causing mosquitoes. However, we are taking steps like removing water hyacinth. Hyacinth has been removed from 20 tanks and today we are removing the hyacinth from seven more tanks. Herbicide and pyrethrin are being sprayed after removing water hyacinth. Additional fogging is being taken up in the areas close to tanks.”
