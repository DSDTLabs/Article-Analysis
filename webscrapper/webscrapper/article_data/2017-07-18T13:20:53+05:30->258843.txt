English rock band   gave  ' mother 'a few thousand dollars' to help them rebuild their lives following the tragic death of her father. 

 The 48-year-old actress was just seven years old when her dad Peter Watts - a sound engineer for the English rock band - passed away and she said she owes a lot to the group because they helped them in getting her family back on track.
 
  
  
 "When he died, my dad hadn't saved money, and I guess my mum didn't have any. So they, the band, very kindly ... 'Trust fund' doesn't sound right at all."
 
 "I think they gave my mum a few thousand dollars to help get things under way. A lump sum, to help. It was kind that they did that," Watts said.
