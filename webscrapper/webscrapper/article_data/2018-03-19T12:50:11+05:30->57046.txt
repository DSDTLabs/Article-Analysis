Director Vikramaditya Motwane’s ‘Lootera’ boasted of fine performances from its protagonists   and   but things could have been very different. When   read the film's script for the very first time, he wasn't sure if he could pull off the part. In fact, he even turned down the offer right away. It was on the director's insistence that Ranveer agreed to have another session of script reading. And as soon as   was done telling the film's story to him, Ranveer was greatly impressed by it and found himself confident enough to get into the skin of the character.
