Yet another round of reports about paper leaks has caused concern among students in the  . With both   and the state council board exams going on, such reports have posed serious questions about the sanctity and validity of our public examination system. 

 While no exams have been cancelled and no reports substantiated, the reports did lead to a great deal of concern among students and guardians. Authorities conducting these examinations have taken precautions to plug loopholes and prevent such leaks. Still, such incidents recur.
 
 A possible solution is to keep multiple sets - three to a set is the norm for question papers - and reissue the next set if one is compromised. This is a tried-and-tested method, successfully used in engineering and medical entrance tests.
 
 Another area of concern is the difficulty level of questions for subjects like physics, maths, accountancy and economics, among others. While checks and balances are supposedly in place to bring in a certain amount of moderation, there are still complaints of a lack of balance in the difficulty level. The average examinee's confidence takes a big hit, leading to disenchantment with the subject.
 
 In this context, those who frame the questions could very well abide by the golden rule of easy, moderately difficult and challenging with a corresponding distribution at 40+40+20 in the question paper set, to allow every student to get a shot at clearing the paper, and also at excelling in it if merit and preparation permits.
