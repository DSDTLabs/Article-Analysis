 A reflection of my soul. 

 
  Fun and confident. 
 
 
 Unapologetic, in your face and edgy. I love vintage. 
 
 
  A good workout and its results. 
 
 
 For me, it’s important to have clothes that fit me well. I dislike the idea of being told stuff like – a   or LBD is a must-have. The point of fashion is to celebrate individuality and not be clones of each other. 
 
 
  My debit card, a perfume and a lip balm. 
 
 
 My wedding ring. It’s special and stunning. 
 
 
  A sexy short dress that stands out. 
 
 
  A pencil skirt with a buttoned shirt with puffed sleeves. Complete with heels. 
 
 
 A pair of shorts, crop top, jacket and sneakers. 
 
 
  A well-fitted pair of   with a fitted blouse or bodysuit. Sleek hair and pumps to finish the look. 
 
 
 Buy clothes to fit your body not the other way around. Know your shape before you shop. 
 
 
 : Add heels to an outfit.
 
  
 Shoes. I have over a 100 pairs of designer shoes. 
 
 
 Euphoria by Calvin Klein – it’s very seductive! 
 
 
 White.
 
 
 Milan. The display at the stores there is pure magic. 
 
 
 I have committed many, but all I can do is look back and laugh at my guts now. I still love animal prints though!
 
 
 
 Everything vintage. I love the 50s and 60s – dresses that flaunt an hourglass figure work best for me.
