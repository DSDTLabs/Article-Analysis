NAINITAL: Thirty-year-old  ,  , who works as an   in a degree college in Bageshwar, called off her wedding with Surendra Singh, who is a research scholar in Dehradun, when the latter's family demanded Rs 10 lakh in dowry. She also registered a case against her would-be spouse. The wedding was scheduled to take place on Wednesday. Police said a case under section 3 (penalty for giving or taking dowry) and 4 (penalty for demanding dowry) of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, and section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the would-be groom and his family members. 

  Elba, who teaches English Literature, told TOI, "We came in contact with each other through a matrimonial service run by a common acquaintance in Dehradun. 
 
 Lately, Surendra Singh, who is also a Christian, started acting weird and started asking me objectionable questions. 
 
 He would often use abusive language for me and my family. Then suddenly, his mother asked us to keep Rs 10 lakh ready on the day of the marriage." 
 
  According to Elba's family members, preparations were almost complete and the marriage was to be solemnized at the family's rented accommodation in Damwadunga area of Haldwani city. A deeply religious person, Elba and her family are into philanthropic activities and are raising 10 orphan children at their house. "The   came as a shocker to us, but also a relief in the long run that they showed their true colours," Elba added.
 
  The family of the accused, however, has denied the charges and maintained that they are being unnecessarily harassed. "Elba would provoke my brother and record the conversation when he would become aggressive," said Arun Kumar, Surendra's brother.
