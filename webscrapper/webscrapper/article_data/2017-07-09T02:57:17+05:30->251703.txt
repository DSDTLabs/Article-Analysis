NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has turned down Maharashtra Congress' demand to screen  's forthcoming film 'Indu Sarkar'- a film based on the 1975 Emergency period in India - exclusively for the   ahead of the its release. 

  CBFC chief   has said the board does not have ownership rights to films and that only the producer or director can decide who to screen the film for, ahead of its formal release. He also said CBFC routinely received letters from individuals and organisations asking for the CBFC to deny certificates to films and that CBFC was in no way obliged to respond to such demands 
 
  Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam had written to director Madhur Bhandarkar and subsequently to the CBFC chief, demanding that the film be shown to Congress members before its release. The party has claimed that the film depicts   in a poor light and is meant to run down her contribution to the country at a time when the party is organising year-long birth centenary celebrations in memory of the former PM. 
 
  Director Madhur Bhandarkar, who has already refused to screen the film for "anyone", especially a political party, before its release, has also said the film is not based on any individual and that it merely uses the Emergency period as a backdrop. Dismissing the Congress' request, Bhandarkar said the decision to screen the film for someone will be his decision. "I would tell Congress people to come and watch the film in theatres before making such comments," Bhandarkar said. Indu Sarkar is scheduled to release on July 28.
