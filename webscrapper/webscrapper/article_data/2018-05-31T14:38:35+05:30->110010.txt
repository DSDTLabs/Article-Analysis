INDORE: To ensure that the information of   ( ) aspirants is not misused and those who scored less don’t feel depressed about the fact that their result is made public this year the test   will be password protected.

 
 There have been instances when aspirants’ information was misused by miscreants. Also, some students get more depressed when their friends see their low grades, CET chairman Dr Anil Kumar said.
 
 “To overcome these issues, we have decided to make the results password protected. The password will remain the same that they had used during their exam. In case, if they have forgotten their password there is an option to get it. They can click on that icon and get the password on their registered mobile number,” he said.
 
 Speaking about two-member committee that was set to resolve three complaints that were received, Kumar said, parents of two students had alleged that their ward was not permitted to write the paper, although the reporting time was 8 am, after probe it was found that the students had reached the venue after 9:40 am and till 9:40 am all the students were permitted inside.
 
 “The observers were permitting even those students who had come to the centre without a photo identity after taking an undertaking letter from them. The student who had filled the handicapped box by mistake, we will consider his result only on the basis of the first 90 minutes,” said Kumar. The   are expected to announced on Thursday.
