: I am not able to trust my husband as I caught him cheating twice. And our marriage is just 3 months old. He has always liked talking to other girls and now I donâ€™t think he has a good character. What should I do? This is stressing me out! - 
 

 
 : The solution is pretty simple and straightforward. There are very limited options available and that depends entirely on how you look at it. You need to put yourself first and prioritize your happiness. 
 
 Talk to him directly, without judging him. If you have any evidence regarding his cheating, then confront him. And as it is just 3 months of marriage, the other option (not very recommended) is to be patient, talk about why he does it and have the heart to forgive him this one time, which totally depends on your tolerance.
 
 However, it is better to involve a neutral third person and take a firm decision. And stand by whatever decision is taken, as you do not deserve to be upset and sad.
