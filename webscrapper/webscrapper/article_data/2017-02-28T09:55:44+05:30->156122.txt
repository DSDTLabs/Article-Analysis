HYDERABAD: After successfully operating 102 services for pregnant women round-the-clock in tribal areas of Telangana, health department is planning to introduce the 'Amma Vodi' (mother's lap) express services in Hyderabad soon.

 Currently, efforts are on to tie up with   (EMRI), which runs 108 ambulances. Services will be managed through a centralised 24x7 call centre with a universal 102 tollfree number. On an average, 30 minutes will be reserved as response time for ambulances to reach those in distress.
 
 At a recent meeting with   (DMHO), instructions were given to identify pregnant women. Ambulances will carry them to hospital and track their delivery status. The details will be maintained by a separate desk being set up for this in EMRI.
 
 The institute has about 23 ambulances in the city for 108 service, some of the vehicles will be allotted on priority basis to attend calls for deliveries.
 
 Also, health department is preparing a software to track details of pregnant women, including their last menstrual period (LMP). Once pregnant women approach a primary health care centre (PHC) or any other district hospital, staff at referral hospitals will be alerted. These measures will help reduce maternal mortality rate and ensure safe delivery.
 
 Currently , maternal mortality rate (MMR) is 92 in Telangana, as against the national av erage of 167. Telangana already stands the fourth in the country with lowest   after Kerala (66), Tamil Nadu (90) and Maharashtra (87).
 
 MMR is highest in Adilabad with 152 as against state average of 92. The 102 services are already available in tribal pockets of the district. MMR in 7 of10 districts (of earlier 13 districts) was below the state average, indicating consistent efforts by officials in bringing down MMR across the state. In Hyderabad, MMR is 71, which is also less than state average.
