HYDERABAD: Actor Tanish Alladi on Monday appeared before prohibition and excise department's Special Investigation Team (SIT) for his alleged links with drug peddlers. Tanish, who was grilled for four hours, reportedly told the SIT sleuths that he neither consumed drugs or knew any peddler. 

 Tanish reached the Special Investigation Team office at Abkari Bhavan around 10am. He was reportedly questioned about whether he had ever met any of the arrested drug peddlers or if he had ever taken drugs from any of the already-questioned Tollywood personalities. Tanish, who had been a child actor, completely denied doing drugs ever. At 2.30pm, Tanish left the Special Investigation Team office and spoke to the media before leaving. He said his family had been disturbed after seeing his name crop up in the drug case. 
 
 Apart from Tanish, two more youngsters, both students, appeared before the SIT on Monday. Tanish's blood samples were not taken by the SIT officials as they felt it was not required at this point of time. 
 
 When the drug scandal broke out first, Tanish talking to media personnel had volunteered to give blood samples and face questioning, if need be. At that time he was yet to receive the SIT notice. 
 
 He is among the few persons who received the notices late. Till now, 10 Tollywood personalities have been questioned for their alleged links to drug peddlers.
