Thiruvananthapuram: The heritage pathway laying works in the precincts of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple as part of the National   scheme for development of spiritual and heritage circuits is set to begin on Thursday after a ritual.

  Of the total project cost of Rs 78.55 crore earmarked by the Central government for this temple, Rs 15 crore has been released. 
 
 Temple administrative committee chairperson K Haripal said that the Centre has set aside around Rs 99.44 crore under the National Swadesh Darshan scheme to develop spiritual and pilgrim centres including Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Sabarimala and Aranmula temple. The project is proposed to be completed in three years, he said.
 
 Though the work was planned to begin earlier, cable wires and electricity overhead lines were found in the temple vicinity. These need to be placed underground prior to the works. “We have sought the support of the state electricity board and BSNL to ensure that the cables and electricity wires are placed underground. Heritage road and pathway around the temple with stone tiles and pebbles is planned. The work is entrusted with Nirmithi Kendra and Housing Board,” said temple executive officer V Ratheesan. The Nambi Madam, the residence of the Nambi priests and pathway will be restored, he said. The cleansing and restoration works of Padmatheertham pond as part of the project has also begun, he said.
 
 Though it was indicated earlier that the Centre had released Rs 30 crore as the first instalment for the project, the temple officials indicate that they have received only Rs 15 crore. “As of now, we have received Rs 15.71 crore for the works at Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple and another Rs 20 crore is expected to be released soon,” said temple senior finance officer Udayabhanu Kandeth.
