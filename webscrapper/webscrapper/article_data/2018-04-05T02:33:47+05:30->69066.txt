NEW DELHI: The AAP government has in its white paper claimed that the   exercises a “pocket veto” as he is able to delay or derail any proposal of the elected government by raising minor and often irrelevant concerns. 

 
  
  
 
 The government says the LG doesn’t express any substantive difference of opinion or refer matters to the President; what he does is he “often raises objections, asks for clarifications or refers matters to central government departments”. 
 
 The paper shows the tricky legal position of Delhi, which is not a full state but has a special status as a Union territory with a legislature. It quotes Article 239AA (4) of the Constitution, which lays out the role of LG in the Delhi government, to point out that in case of a substantive difference of opinion with the council of ministers, the LG may refer the matter to the President. And while referring the matter, he may add that a matter may be urgent. 
 
 As regards referring issues back to specific departments like law and finance by the LG, the government has said when a decision is taken by the cabinet, it is final. It is the prerogative of the cabinet to consult the departments before meeting. As example, the government has referred to how approvals work in the Centre. “When the Prime Minister brought in the policy of demonetisation, the views of the secretaries of the relevant departments were taken only in the Cabinet meeting. Therefore, when a proposal is sent back to any of those departments whose views have already been taken on board by the cabinet, then the message is clear – that this proposal of the elected government needs to be delayed or derailed,” the   says. 
 
 In a section on ‘rejection on a flimsy ground’, it is said that the revision of minimum wages was not approved since the LG didn’t approve the advisory committee. LG reconstituted the committee that gave the same proposal but delayed it overall by 192 days.
