THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution demanding the   to arrest the fall in rubber prices and retain   offices in the state. The resolution comes in the wake of repeated demands by the opposition to fix the support price for rubber at Rs 200 per kg and the Centre's decision to close down the regional offices of the Rubber Board. 

 The resolution presented by agriculture minister   urged the Centre to make use of clauses in WTO and other   treaties to increase duty on imported rubber and to include the crop in the 'livelihood security box', as it is the livelihood of farmers in Kerala.
 
 Inclusion of rubber in the 'negative list' of RCEP, a free trade agreement between ASEAN countries, is another demand.
 
 "Kerala, being the country's largest rubber producer, the Rubber Board headquarters should not be shifted to any other state. The decision to close down regional offices should also be withdrawn," it said. The resolution pointed out that a central aid was required to fix the support price at Rs 200.
