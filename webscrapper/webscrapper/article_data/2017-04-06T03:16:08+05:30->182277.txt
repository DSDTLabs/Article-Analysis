GHAZIABAD: A 26-year-old youth was   to death after the car he was driving hit an electric pole and caught fire in Shalimar Garden area in the wee hours of Wednesday. 

 The victim, Jaif Khan, who worked as cabin crew in an airline company, was on his way to a gym when the accident took place. It was not until afternoon that his identity could be ascertained as the body was charred beyond recognition.
 
 According to police, the car, a   Verna, was reportedly being driven on the wrong side near Lohia Park at a high speed when it rammed an electric pole and overturned. “Such was the impact of the collision that half of the pole fell on the car and it immediately caught fire,” said Raj Kumar, chowki in charge of Shalimar Garden who was the first to reach the spot. “I had to call a fire tender which reached the spot shortly but by that time the car was gutted and the driver charred to death,” said Raj Kumar.
 
 Till noon, the victim’s identity could not be ascertained though the car was registered at an address in Preet Vihar in Delhi. 
 
 “On the basis of the registration number, we then contacted the showroom from where the car was bought and from there we got the address of a service centre at Mathura Road. From there we got the Shalimar Garden address and his relatives were informed,” said Raj Kumar.
 
 According to police, a leakage in the fuel tank following the collision could have started the fire. “The driver might have lost his consciousness due to the impact. So when the fire started, it was no way he could have got out of the car that was already on fire presumably due to leak in fuel tank,” said Abdul Abbas Hussain, fire officer, Sahibabad.
