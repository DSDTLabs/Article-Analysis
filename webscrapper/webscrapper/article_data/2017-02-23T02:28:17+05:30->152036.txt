NEW  : Having received over 10,000 applications for the forthcoming municipal elections,   has seen stiff competition among aspirants with as many as 30 people vying for a ticket in some wards. 

 MLAs coordinating applications say scores of posters of various ticket-seekers have come up across the city, with some even playing petty games such as sticking their bills over those of others. The party hopes to announce the majority of its   by March 11. 
 
 In Laxmi Nagar, one applicant posted his paster on top of another’s, while a third applicant posted his on top of the second. “Thankfully for the party, all posters are following the theme given out by the party for corporation campaigning, which is ‘MCD mein jhadu chalao, Dilli se gandagi bhagao’. Most of the posters are carrying CM Arvind Kejriwal’s photo, that of the local MLA and the applicant’s picture. Some applicants are very cleverly pasting their posters on top of another applicant’s in such a way that the other’s face is hidden,” said a party source.
 
 In same ward, sources said, ticket hopefuls of other parties who had put up their posters earlier pasted their wives’ photos on top of others after it was declared a woman’s seat. 
 
 This trend has been seen at other constituencies as well. In places like Janakpuri, Sangam Vihar, and Najafgarh, posters of AAP ticket hopefuls have dotted the roads and busy markets. “In a couple of wards in Janakpuri, there are as many as 15-25 applicants each. All are trying to be visible. After a ward was declared reserved, some male aspirants applied in other wards. About five will be shortlisted and the final candidate selection will be done by the parliamentary affairs committee,” said a party source. 
 
 Another party member, however, said the stiff competition was making work easier. “Applicants are carrying out background checks on their competitors and giving us reports. Of course, we have to be careful that no fake complaints are submitted,” he said.
