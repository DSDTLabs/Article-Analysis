AHMEDABAD: With the   coming to an end on Friday, the spill-over traffic continued to be the headache for the cops and commuters alike on   and roads connecting Ashram Road for the fourth consecutive day. 

  Bumper-to-bumper traffic was observed during peak hours especially in the evening.
 
 Citizens also complained of absence of traffic police officials at many of the major city junctions on Friday morning. Senior city police officials could not be contacted.
 
 “For the past four days, it has been a routine for us to be in traffic for over 30 minutes just to cross the road from Income Tax crossroads to  , and Friday was no different. I’ve stopped taking the Riverfront road especially in the evenings between Ellisbridge and Paldi as the two events are attracting a huge number of visitors,” said Malay Mehta, a resident of Paldi, who was in the jam near Ellisbridge.
 
 With the   bandobast finally over on Friday, the cops expect the traffic to return to normalcy post Uttarayan festivities. 
 
 “Presence of a policeman at crossroads makes a lot of difference. I encountered a number of jams, especially at the crossroads in western city parts, as the citizens have poor traffic sense. Nobody was ready to budge and smaller vehicles tried to even take on footpaths,” said  , a resident of Anandnagar.
