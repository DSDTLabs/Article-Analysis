RANCHI: India’s central   forces are to be trained for combatting cyber terrorism and counter insurgency operations in coming days, Union home minister   Singh hinted on Sunday.

 Singh, who inaugurated the eastern sector headquarter of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) in the Jharkhand capital, said it was the need of hour for increasing the ‘technological and core competence’ of the forces.
 
 “India is expected to grow into a $5 trillion economy in the next seven years. So the anti-nationalist and terrorist forces will continue to pull us down from within and outside the country and we have accepted the challenge against them,” Singh said. 
 
 “Paramilitary forces, including the CISF are well trained. But they have to increase their core-competence against terrorism,” he added.
 
 Stating cyber terrorism a ‘big challenge,’ Singh stressed that the forces must also be “technologically competent to handle and eliminate such situations”.
 
 India’s paramilitary forces currently comprise the CISF, Indo-Tibetian Border Police (ITBP), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Special Protection Group (SPG).
 
 Singh on Sunday inaugurated the CISF’s new eastern sector headquarter in Ranchi’s Tiril. Spread over 158 acres, the new headquarter has been relocated from Bihar for better synergy, CISF director general OP Singh said.
 
 With security advisor K Vijay Kumar and chief minister Raghubar Das in tow, Singh claimed the Center’s demonetization move has broken the backs of banned left wing organizations like the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI) and CPI (Maoist). Maintaining that dialogue was the only means to resolve differences, the minister urged armed groups to come to the discussion table and place their demands instead of ‘stopping the development of the poor’.
