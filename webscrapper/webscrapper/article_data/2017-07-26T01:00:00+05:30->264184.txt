BIHARSHARIF: Former Biharsharif deputy   Shankar Sao on Tuesday narrowly escaped a bid on his life when a miscreant fired at his residence at Amber under Biharsharif police station area. Shankar entered the room to avoid any injury. 

 Police arrested one Mannu Yadav with a countrymade pistol, four live cartridges. Three used cartridges were also recovered from the spot, said Alok Kumar posted at Biharsharif police station.
 
 The accused is a resident of the same locality and he tried to kill Shankar as he is alleged to have sexually exploited his minor sister, the sources said.
 
 Terming the claim as absolute nonsense and rubbish, Shankarâ€™s wife and present Biharsharif deputy mayor Phoolmati Devi said the accused attacked her husband due to political rivalry. However, she did not elaborate.
