VADODARA: Ruckus broke out at Rukmani Chainani ward of   on Tuesday morning after one of the surviving twin girls died early in the morning.

 Family members of the one-month-old girl alleged that it was due to doctors’ negligence that the infant died.
 
 Sangeeta Macchi, a resident of  , prematurely delivered twin girls on August 10. 
 
 Machhi and her husband Mukesh were told by the doctors that both the girls are very weak and there are slim chances of survival of the younger girl. She died on August 31.
 
 Meanwhile, her twin sister too was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where she died early in the morning. Family members created ruckus in the ward alleging negligence on part of the doctors. 
 
 “Around 7.30 am, I called the nurse and the doctor as my daughter was not responding. They gave an injection and tried to supply oxygen but she was already dead by then,” said Mukesh, adding, “If the doctors would have checked on her, she would have survived.”
 
 Mukesh, who works at a garments shop in Raopura, also alleged that the hospital staff took blood samples of her daughter who died on Tuesday at least four times as they would misplace the blood reports. 
 
 Doctors at the hospital, however, said that the allegations made by the family were baseless. “Since the girl were born prematurely, they were underweight. They were in poor health since beginning,” said a doctor.
 
 As the situation became tense, the security staff of the hospital called cops from Raopura police station. After the policemen talked to the family members, they decided to accept her body.
