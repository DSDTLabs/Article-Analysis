NEW DELHI:   filed his nomination on Tuesday as the opposition candidate for the vice-president’s post, saying he wanted to fight the atmosphere of fear and restore the faith of the common man in politics.

 “In our country, we are living in times of division. A whole force which is dividing our country is in action mode and that spells danger to our future,” Gandhi told reporters after signing his papers flanked by top opposition leaders. He said a key inspiration for him to contest was the disconnect that has emerged between politics and people. “People’s faith in politics has diminished and has collapsed. I would like to see a revival of that faith,” he said. Gandhi said his nomination should not be seen as directed against anybody but as aimed at bridging the gulf between people and politics.
