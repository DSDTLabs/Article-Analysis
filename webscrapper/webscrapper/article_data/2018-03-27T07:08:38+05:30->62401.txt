BENGALURU: With five days left for the financial year to end, the   has collected around Rs 2,100 crore (including arrears in some cases) in property tax, a major source of revenue for the civic agency. However, the figure is well short of the target of Rs 2,600 crore that it had set in March 2017, indicating the   could once again fail to mop up the total amount.

 For 2016-17, the civic body had collected Rs 2,072 crore (as on March 20) in tax against a target of Rs 2,300 crore.
 
  
 However,   figures for the current financial year accessed by TOI show that it is yet to collect more than Rs 2,265 crore in property tax (including arrears from previous years).
 
 Figures from the Palike’s revenue department show that as many 1.79 lakh properties are yet to pay taxes ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 crore, with the total outstanding money under the head totalling Rs 1,756 crore. “In addition, there are 105 properties whose pending tax payment exceeds Rs 1 crore each and the total they owe is Rs 339 crore. Also, Rs 170 crore or more is expected from 109 high-value properties. BBMP’s total station survey (TSS) shows these properties had been undervalued. All these add to Rs 2,265 crore,” said a senior BBMP official.
 
 In fact, BBMP officials say the pending revenue could be even more. “Since the properties identified under TTS have undervalued themselves, they will have to pay a penalty, which is double the amount evaded. So, including the interest and penalty, the amount under this head will touch Rs 600 crore,” said a revenue official, adding that most of these properties are tech parks and malls.
 
 According to revenue officials, of the amount payable to BBMP, only Rs 400-500 crore pertains to this year’s property tax collection. The remaining is arrears from previous years. “Many might have submitted challans or cheques to banks. These could take a few days to be realised. We will be able to get a clear picture only in the first week of April. By then, the collected amount might increase by Rs 100-150 crore,” an official said.
 
 “We will issue warrants and seize movable articles of those with pending arrears. While we will try to collect the revenue, it’s not possible to collect the entire target amount,” said M Venkatachalapathy, joint commissioner (revenue), BBMP.
