NEW DELHI: In   on Monday,   sought an answer from the government on Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks that PM   had skipped Palestine during his recent visit to the Jewish state because it could not offer technology and water to India.

 The Congress criticised   for completely ignoring Palestine during his visit to Israel from July 4 to 6, with former defence minister A K Antony saying it would have “far-reaching implications” for India.
 
 Congress leader Anand-Sharma said an Israeli newspaper had released an audio clip in which  , during a closed-door session in Budapest with leaders from Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia which was inadvertently broadcast, said Modi had chosen Israel over Palestine to get technology and water.
