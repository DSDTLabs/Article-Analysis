 Shahbaz who has osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition in which the body doesn't produce calcium, restricting bone development, took the exam lying on a stretcher. He was brought to the exam centre by ambulance. "He can't sit up and hence could never attend school, but we had tuition teachers coming home to teach him as he was very enthusiastic to learn," said his mother,  . "After class X, he wanted to continue his education."
 
 Even though he is bound to a bed, Ansari wants to be able to help his mother who works as a house help to provide for him when her husband died 10 years ago. "Even if I can't move around, I can use a computer so I hope to do a course that will help me get a job," he said. He took the exam from the commerce stream using a writer.
 
 He had scored 67% in SSC. "We are looking for computer courses he can do. We also support him with study material he requires," said  , president of  , an NGO that helps Shahbaz's family. -Vinamrata Borwankar
