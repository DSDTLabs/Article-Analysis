NEW DELHI:   played host to more than 350 schoolchildren from Kashmir on Tuesday as part of the MHRD’s student exchange programme — ‘Maitreyi Yatra’. The students, studying in classes IX to XII, were told about the colleges, courses and the procedure for admissions.

 The students showed keen interest in the university and asked a number of questions on getting admissions. The screening of student films and the opportunity to showcase their talents when allowed to sing hit Bollywood numbers added an extra charm to the occasion.
 
 Mohammad Ayub, principal of High Secondary School DH Pora, Kulgam, who was accompanying the students, said that the students showed keen interest coming to the capital. For many of them, it was their first trip to Delhi. “With initiatives like these, they will get to know about more opportunities to receive higher education. Many of them will likely apply here in the near future,” he said.
 
 Huddled together in the conference room, the students listened to the presentations shown by the   officials. A number of questions were also put up to the officials about the application procedure, the course details and the percentage required for admissions.
 
 Irtiza Hamid, a Class XII student from a school in Nawakadal, Srinagar, said that she felt inspired by the university and its infrastructure. “It’s a beautiful place and I would like to study here. I also asked questions about studying MBA in DU” she said.
 
 The deputy dean of student’s welfare (DSW) Gurpreet Singh Tuteja conducted the Q&A session which included questions on the university resources for the disabled, minorities and Kashmiri students. Tuteja told the students that the “university accepts all students from all states and are accepted by all.”
