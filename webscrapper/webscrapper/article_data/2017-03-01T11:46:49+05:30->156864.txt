 With the road transport department silent, travel operators continue to flout norms.Shockingly , the transport department imposed a fine on Tuesday's ill-fated bus last month in East Godavari district for rash driving. The bus was proceeding to Visakhapatnam from Hyderabad and the speed of the bus recorded more than 120 km. “The driver himself confessed to the violation and agreed to pay the fine,“ said Vijayawada RTO M Purendra.
