New Delhi: Even as   told the high court that it won’t take any coercive action against chief secretary  , the   marked him absent for not showing up. The committee had earlier sent a notice to Prakash on March 1 for not appearing before question and reference committee on February 23. 

 “Prakash, registrar of cooperative societies J B Singh and his predecessor Shurbir Singh were marked absent as they did not appear. The   said he couldn’t come due to medical reasons and the other two sent their lawyers on their behalf,” said Saurabh Bharadwaj, member of the question and reference committee. 
 
 Meanwhile, the boycott by the bureaucracy continued on Monday with a five-minute silence observed as a mark of protest against the alleged assault on Prakash. Principal secretary finance S N Sahai, however, attended a crucial meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the budget. 
 
 Bharadwaj also claimed, “The CS moved court to seek a stay on all proceedings of the privilege committee and stop the assembly committees from calling him. He was not granted any relief.”
 
 AAP sources said due to lack of clarity in the party if the assembly panels could again ask Prakash to appear before it while the matter is in court, legal opinion would be taken on the matter before deciding future course of action.
