PUNE: Burdened with tonnes of  , the civic body has appointed   from dumping trash in the city limits.

 Confirming the development, a senior official of the   ( ) said, “We have made it clear to the villages’ administrations and the zilla parishad to stop dumping garbage in the city. Our squads will now monitor the trash-laden trucks coming to the city and stop them from open dumping,” he said.
 
 The villages on the city’s fringes dump about 300 tonnes of garbage in Pune limits. In a bid to stop the inflow of trash to the city, the civic body has asked the zilla parishad to take care of the waste generated in villages.
 
 A source in PMC said most garbage-laden vehicles from the peripheral villages enter the city’s outskirts at night to dump the trash at open spots, grounds and riverside areas. The civic administration would be monitoring such activities strictly from now on, he said.
 
 The corporation has stopped inflow of garbage from the villages in the eastern parts of the city. For villages in the southern and western parts, the ban is being imposed in phases. In the next few days, the squads appointed by the administration would stop the inflow of garbage from any peripheral village.
 
 The senior civic body official said villages should set up their own machinery to deal with garbage. “The population in villages has been on the rise because of growth in the real estate sector. The changing scenario has prompted the need for more facilities to deal with daily garbage outside the city. The administration has written to the zilla parishad to look into the matter with utmost priority,” the official said.
 
 A source in zilla parishad said a meeting with the villages’ representative would be convened to discuss the issue in details and chalk out a plan to ensure processing of daily waste at source.
 
 Residents of peripheral areas said the issue was serious in many fringe areas. They stressed the administration should act to deal with it.
