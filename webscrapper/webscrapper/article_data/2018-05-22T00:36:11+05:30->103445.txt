State transport minister M R Vijayabaskar has said that there was no move to privatise transport corporations in the state. 

 “It is an argument of the trade unions to wrongly divert the employees. There is no such move to privatising the corporations. The employment of the transport corporation employees will also be assured,” Vijayabaskar told reporters after attending a function to issue free land title worth Rs 2.40 crore to 109 beneficiaries in ward one in Karur municipality on Monday. 
 
 He also said that the state government has allotted Rs 3,500 crore fund to the transport corporations. 
 
 However, he said that the corporation has stopped services of buses in the same route at small intervals with poor patronage. “The action will help the corporations to reduce the loss of revenue, expense on diesel and accidents,” said the minister. 
 
 On increasing the fleets of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and State Express Transport Corporation (SETC), the minister said that the transport corporation will be added with 5,000 more buses this year.
 
 “Late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had ordered to procure 2,000 buses. The process of bus body building is already on. The chief minister has now ordered to procure 3,000 more buses. Efforts are on to ensure all the buses are equipped with safety measures and facilities,” he said.
