After playing his sister-in-law in the TV show 'Sasural Simar Ka', Jyotsna Chandola is all set to romance Dheeraj Dhoopar in a web series. While the actress continues to be part of the daily soap, Dheeraj quit it a few months ago.  Speaking about working with Dheeraj, who played her jethji in the past, Jyotsna says, "Dheeraj and I had an amazing time together on the show and became good friends. I'm sure it will be fun to work with him again. It's quite funny that I used to call him Prem bhaiya in the show, while he will play my love interest in the web series."  Interestingly, the series has been directed by her husband, director Nitesh Singh. Was she comfortable romancing another man while her husband called the shots? "On the contrary, I am more comfortable with him helming it. We will also shoot some bold scenes. I don't mix my personal and professional lives.‚Äù
