MYSURU: A day after JD(S) leader Kalale Keshavmurthy said that he has quit the party, JD(S) leaders on Wednesday indicated that the party may consider fielding a candidate to take on   and   in the   bypoll.

 The party top brass led by JD (S) supremo H D Deve Gowda and state unit chief   will take a call at a meeting later this week. Party district unit chief N Narasimha Swamy said that party leaders have called a meeting on Friday to discuss the strategy to be adopted for the bypoll. The party will decide on the candidate at the Bengaluru meeting, he said here on Wednesday. “There is no dearth of candidates to contest the bypoll,” he stated.
 
 This comes on a day when Keshavmurthy, who headed the party’s Nanjangud taluk unit, resigned from the primary membership of the party. The Nanjangud town unit chief   too quit the party and handed over his resignation to Narasimha Swamy.
 
 The JD (S) district chief, however, contested Keshavmurthy’s assertion that Deve Gowda has approved his plan. The party leaders had planned to field him in the polls and were also planning to nominate him to the legislative council, he argued. He asked party councillors who have identified with Keshavmurthy to resign as members from the municipality.
 
 Meanwhile, the JD(S) has appointed R V Mahadeva Swamy as the new chief of the party’s Nanjangud taluk unit. He took charge immediately after Keshavmurthy handed in his resignation indicating the party leaders’ aim to rebuild the party following an exodus of party leaders.
