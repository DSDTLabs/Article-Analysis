GURUGRAM: A boosting station without water pipelines, a park flooded with sewage and roads littered with garbage sum up the plight of residents living in  , a developing area in the city.

 If their days stink, nights are often dark due to irregular power supply. And to add to their woes, their repeated pleas to Huda officials and the local   seem to have fallen on deaf ears.According to the residents, regular load-shedding and lack of piped water supply are major issues that are plaguing the area. Though water was supposed to be supplied from a boosting station in Sector 52, Huda, which is expected to look after the civic amenities in the area, is yet to lay down pipelines. 
 
 While Huda officials claim encroachments are posing hurdles, the residents allege the development authority has done little to remove the squatters and ensure water supply. And with summer coming up, residents are bracing for a major crisis. Erratic power supply is another problem that has left the residents high and dry. “In past four years or so, the number of houses has gone up to 150,” said BL Yadav, president of RWA, Sector 52. Sewer lines are broken at several places, leading to flooding of roads that create problems for people on foot. “Drain water is flowing onto roads in front of houses. The local park is flooded by dirty water… it is impossible to even walk past it, let alone playing or sitting at the park,”   added. Empty plots have turned into dump yards while garbage mounds dot the streets. “
 
 Huda administrator   said: “If there is any issue, the residents can come and meet me. We will do our best to resolve the problems.” 
 
 “I am aware of the problems and I have spoken to the departments concerned. I will ensure that their issues are fixed fast,” said MLA Umesh Agarwal.
