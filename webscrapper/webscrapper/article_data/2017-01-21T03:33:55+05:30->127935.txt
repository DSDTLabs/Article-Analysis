NEW DELHI: Even as the North Delhi Municipal Corporation finds it difficult to pay salaries to its employees, it is focusing on   for voters rather than strengthening revenue generation schemes. Such a short-term treatment of the civic body’s resource problems was perhaps inevitable given the imminent elections.

 The North Corporation has a funding   of around Rs 2,400 crore, which is expected to go up to Rs 3,600 crore by next year. 
 
 “We don’t have funds to pay the salaries in the coming months and we are banking on Delhi government to provide us relief,” admitted a senior civic official. But contrary to the demands of the financial situation, the civic body proposes to waive the penalty for people who haven’t paid their municipality taxes and to do away with conversion charges. 
 
 Parvesh Wahi, chairman of the standing committee, also proposed on Friday to hike the local area development fund for councillors to Rs 1 crore annually from the existing Rs 50 lakh.
 
 Amid such profligacy, Wahi remained optimistic of higher revenues. “The waste-to-energy plant at   landfill site is almost ready. It has been decided that North Corporation will get 3% as share from the energy sold to discoms,” he announced, while hoping for similar revenue shares from the waste-to-energy plants at Okhla and Ghazipur.
 
 He said other ways to boost earnings would be letting out Ramlila Maidan for weddings, allowing advertisements on the corporation website, registering farm houses and imposing way-leave charges, all of which could bring in an extra Rs 100 crore. “We will also lease out a portion of the Civic Centre to generate Rs 90 crore annually,” Wahi said.
 
 Senior officials were disappointed that property tax was not raised. “We need to increase the property tax every three years, but due to political pressure this hasn’t been done for several years,” said one of them.
