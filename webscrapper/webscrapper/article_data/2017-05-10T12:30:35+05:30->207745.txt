PANAJI: Goa   on Monday suspended two constables who were missing from their designated posts on a police control room (PCR) van, for dereliction of duties.

  superintendent of police (SP) Karthik Kashyap said he had suspended constables Budhaj Naik and Sudatta Khadpe for being absent from their designated location during duty hours, and added that the duo had gone somewhere with the vehicle without making any entry in the control room log.
 
 Kashyap also said that PCR van staff had recently been warned against moving around without informing the control room, after it was noticed that the 30-odd PCR vans across the state were often absent from their designated locations or missing from patrolling duties.
 
 The department had received several complaints regarding PCR vans not being on the roads. An inquiry had revealed that some personnel on PCR van duties shirked patrolling responsibilites by going to isolated spots to take power naps while on duty.
