KOHIMA/AIZAWL: Three Christian-dominated states in the northeast will not observe   on Friday. 

 The Centre's proposal to celebrate Digital India Day on April 14 was rejected by Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya as it coincides with Good Friday.
 
 The Mizoram government and the Young Mizo Association (YMA), the apex body of Mizos, expressed displeasure over the Centre's proposal to celebrate Digidhan Mela on the same day as Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ was crucified. The YMA added that the Centre's proposal was a "deliberate insult" to Christian religion. The state's chief secretary Lalmalsawma on Thursday sent a letter intimating the Centre of the "inability to celebrate Digidhan Mela".
 
 Meanwhile, Congress in Mizoram on Thursday also condemned the Centre's decision, terming it as an assault on secularism and the sentiments of Christian community. "The decision to observe Good Governance Day on Christmas amounted to attack on the religion and the latest decision to observe Digital India Day on Good Friday is rubbing salt on the injuries," a Congress statement said.
 
 Nagaland chief secretary Pankaj Kumar on Thursday said Nagaland will not observe any promotional activity of digital payment on April 14. The   (NBCC) acknowledged that it received assurance from the state government that Digital India Day will not be observed on April 14. The NBCC stated, "This is a time when Christians all over the world commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ."
 
 Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma too lambasted the BJP-led NDA government for its decision. In Meghalaya, however, BJP clarified that the day was chosen because it falls on Ambedkar Jayanti, and termed it "sheer coincidence".
