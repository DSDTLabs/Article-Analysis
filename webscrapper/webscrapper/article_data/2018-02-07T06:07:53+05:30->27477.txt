KOLKATA: Visitors and booksellers at the   (IKBF) had a lot to complain about mobile and internet connectivity as calls failed to go through, went blank or suddenly dropped in the midst of conversations. Internet connection was as miserable.

 Hundreds were seen desperately trying to dial numbers on their mobiles that drew a blank. “I came to the fair despite failing health and now, I cannot call my driver,” said  , a retired college professor.
 
 The young social mediaaddicted crowd seemed vexed at not being able to chat over mobile or post photos or comment on different networking sites as they walked from stall to stall, browsing and picking up books. Even as their cellphones displayed poor network status, they desperately tried to “catch” the elusive signal, moving from one spot to another. “What is the fun in taking selfies if you can’t post them on FB instantly?” said  , an engineering student at JIS Institute.
 
 Even booksellers were having a trying time owing to poor network; at several stalls, credit card swipe machines failed to function properly. The Penguin Publishers stall was among those affected. Spokesperson Pinaki Sarkar said that sales were hit on the first four days because the machines did not work. “A large number of buyers had to leave without buying because they wanted to use their credit cards. We have complained to the organisers,” he said.
 
 The Publishers and   admitted there was a problem of mobile and internet connectivity but blamed it on the huge crowd that the fair had been witnessing every day. “No matter how hard we try, this jamming will take place because almost everyone coming to the fair uses a smartphone. Every moment they want to call or connect. This heavy pressure is causing the problem,” said  , guild president.
 
 Service providers have set up dedicated towers but still can’t to fulfil the demand, especially after 5pm, when the crowd surges.
