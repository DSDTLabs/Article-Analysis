Mumbai: In a move that is being seen as premature, markets regulator   on Friday said from now on mutual fund (MF) houses will be able to charge an additional   ( ) of up to 30   (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) — as expenses — for distributing their products in all places that are beyond the top 30 cities.

 TER is a percentage of a mutual fund scheme’s corpus that a fund house is allowed to charge to meet costs like fund management, marketing & distribution, administration, etc. In 2012, Sebi had allowed fund houses to charge this 30bps as extra expense even for places which were beyond the top 15 cities (T-15). 
 
 Industry players felt that the government was cautious since too much money was flowing into the stock market through the MF route and hence is trying to lower the incentives to distribute funds in those places from where a majority of the funds come in.
 
 “Since more than five years have elapsed and on review, it is now decided that the additional TER of up to 30 basis points would be allowed for inflows from beyond top 30 cities instead of beyond top 15 cities,” a Sebi circular noted. The new expense costs will be effective from April 1, 2018.
