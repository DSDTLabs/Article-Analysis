Rajkot: Three persons were injured in a clash between two groups belonging to different communities in Chudasama Plot near Amrapali railway crossing in Rajkot on Saturday night. 

 Police said Shailesh Raiyani (44), a resident of Nandubag Society on Sant Kabir Road, his elder brother Pravin Raiyani (50) and Pravin's wife Hira (45), both residents of Adarsh Society on Chudasama Plot, were attacked by a dozen assailants led by Bhavesh Lokhil, a resident of Ranchhodnagar.
 
 “The attack was the result of a dispute between the Raiyanis and Lokhil over a piece of land at Jiyana village of Rajkot taluka. On Saturday night, the accused intercepted Shailesh and asked him to hand over documents related to the land. The accused went to Adarsh Society along with Shailesh and attacked both of them with swords, iron pipes and bats. When Hira intervened, she too was attacked,” said Gandhigram PI H R Bhatu.
