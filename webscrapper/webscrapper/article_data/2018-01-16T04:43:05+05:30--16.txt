NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday refused to allow private unaided schools to   fee to implement recommendations of the 7th pay commission.

 A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Deepa Sharma also took a dim view of two forums approaching it for permission to hike fee or collect already announced hike amount from parents in certain schools.
 
 The bench was of the view if an individual school is aggrieved by the court’s stay it can approach it but not “proxy” forums.
 
 The court was hearing fresh applications filed by action committee of Unaided Recognized   and National Progressive Schools Conference, two associations seeking to modify the court’s earlier order.
 
 One of the applicants urged the court to modify its order to the extent that those schools which have already hiked their fee before the order should be allowed to collect the amount. It also sought a clarification that the stay should apply only to the school against whom the original petition was filed.
 
 But   refused to be drawn into the argument or to lift the stay it imposed on December 20 last year. It simply posted the pleas for further hearing later this week.
 
 The court had last month granted interim stay after the AAP government undertook to keep the fee hike notification of October 17, 2017 in abeyance.
 
 It had acted on a petition filed by 88 children of ASN Public School, Mayur Vihar, through advocate Khagesh Jha. They had also challenged the fee hike notification and sought its quashing on the ground that it was an ad hoc decision and was passed without examining accounts of the schools.
