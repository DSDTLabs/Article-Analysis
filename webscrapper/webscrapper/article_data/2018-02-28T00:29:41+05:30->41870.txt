New Delhi: The Delhi   on Tuesday made it clear that the   on   can’t   beyond those   in it by the  .

 Setting aside a sealing direction given by the panel to the north corporation, HC said the panel was set up with a view to check misuse of residential properties for commercial gains and it   begin issuing directions against other types of premises.
 
 “Since the MC is a creation of the orders passed by the SC, it derives its authority only from its orders. It has no independent statutory existence or powers,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli noted while quashing the MC’s direction.
 
 The court clarified that “the authorisation of the MC by the Supreme Court from time to time has been in relation to the misuser/non-confirming user of the residential premises for industrial or commercial purpose. The same does not relate to the alleged misuser of industrial premises for commercial purpose — which is the alleged misuser in the present case.”
 
 HC cited the orders passed by the Supreme Court to note that initially MC was empowered to undertake decisions on sealing of, primarily, residential properties which were used for industrial or commercial purposes.
 
 “The MC was constituted in view of the apathy shown by the municipal corporation and other limbs of the state in implementing the directions issued by the SC with regard to stoppage of industrial and commercial use of residential premises. The MC was constituted to oversee the implementation of the law regarding residential premises being misused for commercial (non-industrial) purposes,” the bench added.
 
 It was hearing a case where the north corporation and MC had sealed a factory whose owner had won the case before a single judge of HC and an appeal was pending before the bench. The court disapproved of the manner in which the MC tried to alter the status quo.
