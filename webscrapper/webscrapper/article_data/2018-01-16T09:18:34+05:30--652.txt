PUNE: Within two months of its inauguration, the   outlet on the premises of   in Shivajinagar has become a hot shopping destination for those who love all things ethnic. 

 Opened on November 16 last year by the Maharashtra Khadi and   to promote local entrepreneurs and manufacturers of khadi in the state, it has been witnessing a footfall of nearly 75 to 80 people and an earning of over Rs 10,000 daily.
 
 “Overall, the response has been good. The footfall is even higher on weekends. We also see a lot of repeat customers who come to buy Mahakhadi food or ayurvedic products. The prices of products are on the higher side as compared to other brands as they are all handmade but people keep coming back to us because of the quality,” said Swapnil Patil, accountant at Papertells.
 
 He stated that food products like local pickles, nachani biscuits and traditional candies are among the highest selling products. “Artefacts and decorative items made of bamboo, cane, terracotta and copper are also in demand,” he said.
 
 However, district village industries officer Ashok Laad said that while the response has been good, it has not met their expectation. “We expected a daily income of at least Rs 20,000 but that has not happened. However, without any advertising and promotion, the store is doing quite well. We are sure that revenue will further increase in near future,” he stated.
 
 According to Laad, the department is in the process of increasing product portfolio at the outlet. “We are in talks with our weavers to provide khadi silk saris at the outlet. We have also hired a fashion designer to aid weavers in designing kurtas and tops,” he said.
 
 On the lines of Mahakhadi, the department has also registered the trademark   to brand another set of products made by associate entrepreneurs. “The brand will be used to brand products with a chemical base like soaps and shampoos. These products too will be available at the Mahakhadi outlet soon,” he added.
