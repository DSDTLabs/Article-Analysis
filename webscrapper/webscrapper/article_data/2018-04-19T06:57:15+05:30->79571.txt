PM   was met with big shows of support from the Indian community in London on Wednesday but also faced protests from Sikh and Kashmiri groups making separatist demands as well as demands for human rights and justice, and from a small group of men from   protesting against what they said was the imposition of the NEET medical entrance exam in their state. 

 
 Members of the Indian Ladies in UK (ILUK) held Indian flags, sang, danced to “Jai Ho!” and “India Waale” and chanted “Har Har Modi” as PM   left 10 Downing Street at 10 am, after meeting British PM Theresa May. But further down the road three men from Tamil Nadu dressed in black waited holding black flags.
