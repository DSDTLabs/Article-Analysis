PATNA: Former CM   on Friday backtracked from her statement on Thursday and said there was no vacancy for the “CM post” in   and   will continue to hold the coveted post.

 Rabri, wife of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, had said her son   would be the next CM of Bihar, triggering speculations about the change of guard in the grand alliance government.
 
 “If people wish so, Tejashwi will become CM. People happen to be ‘malik’ (master) in democracy,” Rabri said on Thursday when asked about some RJD legislators’ demand that her younger son and deputy CM should replace Nitish as CM.
 
 Rabri’s statement invited sharp reaction from Nitish’s JD(U). Senior JD(U) man Shyam Rajak said, “Every person has right to speak in a democracy. But Nitish is the leader of the three-party grand alliance in Bihar and he will continue as the CM.”
 
 Expecting more aggressive reply from the JD(U), Rabri on Friday said, “My Thursday statement was not reported properly by the media. I never meant that way.”
 
 Hours after Rabri’s clarification, Lalu also tried to play down the controversy by saying, “Koi aaapa-dhapi nahin hai yehan CM post ke liye. Samay sab tay kar dega (There is no hurry for the CM post. Time will decide everything).”
 
 Lalu also said, “Tejashwi abhi seekh raha hai. Aanewala bhavishya uska hai. Vartmaan sarkar sahi se chal rahi hai. Abhi isme koi pherbadal nahi hoga (Tejashwi is still learning. The future is with him. This government is running perfectly. There is no need of any change)”.
