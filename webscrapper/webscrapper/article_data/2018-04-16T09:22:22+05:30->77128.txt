PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s wife and former   CM   shot off a second letter to Bihar CM   on Sunday demanding a detailed explanation for removal of security guards from her residence and the officers responsible for it.

 Writing under her personal letterhead, she questioned, “First, I must get a reply and report why the security was withdrawn from 10 Circular Road on April 10 midnight without any formal letter and at whose orders? I need explanation.”
 
 Rabri, in her letter on Sunday, stated: “Why the police officials were not picking the repetitive calls made by former deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav and former minister Tej Pratap Yadav (after removal of security guards on April 10)?   even wrote several letters to the home department, seeking the reply on removal of Z-plus category security. But they haven’t given any reply so far,”   wrote in the letter.
