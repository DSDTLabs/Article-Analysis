NOIDA: Traffic crawled on arterial roads of the city for almost five hours on Saturday as thousands of people thronged the   in Sector 95 to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti.

 Those travelling from Noida to Delhi had to battle snarls intermittently from around 11am to 4pm due to mismanagement on the part of the authorities and illegal parking on the sides of the main  .
 
 As the only multi-level parking facility inside the memorial premises was not put to use, members of Dalit organisations and supporters of different political and social outfits parked their vehicles on the 2km long stretch abutting the memorial.
 
 A procession led by Dalit Utthan Sangharsh Mahasabha, in which hundreds of supporters of Dr B R Ambedkar participated, started from   around 10am and arrived at the memorial via Film City flyover in noon. Participants gathered on the flyover holding pictures of Ambedkar and walked towards the memorial, raising slogans of “Jai Bhim”.
 
 This led to traffic remaining stranded on the flyover for almost an hour, which in turn resulted in snarls on the Noida-Delhi carriageway of the link road. Snarls continued till evening as participants started leaving around 1.30pm.
 
 Both civil and traffic police seemed helpless in controlling the snarls. Constables could be seen rebuking people who had been waiting on the main road to pick up their friends, thus blocking the traffic coming from behind. Traffic police officers, who had deployed around 50 constables and home guards around the area, rued that the only parking facility was not used.
