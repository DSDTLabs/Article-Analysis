Singer John   says music producer   is one of his role models and the two have discussed about a possible collaboration. 

 The "All Of Me" singer said Jones' work has hugely inspired him, reported Billboard.
 
 "Quincy Jones is certainly of them (role model). We talk about a lot of things. He's hugely influential to me and he's always been a role model to me. Both of us have been in a position where music has opened up a lot of doors for us and given us a lot of influence and we wanted to carry that into other areas and particularly into film because music and film are so related. 
 
 "We've talked about working together. He and my father actually have a hat line they're doing together. Popz Topz is my father's hat brand, and Quincy's going to do a special collection with him," Legend said.
