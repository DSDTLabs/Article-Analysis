Chandigarh/Ludhiana: The two motorcycle-borne assailants, who killed Ludhiana pastor   outside a church on Saturday were not sporting any headgear, according to the slain priest’s wife. The 53-year-old priest at Peeru Banda Mohalla church in Salem Tabri of Ludhiana, was talking on his phone when the assailants struck at 8.36pm.

 Masih’s wife Sarabjit has recorded her police statement. She and her son Hanuk were standing in the verandah when the incident took place, states the FIR. Sarabjit also disclosed in her statement that only the assailant riding pillion on the motorcycle had his face covered, but eye witnesses said the faces of both the killers were covered. “Mere pati nu maaran do maune jawan Pulsar motorcycle te aaye, jina wich ik ne mooh baneya hoya si (Two clean-shaven men without any headgear came on a Pulsar motorcycle to kill my husband. Only one of them had his face covered. He was sitting on the back),” stated Sarabjit.
 
 Even at the time of crisis, the 50-year-old woman showed resilience, as she herself tried to chase the assailants. In the FIR, she stated that she saw the killers racing the bike towards Jalandhar byepass. “If they are ever held and shown to me, I can recognise them by their faces,” she states. The family has also told the police that they had been living inside the church for 30 years, and they never had any dispute with the neighbours.
 
 Though Ludhiana police have, so far, not included any charges of hurting religious sentiments or inciting communal hatred, Punjab chief minister Captain   on Sunday issued a statement directing the police chief to start “a crackdown on elements trying to whip up communal passions in the state by indulging in such attacks, and to remain on high alert against such forces.”
