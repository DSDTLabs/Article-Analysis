PUNE: The rough roads of   and unreliability of   utility vehicles continued to put spokes in the season-opening rally for Sanjay  , but the Pune rally driver braved the conditions and drove most part of last three stages on just one gear to finish third overall in the Thailand Pre-Rally Championship.

 
 The script was almost the same as last year in Thailand in the early part of the season, but Takale made sure his position will be counted and his navigator Thanyaphat   gets enough points for the Thailand co-driver's championship.
 
 As Takale aims to get more miles behind the wheel on varied terrains before his World Rally Championship debut tentatively in May, this Thailand experience should give him confidence in driving through rough terrains of any kind.
 
 "We had hydraulic clutch pump failure in Stage 6 so I drove the remaining kilometres of the stage in the second gear only and lost more than a minute there," is how Takale explained the situation he was in.
 
 "Thankfully we managed to get to the service park, which was located at the end of the Stage 6. The problem was fixed in time and we continued on Stage 7," he added.
 
 Takale and Meemi then went flat out and completed Stage 7 second fastest among the rest of the competitors.
 
 "We began Stage 8 very well but midway through the drive clutch hydraulic pump broke because engine mount had broken and the engine had titled to one side," said Takale, who two weeks ago completed non-competitive drive through  .
 
 "We were stuck in the third gear now and I drove the remaining part of Stage 8 in just one gear. The ninth and final stage also was accomplished in one gear," Takale pointed out.
