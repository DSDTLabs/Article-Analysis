MUMBAI: The MMRDA’s long wait to get a safety certification for   finally ended on Tuesday, though it can start operations only after fulfilling certain conditions. The monorail will run between   and   Circle.

 Metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan said, “We are still going through the report. Certain conditions will have to be fulfilled before we can decide on the date of opening.”
 
 Safety inspector GP Garg, after taking a stock of the monorail corridor on March 28, asked the   to ensure that there is adequate stock of spare parts so that regular maintenance of rakes is not delayed. The monorail has been constructed in two phases: Chembur to   and Wadala to Jacob’s Circle. The phase one—Chembur to Wadala—was thrown open in 2014, however, the corridor was shut after a fire gutted a monorail coach on November 9 last year.
 
 In view of the fire, Garg has recommended that temperature gauges be installed in coaches so that excess heat is recorded and evacuation carried out. Smoke detectors too will be installed. MMRDA has also decided to install CCTV cameras on both ends of platforms and along the corridor for evacuation during emergencies. Evacuation chutes or midsection guideways are also being considered.
 
 Garg has also suggested that mirrors be installed towards the end of all platforms so that drivers can see if all passengers have boarded or alighted before starting the train. 
 
 MMRDA has a total of 10 monorail rakes and is in the process of procuring five more.
