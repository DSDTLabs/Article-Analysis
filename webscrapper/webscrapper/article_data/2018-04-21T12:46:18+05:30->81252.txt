MARGAO: Navelim Congress MLA Luizinho   on Friday urged government authorities to inspect and maintain old   (toilets) before undertaking construction of new toilets as part of Prime Minister  's mission of making India open defecation-free (ODF). He made this remark during the 'Prime Minister's Ujjwala Yojana Divas' celebrations. 

 Faleiro drew the attention of the South Goa BJP Lok Sabha MP Narendra   to the present conditions of the Sulabh Sauchalayas terming them as 'monuments' as he referred to the central government scheme of providing basic amenities such as electricity, water, gas and toilets to every household in India.
 
 Faleiro requested Sawaikar to ensure every house is supplied with a gas cylinder while instructing the BDO Amitesh Shirwaikar to conduct a survey of houses not availing of this scheme in Navelim.
 
 Sawaikar said, "The government's efforts are on towards finding a solution for the mining issue but requires some time as it is in consultation with the central government regarding auction of the mines. The government is also committed towards providing electricity connections to all households."
