On Wednesday, the fest season in campus finally commenced with the inaugural ceremony of Symphony, the annual cultural festival of   College. One of the highlights of the first day of the fest was Munadi, the street play competition, where dramatics societies of different colleges performed their annual productions on topical and relevant themes. Among the participants was Shades, the theatre society of  , which performed Kaalyugh. The reason the play caught everyone's attention was because of a reference to  's controversy-marred ' '. 

 The play highlighted how a leader, either political or religious, can make people follow a path, often a violent one, without providing any logical explanation. It starts with examples from history – from the Partition and the anti-Sikh riots to the recent rioting by Ram Rahim's followers. It then moves on to the   controversy. The scene shows a conversation between two people: "Joh muh par ghunghat rakhe hai woh hai maari maharani"; "Joh RK ka tattoo banwakar rasleela kare woh hai maari maharani"; "Movie toh humari release hoke rahegi Padmaavat…" Before they can finish the sentence and say 'Padmavati', another actor stops them at 'Padmaavat'.
 
  
  
 
 Prerak Sharma, president of the society, says, "Our play is not about what leaders say to evoke sentiments, but about how people follow them unquestioningly. This blind faith can reach an extreme point where people just follow things without applying any reason. Look at 'Padmaavat''s example, people haven’t watched the movie, but they want it banned, and make creative changes to it. We are not targeting any party or a person, we are questioning the way preconceived notions take an extreme turn due to blind faith."
