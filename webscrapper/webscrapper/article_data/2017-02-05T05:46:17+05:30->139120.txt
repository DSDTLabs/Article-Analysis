MUMBAI: The arrest of his own boss after a similar trap in the office, just four days ago, did not deter a civic official from taking a bribe. Days after the   (ACB) arrested an assistant engineer and a mukadam of the building and factory department of BMC's H-East ward (Santacruz), a junior engineer was caught on Saturday accepting a bribe.

 On Monday , the ACB arrested assistant engineer   (50), and mukadam Haresh Ganekar (55), for accepting a bribe of Rs 13,000 from a slum dweller in Bandra. The complainant in the case had renovated his hutment following which the accused issued him a demolition notice. He also demanded Rs 15,000 as bribe to stop the action.
 
 In the latest case, junior engineer Pradeep Jadhav (25) was caught by the ACB accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 from a civil contractor. Interestingly, Jadhav and Shah's offices are on the same floor, barely a few meters away from each other.Jadhav had threatened to issue a demolition notice to a slum built by the contractor. Jadhav told the contractor if he wanted to avoid the demolition notice he should cough up Rs 30,000. The contractor then approached the ACB. On Saturday, the ACB laid a trap and arrested Jadhav while he was accepting the first instalment of Rs 10,000.
 
 “After the first trap on Monday we did not think another trap so soon would be successful, but some corrupt officials are shameless,“ said a senior ACB official.
