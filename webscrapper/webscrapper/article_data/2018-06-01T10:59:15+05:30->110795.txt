TRICHY: The   International Airport’s domestic sky is set to become vibrant starting from June as new services are to be launched. Four services by IndiGo between Trichy and Chennai are to begin from June 1 and two services to Bengaluru and Kochi from June 28. A   service to Bengaluru is also set to be launched from July 1. With this, the number of domestic destinations connected with Trichy airport will go up to 13 per day from the existing six. Frequent domestic flyers consider these newly-added services a welcome move, as they can reach the cities – Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kochi, within few hours without wasting much time.

 Though the frequency of service is doubled from four to eight in the Trichy – Chennai sector, the inbound flights are filled almost 80%, while it was 50% on outbound flights, without affecting the existing operator’s regular travellers, a senior official from   said.
 
 “The potential of Trichy airport is huge but it has not been tapped so far. Now, various service providers have begun to realise the fact and this trend will definitely continue,” said V B Jaganath, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavors (TIDES).
 
 The Kochi flight would bring pilgrims to   and the Bengaluru flights would be useful for the business community and IT people other than the regular to and fro traffic on both sectors. The patronage may be less during the initial days, but airline companies must not withdraw their services stating patronage as a reason, he added.
 
 “From June 1 Trichy - Chennai - Trichy will have eight frequencies. Since all these are ATR aircraft and their departures are spread throughout the day, it gives time flexibility for passengers. Also, the fares are within reach. We are sure these flights will have good patronage and the operations will be successful,” said joint secretary of  , S A Mubashir.
