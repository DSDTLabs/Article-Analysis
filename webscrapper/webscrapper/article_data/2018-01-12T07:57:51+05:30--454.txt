CHENNAI: Even as theatres were gearing up for big film releases for the Pongal festival's long weekend, a bill introduced in the state assembly on Thursday has created confusion over a hike in local entertainment tax. 

 Tamil Nadu minister for municipal administration and rural development S P   moved a bill to amend the Tamil Nadu Local Authorities  , 2017, with retrospective effect from September 26, 2017, the date on which an ordinance was passed by the governor towards collecting local entertainment tax. The latest bill mentions entertainment tax at 30% for theatres in cities and towns and 20% for others.
 
 "Once an ordinance is passed, it has to be made into an Act within six months. The rates were brought down twice last year to the present level. There is no change in taxation and the bill is only for regularising of what has been implemented," Tamil Nadu municipal administration secretary   clarified, when contacted by TOI.
 
 While the government originally wanted to collect 30% local tax last year, protracted negotiations by theatre owners and representatives of the film industry brought it down to 8% for Tamil films, 15% for other Indian language films and 20% for English films. "We have been collecting only those rates from the public and paying the government. But, the new bill has created confusion by referring to 30% and 20%. We have sought clarity,"  , president, Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners' Association told TOI.
