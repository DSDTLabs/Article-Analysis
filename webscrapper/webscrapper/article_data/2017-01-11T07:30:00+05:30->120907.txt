CHANDIGARH: The   (AAP) has filed a complaint with the   (EC), alleging that Punjab DGP Suresh Arora favoured the ruling SAD-BJP alliance and the Congress during his tenure in the vigilance bureau.

 AAP has accused Arora of “purposefully” not arresting the five gangsters had fled the high-security Nabha prison on November 27 and crossed the Haryana border. It added that Arora “served” his political masters and played an instrumental role in clearing a 10-year-old corruption cases against Punjab Congress president   and   (SAD) MLA and agriculture minister Tota Singh, three months before polls.
 
 The complaint was made barely hours before chief election commissioner Naseem Zaidi was to visit Punjab for a two-day tour. While the EC has already shifted out 14 cops, Zaidi had last month publically warned against deployment of   (PPS) cops and SAD leaders who have been designated as the party’s halqa in charges.
 
 The allegations came two days after the state government took away the charge of vigilance bureau (VB) from Arora amid apprehensions that EC was planning to question about how the cop was holding two key posts in the middle of elections. “They have cleverly withdrawn the vigilance charge to mislead the EC as if the watchdog can be misled. I am sure EC will put a fair and honest man," said Navkiran Singh, AAP human rights cell in charge who submitted the complaint before the EC.
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Punjab government had removed then DGP Sumedh Saini, following series of complaints by Congress on alleged collusion between the top cop and SAD.
