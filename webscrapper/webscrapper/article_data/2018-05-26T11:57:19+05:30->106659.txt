CHANDIGARH: A day after developmental projects got stuck due to paucity of funds, the recently-joined municipal commissioner, Kamal Kishore Yadav, has asked for five years’ records of expenditures and revenue from the accounts department of the civic body. The commissioner has also sought details of property tax collection in a bid to calculate the actual revenue. 

 As the gap between the revenue generation and expenditure of the civic body has widened in the past few years, the MC’s incomes and fixed deposits have been shrinking day-by-day.
 
 According to sources, in the last five years, the financial situation of the   has depleted, and the corporation has failed to leverage additional resources to increase its revenues. “Now, the situation has reached a point, where the MC does not have enough money to execute basic developmental works,” the sources said.
 
 “We have been looking in all the areas, from where we can increase incomes in judicious manner. As per preliminary exercise, it seems that we have some options and therefore a detailed study is being done in this regard,” said Yadav. Sources further revealed that some departments owe the MC a lot of money. “The corporation may get strict to get its money from those departments,” sources said.
 
 As per the records, the MC has committed liabilities, including salaries and bills, of around Rs 41 crore a month. “The MC requires minimum of Rs 492 crore in financial year 2018-19 to cater to its basis liabilities,” the sources said.
 
 What is more interesting is the fact that for the current financial year, the UT administration has approved a sum of Rs 269 crore for the MC. The civic body generates around Rs 171 crore revenue. Thus, the MC just has Rs 440 crore in its kitty, and is short of Rs 52 crore.
 
 Due to this fund crunch, the MC was forced to stop developmental works like construction of roads, community centres, development of parks and green belts, installation of tiles and paver blocks.
