Ranjith Sankar’s latest directorial   has been touted as a mature love story featuring   and   as its protagonists named Ram and Malini, respectively.

 The first half of the film, which is 122-minute long, starts off with Elvis (Joju George) and Malini – a couple with a 10-year-old daughter. They hardly have any feelings of love left for each other. The initial half shows how a resort owner and environmentalists play a crucial role in their life. 
 
 The best part of the film is the time spent at Eden resort owned by Raman in Vagamon. With some beautiful visuals that eloquently present the serene mood of these locales, it invites the viewers too to take a trip to the woods and relax.
 
 If the first half is any indication, the film is for those who take their better halves for granted, and who want to take a break from monotonous lives and relationships.
