LUCKNOW: The crackdown on   and   has sent Rs 22,000-crore   of   into a tailspin. 

 The industry, the  , accounts for 60% of India's total production. The total worth of meat and associated industries, including leather and by-products, is Rs 50,000 crore.
 
 In the past one month, since the BJP launched a campaign for a complete ban on illegal slaughterhouses as well as the mechanised abattoirs, meat exporters, who send their products to more than 50 countries, have lost Rs 4,000 crore due to cancellation of orders. The meat exporters are now contemplating shifting base to Punjab or southern states.
 
 In view of the threat of closure, the All India Meat and Live Exporters Association (AIMLEA), a body of registered meat exporters of the country, has sent a delegation to Lucknow. AIMLEA secretary general DB Sabbarwal has submitted a memorandum to the state government, saying that the industry will be closed if the government doesn't intervene quickly.
 
 Although the Yogi government has so far ordered the closure of illegal slaughterhouses, the BJP's poll promise that "not only the illegal slaughterhouses, but also mechanised abattoirs would be closed down" has been creating confusions, says an AIMLEA member.
 
 "This has armed law-enforcing agencies to harass us," says Fauzan Alvi, the association's member secretary. Alvi says legal and mechanized meat houses consume only unproductive buffalos, which is legal and allowed for over 45 years.
