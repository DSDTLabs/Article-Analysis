HYDERABAD: With the   in the country looking up and   heating up as a large number of companies expand their presence or foray into the state, the   is seeing  , especially in the  , say experts. 

 Apart from established players like Hyderabad-based Gati Ltd, e-commerce players such as Amazon, Flipkart and BigBasket have been steadily expanding their warehousing capacities in the city to meet the rising demand of the local population.
 
 Earlier this week, Amazon announced that it has increased its fulfilment centres/warehouses in the state from two in 2016 to five this year. These centres are spread in and around Hyderabad in places such as Pinjarla village, Kompally, Tolichowki and Medchal.
 
 CBRE South Asia Pvt Ltd executive director (industrial and logistics services, India) Jasmine Singh said t that one of the major reasons for the growth of the sector is the sea change in the demographics over the last few years.
 
 "Hyderabad was a market that was traditionally doing a 25,000 sft to 70,000 sft per warehouse around eight years ago as it was not a very large consumption centre. But because of the growth of the IT sector, the city has become a major consumption market... as the propensity of being able to buy expensive products offline as well as online has increased. As a result of this, the typical size of warehouses has gone up to 1-2.5 lakh sft," Singh said.
 
 Shekhar Bhende, co-founder, Lynk Logistics (a Ramco group-backed Chennai-based truck aggregator startup) said that Hyderabad is a radial city, where there are many dense business areas. "Unlike Chennai, where there are a few sources of pick-ups and many drop locations, in Hyderabad the pickup and drop locations are more or less even, allowing for higher utilisation of vehicles. This is one of the advantages for the logistics sector," he explained.
