GURUGRAM: Four sharpshooters of slain gangster   were sent to judicial custody in   after being produced before a city court on Friday. The move has further heightened the chances of a gang war taking place on the jail premises as members of Gadoli’s gang as well as gangster Binder Gujjar’s gang are lodged there together. 

 Police commissioner   has already put jail authorities on alert and asked them to ensure no untoward incident takes place in the premises. 
 
 Gurugram police had taken the four accused in transit remand from Rohtak police on January 24 for three days, who were arrested for their involvement in the murder of Gujjar’s brother Manish.
