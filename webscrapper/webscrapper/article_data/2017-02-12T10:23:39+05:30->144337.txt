BADAUN: Taking a dig at  's "kaam bolta hai (work speaks)" slogan, prime minister   at a rally in Badaun on Saturday said it was the SP leader's "karnama" (misdeeds) which speak for him. The PM said that all heinous crimes, including rape, riots and murder, are committed in UP and a woman is raped every hour in the state. "When Akhilesh say kaam bolta hai, each child of UP knows iska karnama bol raha hai (his misdeeds are speaking for him).

 Speaking about the results of the MLC elections of Bareilly-Moradabad, Gorakhpur-Faizabad and Kanpur, Modi said, "All the three seats have been won by BJP with huge margin. As I announce this result, I promise that on this same day and same time after a month (March 11), it will be declared that BJP has formed the government in UP." 
 
  Commenting on the surgical strike, Modi said that scientists in India have developed a missile which can blow up enemy's missile 150 km above the ground. Modi said other parties will again seek proof of it and if you (they) want proof, they should come up in the sky.
 
 Modi claimed that 18,000 villages in the country are caught in a time wrap and people are still living in the 18th century in absence of electricity. Of these villages, 1,500 are in UP, he said.
