Hyderabad: City-based   Power and Infrastructure Ltd (GVKPIL) on Thursday informed the bourses that it has exited Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) by selling its residual 10% stake in the airport project to the Prem Watsa-led Fairfax India Holdings Corporation (Fairfax India) for Rs 1,290 crore.

 In March-end 2017, GVKPIL completed the sale of 33% stake in Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) to Fairfax India for Rs 2,202 crore but retained 10% stake and the management of BIAL. GVK group held the stake in BIAL through its subsidiary Bangalore Airport Infrastructure Developers Private Limited (BAIDPL).
 
 Subsequently, in June 2017, GVK announced its decision to conclude the sale of this 10% residual stake to Fairfax India, subject to necessary consents and approvals. 
 
 Commenting on the exit from Bengalauru airport, GVK Reddy, founder chairman and managing director, GVK Group said, “Since de-leveraging is currently our top priority, we decided to part ways with BIAL. However, we would like to reiterate that the airports sector will continue to be a core focus area for GVK. We will now focus on Mumbai as well as the Navi Mumbai airport, for which we have won the bid and also on selectively evaluating privatisation opportunities. Capacity optimisation and real estate development will now be our priority areas for the existing Mumbai airport.”
