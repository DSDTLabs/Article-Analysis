Panaji: The state government appears to be on the backfoot, as the state election commission (SEC) has stated that all panchayat elections have to be conducted under its supervision, direction and control, from electoral roll preparation to declaration of results, as per Article 243K of the Constitution.

 The additional affidavit was filed by SEC secretary Darshana Narulkar before the high court of Bombay at Goa in a public interest litigation, stating that SEC is vested with powers for delimitation and reservation of wards being now done by directorates of panchayats and municipal administration.
 
 The affidavit support the argument of petitioner Mango Foundation, challenging the delimitation of wards and reservation by both directorates.
 
 Based on a draft of ‘Model Panchayat and Gram Swaraj Act’, circulated by the Union ministry in a letter dated April 27, 2009, various states including Kerala, Maharashtra, and Karnataka have effected necessary changes. 
 
 But the necessary amendments have not been carried out to the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 even despite several reminders, including one by then minister for panchayat raj, Mani Shankar Aiyer, the affidavit states.
 
 The SEC secretary said the legislature of a state might, by law, make provision related to all matters of panchayat elections, subject to the provisions of this Constitution. 
 
 “In case, the powers as regards to delimitation of wards, reservation of seats, rotation of reserved seats and declaration of dates of elections continue to be vested in the state government, the same would defeat the very purpose of the 73rd and the 74th amendment to the Constitution of India, providing for a mechanism to timely hold free and fair elections to the local bodies,” the SEC affidavit stated.
 
 As per the 73rd (1993) amendment to the Constitution, the states have to enforce requisite amendments to the provisions of law, relating to panchayats within one year.
