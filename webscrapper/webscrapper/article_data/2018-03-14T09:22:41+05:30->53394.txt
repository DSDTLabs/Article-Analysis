AURANGABAD: Omprakash Varma, an expert member of transportation sector sub-committee of  , who had stepped down recently from his post to protest alleged official apathy towards the statutory body, has been asked to reconsider his decision. 

 Aurangabad district collector Naval  , in a letter addressed to Varma has also informed that his resignation has been rejected by the Board.
 
 "Your resignation was discussed during a meeting of the Board. We arrived at a decision that your services are valuable considering your experience and role in pursuing railway related issues," Ram stated in the letter. 
 
 In the resignation letter submitted in January, Varma had expressed strong displeasure over non appointment of full-time head for   Development Board for considerable time, among other issues. Stating that it was irony that state government could not find any competent individual across eight districts of the region to head the responsibility of Marathwada Development Board, Varma in his resignation had also criticised Chief Minister   for allegedly not giving time to meet to discuss issues related to the Board since past two years. 
 
 When contacted, Varma said that he has decided to hold the post concerned for now in the wake of request made by authorities. "The Board was formed to help Marathwada in overcoming developmental and other backlogs. It is unfortunate that the statutory body has almost become nobody's child in recent past. However, we still have hopes from the government and seek its help in making the Board a powerful means to alter the face of Marathwada," he said. 
 
 Established along with two other development boards (Vidarbha and Rest of Maharashtra) on May 1,1994, Marathwada Development Board has been functioning without a full-time president for almost seven years now, including last three year rule of  . The term of all these boards has been extended up to April 30,2020 by a Presidential order.
