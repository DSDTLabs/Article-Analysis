On Valentine’s Day, most Delhiites go on romantic dates either to the movies, or to a fancy restaurant. But for the elite party-goers of the capital, for several years now, February 14 has meant participating in a ‘ritual’– attending the annual Valentine’s Day bash hosted by author and former diplomat   at his residence. This year’s party saw a confluence of diplomats, businessmen, designers, artists, amidst a whole range of Delhi’s crème de la crème, all dressed in red and black, the dress code for the evening. Almost all the guests let their hair loose and took to the dance floor, shaking their legs to the choicest musical hits from the ‘60s and ‘70s. "The entire ambience of the party – particularly the love in the air, the warmth among the guests, and the red and black theme – makes it so alluring," said Shivani Chaudhary, a guest.

 The evening has been a highlight on Delhi’s party calendar for years. Gudmundur Eiriksson, former Ambassador of Iceland to India, said, "This is my eighth time at this party so I am sort of a veteran here. I met Bhaichand over 40 years ago when we worked at the UN and about a decade ago, we reconnected and since then, I have been a regular. This is the most fun night of the year in Delhi." Talking about what motivated him to host his annual Valentine’s Day soiree, the host told us, "I don’t have any family within a thousand mile radius so I celebrate this day with my friends. This is my Delhi family and I choose to have them with me on the loveliest evening of the year."
