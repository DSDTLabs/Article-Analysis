COIMBATORE: Sending out a strong message to those failing to abide by tax laws, the Income Tax (I-T) Department has this year initiated criminal prosecution in 21 cases of non-compliance. 

 “The main offence is non-filing of tax returns by those who are liable to do so. Other offences include tax evasion and failure to make tax payments,” said the I-T department, adding that more such cases were under the process of filing. Of the cases filed in February, 13 cases are from Coimbatore,   and   districts. 
 
 Till date, about 82,899 new taxpayers have filed their returns and the number is expected to cross a lakh, a press statement from the I-T department said. The returns for the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17 could still be filed on or before March 31. The I-T department has also advised the defaulters to use the opportunity and file the returns.
