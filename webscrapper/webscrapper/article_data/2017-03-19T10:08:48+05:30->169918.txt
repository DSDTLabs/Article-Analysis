AGARTALA: The Left Front government in Tripura called a dawn-to-dusk general strike in Sabroom on Saturday in protest against the alleged killing of three civilians along the India-Bangladesh border by personnel of the   (BSF) on Friday. 

 Two others sustained injuries but no arrests have been made so far.
 
 The BSF has ordered an inquiry into the incident, even as Union home minister   sought a detailed report from the force.
 
 The incident has sparked outrage in the state that shares a long international border with Bangladesh. While the paramilitary force said its jawans acted in self-defence after facing an attack from cattle smugglers, the government, backed by Tripura Police, dismissed such claims.
 
 The BSF said its jawans received intelligence that a 40-member group of smugglers would approach the border with a large number of cattle. Assistant sub-inspector of BSF,  , and constable Rabi Dutta went to seize the cattle but, on reaching the spot, found themselves under attack. "As an act of self-defence, BSF personnel opened six rounds of fire that led to the deaths," the paramilitary force said.
 
 Tripura Police, however, said initial investigation showed all three victims were shot in the head and other parts of the body. The nature of the injuries did not support BSF's self-defence claim, they said.
 
 The CPM further claimed that three jawans tried to rape a tribal woman on her way back from work at Chittabari and opened fired when a group of villagers tried to rescue her.
 
 The deceased have been identified as Suralaxmi Tripura (20),   (38) and Padma Kumar Tripura (37). The injured are  , 33, and Jiban Tripura, 22.
 
 IGP (law and order) KV Sreejesh said police was investigating the case and the accused would be arrested soon.
