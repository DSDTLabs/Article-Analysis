LUDHIANA: The Jagraon-Moga road, which saw a fatal accident on Thursday in which a high court lawyer from Chandigarh, his wife and son were killed and his maid was seriously injured, has turned into a  .

 In the past two years, at least nine persons have died in accidents on the stretch.
 
 In November, three persons had died after the MUV they were travelling in from Haridwar collided with a stationary truck near a gurdwara, almost at the same spot where the accident happened on Thursday. Police officials said one of the wheels of the truck had got punctured and the indicator of the vehicle was not working at the time of accident.
 
 In August 2015, three persons including two women had died after a luxury bus hit their bike near the gurdwara. Whereas the motorcyclist   died on the spot, his wife   and relative   succumbed to injuries later at a private hospital in Ludhiana.
 
 Road safety experts said there are many reasons for the accidents on the road.
 
 “The road has not been fully constructed. Its work has been going on for a long time. The completed portion of the road has not been done as per Indian Road Congress Standards which might be a reason for tyre bursts and punctures,” said road safety expert Kamaljeet Soi. He said police are also to be blamed for the mess as they merely challan traffic violators instead of managing and regulating traffic.
