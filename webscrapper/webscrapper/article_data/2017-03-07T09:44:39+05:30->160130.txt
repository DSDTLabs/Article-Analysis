 Pawan Kumar, territory manager (LPG), BPCL, told TOI that approximately 50,000 cylinders were pushed to the Pune market on March 5 from the company’s Shikrapur LPG plant. “The situation should normalise within a few days as we plan to dispatch similar number of LPG cylinders daily to clear the backlog of orders,” he said.
 
 Kumar said that BPCL’s Shikrapur LPG plant is now operating round the clock to meet the backlog. “Earlier, the bottling plant would operate in two shifts — from 7 am to 3 pm and 3 pm to 11 pm.

We have a bottling plant in Uran near Panvel, from where we are sourcing around 5,000 cylinders daily for Pune market. All of this is expected to create ample supply of LPG cylinders in the Pune market during the next few days,” said Kumar.

 A top source from the  , said, “Normal cylinder supply to distributors resumed from Monday. If the supply continues to be constant and smooth, it will take around three days to meet the pending backlog of consumer orders.”
