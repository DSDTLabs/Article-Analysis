New Delhi: BJP on Sunday asked Congress leadership to sack Virbhadra Singh as Himachal chief minister after the Delhi high court refused to quash the ongoing DA case against the latter. 

 In a press conference, BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP, Bhupendra Yadav, asked Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to sack Virbhadra. “If he is not sacked, Congress will be understood as a habitual patron of the corrupt, not taking lessons after recent poll drubbings following scams in the UPA dispensation,” he said. 
 
 “The high court has categorically observed that the ongoing probe against Virbhadra is not politically motivated and that there is no reason to restrain the CBI from the ongoing probe,” said Yadav to put forth his point that the claims made by the Himachal chief minister were ungrounded. 
 
 He said Virbhadra, as a Union minister in 2010-11, had got his black money converted through questionable transactions inviting probe by authorities. “Investigations found he had a profit of Rs 6 crore from apple farming in one year and the said apples were transported by vehicles like scooters. That shows gross irregularities and makes evident of foul play,” Yadav said. tnn
