JAIPUR: Following the allotment of an area, the Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation ( ) on Monday started operating its super luxury buses from Maharana Pratap Bus Terminal, Kashmiri Gate in Delhi also known as ISBT.

 Supreme Court citing air pollution as the reason had asked the RSRTC not to ply their buses from the   close to India Gate. Thereafter, RSRTC had asked the government of Delhi to allot them a proper place at the ISBT, Kashmiri Gate in Delhi.
 
 Initially, the RSRTC management after the court orders had stopped operating their buses from the Bikaner House, but they were not been able to get a proper place for their buses.
 
 “We have stopped operating our buses from the Bikaner House earlier after the directions of the Supreme Court. From 6 pm onwards on Monday, we had started operating our buses from the AC depot of the ISBT, Kashmiri gate,” said Sudhir Bhati, manager (public relations), RSRTC while talking to TOI.
 
 CMD, RSRTC, Rajhans Upadhyay, said that the official orders in this regard were already been issued. “We have also directed chief managers, delux depot, Jaipur and Delhi to ensure following of this system from today onwards,” he said in a statement.
 
 RSRTC officials further stated that the places including ISBT, Kaley Khan, Dhola Kaun, IFFCO Chowk (Gurgaon) are marked as the halts to carry the passengers. “The ISBT, Delhi also has a good connectivity with the Delhi metro from every direction. This will also facilitate the passengers to have a direct connectivity of the buses to other states,” said an officer.
 
 At least 26 super luxury buses are operating between Jaipur and Delhi. “Super luxury buses are quite popular and they are the profitable venture for the RSRTC. Since the confusion is now clear the passengers load in these buses will certain get increased,” said Baldev Singh, a Jaipur based tour operator.
