BENGALURU: Police have launched a manhunt for two bike-borne miscreants who attacked a 20-year-old student of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology while she was walking towards her home in Yelahanka New Town on Saturday night. The institution said poor lighting of roads in the area has left its wards in a vulnerable position.

 Yelahanka New Town police said they have collected   footages from nearby commercial shops and also  , which is located at the end of the road where the girl was attacked around 9.30pm.
 
 “Narendra Raghunath, a faculty from Srishti, filed a complaint with us on Saturday night. The miscreants touched her inappropriately while the bike was moving and she fell on the road,” a police officer said.
 
 Police initially filed a non-cognizance report (NCR) and asked the complainant to get the girl to record her statement. “We will register an FIR against the miscreants and slap a sexual harassment case under Section 354 of IPC (outraging modesty) based on her statement,” police said.
 
 Two months ago, two bike-borne miscreants had attacked another student of the same institution; they slapped one of the two girls walking on the road. The girls provided the details of the bike along with their complaint, but it was found that the registration number belonged to a vehicle that had been scrapped 10 years ago.
 
 “Such incidents continue to be a social menace. This should not happen. We don’t take such cases lightly. Streetlights are not working properly in the vicinity of the college and this has been brought to the notice of authorities. There’s a need to increase police patrolling in this area. We’ve brought this to the notice of police. They are also vigilant,” said Geetha Narayanan, Founder and director, Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology.
 
 Police said they have increased night patrolling in the area. On Sunday, extra personnel were deployed and barricades erected in Yelahanka New Town as a preventive measure.
