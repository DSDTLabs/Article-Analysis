 Jigyasa Singh, who became a household name as Thapki, a cheerful girl with a stutter, in ' ', will soon be seen on Season Two of the TV show Dev, which will be a breakaway from her last fiction outing. The sari-clad bahu in 'Thapki...' will make way for a young and spunky journalist on 'Dev 2'. Says a source associated with the show, “Jigyasa will play a 21-year-old SoBo girl, fresh out of college, who falls head over heels for Dev (Ashish Chowdhry), which will lead to a love triangle between her, him and Mehek (Puja Banerjee).”
 
 
 
 The mythological show ' ', which launched in November 2016, will end on March 9. The show took a time leap in October last year, which marked the reunion of the former co-actors Rohit Khurana and Tinaa Dattaa. While Rohit played the grown-up Shani, Tinaa played his love interest, Dhamini. Producer Siddharth Kumar Tewary confirms, “Shani' was a finite series, which was, in fact, extended. It’s still doing well on the ratings chart. However, rather than dragging it on, we want to end it on a high note.”
