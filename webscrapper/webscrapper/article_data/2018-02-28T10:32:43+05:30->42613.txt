TRICHY: Under the national horticulture mission, the district horticulture department has taken up a project of creating 27 water sources across the district. The total cost of building a water source will be Rs 1.50 lakh, out of which the government will provide Rs 75,000 as subsidy.

 As beneficiaries have already been identified, the work for the creation of water sources has begun, officials from the horticulture department said. At a time when the entire state is struggling to get water to irrigate crops, this would minimise the water requirement considerably, they added.
