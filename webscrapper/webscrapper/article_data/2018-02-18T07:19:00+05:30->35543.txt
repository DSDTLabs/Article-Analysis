Ludhiana: Putting behind financial constraints, Binod Rajak, 16, a product of Ludhiana Basketball Academy (LBA), has made it the camp for the selection of the India junior basketball team for the forthcoming FIBA Under-16 Asian Basketball Championship to be held at Dalang (in China) in March.

 A son of taxi driver, Binod originally belongs to West Bengal. He is among 15 hoopsters from across the country who have been selected for the camp. Prince Pal who was a part of the Indian team in last year’s Junior FIBA Asian Basketball Championship, is another players from the Ludhiana Basketball Academy.
 
 Binod recently helped Punjab secure the title in Junior Youth National Basketball Championship held in Hyderabad.
 
 Binod also played an important role in Punjab basketball team’s title victory over Delhi in the Khelo India games, recently held in Delhi.
 
 Getting training at Ludhiana Basketball Academy for the past one year, he said, “I did not give despite several financial constraints in my career. I have proved by capabilities in Khelo India games and youth national basketball championship.”
 
 “My father is a taxi driver in Kolkata. I came to Ludhiana Basketball Academy as I lacked resources to fulfil my dream of becoming international basketball players like Satnam Singh Bhamra and Amjyot Singh,” he added.
 
 “I came to know about the Ludhiana Basketball Academy in 2016 as it’s famous across the country because of its contribution to the Indian basketball.”
 
 “The India camp will be held in Bangalore in March,” said Rajak.
