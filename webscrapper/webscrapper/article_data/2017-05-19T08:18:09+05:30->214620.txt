CHENNAI: The   on Thursday ordered the   (TNSCB) to submit a detailed report on the threat to life posed to dwellers of slum board tenements in   constituency.

 Taking suo motu cognisance of a TOI report dated May 18 “Aging slum board flats in Egmore pose life threat“, which appeared in the Chennai edition, the commission issued notice to the managing director of the TNSCB.
 
 It directed the slum clearance board to submit a detailed report on the matter within a period of six weeks, following which the case will be taken up for hearing. The commission warned that “fit and proper“ action would be taken in the event of non-submission of the report by the TNSCB.
 
 On Thursday, TOI reported that slum board tenements in Egmore are on the threshold of collapsing due to years of non-maintenance. Responding to TOI's query, TNSCB officials said that they needed to collect Rs 250 per month as maintenance fee from the dwellers, most of whom are daily wagers, in order to improve upkeep standards.
 
 A glaring factor in the issue was that the state government's housing policy guidelines is not clear on who is responsible for loss of human lives, in the event of an accident caused due to negligent maintenance.
