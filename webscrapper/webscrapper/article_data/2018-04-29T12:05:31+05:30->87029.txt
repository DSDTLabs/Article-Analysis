HYDERABAD: Animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav on Saturday took umbrage to TPCC president   Reddy’s comments against CM KCR’s family. “Uttam Kumar says there is only KCR’s family rule in Telangana. KTR, Harish Rao and   have all been in the forefront of Telangana agitation and were elected by the people. He dare not make such remarks,” he warned.

 “Uttam and his wife   are both MLAs, then how can he point fingers at others. It is Congress which has been in the grip of Gandhi family for ages,” he said. The minister also took potshots at Congress leaders’ bus yatra. “Out of 30 Congressmen in the bus, 16 are CM candidates. This is how hungry they are for power,” he said.
 
 TRS MLCs Karne Prabhakar and Shamipur Raja, TSIIC chairman   and TRS secretary   said: “When PV Narasimha Rao became PM, every Telugu man was happy. Why is Congress unable to digest KCR’s entry into national politics.”
