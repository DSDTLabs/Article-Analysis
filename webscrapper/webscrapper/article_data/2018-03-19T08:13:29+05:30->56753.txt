HYDERABAD : The four fatal accidents that took place over this weekend in the  , have taken the total number of fatal accidents this year in the Cyberabad limits to 40.

 
 The Cyberabad   have recorded over 300 accidents in the IT corridor in first two months of this year, with most of the accidents taking place on the weekends.
 
 
 As roads are congested in the city during the day, most accidents take place during the night when the streets are relatively empty.
 
 
 “There is no traffic restriction during the night because of which people tend to overspeed, causing accidents. Most of the junctions during night do not have traffic police. People drive in opposite direction of the  , jump traffic signals and do not wear helmets during this time,” said S Jayaram, assistant commissioner of police (Traffic), Cyberabad.
 
 
 According to the traffic police, most victims of accidents are pedestrians and motorcyclists, who are hit by heavy vehicles or four-wheelers. Over-speeding and rash driving remain the primary reasons behind such incidents taking place.

Commuters violate traffic rules more often during night, which make them vulnerable to accidents,” said road safety expert,  , founder of the Indian Federation of Road Safety. He said while overspeeding leads to maximum number of accidents, traffic police have failed to put in place adequate measures to curb such cases inside the city limit.
