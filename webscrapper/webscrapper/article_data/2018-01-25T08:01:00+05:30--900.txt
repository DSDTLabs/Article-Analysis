Noida: The new   of Uttar Pradesh will help end the   system “created to help a particular company,” UP excise minister said on Wednesday.

 Jai Pratap Singh, UP minister of excise and prohibition ,who was on a visit to the district for the inauguration of projects on UP Diwas, said that the policy has been completely done away with the excise policy for 2018-19 and the entire application process has been brought online.
 
 He said the system of monopoly, which had been created due to the special zone which was formed by the-then government in 2009 “to help a particular company has now been done away with completely.” Singh, however, did not mention the name of any company .
 
 “The process has been brought on a digital platform with an online application process and e-auction. One person will be able to take maximum two outlets in a district and everything will happen via e-auction. The old system will remain in place till March 31 by which time, we will bring in the new system,” he said after the inaugural function at the Mahamaya Balika Inter College, Sector 44.
 
 The new system will be for both the wholesale and retail shops and all the old contracts will end, he said.
 
 The UP excise policy 2018-19 which was approved by the cabinet on Tuesday night has finished the special Meerut excise zone comprising western UP divisions of Meerut, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Bareilly divisions which was apparently meant to benefit a particular group, which was virtually awarded all the wholesale and retail shops in the region. The zone was created in 2009 by the then Mayawati government.
 
 The important NCR districts fall under the Meerut division. Along with the provision for one individual to buy maximum two liquor shops, the policy provides for online payment facility via channels like debit and credit cards, e-wallets, etc.
