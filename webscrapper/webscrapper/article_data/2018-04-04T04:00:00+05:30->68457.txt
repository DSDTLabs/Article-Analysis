Rajkot: A noted chartered accountant (CA) in Bhavnagar died after falling from the terrace of his office building on Tuesday.

 CA Pramod Hemani (75), came to his office at around 11am and told the peon that he was going to the washroom. However, he went straight to the terrace on the fifth floor. Suddenly, people heard a loud noise. They found Hemani lying in a pool of blood on the ground below.
 
 Police said they have not yet ascertained whether it was an accident or Hemani had committed suicide. People working at his office told police that in the winters, Hemani would frequently go on the terrace for 15-20 minutes and then return. But they were surprised as to why he went up there in the scorching heat. 
 
 Police said that three years ago, Hemani had suffered a paralysis attack. However, he got cured later. His son Prashant is also a practising CA in Ahmedabad.
 
 Hemani is one of the most prominent CAs in Bhavnagar and runs a firm named PG Hemani & Co. He has an office in Turning Point Complex on Vaghvadi Road and stayed in Tilaknagar plot.
