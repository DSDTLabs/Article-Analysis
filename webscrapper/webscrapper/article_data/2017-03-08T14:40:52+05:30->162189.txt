CHENNAI: A speech delivered by former   chief minister J   in 2009 praising O   was played repeatedly at his   venue in Egmore here on Wednesday enthusing his supporters.

 The 
  in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu demanding a CBI probe into the events at her Poes Garden residence prior to her hospitalisation on September 22 last year. 
 
 In her speech delivered during a family function of Panneerselvam at Periyakulam in 2009, Jayalalithaa had recalled OPS’s rise from an ordinary cadre to the level of a minister and later chief minister. She had wanted the youth and others who joined the party to be patient and work sincerely for the party.
 
  
  
 
 The speech was first played in parts when his supporters started coming to the fast venue in the morning. Once the crowd swelled and all available chairs were occupied, former AIADMK legislator JCD Prabhakar said, “Wait for an important announcement and please don’t shout.” 
 
 Soon the entire speech was relayed and the OPS supporters went into a frenzy. 
 
 “I have searched to find a person who has returned kingship just like Panneerselvam did. (Panneerselvam resigned from the chief minister’s post in 2002 after the Supreme Court acquitted her in Tansi case). But I could find such a person only in the Ramayana where Bharata gave back the kingship to Lord Rama when the latter returned to Ayodhya from forest,” said Jayalalithaa. 
 
 The organisers stopped the speech for Panneerselvam supporters to express their emotions. Many of them started abusing AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and her family members. Some started to cry.
 
 Apparently, Sasikala also attended the 2009 Panneerselvam family function where Jayalalithaa delivered the speech praising him. In a video of the function, Sasikala can be seen sitting among the audience listening to Jayalalithaa’s speech.
