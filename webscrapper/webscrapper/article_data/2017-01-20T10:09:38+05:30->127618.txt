AHMEDABAD: Exactly 154 years ago today, the first   on the  . The link was constructed by the Bombay, Baroda and   (BB&CI) and was flagged off on January 20, 1863 from Kalupur, some 10 years after the first railways came to India.

 The original location of Kalupur station has been shifted, as gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge took place in the 1960s. The Surat-Ahmedabad rail route, linking the two Gujarat cities to Bombay, had fuelled the rise of the mills in the state. Almost one year earlier, in April 1862, the British government had started negotiations with locals for constructing a station and declared it would lay two roads, which include the present-day Relief Road which directly connected the station to Teen Darwaza. The other road was Astodia Road.
 
 “The   in India had travelled between Mumbai and Thane on April 16, 1853. The powerful Mahajan community campaigned for a separate line for Ahmedabad, and thus put the city on the railway map of the country. The first train from the city to Surat was flagged off in1863 from the newly built Kalupur railway station,” says city based historian Rizwan Kadri.
 
 Such was the pressure to construct the railway in a short deadline, that the British government issued a public notice that the BB&CI required stones meant for the Kankaria lake renovation worth Rs 16,000 for the construction of the Kalupur station and for laying the rail line. Residents had protested as they claimed this would destroy the lake and the project would involve demolitions. But local community leaders were roped in to convince the people. “The collector issued a notification and mentioned that if Amdavadis wanted to renovate Kankaria lake, they should demonstrate their intent by organizing a fund-collection drive,” says Kadri. The BB&CI was finally allowed to use the stones meant for the Kankaria renovation. Originally, the Kankaria renovation funds were collected via the fort wall maintenance tax—present day octroi.
