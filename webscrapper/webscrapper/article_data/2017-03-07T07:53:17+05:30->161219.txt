CHENNAI: Demanding that cab fares be fixed by the state and decrying the   of cab aggregators, hundreds of cab drivers in the city have gone on a two-day strike from Monday. The drivers, who have tied up with private aggregators like   and  , boycotted roads, particularly in the north and central parts of the city, as a mark of protest. 

 While fares were the central point of discussion, the drivers also touched on the alleged unfair practices followed by these companies due to which they were insufficiently compensated. For Uber drivers, the very low per kilometre base fare was a source of discontent. "Even autos running at 12 per kilometre claim it's not feasible to ply at these prices. With the recent hike in the price of fuel, how can cabs ply for 6 per kilometre for single rides, and 3 for shared rides," asked B Anbazhagan, general secretary of the  . 
 
 While autos have a base charge and a per kilometre ride cost specified by the government, no such regulations are in place for cabs, he points out. 
 
 Meanwhile, Ola drivers were cut up over the extremely high commission rates. "Many drivers, who are promised attractive incentives for completing a specific quota of trips every day, do not get enough ride requests to earn their incentive," said Anbazhagan, who added that that up to 30% of a driver's earnings are taken by the companies. 
 
 "The commissions are very steep. Owners also have to cover fuel and driver wages after giving away so much in commission. The government must introduce specific fare guidelines to put a check on this," he adds. The association will be presenting a draft with specific demands to the state transport department.
 
 "Cabs were plying around the IT corridor in the city and parts of south Chennai. But in areas like Thiruvottiyur, Perambur and Egmore, drivers kept off the roads," said Ganesh, an Ola driver.
