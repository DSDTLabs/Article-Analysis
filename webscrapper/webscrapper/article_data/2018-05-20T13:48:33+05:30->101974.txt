TRICHY: The health department has urged doctors in the private sector, individual practitioners and pharmacies to help raise the tuberculosis notification rate. Various sensitisation programmes held across Trichy district in the last two years have helped raise TB reporting, say health department officials.

 Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri claimed that the TB notification rate from the private sector for this quarter so far in 2018 has been at 40.6 % . “The notification rate in Trichy district has been good this year, but we are striving to increase the rate to 60%,” she told TOI. “ Notification from the private sector can help us understand the trend of the disease in a more efficient way so that better care can be given to the patients,” she added.
 
 A tuberculosis awareness meeting, headed by district collector K Rajamani, was held at the collectorate recently, in which health department officials, private practitioners and pharmacists participated. During the programme, private practitioners were urged to notify all TB cases to the health department and the pharmacists were asked to make an entry of TB medicines sold to patients in Schedule H1 register and submit the information to the department.
 
 The notifications and details are stored in the secure software NIKSHAY, which was introduced by the central government a few years ago to keep track of TB patients across the country. Based on the notification, the patients – if they are willing – are visited by health department staff, who would give them treatment, motivation and counselling. Apart from this, early detection of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) would be done for the patients through universal drug sensitivity test, and they are given corresponding treatment. As part of encouraging doctors to notify TB cases regularly, annual awards were also being given away by the health department, over the past two years.
