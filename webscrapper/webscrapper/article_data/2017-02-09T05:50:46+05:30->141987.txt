KOCHI:   for Startups at Mattakkara in Kottayam has approached the   challenging the technical university's decision not to grant affiliation to it from the next academic year. 

 In the petition, it is demanded that the   (APJAKTU) decision should be quashed.
 
 The decision not to grant affiliation was taken after considering the report of an inquiry conducted by university officials following several complaints regarding violation of AICTE and university guidelines that were received by the state government and the university from students and parents.
 
 It was noted in the inquiry report that the college is functioning in a building situated around 1km away from the location where the college was supposed to be functioning as per the university records.
