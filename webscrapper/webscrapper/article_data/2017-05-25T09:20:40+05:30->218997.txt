LUCKNOW: Will   of Secondary Education, Asia’s biggest, do away with the   policy? Top officials in the department said they are waiting for the   ( ) to decide whether class X and XII students are given grace marks in exams for difficult questions or errors in the question paper or not. Close to 55 lakh students appeared for the UP Board examinations this year. 

 “We are not sure whether moderation policy for state board students will apply this year or not as we are still in the process of feeding data while CBSE is about to declare results so we will follow whatever CBSE decides,” UPBSE secretary Shail Yadav told TOI, adding that a meeting of all state board officials with CBSE was held in April last year to discuss whether moderation policy in board exams should continue or not.
 
 The Delhi high court on Tuesday prohibited CBSE from scrapping its moderation policy in evaluating classes X and XII board students’ papers this year. Exam results are expected in a few days. While taking the decision, the high court stressed on the point that “no one can play with the lives and future of children”. 
 
 The moderation policy in UP Board, said Yadav, changes every year. Moderation refers to manipulation of marks from the total score of students either subject-wise or result-wise, she added. 
 
 UP Board officials said they have written to the CBSE chairman requesting him to take a call on moderation in order to help students compete with their CBSE counterparts in competitive exams and also in college admissions.
