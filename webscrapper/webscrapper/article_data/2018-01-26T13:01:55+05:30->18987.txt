 DEHRADUN: A day after TOI reported that   (GDMCH) has asked patients covered under a state government health insurance scheme to get their own implants if they need surgery, the hospital administration announced that it would be providing free implants for the surgeries.
  
  The surgical implants are provided for free under the   ( ) which caters to 12.5 lakh families that are either Below Poverty Line (BPL) or non-tax payers. Beneficiaries can avail themselves of cashless treatment up to Rs 1.75 lakh under the insurance scheme. But patients who visited the hospital this week were in for a shock when they were asked by the hospital staff to get operated “only if they could bear the cost of implants that are required”.
  
  A highly placed source at the hospital had told TOI that the decision was taken since the health department had failed to pay dues amounting to Rs 80 lakh for previous surgeries conducted under MSBY since August 2017. The source added that the private insurance company which was providing health cover to MSBY beneficiaries before August 2017 also has to pay pending dues of Rs 1.86 crore. After August 2017, the health department formed a state nodal agency to carry out the insurance scheme and provide the cover.
  
  After the TOI report, the health department sought details of pending bills from the MSBY unit of the hospital. According to TOI sources, in a meeting at GDMCH, the private insurance company has agreed to pay Rs 73 lakh while the state nodal agency of MSBY will pay Rs 37 lakh to the hospital.
  
  GDMCH’s MSBY nodal officer, Dr N S Khatri, told TOI, “The meeting concluded on a positive note as we shall be getting at least 50% of the dues on priority. We will ask the supplier to resume providing implants to the hospital after assuring him of payment within a week.”
  
    of Dehradun, Dr Y S Thapliyal, added, “We have directed the hospital’s nodal agency official to ensure that free implants are given to all MSBY beneficiaries.”
