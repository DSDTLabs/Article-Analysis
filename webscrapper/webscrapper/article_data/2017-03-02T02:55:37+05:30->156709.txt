Noida: A   worker was arrested for protesting outside the district magistrate’s residence in Sector 27 on Wednesday. Shivam Gehlot protested outside the DM’s   alleging that minister of state (tourism and culture) Mahesh Sharma had abused and assaulted him on Tuesday, following a spat with a doctor at  , which is owned by Sharma.

 Anil Pratap Singh, SHO of Sector 20 police station, said there is enforcement of Section 144 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC across Noida till votes are counted for the constituency in the ongoing assembly elections. “Unlawful assembly is prohibited as per rule. Gehlot was sitting on protest without permission from police and administration. We arrested him for unlawful assembly under Section 151 of IPC,” he said.
 
 Gehlot, a longtime BJP worker, alleged Sharma thrashed him at 9pm on Monday, when he accompanied his friend   to the hospital after the latter’s son Ansh (10) started “frothing in his mouth”. He alleged the hospital’s child specialist Dr   (78) refused to examine Ansh, leading to a scuffle.
 
 Gehlot added that when the scuffle broke out, Sharma called him into his cabin and assaulted him. However, on Tuesday, the hospital administration filed a complaint with Sector 20 police, alleging that Gehlot had barged into Dr Pahva’s chamber with a pair of surgeon’s scissors and attacked him, and that he had destroyed hospital property, which was captured on CCTV. Later Gehlot filed a complaint against Sharma accusing him of assault.
 
 Dinesh Singh, SP (city) Noida said police are investigating both complaints. “We will take suitable action in the matter,” he said.
