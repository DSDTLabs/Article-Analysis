VARANASI:   Sandeep Das, whose collaboration with   ensemble 'Sing Me Home' won   category, shares a deep connection with Varanasi. 

 Das was a disciple of legendary tabla maestro Pandit Kishan Maharaj of Banaras Gharana and learnt tabla under his tutelage for over a decade in the guru-shishya parampara (ancient Indian tradition where the disciple goes and lives with his guru) and went on to become one of his favourite disciples.
 
 Das would travel from Patna to Banaras every Friday evening, stay overnight at his guru's home and then return on Sunday. He would never spend a single vacation at home. Later, his father was transferred to Varanasi. He learnt lessons of life from his guru - doing the smallest jobs perfectly, how to focus and be disciplined, give attention to details and never imitate but create something of your own.
 
 Under his Guru's guidance, Sandeep debuted on stage with legendary sitar maestro Pt. Ravi Shankar and also won the national drumming championship thrice, becoming the youngest drummer to be graded by All-India Radio (AIR).
 
 Das had graduated in English literature with gold medal from Banaras Hindu University (BHU). 
 
 "It is a moment of pride for each and everyone at BHU. The foundation of the university was laid by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya with a vision that its students would make their mark on global platforms and the Grammy win is an example of it. The BHU family extends heartiest congratulations to Das for his achievement," BHU VC GC Tripathi said. 
 
 His Facebook timeline was flooded with best wishes from friends, fans and followers. Das kept his followers updated by sharing live videos from Grammy awards night, followed by news article on his Best World Music win. His wife Tripti Das also shared snapshots of her husband with the Yo-Yo Ma members along with 'Congratulations..so very proud of you'.
