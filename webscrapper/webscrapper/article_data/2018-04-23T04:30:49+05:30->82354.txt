MUMBAI: Tightening of coastal security after the 26/11 attacks doesn’t seem to have helped end oil smuggling, which was the mainstay of many yesteryear gangsters of Mumbai. The police have seized nearly 20,000 litres of diesel, worth nearly Rs 14 lakh, from two vessels in two different cases. Six persons have been arrested.

 
 What has baffled police is that in one of the cases, the barge had a licence to venture into sea to transport oil; only that MT   had permission to retrieve sludge oil, which is residual oil, from the rig.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 When the   police raided the barge anchored at   docks, they found 29,000 litres of sludge oil Rs 1.5 crore, and 11,000 litres of diesel worth around 7.7 lakh. Police arrested three people and are on the look out for three more: Akbar Pinjara, the owner of barge, and his two associates.
 
 A police officer said MT Farzana was hired by Meher Petro chemcials, which had the contract to remove sludge oil from the rig. While returning with sludge, the barge operators would buy diesel from foreign ships at throwaway prices. These diesel tanks were concealed between sludge tanks.
 
 ”We are exploring all possible angles,’’ said assistant commissioner of police(Port Zone)   who is heading the probe.
 
 Azaz Ansari, a representative of  , said, “We had given the contract to ferry the sludge oil. Our company has nothing to do with the diesel mafia.”  , advocate for the accused, said, “It’s a case of diesel theft, and police are giving a different colour.”
 
 Meanwhile, the   police on Sunday arrested three fishermen and seized 8,300 litres of diesel worth Rs5.8 lakh from their trawler. The accused had 22 hidden tanks fitted below false cavities.
