New Delhi: The   Association of Delhi College of Engineering (now Delhi Technological University or  ) has decided to raise funds for setting up rooms in the hostel for their alma mater and also launch merit-cum-means   for students. 

 This was decided during the annual general body meeting (GBM) and alumni meet held earlier this week. New governing body members were also elected at the meeting. Minister for human resource development Prakash Javadekar — through a video message — emphasised the role of alumni in improving the quality of education.
 
 Advocating increased role of alumni in the boards of educational institutions, like it is being done through the new IIM Bill whereby four alumni members have been appointed on the board of governors, Javadekar said that similar provisions can be made in IITs and other technology institutes.
 
 N K Sharma, re-elected general secretary of the association, said that the association has planned to “gift” some rooms in the hostel to the university and also start scholarships for students and the DTU alumni would raise funds for it.
 
 Fifteen toppers of each stream of engineering were conferred “meritorious student” award based on their academic performance up to pre-final year. Two of the superannuated professors — N K Jain and B D Pathak — were also honoured with “distinguished faculty” award.
