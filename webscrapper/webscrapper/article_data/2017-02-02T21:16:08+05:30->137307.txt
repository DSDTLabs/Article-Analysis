SURAT: Two bodies of around one-year-old female   were found from a river bed near Valod of   on Wednesday. On noticing the bodies villagers alerted   and later the bodies were sent for post mortem.
 
 Post mortem examination by veterinary doctor revealed that the leopard cubs could have died natural death. The doctor did not find any sign of injury or poisoning as it has been reported in some cases in past. Initially, it was suspected that death of two cubs together could be result of poisoning or attack by some human or other animal. However, the post mortem did not indicate anything suspicious.
  
 After the post mortem, the doctor estimated from condition of the body that the leopards have died three days before.
  
 “Two female leopard cubs were found dead near Valod and we have started investigation. The post mortem report did not indicate any unnatural cause of death and it seems that the cubs could have died on not getting enough food,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat.
  
 Forest officials believe that the cubs could have separated from mother leopard recently and later starved to death.
  
 In recent past bodies of young leopards have been found from Surat, Navsari and Valsad districts.
