BENGALURU: For more than a decade, Karnataka has pursued the disproportionate assets case, which was transferred to a court here in 2003. And now, the final verdict in the case could have an impact on the way Tamil Nadu's politics will play out following the leadership crisis in the AIADMK after former chief minister  's death.

 While there may have been an “indirect“ influence on TN politics following Karnataka's persistence with the case, advocate-general   said Karnataka had carried out the directions issued by the   and there was nothing more to it.
 
 “We were asked to prosecute the late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa and the other accused in the disproportionate assets case, and we did it successfully,“ Naik said.
 
 In June 2015, when the Karnataka government decided to appeal against the high court order acquitting Jayalalithaa, state law minister T B Jayachandra was clear in his message: “We are not indulging in vengeance politics. The decision to appeal against Jayalalithaa's acquittal is based purely on the legal merits of the case.“
 
 Now,   and the two others convicted in the case will be sentenced to jail in Bengaluru, most likely in Parappana Agrahara.
 
 Political observer and analyst   says the “indirect influence“ of Karnataka's actions on Tamil Nadu politics is quite visible and the large Tamil population in Karnataka is aware of it.
 
 “Most of my students have been following the case closely and are aware the impact the verdict could have on the politics in that state. Some students are of the opinion that O Panneerselvam may be easier to handle when it comes to the Cauvery river row than his predecessors,“ he said.
 
 Ramaswamy also said politicians in other parties had been keenly following the outcome of the case. “With demonetisation and I-T raids, every party has been watching this case to get a glimpse of what may happen in a disproportionate wealth case, including loopholes, if any, to exploit,“ he said.
