PUNE: Mayor   has asked the   to present funding details of its 24x7   supply project after opposition leaders questioned the civic body’s decision to raise funds from the stock market despite have substantial deposits in banks. 

 The PMC has deposits of Rs 1,450 crore in 343 banks across the city. It has allocated Rs 304 crore for the 24x7 water supply project. 
 
 “By floating bonds in the stock market, the PMC raised Rs 200 crore for the project. But why did the civic body opt for the stock market when it had funds available for the project?” asked senior Congress corporator, Ulhas alias  , while speaking to TOI on Saturday.
 
 PMC officials were unable to provide suitable exlanations when Bagul and other corporators presented their arguments against the funding plan during a general body meeting on Friday. Municipal Commissioner   was not present during the meeting. Instead, PMC’s chief accountant,  , attempted to mount a defence of the funding plan.
 
 The ambitious 24x7 water supply project aims to cover all of Pune and the distribution network is expected to cost Rs 1,800 crore. A total of Rs 300 crore will be spent on a reservoir and another Rs 700 crore for the installation of water meters.
 
 Last month, the PMC had raised Rs 200 crore by selling 10-year bonds on the stock market — becoming the first ever civic body in India to secure cash from such a route in 14 years. Proceeds from the issue, raised at a coupon of 7.59 per cent, was oversubscribed six times. For the comfort of investors who are part of the bond programme, which does not come with any guarantee from the state government, an escrow account has been created to deposit the funds.
 
 Mayor Mukta Tilak has asked the civic administration to present a detailed response to the opposition's questions before a GB soon. She said all elected members must understand the stock market concept and why it was important to raise money from such a source.
