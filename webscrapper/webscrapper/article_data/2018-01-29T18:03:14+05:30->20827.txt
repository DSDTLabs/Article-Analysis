Gurgaon: The health department has vaccinated 3,500 children in the entire district under the Intensified   (IMI) drive, thus achieving a target of 100 per cent. Under this drive, children are vaccinated against preventable diseases such as  ,  ,  ,   ect. During the four months campaign that was held between October 2017 to January 2018, the department had set a target of vaccinating 3,369 children in the city. For this, 427 sessions were organised, of which 101 sessions were held in high risk sites. Earlier, only 79.4 percent children were fully immunised, whereas 24 percent children were partially vaccinated and one percent never received a  . TNN

 “The drive aimed at increasing the   coverage by vaccinating all children up to two years of age. We conducted a vaccination camp for a fortnight every month between October 2017 to January 2018 and now we have crossed our target,” said M P Singh, district immunisation officer.
 
 The biggest challenge was to cover the labour and migrant population. Officials noticed that most of the labourers leave for work by 9am. As a result of this, their children were either left unimmunised or were partially immunised. The slums were termed as high-risk areas and the vaccination drives were organised there from 7am to 9am. This was crucial in order to increase the number of fully immunised children in the district.
 
 In Haryana, IMI drive was conducted in four districts including Faridabad, Palwal and Mewat, besides Gurgaon. Children were vaccinated against preventable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Polio, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Tetanus, Haemophilus Influenza B Pneumonia and Meningitis, Hepatitis B, Measles and Rotavirus Diarrhoea. The drive was monitored by the Prime Minister’s office. The report will be supervised by the cabinet secretary at the national level and would continue to be monitored at the highest level under PRAGATI.
