BHOPAL: Vacations are here and it is reflecting on the train reservation availability. The early birds who planned their travel in advance are lucky, but those making last minute plans or emergency travel are stranded. Be it to Gorkahpur, Goa or Trivandrum — all trains to these destinations are full at least till early June.
 
 Tickets in no class are available and in some cases even waitlisted tickets are also not available. Most of the long-distance superfast trains passing through Bhopal have waiting list of 120 to 200 till early June at least.
 
  
  
 To keep up with the vacation rush, railways had announced eight special trains, but Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committee ( ) is now demanding five more special trains.
 
 “Last two meetings of DRUCC could not take place. We wished to make a presentation about our demand for at least five more special trains. The proposal could not be forwarded to   as there was no meeting,” said Niranjan Wadhwani, a DRUCC member.
 
 Not all the summer special trains were decided in one go, said PRO, railways, Bhopal, I A  . “As the rush increases, we will increase the number of trains. It’s not that we shall have only eight summer specials. The number could go up or come down depending upon passenger traffic,” he said.
 
 Vaibhav Dubey, who wanted to visit his parents in  , returned empty-handed from Habibganj railway station as he tried for reservation in any of the trains that ply on the route and in any class for May. “Schools are still on. I thought, there could be a chance. But is appears I will look for alternate means or defer my visit,” he said.
