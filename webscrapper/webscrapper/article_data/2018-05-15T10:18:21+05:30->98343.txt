JAIPUR: High court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the validity of the centrally framed prevention of   Rules 2017.

 The division bench of justice MN   and DC   gave the order on a petition by   of Rajasthan. The petition challenged the various provisions claiming central government had no power to frame rules and dog sellers cannot be categorised as breeders.
 
 According to the rules dogs can be bred only once a year which was objected by the petitioners.
 
 Additional Solicitor General   representing the Union of India argued that prevention of cruelty was in the concurrent list of the Seventh Schedule of the constitution and the central government had the power to frame rules to prevent cruelty to dogs and animals. On the concurrent list both the state and Centre can legislate but in case of a dispute the central law will prevail.
 
 He said the traders of pubs wanted to have frequent birth of pubs which would have negative bearing on the health of the animals. He said the objection is based purely on commercial interests.
