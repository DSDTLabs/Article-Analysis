LUCKNOW: A man allegedly strangulated an 18-month-old baby to death and also attempted to kill his mother over a property issue in   on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. However, the  , which came late on Wednesday, revealed the baby seemd to have died of natural causes. 

 The victim, identified as Diwakar, was sleeping next to its mother Sunaini in their house in Pahadnagar   of Gosainganj. The infant's father was out of town. Around 10.45 pm on Tuesday, Sunaini's uncle Anil allegedly barged into the house. He reportedly tied Sunaini up with a dupatta and then choked Diwakar's mouth till he died.

 Sunaini came out and found her son dead. Her neighbours then called the police. 
 
 Sunaini lodged a complaint against Anil for killing her son and attempting to kill her while she named Anil's wife Santoshi, her uncle Sunil, her father's sister, cousins and 'tantrik' Tej Narayan for hatching the conspiracy.

"Now, we will approach the case differently, although we have registered an FIR on the basis of Sunaini's complaint," he said.
