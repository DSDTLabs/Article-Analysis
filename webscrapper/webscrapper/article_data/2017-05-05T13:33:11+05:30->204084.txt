CHANDRAPUR: Mystery continues over the cause of death of a tiger whose carcass was found in Saoli range on Wednesday evening. A team of veterinary doctors on Thursday failed to ascertain the cause of death of the feline during a post-mortem examination due to the decomposed nature of the body. Forest department officers, however, ruled out poaching, stressing that all valuable body parts like teeth, nails and skin were intact.

 ACF Rajan Talmale said that the carcass had decomposed due to high temperature. He suspected that carcass was five days old. “Even viscera samples could not be taken as internal organ such as heart, liver, lungs were completely decomposed,” he said. The vets succeeded in identifying the tiger as an adult male. Bone samples have been taken for its confirmation. Talmale maintained that even the search of the surrounding area did not give any clue about territorial fighting.
 
 Earlier in the morning, a team of veterinary doctors comprising wildlife veterinary officer, TATR, Dr Ravikant Khobragade, LDO Dr Sandeep Chounkar, Dr Dhok and Dr   carried out the post mortem on the dead body of tiger at the spot. NTCA representative   and PCCF representative   supervised the post-mortem formalities. 
 
 Ram Dhotre, RFO, Saoli range, MP Rathod along with ACF Talmale were present on the occasion.
 
 Remains of tiger were cremated at the same place after autopsy before the witnesses.
