BHOPAL: An IED hidden in an FM radio set exploded as soon as it was turned on, severely injuring a young doctor of Sagar and two others.

 This is said to be the first ‘parcel radio bomb blast’ in the state. A similar case was reported in Hyderabad in 2009 when a real estate agent was killed. The MP anti-terrorist squad and intelligence officials are conducting the probe along with police.
 
 
 The radio was couriered to the office of the doctor’s father,  , who is superintendent of Sagar post office, on January 23. Since he was on leave, a driver of the postal department dropped it at his home in Macronia area of Sagar.
 
 Around 9.45am on Thursday, Dr Ritesh  , 25, switched it on. It blew up, injuring Ritesh, his uncle   and their servant Dev Sen. Dixit escaped unhurt as he was on the third floor of the house, say police.
 
 “Ritesh has sustained critical injuries. His uncle and servant are also badly wounded,” said R S Thakur, in-charge of Padmakar police station, where an FIR has been registered for attempted murder and under Explosives Act.
 
 
 
 
 Police believe Dixit senior was the target since the parcel was delivered to his office. Four teams have been constituted to investigate the case and police have announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for information leading to arrest of the accused.
 
 “The parcel was dispatched through a local courier by ‘Abhisheikh Jain’. It seems to be a fake name. We are scanning CCTV footage to close in on the suspects,” said the police officer.
 
 Forensic experts are trying to ascertain the type of explosive used.
 
 This is the first murder bid by ‘parcel radio bomb’ in MP, said a police officer. Other parcel bomb murders reported across the country include that of a journalist in Howrah, a JD(U) Leader in Patna and a schoolteacher in Malda.
