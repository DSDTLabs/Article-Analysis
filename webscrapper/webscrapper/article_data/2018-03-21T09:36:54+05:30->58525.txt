VELLORE: Criticising political leaders in   for protesting against VHP-led  , state president of the BJP   has said the leaders of opposition parties, particularly DMK working president  , are trying to play the “communal hatred card” for political mileage.

 “Political party leaders like Stalin were playing divisive  . I ask them to stop it,” Tamilisai told reporters here on Monday. She was in Vellore to take part in party meetings at Ambur and Katpadi.
 
 Calling the state-wide protest against the yatra as an “attack on the belief of Hindu people," she said, “Ramar ratham (chariot) is coming for the people those who have belief. If you (opposition leaders/protestors) not want it, you can boycott it.”
 
 Criticising communist party leaders and cadres for joining the protest, she asked why the yatra was not opposed in a Left-ruled state (Kerala). She added that the yatra had passed through several states peacefully.
 
 “We will act strongly if such incidents continue and we will protest without affecting law and order and communal harmony,” she added.
 
 “The   is growing in the state. It is ready to face the local body election at any time,” she said, adding, “Our aim is to emerge as an alternative party in Tamil Nadu. In the present situation, no party other than BJP can be an alternative party to the existing parties (AIADMK/DMK). We have launched a programme to meet booth level functionaries in the state. It is to propagate that we are growing as a strong party in the state.” 
 
  Asked about a Cauvery water management board, she said the central government had been taking measures to form the board. “Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Arjun Ram Meghwal and Nirmala Seetharaman have openly said that the board will be constituted. A statement has been made in the Parliament. The government is taking efforts towards it,” she said.
