Mumbai:   MD   took a jibe at   and other digital wallets saying they have no future as they don’t have enough margins to sustain their businesses. “The wallet proposition as a valid economic proposal is doubtful. Paytm’s reported losses is Rs 1,651 crore and you can’t have a business that says ‘pay Rs 500 bill and take Rs 250 as cashback’,” he said at the   ( ) on Friday.

 Puri said the wallet companies cannot copy the   as the Indian regulators are “better”, hinting that regulators here will play tough.
 
 Drawing from his experience from a trip to the Silicon Valley to look at evolving scenarios in the financial services world, Puri said Apple Pay is also another version of the wallet and there is no “reimagining” of a bank that’s happening in the Valley. 
 
 Puri noted that banks also have wallets for e-commerce transactions and said the standalone wallet companies depend on the bank as an intermediary to get the funds. Additionally, the launch of the unified payments interface (UPI) makes it possible for banks to carry out transactions faster. “Is this wallet any better than mine, other than a cash back? I don’t have a Rs 1,651 crore loss. You eliminate the loss, then we will talk,” he told reporters on the sidelines of NILF.
 
 Asked about the higher deposit rates of over 7% that payments banks are offering – Paytm will be entering the space soon – Puri said such high returns are not sustainable. “When he (Paytm) launches the bank, then we will see. Judge the risk and put your money,” he said.
