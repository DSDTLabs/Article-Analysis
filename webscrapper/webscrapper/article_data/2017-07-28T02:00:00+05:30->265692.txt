PATNA: Agitated over not being invited to form government despite being the single largest party in Bihar assembly, RJD on Thursday threatened to disrupt the proceedings of the special session on Friday when CM   is scheduled to seek trust vote in the 243-member House.

 The party also demanded immediate resignation of CM Nitish and BJP’s  , saying both have taken oath despite the popular mandate against the BJP and RSS ideology in the 2015 assembly elections.
 
 “We will not allow the assembly to run smoothly till Nitish and Sushil resign and seek fresh mandate. We dare them to go for election,” RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha told reporters at the RJD headquarters here.
 
 He also said governor in-charge   violated the norms set by the Supreme Court in the S R Bommai case by not inviting the single largest party to form the government. He also said RJD would challenge in the Supreme Court the governor’s decision to invite JD(U) to form government in violation of its directive.
 
 “We will also go to the people and inform them about the conspiracy hatched by the BJP in connivance with Nitish,” Jha said. 
 
 The RJD spokesman said the way governor invited JD(U), a smaller party, to form government amounted to the murder of the spirit of the Supreme Court judgement in the Bommai case.
 
 Senior RJD functionary and former state minister   echoed Jha’s demand and said it was the governor’s duty to invite RJD to form government.
 
 Another senior RJD man and former finance minister   said Nitish, who is now the CM of NDA government, would have to face people’s protest across the state because he has betrayed their mandate given in 2015 against the BJP ideology.
