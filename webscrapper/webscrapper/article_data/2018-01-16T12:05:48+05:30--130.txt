AGRA: City has a vital link with Israel as two lakh households here get their drinking water supply from Sikandra water treatment plant which is based on Israeli technology.

 First of its kind in south Asia, the water treatment plant works on moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology.   had established the plant under its ongoing   in 2014 with an investment of around Rs 138 crore.
 
 Piyush Pankaj, general manager of Gangajal Project, said: “The plant has a capacity to supply 144 million liters a day. Sikandra’s MBBR has one of most advanced water treatment plants in south Asia.”
 
 According to   officials, MBBR technology involves thousands of polyethylene bio film carriers operating in mixed motion within an aerated wastewater treatment basin. Each individual bio carrier increases productivity through providing protected surface area to support the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria within its cells. It is this high-density population of bacteria that achieves high-rate biodegradation within the system, while also offering process reliability.
 
 On November 17, 2016, Israeli president Reuven Rivlin and his wife Nechema had visited Agra and he had inspected the Sikandra MBBR plant.
