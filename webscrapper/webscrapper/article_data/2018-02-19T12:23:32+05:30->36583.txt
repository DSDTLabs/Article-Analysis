PANAJI:   ( ) has once again highlighted the issue of hardships faced by travellers due to problems at the tourist taxi counter and traffic congestion outside   airport. 

 TTAG submitted a memorandum in this regard to the chairman of Airport Authority of Goa (AAI) Guruprasad Mohapatra during his visit to the state last week. 
 
 TTAG president Savio Messias said that due to persistent problems at the taxi counter, it was suggested that more coaches be introduced at the airport. "Travellers should be offered more options, as is the case at any other international airport," he said.
 
 Currently, Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd ( ) operates a single coach from the airport every afternoon. "But this is not sufficient. The AAI chairman was open to the idea of having more coaches. But he proposed that the private sector be involved for this initiative," said Messias.
 
 He said that a lot of chaos is witnessed outside Dabolim airport, with taxi operators clamouring for customers, and added that this can be avoided if a system is put in place.
 
 TTAG also brought to the notice of the AAI chairman immigration delays due to non-functioning of five-six e-visa desks.
 
 Passengers face delays, particularly during the morning hours on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays when two wide-bodied aircraft arrive back-to-back at any given time, TTAG pointed out.
