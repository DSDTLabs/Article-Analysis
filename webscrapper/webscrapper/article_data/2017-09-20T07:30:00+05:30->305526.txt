Mohali: The BMW car in which Seerat Kaur Dhillon was accused of allegedly transporting the body of her husband Aikom Singh Dhillon packed in a suitcase, has now partially submerged under wild growths. The car has been lying at Mataur police station, Mohali owing to its significance in the case.

 Sources in police department said they have not received summons from the court for the production of the car yet. The case hearing has been slated for September 20 as judge was on leave on the date of the previous hearing.
 
 Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “I am not aware whether summons have been received for the car. It has to be checked by SHO Mataur.” However, SHO, Mataur Jarnail Singh could not be contacted despite repeated phone calls.
 
 Sources in Mohali police said the tyres of the car will be inflated and then transported to court after being towed by a crane driven by a government employee. 
 
 The sources in police department said they have not touched the car and will now only remove the wild growth in order to make it ready for identification in court. During the previous hearing, police failed to produce the BMW car in court for identification. The suitcase in which Aikom’s body was packed was also to be produced in the court for identification.
