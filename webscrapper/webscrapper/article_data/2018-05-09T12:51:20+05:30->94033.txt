PATNA: The   (PMC) on Tuesday submitted a report to district magistrate Kumar Ravi, claiming 90% success in removing garbage from the transit point near   Hospital. The DM had asked the   last Saturday to remove entire garbage from the transit point at Gadanibagh by Monday. 

 
 
 “As per the DM’s directives, around 90% of the garbage has been removed from the Gardanibagh transit point. Bleaching powder was also sprinkled at the site to control the foul stench,” executive officer of PMC’s new capital circle Shailesh Kumar said.
 
 The DM said the PMC has been asked to ensure proper sanitation in the surrounding areas. He added until an alternate location is finalized for secondary garbage point or transit point, the one at Gardanibagh will serve as an intermediate junction for carrying the garbage to landfill site at Ramachak Bairiya. “Only smaller vehicles will be allowed to dump garbage at the Gardanibagh transit point. The bigger vehicles will dump garbage directly at the landfill site at Ramachak Bairiya located near   on Patna-Gaya road,” the DM added.
 
 The herculean task of cleaning more than 1,500 tonne of garbage from the dump site in 48 hours began on Sunday. The PMC engaged as many as 14 commercial tipper trucks for lifting garbage and transferring the trash to the landfill site.
 
 “In bigger cities, there are more than one transit point with advanced waste management techniques. However, in Patna, we have only one transit point which lacks proper technological support. It is nearly impossible to shift the transit location. However, presence of least garbage there can be ensured,” a PMC official said.
