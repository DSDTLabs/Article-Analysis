 Anshai Lal says actress-producer 
  isn't upset but baffled with reports of her alleged boyfriend   producing ' '. There were some media reports claiming that Anushka's alleged boyfriend Kohli had a big role to play in the film's production. 

 The ;Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' actress took to social media to shut down the rumors. Talking about the incident Anshai says, "I don't think she is upset. I think she is very baffled why these stories are coming out. 
 
  
  
 "She said what she had to say. We stand by her. It's quite ridiculous and irresponsible for these stories to come out. Leave it at that," he said. Ask him if Virat came on sets, Anshai said, "She said what she wanted to. I refrain from talking about it." 
 
 The 'NH10' actress had rubbished such stories as bogus. In a strongly-worded tweet, she had said, "By making such bogus claims and validating this rubbish by a so called 'source,' not only are you disrespecting me and the hard work I have put in over the years to be where I am, but also, all the people who have worked on this film." 
 
 
  Virat, 28, and Anushka, 28, have been reportedly dating since 2013 with a brief interruption in between. The upcoming romantic comedy film 'Phillauri' also starring Suraj Sharma,   releases on March 24.
