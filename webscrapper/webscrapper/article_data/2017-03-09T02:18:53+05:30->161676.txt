THANE: A 28-year-old   was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for stabbing his wife to death two years ago. 

 Rejecting the defence’s argument on the delay in registrating an FIR, the Thane district court pointed out that the priority of the deceased’s fam-ily was to save her life than lodge an FIR. Relying on the statements of 11 eyewitnesses, including the deceased’s mother, district sessions judge Mridula Bhatia convicted Omnarayan Sharma under IPC sections 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). 
 
 Prosecutor Bhuleshwar Hinge told the court that Omnarayan and Sheetal (27) had a love marriage in 2008 and they had two children. As Omnarayan used to fight with Sheetal over expenses and suspected her of having an extra-marital affair, she moved into her parents’ place in 2014. 
 
  On February 15, 2015, around 11.45pm, Omnarayan dropped in at her parents’ place and demanded that she return home with him or send their son with him. “He called her outside on the pretext of wanting to talk to her and abused and assaulted her. He stabbed her repeatedly with a knife and fled,” Hinge told the court. Sheetal’s mother and neighbours rushed her to Thane civil hospital and later to Sion hospital where she succumbed to the wounds. Sheetal’s parents filed an FIR the next day and Omnarayan was arrested.
