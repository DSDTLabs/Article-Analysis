VIJAYAWADA: In a first in the country,   has served notices on several   in the past few days for not providing vehicle insurance policy information to Hyderabad-based   (IIB). The department has also stopped allowing registration of vehicles in the state on the basis of insurance cover notes. 

 Officials swung into action after it was found that insurance data of only 25 lakh out of 90 lakh vehicles in the state was available with IIB, which is the central repository of vehicle insurance policies in the country. They then sent notices to risk firms, warning them of criminal action for not updating information.
 
 IIB is the only source for confirming the authenticity of vehicle insurance policies. One major reason for insurance firms not updating information is many people register their vehicles on the basis of insurance cover note but afterwards cancel the same and don't actually buy the policy.
 
 "This problem is mainly due to the fact that many people, after buying the cover note for insuring their vehicles, are cancelling the same within the 48-hour limit and getting their money back. Many of actually get the insurance policy don't bother to submit the same, which gets generated by the company after a few days," transport commissioner   told TOI. 
 
 According to officials, cover note is not a legal document, which gets generated at the agent level in  . The actual policy certificates are generated after agents send cover-note numbers to respective insurance companies. The policy number finally generated by the insurance company has to be updated with IIB. Subramanyam said following a state transport department request, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) warned risk firms of criminal action if they don't update information.
