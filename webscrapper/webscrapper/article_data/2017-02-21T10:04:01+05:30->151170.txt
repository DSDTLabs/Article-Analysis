BENGALURU: It was an emotional farewell for Ratnamma, 20, the eldest of jasmine seller D Thimmappa's three children.   was laid to rest under a tamarind tree where she played as a child, and had relished making dishes with its produce.
Speech-impaired since birth, Ratnamma breathed her last on Sunday as her family ferried her between home and doctors.
 
 After shifting her body on his moped and reaching home around 11am, Thimmappa donned white clothes and readied himself for the final rites.
 
 Ratnamma's younger brother Raju, who works as an   to support the family , walked up with some villagers to a tamarind grove, around 500 metres away, and selected a space measuring 6ft by 3ft to dig a grave.
 
 “We buried my sister here. It was here that she used to play as a young child,“ a sobbing Raju told TOI at the spot on Monday . By the time Raju and the others dug a 6-ft deep pit, family members and relatives who live in and around Veerapura, gathered at their home. A priest from  , another hamlet nearby, arrived to perform the final rites. By 3pm, Ratnamma was laid to rest.
 
 Varalakshmi, Raju's wife, said Ratnamma was as “innocent and fresh as a jasmine“.“She could hear, but not speak. She had a sharp memory. Before my marriage, I knew Ratnamma but I became close to her only later as she was of my age. I had to learn sign language to understand her. This took some time but we were the best of buddies. She would prepare excellent snacks with tamarind,“ she said.
 
 Thimmappa's youngest daughter is 12. He owns half an acre of dry land where nothing really sprouts. He collects jasmine grown from gardens in and around the village and sells them in the  . Once in a while, he goes to Tumakuru sell the produce.
