THANE: They may not be   but their Class X CBSE exam scores are almost identical. The 16-year-old   Shubhangi and   from Thane’s Lokpuram school used to get the same grades throughout their schooling. So, even in their CBSE exam the duo were determined to secure the same percentage.

 While Shubhangi, the elder of the two, scored 95.6%,   scored 94.6%. Although the girls preferred to study alone, they would solve worksheets and compete with one another. In case they would face face any problem they would also help each other.
 
 “Even if we are twins, we both had a different pace of studying. So we preferred self-study. We used to discuss worksheets, tests, homework together. We used to check on how each one has fared. I knew I could count on my sister in case of any problem,” said Sampriti, who was born just three minutes after Shubangi.
 
 When the two face exam pressure and stress, they would rely on each other to calm themselves down and keep their cool.
 
 “Whenever my sister would feel stressed, I would console and motivate her to do her best. Knowing that she is also sailing in the same boat, I would feel calmer and less anxious. Without her support and that of my teachers and parents, I wouldn’t have been able to do this well, ” said Shubhangi. 
 
 Meanwhile, while the twins have scored almost the same percentage in their boards, their career plan is completely different from each other. 
 
 While   intends to pursue medicine and is preparing for National Eligibility cum entrance test, Sampriti wishes to pursue engineering and has already secured admission for an integrated course.
