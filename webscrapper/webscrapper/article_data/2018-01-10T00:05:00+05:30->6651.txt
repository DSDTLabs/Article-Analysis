 has shot for three of his recent films on the   coast including the superhit 
 . “But let me tell you that I’m no stranger to this region. Karavali has been my go-to destination during summer holidays since my childhood. My 
  used to live in   and a cousin still lives in Mangaluru,” says the actor whose baritone has now become as popular as his acting skills. “I still remember going to all the neighbouring households back in those days for lunch and dinner and soaking in the hospitality that is unique to this region. That memory has stayed fresh till today. It is also the reason why I feel so at home when I am in this part of the world,” he says. While holidays have helped him explore places and experience the subtle beauty of this place,   his films in the Karavali have lent him a different perspective. “There’s the scenic coastline, mangroves, rivers, hills, forests, greenery, beaches, picturesque roads — name it and it’s here. This is why filmmakers love coming here — every kind of landscape beckons you. This isn’t the case in Bengaluru or its neighbouring cities,” he points out. Further, the shooting conditions are also conducive. “The weather is brilliant and consistent. While shooting this is one aspect that is extremely important for us and that is another reason people enjoy shooting here. Even the walls here provide an interesting backdrop,” says Vasishta. 

  Besides, there’s another factor that the actor has been mighty impressed by. “Through all this modernity and multiplex culture, the 
  and 
  pride (our land, our language) that is so deeply entrenched here is palpable in every nook and corner. This adds to the richness of our frames when we shoot on the coast,” he sums up.
