VADODARA: A day after a 13-year-old student of   got crushed under a state transport (ST) bus, the traffic police have asked all the three schools near   to close their front gates. 

 The front gates of these schools open right on the busy road thereby increasing the chances of road accident. The police have also asked for removal of the state transport bus stop near   Circle. 
 
 “We have asked authorities of Jai Ambe School, Ambe School and Bright School to close their front gates and open the rear gates. Students and parents should use the rear gate from now on. We had to take this decision as the road outside the front gate of these schools used to witness traffic chaos after school hours ended,” said Amita  , assistant commissioner of police (traffic). 
 
 “Also, many state transport buses stop at a bus depot near the Amitnagar Circle and occupy large part of the road. It also leads to chaos and traffic jams. So we have asked the   (GSRTC) to shift the bus stop to Urmi Crossroads or some other place,” Vanani told TOI. 
 
 The police is also in process of issuing a notification that will ban parking of vehicles on the road outside these three schools.
 
 “We had been conducting a survey of this area and had decided to make some changes. Alternate route is being suggested for ST buses and other heavy vehicles,” she added. 
 
 The cops have formed an auto-rickshaw squad, heavy vehicle squad and Amitnagar squad to crack down on vehicles flouting traffic rules. Nearly 183 autos, 24 vans and 14 heavy vehicles have already been detained.
