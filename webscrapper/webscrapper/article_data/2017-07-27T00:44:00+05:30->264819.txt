Puducherry: Lt governor   on Wednesday urged the Congress government to pass a resolution in the legislative assembly earmarking 50% of   seats in private medical colleges and hospitals under state quota.

 Speaking to reporters after paying tributes to the martyrs of the Kargil War at a memorial on the Beach Road, Bedi said the Tamil Nadu state had passed a resolution in the assembly securing 65% of MBBS and BDS seats in non-minority institutions and 50% seats in minority educational institutions under government quota.
 
 She insisted the government pass a resolution securing 50% of the seats in private institution for the benefit of the students from the Union territory. She regretted that the government did not take any initiative for passing such a resolution in the last assembly session. 
 
 “If the government passes a resolution in the assembly I will forward it to the Union government for immediate approval,” she said.
 
 Bedi is of the opinion that such a resolution will put an end to the stalemate in sharing of seats between the government and managements of private colleges every year.
 
 She instructed director general of police to lay a wreath daily at the Kargil memorial as a mark of respect and gratitude to the brave soldiers, who laid down their lives for the fellow Indians to live in peace and honour. 
 
 She also requested the   government to include Kargil Memorial in the scheduled list of sites visited by official dignitaries reaching Puducherry.
