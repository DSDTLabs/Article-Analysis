FATEHGARH SAHIB: The industries in the steel town of   on Thursday started receiving piped natural gas ( ) supply as fuel, giving hope that pollution levels in the town can be brought under control.

 Energy firm IRM Energy Private Limited started the PNG supply to Chanakya bakery unit at Mandi Gobindgarh. Mandi Gobindgarh is the second most polluted town in the state after the industrial hub of Ludhiana in terms of air pollution. There are more than 100 rolling industries, over 40 hammers and forging units, which run on coal or other fuel.
 
 The environmentalists say introduction of PNG would help reduce air pollution levels not only in the town but in the entire district. Officials of   (PPCB) would now also encourage other industries and automobile owners to use PNG for reducing air pollution.
 
 “We have initiated the supply of PNG to the industry in Mandi Gobindgarh. This is just a beginning. We are communicating with the Centre to boost the PNG suppliers so that it is cheaper for the industry to adopt cleaner fuel. Now black smoke will reduce and thus air quality will improve,” said PPCB chief environmental engineer  .
 
 “To save our coming generations from the ill effects of pollution, it has become the need of the hour to curb the menace of rising pollution levels. The pollution is rising due to burning of coal and other fuels in the industry, particularly at Mandi Gobindgarh, which is Asia’s biggest steel town. We initiated the PNG supply in this town so that pollution could be brought down,” said PPCB chairman Kahan Singh Pannu.
