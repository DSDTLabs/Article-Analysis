BENGALURU:   MP B K Hariprasad's resignation as   general secretary owning moral responsibility for the party's debacle in the Odisha panchayat polls has set the ball rolling for the party high command to kickstart a major overhaul of those in charge of states. 

  The task of putting in place new AICC general secretaries and secretaries will be taken up after Sonia and   return to India. This will also include a decision on state party president  's continuance, considering whether this will boost the Congress' prospects in the 2018 assembly polls. 
 
  The party's abysmal performance in UP was not as much a shocker as AICC general secretary  , in-charge of Goa, letting slip an opportunity to rule there. This is learnt to have raised questions on the need to have a good strategist as general secretary for Karnataka when it goes to the hustings.
