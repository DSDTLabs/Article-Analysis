VIJAYAWADA: Former   chief secretary and former executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( ), IYR Krishna Rao, on Monday shot off another letter to Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   urging him to order a probe into two main issues raised by Ramana Deekshitulu, the former chief priest of the temple. 

 In his two-page letter, Krishna Rao said, "With regard to the complaint that the rituals are not being properly conducted, there is a necessity to probe into the issue. And if proven true, the executives responsible for the lack of proper implementation of rituals should be punished. Since the complaint has come from the chief priest, it needs to be taken seriously." 
 
 Referring to the second complaint that land is being dug on a large scale in the 'Potu' region, the former TTD EO said that no one has the right to do such digging and the matter needs to be properly investigated. 
 
 "Deekshitulu is a whistleblower and should be protected by the government," he said, and expressed hope that the CM will revisit the issue. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Aikha Brahmana Vedika (United Brahmin Front) met in Vijayawada and passed resolutions supporting both Ramana Deekshitulu and IYR Krishna Rao. 
 
 The front demanded that the state government apologise to IYR and take back its decision of retiring TTD priests at the age of 65 years.
