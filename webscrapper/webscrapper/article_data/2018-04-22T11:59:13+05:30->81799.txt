LUDHIANA: A local court on Saturday asked the prosecution and defence to argue on the maintainability of the closure report filed by the   (VB) in the   on the next date of hearing. The court of session judge Gurbir Singh has fixed May 5 as the next date of hearing. The accused in the case include chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder Singh, among others.

 Captain’s counsel Trilok Sood said there were no arguments in the court from the prosecution or the defence side. He added that the court ordered that the prosecution and defence sides would argue on the maintainability of the closure report filed by the Vigilance Bureau in the case. “After the arguments, the court will order whether the closure report filed by the Vigilance Bureau is maintainable or not. Later, there will be arguments in the main case,” said Sood.
 
 In 2007, Vigilance Bureau had filed a case against 36 accused, including Captain Amarinder, his son Raninder, and son-in-law Raminder for allegedly favouring a Delhi-based firm for the City Centre project. Of the 36 accused, four — including the then   (LIT) chairman Paramjit Singh Sibia, and former minister Jagjit Singh — have already died.
 
 On August 19 last year, the Vigilance Bureau, contradicting its own initial enquiry report, had filed a closure report in the court. It had claimed that there was no scam at all, and no proof was found against the accused — including the chief minister, his son, son-in-law, and 33 other accused — after a re-investigation.
 
 Captain had announced the project in 2003, during his previous tenure as chief minister. Practically launched in 2006, the CM’s ‘dream project’ was to have shopping malls, multiplexes, and residential apartments.
