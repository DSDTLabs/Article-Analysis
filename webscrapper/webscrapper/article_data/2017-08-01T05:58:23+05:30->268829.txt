NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court rapped the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday for alleged irregularities in the allocation of funds to educational institutions, including to a Etawah-based college, when   was the chief minister in 2002-03.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice   questioned the state government over granting Rs 100 crore to educational bodies, allegedly without following procedures.
 
 “How could the money be allocated to a society without any guarantee of returns and scrutiny? ...The state government should clarify its stand,” the bench, also comprising Justice D Y Chandrachud, said.
 
 The top court asked UP’s   government to file a response on the issue within two weeks. The Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) of India had earlier detected irregularities in the allocation of funds to educational institutions in the state by the then government in 2002-03. 
 
 The auditor in a report had said an amount of Rs 35 crore was irregularly given to the   in Etawah. The court was told by CAG that proper procedures were not followed in releasing contingency funds to a college by the UP  , a subsidiary of the PWD department, and “gross irregularities” were found in the disbursal of funds. 
 
 The apex court had earlier asked the Centre to inform it if CAG had objected to the release of funds in connection with the birth centenary celebrations of former Prime Minister   to the college run by a society which had senior   (SP) leaders on its Board. 
 
 It had directed SP supremo Yadav to file his response and asked the Centre to apprise it about objections, if any, raised in the past by CAG. 
 
 The bench is hearing an appeal filed by one Mahendra Nath Rai against the dismissal of his plea in 2004 by the Allahabad high court, challenging the grant to the college for the centenary celebration in 2002-03.
