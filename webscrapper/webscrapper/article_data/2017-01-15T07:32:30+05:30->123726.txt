LUCKNOW: Is the departure of former minister and sitting MLA   from the   , preceded by former MP   and an MLA Shamsher Singh, a harbinger of bad times for the party?

 A few days ago, Aridaman Singh was one of the 220 MLAs who attended the meeting of SP legislators at the residence of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and also submitted an affidavit in his support.
 
 He soon defected to the ri val BJP camp and he has been assured a ticket by the BJP. Aridaman Singh had been a minister in the UP go vernment but was sacked from his post and reduced to being just an MLA.
 
 “I now feel that the Samaj wadi Party is a sinking ship and only BJP can help realize my dreams,“ he said, after joining BJP on Saturday in New Delhi.
 
 Before Aridaman, it was Ashok Pradhan who quit the Samajwadi Party to join BJP, followed by Shamsher Singh.
 
 Party insiders say many are waiting for the verdict from the Election Commission on the party symbol and may decide to take wings to safer political shores.
 
 “If the symbol is frozen by EC, going for an establis by EC, going for an established party like the BJP is a safe bet,“ said a Rajput MLA of the Samajwadi Party from the eastern UP. Party patriarch   had said recently that it is the BJP that is engineering a split in the party and that even some senior leaders were working according to its plan.
