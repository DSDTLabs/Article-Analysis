Buzz is that there is a cold war brewing hot between the two lead actors of Santoshi Maa,   Rajput and  . While Ratan plays  , the lead character, Debina was roped in a few months back to play a double role in the show. According to sources, Ratan and Debina both have good roles, but both feel that they have been sidelined to accommodate the other. Each one feels that the other has more dialogues and on-screen time.
Debina said, “There is no such insecurity brewing between us, at least not from my side. I am playing double roles in the show, so why would I feel jealous of Ratan getting a better role? Secondly, I don’t have to shoot with her so much. We share very less screen space, so how can there be a fight? Having said that, we are not friends and I don’t come on the set to make friends. I am interested in doing my work and focus on that. Ratan is someone I don’t wish to talk to or talk about, ever!” Ratan remained unavailable for comment.
