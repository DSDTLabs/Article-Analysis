SURAT: Powerloom weavers unanimously decided to keep their units shut for an indefinite period till the central government resolves their five-point demand with regard to Goods and Services Tax (GST). The decision was taken at a public meeting convened by   ( ) at   at Varachha here on Saturday. 

 Thousands of weavers from more than 35 industrial estates across the city and surrounding areas participated in the meeting. There are seven lakh powerloom machines employing over six lakh textile workers. The powerloom sector weaves around three crore meter of fabrics per day, valued at over Rs55 crore. Around 85 per cent of powerloom units are non-operational for the last 10 days and this has created a huge stockpile of grey fabrics.
 
 FOGWA president Ashok   said, “The burning issue concerning powerloom weavers is non-availability of input tax credit ( ), 5 per cent GST on weavers doing job-work and cheap import of Chinese fabrics. Leaders from our sector have been representing the issues to the ministers and bureaucrats for the past many days, but nothing has been done so far. Thus, we have decided to keep the units shut for an indefinite period. There are a few from the powerloom sector who are members of BJP. They are not in favour of keeping their units shut for an indefinite period.” The decision of indefinite strike was opposed by a few weavers’ association. They stated that weavers should go for three-day strike. 
 
 Jirawala said, “The entire weaver community is in favour of keeping the units shut for an indefinite period. We have called for a public meeting next week to decide on the future course of action. If need be, we will organize a mammoth rally.” 
 
 Sachin Weavers Association president Mahendra Ramoliya said, “We want simplification in GST, otherwise more than 60 per cent of small weavers will be wiped out from the industry. Those having more than 1,000 powerlooms are on safer side as they can integrate themselves, but what about the small ones?”
