MUMBAI: The Rs 3,000 crore expansion plan announced by   vice-chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh may not go down well with academicians. At an event on Thursday, Deshmukh announced the plan to set up a film academy on the Kalina campus. “We have already managed to raise over Rs 500 crore and we are reaching out to our alumni to raise more funds,” Deshmukh had said. 

 Many said that such major plans should be discussed and passed in academic bodies. Many said they re not even aware of the revenue-sharing model between the varsity’s Garware Institute of Career Education and Development and the Ramesh Sippy Academy of Cinema and Entertainment (RSACE).
 
 An academician said the university had previously allowed another entity to set up infrastructure and run courses on the campus, but the tennis academy so set up was under dispute. 
 
 “The other two institutes, Alkesh Dinesh Mody Institute and Garware, are set up by the university using donations and are run by it. We will have to study government norms before allowing an outside entity. The fees for running these courses may be on the higher side as RSACE is expected to provide their expertise,” the academician said. 
 
 A past Deshmukh plan was to buy an aircraft, but the management council turned it down.
