PATNA:   chief minister   sought to throw the ball in the Centre’s court while answering demands for an investigation into land deals by   chief Lalu Prasad’s family members, saying the state had no locus standi in it.

 Nitish said matters related to the Companies Act came under the purview of the central government. “RJD and Lalu Prasad have replied to the allegations made by   and the  . Is there any need of my reaction over those allegations?” Nitish said.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Nitish said one side (BJP) was making allegations against the second party, who are also making counter-allegations. “If the BJP thinks there is really some merit in its allegations, it should approach the law. What sort of inquiry we (state government) can do when the allegations are not under the state’s purview?” Nitish said. 
 
 Deputy CM and Lalu’s younger son  , who has also been accused of acquiring land via quid pro quo, was sitting beside Nitish. 
 
 Without naming either BJP or Sushil Modi, Nitish also said such an environment was being created in the state that all good work of the grand alliance government seemed “insignificant”. He said some people were unnecessarily targeting his government.
 
 The CM also advised reporters to get BJP’s allegations and RJD’s counter-allegations probed at their level. “Allegations are being levelled at wholesale rate. You people can also investigate.”
