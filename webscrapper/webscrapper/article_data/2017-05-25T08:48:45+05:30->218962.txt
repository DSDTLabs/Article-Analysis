PUNE: The district administration has started a   to check whether any   have come up in the hilly area of   where a   had led to the death of a woman and her 14-month-old daughter in 2013. Additional collector   said a team surveying the area would check for any illegal constructions and take necessary action wherever necessary. 

 It was on June 6, 2013, that a 30-year-old woman and her daughter were swept away in a flash flood in Shindewadi after rainwater came gushing down the hillside due to rampant illegal constructions on the Katraj hill slopes.
 
 Following the incident, the administration drew flak from all quarters and action was initiated against 200 structures on a stretch of about 6km, from new Katraj tunnel to Khed Shivapur, along the   highway . The administration and the National Highway Authority of India also razed illegal structures obstructing the natural flow of water near the tunnel to prevent such incidents in future.
 
 Kale said the administration during its action earlier in 2015 and 2016 had issued notices to nearly 80 landowners and fine to the tune of Rs 30 crore was recovered for illegal excavations being carried out in the hills across the Haveli taluka. Though there are no fresh reports of any new construction in the region.
 
 The district administration had issued penalty notices for illegal excavations under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and it will be done again if there are reports of any such cases.
 
 Kale said Bhor and Haveli tehsildars have been instructed to carry out surveys on the stretch to avoid similar incidents. Administration officials said reports were being sought on illegal encroachments on the hills and also the action taken.
