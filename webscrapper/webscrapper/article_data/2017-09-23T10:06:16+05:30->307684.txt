CHENNAI: Taking a leaf out of the Chennai airport,   (CMDA) is planning to have an integrated bus terminus on GST Road at   where commuters can board state-owned transport buses and omni buses under one roof. Passengers will have an airport-like experience at the terminus where the entry of visitors will be restricted as well.
CMDA sources said the idea was to create an integrated facility like the airport. "A flier can take either Air India or private carriers from an airport. Similarly , the bus terminus should be a public facility for people to board buses of their choice," a CMDA official told TOI.
 
 Koyambedu has two sepa rate terminals for transport corporation buses and fleets operated by private owners.While government buses ply from Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT), private fleets originate from Chennai Contract Carriage Bus Terminus (CCCBT). The plan to have an integrated terminus eliminates separate facility for private operators at Kilambakkam.
 
 Sources said the terminus will have access control. "Ent ry of visitors will be confined to a specific area where they can see off passengers," the official said. Thereafter, commuters will proceed to the bus bays.Luggage too will be screened.
 
 In a bid to decongest Koyambedu, the government announced satellite bus terminals at   and Kilambakkam. While north-bound buses will originate from Madhavaram, fleets to the southern districts will be shifted to Kilambakkam. Though 88 acres have been earmarked for the terminus at Kilambakkam, the design has been confined to 30 acres due to the presence of an Archaeological Survey of India-notified site in the neighbourhood. About 2,200 state-owned transport corporation buses and 500 omni buses are expected to be operated from the facility. On an average 70,000 commuters board south-bound buses at CMBT and approximately 6,000 commuters take buses from CCCBT for the southern districts.
