NEW DELHI: A   11-year-old girl was   by police —   after she went   — from central Delhi’s  , where she was found roaming. 

 The girl went missing late on Tuesday night from her residence in west Delhi’s Bindapur and a missing complaint was filed by her family members at the area police station. Her parents said this was the second time their daughter, who is mentally challenged, went missing. 
 
 Police scanned the CCTV footage of the area which showed the girl leaving her home at 11.48pm. She allegedly boarded DTC buses — one after another — and reached central Delhi by Wednesday morning. There, an officer on patrol duty spotted her. For the next one hour, cops roamed the area to locate her house. She could not recall her address. Cops clicked her photo and circulated it on all their WhatsApp groups. Following this, they received information about a missing complaint, which matched the girl’s description. 
 
 Meanwhile, in another incident, police arrested a 20-year-old man for kidnapping a 14-year-old girl from central Delhi’s   and rescued the girl. On Monday, a case of kidnapping was registered. “CCTV footage was scanned and this led officers suspect Ajay, who worked nearby, and was also found missing since the incident. A team was dispatched to his native place in Jaipur and he was found there,” said Mandeep Radhawa, DCP (central).
