AHMEDABAD: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief   said   must be respected in our country.   inaugurated a website in the memory of an   ideologue and freedom fighter  .

 Lauding contributions of Sardarsinh Rana, Bhagwat said, “Very few of us know about his role in creation of many renowned institutions like Banaras Hindu University and Shanti Niketan. He helped in the freedom struggle and worked not only for political liberty but also for social and religious reforms. This website is a great tribute to him and other unsung heroes.’’
 
 Rana had participated in India's freedom movement from London along with other leaders like Pandit Shyamji Krishna Verma, Madam Bhikaji Cama, Veer Savarkar, Lala Lajpat Rai and Lala Hardayal.
 
 Stressing the need to respect different voices, Bhagwat said: “Bhagini Nivedita once said that she liked everything about the Indian society but one thing she liked about Europe was the culture of respecting different voices. Today, we don’t want to respect ideological differences even if it is harming our country,” he said. Bhagini Nivedita was a Scots-Irish social worker, author, teacher and a disciple of Swami Vivekananda. 
 
 Bhagwat said, “In his constitutional assembly speech, Dr Ambedkar Saheb had said that the British government was a foreign government. Now we are independent. To express our grief before the British, we resorted to various means. Whatever we did was right at that point of time. Now, we cannot permit use of violence against our own people.”
 
 Governor O P Kohli and deputy CM   were also present on the occasion. The event was organized by Sardarsinh Rana’s grandson and former state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana.
