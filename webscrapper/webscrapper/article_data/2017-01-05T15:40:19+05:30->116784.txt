KOCHI: Despite setting up a   for the development and promotion of adventure tourism, the Centre has not yet laid out proper guidelines causing illegal and unauthorized adventure tourism activities to flourish in the state. 

 "Private agencies are the ones which carry out   activities for tourists here. The adventure tourism department just plans the groundwork coordination for the agencies," said  , chief executive of   (KATPS).
 
 The task force on adventure tourism was formed to resolve the issues related to the segment, which includes safety and security of adventure tourists.
 
 "As adventure tourism trips are gaining momentum, adventure sport guides and operators are mushrooming mostly in hill stations. Most of them have no license or safety gears to conduct such activities and thus can be disadvantageous to the tourists as well as to the development of the sector," said Harshik Gopal, an adventure sport guide.
 
 According to the Adventure Travel Operators Association of India (ATOAI) the formation of the National Task Force on Adventure Tourism will address such issues besides highlighting the natural endowments of the states to the global tourism market.
 
 "Rules and regulations as per the central government's guiding principles are yet to be laid out here. An enormous range of adventure sports such as paragliding, river rafting, trekking, camping, kayaking et al, which are at its very nascent stage in the state can be made more popular if proper guidelines are formed. These activities are now conducted only as part of annual festivals and have the potential to be modified to all-year-round tourism sports," said a KATPS official.
