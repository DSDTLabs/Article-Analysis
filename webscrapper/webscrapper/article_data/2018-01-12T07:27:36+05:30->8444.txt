HYDERABAD: In the wake of the death caused by a knife-wielding dancer at a marriage procession, the   police have launched 'Anti-Baraat Nuisance Gang' to curb the menace of dancing with swords, knives and revolvers during weddings in the Old City limits. 

 According to the South Zone deputy commissioner of police, V  , four teams in four divisions of the Old City will start working from Thursday. Each team will consist of one sub-inspector and 10 constables and will be available at night, said the deputy commissioner of police.
 
 "The team has been formed and several cordon and search operations were conducted to reduce stabbing cases in Old City.
