Surat: A sale invoice issued by a textile firm in the city has gone viral on social media. It has BJP’s lotus symbol and a punchline: ‘Kamal ka phool hamari bhool’. The bill is doing rounds in the textile markets in the city and other parts of the state. The portion of the bill that mentions the shop address and the name of the proprietor has been cropped. 

 Textile traders are unhappy with the Centre and the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Council for failing to address their genuine demands regarding GST.
 
 “The entire traders’ community in the market is unhappy with the government. The business has been badly affected ever since GST was implemented. The bill is just an example of a trader who is cursing himself for giving his vote to the BJP,” said leader of the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association Devkishan Manghani. tnn
