 '. The film, which will see him playing an antagonist for the first time, also stars  ,  ,  , Deepak and Anish. 

 Prabhudheva says, “The emotions in our films work largely because of dialogues. However, when no words are said, when silence lingers, the impact is even more. As an actor, I unlearned everything and approached this project like a child. And I think that it has worked. I’m now eager to know what the audience thinks of it.” 
 
 'Mercury', touted to be the first silent movie in the last three decades, is also the second silent film in mainstream Indian cinema since the era of talkies began. Writer-director Karthik says, “The idea of making a silent film has excited me ever since I did a silent short a few years ago. Everything you know about filmmaking changes when you work on a silent movie. The endless possibilities of experimenting with the genre and crafting a mainstream film out of it was a challenge, but that is what made me do it.” 
 
 'Mercury', presented by Pen Studios and Stone Bench Films and produced by Kaarthekeyen Santhanam and   (PEN), releases on April 13.
