A   means a child is born with an abnormally structured heart and/or large vessels. Such hearts may have incomplete or missing parts, may be put together the wrong way, may have holes between chamber partitions or may have narrow or leaky valves or narrow vessels. Congenital   covers a wide spectrum from small defects, which may be totally asymptomatic and compatible with a normal lifespan, to more severe forms which require urgent intervention.

 Most forms of   have no known cause. Uncontrolled  , alcohol or  , or exposure to industrial chemicals during pregnancy also can increase the risk of congenital heart malformations.
 
 In babies and toddlers, congenital heart disease can have a range of symptoms because every child and condition is different. More common symptoms include extreme tiredness, poor feeding, excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, breathing problems, chest pain and a blue tinge to the skin. If you notice any of these symptoms in your child, you should seek medical attention.
 
 Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some children won't require any treatment while others may need medication or heart surgery. There are also other new techniques and procedures that, in some cases, can be done instead of surgery.
 
 Parenting kids with heart defects includes learning about basics like feeding, giving medicines, and watching for signs of trouble, but it also involves encouraging kids to become involved in their own care.
 
 Because most congenital heart defects are now treated during infancy, it's often necessary to explain to an older child what happened in the past. When your child is old enough to understand, explain why he or she has a surgical scar, needs to take medication, or has to visit the paediatric cardiologist. Although it's tempting for parents to be overly protective, sheltering kids can make them feel isolated and stigmatized which might do more harm than a heart defect in the long run.
