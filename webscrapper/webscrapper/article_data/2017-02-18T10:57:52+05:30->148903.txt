PUNE: City-based   of   will collaborate with its US counterparts to develop 'green compounds', replacing  , for explosives.

 Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) authorities said, “We recently entered into an understanding to develop environment friendly initiatory compositions together, to meet the ever increasing challenges of safety and handling of hazardous operations involved in production of ammunition. Scientists of both laboratories will be working independently on synthesis and characterisation of various green primary compounds and share the information and technology for mutual benefit under the agreement. We are supposed to complete the project by mid 2019.“
 
 Under this project, scientists from both the countries will work to develop components which will not be dangerous to handle.
 
 Handling incendiary devices has always been a tough task for soldiers, especially when they are on missions.Components like lead azide and syphnate are highly sensitive and toxic.
 
 They can contaminate the environment and affect the health of soldiers and manufacturers in the ammunition factories.
 
 A senior DRDO official told TOI, “These primary explosives are used to start chain reaction in items like mortar rounds, rockets, small caliber munition and rockets, triggering more energetic secondary explosives or propellant charges.Our soldiers handle these items on a daily basis and are exposed to high risk to their lives.“
 
 Explaining the risk involved in handling the primary explosives, the official further said, “They can be set off by simple triggers such as dropping a half-ounce steel ball from a height of a few inches or from a static discharge. Once they get into human body , they work like poison.“
