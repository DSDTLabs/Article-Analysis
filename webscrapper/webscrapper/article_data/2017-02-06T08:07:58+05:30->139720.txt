MUMBAI: The Central Information Commission ( ) has brought the private Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board under the purview of the RTI Act. The ruling came after the appellant’s request for copies of his son’s   answer sheets for six subjects was turned down. Kaushik’s father had applied for rechecking of his son’s papers, but CISCE norms only allow the verification of marks at a fee of Rs 4,000 for all papers.

 Under the new rules, students will be able to get copies of answer books and also apply for re-evaluation. “An examining body like CISCE might have an intellectual property right over the question paper, but they do not have any such right over answer sheets of students,” the CIC said in its order. “Without sharing evaluated answer sheets, the board cannot assure justice to students who, at times, might be victims of unreasonable evaluation. It is not proper on the part of this prestigious council to leave students remedy-less in such situations of injustice,” the order said.
 
 This order follows two high court judgments holding that CISCE was not a public authority. “The issue is not whether it is a public authority but whether it should be accountable or not,” the CIC order stated. The   had earlier directed the CBSE to share answer sheets with students who seek re-evaluation.
