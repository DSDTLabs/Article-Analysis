 Surat: Many spend years to clear Chartered Accountancy exam while this 19-year-old girl has cleared it in one go and became the youngest female to become a CA in country. She is entering into the field at a very young age which is largely dominated by men but don’t find it challenging at all.
 
 “I don’t think men have dominance in field of accountancy or business. It is just because women don’t try hard. I did not find it that much difficult to clear the exam since I was determined and prepared well,” said Ritu Nolakh, daughter of a retail auto parts trader. She hails from a town Lunkaransar near Bikaner of Rajasthan and came to the diamond city in 2012 to prepare for CA after completing school. 
 
 Ritu cleared the CA exam in both groups with 418 marks out of 800 in results announced in February 2017. She also cleared two groups of Company Secretary (CS) of total six subject along with CA and now preparing to clear the third group.
