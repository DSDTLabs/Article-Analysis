HYDERABAD: Maulana Sayyed Salman Hussaini Nadvi, executive member of  , on Friday stoked controversy by saying the government should allot land to Muslims away from the disputed Babri site to build a mosque and a sprawling university and that Hindu leaders should not stake claim to any other Muslim place of worship.

 Nadvi made this statement a day after the Supreme Court, hearing a bunch of petitions, said it would hear the case as “a pure land dispute”.
 
 Before executive members of the Board formally met for the plenary, AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, without referring to Nadwi’s statement, said Muslims believe that once a mosque it’s always a mosque. “I expect the Board to decide on these lines,” he said.
 
  
 
 Maulana Nadvi, who teaches at the Islamic seminary Nadwatul Ulema or Nadwa Madrassa has drawn flak from other senior members of the Board who met at Hyderabad.
 
 A source close to Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani said he was vehemently opposed to Nadvi’s suggestion which he likened to sabotaging Muslim claims over Babri Masjid site. He is learnt to have demanded action against Nadvi at the Hyderabad meeting of the Board. Both Madani and Nadvi are attending the Board meeting.
 
 A special invitee to the Board meeting who came from Lucknow said: “Salman Nadvi should not have made this comment when the Board has already said we would abide by the court order.”
 
 Zafar Sareshwala, chancellor, Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MAANU) who is close to Maulana Nadvi, however, came out in his support. “You cannot doubt his credibility and credentials as an Islamic scholar. His statement has been blown out of context. What he said makes sense,” Sareshwala said.
