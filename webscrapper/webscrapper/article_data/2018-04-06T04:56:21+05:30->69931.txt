BENGALURU: The war of words between   and   in Karnataka on social media is turning out to be more and more acerbic by the day.

 On Thursday, Congress called BJP national president   its "star campaigner" after he doled out a few words of praise about Karnataka being a major producer of silk in the country. Shah made the statement on March 31.
 
 From its official handle,   tweeted: "Thank you, Amit Shah, for speaking the truth yet again. You are turning out to be our Star Campaigner! Karnataka's Silk production hit an all-time high in 2016-17. Major cocoon markets have been modernised & integrated with the e-Mandi platform." In another tweet, Congress said: "Four cold storages exclusively for sericulture farmers have been established at Tumkuru, Channapatna, Hassan & Mandya. In the last five years, cocoon yield has increased by 14 kg/acre. Our initiatives have benefited 1.38 lakh farmers and reelers." Shah had assured silk reelers of Karnataka that BJP would set up a state-ofthe-art silk hub in the state if the party comes to power.
