AURANGABAD: A   at railway crossing gate 92 near  , a few minutes before passing of Manmad-Dharmabad-Marathwada Express on late Tuesday evening, sparked rumours.

 While locals and railway activists were of the view that major tragedy was averted as a mishap involving a tanker took place just before the train arrived at the railway crossing gate, railway authorities have ruled out any such speculations. 
 
 Detailing about the incident, A K  , divisional railway manager for   division, said, “A tanker had hit the railway crossing gate from one side when it was descending.”
 
 “The driver of the tanker was apparently in inebriated condition and ran away from the spot. His reckless driving not only caused damage to one of the railings, but also injured a girl waiting at the crossing,” he said.
 
 Sinha said, “The railway crossing in question was installed with inter-locking gates, which he said served as a fool-proof safety measure.”
 
 The key feature of the inter-locking gates is that they do not allow railway signals to become green unless the railing on either side of the crossing gate are tightly fit. As soon as the accident took place, railway signal turned red. Accordingly, a caution signal was sent to the station master who slowed down the speed of three trains, including  , he said.
 
 The freak mishap eventually resulted in detention of Marathwada Express and two other trains for nearly two minutes. 
 
 The South Central Railway has launched a complaint against concerned tanker driver with the Government Railway Police, which has initiated a manhunt based on the registration number of vehicle.
