CHANDIGARH: A service extension granted to Chandigarh Police deputy director (administration)   was cancelled on Friday, after retired sub-inspector   staged a protest against him outside the UT Secretariat, Sector 9, here.

 Kumar claimed that   had conspired to hold his promotion to the rank of a sub-inspector and that he got the rank of even a sub-inspector just a few days before his retirement. He claimed that Dogra did not give any reasons for holding his and several other cops’ promotions.
 
 The retired sub-inspector wore black-coloured clothes as a mark of protest, with messages pasted on his clothes, claiming that Dogra’s hands were soaked in the blood of police personnel. “There is just not one, but several examples where he held back promotions of police personnel for no reason. He too doesn’t have the right to get an extension for even a single day,” said Kumar.
 
 After the protest, the UT home department issued a letter to revoke the orders of service extension granted to Dogra on the last day of his service. In a letter written to UT director general of police, the department said no extension should be granted to the officer. Dogra could not be contacted for comment.
