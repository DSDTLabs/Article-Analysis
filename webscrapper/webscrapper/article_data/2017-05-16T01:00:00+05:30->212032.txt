Writer-lyricist Manoj Muntashir is thrilled with the response his work has been garnering from audiences across age groups. While his song ' ' ('EK Villain') topped the charts in 2014, ' ' ('Rustom') and ' ' ('MS Dhoni — The Untold Story') were counted among the most popular tracks last year. 

 This year too, all three versions of his emotional number 'Main Phir Bhi Tum Ko Chaahunga' (' ') has struck a chord with listeners. He says, “I am destiny’s child, the chosen one to bring poetry back into the world of cinema.”
 
 Manoj’s dialogues for the Hindi version of 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion' have also been appreciated. He is quick to point out that the right word is ‘trans-creation’ and not ‘translation’ because he also ensured that his lines were in sync with the lip movements of the actors. “Audiences from the South actually told me that they liked the Hindi version more,” he says.
 
 The lyricist, who is a regular feature on a popular music show, co-hosted its Mother’s Day Special consecutively for the second year. When asked if he is ready to judge reality television shows as well, he replies, “Kyun sochna hai jaana kahaan, Jaaye wahin le jaaye jahaan… Besabriyan… Need I say more?”
 
 Interestingly, he is one of the few modern lyricists to have fan clubs on social media. Manoj, who has been conferred with the highest state honour of Uttar Pradesh, credits his fans for his success. “Main jo jee raha hoon, wajah tum ho. Their innocent love keeps me going. I am also thankful to Bhushan Kumar for believing in me,” says the lyricist, who has penned more than 150 songs so far.
