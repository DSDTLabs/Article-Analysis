Panaji: The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) slammed chief minister Manohar Parrikar saying that he had failed to crackdown on the growing drug trade and the threats faced by the common man from the drug mafia. Pointing out that even water resources minister Vinod Palyekar had been vocal about threats to his life, GPCC president Shantaram Naik said Parrikar should hand over the home ministry to another minister who could take on the drug mafia.

 “The fear expressed by Vinod Palyekar that is life is in danger shows the threat from the drug mafia. If the minister is afraid, think about the common man,” Naik said. “This is a failure on the part of the home minister Manohar Parrikar. He is not capable. And if he says that there is no threat to Vinod Palyekar’s life, then he is lying.” Among other issues, the Congress president called for reduction in state taxes on petrol and diesel so that fuel prices could be eased. “The state government should curtail taxes on petrol to give relief.” tnn
