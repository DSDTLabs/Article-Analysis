KOLKATA:  , who moved into   on the 11th floor of   apartment almost a year ago, was a recluse. Other residents of the housing complex, on learning about De's death, claimed they hardly had any interaction with him.

 The neighbours pointed out that initially when De moved into the apartment, they were apprehensive about him living there. “We were scared when he started living in the flat here. But we soon discovered that he kept to himself. He did not interact with anyone and we barely knew anything about him,“ said Md Kasim, who lives on the fourth floor. Other neighbours said some church officials and De's landlord were the only visitors to his flat. “He was always very quiet and never interacted with us. We mostly saw him entering and leaving his flat. We never saw him talk to anyone,“ said  , who lives in a flat opposite to De's home.
 
 Even the resident of Flat 11F, Sakil Anwar, seemed unanimous with the others, saying De was a reserved individual. “His caregiver used to come to the flat every day ,“ Anwar said.
 
 De would apparently go for a morning walk within the apartment complex every day but had stopped around a week ago. “He joined some of us on the walks but never spoke to us. He did not come for a week,“ said  , another neighbour.
 
 Rehana Parveen, another occupant living on the fourth floor, said around six months ago, she mustered the coura ge and spoke to De. “I asked him if his flat was rented. He only repli ted. He only replied with a `yes',“ she said.
 
 The apartment's security guard said De was often seen carrying food packets. He would get into his car with a bag and leave and then, return by late afternoon, he added.
 
 A cleaning staff, who collected trash De's door, said, “The last time I saw him was on Monday morning, when he opened the door as I went to take the garbage. I wished him `good morning' and he greeted me back,“ said Md Samim, the cleaner.
