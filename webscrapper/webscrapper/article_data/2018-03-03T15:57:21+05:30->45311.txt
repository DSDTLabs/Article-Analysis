She has got the tag of a drama queen; this is one epithet that   loves to flaunt! Her social media timelines are filled with videos and pictures that narrate the story of this girl, who has rightfully earned her place under the sun.

 
 
 
 
 This girl sure has a knack for being in news. And if it is not for her projects, Rakhi ensures that she grabs the limelight by the collar. Her latest pictures in some of the outlandish attires on Holi and the bindas post bhang dance, bring a smile to your face.
 
 
 
 
 Recently she also indulged in a solo   while lying on her sofa. The singing is quite out of sync but the total effect is again quite hilarious. Here are the pictures that prove this point beyond doubt!
