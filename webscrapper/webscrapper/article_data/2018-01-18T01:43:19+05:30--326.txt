NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council on Wednesday assured   it won’t take any action against sub-licensees occupying commercial space at   Hotel, till pendency of the petition.

 An oral undertaking before Justice Rekha Palli by the civic agency came while hearing a challenge to the latest order issued by   on sealing of the commercial block of the hotel.
 
 HC sought to know from the agency if it gave an opportunity to the tenants to respond to the grounds of  . 
 
 Appearing for the council, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain defended NDMC’s order asking the tenants to vacate the premises in seven days and maintained that the sub-licensees have no “privity of contract” with the local body as they have neither paid licence fee nor any tax and are liable to be evicted.
 
 Jain alleged the hotel owners have sold off parts of the commercial tower without its approval or knowledge, even though it is government property.
 
 Last week, NDMC had issued an administrative order dubbing the occupants as “complete strangers to NDMC” and on that ground not being subjected to eviction under Public Premises Act. It had asked them to vacate the premises in seven days as part of its efforts to penalise the Hotel for non-payment of licence fee.
 
 The tenants approached court through advocate Diljit Singh Ahluwalia, challenging the January 10 order on several grounds. Ahluwalia, a tenant himself, argued the latest NDMC order, violates the earlier high court order where it stayed sealing of the premises.
