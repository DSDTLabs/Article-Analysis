SHIMLA: The first week of October is going to be epic for  . The reason is quite simple: Both the giant parties ­the BJP and the Congress ­ would be holding their rallies back to back in the coming week.While Prime Minister   is expected to inaugurate AIIMS and address a BJP rally on October 3, AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi is all set to take the stage on October 7.

 The state in the last few weeks has already gathered a lot of gifts from the two parties. It was observed that chief minister   was on an inauguration spree where he had laid foundation stones of several projects worth crores of rupees.
 
 To counter this, the BJP wants to ensure the foundation stones laying of mega projects like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bilaspur, Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) at Saloh in Una district and Steel Plant at   in Kangra district.
 
 Sources said that with its Bilaspur rally, the BJP is eyeing to return to power with thumping majority on the back of   wave.
 
 While Congress is going to the polls with the slogan of 'mission repeat', BJP is eyeing to oust Congress by giving the slogan of 'mission 50 plus'.
 
 A senior BJP leader and leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal said the BJP leaders and workers will be seen with a massive gathering and this would mark the end of the Congress regime in the state.
 
 He said that after becoming Prime Minister, Modi revived special state status of Himachal Pradesh. He also said that un der the 14th finance commission, financial assistance of state has been increased by 234 per cent to Rs 40,625 crore.
 
 “Modi government has allocated 66 national highways, three four-lanes and six overhead bridges to the state,“ Dhumal said.
 
 Dhumal further said that setting of AIIMS would be a milestone in providing best healthcare facilities to the people of the state, while IIIT would help Himachal to emerge as an education hub.
