With   continuing to remain tense on Wednesday, the state government suspended internet services in the neighbouring districts of Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari for five days from Wednesday evening. The government has directed internet service providers to stall data connectivity till May 27.

 The state government took the step following advice from the Centre when union home secretary   spoke to Tamil Nadu chief secretary   to ascertain the ground situation in Tuticorin.
 
 “During the interaction, the union home secretary suggested that the state suspend internet services in the troubled region to prevent spread of rumours and false alerts through social media until the situation is brought under control and the state agreed to do so,” a source in the Tamil Nadu government told TOI.
 
 Additional chief secretary to Tamil Nadu government  , in charge of the home department, in a communication to nodal officers of all internet service providers recalled the death of “some people in police action” during protests against Sterlite factory at Tuticorin on May 22 when around 20,000 people, mobilised mainly through social media, had engaged in violence.
 
 “Provocative messages are being spread on social media and antisocial elements are trying to exploit the situation,” he said.
 
 “A public emergency has arisen which necessitates immediate action and speedy remedy for public peace and it was felt necessary that internet services be stopped to prevent spreading of such rumours,” the government communiqué said.
 
 “The internet services for mobile devices have been cut for now,” an employee with a private telecom company said.
