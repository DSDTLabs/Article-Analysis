 JAIPUR: With final exams round the corner, teachers are on toes to identify stress-related cases. Counsellors and senior teachers of most schools are receiving calls from students sharing exam-related queries. This year, the call inflow has increased due to scrapping of Class X classroom exam. 
 
 Lata Rawat, principal, Cambridge Court High School, says that with growing awareness, calls on school helpline numbers have increased manifold.
 
 “Our trained teachers ensure that they read students’ mindset while he/she is explaining their query. On finding any symptom indicating the child is under intense stress, we immediately take corrective measures like extending counselling or informing parents,” said Rawat.
 
  has also started a toll-free helpline service from February 1 which will continue till April 29. The centralized toll-free number is functional from 8am to 10pm. Most of the queries are simple or subject related. At times, the queries leave the counsellors scratching their heads. Can I carry my lucky charm teddy inside the examination hall? I didn’t sleep whole night because when I wake up I forget what I studied. Can you tell any formula so I can retain everything even after sleep? reported a counsellor of a private school.
 
 Madhu Maini, principal, Jayshree Periwal High School, says that they have shared the helpline number with students and have encouraged them to call in any situation.
