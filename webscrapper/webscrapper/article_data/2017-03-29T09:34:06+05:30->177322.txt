BENGALURU: This time, students entering the   after 9.30am will lose out on their reading time of the  . The board has advised students to be inside the hall before 9.30am. However, late-comers will get 15 minutes extra, but none will be allowed to enter the hall after 9.45am, said Sowjanya, commissioner of Public Instruction on Tuesday. 

 Over 8 lakh students will appear for the exams slated to begin from Thursday at 2,770 centres across the state. 
 
  Sowjanya said this year, the timings have been tightened to avoid leak of question papers. "As only 1,184 centres have   cameras in the classrooms, the district commissioners have been asked to appoint special observers like tahsildars or revenue officials to pay surprise visits," she said. These officials will be appointed at 89 sensitive centres. 
 
  On having separate question and answer papers this year, Yashoda Bopanna, director,   said: "The change has been made to enable smooth transfer of papers to and from the exam centres. One custodian per exam centre has been appointed to keep account of the papers. Another advantage of having separate papers for answering is that if students wanted to correct an answer, there was never any place for it. They had to answer on the question paper itself . Now, they can write as much as they want freely on separate answersheets." 
 
  
 
 
  While there were over 3,000 ex am centres last year, there will be 2,770 this time. "We shut centres which did not have too many students and balanced it with equal number of students in different centres. Also, transporting papers to fewer centres is much safer than to many more of them," Yashoda said.
