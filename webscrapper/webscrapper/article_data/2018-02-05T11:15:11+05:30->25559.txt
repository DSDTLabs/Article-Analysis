 and American filmmaker   are all set with their next action adventure thriller titled 'Junglee' starring   in the lead. The film is an action thriller about a unique relationship between man and elephants.

  
  
 
 An exclusive still from the film was recently released. The picture features Vidyut along with his tusker friend Bhola in the scrim of a forest. A video was also released where Vidyut can be seen seeking the blessings of the Lord Ganesha. Watching him pay respect to the mighty tusker, Bhola, who is his co-star from the film is surely a treat to the sore eyes. 
 
  
  
 Vidyut essays the role of a vet, who, on his homecoming to his elephant reserve, encounters and fights an international poacher's racket. 'Junglee' is scheduled to release on October 19.
