DEHRADUN: A couple was killed when a car in which they were travelling in plunged into 250m deep gorge at Teen Dhara, near Devprayag, in   district on Monday morning.

 The car carrying three persons was on its way to Rishikesh from Agustmuni in   district when the fatal mishap occurred after the driver lost control over the vehicle.
 
 The deceased have been identified as Manoj Mittal and his wife  , both residents of Rudraprayag district. Both died on the spot, according to district authorities. The third person in the car, Atul Rawat, sustained serious injuries and has been shifted to nearby hospital for treatment. 
 
 “The accident took place at around 7:30am when the car was going towards Rishikesh. Prima facie it seems that the driver was over-speeding on the hill road which led to the accident,” said Brijest Bhatt, district disaster management officer.
