COIMBATORE: The district administration on Saturday called for schools and higher educational institutions to enrol themselves under the   Scheme so that students from minority religious communities could get scholarships.

 In a communication, the district collector said institutions of higher education, which offer vocational, polytechnic, UG and PG courses in technical and medicine courses, also M.Phil and research courses should register in the website of the All India Survey on Higher   (AISHE) – www.aishe.nic.in - under the ministry of human resources development and generate a user ID.
 
 The scholarship is given to students belonging to minority communities such as Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis, based on their school education and financial status.
 
 An official from the district administration said they had asked more than 120 government, government-aided and private higher education institutions in the district to enrol themselves in the AISHE portal.
 
 “While some institutions have been facilitating minority students to avail the scholarship, others are not even aware of the scholarship. We are trying to create awareness about it ,” he said.
