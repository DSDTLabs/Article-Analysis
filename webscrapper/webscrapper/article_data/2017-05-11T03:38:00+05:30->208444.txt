Aadditional chief engineer and nodal officer in the Mhadei matter, P J Kamat, is already in New Delhi with officials of the state’s water resources department. 
 
 Karnataka Niravari Nigam Limited has completed work on the Kalsa canal, through which it had planned to divert water from River Mhadei to the basin of the River Malaprabha. DRN Infra has also begun renovating the sacred tank in Kankumbi, which was damaged during work on the canal. Repairs of the adjoining temple hall, however, are yet to commence.
