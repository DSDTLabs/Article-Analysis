LUCKNOW: Chairman of the UP   Central   Board   on Thursday accused state waqf minister  , of selling endowment property in Safipur (Unnao district), including graves of his ancestors.

 Talking to reporters, Rizvi claimed Raza had sold off his ancestral land in Safipur through his mother and uncles in 2005, 2006 and 2011. Rizvi alleged that the said land registered as Waqf Aliya Begum in 1937 had four graves—of Raza’s great grandparents and grandparents. 
 
 “Supreme Court has ruled that a land with more than three graves is considered a cemetery, which, by nature is waqf and thus cannot be brought or sold but the Waqf minister, after giving power of attorney to his mother, executed three sale deeds for the 505 square metre land,” said Rizvi.
 
 The waqf body chairman claimed the report was drawn after a complaint was filed in 2015 and the Board in its recent meetings decided to use section 52 and 52 (A) of the Shia Waqf Act that seeks district administration’s support to reclaim waqf land and charge offender under a criminally non-bailable offence. He added that the chief minister was also informed about the case and he had assured an inquiry.
 
 Raza, on the other hand said the issue was baseless and charges were fabricated out of fear. “A CBI inquiry into both Sunni and Shia waqf boards has already been requested by the state government, so even this matter, if there is a grain of truth in it would be investigated. Waqf board chairman is just afraid of CBI probe and making baseless allegations to save his skin.” 
 
 In another matter, Rizvi also claimed that Raza had used his political influence to pressurise a complainant into taking back an FIR he had previously lodged alleging Raza with documents of forgery.
