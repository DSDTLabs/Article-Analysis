Guntur: The Guntur Municipal Corporation ( ) authorities are gearing up to take care of the drinking   needs of the city in the coming summer. Although the officials are confident of managing the situation effectively thanks to the expected capacity augmentation of the backup reservoirs, they are determined not to take chances and have started tightening the loose ends in the supply system.

 In fact, the water supply disruption in many colonies in the city in the last fortnight had put the authorities on their toes to plan things for the summer. 
 
 “We are preparing a detailed action plan for handling the drinking water needs of the summer season. We don’t see any problem in ensuring water supply to all colonies, including the newly-merged areas,” said GMC commissioner C Anuradha.
 
 The city is presently drawing about 110-120 Million Litres a Day (MLD) water from Prakasam barrage and supplying it to about 1 lakh connections both domestic and commercial. While the actual requirement is said to be anywhere around 140MLD, pumping of just around 110-120MLD is causing strain in the supply system. The residents of many colonies have been complaining about inadequate supplies, leaving the authorities in a tight spot.
