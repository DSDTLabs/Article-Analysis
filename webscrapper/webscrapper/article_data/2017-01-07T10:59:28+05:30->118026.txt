GANDHINAGAR: The state may have tightened the noose around tipplers by enforcing a stricter prohibition law, but the government has received a rather unusual proposal for setting up a vodka plant and distillery unit in 'dry' Gujarat.

 The proposal comes from a lesser known industrial house, SBM group, which has listed a   (MoU) to be signed at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.
 
 SBN Group has proposed to set up one vodka plant where the spirit will be made using potatoes grown abundantly in Gujarat and one distillery as part of its mega food park in Ahmedabad district involving estimated investment of Rs 5,000 crore.
 
 Among other planned facilities in the food park are cold storage chain, fruit and vegetable by-products manufacturing unit. The MoU has been filed under agro and food processing sector.
 
 All the investment intentions are first scrutinised by nodal officers responsible for different sectors under which the MoUs are filed.
 
 Despite several attempts, principal secretary of agriculture and cooperation, Sanjay Prasad, who is also incharge of state MoU coordination committee, could not be reached for his comment.
 
 As per the MoU details listed with the state government, the company has sought 150 acres land from the government for the food park.
 
 When contacted, B Kumar, director of prohibition, said, "Current laws prohibit production of any type of liquor in Gujarat. We have not yet received any application for a distillery."
