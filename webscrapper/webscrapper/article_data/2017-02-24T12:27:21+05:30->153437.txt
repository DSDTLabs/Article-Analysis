HYDERABAD: The first-ever combined living donor liver transplant and   on a five-year-old critically ill baby girl was conducted by  . After an extremely   and 12-hour observation period in the ICU on January 23, the liver transplant was performed with the help of 20 specialists from 10 different medical specialties.

 City girl   suffered from a rare genetic disorder called ‘Alagille Syndrome’ that led to advanced liver cirrhosis, severe cardiac defects, growth retardation and rickets. Parvati weighed just 10 kilograms, making the case complex. “Although she was mentally developed, she was not going to school or go out to play because of her susceptibility to fractures in leg bones due to rickets,” added Dr Varma. The disorder affects one in one lakh children.
 
 “Since both the heart and liver were in bad condition and every chance of the other giving away while performing surgery on one, put us in a severe dilemma. Had we attempted to perform liver transplant with a bad heart, she was at risk of dying in the operation theatre while if we tried to correct the heart alone, she was at a very high risk of dying after the heart surgery,” explained Dr Manish C Varma, head of the Liver Transplant Department, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills.
 
 With no precedence in medical history to fall back upon and after a failed attempt at correcting the cardiac defect by endovascular balloon dilatation, the surgeries were performed in quick succession. “We could attempt this only because we had a living donor transplantation option in her 32-year-old mother Prerna Rohra, as her liver was a perfect match for the baby,” added Dr Varma. The baby was discharged on February 7.
