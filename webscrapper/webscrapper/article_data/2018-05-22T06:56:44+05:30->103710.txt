BENGALURU: An argument on a WhatsApp group of an apartment complex in   near   in east Bengaluru ended up in a police complaint and counter-complaint after members of two families got into a physical fight. While the incident happened on May 15, Byappanahalli police received the complaint on May 18.

 On May 15, Ragini (name changed), 54, requested for a meeting to discuss security at her apartment complex through a message on a WhatsApp group for residents. Rachel’s (name changed) husband Arun, 28, who is the group administrator, responded that security personnel will be on duty only from 6am to 10pm.
 
  
  
 An irritated Ragini told Arun to behave himself, to which Arun wrote: “Mind your language lady... don’t talk rubbish.” The conversation in the WhatsApp group ended with this message. 
 
 Minutes later, Ragini and her son   landed up outside Arun’s house and they allegedly banged on his door, calling the couple “cowards refusing to open the door”. When Arun and Rachel opened the door, the mother and son allegedly entered the house and created a ruckus, making Arun’s year-old baby cry. This forced Arun to force them out of his house. According to Rachel’s complaint, “Ragini and Kaushik began beating Arun outside their house and when she intervened to save him, Kaushik even pulled her dress and jostled her.”
 
 While Rachel lodged an assault and molestation case, Ragini, in her complaint, accused Arun of molesting her. “I only went there seeking some respect. I told the man I am as old as his mother and that he should talk to me with respect. Arun, however, not only used foul language but also touched me inappropriately,” Ragini said. Byappanahalli police said it was too early to establish whose claims are true but are looking into both complaints.
