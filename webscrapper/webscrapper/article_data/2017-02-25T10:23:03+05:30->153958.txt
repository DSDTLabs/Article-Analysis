INDORE: Recent guidelines by   ( ) on school children’s safety in school buses came as a relief to worried parents across the city, especially after recent incidents of school bus accidents and molestation cases involving bus conductors and drivers.

 Emphasizing that these guidelines should be ‘scrupulously followed and complied with’, the board stated that the management and head of CBSE-affiliated schools will be held responsible for any lapse in this regard, inviting appropriate action including disaffiliating the school.
 
 “The recent unfortunate instances reported in the media about the callous approach by certain schools with respect to the safety of school children have brought up a deep concern regarding the safety of school children. The time has come to make schools sensitive to this serious issue and to take proactive remedial measures to ensure that safe transport for school children becomes paramount for every CBSE affiliated school,” read the circular by the board.
 
 Schools in the city claimed that they have been following all the board’s guidelines while parents still complain about the unavailability of female attendants and   cameras on many school buses.
 
 “The board has clearly said that school management, principals, parents and   members will be responsible for any mishap with kids on school buses. Schools need to comply with the set guidelines or else they will have to lose their affiliation with the board,” said Jaydeb Kar, CBSE affiliated counselor.
 
 Parents in the city welcomed the move and said strict guidelines would help ensure the safety of school kids while they travel on school buses.
 
 “It is an alarming situation now and these repeated incidents of child abuse or accidents in school buses should stop now. Not only schools but parents should also take note of the behaviour of drivers and conductors and should regularly take feedback from their kids,” said Shalini Gangrade, a mother of two from the city.
