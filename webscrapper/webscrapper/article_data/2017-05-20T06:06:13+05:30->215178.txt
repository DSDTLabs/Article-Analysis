THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With more than 15,000 applications pending with the   and more piling up daily, the government is planning to bring the issue to the notice of the advocate general and facilitate the appointment of five  , which is currently caught in a legal tangle. 

 On a submission by Congress leader   in the assembly on Friday, law minister A K Balan, in the absence of the chief minister, said the delay in filling up the vacancies was not 'intentional', but due to 'legal problems'. "As suggested by the member (Satheesan), the government will inform the   and try for a speedy action," he said. 
 
 Elaborating on the situation which led to the non-filling of all the five posts of information commissioners after they fell vacant since 2005, Balan said the selection by the previous   government during the end of its tenure had procedural lapses. "Though the selected panel (of commissioners) secured a favourable decision from a high court single bench, the government filed a writ appeal before the division bench and secured a stay. The case in now pending before the court," he said.
