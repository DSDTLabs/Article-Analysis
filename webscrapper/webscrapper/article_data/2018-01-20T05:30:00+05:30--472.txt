Mysuru: Levelling allegations of flouting   to provide a 2 acre plot worth Rs 25 crore for the construction of an   in Devanoor I stage, members of the Mysore Rakshana Vedike hit out at primary education minister Tanveer Sait and accused   (MUDA) officials and elected representatives of being hand-in-glove with Sait in usurping   land, here on Friday.

 Accusing Sait of using his political clout to obtain the land, M A Mohan of the Mysore Rakshana Vedike said, “The Congress party is known for its corruption. Sait is trying to unlawfully obtain land worth over Rs 25 crore. He had applied to obtain the 2-acre plot in Devanoor I stage, to build an Azeez Sait community hall ,where MUDA had developed 36 residential sites on an area of around 84,000 sq ft in 2013, and got it sanctioned by unscientific and unlawful means, by throwing to wind bylaws of the MUDA.” 
 
 Hitting out at the MUDA for not distributing the sites and sanctioning it to Sait unlawfully, he said, “Over Rs 1 crore was spent by the MUDA 20 years ago, to develop a layout. The market value of the land today is over Rs 25 crore. The residential sites were allotted to people, but they were never handed over to them. The MUDA has compensated the beneficiaries by providing them sites at a different place. However, only civic amenity (CA) sites can be allotted for construction of a community hall, but MUDA officials and elected representatives who are hand in glove with Sait, are allotting residential sites to build a community hall, which is deplorable. We are not against the construction of the Azeez Sait Bhavana, our only contention is that it be built on a CA site as per the rules. If MUDA goes ahead and grants permission to construct this community hall, we will file a complaint with the ACB and bring a stay order from the court against the project,” he added.
