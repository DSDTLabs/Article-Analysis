   The track, composed by   Puranik, reveals a new facet to Jonita’s voice. She says, “I always enjoy singing in my lower register. I feel that in Bollywood especially, people don’t use female lower registers enough — they like doing the whole high thing, which is nice but not in every context.”    She adds, “This song is unique and has a message about female empowerment, and that is something I am proud to be associated with.”    Prashant, the director-producer of ‘Budh’, who’s also the lyricist of the song says, “This track is a discussion between the mind and a heart — there is always a contradiction between both. And when you get to the hook-line, you realise that’s what its talking about. The mind is communicating with the heart and that is the USP of this song.” Prashant has also penned ‘Malhari’ (‘Bajirao Mastani’), ‘Mary Kom’ and others.
    Shreyas adds, “Composing for the short film was a great experience. It is a very emotional movie and talks about issues that women go through- there are three different stories going on. Prashant had already written the lyrics, which was so emotional that in 15 minutes we cracked the song. It was right from the heart.” Shreyas had earlier composed ‘Gajanana’ from the film ‘Bajirao Mastani’ and also assistant music director of the film ‘Padmavat’. He also composed for the Marathi film, ‘Photocopy’.
