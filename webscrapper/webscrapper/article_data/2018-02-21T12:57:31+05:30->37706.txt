QUEPEM: Twenty illegal houses built on land belonging to the comunidade at Pedamoll in Sirvoi were demolished on Tuesday morning. The demolition was carried out under the supervision of a strong pose of police from Quepem, Sanguem, Canacona, Curchorem and Margao. 

 Administrator of comunidade,   zone,   had issued the demolition order, which was monitored by the executive magistrate and the Quepem mamlatdar in the presence Quepem DySP Uttam   and all PIs and police of the Quepem sub division.
 
 The comunidade attorney identified the houses before the demolition, which started at around 10.30am and went on till 4pm without any untoward incident.Two excavators were used. The encroachers, some of who have school-going children who stayed at home on Tuesday, pleaded with officials against the demolition of their houses. Despite being informed about the order by the police on Monday afternoon and asked to vacate their houses, many had not removed their belongings. Prior to the demolition, labourers from the PWD cleared the houses.
 
 A total of 146 illegal houses have been built on comunidade land, but only 20, those without water and power connections, were razed. Dessai told TOI that the 20 houses had been demolished after being given a proper hearing in the administrator court. He also said that notices had been issued to the encroachers three months back.
 
 When asked about the fate of other illegal houses, Dessai said those encroachers had gone in for an appeal in the administrative tribunal. He added that the demolition of the remaining illegal houses is on the cards and will be undertaken soon.
 
 Hoping for respite, the Pedamoll encroachers had approached   earlier Tuesday morning. Cabral, however, told them that he could not save their houses.
