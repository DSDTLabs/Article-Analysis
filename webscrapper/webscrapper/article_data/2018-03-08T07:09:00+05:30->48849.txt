 Speaking about the initiative, Jha said, “So far our journey from plating the first sapling and achieving such great success has been really remarkable and along with planting thousands of saplings in Ludhiana, we have also been able to inspire a large number of people to do something for the environment specially in the wake of increasing pollution in the city and decreasing number of trees.” 
 
 After starting the initiative in July 2017, several vertical gardens have been set up in the city with the biggest ones in the   office of the I-T department and at Gurudwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib. In addition to vertical gardens, more than 600 tax trees were also planted in various government and private schools of the city under the campaign.
