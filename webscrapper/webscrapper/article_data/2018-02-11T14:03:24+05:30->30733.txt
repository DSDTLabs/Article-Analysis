TRICHY: It is unlikely that many have heard about  , the hobby of collecting   and matchboxes. Throwing light on the history of   and their association with people, an   -- touted to be the first of its kind in Tamil Nadu -- was held at the Government Museum in Trichy on Sunday.

 Unlike the familiar hobbies such as philately and numismatics involving the collections of postal stamps and currencies, phillumeny remains a least known hobby. Philumenists in Trichy said the labels were equally important to study the vernacular culture. 
 
 “Till the 1980s matchbox was a significant product in every household. To attract the attention of users, match producers carried vibrant matchbox covers displaying the portraits of political leaders like former chief minister M G Ramachandran (MGR),” said P Vijayakumar, a Trichy-based philumenist who hosted the exhibition. 
 
 Some old matchbox labels would help people learn about the old coins like annas. 
 
 Matchbox labels had spread patriotism among people during pre-independence era by displaying the portrait of freedom fighters like Subash Chandra Bose, philumenists said.
 
 As many as 3,000 matchbox labels were on display.
