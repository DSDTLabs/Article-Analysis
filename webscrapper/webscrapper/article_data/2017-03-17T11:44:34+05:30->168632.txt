Adi wants to play Holi with Aaliya alone and get romantic with her. Ruhi and Adi then pull Raman and Ishita on stage. The two dance together.
 
  Nidhi serves bhaang and asks the waiter to make sure Raman and Ishita drink it. Raman and Romi on the other hand make Ishita drink bhaang so that she tells them about the forger. Raman, Romi and Ishita get high.
  
  All start behaving weird and funny after drinking bhaang. Raman tries to ask Ishita about who forged Ruhi's signature but she doesn't tell him anything. Nidhi is trying to hear their conversation but gets irritated as they don't talk about anything as planned.
  
  
 
  
  Ishita falls in the pool and pulls Raman in there. Nidhi decides to take both of them inside the house and ask them directly.
  
  Pihu, on the other side is posting Holi pictures on social media and chatting with somebody she thinks is Gulabo. Pihu tells him about Raman's secret and the kidnapper pretends to be Raman and asks her to not tell anyone about their online chat.
