NEW DELHI: India has asked UK to take action against persons who allegedly tore down the Indian flag protesting PM Narendra Modi’s visit in London in the backdrop of reports pro-Pakistan   groups were part of the demonstrations. 

 On Wednesday some protesters at   pulled down the Indian tricolour from the official flagpoles set up for all 53 Commonwealth countries to mark the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). 
 
 The perpetrators, caught on camera, were some pro-Khalistani demonstrators along with Kashmiri separatists under the banner of the so-called ‘Minorities Against Modi’ group, led by Pakistani-origin peer Lord Nazir Ahmed. 
 
 The protestors also included those campaigning against a Sterlite copper plant in   and activists including a Southhall group that claims to represent Asian and   women. “We are deeply anguished with the incident involving our national flag and assault on an Indian journalist at Parliament Square in London. We expect action, including legal, against the persons involved in the incident and their instigators,” said a MEA spokesperson. 
 
 According to news agencies, a UK Foreign and   spokesperson said the UK government had been in touch with the Indian high commission soon after the incident. BBC apologises: BBC on Friday apologised for mistakenly referring to Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena as Indian Prime Minister   in a live news broadcast of the CHOGM.
