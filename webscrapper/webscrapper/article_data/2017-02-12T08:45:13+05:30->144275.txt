AHMEDABAD: Seven months after   shook the conscience of the nation, the   is all set to issue identity cards to dalits involved in business of cow-skinning. A Government Resolution (GR) in this regard will be issued soon. 

 "We have decided to issue identity cards to those involved in the trade of skinning cows and other animals. This will prevent anti-social elements from harassing and targeting dalits involved in animal skinning. A notification in this regard will be issued soon," said Atmaram Parmar, minister for social justice and empower (including welfare of scheduled castes, welfare of socially and educationally backward classes).
 
 "The I-cards will be issued by talatis at village level as well as the social welfare department," said Parmar, adding that there were many representations from those who wish to continue in the trade of skinning as tannery is a profitable business.
 
 Cow skinners, however, doubted that I-cards will curb attacks but said it will amount to their further branding. The demanded government's focus should be reining cow vigilantism and curbing activities of self-styled gau rakshaks instead.
 
 Balu Sarvaiya, along with his four sons was brutally flogged by Gaurakshaks in Una on July 11 last year.
