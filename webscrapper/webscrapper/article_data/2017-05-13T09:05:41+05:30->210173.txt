CHARMINAR: The Majlis Bachao Tahreek (MBT) has sought to know whether the TRS has given a go-ahead to one A S Rao to speak at   on a Friday during the holy month of  . 

 Rao, who, in his letter to the   (MWD), claimed to be a senior TRS leader, recently applied for permission to speak at Mecca Masjid. 
 
 MBT leader Amjedullah Khan said that he was suspicious of the move. "The third Friday of Ramzan is traditionally allotted to MBT where we primarily speak about Muslims and religious issues. I wonder why he has asked for the third Friday slot ," he said, adding that the TRS leadership should 'come clean' on the issue. Religious leaders said that they found the request 'strange'. One such leader, Maulana Mohammed Husamuddin Sani, said that while there is no stopping someone from speaking about the Prophet in a reverential manner, the time and place chosen by Rao should be looked into. 
 
 "Some non-Muslims have written beautiful books about Prophet Mohammed. If this gentleman wanted to speak about the Prophet, he could have done so at any venue. However, this request of speaking at the Mecca Masjid on a Friday during the holy month is strange," he said.
 
 TRS leaders did not wish to comment on the issue. A party leader who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the party does not wish to enter into religious discourse at Mecca Masjid. 
 
 "For several years the MIM and MBT have been delivering speeches at Mecca Masjid. We have no such intention. I will have to look into the application and I am not aware of any A S Rao," said the leader.
