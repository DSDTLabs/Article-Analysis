JABALPUR: A 20-year-old youth was feared drowned in   in   while trying to save his cousin, who fell into the raging waters while taking a selfie. 

 Dhuandhar gets its name from the power of the waterfall as it thunders down sheer escarpments and churns up rapids. The government has barricaded the cliff edge and created a view point to keep visitors safe.
 
 It was here that 18-year-old Nagpur girl   and her mother  , 45, were standing on Wednesday afternoon to take in the sights. They were in the city for a wedding and Shelly's Jabalpur-based cousin   had accompanied them to the falls.
 
  When Shelly was taking selfies at view point, she dropped her cell phone. In a desperate bid to catch it, she tumbled over the railings and into the raging waterfall. Panicked,   jumped in after her, followed by Rohan. Rescue driver Guru Thakur managed to save Rewati and Shelly but failed to locate Rohan. Divers were still looking for him when this report was filed. The mother and daughter are in hospital.
