KANNAUJ: The meandering   had, for generations, been covered on foot by villagers of  , till two year ago. That was when the expressway came close to this  , allowing vehicles to not just zoom past but come wheeling into the interiors.

 “Previously there were only a few tractors owned by one or two people. Others had to hire them for using on fields and sending their final produce to the market. Now there are more than 10 tractors and 80-90 motorbikes here,” said Phool Singh. Singh’s own one bigha land, which was acquired for the expressway, fetched him Rs 6,20,000. Three years ago, he had been offered just Rs 27,000 for the same land by another farmer, he claimed. 
 
 Elsewhere, Shiva Rajput’s white SUV is flanked by two buffaloes tied to a hook in his small courtyard. The SUV was bought from the compensation for his three bighas of field. The only one to have a four wheeler in the village, Shiva uses it not just for taking his family to cities that were once out of reach but rents it out to villagers. So the SUV doubles up as an ambulance in case of a medical emergency or a mini traveller for marriage parties. “Not even the villagers thought there could be a four wheeler here. I let people use it at about Rs 500 for a trip,” Shiva said. 
 
 In a population of close to 2,000, fields of around 100 big and small farmers were acquired for the project. For farmer Rambir, it has become easier to take his potato produce to the market as he has his own tractor. “I had to hire a tractor for at least Rs 250 per trip and I needed to make at least three trips,” he said. “I am also using the tractor for tilling my land which I did by hand previously,” he added. 
 
 According to farmers, owning their own tractors has come as a major relief. Previously, while they had to take their produce to markets in Bihar, Gorakhpur, Ballia, Lucknow, Varanasi and Kanpur on a rented tractor or through middlemen, it is now being done directly, helping them save up the extra cost.
