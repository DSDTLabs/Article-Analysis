ERODE:   state deputy general secretary   said that her party will extend support to caretaker chief minister   if governor (in-charge) C H   asks him to prove his majority in a floor test in the assembly. 

 After inaugurating DMK’s union office in   on Thursday, Subbulakshmi told reporters that her party wished OPS to continue as the chief minister. “DMK working president M K Stalin and former minister Duraimurugan have also confirmed this on many occasions, even during the assembly session,” she said.
 
 The former minister of state for social justice and empowerment also urged OPS to take care of his supporting MLAs during the floor test. “If needed, DMK will extend its support to OPS at the time of floor test,” she said, adding that DMK would not expect anything from OPS in return. 
 
 Recalling incidents of horse-trading after the demise of former chief minister MGR, Subbulakshmi said Jayalalithaa took all her supporting MLAs in a bus to an undisclosed location. “Now, the same trend has taken place,” she said, adding that Gobichettipalayam MLA K A Sengottaiyan was the only person who has seen all the ‘tamasha’ on both times.
 
 Subbulakshmi lamented that the state government has not functioned from the day one of Jayalalithaa’s hospitalization. “It’s very hard to find a solution for even a small issue,” she lamented.
 
 Disowning Subbulakshmi’s statement, DMK working president M K Stalin said the views expressed by her on floor test were her personal views. In a press release, Stalin said decisions on such issues would be taken only after discussing with DMK president and general secretary. “I urge all the party functionaries not to issue such kind of statements to media,” Stalin said.
 
 When contacted by TOI to get her reaction, Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan was not reachable.
