BHUBANESWAR: There's something wrong with  . The Kerala girl has now withdrawn twice in the last one month midway through an 800m race. With the Asian and   coming up next year, it's not good news for India.

 Luka was the favourite to win the event.The race was going as per script, with Luka taking the lead right from the start. She kept the lead till the bell but started falling back and after covering another 100m, she pulled out.
 
 In a way, it seemed like a repeat of what happened in the Federation Cup in Patiala last month. There too, Luka had taken the lead but collapsed on the track after covering some 300m. According to reports, Luka had complained of breathlessness and doctors reportedly said that Luka had suffered a heat stroke. Her coach   said it was a combination of heat and low blood pressure, which resulted in the Olympian suffering a blackout. However, on Sunday, Usha was seen rushing to her pupil, who was stretchered out by the medical team. "She had fever since morning and was feeling weak," the Olympian said, but failed to clear the air over Luka's participation here on Sunday.
