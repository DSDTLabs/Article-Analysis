As Bengaluru woke up to the news of musician   Petty’s passing away due to a cardiac arrest at the age of 66, it was a rude shock as many city folk have grown up listening to his songs. For most singer-songwriters, his songs have been special. Some of the city’s singers recall how doing his covers always brought a special connect with the audience.

  Siganporia of Best Kept Secret says Tom will remain special to him for a reason. “One of my first covers was an acoustic version of Free Fallin’, which our band put up as a video online. His songs and lyrics are an inspiration to any singer-songwriter and they will all admit it. Personally, I love Learning To Fly and Into The Great Wide Open are my favourites,” says Behram. 
 
 Singer   also admits to singing his popular songs like Free Fallin’ and I Won’t Back Down at gigs. But talking about what has hurt him the most, he says, “I’m heartbroken that I missed seeing him live last year at a gig. I was supposed to go, but couldn’t make it. His music and songs have influenced many and everyone has taken different things out of it. He will remain a good influence for many singers to come. American Girl will remain my personal favourite.”
