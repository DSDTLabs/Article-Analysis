NEW DELHI: South Delhi dog owners who don’t lift their pets’ poo should be prepared to pay hefty fines to the corporation as the latter has come up with a proposal to instil civic sense among people. 

 South corporation mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat said sanitation workers would charge the penalty. She said that although a policy hasn’t been framed yet, but the penalty amount wouldn’t be below Rs 500. The corporation would also parallely start a   registration programme.
 
 
  
 
 In countries abroad, fine for not lifting pet poop is really steep. It’s $113 (Rs 7,500) in New York, 600 euros (Rs 44,700) in Paris and up to £1,000 (Rs 86,000) in London. The   had already advised pet owners in 2015 to either   up or to participate in other solutions to ensure cleanliness of public areas. It asked pet owners to discuss with colony committees ways to dispose of excreta.
 
 Chetan Sharma, the general secretary of confederation of NCR RWAs and GK-II resident said the move is good but the corporation should also work towards providing the alternatives. “Eight years ago, we started a small sand bed corner in the local park for dog use. But the then MCD removed it as ‘encroachment’. South corporation should come out with a scheme to develop such places, may be near dhalaos,” Sharma said. 
 
 Gauri Maulekhi from ‘People for Animals’ said the corporation’s priorities are misplaced: “People should be encouraged to carry scoop bags and clean up. Penal provisions are not the way to go forward. Awareness should be generated.”
 
 It might seem a small violation but dog faeces poses a serious disease threat. Studies have indicated that a gram of dog faeces contains over 20 million E coli bacteria, while roundworm eggs can remain active in the soil long   the poo disappears. Roundworms can cause upset stomach, sore throat, asthma and blindness with children being most at risk. Pet waste also carries parasites like hookworms, ring worms, salmonella and tapeworms.
