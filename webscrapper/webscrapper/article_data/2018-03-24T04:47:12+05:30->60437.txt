MUMBAI: Transporters in Mumbai have strongly opposed the traffic police restrictions for entry of trucks in   from 7am to midnight, saying this has hit their business drastically. They have warned that the cost of consumer goods could escalate by 25-30%. 

 "We have given an ultimatum and want the government to lift vehicle entry restrictions by March 31," said   (BGTA) president Vijay Rawal. The BGTA on Friday petitioned chief minister   in this regard and threaten protests after March 31.
 
 A source in traffic police said that vehicle restrictions were part of a state notification from February 1 and helped reduce congestion in south Mumbai in view of ongoing Metro construction work.
 
 Rawal said that mathadi workers who offload goods were not available for night duties, from 12am to 7am-when trucks are allowed to enter south Mumbai. "We have to pay them double the normal charge and this escalates the overall costs for traders by 25-30%-the burden for which will go to consumers," he pointed out.
 
 Amrit Lal Madan from All India Motor Transport Congress said that nearly 10 lakh trucks arrived in Mumbai region from across the country. Goods were offloaded in Masjid Bunder, Carnac Bunder, Dongri and Girgaum. "These goods are later redistributed across state in Navi Mumbai, Thane and as far as Solapur. So, we have proposed that a truck terminal should be set up for all trucks somewhere in Bhiwandi," he said.
