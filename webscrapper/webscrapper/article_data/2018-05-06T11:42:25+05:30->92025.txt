CHANDIGARH: Residents have urged the UT administration to lift the embargo on allowing owners of   to   them for obtaining loans for different purposes.

 There are a large number of propertiesâ€” residential, commercial and industrial, which have been allotted by the UT administration on lease for 99 years. There are around 50,000 such properties in different parts of the city. The ban has also impacted the sale of leasehold properties as the buyer is forced make the entire payment from his own resources.   Association of Chandigarh,   and   has submitted a representation to the finance secretary.
 
 
  
 
 Kamaljit Singh Panchi, chairman of the association, said residents are unable to take loans when in need for money as the leasehold properties cannot be mortgaged. He further stated the administration should lift the ban keeping in view public interest at large. The association has also requested the administration for allowing habitable use of basements in commercial buildings. In the new rules which were notified last year, the administration had withdrawn habitable use of basements in all categories, in view of fire hazards and for disaster risk reduction.
 
 Earlier, the habitable use of basements of shop-cum-offices (SCOs) was permissible with certain conditions such as two staircases and the basement should be fully air conditioned. At present, basements can be used only for storage. The residents are also pressing for abolishing 3% stamp duty on general power of attorney with powers to sell within blood relations. Collector rates in Chandigarh are considerably higher than those prevailing in Panchkula and Mohali. The collector rate is the lowest at which a property is registered. It is fixed by administration and revised every year.
 
 The administration had recently reduced collector rates by just 10% and 5% in commercial and residential categories, respectively.
