NEW DELHI: During the five-Test series before the New Year's, England made totals of 537, 400 and 477 and failed to beat India. In the first ODI last Sunday in Pune, England made 350 and lost with   and   making batting look ridiculously easy from the depths of 63/4. Stopping India from running away with the best-of-three series appears a very tough task for  's team, as they head into the second match in Cuttack on Thursday.

 Since that stunning victory led by Kohli and Jadhav, both teams had to remain in Pune to train owing to a scheduling conflict, and there have been plenty of comments from both camps about the partnership the two batsmen had in the series opener. England will have to be on the money to curb Kohli, Jadhav and the other big Indian batsmen, and the reported dew factor at Cuttack's Barabati Stadium could be crucial. 
 
 According to the head curator, the dew begins to come into play by 5:30pm IST and work is one to negate it. The last time an ODI was played at the venue in 2014, India racked up 363/5 and hammered Sri Lanka by 169 runs for a 5-0 sweep.

 Shikhar Dhawan's comeback innings was worth one run off ten balls, and it is likely that he makes way for Ajinkya Rahane, who scored a fluent 91 when leading India A against an England XI last week. Yuvraj Singh's first ODI in over three years produced 15 runs, but the two fours and six that he hit were indication that he's got something to offer. Umesh Yadav conceded 63 runs in seven overs in Pune, and may be benched in favour of Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

 Adil Rashid was pasted in India's spectacular chase of 351, bleeding 50 runs in five overs. Should he be dropped, Liam Dawson would step right in. England's batsmen did little wrong in posting 350/7, wth only Alex Hales failing with 9 off 18 balls.

 “I play every game thinking it could be my last. Whenever you represent your country, you have to give more than 100 per cent so I try and make sure every time I get to bat, I will give more than 100 per cent." - 
 
 
 “He's [Kohli] an unbelievable player. We saw a lot of him in the Tests and he started the ODI series really well. We've got plans for him and, hopefully, we can put them into practice.” -
