GHAZIABAD: In a mjaor fire, seven shanties and two scrap godowns were gutted near Kailash hospital on   road on Tuesday at 1.15am. The blaze left two women with serious burn injuries. The reason behind the fire could not be ascertained. 

 The victims, identified as Rukjan (19) and her mother   (45) suffered 40 percent and 70 percent burn injuries respectively. The victims were trapped inside as the entry door caught fire. However, the duo were rescued by the neighbours who tried dousing off the flames with buckets of water.
 
 The victims were rushed to   where they are currently undergoing treatment.
 
 As many as three fire tenders were pressed into service, and they took around two hours to douse the fire. “ Since the shanties are made up of dry material, the fire spread much more rapidly. All of them are poor people hence, no loss of wealth was recorded but the scrap in two godowns along with the meagre belongings of the slum dwellers were completely charred,” said  , Fire Station Officer, Kotwali Fire Station.
