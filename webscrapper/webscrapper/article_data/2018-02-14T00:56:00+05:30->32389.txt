Udhagamandalam: Two female tiger cubs were found dead by forest officials at Masinagudi range in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris on Tuesday.

 The officials said the cubs would be about two weeks old. “The patrol team heard screams of a carnivore and a cub near Bilsona Saragam. The team rushed to the spot and found partially-eaten carcasses of the cubs,” said Srinivas R Reddy, field director of MTR.
 
 The mother tiger and, at least, one more cub must have fled the spot when the team reached the spot, said the director. “A male tiger might have killed the cubs while defending its territory or to mate the mother. But the kills were not for food. This kind of killings are common in reserves,” he added.
 
 After government veterinarian Pon Kalaivani conducted the postmortem as per the guidelines of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the carcasses were burnt inside the forest area.
