HYDERABAD: With stress emerging as one of the leading causes of   among techies, doctors are recommending more than just medication to treat the disease. Be it laughter therapy or regular yoga classes, IT professionals are adopting new ways to cope with the   issue.

 “Anxiety and depression go hand-in-hand irrespective of the cause of anxiety. From work-related stress to career anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders, stress can take many forms. The most effective way to reduce stress is to elevate a person’s serotonin levels, which is the chemical responsible for regulating anxiety levels,” said Dr Shiva Raju, consultant physician at KIMS Hospital. 
 
 According to doctors, physical activities that release endorphin are most effective in treating stress. “Stress management is key when it comes to fighting depression,” said Dr Anitha Are, clinical psychologist at   in Serilingampalli. She added that nearly 30% of her patients are IT professionals. 
 
 “Laughter induces release of endorphins, which act like painkillers. This easy method is being recommended to many time-pressed professionals. Endorphins are also released when one goes out for a walk and interacts with the various elements of nature. Even a 20-minute walk in the open can do wonders,” she said.
 
 Nalini Nagalla, senior consultant pulmonology,  , said that most of her patients were IT professionals who complained of feeling depressed or irritable. Nagalla also conducted a survey of 1,000 sleep-deprived techies in the city. “Nearly 50% of them admitted to feeling depressed. Stress and anxiety can get aggravated by lack of sleep. Sleep therapy is an essential supportive treatment,” said Nagalla. Yoga too has emerged as an effective treatment option, said doctors.
