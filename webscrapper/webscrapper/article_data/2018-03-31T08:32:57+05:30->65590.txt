CHENNAI: Former Maruti Suzuki MD Jagdish   -promoted multi-brand car service company Carnation, which is currently going through an insolvency resolution process, has found new investors willing to take over the business. According to the resolution professional Arvind  , Mumbai-based car service startup Carcrew and Gurugram-based internet and e-commerce company Smile group have shown interest in Carnation. 

 "The expressions of interest have come and the new investors eager to take over the company will begin due diligence soon," said Garg. The creditors to the company have also committed a working capital infusion of Rs 1.5 crore, which will be put in by next week. 
 
  The entire insolvency resolution process was delayed when the earlier resolution professional, Mukesh Mohan Gupta, resigned in February. Garg took over two weeks ago. "There was some degree of demoralisation among the staff and the franchisees as a result of which the cash flow was reduced,'' said Garg. 
 
  With the committee of creditors and the resolution professional arranging Rs 1.5 crore, some of the uncertainty plaguing the business should go away, he said. The earlier six-month deadline having lapsed, the company has now received a three-month extension. "We will wrap up the resolution process in that time," said Garg. 
 
 Already, an information memorandum on the present status of the company has been issued and sources say there are other investors too in the fray, apart from Carcrew and Smile. Carcrew was recently in the news when it raised $500,000 in angel funding led by the TVS group. The Smile group runs a whole bunch of e-commerce and internet businesses. One of its group companies, SVG Media, was acquired by Dentsu Aegis last year.
 
 The corporate insolvency resolution process was initiated against Carnation by its creditor Punjab National Bank. Carnation was formed in a blaze of high-profile investments in 2008-09 after Khattar retired from Maruti Suzuki.
