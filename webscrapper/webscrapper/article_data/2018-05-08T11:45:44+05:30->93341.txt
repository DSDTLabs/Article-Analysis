MARGAO: Smarting under accusations that haphazard development activities were harming the biodiversity of the state, minister for town and country planning ( )   Sardesai on Monday said that he was willing to “freeze” all development in   if there was unanimity over such demand. 

 Speaking at a cluster meeting for biodiversity management councils of Salcete held by the Goa state biodiversity board at the Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex,   dared the councils to pressurize their MLAs to raise the issue in the House. 
 
 “The debate should rather be on what Salcete wants,” Sardesai said. “I give you an open offer – if you feel that that real estate development is leading to killing of biodiversity, we will freeze Salcete, as it is today. I can do that. The accusation is that the minister is taking money for giving approvals; (if that’s so) let’s stop giving approvals to everything.” 
 
 What triggered Sardesai’s statement was a remark made by a speaker who spoke ahead of him at the meeting that rampant construction activities in the villages were harming their biodiversity. 
 
 “This is my challenge for the biodiversity councils in Salcete – pressurize your MLAs if you unanimously feel so, and I assure you of doing that (freezing development),” Sardesai added. 
 
 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines, Sardesai criticized Goencho Avaaz for failing to provide documentary evidence against whom they had accused of illegally converting lands into settlements at a public meeting in Margao recently. 
 
 “When asked to point what is wrong in the regional plan, they are not forthcoming to do so,” Sardesai said. “They just make accusations and fail to provide evidence. Does it work that way?... Over one lakh sq m of land was illegally converted and sold as subdivided plots over the last five years to unsuspecting migrants. That is the biggest scam, but there was no Avaaz at that time.”
