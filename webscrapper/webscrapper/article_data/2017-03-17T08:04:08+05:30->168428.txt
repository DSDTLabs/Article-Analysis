KOCHI: The  , inaugurated in February, 2016, with much fanfare, is moving at a snail's pace. The project could provide connections to just around 100 households so far.

 In Bengaluru, where the work on city gas project started along with Kochi, PNG connections were given to around 2,000 households. “We have connected lines to another 20,000 households. But the gas supply has not been given so far. We will soon be supplying PNG to those households as well,“ said an official associated city gas project in Bengaluru.
 
 Though the   (IOAGPL) officials claim that they are not facing any issues, it is learnt that the agency couldn't secure road cutting sanctions from many local bodies and agencies which own roads.
 
 Mini Somadasan, councillor, Kalamassery municipality, said they haven't given connections to households where cutting of PWD road is required. “It is learnt that they have certain issues regarding securing permissions for cutting roads,“ she said.
 
 IOCAGPL officials said that they have secured permissions for road cutting and are not facing any such issues. “Now, we are focusing on laying of pipelines. That's why we couldn't provide more connections,“ said an official with IOCAGPL. Once the main ring pipeline is completed, the number of connections would go up, he said.
 
 According to sources associated with the city gas project, the IOCAGPL couldn't sort out differences in fixing compensation and floor rent for digging up roads and laying pipes with some of the agencies like Roads and   of Kerala (RBDCK). “The IOCAGPL also approached Kochi corporation requesting permission for digging roads and laying cables. The file is pending with the corporation,“ sources with the local body said.
