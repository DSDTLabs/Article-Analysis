Nagpur: A special Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) court on Monday extended the police custody remand (PCR) of Prashant  , his wife Bhagyashree, brother Vinay, and brother-in-law Abhijeet Chaudhary, till Friday.

 The move came after special public prosecutor (SPP) Kalpana Pande demanded extension in PCR on behalf of the investigation agency, contending that they wanted to interrogate two other persons in connection with the scam in the presence of the accused. Counsels Shyam Dewani, Kailash Dodani, Chaitanya Barve and Harshal Puranik, arguing for the accused, strongly opposed the demand contending that prosecution failed to make any progress in investigations after first PCR was granted last Monday. 
 
 They argued that the second offence was registered about 18 months back on same allegations like first FIR, for which all of them have already been behind bars for three years. Even the papers of all their properties and even jewellery were seized by the police in first offence and nothing was left with them now. They further pointed out that other accused in the complaint had already been released on anticipatory bail.
 
 The prosecution moved the court regarding second offence lodged at Ambazari police station on December 29, 2015. The complainant alleged that she was duped of over Rs1 crore by the accused, who ran various Ponzi schemes under umbrella of ‘Wasankar Wealth Management Limited’.
 
 On complaints by builder Vivek Pathak and scores of aggrieved depositors, all four were put behind bars on July 27, 2014. Pegged as one of the biggest such schemes in Maharashtra, the amount involved is believed to be over Rs1,500 crore with more than 5,000 depositors falling prey to the lure of easy money.
