AMRITSAR: Immediately after US President Donald Trump’s executive orders banning entry of citizens of seven Muslim nations into America, the   ( ) has hired FP1, a conservative-leaning Washington-based marketing firm, which has clients like   and Ford, to develop and implement an effective strategy to improve the perception of Sikhism throughout North America.

 Co-founder and senior adviser of the NSC Rajwant Singh informed TOI on Tuesday that, “We will be partnering with FP1 to launch a major marketing campaign that will focus on increasing the Sikh American community’s presence in national and local news outlets and social media. The FP1’s relationship with conservative media and organizations will also help the NSC reach and educate Republicans and right-of-centre audiences.”
 
 The NSC is a mission launched by Sikhs in the US for better understanding of the Sikh community there and other countries and to project a positive image and profile of the Sikh community, especially post hate crimes against Sikhs. 
 
 Singh said that this was probably for the first time that the   community had undertaken a major proactive effort to reach out to Americans nationwide. 
 
 “Every step in our plan has been tested to have maximum effectiveness in shifting the perception and driving positive awareness on American Sikhs,” said NSC communications director Shawn Singh Ghuman. 
 
 Meanwhile,   ( ) representative Kavneet Singh said that he, along with the author of ‘Bullying of Sikh American Children’ Karanveer Singh, made presentations in three schools and addressed over 850 school students and over 70 teachers and gave a powerpoint presentation on turban tying. “The principals of the schools were given a set each of the “Sikhs and Scouts”, “History of Sikh Americans” and “Bullying of Sikh American Children”, brochures to create awareness about the Sikh heritage while providing long-term solutions to bullying,” he added.
