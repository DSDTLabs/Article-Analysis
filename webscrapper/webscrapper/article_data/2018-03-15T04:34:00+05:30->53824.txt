Vadodara: Cricket lovers may get to watch one-day international (ODIs) matches live from the stadium stands in the city soon. 

 Amitabh Chaudhary, BCCI acting secretary, said on Wednesday that the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) can approach the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with a request to host men’s international cricket matches. Chaudhary, who is in the city to watch the second India-Australia ODI at Reliance Stadium, seemed impressed with BCA’s cricketing facilities. 
 
 “Vadodara has one of the finest cricketing facilities in the country and all the cricket-related ingredients necessary for an international contest. The cricket support system here is good including that for umpires and referees,” Chaudhary told TOI after visiting the Reliance Stadium. “But the BCCI has a rule wherein only those cricket associations that own a stadium or have leased it can host an international cricket match. That’s an impediment for BCA,” he said.
 
 When asked if BCA will have to wait for years to host a men’s international match or IPL game, Chaudhary said, “BCA can make a request to the BCCI and the cricket board can consider it.” 
 
 BCA has recently bought a piece of land at Kotambi to build a cricket stadium but it will take several years to complete the project. The association had also tried to take Reliance Stadium on lease but that project too is hanging fire. 
 
 Snehal Parikh, BCA secretary (in-charge), said , “The idea behind organizing the three women’s ODIs was to bring international matches to the city for cricket-lovers and BCA members. Also, we wanted to show BCCI that BCA can host men’s ODI or T20. Now our hopes of bringing men’s international match to the city have increased”. 
 
 BCA had last hosted a men’s ODI in 2010. The land in Kotambi recently got non-agriculture (NA) permission following which BCA has initiated a process to hire an agency for project feasibility report.
