AHMEDABAD: With a slew of automobile companies setting up manufacturing facilities in  , the representatives of   (ACMA) have emphasized that the state needs aggressive investments from auto component manufacturers. To push manufacturers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to bring their facilities to Gujarat, the association is organizing ACMA Value Chain Summit at Mahatma Mandir next week, which will be inaugurated by chief minister  .

 “Gujarat has emerged as a key investment destination for major automotive manufacturers. The state has manufacturing facilities of the largest two-wheeler maker, the largest car manufacturer here, and the fastest growing two-wheeler manufacturer,” said Vinnie Mehta, the director general of ACMA. “If the government aims to achieve its ambitious target of manufacturing 10 lakh vehicle units annually by 2020, roughly 2.5 times the investment from automobile companies needs to be made by auto component manufacturers and OEMs.”
 
 Mehta pointed to the urgent requirement of social infrastructure around industrial belts. “When we look at investments, people will obviously be coming in,” he said. “Some of the obvious requirements would therefore be that of social infrastructure which includes easy access with a road network, transportation facilities, education and healthcare institutions, and housing facilities among others.”
 
 The summit is expected to feature 150 auto component manufacturers including tier-1 and tier-2 suppliers. “Apart from supporting OEMs, the summit is aimed at creating a platform for interaction between the government and industry representatives,” an ACMA official said.
