CHENNAI: Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is back at the helm in the   state assembly. He has been appointed as leader of the House, said a media release, issued by assembly secretary  , on Thursday. 

 Panneerselvam replaces school education minister K A   as leader of the House. It's a comeback of sorts for OPS to the post, after almost a year, when Sengottaiyan had replaced him.
 
 OPS was the leader of the House from 2011 when the AIADMK under J Jayalalithaa came back to power, defeating the DMK in the May 2011 assembly elections. He retained that post when the AIADMK successfully won a second term and Jayalalithaa became the chief minister once again, until her death on December 5, 2016.
 
 But after OPS rebelled against AIADMK leader V K   and formed a separate group, the AIADMK legislature party headed by chief minister   chose Sengottaiyan as the leader of the House.
 
 The two groups have since merged, with OPS now being part of the Palaniswami cabinet as deputy chief minister. The state assembly session is set to begin on January 8, which will mark governor Banwarilal Purohit's maiden address to the House.
 
 As per Tamil Nadu Assembly Rules, any minister can be appointed leader of the House. As leader of the House in the past, OPS had intervened several times during debates and heated arguments with the opposition.
