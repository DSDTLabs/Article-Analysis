Surat: Two class X students died in an accident after the scooter they were riding crashed into a road divider on Ugat Canal Road here on Saturday. One of the victims died on the spot while the other succumbed to injuries during treatment at a hospital.

 Dipak Yadav and Satish Chawda, both 16-year-olds, were going to school when their scooter crashed into the road divider railing. They were students of Navsarjan School. Chawda was riding the scooter while Yadav was pillion. They were without helmets, police said. Yadav died on the spot and Chawda breathed his last at the hospital. 
 
 “No vehicle hit the victim’s scooter and no vehicle came in front of them. It seems that due to some stone on the road the rider lost balance and the scooter rammed into the divider,” police said.
