CHANDIGARH: As the   (PU) bandh against   turned violent on Tuesday, 52 students, including three girls, were even booked for sedition before the charges were dropped. Sector 11 SHO   said the PU authorities had reported about "objectionable slogans" raised during the protest "but in the   footage, we found no such word". 

  The protesters faced tear gas and water cannon after the joint students action committee boycott turned ugly. Later, the protesters sought refuge inside the campus gurdwara but   persuaded the group of 38 to surrender. 
 
  It all started after students tried to barge into the VC's office. Police cane-charged and water-cannoned them. Instead of dispersing, the students dug in and pelted cops with stones, forcing the tear-gas attack. PU chief security officer Ashwani Koul said his team had scanned the protest footage again after the sedition charge came up. "The students have raised slogans against the HRD ministry, UGC, V-C, PM Modi, and PU authorities, but none of them spoke a word against the country," he said. "The registrar and I submitted a written clarification with police to put students off the sedition charge."
