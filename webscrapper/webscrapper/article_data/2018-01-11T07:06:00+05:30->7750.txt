GURGAON: A city-based environmentalist Colonel (retired)   sent a legal   to MCG joint commissioner Y S Gupta on Tuesday as the corporation has failed to take any action against illegal waste dumping at Ghata in the past six months.

 Colonel S S Oberoi has given MCG 30 days to clear the area near   or a case will be filed against MCG zone III office. “It is my constitutional duty to file prosecution against MCG office and the joint commissioner concerned if the area is not cleaned within 30 days. If illegal dumping is found in any area within the boundary of MCG after March 8, we will take the case to court,” said Colonel Oberoi.
 
 “We have forwarded the notice to the department concerned and action will be taken. As the Basai C&D waste treatment plant will now be in operation, the situation will improve,” said an official of MCG. Despite MCG penalising two people for dumping waste near Ghata Lake in September 2017 and green activists regularly lodging complaints, it is still taking place.
 
 Colonel Oberoi, who has sent a notice under Section 30 of Central Act 10 of 1994, alleging continued inaction, wrote, “Kindly take notice that you (joint commissioner of zone III of MCG) are personally liable to face criminal prosecution as per Paris Principles and you may not claim ordinary protections of government servants in such cases of human rights offences under Section 30 of Central Act 10 of 1994.”
