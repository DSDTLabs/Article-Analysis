BENGALURU: Investigation revealed that Amith and Shruthi met at a family get-together around eight months ago and the friendship blossomed on Facebook. Shruthi, a motorcycle buff, had posted many admiring comments on Amith's pictures of him riding bikes.

 Shruthi's husband   had purchased a   and Shruthi had taken it for a spin on Outer Ring Roads and the Nice Road, family members told STOI.
 
 But the friendship irritated family members, particularly Rajesh. “He called it a “virtual affair". Rajesh and Shruthi argued often about it and she would convince Ra jesh that it was just friendship and nothing else," family sources added. Things went from bad to worse when a family member told Rajesh that he had seen Shruthi and Amith sitting in a hotel. Rajesh fought with Shruthi about it that night, and told her that if she so wished, he was ready for a divorce.
 
 “This became a huge issue and Rajesh sent a word to Shruthi's parents, who live near Ramohalli in Ramanagara, to meet him. They met in October 2016 and Rajesh forced Shruthi to swear before parents that she would not meet Amith in future," sources added.
 
 Accordingly , Shruthi took a vow in front of parents that she would never meet Amith. “To make sure that the relationship ended, Rajesh deleted Amith from Shruthi's friends' list on Facebook," sources added.
 
 According to family sources, Rajesh would often check Shruthi's Facebook page when she'd log in. Shruthi never shared her FB password with Rajesh, though he repeatedly asked for it.
 
 “Everything was normal for some time. But Amith and Shruthi reportedly met even later. But they'd meet in some far-off places. We never thought it was an affair; just a strong friendship," family told investigating officers.
