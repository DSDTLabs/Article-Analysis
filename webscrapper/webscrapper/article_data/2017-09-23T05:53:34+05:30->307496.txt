AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court pulled up a lower court in Sabarkantha district for sending a juvenile delinquent to jail without paying any heed to his birth certificate. Justice G R Udhwani has ordered the teen to be immediately removed from jail and sent to a remand home for the juvenile. The HC will consider his bail plea under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. The juvenile was arrested and sent to jail in connection with a house-breaking case in a village near Talod town. When he was arrested along with co-accused, his lawyer brought it to the notice of the judicial magistrate and provided his school leaving certificate to prove that he was not an adult. However, the magistrate did not pay any attention to the certificate and follow the provisions of section 12 of the Juvenile Justice Act, and send him to judicial custody. The issue was never raised before the district court during the teen’s bail proceedings, and the court denied bail to him. When the teen approached the HC, his advocate Rajkumar Chaumal supplied documents to establish that the accused was a juvenile and he must not be kept in prison. Justice Udhwani termed the incident as “unfortunate” that the lower courts did not pay any attention to the facts and treated the boy as an accused and not a juvenile in conflict with law. The HC said that law does not contemplate police custody of a juvenile and unfortunately because of the careless approach, the juvenile in conflict with law was in police custody and in jail. “Continued custody of the juvenile is likely to defeat the very purpose of the act inasmuch as his possibility of coming into contact with the hardcore criminals in jail cannot be ruled out,” the HC said.
