PANAJI: Despite promises that its candidates would be announced well in advance, it appears that, in a repeat of 2012, the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) will leave it till the last minute to reveal its candidates. Unperturbed by the polling dates announced by the  , the Congress central election committee will meet only on January 9 to finalize the candidates for the February 4  .

 The crucial meeting will also bring finality to the contentious issue of a  , as   (GFP) and Nationalist   (NCP) expressed optimism that an alliance would be formed to dethrone the BJP in the state.
 
 “The central election committee will deliberate in three days and by January 9 or 10, the first list will be out. The meeting has to be fixed by the party vice-president,” GPCC president Luizinho Faleiro said.
 
 Each of the 40 constituency blocks had recommended names of probable candidates and sent the list to the district block committees last year, and the names were expected to be made public by November-December. GPCC received 113 names and these were sent to the pradesh election committee for vetting, from where the names were forwarded to the Congress screening committee headed by K Venugopal. 
 
 Political observers feel that the Congress was deliberately leaving it late to announce names to avoid dissent and revolt from disgruntled party workers who are not given a ticket. “If at all there is an alliance, it will be part of the meeting discussions,” Faleiro said.
 
 NCP has asked for five constituencies and hopes to field former PWD minister Churchill Alemao as its Benaulim candidate. NCP state president Jose Philip D’Souza is keen on contesting from Vasco. 
 
 GFP on its part is keen to contest seven constituencies, including Porvorim, Siolim, Saligao, Fatorda and Navelim among others.
