Trichy: Residents of Ponmalai and E Pudur picketed corporation offices in their respective wards on Wednesday alleging erratic supply of drinking water for over a month now. The corporation officials carried out talks with the agitating residents who later suspended their protest following an assurance that water would be supplied in tanker lorries. 

 Many of the wards in Ponmalai zone have been facing acute shortage of drinking water over the past few weeks. Places like Ponmalaipatti have been devoid of water for the past many days. Acute shortage of water had forced the city corporation to restrict daily supply of drinking water to alternate days. From Monday, water was being supplied on alternate days to 60 wards of the city corporation. One half of the city would be supplied water on one day and next half on the other. This way, civic body intends to stretch the supply with the depleting drinking water for a few more weeks . 
 
 “The situation has worsened after the corporation announced supply of water on alternative days,” said a resident of ward 36 C Sekar. While less than 50 per cent of the ward has been getting water over the past one month, now the supply has almost been stopped by the city corporation,” he said. 
 
 Claiming that Ponmalai was situated upstream, the corporation admitted difficulties in pumping water into few of the tanks in the zone leading to the shortage. “We have now installed a separate valve to streamline supply of water in these areas. Besides, water supply through tanker lorry will also be made to these areas,” said an official. Similar protests were held over drinking water shortage by residents in airport, Rock Fort and E Pudur areas.
