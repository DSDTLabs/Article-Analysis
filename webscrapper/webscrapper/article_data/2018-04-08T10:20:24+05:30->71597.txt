KANNUR: The books fair, organized by the   here, reflects some changing trends in book reading. 

 “While the big names have their predictable buyers, who are after established writers, a new breed of readers are coming up along with new publishers. That is a pleasant scenario,” said Sumesh VP, who runs Kozhikode-based publishing house Insight Publica, with the support of his wife  .
 
 “If you package a good book in an attractive manner and showcase it properly, people will buy it. If the author is genuine, the reader will accept it even if he or she is not a celebrity,” said Sumesh, who introduced many young writers and translated many works.
 
 In the changing times, the book production and design should also change to cater to the tastes of the readers and the recent trends show the people are making a comeback to reading, he said.
 
 Agreeing that the reading habit is making a comeback, O Ashok Kumar, managing director of   in Kannur, said the efforts to promote reading among schoolchildren has started showing its results.
 
 “Reading is not limited to any particular subject or author, and the influence of social media has also helped improve the habit of readers,” he said.
 
 After a long gap of over a decade, the serious book reading habit which had thrived in the nineties, thanks to the efforts of people like Shalvy of Mulberry Publications, is making a comeback, and this is a welcome change, he said.
 
 Though there are enough readers for the classical works of senior writers, a new breed of readership is also emerging. Thanks to the advent of social media and the publishers can cater to them, said Muneer C V, who is working with Olive Books.
 
 This change in sensibility has emerged over the last few years and the book festivals in different parts of the state have played a major role in this, said writer and editor V H Nishad.
