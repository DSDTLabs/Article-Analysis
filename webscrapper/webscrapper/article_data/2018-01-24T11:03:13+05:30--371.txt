BHOPAL: Halfway through his   - having covered 1,900km on foot -   veteran and former chief minister   doesn't mind admitting he's a bit tired. But the 70-year-old is confident that as soon as his spiritual walk is over, he will play a vital role for Congress in the upcoming assembly elections. 

 Digvijaya repeatedly asserts that his Narmada Parikrama is a "purely personal and spiritual exercise". However, the padyatra along the holy river has brought him up close with home truths of Madhya Pradesh and he told TOI that he will make "revelations" that could have political repercussions. As senior Congress leader, he will unite all factions of the party ahead of the polls, he said.
