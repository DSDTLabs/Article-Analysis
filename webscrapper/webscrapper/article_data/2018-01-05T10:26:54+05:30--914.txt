CHANDIGARH: Whether or not rebel candidate Asha Jaswal will get any support to continue as mayor will be clear on Friday when the Supreme Court hears the matter of voting rights for the nominated municipal councillors of this city.

 After the Punjab and Haryana high court had annulled these rights last August, the UT Administration had challenged the decision in the apex court and called for a stay. Only 26 elected councillors and the local MP have voting rights in the MC house. Even though the   ( ) has a thumping majority with 21 votes, including that of MP and ex-officio member  , a split into two major groups during the filing of nomination papers for mayor has given it worries.
 
 Sitting mayor Asha Jaswal, who has come into the contest as independent candidate, belongs to the faction of city BJP city president Sanjay Tandon, which claims the support of more than 10 councillors. The Supreme Court’s Friday’s hearing will be crucial in the current scenario. If the nine nominated councillors get the voting rights, the voter count will jump from 26 to 36 and boost the fortunes of Tandon and Jaswal.
 
 Party insiders say that most of the nominated councillors owe their nomination to the Sanjay Tandon group. “The administrator nominated them officially but their names were recommended by Tandon and belong to active BJP members of the past,” a source said. “If the apex court stays the high court decision of cancelling the voting rights of the nominated councillors, Jaswal and her supporters will force the party high command to reconsider fielding Davesh Moudgil for the top post. Tandon loyalist Jaswal has strong hopes from the nominated members, and if they come into play, it’ll be a tough fight,” said a senior leader of the BJP.
