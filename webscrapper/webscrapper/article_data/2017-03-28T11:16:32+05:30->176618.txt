I embrace it. It fills my heart and leaves no place for hate. I just want to surrender myself to good work, good people who acknowledge my intentions genuinely. And yes am feeling a little lost and nervous too. Don't know what the future holds for me. But thank God my son Mohan is sleeping next to me. As I look at his innocent face, i feel lucky to have such a reason to smile. It reassures me that no matter what tomorrow will be beautiful. New.... Yet beautiful.
