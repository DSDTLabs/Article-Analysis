KOCHI: The land allegedly involved in the controversial land deal involving   cannot be considered as public land and the offence of breach of trust is not attracted, a counsel representing Cardinal   has contended before the high court. 

 The argument by the cardinal's counsel came during the admission hearing on a petition filed by   of   questioning non-registration of FIR by   central police even after filing a complaint.
 
 During the hearing, the cardinal's counsel submitted that the land regarding which allegations have been raised does not belong to the government but to the diocese. Even if there is loss as alleged, there is no scope for a third party to interfere. Therefore, the alleged offence of criminal breach of trust is not involved, the counsel argued.
 
 It was stated in the petition filed by Shine Varghese that a complaint was filed before Ernakulam central police on February 15 for registering an FIR but no receipt was issued by stating that there is instruction from higher officials not to issue any receipts for complaints against the cardinal and others.
 
 The petitioner has also alleged that the Kochi city police commissioner had revealed to media that no criminal case can be taken against the cardinal as all the transactions were carried out in his name. A court directive to police to register an FIR and launch a probe is sought by the petitioner.
