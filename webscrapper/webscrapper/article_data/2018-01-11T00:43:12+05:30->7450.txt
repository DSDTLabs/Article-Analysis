MUMBAI: Four months after applying for revaluation, a final- year BA   student from Mumbai University’s Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) got her results on Wednesday. 

 However, it was too late for Meenakshi  , who has lost a year and cannot pursue her BEd this year. 
 Meenakshi is one of the several victims of Mumbai University’s assessment mess last year. After scoring 17 marks and failing in Advanced Economics  , she had sought a photocopy and revaluation of her answersheet on August 31. 
 
 To her astonishment, the photocopy she received from the university only had her supplement, where she has scored two marks. While she was not the only student to be assessed only for the answers written in the supplement, Patil's revaluation results were released on Wednesday, four months after she applied for it. “She had cleared her BEd entrance exam, but couldn’t apply for the course as she was declared failed in her BA final year. 
 
 We are hoping the failed tag does not remain with her forever and she gets a revised marksheet soon,” said her father, Arvind Patil. Meenakshi’s fresh score showed she had scored 33 marks and cleared the paper. The Patils said activists from Yuva Sena, a students’ organisation led by Aaditya Thackeray, had pursued the matter with the examination section.
