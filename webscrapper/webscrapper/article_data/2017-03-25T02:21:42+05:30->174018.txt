NEW DELHI:   Ajay Maken on Friday launched the party’s campaign for the   through online video and Q&A sessions with the public. In the video, Maken talked about the road map that   has prepared in consultation with their senior functionaries to make the three municipal corporations “self-reliant”. 

 Maken alleged that BJP had failed to streamline its system on the corporation level, forcing sanitation workers to go on strike five times in the last two years. “Delhi has been filled with garbage,” he added.
 
 Maken talked in detail about the solutions his party had for the city if voted to power. “Our first step will be to ensure that areas like resettlement colonies, slum clusters and unauthorised colonies are developed. We will keep aside Rs 2,000 crore just for carrying out development of these areas, as there is no infrastructure in place. We aim to clear the arrears of sanitation workers and all other employees of the corporations. The party will also regularise contractual employees,” Maken said. 
 
 He pointed out that making the three corporations self-reliant was need of the hour and “important reforms” needed to be introduced. “Corporations have large plots of vacant land, but these are not being utilised. These can be rented out to boost revenue. NDMC is doing it. So, why can’t these three corporations?”
