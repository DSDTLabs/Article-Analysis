NEW DELHI: After a   in the   collections in 2016-17, the Delhi government is hoping to end the current fiscal with a growth of 19.3%. The shift is likely due to the shift to the goods and services tax regime last July, said government sources. 

 Total revenue receipts, including non-tax revenue and grants from the Centre, were Rs 34,345.74 crore in 2016-17 against Rs 34,998.70 crore in 2015-16. The target for 2017-18, as per budget estimates, is set at Rs 42,216 crore.
 
 While Economic Survey of Delhi does not give any reason for the dismal growth for 2016-17, officials point out that multiple factors, including the slump in the property market and demonetisation, contributed to the slowdown. Besides, the VAT department gave out refunds and the gradual reduction in central sales tax component also played a part. 
 
 The value added tax collections were Rs 20,245.82 crore in 2015-16 and rose marginally to Rs 21,144.24 crore in 2016-17. The target in 2017-18 is Rs 26,500 crore. With the shifit to GST and better compliance, the VAT department is hopeful of making the cut this time. 
 
 The average growth of tax   is around 15% in Delhi, hence the 3.3% growth of 2016-17 was abysmally low. The break-up of tax collection shows that in 2016-17, tax collection from stamps and registration, including land revenue, was Rs 3,145.94 crore. This was in fact lower than the 2015-16 collection of Rs 3,433.96 crore. For 2017-18, the government set a target of Rs 4,035 crore.
 
 The excise duty collection, another key component, was Rs 4,237.69 crore in 2015-16. This rose marginally to Rs 4,251.40 crore in 2016-17. In 2017-18, the target is Rs 52,00 crore. 
 
 Taxes on vehicles rose from Rs 1,607.01 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 1,808.78 crores in 2016-17. The target for 2017-18 is Rs 2,000 crore.
