LUCKNOW: An inspector was suspended for chewing tobacco and not sweeping the floor despite the oath of   and for not wearing proper uniform in   police station on Saturday.

 Action was taken after visuals went viral of   of Madiaon, Nagesh Mishra reading the cleanliness pledge with tobacco in his mouth and wearing slippers at the function instead of shoes. Senior officials said when he was asked to take the oath he had refused, saying, “I did not become an inspector to wipe floors.”
