GHAZIABAD: A man allegedly stabbed his 22-year-old niece inside   for eloping with a youth from a different community. The victim did not sustain any major injury as a woman constable overpowered the accused before he could attack again. A case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC has been slapped against the man who has been arrested.

 According to the police, the victim was in a relationship with a youth from a different community and they both lived in Loni’s Saraswati Vihar area. “The two eloped on February 14. The woman’s family members lodged an FIR against the youth under Section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) of IPC the next day,” said Om Prakash Choudhary, SHO, Loni police station. 
 
 “We found the couple from   in Loni on Wednesday. The youth was arrested and the woman was sent to her family,” he said.
 
 On Thursday morning, the woman came to Loni police station with her aunt to record her statement. “While her statement was being recorded in front of a woman constable, Santosh, her uncle Kailash, who came to the police station, requested that he wanted to speak to her. We granted him permission,” said Choudhary. “However, within seconds, Kailash took out a knife and stabbed his niece. Before he could attack her again, Santosh overpowered him and he was taken into custody.” The victim was admitted to the hospital from where she was discharged.
 
 SP (city) Salmantaj Patil called it a case of attempted honour killing as Kailash was enraged with his niece for tarnishing the image of their family.
 
 “Kailash admitted that he wanted to kill his niece as she had brought shame to the family. Now we will proceed to record her statement under Section 164 of CrPC in court,” he said.
