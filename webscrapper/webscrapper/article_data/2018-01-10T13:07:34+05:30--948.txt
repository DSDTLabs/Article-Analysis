MUNGER: Chief minister   on Tuesday directed the education department officials to complete the groundwork and make the new   functional at the earliest.

 While reviewing the progress in the ongoing flagship projects of the Centre and the state in all six districts of Munger division at the district headquarters, the CM directed principal secretary (education) R K Mahajan to make arrangements for taking over one building of R D & D J College at Munger for administrative work of the new university. 
 
 Nitish also directed secretary of state environment and forest department to take steps for creating a big reservoir of hot water running from the hills at Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary, so that it could be used by people of the area for domestic as well as irrigation purposes.
 
 Expressing concern over large number of applications filed under Public Grievance Redressal Act, the CM said it was indication enough that people were not getting their works done at the lower level of governance. Accordingly, he directed the DMs of Munger, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Khagaria and Begusarai to monitor the functioning at micro level. 
 
 The CM also expressed concern over the lack of proper attention to the plan of starting medical and engineering colleges at the district headquarters. Incidentally, the plan to open an engineering college at Munger has been languishing for the last ten years due to unavailability of suitable land. A proposal for medical college in Begusarai district is also hanging in the balance for similar reasons.
 
 Chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, DGP Pramod Kumar Thakur and secretaries of different government departments, besides DMs and SPs of all the six districts were present at the review meeting.
 
 Water resources minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh, rural works minister  , labour resources minister Vijay Kumar Sinha besides MLAs and MLCs of the area attended the meeting.
