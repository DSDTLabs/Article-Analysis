BHOPAL: Farzana, Fatima, Sunita and Suman - all four women have one thing in common. All of them are struggling to fill up a 4-page application form in English that could get them a house to live in. 

 Cooking meals inside a shanty in   of the state, Farzana asked her husband to look for a translator, who could help her fill up form under the scheme,   (HFO) by 2022, launched by the   in English language. All those eligible for scheme come from poor socio-economic background. "Even government servants, who have brought forms have not been of much help," Farzana, a woman, who studied up to primary level, explained her problem to her husband, a labourer. 
 
 Mother of two kids, she has been identified as one of beneficiaries for the HFO. The very idea of getting a house has elated her. But, for that she will have to cross a major hurdle of English first.
 
 "I can't even read Hindi properly and the government wants me to fill up the form in English. I don't know how to solve this problem," she told TOI. Farzana's is not alone to face this problem. They are thousands like her other across the state. The local administration has made forms available at anganwadi centres, where large number of women reach every day and protest against the language.
 
 "When even local officers find it difficult to understand various points, I doubt whether they would be able to fill up the form correctly. This may lead to our disqualification," said Sunita.
 
 Manju, an anganwadi worker, said, "We are trying to solve their problem, but in vain. English, you know, is a big issue in rural areas. I can fill up details like name, father's name and age. I am leaving blank other columns."
