BHOPAL: A policeman who was duped of Rs 80,000 had to file an online complaint on CM Helpline after running in circles for 15 days trying to register a FIR.

 The complainant, Rambharose Gurjar, is an assistant sub inspector posted at Bajaria police station. On January 20, on his way home, he stopped to withdraw cash at an   in  . The transaction failed after repeated attempts. Seeing him struggle, a youth who was inside the booth offered help. He asked for his ATM pin and withdrew Rs 4,000 for Gurjar.
 
 
 The youth replaced Gurjar’s ATM card with a fake card and returned it to him. When the 59-year-old cop reached home, he received bank alerts of cash withdrawal on his cell phone.
 
 The youth withdrew Rs 36,000 cash from a   ATM — in four transactions three of Rs 10,000 each and one of Rs 6,000. He also transferred Rs 39,500 to a bank account in Tamil Nadu and bought a wrist watch worth Rs 4,400 using Gurjar’s account.
 
 The cop tried to block his card only to find that it has been replaced with a fake. His troubles did not end here, as the cop went to Ashoka Garden police station to register a complaint. The Ashoka Garden police told him to take his complaint to the cyber cell. The next day Gurjar reached the cyber cell only to be sent back to the Ashoka Garden police station. He also submitted the details of all the transactions but the cops did not file a complaint and gave excuses. On receiving no response for 15 days, the cop filed a complaint with the CM Helpline, after which a case was registered at Ashoka Garden police station on Thursday — in a matter of three days.
 
 Police had no satisfactory answer for not filing the case.
 
 Investigation officer ASI Manoj Yadav said that the   where the money was transferred is being sought.   footage of the ATM booth and the area nearby will also be screened. Further investigation is on.
