JAIPUR: The   due to the construction of an   in Jhotwara will be relocated to  

 For construction of proposed elevated road between Panchayat Bhawan at Kalwar Road and Ambabari , JDA has identified nearly 550 structures which will be demolished. JDA on Thursday started physical verification house owners who will be affected. 
 
 According to officials, 30 % affected owners have already constructed their houses on government land. “We have identified 25 bigahs of land at Niwaru road near Express flyover. The land belongs to district administration which has approved to transfer it to JDA. Final decision will be taken in next meeting,” said a JDA official. 
 
 Jaipur development commissioner Vaibhav Galeriya also met local MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi to decide on compensation and relocation of the affected house owners to expedite the construction work. 
 
 Process to finalise the compensation for affected house owners was stalled for long. After receiving a loan approval from National Capital and Regional Planning Board (NCRPB), JDA resumed the process on Thursday. 
 
 The proposed elevated road will have a length of 2.4 kms and width of 11.50 metres at the estimated cost of Rs 166 crore, a JDA official said.
 
 “As per recent survey, JDA will require 52,349 square metres of land near the flyover. Curently, JDA only has 28,700 square metres of land,” another JDA official added.
 
 As the smaller flyover is creating frequent bottlenecks and no land available on either side, there is no option left to broaden the flyover except an elevated road. The existing elevated road at Jhotwara railway over bridge will be opened for one-way traffic, once the road is constructed. 
 
 Currently, there is two-way traffic on the stretch. Traffic on the flyover has increased after new colonies came up in nearby areas.
