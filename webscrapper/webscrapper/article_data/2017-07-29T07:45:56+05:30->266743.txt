CHANDIGARH: Haryana Congress Legislature Party leader  , on Friday, asked the state government to amend its ‘diluted and derailed’ version of the Central   Regulation Act (RERA). Alleging that it was just an eyewash, she said the Haryana RERA had been scripted to provide errant developers with a ready escape route and the rules were riddled with loopholes.

 The former excise and taxation minister said home buyers were angry over some anti-people provisions contained in Haryana RERA. “These include one that exempts such projects from the ambit of the law as have been granted occupation certificate (OC). This provides developers with an escape route,” said the Tosham MLA Choudhry.
 
 Explaining the dilution, she said, under the Central RERA, developers who obtained   (CC) for their projects before May 1, 2017, would be out of its ambit, but in Haryana, it was possible with just an OC, which could be had much earlier and with lot more ease than a CC. “The rules have been deliberately diluted by the town and country planning (TCP) department to suit the builders and not buyers,” Choudhry alleged.
 
 She said neither suggestions like not to accept an OC as reason for exemption from RERA made by home buyers were factored in nor a logical explanation was given for not accepting them.“It is high time the state government made suitable amendments in   to suit the buyers before notifying the Act,” Choudhry said.
