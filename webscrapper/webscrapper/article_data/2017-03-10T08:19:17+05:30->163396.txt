  "When Siddarth's teachers informed us about his performance, we had asked him to do his best. On Tuesday, he was reading on the first floor when we left for work. We returned in the evening to find the door of the reading room locked from inside. We broke open the door to find him hanging from the ceiling fan," parents told police.
