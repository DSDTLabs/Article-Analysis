Vadodara: The swanky central bus depot of Vadodara, which is touted to be the country’s first such bus port, will act as a model for the rest of the country. Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday urged transport ministers of other states to develop similar bus ports in their states.

  In fact, the reason for selecting Vadodara for the 38th meeting of the Transport Development Council, was its bus port, Gadkari said, adding that such projects don’t require huge budget.
 
 “Our bus depots presently are full of filth and garbage strewn everywhere. Why can’t poor go to washrooms like those in three star or five star facilities,” he said, while stressing for need of eco-friendly and cost-effective public transport systems.
 
 Gadkari also offered central help to build such bus ports. “We will bear the cost of developing plans. We can have alternate models as well. Those that can work for small towns and those that can work for bigger places,” he said.
