Jennifer Winget, who has garnered appreciation from the viewers for her portrayal of Maya in TV show  , is all set to surprise them yet again with her return in an all new avatar. 

 This time the stunning actress will go bald on the show. Jennifer hasn't chopped off her luscious locks, but will be seen sporting a wig for the same. The coming episodes will show her dressed in white (suggesting she'd be a widow), surrounded by children and saints. It is then that she will be seen getting her 'mundan' done. 
 
  
  
 This whole change in look will be a part of the third leap that the show is all set to take, where Maya will take revenge against  . 
 
 According to reports, the leap episode will show how Maya was saved by the saints and brought to an ashram. Surrounded by children, Maya recalls the day she lost her own child and begins to hold Arjun responsible for his attempt to kill her. It will lead her to shave off her head and avenge her death. 
 
 It seems after the leap Maya will turn a bigger threat to Arjun and Saanjh's life, and will leave no stone unturned to destroy their life.
