NOIDA: A 25-year-old teacher on Tuesday alleged that she was raped by her former landlord for two years when she lived in Sector 167. The woman, a mother of two children, now lives with her husband in Mangrauli village.

 
 The woman said that in 2008 she had shifted to the accused   alias Chaman’s house to stay as a tenant. She lived there for a year before moving out. During her stay she had befriended Chaman’s wife.
