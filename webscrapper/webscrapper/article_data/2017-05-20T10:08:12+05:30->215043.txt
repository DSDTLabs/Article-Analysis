PANAJI: Crime branch of Goa police on Friday arrested three inmates of Sada jail in connection with the murder of undertrial   earlier this year. Crime branch arrested Rahul Kumar,   and   Shaikh. 

 SP (crime branch) Priyanka Kashyap confirmed the arrest of the accused. “Accused are suspected to be involved in the crime as they were present at the scene of crime,” she told TOI. We will interrogate the accused to find out the motive behind the murder, she said. 
 
 Crime branch sleuths on Friday brought the accused to crime branch from Sada jail after obtaining a warrant for custody of the trio. Later in the evening they were produced before the JMFC, Vasco, and have been remanded to five-day police custody.
 
 Kashyap said that they are also trying to retrieve CCTV camera footage of the rioting in Sada jail from a hard disk that was broken during the ruckus.
 
 Karbotkar was killed on January 24, after a fight broke out between two groups of jail inmates in which some inmates were injured. The case was transferred to the crime branch in February.
 
 TOI was the first to report that the crime branch had found clues in Karbotkar’s death in Sada sub-jail after recording the statements of inmates and guards. 
 
 Six months before his murder, Karbotkar was charged with killing history-sheeter,  , at central jail, Colvale, where both were lodged. After the incident, he was shifted to Sada. 
 
 PI Vishwesh Karpe is investigating the case.
