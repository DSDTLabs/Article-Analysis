Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) removing a statue of former deputy prime minister late Jagjivan Ram from the Airport Circle has raked up a controversy. The statue that was still covered was placed inside the circle sometime before Sunday morning, but was later removed stating that it was placed without permission.

 What fuelled the row was the fact that the Babu Jagjivanram Akhil Bharatiya Samta Andolan (BJABSA) on Monday claimed that the demand for the statue was cleared by the general board of the civic body. The organisation was even issued a letter in this regard by the general board. The opposition Congress and BJABSA raised the issue on Monday with the VMC and sprinkled water on the statue to ‘purify it’.
 
 The VMC clarified on Monday evening that the statue should have been placed after signing an agreement with the traffic and public relations departments of the VMC. Also, demarcation of the space where it was to be placed should have been done. But no steps were taken in this direction. 
 
 It added that as per the Supreme Court order of 2013, putting such statues on traffic circles and roads was prohibited.
