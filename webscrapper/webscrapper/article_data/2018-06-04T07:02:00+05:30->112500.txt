GHAZIABAD: At least 10 people have been booked for allegedly hurling stones and attacking a police team during a raid on illegal   sale on the Delhi-UP border in   on Saturday. A sub-inspector sustained head injuries in the attack. He was discharged from hospital later on Sunday.

 
 
 The attack took place around 8 pm on Saturday in   of Seemapuri. A team of more than a dozen  , including four sub-inspectors, had reached the four-feet wide lane that separates Delhi and UP after receiving information about consumption of alcohol in public places.
 
 Police said houses located on either sides of the road sell branded alcohol, mostly those marked for sale in   only, at cheap prices. “People consume alcohol by standing on the UP side of the border. We raided a house and arrested a person named Abdul who was selling alcohol illegally. We seized five cartons of branded liquor from his house. When we were returning with him, people climbed on rooftops and began hurling stones at us. A woman in crowd hurled a brick at me that hit on the back of my head,” said sub-inspector Dinesh Pal Singh.
 
 Singh was rushed to a private hospital in Sahibabad where he was treated overnight. “A few other cops sustained minor bruises. We’re trying to ascertain the leaders of racket,” SP (city) Akash Tomar said.
