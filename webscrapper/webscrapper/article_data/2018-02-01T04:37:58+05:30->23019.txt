MUMBAI: Nothing breaks barriers like art does. It is with this premise on mind that two city-based artists—Salva   and Achyut Palav—are putting up a show titled ‘Ishwar Allah Tero Naam’ at   from February 6 to 12. Featuring around 40 paintings, the exhibition celebrates our differences and promotes peace and harmony.

 Allah or Ishwar is the common thread which runs in the paintings on exhibit. “Every painting has a story behind it. My calligraphic paintings are inspired by Picasso’s cubism, and convey the humane and compassionate character of Allah or the creator,” said Rasool who has known   for three decades and collaborated for this exhibition over a year ago. She added that, despite so much diversity, India’s cherished pluralism deserves to be kept intact.
 
 Palav has blended Devnagri and Urdu scripts to paint so as to showcase harmony between the languages. “Ishwar and Allah are the two names of the same forces which sustain us. As an artist it is my duty to uphold the commonalities among communities. The idea behind using Devnagri and Urdu scripts for the calligraphy is to send a message that our languages are beautiful and we must celebrate and respect them,” said Palav who was four years senior to Rasool at J J School of Art.
 
 One of Pallav’s paintings is called ‘ekta’ or unity. He has used his brush to depict ekta in Devnagri as well as its Urdu translation ittihad. “When you look at it dispassionately, both ekta and ittihad in a single frame denote the message of unity. Unity is our strength and we must preserve it,” he said.
