 Members of   have protested the move. “The government should not do away with the booklet since a lot of students come to study in Mumbai from rural parts of the state and might not have easy access to getting the details printed,” said  , member, Yuva Sena. 
 
 A delegation submitted a request to the deputy director’s office on Friday. 
 
 Meanwhile, the admission process in the city hasn’t taken off yet. While in other cities like Pune, junior college registration is already under way, Mumbai will host its first meeting only on March 26.
