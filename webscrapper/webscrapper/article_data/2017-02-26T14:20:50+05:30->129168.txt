Film director   has recently stirred the hornet's nest with a barrage a   against Tamilians and the ongoing protest against the traditional bull-taming sport. This has offended not only the protestors of  , but the entire state of  . 

 
 
 Protesting against barbarism of #jaijallikattu is very much in tune with worshipping tribalish/feudal culture of Jayalalitha and Sasikala
 
 Each of the #jaijallikattu supporters should be made to run with 100's of Bulls chasing and then I want to hear him talk about his feelings
 
 If Tamil #jaijallikattu culture is about brutalising poor animals then Al Qaeda's culture of beheading innocent people also is right
 
 None of the #jaijallikattu protestors know neither the meaning nor spelling of culture ..They are just human shaped vultures wanting blood
 
 #jaijallikattu is a true throwback to the tremendously ugly diasporic thinkinginglynonthinking of Tamilian culturastic non culture
 
 If poor innocent animals also had voting power and could buy tickets no celebrity would have dared to support #jaijallikattu
 
 If Supreme Court bends down to mindless mobs and personal profit oriented celebrities it's proof there's no constitution in india
 
  shud demand UN to rename TN as Jallikattu..Register it as mediveal state in need of psychiatric treatment of wanting to torture
 
 Celebrities are shit scared of dictatorial TN politicians..Their cowardly heroism comes out only in supporting torture of innocent animals
