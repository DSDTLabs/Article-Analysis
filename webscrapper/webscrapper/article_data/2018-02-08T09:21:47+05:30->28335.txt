LUDHIANA: Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission ( ) is going to organise a public hearing in Ludhiana on Thursday. The agenda of the meeting is to gather public opinion about the rules, regulations and tariff plans of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( ) from stakeholders including industrial and residential consumers. However, in the wake of the recent delay in the implementation of ₹5 per unit rate of electricity, this meeting is expected to be stormy. 

 President of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU)   said, “Our association will meet the PSERC delegation and take up the issue of implementation of the rate of ₹5 per unit of power, about which there is still no clarity. Apart from this, there are other serious issues like delay in announcement of tariffs by PSERC and deficiency in services of PSPCL,”   said adding the issue of frequent power cuts, especially in industrial areas, will also be taken up. 
 
 President of Fastener Manufacturer Association of India Narinder   said, “It is a good initiative that PSERC has decided to organise public hearing in Ludhiana. The issue of retrospective charges is a very serious issue, which needs to be resolved, and our association will take up this issue with PSERC and demand for its removal.” 
 
 Speaking to TOI, president of Ludhiana Business Forums Dinesh   said, “The issue of hike in tariffs of commercial connections is hitting the industries and commercial establishments. PSPCL needs to take a call on providing relief to such consumers as well by reducing tariffs.”
