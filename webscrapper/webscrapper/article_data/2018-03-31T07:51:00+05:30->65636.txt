CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh municipal corporation has started installing   in front of category 4 houses in Manimajra. The demand by the residents had been approved by the civic body in a meeting last month. 

 The issue was raised by the residents welfare association in a meeting in February. The meeting was chaired by MC chief engineer   and was attended by a number of the officials from various civic body departments. The residents welfare , in the meeting, had demanded a walking track near the category 4 houses of the area. Following this, the horticulture department was instructed to construct it at the earliest.
 
 It was decided in the meeting that after one month, a review will be done on the implementation of the decision made based on the issues discussed in the meeting and its status.
 
 During a visit to the area, it was found that the staff have started installing the paver blocks near the category 4 houses, starting from house number 5235 to 5246. The residents said, the pavements in front of their houses were left out by the contractor, when they were constructing other pavements. Due to this, the residents demanded a walking track as soon as possible for the convenience of public.
 
 The point was taken up by the resident welfare association president   and the work was started by the department. This pending work has been restarted with inter-locking tiles in the area.
 
 Residents said once the installation of these paver blocks is done, it is convenient for the public to use it as a walking path as well as a parking area.
