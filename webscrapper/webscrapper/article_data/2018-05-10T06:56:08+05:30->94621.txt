PUNE: The Wanowrie police on Tuesday night arrested two of the five office-bearers of a private software company here for manipulating answer sheets of   Group II candidates. 

 Shirish Avdhut (32) and   (32) will be in police custody till May 14. The police had booked the office-bearers on a complaint lodged by an SRPF official on May 1.
 
 Wanowrie police sub-inspector Ravindra Bagul said, “We transferred the custody of Avdhut and Salunkhe, who were earlier arrested by the Nanded police, after obtaining production warrants from a magisterial court here. We are interrogating them to find out their roles in the crime. We have also launched a hunt for the three office-bearers on the run.” 
 
 The SRPF authorities had given contract to the same Pune-based company, which was later found involved in the Nanded recruitment scam to prepare the answer sheets of the candidates. The answer sheets were supposed to be accessed automatically with the help of computers.
 
 The SRPF Group II had conducted physical and written examinations for the posts of police constables on its Ramtekdi campus in Hadapsar on April 21 and 22. The written examinations and its results were cancelled because of the scam. All candidates will be again called for the written examinations and its schedule will be issued.
 
 The police said the suspects had manipulated the written examination marks. The physical tests of the candidates will not be conducted again. 
 
 The Nanded police had unearthed the racket of written answer sheet manipulation. Some office-bearers of the company had issued fake answer sheets to the candidates and enhanced their marks against financial gains. 
 
 Preliminary investigation by the Nanded police revealed that around 33 candidates from Pune were allotted good marks by the company office-bearers.
