NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the Union Budget 2018 for the fiscal year 2018-19 on Thursday in the Parliament. 

  The finance minister announced that there will be no changes in the personal   slabs. However, to woo the middle class, a standard deduction of Rs 40,000 was introduced in lieu of transport and medical reimbursements for salaried employees. 
 
 "In order to provide relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of Rs 40,000/- in lieu of the present exemption in respect of transport allowance and reimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses," Arun Jaitley said while presenting the Budget 2018-19 in Parliament today.
 
 The salaried and individual class had high hopes for higher income tax exception limit to be given in this Budget.
 
 The people were anticipating that the income-tax slab rates for year 2018-19, which is to be announced on February 1 during the Budget Session of Parliament, will up the exemption by at least Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh from the current Rs 2.5 lakh limit. 
 
 In the previous Budget Session (Union Budget 2017), Jaitley reduced the tax rate for individual assesses with income between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh to 5 per cent from the FY 2014-15 rate of 10 per cent. 
 
 The FY 2014-15 rebate under Section 87A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, was also reduced to Rs 2,500 from Rs 5,000 for those earning between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3.5 lakh. 
 
 Hence, as a combined effect, the tax burden on those earning up to Rs 3 lakh became nil, and for those in the Rs 3 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh bracket became Rs 2,500 during FY 2016-17. 
 
 This is going to be the last full-fledged budget to be presented by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, and the first one post the roll out of the GST.
 
 The public is expecting a "Please All" budget from finance minister this year.
