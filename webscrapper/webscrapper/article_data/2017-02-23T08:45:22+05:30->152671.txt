DHUBULIA: A   was kicked in her belly, leading to the death of her  , when she protested against kirtan being performed on a loudspeaker on Tuesday, a night before   began. The incident took place at Tantla in the Dhubulia police station area of Nadia. 

 "A fight broke out over playing of loudspeakers. As the accused beat up our neighbour, Shambhu Das, my brother went to rescue him but he was also attacked. When my wife tried to stop the accused, they kicked her in front of BJP panchayat pradhan of Sadhanpara 2, Palash Kumar Biswas," said victim Mayarani Santra's husband Sanjay, who works as a driver in Kolkata. 
 
 Biswas was arrested on Wednesday night after a complaint was lodged against five people. He, however, said, "I'm not involved in the incident. It is a conspiracy by Trinamool." Brushing away the claim, Trinamool's Ujjal Biswas said, "There is no conspiracy. Their men beat up a pregnant woman." 
 
 Mahadeb Sarkar, general secretary of BJP in Nadia, said, "They are just trying to harass our panchayat pradhan but we will always be by his side."
