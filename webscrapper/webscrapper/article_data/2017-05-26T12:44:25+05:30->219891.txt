ELURU: In a  , bodies of four members of a family, who apparently committed suicide a week ago, were found in their Dwaraka Nagar   on Thursday. 

 A close family member collapsed upon seeing the putrefied bodies after police broke open the main door.
 
 The deceased were identified as   (52), her daughter Devarkonda Santhoshi Rupa (37) and grandchildren D Sai Siddhartha (9) and D Sairam (5). It was Rupa's father-in-law Kotavarapu Venkataramana Rao who suspected foul-play as there was bad odour at the house. He soon informed the police who reached the spot and broke open the door only to find the four decomposed bodies rotting away in the bedroom. Rao collapsed at the sight of the bodies.
 
 DSP Gogu Venkateswarao told TOI that the four might have committed suicide a week ago by consuming pesticide-laced softdrink. Narrating the sequence of events, the DSP said Rupa's husband D Sreedhar, who worked as an AGM in a paper mill in Odisha, had died in an accident near Pappikonda village in Srikakulam district in November 2016. 
 
 Nagapadmavathi and other family members, however, concealed the fact from Rupa and her children. It was only some time ago that Rupa came to know about her hubby's death. She was inconsolable for several days and her father-in-law had decided to shift them to Jamshedpur where he lives. 
 
 "I was looking for a rented accommodation for them in Tata Nagar (Jamshedpur) and for a week I tried calling them but they did not pick up the call. Then I felt there is something amiss and came to Eluru and saw the rotting bodies," Rao who was in shock told TOI. 
 
 The Eluru rural police registered a case and sent the bodies to the Government   for a post-mortem.
