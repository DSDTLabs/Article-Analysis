AMARAVATI: The inability of urban civic bodies to identify vacant spaces has led to considerable delay in the execution of the state’s prestigious Anna Canteen  .

 The state government had planned to launch all canteens on or before May 28 to mark Telugu Desam Party's founding president NT Rama Rao’s birth anniversary. However, this deadline will not be met in all likelihood. The works have not even been grounded in over 95 per cent of the locations.
 
 The state government announced setting up of Anna Canteens almost three years ago. It put the project works on the fast track only recently as the ruling party wants to operationalise the canteens before assembly elections.
 
 The government gave its final nod at a cost of over Rs 388 crore about two months ago. Further, the municipal administration’s proposal of setting up 163 canteens in 14 municipal corporation cities and 53 towns were okayed. The government directed the municipal administration department to go for pre-fabrication mode construction in order to complete works within two months. The government sanctioned massive sums for each Anna canteen, keeping in view the high costs involved in pre-fabrication.
 
 As per plans, about nine canteens were sanctioned for Guntur city. Although, the town planning wing of Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) identified some locations in locations for construction, the corporation is delaying the handing over of sites to contractor.
 
 The state government awarded the Anna Canteens construction work to Shapoorji Pallonji Group in the city. Instead of pressing for the   project, the ruling TDP leaders are now busy making arrangements for the party’s annual conclave Mahanadu, which would also be held to commemorate the birth anniversary of party’s founding president NTR.
