 There’s no last minute fix. Plan your look and start following a grooming regime as much in advance as possible. Ten days ahead isn’t just ideal, it’s highly recommended.

 
  Go in for a change in your look. A good start would be a new hairstyle. Choose a look that makes you look as less scruffy as possible.
 
 
  Time to shave or trim your facial hair. The strongest trend this season: clean is back and here to stay. If you can’t lose the beard – trim it down and create neat lines all along the sides. This will make you look smarter and sharper.
 
  
 
 Break your personal care routine down to daily, monthly, bi-monthly, etc.
