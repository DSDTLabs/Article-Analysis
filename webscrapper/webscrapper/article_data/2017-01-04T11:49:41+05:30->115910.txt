 "The film's story had been with us for three-four years but we were waiting for the right actor. When Sanjay heard the script, he decided that 'Bhoomi' should be his comeback film. The last time Sanjay had a drink was at the Bachchans' Diwali party. He has sworn off alcohol ever since till the film is completely ready," the film's producer   told Mirror, adding that the actor wakes up at 5.30 am every morning to work out in the gym. "We are taking several of his assistants to Agra with us and setting up a gym in his hotel room so he doesn't lose time. We have also hired a trainer from UP so that he gets the Agra accent right. Sanjay sits with the writer and director to work on the script. He is also taking active interest in the casting as the actress who will play his onscreen daughter is yet to be cast."
 
 The film will be shot in 50 days in a start-to-finish schedule. According to Singh, Sanjay will be seen performing intense action at various locations in Agra, including the Red Fort, Chambal, Dhaulpur, Tajganj, Mehtab Bagh and Kinari bazar.
