HYDERABAD: A 34-year-old woman from the city has been literally kept under house arrest by her kafil (employer) in Jeddah.   Begum had gone to   on June 17 after she fell prey to the promises made by an illegal job agent. Her mother, Shameem Begum of Nawab Saheb Kunta, in a letter to Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj has urged her to rescue Nasreen. 

 Nasreen was promised a job in a supermarket by an agent but when she landed in Saudi Arabia, she was forced to work as a maid. 
 
 She was first taken to Dubai from Hyderabad. From there she was taken to Mecca and then shifted to Jeddah. 
 
 As she wanted to get back to India, she was kept locked in a room for four days. Her mother said Nasreen told her that the kafil had even starved her. Narseen's health deteriorated and, being an asthmatic, she had to be admitted to a hospital. 
 
 Nasreen has three daughters and a minor son in Hyderabad. Her kafil even demanded that he be paid Rs 3 lakh if she wanted to return. But the family cannot pay that. 
 
  leader Amjedullah Khan has taken the issue to the notice of the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia.
