VADODARA: Three persons were booked for forgery on the basis of a complaint given by ‘nazir’ of the district court here at Gotri police station.

 The accused Dhruvenkumar Patel, Raviranjan   and   had produced forged solvency certificates and given false information in an affidavit during bail application of Patel and Bhumiyar. Patel and Bhumiyar were booked and later arrested for assaulting and violation of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after a ruckus at MS University’s science faculty in September last year.
 
 Patel and Bhumiyar were granted bail by the court of additional district judge S M Rajpurohit in January. Parmar, who lives at   in Ahmedabad, came forward as bail guarantor for the duo. But, the police said that, Parmar submitted a forged solvency certificate with fake stamps of talati and gave an undertaking in an affidavit to the court that the certificate was original. A solvency certificate has to be submitted by bail guarantor to declare his financial position.
 
 However, later it came to court’s notice that the certificate was forged and the undertaking in the affidavit was also false. The court then cancelled bails of Patel and Bhumiyar and took them into custody. Later, the duo had again applied for bail which was granted. The court then directed the ‘nazir’ of the district court to register a case against the trio.
 
 The police have not arrested any accused in the case.
