Right when you think you are having a bad day, actor   steps in to make it a brighter day. Well, it is his initiative, RAOK, on   that we are talking about. The actor tweeted saying, 'To all my true friends and fans.. there is so much bitterness in the world around you 2day. Let's start something nice today. A   ' Random Act Of   ' do one for a stranger or a person in need.tell me about it and you will make my day and be my hero.....and I will retweet and repay you.Seriously Do one today..see the world around you change NOW..be my hero. Send me a video/pic of the person who U showed kindness 2-N we will start the magic together. Someone unrelated to you if possible (sic).'

 We spoke to the actor and he says, 'I think we need to spread some more love all around us. There is just so much animosity and fear all around us. I try and do an act of kindness as often as possible, say like giving a peanut vendor on the road a lot more than he asks for. Or providing a year's school tuition for a student who deserves it and not telling them about it. It's hardly `4,500 per year, but makes a huge difference. Giving a big hug to a man who looks like he is having a bad day, or giving a cop on the road a bottle of water or lemon juice will make his day. I feel that small things like these will make a lot of difference.' We couldn't agree more!
