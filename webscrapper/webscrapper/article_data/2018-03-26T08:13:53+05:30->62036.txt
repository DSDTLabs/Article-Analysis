THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the move to amend   ( ) statutory rules- that denies government employees the opportunity to apply for by transfer appointment -gaining strength, aggrieved employees are planning to move the court citing violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, the right to equality. 

 Complaints have already been raised by the employees with   (public service commission), AG's office and the legislative secretariat alleging a conspiracy by the 'government secretariat lobby' 'to make them ineligible for applying to KAS under Stream Two (by transfer appointment)'.
 
 "As per government notification on KAS statutory rules and orders dated December 29, 2017, all government employees including those with the constitutional bodies are eligible for by transfer appointment under Stream Two, provided their age is 40 years or below," said an employee with the PSC, preferring anonymity.
 
 The employee added that chief minister   has already made some remarks in the assembly in favour of the amendment.
 
 "The amendment procedure is yet to be completed. But, if the rules are amended and we are made ineligible for by transfer appointment in KAS, it will amount to a violation of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, and it could be challenged in the court of law," he added.
 
 The government employees in several posts including that of financial assistant, divisional accountant, block panchayat secretary and legal assistant are being appointed from the same list, and are eligible for inter-department or mutual transfers, the employees pointed out. "This is the feeder category for various posts and all are eligible to apply for by transfer appointment," another employee said.
