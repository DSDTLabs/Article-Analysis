TRICHY: The higher education curriculum in the country was being transformed in a way that it matched universities of the western countries but that would only take the country back to the colonial era, said S Chandni di, faculty of History,  . 

 Speaking at   as part of a national seminar on British rule, she said invasion of western forces three centuries ago ruined traditional trade and commerce and now education system was the target.
 
 Highlighting the intensity of western influence on our people despite intellectual brains from here are dominating overseas, she said westernisation of our education system will cost us our   methodology.
 
 Contributing to the basic infrastructure including that of the railway in the country during the pre-independence era, Britishers had their vested interest.
 
  Turning our country as a market for their finished goods, they had demolished traditional trade which was once dominating the world commerce.
 
 Now after 70 years of independence, the country is moving towards colonial era by embracing the western educational system. The choice-based credit system too is a step toward that while matching up to the western system of education, she said.
 
 Saying that history teaches us many lessons from the past and it is the duty of the history students to convey the message to the society so that history doesnâ€™t repeat itself.
 
 The Indian market is constantly being studied and a majority of the urban needs are being fulfilled by the companies in the western countries, she stressed on indigenous ideas to meet the local demand for the sustainable development of the society.
