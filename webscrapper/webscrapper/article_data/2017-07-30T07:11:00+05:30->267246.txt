Ludhiana: After facing criticism for randomly booking residents for covering their faces while riding two-wheelers, Ludhiana police commissioner R N Dhoke on Saturday partially rolled back the order and directed senior police officials to book only those found suspicious.

 The police commissioner had issued ban orders following the murder of pastor Sultan Masih, who was gunned down by masked motorcycle-borne assailants outside a church in Peeru Banda Mohalla of Salem Tabri on July 14.
 
 In a meeting with all ADCPs, ACPs and SHOs last week, the police chief had instructed officials to enforce the ban. The CP had also directed to take action against the violators and lodge an FIR.
 
 The   had set up special checkpoints and booked over 100 people under this drive.
 
 In the view of the criticism, the police commissioner on Saturday called a meeting with all senior officials and discussed the order released under Section 144 of the CrPC on banning face masks and getting tenant verification done.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (III) Suredra Lamba said, “The tenant verification driver would continue as conducted in the past. Anybody who would not get the tenant and servant verification done won’t be spared.”
 
 “In the meeting, it was also decided that no random people would be booked for covering faces. The police commissioner directed officials to book only those who are found suspicious,” added ADCP Lamba.
 
 The official said people with genuine issues, including allergy, would not be harassed.
 
 When asked about how police will identify suspicious persons, he replied, “The cops could easily identify suspicious persons out of their experience. Mostly young people up to the age of 35 years would be on radar.”
 
 Further on tenant verification, the official said, “If tenants are found genuine, the cancelation of FIR would also be considered. Besides, the focus would be on professionals like those running PGs or have quarters.”
