JAIPUR:   backed to normalcy on Saturday morning with grocery shops,  ,   opening after Thursday night’s clashes, though,   remained enforced in pockets of the city to avert any  .

 The district administration has blocked the internet services in order to clamp down on spread of rumours through social media accounts. “The   (RAC) and Special Task Force (STF) have been deployed in sensitive areas of the city to keep a watch over miscreants and ensure that peace is not disturbed,” district SP Akhilesh Kumar told TOI over phone. He added that senior police officials in the district are carrying out patrolling across the district.
 
 Tension had gripped the city on Thursday night after members of two communities clashed with each other over a minor issue near Kalyanji Temple area and pelted stones on each other. The police had to resort to lathicharge and Section 144 was imposed after clashes resumed on Friday morning.
 
 RAC and STF were rushed in from nearby districts of Jaipur and Dausa to ensure that situation doesn’t spiral out of control. The district administration on Friday and Saturday held peace meetings with the seniors of both the communities to restore law and order in the area.
 
 “Since Friday morning, no untoward incident has been reported so far. Hence, we are hoping that situation is very much in our control. However, we have kept the reserve battalions on stand by in case some people try to whip up passions,” a police official said.
 
 The entire district was turned into a virtual fortress with large columns of RAC and STF carrying out flag march across the district. “Areas such as Dujod Gate, Kalyanji Temple, Ramlila Ground Road, Ghantaghar and localities surrounding Karinagar are under scanner and adequate security arrangements have been made to maintain public law and order,” a police official said.
