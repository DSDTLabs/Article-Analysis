KORAPUT: A wanted Maoist carrying cash award of Rs 1 lakh surrendered before police in   district on Saturday, a day after Maoists observe Republic Day as Black Day. 

 Police said the surrendered Maoist, Digambar Poddar alias  , joined the Maoist organisation in 2013 and was wanted in five murders. The surrendered Maoist was carrying a 303 gun and was working in the cut-off area. After he realised that the Maoists are engaged in extortion and murdering people on false charges, he decided to surrender and join the mainstream, said SP (Malkangiri)  .
 
 According to the SP, the surrendered rebel will be rehabilitated as per the prevailing surrender policy of the state government. Also, we appeal to the misguided youths to surrender and lead a peaceful life, the SP said. Amid tight security, the Republic Day celebration passed off peacefully in the Maoist-hit districts of Koraput, Malkangiri,   and   on Friday. 
 
 Police said elaborate security arrangements have been made to thwart any possible Maoist attack as the Red rebels had urged people to observe the Republic Day as Black Day.
 
 The Maoists had put up posters and banners at several areas in Koraput, Malkangiri and Rayagada districts. Sources said the Maoists unfurled the black flag at a few places in Malkangiri district but no violence was reported. The Republic Day celebration passed off peacefully and no untoward incident was reported. "We had strengthened our security arrangements and policemen were on high alert," said SP (Koraput) Kanwar Vishal Singh.
