KOLHAPUR: The civic administration is likely to face severe opposition from   lines over its proposal to  .

 The proposal to increase the rates will be tabled in the next general body meeting to be held later this month. The   (KMC) claims the property tax has not been increased since the last four years and it is facing revenue crunch for initiating development projects.
 
 However, city mayor   has appealed to all the corporators to turn down the proposal when it is tabled. The same proposal was rejected by the corporators last year as well.
 
 “We are going to discuss the issue with the officials soon and will request them to withdraw the proposal. The hike was turned down last year keeping in mind the sentiments of the citizens. Several associations and organisations have already sent a petition opposing the proposed property tax hike,” said Faras.
 
 Currently, the property tax for buildings in the city is calculated with the base rates of 2012 and the civic administration’s proposal states that the ready reckoner rates of 2015 should be considered for revising the property tax rates.
 
 The property tax may increase by 35% considering the increase in the ready reckoner rates. On an average, the ready reckoner rates have been increased by 8% to 12% every year since 2012.
 
 “Instead of focussing on increasing the property tax, the civic administration should speed up the process to assess the new properties in the city and bring them under the tax net to increase revenue. Also, the administration should ensure that expenses on the staff are rationalised so as to make more funds available for undertaking infrastructural works,” Faras added.
