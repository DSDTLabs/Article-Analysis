AURANGABAD: History scholar   feels that the civic body has played a hand in damaging the 400-year-old lake in the heart of the city with the construction of a sewage treatment plant on its banks.

 He said that the lake built by slave king  , which is now situated in the heart of the city, was getting polluted due to the civic body's sewage treatment plant and the waste released from Cidco and Hudco areas for over 20 years. The lake is now known as Dr  , named after the well-known ornithologist.
 
 Ramzan, who has done extensive work on the history of the city, said that the lake used to have crystal clear water and would often be covered with beautiful lotuses. Tourists would gather around the lake and it was home to different migratory birds. 
 
 At present, the lake water has turned green and the number of migratory birds has dropped considerably.   pointed out that the AMC has done considerable damage by constructing a sewage treatment plant on the banks of the lake.
