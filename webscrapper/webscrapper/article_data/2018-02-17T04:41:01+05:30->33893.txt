A   Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) third-party food safety audit of campus kitchens at 12 top central institutions of higher education has found that providing good food to the best brains in the country is not a priority for most institutions.

 A majority of the institutions failed to clear the food safety audit. Common problems, especially for those ranked lower in the audit, include cleaned utensils retaining food residue, rodent droppings around the kitchens, reheating of food several times, kitchen staff wearing shoes in the kitchen that are meant for the outside, choked bathrooms and overflowing sinks where utensils are cleaned.
 
 FSSAI conducted the audits according to their draft food safety and standards (food safety auditing) regulations of 2017 for   Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi;   Bombay; IIT Guwahati; IIM Kozhikode; IIT Delhi; Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ( ), Kolkata; IIT Chennai;   Jodhpur; IIT Roorkee; and IIT Kanpur.
 
 At each institution, all kitchens and canteens were audited. Only most of IIM Ahmedabad’s and IIT Roorkee’s campus kitchens managed to pass the audit. The rest failed.
 
 The auditors assessed the canteens, hostel kitchens, guesthouse kitchens and cafeterias on six parameters — design and facilities, which checks how the cooking area is maintained and whether they have safe food-grade cooking utensils and equipment; control of operations, or how food is actually prepared; maintenance and sanitation; personal hygiene; training and record keeping; and other comments, if any. The maximum score possible was 114, a score less than 77 was considered “non-compliant”.
