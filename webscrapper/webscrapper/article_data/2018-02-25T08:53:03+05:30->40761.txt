CHANDIGARH: A day after   and   filed a complaint against   with Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the school authorities on Saturday redacted their decision and agreed to issue the roll numbers of the students studying in class X and XII. 

 The school sent messages via mobile to the parents in this regard. Parents had staged a protest outside school alleging that authorities have deliberately withheld rolls of their children studying in class X and XII and were forced to pay hiked fee along with late fees. These parents had also knocked the door of court on fee hike issue and the decision was stayed by the court. "Taking into account the interest of your ward, we are releasing his/her Admit Card for the Board Examination subject to the condition that the due amount has to be paid at the earliest so that the dues of your ward are cleared. This may be collected from the class teacher on Monday," read the message sent by the school.
 
 TOI is in possession of the copy of the message which has been received by  , MCPA president. "One of the parents had received this SMS whose roll number was withheld," he said. Commission has issued summons to school on Monday and has asked the school authorities to bring all the relevant documents in which they have asked the parents to pay the hiked fee. The parents in their complaint to CCPCR have said that they tried to deposit the fee but the school authorities refused to take citing that the parents had to pay the hiked fee. The district court had stayed the increased fee charged by school, parents said. The parents in October last year had levelled the allegations that the school had been demanding hiked fees despite a stay from a court. Subsequently, the parents had filed a complaint with education department, CCPCR, the school principal along with others.
