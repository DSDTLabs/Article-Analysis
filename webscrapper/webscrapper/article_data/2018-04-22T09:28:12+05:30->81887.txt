MUMBAI: The   may shift Pune’s   playoff games, scheduled for May 23 and 25, to Lucknow.

 
 
 
 “What works in Lucknow’s favour is the huge crowd capacity (around 50,000) of the stadium in that city. However, we haven’t finalised this yet. Rajkot and Kolkata are also in the running. We’ll send an (IMG) team to Lucknow on Tuesday, and should be able to take a call later that day,” a top BCCI official told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Lucknow, it is learnt, was supposed to stage a few IPL games this season, before missing out due to certain issues. The playoffs will be shifted out of Pune since the city is already hosting Chennai Super Kings’ (CSK) remaining IPL 2018 home games due to security issues in Chennai.
 
 Former BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah is keen on Rajkot hosting the playoffs this time.
