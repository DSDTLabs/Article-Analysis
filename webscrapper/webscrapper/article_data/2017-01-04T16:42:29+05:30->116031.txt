KOLKATA: Restaurants in Kolkata will soon have to put up display boards to let customers know if they levy a service charge. As per a new notification issued by the consumer affairs department, Government of India, it will be the customers’ discretion to pay the charge which is not a compulsory one.

 While a majority of the restaurants in Kolkata don’t include the charge, few of the rest declare it to customers. Around 20% of hotels in the state levy service charge, according to the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI).
 
 While a 14.6% VAT and a 6% service tax are compulsory on every food bill, several restaurants levy a steep 10% service charge. It was unfair to impose the burden on unsuspecting customers who often pay tips for the service, said Sudesh Poddar, president of HRAEI. 
 
 “Even though we have asked all our members to display if they are charging it, I believe it is unfair. It should be left entirely to the customers’ discretion since they are already paying taxes. In case one is happy with the food and the service, he or she will tip those serving the food,” said Poddar.
 
 He added that the new rule will impact hotels more than restaurants since a greater number of them levied a service charge on the room rent. “Instead of the food, they tag it with the room rent. Either way, it is unfair,” said Poddar.
 
 Most restaurants felt it was a fair move and will help to weed out an unjust practice. “The service charge should, at least, be declared which makes the new rule a good one. Ideally, it should be left to the customers just as we do,” said  , owner of   on  .
 
 Even though   don’t levy the charge, several new ones including a multinational fast food chain have a steep service charge. According to the restaurants, the charge is around 10%. “It inflates the bill and is unfair since scores of their customers pay tips,” said a restaurant owner.
