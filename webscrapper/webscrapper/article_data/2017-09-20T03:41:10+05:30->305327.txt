NEW DELHI: A day after two devotees of jailed ‘spiritual leader’   were killed while they were cleaning a   at the ashram in outer Delhi’s Mundka, police have arrested the manager and charged him for culpable homicide and causing grievous hurt due to negligence as a few others were injured when they tried to pull the men out of the sewer tank. 

 Probe revealed that the manager, Chand Sathi, had asked the two men Amarjeet (30) and Makhan Lal (27) to climb into the tank to clean it. However, they started choking due to the toxic gas. 
 
 Another devotee who was keeping a watch on them told police that the youths stopped responding to him after some time. He decided to descend into the sewer linked to the septic tank to check, but soon climbed out heaving for air and fell unconscious. The police and the fire department were informed about the incident. This was informed to Rathi, but he asked them to pull out the bodies and cremate them.
 
 The two cleaners were pulled into the open by fire service personnel around 5pm. They, however, were already dead by the time they reached the hospital.
 
 Police said the manager was being questioned about why no safety equipment was provided to the men for going into the manhole. Legal action is also likely against the ashram.
