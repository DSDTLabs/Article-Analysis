MUMBAI: Even as the   claimed that there were no malpractices, the   and   on Monday mounted pressure to press their demand for a re-poll in   and   constituencies owing to alleged large-scale malpractices and malfunctioning of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), attached to electronic voting machines. 

 According to reports in both the constituencies together, more than 1,000 machines were not functioning and had to be replaced. Palghar recorded a voter turnout of around 46.5% and Bhandara-Gondia constituency in Vidarbha a low voter turnout of around 40% . Political observers say that lower voter turnout usually favours the incumbent or those in power. 
 
 
  
 For CM Devendra Fadnavis, securing both the seats is important since they were earlier held by the BJP. Ever since Fadnavis took over the reins in 2014, these are the first Lok Sabha bypolls in the state. Chief Electoral Officer Ashwini   said machines failed at certain polling booths, but they were replaced immediately, so no voter was deprived of exercising her franchise. “We always have reserve stock of electronic voting machines. If there is a complaint, our technicians tackle them or we replace the machine. 
 
 We have not received any complaint of a voter not able to exercise his franchise,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar said all those voters who reached the polling booth before the deadline were given an opportunity to vote. The returning officer of Bhandara-Gondia constituency issued a statement that “it was observed that in some polling places VVPAT machine was showing error. 
 
 This is happening due to thermo-sensitive printing paper.” State Congress president Ashok Chavan said, “Our information is that more than 25% of the machines were nonfunctioning.” NCP leader Praful Patel and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar have demanded a complete re-poll in Bhandara- Gondia on the ground that the entire polling process was hijacked by the BJP.
