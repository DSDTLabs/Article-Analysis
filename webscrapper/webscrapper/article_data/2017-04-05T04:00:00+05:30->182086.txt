Vadodara: The sessions court rejected the interim bail application of notorious gangster Aslam Sheikh alias Aslam Bodiyo, which he had filed to attend to his ailing mother.

 Bodiyo had filed the plea on March 21 after his regular bail application was rejected by the court.
 
 Bodiyo had requested the court to release him for 20 days as he needs to be with his mother who is admitted in Aushadh Hospital for angiography. Bodiyo in his application had told the court that after angiography his mother might have to go through bypass surgery or angioplasty for which he has to be there to take decision and make arrangements for money for the same.
 
 Opposing his plea, the police filed an affidavit stating that in the past Bodiyo had flouted conditions in a case registered at Fatehgunj police station. Cops also filed statement of doctor of Aushadh Hospital along with the affidavit. 
 
 The doctor had told the police that Bodiyo’s mother has been suffering from the disease since 10 years and there is no need for his presence.
 
 Cops also told the court that they have recorded the statement of Bodiyo’s mother who told them that her daughter-in-law and other relatives are there to take care of her. It was also mentioned that if Bodiyo will be given bail, he will flee and 57 cases are registered against him at different police stations of the city.
 
 After hearing the argument additional judge R K Chudawala rejected Bodiyo’s bail application.
 
 Bodiyo has been in jail in connection with a prohibition case that was registered at Navapura police station in December last year.
