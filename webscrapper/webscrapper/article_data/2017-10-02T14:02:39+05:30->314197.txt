AMRITSAR: Senior   leader Sucha Singh Langah, who is wanted in a rape case, continued to elude police for the third consecutive day since registration of an FIR against him in Gurdaspur.

 Meanwhile, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member Kiranjot Kaur said the nature of the crime itself was unforgivable. “When an amritdhari (baptized) Sikh has sexual relations with a woman other than his wife, it’s is a bajar kurehat. He is no longer considered a Sikh. Good that he resigned and his resignation has been accepted. He stands disqualified from the SGPC,” she said.
 
 According to the Sikh Rehat Maryada, cohabiting with a person other than one’s spouse was one of the four transgressions (tabooed practices) amounting to apostasy. Other tabooed practices in a Sikh’s life are dishonoring one’s hair, eating meat slaughtered the Muslim way and using tobacco.
 
 Kaur, however, questioned the timing of the registration of the rape case against Langah. “Timing of the   is certainly calculated and manipulated,” she alleged.
 
 When contacted, Gurdaspur City DSP Azad Davinder Singh said, “We are conducting raids at several places and we have not been able to arrest him so far.” He also expressed ignorance when asked whether Langah was in Punjab or had managed to flee out of the state. “We can’t say anything about it for now,” he said.
 
 On the other hand, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president and Congress nominee from   constituency Sunil Jakhar expressed surprise over SAD (B) president Sukhbir Badal’s silence over Langah’s issue.
 
 “Sukhbir Badal has not bothered to utter a single word on the issue though two days have passed since the police filed the case,” he said.
 
 He also took a dig at SAD-BJP nominee Swaran Salaria for defending the former Akali minister. Jakhar said it was shameful of his opponent’s statement describing the rape case as an old one. “This doesn’t absolve Langah of the heinous crime,” he said.
