HYDERABAD: The SSC result declaration time being changed from 10am to 7pm surprised several students and anxious parents.

 While wondering why the government couldn’t postpone the results for a day, if they could not release it in the morning, parents felt that it was very stressful to make the children wait the entire day for the results.
 
 “Maybe the state had a valid reason to postpone the release. Instead of making the children wait till the evening, they could have declared it on Saturday making it easy for everyone,” said   K, parent of a class 10 student who secured 8.7 grade points.
 
 The student leaders, on the other hand, alleged the results time was moved because of the TRs plenary and added that the move has affected students from other districts too.
 
 “Government wanted all publicity on the TRS plenary and that is the reason why they shifted results. This is unfair, especially to the students from rural areas where the internet hubs close by 8pm. Think about students who won’t be able to check the results on Friday itself,” said  , official spokesperson of   and leader of Osmania University Joint Action Committee.
 
 Students too said that the government should have declared results in the morning.
 
 “For years, results have been declared in the morning. They should have done the same for our batch. The wait for results was too much,” said  , who secured 10-grade points.
