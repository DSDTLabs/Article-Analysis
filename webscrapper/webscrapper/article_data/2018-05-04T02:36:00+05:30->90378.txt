Nagpur: The Nandanvan police are now gearing up to register a serious offence against  , Ravi Machelwar, Sachin Padgilwar, Pintu Wasnik and Gajanan Munmune, for their alleged role behind fleeing with cash around Rs2.50 crore which was intercepted following a tip-off earlier this week at Prajapati chowk. 

 The four police informers, nabbed from a hotel at Mahabaleshwar by city police crime branch, are learnt to have acted at the instances of an officer of API rank who is attached to Nandanvan police station. No action has been initiated against the API bringing the officers of supervisory level also under doubt for shielding him. 
 
 Nandanvan police had seized cash Rs3.18 crore while the owner of the amount, Raipur-based Maple jewellers, had claimed through their representative that there was Rs5.72 crore in the car which the four informers had sped away after being intercepted by the officers. 
 
 CP K Venkatesham said the officers involved in the said misappropriation would face music at the end of the inquiry. “Zonal DCP (Nilesh Bharne) is already working on the case which would be taken to a logical end soon,’ he said.
 
 Nandanvan police have sent teams to Chandrapur and Raipur for further investigation.
