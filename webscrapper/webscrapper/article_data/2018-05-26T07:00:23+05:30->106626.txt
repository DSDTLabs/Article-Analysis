CHENNAI: Following a   order allowing the state government to reopen about 800   along highways, the   administration has asked district managers to identify outlets that “do not pose a danger”.

 During a meeting convened on Friday, Tasmac general managers instructed district managers to identify outlets, within the jurisdiction of local bodies, which meet norms laid down by a government order.
 
 Tasmac shops will reopen on highways with a bypass road to ease traffic. The retail outlets can also be reopened on highways that begin and end within a corporation, municipality, town panchayat and other local bodies.
 
 Outlets can be opened on sections of highway that extend to urban roads. Outlets will also be allowed within commercial areas designated for development.
 
 The state government had shut down around 3,000 Tasmac outlets after the apex court ruled liquor shops will cannot function along state and national highways. The the state government later reopened around 1,700 outlets on highways stretches within local bodies. About 1,300 shops were closed earlier this month when a public interest litigation pointed out that Tasmac had violated a Supreme Court order.
 
 After shutting down 1,300 outlets, the state government appealed in the apex court. The court on Wednesday ruled that the state may reopen liquor shops if they do not violate its earlier order. Last month, in its order, the Madras high court observed that the state government had opened 1,700 shops last year through a circular, without the individual consent of all district collectors.
 
 While Tasmac has begun work to identify around 815 outlets, it is only likely to open them later in view of the anti-Sterlite protests.
