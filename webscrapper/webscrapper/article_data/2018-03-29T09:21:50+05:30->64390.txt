LUCKNOW: BSP chief   came out in support of West Bengal CM   on Wednesday and said that the Centre had adopted a dual stand on the weapon wielding rallies taken out in Bihar and West Bengal during Ram Navmi celebrations. Banerjee thanked Mayawati on Twitter, saying: "You have exposed the BJP government. BJP government is scared as we are all working together." 

 In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mayawati said: "Instead of stopping such illegal and violent acts, BJP and PM   are trying to promote them by adopting a dual policy towards the two states that are involved. The Centre had reacted differently to the incident in West Bengal, which is led by   Banerjee's   while in Bihar, where it is part of the alliance, it has a different stand. Even though the Trinamool government has given directions to the police to take strict action against those who took out the rally without permission and while waving weapons, the Centre is trying to corner the government. On the other hand, in Bihar, where the son of a central minister was found involved, the government is trying to save him and is not taking the incident seriously."
