 In the film, Kamya Punjabi begins with a commentary on relationships. The story then shows the initial stages of love blooming between Pratyusha and her boyfriend Rahul, who also calls her his wife. They exchange messages, kiss each other and love spending time together. 
  
 Kamya then appears on screen again to unravel the next stage of love where distance begins to creep in. Rahul begins to keep away citing work meetings as a reason. This troubled relationship leads Pratyusha (called Shaalu in the film) to take to smoking and drinking, demanding attention from the man in her life. Back home, she accuses him of not spending time with her and cheating on her. Rahul suggests separation due to lack of love between them. They have a huge fight over several issues in their life and Rahul asks her to part ways from him.
 
  
  
 After this, when Rahul comes to Pratyusha's room to take his stuff, Pratyusha warns him that if he leaves, he won't see her face ever. Rahul asks her if she's trying to blackmail him. She tells him she won't die, but his need and importance in her life are over. While Rahul claims innocence that he hasn't had any woman in his life other than her, Pratyusha is seen to be not believing him. 
  
 Rahul walks out of the house, leaving Pratyusha broken. The film emphasizes on how Pratyusha could not express herself, and took shelter in loneliness and tears.
