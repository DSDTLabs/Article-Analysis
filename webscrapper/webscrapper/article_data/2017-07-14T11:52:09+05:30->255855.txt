DUMKA: The wife of a   has filed a complaint against a   in Deoghar for allegedly   

 In her complaint filed at Babadham Temple police station on Wednesday, Parinita Kumari, the   - director of Sri Krishna Institute of Public Administration - alleged that she and her friend were abused and roughed up by   on Monday.
 
 Parinita said in her complaint she along with her lady companion were manhandled by a group of local priests on their way to the sanctum sanctorum. "The moment the priests saw both of us joining the queue they started behaving like rowdies and called us outsiders," Kumari said. She added that even though she managed to get inside the sanctum despite "the chaos and a stampede-like situation" her companion was left behind.
 
 Trouble didn't end for her, as she claimed she was physically manhandled by one of the priets, Lallan Khaware, after she entered the sanctum. "He did not listen to my pleas. Despite knowing my identity the priest caught hold of my neck, abused me and tried to bang my head at the wall in front of me," Parinita told police.
 
 She said one of the priests rescued her from the clutches of Khaware and took her outside.
 
 Parinita alleged that the security personnel deployed in the temple compound remained mute spectators to the plight of another woman who too was dragged out by a group of priests. "It is high time the government rid the temple of priests to ensure dignity of women and common pilgrims," she added.
 
 "We have lodged an FIR," YN Jha, officer in-charge, Babadham Temple police station, said.
