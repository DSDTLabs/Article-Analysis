CHANDIGARH: Six days after Panjab University (PU) syndicate took back powers delegated by it to vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar  , the senate will on Sunday decide whether the powers delegated by it to the VC should be taken back or not?

 The senate in its meeting will also take a decision on the syndicate’s recommendation to report to the chancellor about taking appropriate action against the VC for “having filed an affidavit containing undesirable language against members of the governing body” in connection with the governance reforms.
 
 
  
 
 The syndicate had resolved to direct registrar to file an affidavit stating that the affidavit filed by Grover on behalf of PU without authority be treated as withdrawn.
 
 Top sources said lobbying to give back powers delegated by the syndicate to the VC was also going on. However, sources said a majority of senators were against the decision.
 
 Meanwhile, registrar   (retd) had taken legal opinion on the withdrawal of the affidavit. However, the opinion had stated that there was no need to withdraw the affidavit.
