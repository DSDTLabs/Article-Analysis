LUCKNOW: It will be after five years that Haj pilgrims will get  , Khadim-ul-Hujjaj, to assist them in Haj travel and rituals. The service providing one volunteer for every 200 Hajis remained suspended in the five years of the previous   government. The newly formed Yogi Adityanath government has decided to reinstate the service. 

 State   had not accepted any volunteers in that duration in view of differences on the issue between former minister of minority affairs, Azam Khan and Haj Committee of India (HCoI). The service was shelved since Khan wanted madrassa teachers, imams of masjids and other such to be taken in as KuH. 
 
 As per HCoI guidelines, KuH applicants must be employees of government/public sector units/statutory bodies. It disqualifies employees working on temporary/part-time/seasonal/contractual/ad hoc basis and even class A officers of Central or state government. With the number of Hajis increased from 22,000 last year to 30,000 this year, the state government is now targeting to depute around 150 volunteers under the 1:200 ratio. “In the absence of state-deputed volunteers, we had to depend on KuHs from other states and Centre for the benefit of UP-based pilgrims,” said Tanveer Ahmad, deputy CEO, State Haj Committee, UP.
 
 Playing an important role at various stages of the pilgrimage from assisting pilgrims throughout the journey and in rituals, to assisting the   (CGI) in Jeddah for organisation of pilgrims and their comfort, KuH are selected from all states as per HCoI guidelines. To support the KuH, 50% expenditure is borne by the HCoI and rest by the State Haj Committee. 
 
 At a meeting of HCoI in New Delhi on May 11, minister of minority affairs Mohsin Raza had also proposed extension of the volunteer service to qualify madrassa teachers, imams and muezzins of masjids and Muslim social workers.
