In the first such instance in the country and the second in the world, the liver of a 42-year-old brain-dead woman, who was a   recipient two years ago, was donated and successfully transplanted into a 66-year-old liver cirrhotic patient more than a week back.
 
  What makes the case unusual, say experts, is that the woman's liver was found fit to be harvested and transplanted despite she having been on   for the last two years since her kidney transplant.
  
  Immunosuppressive drugs are administered to make a recipient's body less likely to reject a transplanted organ. The longer a person is on such drugs, the more likely it is that the drugs would affect the body's vital organs rendering them unfit for transplant. The woman, who worked with   in Mumbai and also as a freelance reporter with different news channels, had received a kidney from her mother after she suffered renal failure two years back. She was declared brain-dead on January 1 this year after suffering intracranial bleeding.
  
  The  , experts said, has charted a new course in the field of organ donation as transplant recipients can now be recognised as potential donors on being declared brain-dead.
  
  Liver transplant surgeon  , who carried out the transplant at Sahyadri Hospital, Deccan, told TOI, â€œThis is the first case in the country's medical literature and perhaps the second known case in the world where a brain-dead person, who was herself an organ recipient and had been on immunosuppressive drugs, donated her healthy liver which was successfully transplanted into another needy patient."
