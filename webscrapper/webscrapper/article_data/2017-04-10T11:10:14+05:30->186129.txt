MADURAI: The coastal town of   is famous for multiple things and boat building is one among them. For ages, boats and   have been built and maintained in Tuticorin. Of late, the boat builders have adopted a new technique called “balloon method“ using   in place of logs and steel rollers to launch finished or repaired crafts into water.

 The boat yard at Tuticorin is located in a corner of the town fishing harbour. Both steel and wooden hull boats are constructed for costs ranging from Rs70 lakh to Rs1 crore. There are 254 fishing trawlers operating from   and another 32 sailing vessels operating from the old harbour area. Periodically, these fishing and sailing crafts have to be docked in the boat yard for repair and main tenance work too.
 
 After building or mainte nance work, the yard workers undertake the laborious task of launching the vessel back into the water. Using large wooden logs or steel rollers under the boat and steel ropes to pull, the boat is launched or docked.Considering the labour-intensive task involved, it may take even five days to put a boat back to the sea. There have been yard accidents too when the steel rope snapped or wooden steel rollers gave way .
 
 Recently , the boat builders purchased airbags from China to check these accidents. Made of rubber, the airbags are placed under the new or repaired craft. Using compressor motors, the airbags are filled and earth movers deployed to move the boat towards water. Four or five airbags are used at a stretch to float the vessel on land.
 
 After the craft moves out, the air-bags are decompressed and spread ahead of it to be filled in again. Using this method, a fishing boat weighing 70 tonnes was launched into the sea on Wednesday within hours attracting much attention in the yard.
 
 Using airbags prevents any last minute damage to the hull, according to boat owners.“Airbags are safer and do not damage even the paint“, said Anthonyappa who launched his boat on Wednesday .
