MUMBAI: Only 37% of men trust their wives with the keys to the family car, though 64% of women trust their husbands behind the wheel. 

  
  
 
 The finding was the result of a nationwide survey among car owners in 20 states. 
 
 Of the 2,100 respondents, 25% were from Maharashtra. The survey, titled Connected Families, showed that in  , mothers trust their children more: 44% of women respondents said their children always informed them and remained connected, as compared to 39% of men who said they trusted their children with driving a car. 
 
 As much as 62% of the respondents said they wanted to monitor their sons and daughters while driving to ensure safety. “As much as 44% of those who participated in the survey said they wanted to monitor their spouse, while 42% were worried about par
 ents being behind the wheel,” the survey said. 
 
 One in every five respondents from Maharashtra admitted to getting late while commuting, leaving their parents or spouse worried. At the same time, 19% of parents felt their children always “lied” about their whereabouts. The respondents were in the age group of 21-50 years. 
 
 The survey, conducted by Nissan India, tried to get feedback on concerns of family members by asking respondents how often they called their spouses when driving to new places. 
 
 The result: “The frequency of calling once in three hours was higher when the husband drove the car to new places. Women were more worried about their partners when they moved out of the home alone and travelled to a new place.” The survey said: “Chauffeurs are becoming an integral part of families in urban India and many carry children home from school. Hence, most people keep a check on their chauffeurs to be sure that they do not misuse their car when they are alone.”
