Noida is not quite there yet in terms of public art display, in comparison to Delhi and Gurgaon, but efforts are being made to give prominence to display of art in the city. A mall in Sector 18 had put up artist  's installations made of clay, which were supposed to be on display for a limited period. But the mall authority decided to extend the period of display because of popular demand. They did host a concluding ceremony, though, with dancer   performing at the event. The exhibition will be on till the first week of March.

  The travelling museum, called 'Excavations In Hymns Of Clay' is a first-of-its-kind concept of a solo project on environmental art. Manav told us, "Art doesnâ€™t belong to galleries only, it belongs to people, and so, art should be present wherever people are. Malls get footfalls of more than thousands of people every day, and so, if exhibitions are set up in such public places, more people get to see them. Now, as the exhibition has been extended till the next month more visitors will get to see it."

  The visitors at the mall told us that they were quite impressed with the initiative. Arpana Bishnoi, who lives in Sector 22 and was at the mall, told us, "I am glad to see that art is making its way even to the malls. In Delhi, I have seen galleries and installments, but in Noida, this is a new thing. After I saw it, I returned with my granddaughter to show her the art. This is a welcome change. We hope other malls will also follow, too."
 
  Another visitor, SR Saran, a businessman who has a shop in Sector 18, said, "We have been complaining about the absence of galleries in Noida for years. But now, at least these art forms are being displayed in malls."
