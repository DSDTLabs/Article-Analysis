Panaji: The state has not seen any decline in the incidence of breast cancer, though cases of oral cavity cancer have gone down in the last two-three years. Cases of lung cancer among women are also on the rise, said cancer surgeon Shekhar Salkar, joint secretary of Goa Cancer Society (GCS). Addressing a press conference, Dr Salkar recently said there has to be an intensive study to figure out reasons behind the rise in lung cancer among women in Goa. Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, professor, head and neck cancer surgeon at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, who also addressed the meet, said smoking was one of the factors behind this. Even if a woman is not smoking, she can be a passive smoker, which increases her risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer. He said there have been several cases of lung cancer among women who are exposed to ‘chulha’ smoke in Maharashta and other states.  Dr Salkar said about 1,200 cancer cases are detected in Goa every year which include about 200 breast cancer cases and 110 odd cases of lung cancer cases. He added the incidence of colon cancer is high, and in fact, Goa is at the top of the chart nationally. It is a lifestyle-linked cancer and the numbers will not go down unless people make lifestyle changes. The GCS along with Indian Medical Association (IMA), Goa chapter, has conducted several cancer detection camps across the state. The camps were held in Bicholim, Ponda, Margao and Bardez. The GCS along with IMA Goa is planning to organize three more cancer detection camps in the state.
