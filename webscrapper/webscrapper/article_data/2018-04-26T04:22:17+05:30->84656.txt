MUMBAI: A 38-year-old woman was arrested at   on Monday for pushing two of her   into the flesh trade for Rs 40,000. One of her daughters is a minor. Though the woman claims this was her first time committing an offence, the police will quiz the girls as well as go through the woman's phone call records to find out the facts. The woman has claimed that she needed the money on an urgent basis to pay power bills which had accumulated over the years. 

 The   police had received specific information that a woman was pushing young girls into prostitution. The police also learnt that the woman made bookings with customers on phone. The cops then set up a trap and got a bogus customer to call her up. The woman told the customer that she would bring along four girls for Rs 50,000. The customer bargained and she agreed to charge Rs 40,000. She told the customer that the girls were virgins and set up a meeting with him near a college at Bandra East. 
 
 When the woman reached the location, she had brought along two girls with her. She told the customer that the other girls would join them shortly. As soon as money changed hands, the customer gestured to waiting policemen and they ponced on her. On further investigation, it was found that the girls were her own daughters. One of them was 15 and the other was 19. The girls had dropped out of school. She had dressed them up and brought them for the meeting. 
 
 "We sent the rescued girls to a shelter. A case has been registered against the woman under provisions of the Prevention of Immoral   Act, IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. A magistrate court remanded the woman into police custody till Thursday.
