PANCHKULA: A 44.43% pass percentage pushed   to 16th position out of 22 districts in the Board of School Education   (BSEH) Class X exams, the results of which were announced on Monday.

 Out of a total of 5,026 students who appeared in the examinations, only 2,233 students passed in the district. The pass percentage of girls remained high. As many as 1,331 girls out of 2,502 passed the exams (53.20%). On the other hand, only 902 boys out of 2,524 boys passed the exams (35.74%).
 
 The overall pass percentage of Haryana was 49.73. A total of 3,65,688 students appeared in the examinations and 1,81,846 passed the examinations.
 
 R S Chaudhary, a former   vice-chancellor and a resident of Sector 2, said, “I am shocked to see the result. The main reason is that teachers only come to school to mark their attendance and take salary. I can bet that if the government conducts a test to check the efficiency of teachers, 70% of them will fail.” “Politicians are destroying education in Haryana owing to the scams in appointing teachers. Haryana does not deserve a bad result. Infrastructure also plays an important part in education, but there are no laboratories, libraries and proper electricity in schools,” Chaudhary said.
 
 District education officer Harminder Singh Saini said, “The result is not satisfactory. We are in the process of compiling the data and after analysing it, we will focus on areas where we lack.”
 
 The situation was similar in the Class XII results declared on Friday. Panchkula grabbed the 17th position out of total 22 districts with a pass percentage of 58.33.
 
 A total of 2,604 students appeared in the senior secondary regular exam this year, out of which 1,518 students passed.
