KOTTAYAM: The   (TDB) will assign the job of lighting the ‘celestial light’ (Makaravilakku) seen atop Ponnambalamedu near   on   to the Sabarimala thantri (head priest) from next year. Two thantris from the   are taking turns each year to perform the thantric duties in the Sabarimala temple. 

 According to TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan, the thantri who does not have any responsibilities in the Sabarimala temple during a year will be in charge of lighting the Makaravilakku in Ponnambalamedu.
 
 “The TDB will make a final call on this after an astrological consultation (devaprasnom),” said Gopalakrishnan. He also said that keeping the Makaravilakku lighted throughout the duration of the ritualistic offering (deeparadhana) on Makara Sankranti day is also being considered. At present, the ‘light’ disappears after flickering thrice on that day.
 
 He also said that this year the Makaravilakku was lit by the chief priest of Pampa temple N Parameswaran Namboothiri. It was decided in a meeting of the TDB about who will light the lamp. The thantri was also taken into confidence,” he said. “Earlier, the Makaravilakku was lit by tribal families. In the past few decades a joint team of forest and police departments is lighting it,” he added.
 
 Gopalakrishnan, however, said that he does not want to damage the faith of the devotees of the temple by saying that Makarajyothi and Makaravilakku are both the same. “Let both remain as different for the good,” he said. 
 
 Lakhs of devotees throng the hill shrine to witness the Makaravilakku. This frenzy to catch a glimpse of the flickering flame had led to a stampede in which over 100 people died in 2011.
 
 Meanwhile, tantri Kantaru Rajeevaru of Thazhamon Madom, refused to comment on the statements of the TDB president. 
 
 “I came to know about his statement. However, I don’t want to respond to it now,” said Rajeevaru.
