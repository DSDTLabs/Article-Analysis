AMRITSAR:The Sikh clergy directed community members across the globe on Thursday to boycott former director of the Sikh History Research Board of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Harjinder Singh Dilgeer, if he didn’t appear before the Akal Takht to clarify his alleged objectionable content against Sikhism in his books. Dilgeer had announced he would print Guru   without ragmala (composition of different melodies that can be employed in singing hymns) 

 However Dilgeer retorted saying, “There is no concept of priestism in Sikhism. I don’t recognize these priests, hence there is no question of appearing before them. I will now print Guru Granth Sahib without ragmala.”
 
 But Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani   while talking to TOI, said, “We have directed Sikhs not to have any religious, social or political relation with Dilgeer until he appears before the Akal Takht to give his clarification.” He added that Dilgeer had made highly objectionable remarks against Guru Granth Sahib, Amrit, Nitnem, Ardas, Kakar and  .
 
 The Sikh scholar, who has penned down and edited over 50 books, had earlier stated that he would print Guru Granth Sahib without ragmala if he was excommunicated from the Sikh panth. Asked why he would stick to his decision when Akal Takht had not excommunicated him, he said, “It is almost the same. They may claim it is not excommunication but there’s hardly any difference.”
 
 Earlier on June 16, Gurbachan Singh had indicated at summoning Dilgeer to the Akal Takht after a subcommittee constituted had held him guilty of making objectionable references against Sikhism. Dilgeer said he would get Guru Granth Sahib printed from China since it was not possible to get the Sikh religious book printed from India owing to restrictions.
