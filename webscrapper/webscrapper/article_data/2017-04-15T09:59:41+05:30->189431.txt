NAGPUR: Even as Nagpur station is considered among the best across Central India, passengers are a harried lot owing to a growing   menace on the platforms.

 There have been frequent complaints from passengers about dog bites inside station premises on Santra Market side of the station.
 
 On Thursday, a bank executive Jehangir Vazir (23) was bitten by a stray near the escalator on east side of the station. “After parking my bike, I was in a hurry to board   when suddenly a stray dog grabbed by ankle from behind,” said Vazir.
 
 Vazir said, “I shooed away the dog but before that, it had injured me. I just washed the injury and rushed to catch the train. I’m now taking anti-rabies vaccine.”
 
 There have been several complaints about stray dogs frequenting platforms and station. “We are in a hurry to catch trains and many times these dogs chase us,” said a section of railway employees who travel to   daily.
 
 “Any harm to passengers is sole responsibility of Central Railway, which should coordinate with civic body to end the menace. Dogs enter the station as there are many breaches in fencing from all sides,” said Mahendra Yelwatkar, a regular traveller to Gondia.
 
 PD Patil, Central Railway public relations officer (PRO), said, “Though there is no provision of compensation to dog bite victims, railways have written to NMC to look into the problem. In the past there have been drives to lift stray dogs from the station.”
 
 NMC veterinary officer Dr   admitted it was the responsibility of the civic body to handle the problem. “There have been no complaint from the railways in recent past. We will launch a drive to sterilize dogs at the station,” he said.
 
 As per guidelines, dogs are only to be released at places from where they are picked up. The eateries outside the station and beggars within the premises also complicate the matters by feeding these dogs.
