Shilpa, who is close to her family, couldn't stop her tears of joy on seeing them stand rock solid besides her as she achieved the title and award.

 
 
 
 Shilpa who misses her father terribly, was extremely close to him. But the darling daughter made him a part of the celebration by placing her trophy and a bouquet of flowers right next to his photo frame as soon as she entered her own house. This definitely will warm the cockles of her fan's hearts.
 
 
 
 
 Also now that the actress is back to the real life, looks like she is making the most of her cell phone, something that she missed for three long months.
 
 
 The actress has been posing for pictures constantly. Today, she posed for a selfie holding her Bigg Boss trophy besides her doting brother Ashutosh.
 
 Bigg Boss 11 that kick started in October, came to an end yesterday after being a complete roller coaster ride not just for the housemates but also for the viewers.
