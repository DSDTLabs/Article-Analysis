NAGPUR: “Everyone has to fight or find his own place in life. Same applies to poets too. At a time when nobody wants to choose poetry as a profession, we want to encourage and give them a platform to showcase their talent,” said Sumedh Mujmule, a poet, during ‘Nishadhund Pakhranche Ranjanparv’ programme.

 The poets’ meet was organized by Bahu-uddeshiya Yuva Manch, Hingoli, at Vidarbha  ,  , at 6pm on January 30.
 
 Besides Mujmule, who is the president of the manch, vice-president  , secretary Amit Duryodhan and Renuka Neware mesmerized the audience with their poetries. The poems were both in Marathi and Hindi.
 
 The show began with Amit Duryodhan’s poetry. “For peace, one needs to remain calm,” he said, adding, “Poetry is the best way to pour out one’s feelings.”
 
 Thereafter, Atirek recited a poem which was on love. His poem ‘Zindagi Yodha’, which beautifully described how a person fights all his life with different problems and comes out a winner, won peoples’ admiration.
 
 Mujmule, also an engineer said, “The idea of organizing such programmes came to my mind when I saw young poets struggling in the society to find a place to showcase their talent.”
