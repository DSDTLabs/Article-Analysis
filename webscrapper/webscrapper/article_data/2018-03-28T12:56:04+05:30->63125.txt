JAIPUR:   demanded if the government is increasing retirement age from 62 years to 65 years, it should make provisions of voluntary retirement along with it. 

 At a time when the senior resident   and resident doctors are opposing government’s move of contemplating increasing age of retirement,   has left it with the government to decide on it. “It is government’s jurisdiction to decide on age of retirement. But, we want that if government increases the age of retirement, it should also made provisions of voluntary retirement,” said a RMCTA office-bearer.
 
 If government increases retirement age from 62 years to 65 years of doctors, it will benefit 57 professors who will complete the age of retirement in next three years.
 
 At present, there are 235 professors and 40 associate professors available in various clinical speciality and super speciality and para clinical departments. “Of these, 57 professors will retire in next three years, which will create a deficiency, as per MCI norms consequently 106 post graduate seats will be affected due to retirement of professors in next three years,” said a senior professor. 
 
 However, the senior doctors claimed that increasing retirement age will not affect senior residents and others protesting against the government move in their career. 
 
 Besides,   met medical education secretary Anand Kumar demanding not to increase age of retirement of doctors. “Every year 1,800 students complete their MBBS and 1500 PG students passed out from medical colleges of the state. But, the government is not increasing posts of assistant professors, associate professors and professors in medical colleges of the state in the same proportion,” says JARD. 
 
 The JARD will take out a rally from SMS medical college to Trimurti Circle against government’s proposal of increasing retirement age of doctors.
