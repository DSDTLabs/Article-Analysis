PANAJI: With an eye on winning both the   seats in 2019, chief minister   will kick off his tour in Canacona on Saturday to interact with the people of the constituency.

 The decision was taken last year when Parrikar held a ‘booth vistarak’ meeting, a party initiative aimed at establishing direct contact people ahead of elections. BJP workers are of the opinion that there is resentment among a section of voters. 
 
 Sources said Parrikar’s tour will help BJP regain strength in places where its performance was poor in the assembly elections. The party had won 13 of the 40 seats in the 2017 state elections. Later,   and health minister Vishwajit Rane joined the saffron party to increase its strength to 14. 
 
 This is Parrikar’s first tour after taking over the reins of the state in March 2017. 
 
 Observers say BJP has a fair chance of retaining the North Goa seat, but could face a tough fight in South Goa. The party needs to deal with key issues like beef, Mhadei water-sharing and coal transportation. 
 
 Parrikar will start his tour from Gulem-Karmalghat in Canacona at 9am. He will interact with people at the Dhavalkhajan community hall in   at 9.45am. 
 
 He will then visit the Mallikarjun temple at Sristhal at 10.30am and meet people at the Shristhal panchayat hall at 11am. 
 
 Around noon, the chief minister will visit the Kotigao panchayat hall and later hold an interaction with people at Gaondongorim.
 
 The chief minister will also attend the bird festival at Cotigao, visit the playground at Potke-Belwada and   temple, go to Iddar-Loliem, Mahalwada-Poinguinim and Talpan jetty in Poinguinim.
 
 At 4.45pm, he will meet all elected representatives of Canacona taluka at the municipality hall. He will then inaugurate the party office at Chavdi-Canacona.
