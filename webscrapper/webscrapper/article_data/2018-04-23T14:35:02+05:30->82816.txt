Badami:There is a ‘local versus outsider’ sentiment brewing in   where   will be contesting , in addition to Chamundeshwari seat. Many feel the CM will retain the latter seat in the event of a win.
 
  Siddaramaiah decided to also contest from Badami, which has a substantial population of his community, the Kurubas. Party sources said this move would help the   consolidate Kuruba votes across the 90 constituencies in this region. An estimated 18 constituencies in north Karnataka have strong Kuruba presence with population ranging from 15,000 to 70,000.
  
  “If Siddaramaiah contests from here and wins in both places, this is the seat he will give up,” said Noorandrappa Malli, a resident of Gulledgud town, a hub of Lingayats, the other dominant community in Badami.
  
  “Chamundeshwari is his home seat. It is we who will have to face a by-election,” Malli contended. “Besides, it is much better to have a local candidate. If he (Siddaramaiah) is elected, we will have to go all the way to Bengaluru each time we want to reach our MLA.”
  
  This “local” sentiment was echoed by several people, who pointed to JDS candidate Hanumanth Mavinmarad, a zilla panchayat member. “He is available next door,” contended Srisaila Budhihal of Kudugunike village.
  
  The  , which is said to be determined to put a “strong” leader who can defeat Siddaramaiah in this constituency, has been discussing the names of Dalit leader B Sriramulu, Bagalkote MP PC Gaddigoudar and their chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa himself as candidates.
  
  The party, however, is now said to be considering pitting local candidate Mahantesh Mamadapur and cash in on the “anti-outsider” sentiment.
