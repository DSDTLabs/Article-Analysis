Panaji: Town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai blamed the forest department for planting “unwanted trees” resulting in wild animals entering and destroying the fields. 

 Animals aren’t feeding on the Australian Acacia planted by the forest department and as a result are straying away from the forest area in search of food, he said. 
 
 “We will have to revitalize the forest and look at the issue in a holistic manner,” said Sardesai. 
 
 He was speaking on the occasion of World Elder’s Day celebrated by the All Goa Senior Citizens’ Federation in Margao on Sunday.
 
 “The gaur is a state animal and the peacock is the national bird. Farmers want me to declare them as  ,” he said, pointing out that it is a matter for the wildlife board and not the agriculture department to decide.
