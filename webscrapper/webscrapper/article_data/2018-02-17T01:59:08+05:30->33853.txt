NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal ( ) on Friday directed the Delhi and Haryana chief secretaries to hold a meeting on February 20 and resolve the issue of high   content in the  . A Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report had found the level well past the permissible limit at four major points.

 CPCB had submitted an analysis report of ammonia level at Hathnikund barrage,   barrage, Wazirabad and Okhla water treatment plants. The level was the highest (24.9 ppm) at ITO. The permissible limit for ammonia is 0.2 ppm. The ammonia level at Hathnikund barrage was 0.6 ppm, 1.9 ppm at Wazirabad and 0.8 ppm at Okhla WTP on February 15.
 
 Following the submission, a bench headed by Justice Jawad Rahim asked the chief secretaries of Delhi and Haryana to convene a meeting to resolve the issue. They have been asked to submit the results of the meeting on February 21 and listed the matter for hearing on February 22.
 
 “The chief secretaries may summon the chairman or member secretary of Upper Yamuna River Board and member secretary of CPCB to participate in the meeting and assist in resolving the issue,” the bench said on Friday.
 
 NGT also noted that Supreme Court had passed an order where Haryana was directed to supply sufficient water to Wazirabad and Haiderpur.
 
 In the last hearing, the tribunal had asked CPCB to inspect the Yamuna water for ammonia and pollution levels after   (DJB) filed a plea last week saying supply in Delhi was being severely affected. DJB had alleged that Haryana was supplying “poisoned sewage water” to the capital with 2.6 ppm of ammonia content in it, even though the limit should not be above 0.5 ppm.
