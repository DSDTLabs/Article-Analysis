Panaji: While other states in the country struggle for funds during natural disasters, Goa, which has been lucky enough not to hit by any major disaster, has been unable to spend funds allotted to it towards state disaster management. 

 A source said disaster management funds to the tune of around Rs 40 crore have accumulated since 2005. The annual fund allocation is Rs 4 crore with 75% funding coming from the Centre. This year, the government is yet to receive the funds. 
 
 The central government, sources said, has   in the absence of a natural disaster; 5-10 % of funds for a particular year can be used for purposes such as capacity building and training manpower, the rest is to remain locked in fixed deposit. 
 
 “Since we have been very fortunate not to have been  , except for the Canacona floods a few years ago, the funds have remained unspent and have been placed in fixed deposit as per central guidelines,” the source said.
 
 There is a circular that even   where unused funds are to be placed in fixed deposit. “Presently, about Rs 9.75 crore is lying with them, which has to be placed in fixed deposits,” an official said.
 
 The state’s annual 25% contribution to the fund has also remained locked in fixed deposit, the official said. “It’s a large amount. Instead of simply placing the funds in fixed deposits for perpetuity, at least the state share could be utilised towards building infrastructure,” the official added.
 
 The state’s share of the unspent funds, another official said, could be invested in building a fire fighting station, buying fire safety equipment, training manpower on the lines of the   ( ). The Centre’s share would be better left untouched as the Centre can always ask the state government to return unused funds, the official added.
 
 “In that case, we will have to not only have to return the funds, but the interest, too,” the official said.
