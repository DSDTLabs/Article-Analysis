PANAJI: Popstar   woke up in Porto, Portugal, on Monday morning, to   from fans and well-wishers in Goa.

 Nothing new for the  , except for the fact that the flash flood of greetings began to read as mournful memoirs.
 
 Being his usual witty self, he decided to respond to his death hoax by publicly announcing that he was indeed ‘RIP’ - ‘Rocking In Porto’.
 
 On Sunday morning, a rumour began doing the rounds that Fernandes had passed away in Portugal and by late evening, the uncertain piece of news had turned viral on Whatsapp groups.
 
 Most people remained cautious in their reactions, but others wasted no time in scripting moving eulogies and sharing his popular songs.
 
 By Monday morning in Goa, even the skeptics began to believe the unfortunate news and even popular personalities from the music and entertainment industry began speaking about Fernandes’ ‘untimely demise’.
 
  
  
 
 The ‘Maria Pitache’ rockstar seems to have read every message he received before taking to Facebook by Monday afternoon in Portugal, to satirically state that he, himself, almost believed he died, before experiencing hunger pangs which proved that the news was fake.
 
 Wearing make-up that drew similarities to the members of the rock band ‘Kiss’, Fernandes laid to rest the rumour, saying, “I’ll miss reading your lovely eulogies.... no one gets out of here alive”. His tongue-in-cheek response received widespread appreciation from die-hard fans and friends on social media.
 
 Some fans even suggested that the singer, now settled in Portugal, release a new album to signal his comeback.
