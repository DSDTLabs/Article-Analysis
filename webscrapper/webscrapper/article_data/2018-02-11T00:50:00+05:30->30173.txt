Coimbatore: Parents today don’t want their kids just to be rank holders or top scorers, but want them to be confident individuals who can communicate clearly,  , a two-day admission and guidance platform for school education,  ,  ,  

 “Most parents wanted to know what co-curricular activities we offer,” said a teacher from a CBSE school. They, she said, also asked us whether the course structure would be stressful or burdening on their kids. “Parents now seek a holistic way of education,” the teacher added.
 
 The event, which was attended by several residential and day schools across the country, saw eager parents along with their children approaching representatives of schools to know about various boards of education and teaching methods.
 
 A parent, who had come along with her son who is in Class X, said she was looking for schools that put less academic burden on students. “I also wanted to identify the schools, which offer vocational courses,” she said.
 
 The main motive of the event was to educate parents on the difference between various boards of education, said Aakash Jadiya, vice-president of Educationista. “Parents are confused about different boards of education and they don’t know how their kids’ future career paths get shaped over the years if they put them in a particular board,” he said.
 
 Besides bringing schools from various locations and boards under a single roof, the event also featured seminars that threw light on various boards and the options they open up for students.
 
 The event, which is into its fourth edition in the city, has around 10 schools this time. It is held every year at various cities from October to February. Last year, the event saw around 1,500 footfalls in the city. It will conclude on Sunday.
