NEW DELHI/PUNE: The southwest monsoon arrived in the south   on Friday and is likely to make an early entry into   within the next four days, the   said. If the forecast holds, monsoon will arrive this year at least three days ahead of normal date. 

 
 IMD weather models indicate that the monsoon may progress rapidly into central, east and northeast India by June 14. 
 
 
 
 Good rainfall activity is likely over parts of central India after May 31 till June 6 and probably, during the first half of June. “Rain activity at the moment is being supported by   (MJO), a weather disturbance that moves eastwards roughly along the equator. This indicates that the Indian monsoon should make good progress at least in the first week under MJO influence,” said M  , director general (meteorology), IMD. 
 
 Development and strengthening of two systems almost simultaneously over the   and Bay of Bengal will not only aid the monsoon’s onset over Kerala, but will push the rain-bearing system northwards, officials said.If the indications hold, the period from June 1 to 7 will bring above normal rainfall over Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, parts of Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana and east India like Odisha, West Bengal.
