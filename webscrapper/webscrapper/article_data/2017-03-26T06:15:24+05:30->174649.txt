BENGALURU: Last month, energy minister D K Shivakumar assured Bengalureans of an outage-free summer. But the promise seems to have fallen flat as citizens are reeling under frequent power cuts. Saying it has enough power to meet the city’s demands, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has attributed the disruptions to outdated transformers.

 While Bengaluru geared up to celebrate Earth Day (an hour without lights or electrical appliances on) on Saturday, residents said there was no point in making the effort as power supply is snapped for an hour anyway. “Every day is Earth Day for us. We see power cuts for an hour in the morning and an hour at nights,” said a resident of HSR Layout. South and east Bengaluru are the worst hit because of technical difficulties in generating power during peak hours.
 
 Bescom MD   told STOI: “We have been receiving complaints from sub-stations in south and east Bengaluru and have decided to enhance the capacity of the transformers. We have surplus power to meet the city’s requirements, even during peak load. hours. Old transformers and overloaded transmission lines, especially during peak hours, are causing the outages,” he explained. Officials from the power utility, however, said work on ironing out these technical problems, can begin only by mid-April as school examinations are on. 
 
 Bommanahalli, HSR Layout, Bannerghatta, Kadubeesanahalli and surrounding areas in south Bengaluru will continue to experience one-hour power cuts. In east Bengaluru, Thanisandra, Narayanapura, Babusapalya, Ramamurthynagar, KR Puram, Whitefield and surrounding areas will continue to be affected. 
 
 What minister had said
 
 Shivakumar had said in February that   accounted for surplus power of up to 20%. “This is the first time we have achieved surplus power generation,” he had said, pointing out that the present consumption was 195 million units per day, while supply was in the range of 200-230 million units per day.
