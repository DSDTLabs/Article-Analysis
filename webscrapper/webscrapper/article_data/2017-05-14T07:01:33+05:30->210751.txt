HYDERABAD: With two major road accidents in the city still fresh in memory, another road   took place at busy Madhapur on Saturday night in which a biker died and four others suffered injuries. 

 Around 7 pm,   Kumar, an assistant manager with East Coast Logistics Private Ltd, was driving a Scorpio from   to 100-feet road in Madhapur when he accidentally hit a car, police said. Fearing he might be attacked, Basanth tried to drive away and, in panic, ended up hitting two more cars. The two cars in turn crashed into four bikes. A biker, V Rama Krishna, 55, died and four others suffered injuries after those cars went over them. The bikes were completely damaged. 
 
 Rama Krishna, who used to work at Kala Jyothi printing press, was riding a Pleasure bike. He was a resident of New Bakaram in Gandhi Nagar. 
 
 Locals rushed to the accident spot and thrashed Basanth Kumar. The injured people — Shankar, Fakru Bose, Shaik Sule Bhasha and Shankar — were shifted to a private hospital. 
 
 Madhapur inspector R Kalinga Rao said Basanth was not drunk and ended up crashing into other vehicles in a bid to escape from the accident spot.
