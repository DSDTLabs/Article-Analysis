CHANDIGARH: The rollback of   by Panjab University is not a   parties, but that of students, SOI president   claimed here on Tuesday. 

 Randhawa said most student bodies had put up a united front when police had cane-charged students protesting the decision on April 11. "So, student bodies should stop taking credit for this victory," Randhawa said.
 
 Randhawa described the rollback as a victory of student unity and all organizations who participated in the struggle. "It is unfortunate that some organizations have jumped into the 'credit war' and started taking the whole credit of the rollback," added Randhawa. Members of SOI had also initiated a campaign to collect money to donate it to the VC office, as a mark of protest against the fee hike. Last week,   donated Rs 940, collected from students, to the dean student welfare (DSW) office and had also demanded the office to put the money before senate meeting on Sunday.
 
 Following widespread demands and a protest that turned violent on April 11, teh PU senate had on Sunday unanimously decided to reduce the fee hike ranging from 400% to 1,100% in different courses to 10% in a rollback that can be termed as a victory of the students' struggle.
 
 Following the April 11 protest, after which the chief security officer of the varsity had even demanded sedition charges against the students, students had been pressuring the varsity to limit the fee hike it had announced in March this year. In some courses, the varsity had gone ahead with a hike of up to Rs 82,000 a year, raising many eyebrows in the student community.
 
 For the violence in the April 11 protest, the ABVP had squarely blamed Left-leading groups on the campus.
