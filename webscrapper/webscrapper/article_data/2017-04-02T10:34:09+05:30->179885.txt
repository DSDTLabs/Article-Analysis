PANAJI: Apparantly stung by criticism that the  , he is part of, has failed to protect the interest of Goa’s   in the apex court, Fatorda MLA   said the government should file an independent petition against the Supreme Court’s order to ban liquor stores and bars within 500 metres of national snd  .

 “The excise laws state that no shopkeeper shall sell liquor to persons who are drivers and conductors of buses, taxis and trucks. The spirit of the Supreme Court’s judgment is already followed in Goa. This decision will unnecessarily impact the business and livelihood of the locals. That’s why we should move for an independent petition,” Sardesai said, adding that “liquor is part of the Goan way of life and the state has been punished by the sins of the past government”.
 
 The Goa Forward leader laid the blame on domestic tourists who don’t drink responsibly and said that “instead of going for a ban, the current laws need to be implemented better. 
 
 “Outsiders visiting Goa don’t follow rules and they abuse women. The laws should be better implemented,” he said.
