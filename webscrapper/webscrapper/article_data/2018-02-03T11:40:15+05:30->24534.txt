BENGALURU: Even though   stocks rallied past its record fourth quarter results with $1 billion of profits, the ecommerce giant ended 2017 with an international loss of $3 billion — largely attributed to its India spends. For the same period a year ago, Amazon had reported losses of about just over $1 billion.

 According to the latest results filed by the Seattle-based company, it reported a $919-million loss in the final quarter of 2017 in its international business, which is marginally less than the third quarter loss of Amazon at $936 million.
 
 As reported by TOI earlier, due to the growing intensity of its local battle here with homegrown rival  , Amazon had already incurred losses to the tune of $2.1 billion for its global business.
 
 The company has been aggressively investing in India to build infrastructure and bring popular global products at discounted rates.
 
 Amazon has introduced Prime and   at promotional rates and is in final stages of launching Prime Music and its audio book business Audible in the country. “India continues to be a good story for us...In fact, more Prime members joined India’s Prime programme in the first year than we’ve seen in any other country in the history of our world,” said  , CFO, Amazon.
