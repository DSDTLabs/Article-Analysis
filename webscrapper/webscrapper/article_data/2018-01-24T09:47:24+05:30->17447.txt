CHANDIGARH: Fault lines in the   came to fore on Tuesday when two councillors nominated by the party did not show up to file nomination papers for finance and contract committee (F&CC) elections scheduled for January 29. Last date for filling nominations was Tuesday. MP and MC ex-officio member   and former MP   were also present.

 BJP councillors Rajesh Kalia from ward number 7 and   from ward number 20, who are said to be from local BJP chief Sanjay Tandon’s group, did not come to file nominations, forcing the party to field Anil Dubey and Farmila as replacement candidates. The two councillors and Sanjay Tandon did not respond to repeated phone calls.
 
 Mayor   said, “The four names were announced by party high command after which they were duly informed to file nominations for F&CC. But two councillors did not arrive and the party high command was informed. Later, two alternative names were given by the party and the nomination procedure was completed in time.”
 
 BJP has fielded Raj Bala Mallik, councillor from ward number 2, Hira Negi from ward number 13, Anil Dubey from ward number 24 and Farmila from ward number 6. With a strength of four councillors,   has fielded only one councillor, Gurbax Rawat from ward number 9.
 
 The BJP-SAD has 21 of 26 councillors in the new house. Four are from the Congress and one is an independent. With these nominations, F&CC elections appears to be a formality as election of the members may be held unanimously.
 
 The party is divided into two groups led by local MP Kirron Kher and Chandigarh BJP chief Sanjay Tandon. Both were engaged in a conflict before the Mayoral elections.
