BATHINDA: The family of slain gangster   Gounder has demanded an investigation into his killing in Rajasthan on January 26 evening, saying that he was betrayed by a cop he knew since childhood.

 The family said Gounder wanted to surrender and was in touch with police, but they killed him after taking him into confidence. The family has said it will approach the   and Haryana high court. Gounder’s uncle Gurbhej Singh, a resident of   village, said police officials had called him to Abohar to make him surrender, but they misled him and killed him. 
 
 Gounder was cremated amid tight security at his native village, Sarawan Bodla in Muktsar. Hundreds of villagers attended the cremation where police kept an eye over the happenings. 
 
 Gurbhej said he had a word with Vicky on January 26. “He told me one of the policemen, who was a key member of the police team that carried out the encounter, was known to him and studied with him at his sports school in  . That cop suggested he surrender. Prema Lahoria (who was killed along with Gounder) warned Vicky against meeting the policeman, but he did not listen and went to meet the policemen at Hindu Mal Kot, instead of Abohar. We want the state government to investigate into this. Else, we will approach high court soon,” he said.
 
 Gurbhej said they would meet officials in   and then approach the court.
 
 Police have rubbished the claims made by the uncles of slain gangster Vicky Gounder. Punjab Police organised crime control unit (OCCU) AIG  , who headed the encounter, termed the claims as “totally false”. “We have evidence to prove it was a genuine encounter. We got a tip off about Vicky and his accomplices hiding in Abohar, near Rajasthan border, and we surrounded the house where they were hiding. The gangsters started firing at the police and we retaliated. Why will anyone surrender in a secluded place in Rajasthan?” he asked.
