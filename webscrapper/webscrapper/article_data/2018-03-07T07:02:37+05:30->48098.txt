AGARTALA: Former RSS volunteer and gym instructor   was elected as the leader of   legislature party in   on Tuesday. He will be sworn in as the 10th chief minister of the state and the fourth BJP CM in the north-east region on March 9 at a grand function in Agartala in the presence of Prime Minister  .

 The BJP legislators also elected party’s tribal leader and a scion of the royal family, Jishnu Dev Varma, as the deputy chief minister. Dev Varma, 59, is, however, yet to be elected as election in his Charilam constituency has been deferred till March 12 following death of the CPM candidate. He is the richest among all the candidates who contested the polls.
 
 BJP has filled up the two top posts of the cabinet with its own men leaving its ally, Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura fuming. The IPFT-NC was promised the post of deputy chief minister by BJP when the pre-poll agreement was signed. Their president NC Debbarma told TOI that he is meeting Himanta Biswa Sarma here on Wednesday to resolve all issues, including that of the post of the deputy CM.
 
 “There is no question of being satisfied or dissatisfied. There are a number of issues that need to be resolved — the issue of deputy CM, the number of berths and the portfolio that we will get. After that, if we have reason to believe that we have not been given due importance, we will have to consider other options. One way out is offering an outside support to BJP or we may not even be a part of the government,” Debbarma said. Soon after their election, Deb and Dev Varma drove to Raj Bhawan where they staked claim to form the government before governor Tathagata Roy. The state council of ministers is limited to 12 and with two top posts already filled up, there will be 10 more berths to be distributed between the two allies.
