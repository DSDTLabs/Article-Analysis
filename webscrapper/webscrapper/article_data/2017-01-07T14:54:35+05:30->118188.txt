The tussle between the producers and exhibitors seems to be getting murkier in Mollywood. For the past few weeks, no new Malayalam film had been released in theatres here, the sole exception being Dr Biju's  . The theatres under the warring association - Kerala Film Exhibitor's Federation under Liberty Basheer, has now been denied even films from outside Kerala, the prime one being   starrer  . It is being reported that the Federation was banking on other language films to amp up the revenue, and prove that they can survive without Malayalam films. However, it doesn't look like that will happen, as the producers have clamped down on all films coming their way.
