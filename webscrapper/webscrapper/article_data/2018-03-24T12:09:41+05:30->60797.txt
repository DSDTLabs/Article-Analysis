HYDERABAD: This is something to cheer. Corrections in   cards can now be done in post offices as well. India Post,  , has made this unique facility available in 259 head post offices and sub-post offices across the state.

 Close to 139 post offices in Hyderabad and   and suburbs will also offer this facility.
 
 “Aadhaar card holders can visit the nearest post office and show proof of documents like SSC for date of birth and electronic photo ID card/ passport for address proof for carrying out the corrections,” a senior postal official said. Once the corrections are made in the card, they will be uploaded to the UIDAI server. Once the updation is over, a fresh card will be issued on the same 12-digit number to the card-holder’s address, he said.
 
 A senior official said it will take 10 minutes at the counter to carry out the corrections. After the corrections are made, a photostat copy will be given to the card-holder.
 
 For services like biometric update and demographic update, postal staff will collect Rs 25 for each service.
