Trichy: A two-member team from the Medical Council of India (MCI) carried out an inspection during the practical examination for the 150 MBBS students at the KAP Viswanatham government medical college (KAPVGMC) here on Thursday. 

 The inspection that commenced in the morning went on till the evening. The exam was conducted in four halls at the hospital while the team observed whether the college is following guidelines laid down by MCI for conducting practical exams.
 
 Thursday’s visit was crucial for the college because it was the final year examination for the 2013-14 batch which had 150 students for the first time. 
 
 Established in 1997 with 100 MBBS seats, the college was upgraded with 150 seats by then chief minister J Jayalalithaa during the academic year 2013-14. Since then, MCI has been visiting the college and Mahatma Gandhi memorial (MGM) government hospital attached to the college to check if they had the required faculty, bed strength and other facilities for quality medical education for 150 students. MCI would check the facilities for five years from the inclusion of additional seats.
 
 “MCI team inspected the practical examination. They were satisfied with the guidelines followed by us in conducting the examinations. The one day inspection was over,” dean Dr G Anitha told TOI. 
 
 There will be another inspection by MCI in the college next month for their annual visit to check the facilities available for medical education. 
 
 “The next visit of MCI may take place in a month. We have fulfilled the requirements laid down by MCI by appointing faculties and providing a good environment for the students to learn,” said Dr G Anitha.
