CHANDIGARH: With a day to go before campaigning for the assembly polls officially comes to a close,   “permanently expelled” three more rebels who were contesting as independent candidates.

 Dirba block panel president Baldev Singh, Dirba-II block committee chief Jagtar Singh, and Jalandhar former mayor Surinder Mahey have been removed for “anti-party activities”, said an order signed by Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh.
 
 With the latest expulsions, the party has ousted 21 rebels so far for refusing to withdraw from the electoral race in favour of the official party candidate in the fray from different assembly segments of the state. The party leadership had decided to take strict disciplinary action against those refusing to toe the party line with regard to contesting the assembly  , while continuing with its efforts to amicably persuade the rebels, some of whom had acceded to Captain Amarinder’s personal request in the matter.
