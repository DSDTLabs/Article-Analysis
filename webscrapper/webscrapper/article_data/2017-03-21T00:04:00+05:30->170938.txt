Jaipur: After witnessing increase in vehicular pressure, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has once again initiated exercise to widen Govind Marg, which connects Tonk Road and Delhi Road.

 The JDA has proposed to widen the road up to 100 feet between JLN Marg and Agra Road crossroad. The work will be taken up after receiving approval from urban development and housing (UDH) minister , Srichand Kriplani.
 
 According to the officials, as major part of the road falls under Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) periphery, JDA will propose to transfer the work after receiving the approval. Widening of the road has become a necessity as width of the road has been reduced to 55 feet at many places.
 
 Though the JDA has floated the proposal, it would be a difficult task for JDA to widen the road as many shops will be demolished. “Many shops are constructed on zero setback of the road. It would be a herculean task for JDA to displace and compensate so many affected owners,” said a JDA official.
 
 As there are long traffic jams in this area, the JDA during Congress tenure had proposed to construct an elevated road from Govind Marg to Narain Singh Circle. However, the project was shelved after facing strong protests from the Govind Marg Market Association.
 
 The widened road would provide better connectivity to heavy vehicles on the Jaipur-Delhi Highway (NH-8) that enter the city every day. The official said as in the past projects where heavy traffic was eased around Transport Nagar, this plan is for controlling traffic jams from Govind Nagar to Narain Singh Circle.
 
 Other than this, the JDA has also proposed to widen Hawa Sadak up to 120 feet. The road will be widened between Bais Godam Circle and Sodala. Similarly, JDA has proposed to widen Ashok Marg to 120 feet.
