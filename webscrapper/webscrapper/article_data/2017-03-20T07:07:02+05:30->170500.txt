COIMBATORE: The three-day meet of   (ABPS), the highest policy making body of the RSS, commenced in Coimbatore on Sunday with the saffron outfit hitting out at the West Bengal and Kerala governments.

 “The situation in West Bengal is alarming,“ said RSS national joint secretary V Bhaigaih accusing the ruling All India   of tacitly supporting Muslim fundamentalists in West Bengal.
 
 The crucial meeting, touted to prepare the ground for the saffron outfit's growth in south India, also slammed Kerala's Left government for the attacks on BJP workers. “RSS cadres have been attacked by CPM in Kerala from 1947. More than 40 functionaries from Congress and 16 CPI workers were murdered by the CPM in Kerala, which shows its intolerance,“ V Bhaigaih said and added that a resolution would be passed at the meet to bring pressure on Centre and West Bengal government to protect Hindus. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the ABPS meet in augurated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat at   university, Bhagaih said a resolution would be passed to pressurise Centre and West Bengal government to protect Hindus.
 
 “The West Bengal government led by   has been supporting Islamic fundamentalists, Jihadis for their vote banks for the last three-and-a-half years. The state has witnessed murders, violence, and arson against Hindus. More than 200 houses belonging to Hindus were burnt by Muslims in West Bengal. The state government and the West Bengal police are being mute spectators on attacks against Hindus,“ alleged Bhaigaih. During the CPM rule, Islamic fundamentalists had attacked Hindu organisations and not individuals. “We hoped the situation will change for good after   came to power in the state. But within few months, the situation turned worse because of Trinamool party's vote bank politics'' he said.
 
 He said the Sangh's work has been continuously increasing in a phased manner in the last ten years.
