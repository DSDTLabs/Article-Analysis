NAVI MUMBAI:   has tweaked the relief and rehabilitation (R&R) package the second time for villagers affected by the international airport project. It has forwarded a fresh list of demands made by the villagers to the state government. 

 “Assuming that the government will give its approval, we have started working out the extra bit that needs to be incorporated in the package,” a Cidco official said. “Our aim is to vacate the 10 villages in the core aeronautical area by May-end,” the official added.
 
 The delay in the project has given a window to villagers to table their demands. “Once the blasting and cutting of the hill is over, the villagers would be encouraged to shift,” another Cidco official said.
 
 Cidco has agreed to recognize double property titles like in the case of a spouse or spouses having more than one property. The revision will make some of the 3,500 families living in the core area eligible to more land. Cidco had earlier pegged a maximum area of 700 sq meters for any household to be considered for the package. However, they were forced to relent due to the persistent pressure by the villagers.
 
 “We will recognize additional area to be factored into the package if it is beyond 40 sq m,” the official added. 
 
 The package provides for three times the roof area of residential properties in ancestral houses. In case of commercial areas, the package includes the same plot size of the establishment. The villagers will be shifted to six plots in Vadghar and Wahal and one in Kundewahal.
