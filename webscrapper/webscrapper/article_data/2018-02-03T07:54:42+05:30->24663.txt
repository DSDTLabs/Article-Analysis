CHENNAI: A special team which took   gold heist suspects   and   into custody recovered 1.5kg   from a pawnbroker on   in the city. 

 The gang had drilled a hole and decamped with around 3.5kg gold from a jewellery shop in Kolathur last November. 
 
 Police said Nathuram disposed of the gold the same day he had stolen it. 
 
 "After selling 1.5kg gold in Chennai, he took the remaining 2kg to Bengaluru and sold it off through a friend. He is well known to another pawnbroker in Bengaluru," said an investigating officer. "Nathuram carried the gold to Bengaluru by train," the officer added.
 
 During interrogation, Nathuram and Dinesh revealed where they fenced the loot. Police then took them to Bengaluru to recover the rest of the stolen gold. Police said Nathuram and Dinesh told them that they have been involved in 20 other burglary cases - 10 in Bengaluru and another 10 in Hyderabad.
 
 Nathuram, picked up in Gujarat after city police inspector S Periyapandian, part of a special team sent to apprehend the burglars, was shot dead during a raid at an abandoned brick kiln at a village in Rajasthan's Pali district on December 13 last year.
 
 A police team brought Nathuram, Dinesh and   from Rajasthan to Chennai on January 26. 
 
 The three men were detained in Puzhal prison. On Tuesday, the three were produced before the magistrate after police sought their custody for interrogation.
