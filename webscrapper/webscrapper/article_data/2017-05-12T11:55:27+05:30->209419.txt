ROHTAK: The IIM   has finalised the syllabus for a certificate programme for defence personnel who had either completed their tenure or are about to retire.   director   on Thursday gave details of the contents of the programme.

 He said the programme would have specific courses on leadership and innovation, market research and analysis, economics, data analysis, management information systems, financial management, accounting, marketing management, supply chain management, project management, operations management, business strategy and human resource management. 
 
 “Working for the corporate arena demands that professionals should be in harmony with corporate life. Our specially designed programme for armed forces will provide an inter-linking bridge to them to re-orient themselves towards their new professional careers in the corporate world,” said Professor Sharma.
 
 An   spokesperson said like other management programmes conducted by the institute, the armed forces programme would benefit former officers with its unique pedagogy- a combination of case method, lectures, exercises, simulation, and projects.
 
 Every year, through the programme IIM Rohtak will support between 50 to 80 ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen with their transition into corporate employment after leaving the defence forces. Besides utilizing the service of best resources and faculty of all relevant areas of IIM Rohtak, the institute will also invite professionals from the industry to further enrich the programme.
