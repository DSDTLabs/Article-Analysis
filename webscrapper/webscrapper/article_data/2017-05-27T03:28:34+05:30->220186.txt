NOIDA: As the sanitation workers’ strike entered the tenth day, the RWA federation has offered to take up   collection and cleanliness of residential sectors if the   was willing to pay 70% of the cost of the job from what it pays to its contractors and workers. The Authority is yet to respond to the offer.

 The temporary solution has been mooted during a meeting between Noida Authority officials and RWA members at   office on Friday.
 
 “We told additional CEO P K Agarwal that we are willing to arrange for garbage collection and the cleanliness of residential sectors if Authority is willing to pay 70 % of the cost of the job which it pays to its sanitation contractors and workers. Many sector RWAs are already hiring private vendors and contractors to get their sectors cleaned, from their pockets or monthly collection from residents. We can continue that across Noida if provided the funds,” said N P Singh, president Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA).
 
 According to Singh, it is a plausible and permanent solution to tackle the problem as authority is faced with the recurrent strike from contractual workers.
 
  “As a long-term solution, Noida Authority can assign the said responsibility to us with the provision of 70% of what they have been paying to the contractors. This will not only ease their burden but also get the job done for less than the cost which they currently incur,” said Singh.
 
 The secretary general of FONRWA, A N Dhawan, said: “RWAs and police should provide security to those sanitation employees who are willing to return to work.” He also demanded a permanent solution to the problem by way of requesting transfers of Class IV employees. “Cleanliness is an essential service and needs to be dealt with strictly. Those who don't deliver should be shifted,” said Dhawan.
 
 In the meeting, ACEO Agarwal assured the RWAs of a solution to the problem after consultation with senior Noida Authority officials.
