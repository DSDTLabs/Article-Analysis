Mumbai: State Bank of India expects the   situation to reach normalcy by end-February, given the current trends in supply of bank notes. Although the   is slightly behind schedule in replacing notes, it is expected to print as much as 80-89% of the total currency by end-February.

 According to the RBI data as of December, 44% of the demonetized currency has been replaced.   had earlier estimated that 53% of the demonetized currency would be replaced by the time the notes are fully scrapped.
 
 SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said even Rs 10 lakh crore worth new currency could lead to normalization. However, the problem is that there are not enough currency notes of Rs 500 denomination and lower. In a report released here, the bank’s economic research department said that one possible reason for delay so far could be that the RBI is also printing notes of smaller denominations apart from Rs 500 notes. “If we assume that the RBI continues to print as it is doing now, then by Jan-end, 67% of the currency should get replaced. By February, at this rate, the RBI could print as much as 80-89% of the total currency,” the report said. 
 
 According to the report, even with the value of notes printed at the lower end, the cash shortage would end much sooner than what many fear. “If this is the case, the possibility of GDP bounce back faster than anticipated may not be ruled out. In any case, a lower growth this year will give the government significant advantage next year by allowing it leeway in its budget numbers more in FY18,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist, SBI.
 
 RBI sources said notes of higher denomination take longer to print because of the “raised ink” printing (intaglio). As compared to this, lower denomination notes are produced using offset printing which is a much faster process. Also, the smaller size of the Rs 500 note enables the currency presses to print much more than they would with the earlier size.
