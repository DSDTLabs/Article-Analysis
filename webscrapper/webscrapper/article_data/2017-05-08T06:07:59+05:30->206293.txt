PATNA: The security cover at   in the city would be enhanced in the coming days.
 
  According to sources, around 200 Central   (CISF) personnel are manning the airport terminal building. However, more security personnel are required for proper checking of baggage and passengers as more x-ray baggage scanners would be installed by the   (AAI) soon. The airport is likely to get 75 additional CISF personnel for strengthening the security cover.
  
  CISF commandant at Patna airport, Dharmaveer Yadav, said request for more personnel had been made to the central government. “Within the next few months, additional security forces would get deployed at the airport,” he said.
  
  Sources said there is only one baggage scanner is to be manned by CISF personnel. One more scanner is there, but it is kept on standby to be used only when pressure of flyers increases or the first machine is used for a long period.
  
  “Scanning experts are available only for one machine. The AAI will soon install another baggage scanner. One such machine will be installed at the entrance of the terminal building to be used for random scanning of passenger baggage,” sources said, adding that three more scanners would function at the airport.
  
  Sources said Patna airport, on an average, handles 4,000 flyers daily.
  
  The airport, which falls in the sensitive category in the country, would also have CISF personnel to man the outer periphery. At present, Patna police looks after the security arrangements on the airport’s outer premises.
  
  “Once the   gives its nod for deployment of trained CISF personnel, Patna police will be replaced by us,” said a CISF officer on the condition of anonymity.
  
  He said the deployment of more CISF personnel would make them self-dependent as far as the ‘Counter-Terrorist Contingency Plan’ is concerned as it would end their dependence on the   (ATS) or other commando forces in dealing with emergency situations.
