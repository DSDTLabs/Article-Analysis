NEW DELHI: A   on Saturday directed chief minister   to appear before it next month in a   by   and Chetan Chauhan, while allowing his personal exemption on medical grounds.

 Metropolitan Magistrate Abhilash Malhotra directed the CM to appear on March 21 when it would also hear arguments on point of framing of notice. Meanwhile, it granted bail to suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 and a surety of like amount, saying it was a bailable offence.
 
 Both   and Azad had been summoned as accused on complaint filed by Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) and Chetan Chauhan. 
 
 Azad had argued that the complaint was not maintainable as the high court has appointed retired justice Vikramajit Sen as administrator of the cricketing body. However, the cricketing body had maintained that the complaint was filed last year and hence can be decided.
