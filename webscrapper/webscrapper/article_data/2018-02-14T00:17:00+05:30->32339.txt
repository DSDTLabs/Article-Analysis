Pimpri Chinchwad: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will hold a meeting on Wednesday with BJP leaders, party office-bearers and civic office-bearers from Pimpri Chinchwad in Mumbai

 The meeting assumes significance because of allegations of corruption and irregularities heaped against the civic body by opposition NCP and Shiv Sena as well as some BJP leaders. Giving details of the meeting, BJP’s Eknath Pawar said, “It will be a routine meeting, wherein issues related to the party, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and others will be discussed.”
 
 There is a growing demand from social organisation as well as various political parties to extend Pimpri-Swargate metro route till Nigdi in the first phase. Further, the civic body needs state government’s permission to use waters of Bhama Askhed and Andra dams to meet the growing drinking water needs of the city. Also, the work of Pavana dam-Nigdi water pipeline has been stalled for nearly seven years and needs permission of the state government for restarting so that the city can get additional water for meeting its drinking water needs till the waters of Bhama Askhed and Andra dams are brought to the city.
 
 “BJP is committed to the cause of extension of metro till Nigdi in first phase,” replied Pawar.
