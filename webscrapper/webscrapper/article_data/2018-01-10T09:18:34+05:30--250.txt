LUCKNOW:Assembly Speaker Hridaya Narain   said any bid to create a ruckus in the   by MLAs would not be tolerated. 

 Addressing a press conference in the central hall of Vidhan Bhawan on Tuesday, Dixit said slogan shouting or protests on the spur of the moment in the assembly were acceptable but acts like bringing in banners and placards stealthily and blowing whistles smacked of a conspiracy and a well thought out strategy to disrupt the house. This would invite disciplinary action, he said. 
 
 The Speaker was replying to a question on the opposition's bid to conduct a parallel assembly outside the House and his recent ruling on this controversy.
 
 He said that the founding fathers of the Constitution had clearly laid down rules for protests in the House and on the streets. 
 
 "Street behaviour in the House is unacceptable and the House has to conduct and complete its legislative responsibilities," remarked Dixit, adding that he was confident that members of the assembly were res0ponsible people who would allow the assembly to discharge its duties.
 
 In reply to a question on his decision of banning rampant use of government emblem by former legislators, he said it was an unlawful activity and if the   was opposed to this, it should look into records as one such order was issued by the   government in 2008.
 
 The Speaker said he was satisfied as the agenda of the brief session of the House recently was attained. 
 
 "Nearly 15 bills, including UPCOCA, were tabled and six ordinances replaced with Bills. Despite being a brief session, it was productive," he said. 
 
 "It is also noticeable that members of the Opposition were given more time to express their views than the government," remarked Dixit.
