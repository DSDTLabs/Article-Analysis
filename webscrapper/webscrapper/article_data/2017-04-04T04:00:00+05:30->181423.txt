Surat: Chief minister Vijay Rupani will lay the foundation stone for the rail overbridge at the historic Gandhi Smruti railway station near Navsari and a 12.9km-long coastal road to Dandi on the 87th anniversary of Dandi March on April 6. The National Salt Memorial, which is coming up on 15 acres at Dandi at a cost of Rs 90 crore, will be ready by December. The rail overbridge and the coastal highway will entail expenditures of Rs 36.90 crore and Rs 19.54 crore, respectively and facilitate people visiting the memorial. 

 Sudarshan Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith, is a member of the special committee formed to monitor the memorial project. He said, “The life-size statue of Mahatma Gandhi is ready. The statues of 81 Satyagrahis have also been completed by IIT, Bombay. Work on lighting up the pyramid and library is yet to start. The work on ground has begun. But there is need for better coordination between the central and state governments on this historic project.” 
 
 The tender for the work was awarded to the contractor by Central Public Works Department (CPWD ). “The work for the memorial project will cover 15 acre of land. This is huge tract of land and thus its development will take some time,” said Kalu Danger, a worker from Gujarat Vidyapith’s campus at Dandi. 
 
 Central government’s Green Action for National Dandi Heritage Initiative (GANDHI) and a project of tourism department of Gujarat government are also underway in Dandi. 
 
 Navsari district collector Ravi Arora said, “There would be complete makeover of Dandi thanks to these projects. We will ensure that the projects maintain the deadline.”
