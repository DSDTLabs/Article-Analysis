BHOPAL: Officials of a municipality in Chhindwara district of   have siphoned off more than Rs 1 crore by using forged cheques in 2016. 

 Katni’s former SP   who was transferred to Chhindwara a month ago, has exposed the Rs 1 crore fraud in Harrai municipality of the district.
 
 A case of fraud was registered last year against three officials, including Harrai municipality’s chief municipality officer (CMO)  . A cheque of Rs 7.5 lakh, issued by Harrai municipality, was forged and 2 added before 7 to make it Rs 27.5 lakh. This led to a scam of Rs 20 lakh. Despite the issued cheque bearing signature of municipality chairperson  , she was not named as accused. 
 
 Tiwari reopened the case in January this year. An FIR was also registered against Shah, who is wife of   Kamlesh Shah.
 
 “We have verified records of the municipality as well as the bank. Transactions show that a scam of Rs 1.17 crore by forging cheques took place in 2016. Municipality records show that cheques of Rs 9,000 or Rs 6,000 were duly issued for payment against works. However, these were cashed for Rs 29 lakh or Rs 6 lakh. So far, we have found four cheques that were forged in 2016. Moreover, records of previous years are missing,” Tiwari said. He said that a third party was used to make payments to contractors. The payment due to a contractor was handed over to a middle man who then passed it on to the contractor.
 
 “The middleman will only make payment that was actually due to the contractor while spending the remaining sum of money. Several transactions of a private man transferring funds to municipality officers have been detected,” Tiwari said.
 
 “We are also tracking old transactions carried out by the municipality and investigations are on,” he added.
