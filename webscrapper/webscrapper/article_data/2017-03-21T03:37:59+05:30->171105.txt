NEW DELHI: At a time when electronic voting machines (EVMs) are facing severe scrutiny from AAP and other political parties, a PIL relating to them has reached the Delhi high court.

 Slated to be taken up for hearing later this week, the PIL seeks printing coloured photographs of candidates on ballot papers and EVMs instead of black-and-white photographs as is the current practice.
 
 The petition wants HC to direct   (ECI) and   to start using coloured photos from the upcoming municipal polls.
 
 Filed by two undergraduate students — Anil Kumar and Pratap Chandra — the PIL argues that the Election Commission had issued direction in March 2015 itself that in elections held after May 2015, in addition to the election symbols of the party candidates, their photographs shall also be fixed on the ballot papers and on the EVMs.
 
 It had directed that the candidates shall present their latest coloured or black-and-white photos within three months of nomination, but in all subsequent elections, only black-and-white photographs have been found to be fixed on ballot papers.
 
 “When ECI has sought coloured as well as black-and-white photos from candidates, there should be no reason for affixing black-and-white photos,” the plea argued.
