THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   backed out at the last minute from former vigilance chief Jacob Thomas’s book release on Monday fearing that he might be violating the Official Secrets Act, though those in the know indicated that it had to do more with the book’s supposedly explosive contents.

 Having courted controversy even before its release, Thomas’s autobiography ‘Sravukalkoppam Neenthumbol’ ( ), contains critical remarks against former chief minister   and CPI leader C Divakaran.
 
 According to the official version, Pinarayi’s decision to stay away from the function came after a complaint from MLA, K C Joseph, who said the release of the book, “which is in violation of service rules”, by him will create a public impression that classified information is being revealed with the knowledge of the chief minister. 
 
 “K C Joseph MLA had written to me pointing out that   wrote the book without the permission of the government while he was still in service and the MLA also pointed out that it’s in violation of Official Secrets Act. Following the law secretary’s advice, I decided not to attend,” Pinarayi told reporters adding that legal aspects with regard to the book will be examined.
 
 However, sources close to Thomas said that the book release function was cancelled following intelligence reports hinting at a possible disruption by Congress workers.
