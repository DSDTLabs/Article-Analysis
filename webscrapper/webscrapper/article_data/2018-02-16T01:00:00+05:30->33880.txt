Almost three weeks after he put in his papers, Mukesh Khanna’s resignation — from the post of the Chairman of the  ,   ( ) — has been accepted by the I&B Ministry. The veteran actor, popular as television’s superhero  , has already finalised his plans ahead. 

 He has set up an organisation, Shaktiman's World of Children's Films, and is approaching filmmakers to make movies for children, to which he will lend his brand Shaktiman.
 
 Mukesh says, “What I was expecting has happened. I can’t say if the Ministry would have extended my tenure or if I would have accepted the offer to continue for another three years. They wanted me to work with a sarkari mentality; something I wasn’t in favour of. I wanted the CFSI to become a production house making films for children, who are the future of our nation. I assume they didn’t like my strategy. Maybe, I was moving very fast. When things came to a head, I realised that I will be able to make a difference if I work from outside and not as the chairperson of CFSI. Dil uth gaya mera.”
 
 About his new initiative, the actor elaborates, “I have already been approached by a couple of producers, who have shown interest in backing two films. I would be extending my brand Shaktiman to promote those movies. I hope to make good content for the children of my country.”
