Shimla: In   people are being duped by cyber criminals making international transaction or online shopping using cards of their unsuspecting victims. Witnessing a spurt in number of complaints, state cyber crime police station has asked the people to remain cautious while making online transactions.

 “Nowadays we are receiving lot of complaints from general public about the fraud committed for making international transactions or shopping online,” said DSP Narvir Singh Rathour, in charge of the cyber crime police station at Shimla.
 
 He said that Indian credit card users witnessed fraud as their cards were in their wallet even as purchases were made in foreign country. Generally, customer were not aware about their transaction as they don’t get any OTP (one time password) number during the such transaction. 
 
 He said that in domestic online shopping gateway site send OTP number to the customer. But in international transaction or shopping, customer was not getting any OTP number and thus didn’t even come to know about it immediately. 
 
 He said that to avoid such cases, customer could disable their credit or debit cards for international transaction usage. He said that customers can call toll free numbers mentioned on the their card. 
 
 “We can stop this facility by using internet banking. RBI also has issued guidelines to bankers that all new debit and credit cards issued by banks will allow usage in India only. If the customer wants to carry out international purchase then the cards must have EMV ship embedded and must generate pin. Banks had already put a threshold limit on international usage beyond,” he said. 
 
 He said that by creating awareness among general customer about these changes in debit or credit card facilities only the chances of fraud could be prevented and online transaction could be made safer.
