BENGALURU: In February this year, parents of two boys filed a police complaint in   town,   district, alleging miscreants threw   on the faces of their sons, aged four and 10 years, while they were playing at a ground in the town.

 There were burn marks on the faces of the boys and since the incident began to take communal overtones, police registered a criminal case and launched a hunt for the miscreants. As part of the probe, skin samples taken from the faces of the two boys were sent to a forensic science laboratory.
 
 Now, two months on, the FSL report states the injuries were caused by fire and there was no presence of acid in the samples. Police are now preparing to question the boys again.
 
 In their original statements to police, the boys claimed about seven youth on bicycles entered the ground where they were playing and threw acid on them. They suggested it was the fallout of an incident that occurred a day earlier when a few students fought with the brothers over sharing playing space at the ground.
 
 “Initially, we believed the boys,” police said on Tuesday. “But then doubts grew after an inspection. The gates to the ground were locked since it was a Shivaratri holiday. Bringing a bicycle on to the ground was next to impossible as the ground is fenced.”
