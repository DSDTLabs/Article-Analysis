VADODARA: After ensuring peace in the city during  , the police will now be busy impounding stray cattle on the roads. 

 The police department has formed a separate team of 12 cops to help the   ( ) in tackling stray cattle menace. The civic body that has made several teams to impound stray cattle had sought help from the police some months ago. 
 
 “The team led by a police sub-inspector will move around with the VMC team at the spots where stray cattle is found in more numbers,” Manoj Sashidhar, police commissioner. “VMC had asked for our support earlier but we needed the force during Ganesh festivals,” he added. “The presence of police will also deter cattle owners from attacking VMC’s teams that impound the bovines,” Sashidhar added. 
 
 The police have been providing security to VMC teams as the cattle owners often attack them or try to release the impounded stray cattle. 
 
 Last year, owner of a stray cow that led to a road accident killing a man was arrested. This year, three persons have died in road accidents caused due to stray cattle. The civic body and district collector had in past made attempts to resettle the cattle owners outside the city but the efforts failed.
