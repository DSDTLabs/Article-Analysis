When you think of a turtleneck toy think of a warm, cosy winter outfit. Right? But in a world where the likes of Kardashian-Jenners-Hadids are calling the style shots, the good ol’ turtleneck is anything but that. In 2015, Vera Wang showcased a transparent turtleneck, and since then, the Kardashian klan has made it into their signature style. They wear it for lunch dates over black undergarments, for night outs over pasties and shrobe a jacket when hanging out with friends. But to make it a street style requires the right styling. 

 
 
 Sheer and coy don’t mix. Bollywood costume designers and stylists Divvya and Nidhhi Gambhir say that while doing sheer you have to remember a few things. First, you cannot wear a nude bra under it. Stick to the same colour lingerie. 
 Believe it or not there is a way to make sheer look classy. Divvya lays down the rules: “Never overdo in one look. Layering is the key, which also adds a nice texture.” Wear a smart jacket or experiment with pasties in cool cut-outs. Throw a sheer dress over a slip. A black sheer turtleneck can be easily thrown over a black tank, bralet or a camisole underneath. “It’s a look that can be taken from day to evening,” Nidhi adds. But the duo say a big no to full bandage dresses championed by Kim Kardashian and model Ashley Graham.
