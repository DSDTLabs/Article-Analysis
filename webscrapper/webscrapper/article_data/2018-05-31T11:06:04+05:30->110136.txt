PANAJI: Why not legalise   when   on a bigger scale is permitted at the casinos in the state? Law minister   says it is not just him raising the question but many ask this question. “I feel legalising matka is one of the options and it has to be tried since we can’t end the problem,” said D’Souza.

 
 “We can’t solve the problem, we have failed to address it so far,” said D’Souza, adding since the problem is “beyond us” doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be doing anything about it.
 
 He said questions are repeatedly asked as to why gambling on a big scale is permitted by law at the casinos, but matka is not. 
 
 Sources say people from all sections of the society in the state are involved in matka, including some ex-MLAs. 
 
 The state government need not wait for a central legislation to legalise matka. The state government can do it, said the law minister. 
 
 He said there may be different opinions on the issue, but the government has to find a solution to the problem. D’Souza said the approach towards matka is no different from that of drugs and prostitution.
 
 Goa has not seen much crackdown on matka though it is an open secret that matka dens are operative in every town and small operatives are functional in every village.
 
 “Matka happens everywhere. Do you hear of police conducting searches anywhere?” the law minister asked.
 
 The only time police took some action was about a year and a half ago, when an activist moved high court of Bombay at Goa seeking direction to police to act against matka operatives. The government also constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate “matka gambling” following the petition.
 
 A source said though police conducted some searches after their alleged “in action” vis-à-vis matka came to fore in the high court, the exercise slowly lost momentum.
