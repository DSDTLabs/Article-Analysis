NEW DELHI: India’s largest warship — the 45,400-tonne INS   — will have its own ATM from Saturday to cater to the over 1,500 sailors and 110 officers who serve on board the aircraft carrier.

 The   has tied up with the country’s largest bank, the  , for the ATM that will function with a satellite link on INS Vikramaditya. This comes at a time when people are still queuing outside ATMs around the country after demonetisation.
 
 Though decommissioned aircraft carrier   also had an ATM, it became operational only when the warship was in the harbour. With a satellite link, the ATM on board   will be able to function on the high seas as well, say officers.
 
 INS Vikramaditya was inducted in 2013 under a $2.33 billion deal with Russia.
