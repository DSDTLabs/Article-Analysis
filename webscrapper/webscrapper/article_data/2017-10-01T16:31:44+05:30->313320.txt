Having worked in the industry for more than 15 years,   Tejwani’s participation in controversial reality series   came as shock to many. However, the actor says he took up the show to test himself. 

 “I was supposed to start a project, but that got delayed and now it will start by next year so I had time in hand. When   came my way I thought I should give it a try and that’s the reason I took up the show,” explained Hiten. 
 
 The actor says he is going inside the house without any strategy and will just go with the flow. “I am not going with any plan. I will be just myself. People have loved me as various characters, but now they will get to see how   is in real life. I am just going to be myself,” says the Kyunkii fame actor. 
 
 
 
 
 When asked if he is prepared to stay without his wife   and kids on the show, he said, “It has not sink in yet that I have stay without my kids for so long. I am an actor and I often shoot outdoor where I can’t see my kids, but I have a privilege to talk to them or see them over phone. However, in this case I will not be able to do any of this. My wife was the one who told me to do the show. She said you better win and come or else don’t do the show.”
 
 The actor, who was last seen in Ganga, says he will not be a silent observer if there is a fight in the house. He will react if someone is trying to pick fight unnecessarily. 
 
 “I am very patient in real life. I don’t fight normally, but if someone purposely pokes me, then it becomes difficult for me to control my anger. But that happens once in a blue moon.” 
 
 When asked about a habit of his that can cause problems in the 
  for others, Hiten answered, “My kids tell me that I snore a lot at night, but I don’t believe them. So I am going to use the same tactic in the Bigg Boss house too. If any contestant comes and tells me that I snore I will straight away refuse to believe it (laughs).”
