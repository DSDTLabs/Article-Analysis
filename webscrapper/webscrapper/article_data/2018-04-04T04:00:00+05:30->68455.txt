Chennai: How do car companies fare in terms GST and cess revenue contribution to the government's purse? According to the latest industry data passenger vehicle market leader Maruti tops the GST and cess tax share percentage for the full year FY17-18 at 37.6% followed by Hyundai at 17.4%, M&M at 11.6%, Toyota at 10% , Honda at 7.6% and Tata Motors at 4.4%. While the top 3 companies follow the marketshare pecking order in the list the bottom half is skewed in favour of more premium vehicle sellers whose tax slab is higher. Maruti, Hyundai and M&M are the top 3 passenger vehicle sellers in the country. The next four are Honda, Tata Motors, Renault Nissan/Datsun and Toyota. However when it comes to GST revenue share the order is reversed to Toyota, Honda, Tata Motors, Ford and Renault/Nissan/Datsun (see table). The reason for this rejig is of course the price slab of the vehicles sold. While more mass volume players such as Tata Motors and Renault/Nissan/Datsun have higher volumes their vehicles being more competitively priced are taxed lower. Players such as Toyota and Honda have more premium vehicles and therefore their tax contribution is higher. Cars and SUVs pay the highest GST slab of 28% but attract different cess slabs over and above that. Vehicles that are less than 4 metre attract 1% cess for petrol versions and 3% for diesel. Vehicles that are more than 4 metres attract 15% or 17% or 19% or 22% depending upon their price and category. The premium and luxury SUVs attract the highest cess slab of 22% over and above the GST slab. This is why premium vehicle brands contribute more to the governmentâ€™s tax pool than more mass market brands said a volume car marketer. However this logic does not work with the top three whose market share is big enough to ensure a larger tax contribution as well.
