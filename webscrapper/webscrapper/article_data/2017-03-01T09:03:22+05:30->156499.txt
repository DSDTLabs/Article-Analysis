MANALI: A   has delayed the progress on the digging of the 8.8km-long   at an altitude of more than 10,000ft. The area has experienced 145 avalanches, small and large, in the last two months, an official said.

 While work from north portal of the tunnel remains closed from December to mid May every year due to closure of Rohtang pass, work continues from south portal year-round. This year, approach road to the tunnel from Manali side has been experiencing avalanches after heavy snowfall and vehicular movement on the road is barred between 8am and 5:30pm daily, when chances of avalanches remain very high.
 
 The engineers are facing problem in disposing of the muck as   is situated at   which is why these days it is being dumped near the tunnel. The engineers have just 1,130m more to dig to achieve breakthrough in the tunnel.
 
 Rohtang tunnel project chief engineer Brig D N Bhatt said 145 avalanches have been recorded in Solang, Dhundi and portals of the tunnel since January. “The tunnel excavation is undergoing high stress as we are working below the overburden of 1,100m. We could not achieve good progress in January and February due to poor rock material. If such poor rock material continues in March, the breakthrough in tunnel may be achieved in September instead of July. We shall then speed up final works inside tunnel to meet the target,” he said.
 
 Work on Rohtang tunnel had started on June 28, 2010, with estimated completion time of five years. The geological challenges in construction delayed the work. After breakthrough in the tunnel this year, it will become motorable by 2019.
