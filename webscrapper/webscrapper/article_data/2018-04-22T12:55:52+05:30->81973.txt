The American pop-rock band that enthralled Mumbaikars on their first ever live performance on Saturday night, paid a tribute to the young DJ  , whose sudden demise shocked the   world.

  
  
 As the band appeared on stage thousands of Mumbai music lovers welcomed the five-member band with a huge applause. Having star their performance with 'Stop and Stare', by the lead singer  , the audience and performers shared a very emotional moment when they paid tribute to Avicii with 'Wake Me Up'.

 Interestingly, apart from playing their own songs, the band also performed  's 'Halo',  's 'Happier' and Adele's 'Rumor Has It'.
 
 Tedder, who is not only a vocalist but also a songwriter, flaunted his talent as a pianist as he performed these songs playing the instrument.
 
 Keeping it high energy intact with all-time favourites such as 'Good Life', 'Kids', 'All The Right Moves' and 'If I Lose Myself', the band conquered the stage.
 
 The blistering performance of 'Rumor Has It' then quickly launched into the evening's conclusion of the bass-heavy, dance-inducing 'Love Runs Out'.
 
 Tedder then introduced his bandmates thanked the audience with folded hands and said, "Namaste India, We would not be here without you. We generally plan our tour 6 months in advance but this is the most last-minute tour we have ever planned and we switched venues overnight. It's a total dream come true for us. I wanted to visit India since I was 10."
 
 "Nevertheless the last 3 days have been nothing but sheer magic and nothing can describe the experience we have had in India! Shukriya," he added.
 
 Overwhelmed with the experience in India, Tedder also said that he was looking forward to visiting New Delhi, Jaipur, Goa, Bengaluru and other places in the country.
