Anything can happen inside the   house — friends can become foes and sworn enemies can become bosom pals. Overnight. Considering the highly unpredictable environment inside the house, it’ll be interesting to see how the equation between two participants —   and   — turns out. 

 The two had a bitter and public fallout when Shilpa, who became popular as Angoori bhabhi in ' ', had an unceremonious exit from the show. Vikas, the former programming head of the channel, was instrumental in replacing her. While he blamed her alleged tantrums and unprofessionalism for the ouster, the actress accused him of mental harassment. 
 
 Given the fact that the two have been at loggerheads for over a year, one can expect fireworks on the show.
 
 Meanwhile, Shilpa’s participation on the show was doubtful until recently because of a pending defamation case against her, filed by Cine and TV Artistes’ Association. However, we hear that the actress secured an anticipatory bail in the matter on Wednesday, thus confirming her presence on the show.
 
 While both Shilpa and Vikas didn’t respond to our text messages, a source associated with the project tells us, “Their enmity is known to all, and we are expecting a major showdown on the show.”
