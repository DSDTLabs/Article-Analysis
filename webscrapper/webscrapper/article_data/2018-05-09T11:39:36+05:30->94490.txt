BHOPAL:  's only woman-driven autorickshaw turns pink. Its driver  , 24, has decided to cater to only women in view of the spurt in incidents of crime against women.

 
 Talat, has not been very forthcoming whether she encountered any unsavoury incident, but expressed her apprehension over driving late hours and carrying male passengers anymore.   has been the only woman autodriver in the city making a living out of the male dominated bastion.
 
 “During my initial days, I drove the vehicle during late night hours and picked male passengers without fear,” said Talat, adding, that it was a good experience as people came forward to support her.
 
 To a question why she suddenly decided to carry only females, she said there was no specific incident that happened with her. “But just to be safe and avoid trouble, I have decided to drive auto only for female passengers and restrict my timings from 10 am to 6 pm.”
 
 When asked about challenges, she said, “It’s a bit difficult to drive at night. Also, most of the people in my locality still give me an odd look apart from murmurs about my work.” Talat said she seldom pays any heed to the passes made by her neighbours.
 
 She had left her husband and returned to her parents about almost four years ago. It was only after Gaurvi Action Aid, NGO working for women protection and uplift, invited her for free auto-driving training that she picked up the tricks of trade and obtained a driving license.
 
 A resident of Neelbad, Talat has inspired nine more women to take to driving autorickshaws. “They have applied for driving licences and are waiting,” said Talat. “I have got an offer from tuition class to pick and drop students from their houses. I am soon going to join them, while   coordinators are trying to join us to digital taxi apps to make our work easy.
