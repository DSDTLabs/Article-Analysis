HYDERABAD: Taking a serious view on the delay by Telangana state in furnishing the status of 150 acres at   in Balapur of Ranga Reddy district where a realtor had built 100 villas without permission, the Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday became critical of authorities for not filing a counter, despite a court order nine months ago. RR district collector was also asked to be present in the court if he fails to file a counter in two weeks.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice MSK Jaiswal said this while hearing a public interest petition filed by  , vice-president of Devathalagutta Parirakshana Samithi, which contended that a realtor firm, Pride India, had been putting up constructions without obtaining permissions from the HMDA and Badangpet Nagar Panchayat. The bench earlier stayed all constructions, restrained alienation of land and villas, and also prevented the possibility of any occupancy in these establishments. Following objections from private parties that the petitioner has mixed even the private patta land in the litigation, the bench sought a detailed counter from the T state and its revenue wing to ascertain the status of the land surveynumber wise.
 
 On Tuesday, the bench was told by petitionerâ€™s counsel P S P   that the state is yet to file its counter. The counsel for the private parties sought vacation of the stay. HMDA counsel   told the bench that even if the stay is vacated, the builder cannot raise structures because all of them are illegal. The bench directed collector to furnish the status of the plots in Survey numbers 78 to 90 within two weeks. The bench posted the case for hearing in three weeks
