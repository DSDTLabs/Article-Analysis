LUCKNOW: There is hope now for couples facing recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility.

 Coming to the aid of such couples, an expert of hysteroscopy, Prof  , came to Lucknow all the way from   to hold a two-day awareness and learning sessions with gynaecologists at a city hospital.
 
 Around 100 gynaecologists, including those from government hospitals, were given hands on training in the method that is used to diagnose and treat problems of the uterus.
 
 “Hysteroscopy is an emerging breakthrough in the dark life of infertile couples. It is the best and only tool for direct visualization of uterine cavity,” said Prof Shawki.
 
 Dr Gita Khanna, organising secretary of the workshop said, “It is also a jump ahead of the old method, where we had to hold the cervix and then visualise the uterine cavity. It can be done as an OPD procedure to diagnose cause of unexplained infertility, unexplained bleeding and recurrent miscarriages.”
 
 Prof  , head of gynaecology department at  , said, “Blind procedures need to stop now. Hysterscopy will also end a large number of hysterectomies (surgical removal of uterus).”
 
 Some specific uterine surgeries can be performed with the help of hysteroscope like removing uterine cavity adhesions (that may occur because of infection or post surgery ), division of uterine septa, removal of polyps and myomal bulging into the uterine cavity along with removal of missing intrauterine devices such as copper-T and foreign bodies.
 
 Patients with excessive bleeding during menses can also benefit by laser guided endometrial destruction with the help of hysteroscope.
