Mumbai: After a dismal performance by the   in the BMC elections, the battle between party satraps -- former Union minister Gurudas Kamat and city Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam --seems to be getting uglier. 

 On Saturday, Nirupam told TOI that of the 38 seats for which Kamat had suggested nominees only one managed to win a seat. However, refuting his charges Kamat has said that Nirupam is conveniently trying to take credit for every seat that the party won in the elections, while the blame for the wards lost is being put on him. 
 
 “Nirupam is trying to disrupt my constituency from where almost seven candidates names were changed,” said Kamat. 
 
 ‘Nirupam, on the other hand, said that he had taken full responsibility for the loss of the party in the corporation elections. “However, I feel that at the district level at least those leaders who had suggested candidates should have gone out and campaigned for them. After recommending many candidates these leaders never worked for them,” said Nirupam. 
 
 He added that only some candidates in electoral wards of Jogeshwari and Dindoshi were changed as they were not “appropriate”.
