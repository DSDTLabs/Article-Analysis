UDAIPUR: Two days after hundreds of villagers courted voluntary arrest in support of their 'tehsil' demand for   town, dozens of women climbed on a water tank in the town on Monday in protest. 

 Over 1,000 women gathered near the tank of the   (PHED) and demonstrated by raising slogans for tehsil status.
 
 A few of them climbed up on the tank and refused to get down unless the collector was called to hear them. Before the administration realised what was happening, a large group had got on the tank and sat perched on railings to continue their protest for over an hour. Besides women, youths too climbed up on the tank and shouted slogans. Later, the police came and convinced the protestors to climb down.
 
 The residents of the town have been staging dharnas, processions and 'bandhs' for the last 10 days demanding tehsil status. Recently, the government had granted tehsil status to the adjoining town of Bhinder, angering the villagers. On Sunday, on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, Jain community members too had held a massive dharna on the main street.
 
 "If the government does not listen to our demand, the movement will become more aggressive," villagers warned.
 
 Bhinder and Kanore are two major areas that fall under the   constituency. BJP rebel  , who hails from Bhinder, is the MLA. Singh had always supported Kanore's claim for tehsil status. However, the government's decision to make Bhinder a tehsil came as a rude shock for Kanore residents who have been protesting since.
