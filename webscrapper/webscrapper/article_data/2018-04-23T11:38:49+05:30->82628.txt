LUCKNOW: Managing   at the worst crossings in the city could become slightly easier.

 To streamline traffic and remove bottlenecks, traffic police have decided to revamp 20 crossings which witness long halts during the day and remain choked. The prominent among these high traffic volume crossings are those at Golf Course, 1090 WPL, Lohia Park, Polytechnic, Munshipulia, Khurramnagar and Engineering College.
 
 
 The project is under way and   cameras have already been installed at these crossings. Now, encroachments are being removed, roads are being widened and stoppage points as well as entry and exit points of heavy vehicles are being decided.
 
 IG Lucknow range   told TOI, “Traffic snarls are a chronic problem. We have identified 20 crossings. If results are positive then the plan will be replicated all over the city.”
 
 ASP traffic RS Nim said 64 points causing traffic congestion were identified on the stretch from   crossing. “We have started using road engineering, and are fixing wrong cuts, deciding on stoppage points of e-rickshaws, autorickshaws and buses, entry of heavy vehicles and removing encroachment,” said Nim.
 
 On completion, traffic movement will be videographed for study and any remaining issues will be sorted. The traffic lights at crossings will also be adjusted as per traffic volume.
 
 Around Polytechnic crossing, all kiosks have been removed and four policemen deployed to ensure that no bus and heavy goods carrier blocks traffic, police claimed. Besides, there will be complete ban on entry of heavy vehicles on the stretch during school traffic hours.
