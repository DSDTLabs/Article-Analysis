 had put up a long post extending his support for the actress who was abducted and allegedly raped in a moving car on Friday night. "As a man who has to share the responsibility of a society that bears this shame, I hang my head! But please..the most we can collectively do at this moment..is to respect the guts of this girl," he wrote. 

 
 
 While he has been receiving hundreds of comments congratulating him for supporting the actress, some ask him why he was talking about protecting a woman's self respect when he himself has spewed out misogynistic dialogues in his films. "You yourself said these lines in a film of yours, 'If I deal with you in real, you will be free only after nine months'. All that has a role in the attack which happened against your colleague. It's such ideals which actors like your drive down the throats of young boys that results in assaults like these," write facebook user Divya Divakaran. "Malayalam cinema is ridden with such dialogues. Your proclamations become just acting if you don't realise that you are also part of the crime," she adds.
