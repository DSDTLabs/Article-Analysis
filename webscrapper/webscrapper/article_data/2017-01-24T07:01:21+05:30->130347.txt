CHENNAI: More than 160 people, including 70 policemen, received treatment for injuries at state-run hospitals in the city on Monday after protests against the ban on Jallikattu turned violent.

 At least 70 people, including a police sub-inspector and four police constables, received treatment as outpatients at the Royapettah Government Hospital. Doctors placed at least 15 of them under medical observation before discharge.
 
 The atmosphere was tense at the hospitals, with relatives of the injured venting anger every time an ambulance brought people with injuries for treatment.

 With entire families abusing policemen and sobbing, senior officers called in a battalion with lathis and shields to disperse them.
 
 "We were not protesting but policemen forced their way into our house and attacked me and my husband," said Kousalya, from Rotary Nagar, RK Salai, who was bleeding from an injury to the left arm. Two women were among more than 10 people who doctors treated after 3pm.
 
 Yogeshwar, who suffered injuries to the head and received treatment as an outpatient, said he and his friends were at Marina when the police chased them away.
 
 "We reached Royapettah clock tower and staged a sit-in," he said. "A large posse of policemen surrounded us as we were negotiating with a team of officers. They beat us severely."
