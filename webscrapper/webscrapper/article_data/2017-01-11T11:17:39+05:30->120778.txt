Surat: Diamond traders and manufacturers who declare bankruptcies and then set up new companies to escape debts and indulge in fraudulent activities, beware! 

 A   (TDC) was set up recently to deal with individuals, firms and companies indulging in wrongful trade practices. 
 
 The 21-person TDC has been formed by Gems and   (GJEPC), Bharat Diamond Bourse ( ) and   (MDMA) to govern their members. 
 
 The TDC will have more power to target scams than India’s existing diamond trade organizations and ban members from Mumbai’s Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB), Trade Disciplinary Committee convener   said. 
 
 At present, the GJEPC, the BDB and the MDMA have their own separate arbitration processes. Each organization can only bring its own members to task. In addition, Indian legal system struggles to deal appropriately with ethical breaches in the trade, Kothari claimed. 
 
 This means a trader can often go bust or mislead a bank and then open a new, outwardly clean business and get away unpunished. 
 
 “The idea is to see people don’t go scot free and start a new business as soon as they go bankrupt. The legal system is such that it takes a long time at the moment,” Kothari said. 
 
 The TDC will comprise representatives from the three groups, with at least three or five impartial members chosen to hear each case. Once they have reached a consensus, the verdict will be taken to the rest of the panel for review. As well as bankruptcy and fraud matters, the committee will consider cases of non-disclosure of synthetics, false inscriptions and other ethical breaches.
