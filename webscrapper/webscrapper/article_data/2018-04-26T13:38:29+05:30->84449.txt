COIMBATORE: A day after the video clip showing Bharathiar University professor   receiving money from a person, allegedly for a varsity post, surfaced, he submitted a explanation letter to the convener committee on the issue on Wednesday.

 In the video, Gnanasekaran, head of Tamil department, was seen demanding money from a job aspirant, who could not be identified, and receiving the cash from him. 
 
 “While the issue will be taken up during the vice-chancellors meeting in Chennai on Friday, the professor has submitted a self-explanatory letter,” said a source from the university. 
 
 “He said the video seems to have taken about five years ago when a friend, who had borrowed money from him, was returning it,” the source added.
 
 “The video seems to have been taken out of context by someone, who wanted to tarnish my reputation as I was in the list of candidates for the vice-chancellor post in Thiruvalluvar university,” the letter read. 
 
 However, the university has appraised principal secretary of higher education and convener of the university’s convener committee Sunil Paliwal about the situation. 
 
 “We have gathered the media reports along with the video clip and passed them to Paliwal. We are waiting for his response,” said a source from the university syndicate.
 
 Meanwhile, state president of   (TNGCTA) T Veeramani has demanded a probe into the allegations. “The action should be taken not just against those who get bribe, but also against the person who give bribe,” he said.
