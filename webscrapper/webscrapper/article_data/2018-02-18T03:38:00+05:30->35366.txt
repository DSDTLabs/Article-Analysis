Vijayawada: In view of the increasing number of   case in the city, opposition parties are gearing for an agitation demanding stringent action against the culprits. A committee, led by Communist Party of India’s city unit secretary, Donepudi Shankar, is working to to intensify the protests.

 Land became a prized possession after the city became a part of the state’s capital region. Shankar said land grabbers are eyeing valuable government land in the city.
 
  “Involvement of a few ruling party leaders is helping the culprits escape legal action, and recent case of land grabbing at SRR & CVR Government College, is a prime example,” he said.
 
 Kolanukonda Sivaji, spokesperson of the Congress in Andhra Pradesh, said, “For almost 10 days we have been complaining about the encroachment of land belonging to SRR college, and no action has been initiated till date. We suspect a highly influential person is behind it.” 
 
 “Telugu Desam Party leaders are directly involved in land grabbing, and they are even targeting lands given to freedom fighters who fought for the nation,” he said. 
 
 “Many recent incidents have proved the role of ruling party legislators, and there was no response from the ruling party,” Sivaji said.
 
 Shankar said, “We have proposed a meeting with Krishna district   B Lakshmikantham, and city police commissioner D Gautam Sawang, on Saturday, and will request them to take stringent action against the land grabbers. The district collector had asked us to meet on February 20.” We will intensify our agitations if they fail to take action on the land grabbers, he added.
