 Speaking to TOI, the groom’s grandfather said that he was on the ground floor when he suddenly heard the main door of the house being opened. “When I went out to check, a few men who seemed to be in an intoxicated state pushed me aside and went towards the first floor, where some women were dancing. When I asked them to leave our house, they called their friends,” he said. The groom was hurt in the incident.
 
 Police officers say that by late evening, the markets in area had opened and people were carrying out their usual business.
