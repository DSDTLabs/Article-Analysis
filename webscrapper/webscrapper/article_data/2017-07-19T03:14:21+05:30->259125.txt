NEW DELHI: His childhood dream was to be a   officer, but after failing to realise it this 27-year-old man decided to impersonate one. His two-year stint of living his dream came to an end after he was arrested from northwest   while trying to extort money from a shopkeeper.

 The imposter, Vikram Singh, worked as a CISF constable in Rajasthan for three years. After his work hours, he used to don a fake CBI jacket and flash a forged ID to obtain favours. He would stay away from areas frequented by his colleagues. However, one day he was spotted   as an ACP in CBI by a co-worker, who informed senior officers.
 
 An inquiry was set up and Singh lost his job after the claims were found to be true. Two cases of impersonation were found registered against him, one in Jaipur (2014) and the other in Bikaner (2013).
 
 After getting dismissed from service, Singh shifted his base to Delhi and started preparing for the civil services. “After coming to know about his suspicious activities, a team led by ACP Model Town Hukma Ram Jat and Mukherjee Nagar SHO Anil Kumar Chauhan kept a close watch on him and later nabbed him red-handed,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Singh told the cops that he had cleared the civil services exam, which was found true after verifying his roll number. “However, he was not appointed due to his criminal record. He has played lawn tennis at the zonal level. The men in his family are Indian Army officers,” said an officer.
 
 When someone would ask about his family, Singh would say that he lived with his wife, a DCP with Delhi Police. The accused used to call senior police and CISF officers and ask them to pass transfer orders. 
 
 Asked how he survived for the past two years, Singh said, “I never paid anyone. No one would question me fearing that I was at a powerful position.”
