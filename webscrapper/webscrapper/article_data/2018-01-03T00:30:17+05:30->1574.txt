Tirupur: The opposition parties on Tuesday created a ruckus at an all-party consultation meeting held in the city on re-delimitation of wards for the upcoming local body election. They alleged that the delimitation was carried out in favour of AIADMK. 

 When district president of Congress P Gopi said the opposition parties were having concern over irregularities and discrepancies in the delimitation process, AIADMK members raised their voice saying that it was unfair to blame their party.
 
 Earlier, the state election commission ordered delimitation of the local bodies across all the districts. To get feedback from the political parties, the district administration conducted the meeting at the collectorate. 
 
 The opposition parties, including the DMK, Congress, CPM, CPI and the BJP, said neither the district administration nor the corporation informed them about the delimitation process. They alleged that the AIADMK members were informed in advance. Moreover, seven days for feedback, which ended on Tuesday, were insufficient, they said.
 
 “The re-delimitation was done in consultation with the AIADMK in each ward to favour its candidates for the upcoming local body poll. If the process was carried out based on the population for better administration, then why the areas were swapped between the neighbouring wards unnecessarily,” said M Nandagopal, a DMK functionary.
 
 On the other hand, AIADMK functionaries said they too have issues with the delimitation. “The proposed draft might lead to better administration but people were not consulted in the process,” said S Selvaraj, an AIADMK functionary.
 
 District collector K S Palanisamy asked the parties to give their feedback, if any, at panchayat-wise and corporation-wise meetings to be held on Wednesday.
