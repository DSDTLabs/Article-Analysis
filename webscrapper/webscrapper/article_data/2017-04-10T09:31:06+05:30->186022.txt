MUMBAI: A woman from Naigaon, Vernesha Rodrigues (40), fended off an armed man who was allegedly trying to steal water meters made of copper from the terrace of her building around 4.30 pm on Friday. 

 The alleged thief,   (38), who claims to be a real estate agent from Vasai (west) was chased and caught by residents of the building after Rodrigues raised an alarm.
 
 Rodrigues who lives on the ground floor of the two-storey building had walked up to the terrace after noticing leakage in one of the water pipes.
 
 At the entrance itself, she found the lock broken. When she reached the terrace, she was shocked to find   unscrewing the copper meters. There were 22 such meters, one for each flat. It later turned out he had uninstalled eight meters. Each meter costs Rs 1,500.
 
 "As soon as the robber saw me, he lunged towards me, a chopper in hand. Though he is on the hefty side, I pushed him away with all my might in such a way that the weapon did not hurt me," said Rodrigues who ran out and locked the two doors to the terrace from outside and rushed downstairs.
 
 While other residents rushed upstairs, a few children playing in the building compound saw the man climbing down the wall. "The kids alerted us and we chased the thief and nabbed him a few buildings away," said Rodrigues. She said Kerekar could barely run after having scaled the wall of the building.
 
 Rodrigues said that Kerekar pleaded to be let off. "He even agreed to pay us the money to re-fix the meters."
 
 In his hurry to escape from the terrace, Kerekar left behind his bag containing tools to pull out the meters. 
 
 After nabbing Kerekar, the building residents took away his wallet and cellphone before calling up the police.
 
  Kerekar told the police that he is a real estate broker but made quick money by selling copper water meters and taps.
