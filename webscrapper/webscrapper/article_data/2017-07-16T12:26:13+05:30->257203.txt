BHUBANESWAR: Isolated yet unrelenting heavy rains since Friday evening resulted in severe waterlogging in several parts of the city on Saturday, causing the capital city to come to a standstill with heavy traffic congestions in almost all the major roads.

 Through Saturday, Bhubaneswar   ( ) workers scurried across the city in an effort to clear water logged areas, a day after it announced a host of steps to address issues arising out of the sustained rainfall. The 24x7 control room that had been opened for the monsoon, received 24 calls in the 36 hours before the filling of the report. Nine dewatering pumps and a few excavators have been engaged to clear water from low-lying areas in the city. The city recorded 35.2 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours in a deluge that ended at 8.30 am on Saturday morning. 
 
 City folk, who were delayed either by traffic jams or by knee deep waters especially in the Bhairavi Vihar, Siddhi Vihar, Jagamara, Paika Nagar, Unit 9 and   areasm were naturally unhappy. "Every year, the BMC makes assurances us that there will be no waterlogging but one spell of heavy rain and all promises and arrangements go in vain," said  , a resident of the   area. 
 
 BMC authorities, however, blamed dumping of solid waste in drains as the prime reason that led to choking of channels that could otherwise have ensured smooth flow of rainwater and kept the streets free of water logging.
