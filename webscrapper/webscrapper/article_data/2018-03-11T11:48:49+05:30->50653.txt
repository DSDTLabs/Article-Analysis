PUNE: Bharat  , a 28-year-old budding hotelier, ended his life after his business partners cheated him of Rs 75 lakh.

  His body was found in his apartment in Bavdhan on March 5. Hinjewadi police booked the two partners for abetting suicide after Balasaheb, Dheringe’s 50-year-old father, lodged a complaint on Friday
 
 According to the first information report (FIR), Dheringe had hanged himself in his apartment and had left a suicide note behind.
 
 Originally from  , Dheringe had moved to Pune only two years ago. In Nashik, he was involved in land dealings. When he shifted to Pune, he came in contact with one of the suspects, who asked him to look after a hotel located in the Deccan area. The suspect had even convinced Dheringe to renovate the hotel in a bid to attract more business. Dheringe duly spent about Rs 30 lakh of his own money to renovate the property. However, two months ago, the contract between the suspect and Dheringe lapsed. Another man then demanded the hotel on lease from the suspect.
 
 Following this, Dheringe went into depression as he had invested heavily in the hotel and was yet to recover the money, police said. Dheringe tried talking to the hotel owner and its new operator, requesting them to resolve the issue of his investment in the hotel. However, the two refused to acknowledge his demands.
 
 Before ending his life, Dheringe left a suicide note describing the business deals with the two men and how they “fooled him.” He also talked of his financial losses in the hotel business.
 
 Based on the suicide note, his father Balasaheb Dheringe, a farmer from Nashik, lodged a complaint with the Hinjewadi police station.
