AHMEDABAD: The state government appears to be in a fix over the stalemate between the management of several schools and the parents' associations about the paying of fees according to the   fixed by the government. 

 The state education department throughout on Thursday held a series of meetings, first with the officials and later with chief minister   to work out a solution to the ongoing impasse.
 
 Sources in the education department said that the department was confident that it would be able to persuade the management to charge the upper limit fixed by the government and take an undertaking that they would pay the difference, if any, in the next academic session.
 
 The bill, which has been cleared, covers all private self-financed schools affiliated with the state education board, ICSE, CBSE or IB in the state, and fixes the upper limit for fees for primary schools at Rs 15,000, secondary schools at Rs 25,000 and higher secondary schools at Rs 27,000 applicable from academic year 2017-18. The government had also intended to hurry up the process so that the fees could be fixed before the commencement of the academic year for the schools affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher   Board and before the second quarters began for the schools affiliated with the   (CBSE). The CBSE schools commence their academic session from April.
 
 The officials said that the government also thought that it would be able to persuade the parents to pay the old fees for the first and the second quarter and would take an undertaking from the school that the fee would be refunded to the parents when the fee committee fixed the same.
