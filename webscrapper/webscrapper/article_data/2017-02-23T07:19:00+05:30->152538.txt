Ludhiana: The fee committee appointed by the high court has directed Bal Bharti Public School to pay more than Rs 6 crore to parents of students for hiking fees in excess of the amount mentioned by the committee and supported by the high court. The school has been increasing tuition fee and annual charges by more than 10%. 

 Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered the school to refund the money charged at the time of admission from 2012 till now. According to the fee committee, any school can charge Rs 2,500 and add 10% every year but Bal Bharti Public School has been adding 20% extra in their fee structure.
 
 According to a parent, they have to pay Rs 50,000 as admission charges at the time of admission and till last year, they had to buy books only from the book shop recommended by the school. On January 23, parents submitted a copy of the petition to DC Ravi Bhagat but they did not get relief. If no action is taken, parents said they would file a contempt of court petition against the school.
 
 "The fee commission has given a verdict in our favor but the school has not replied. If they keep doing this, we will file a contempt of court petition against the school," said Inderpal Singh Chawla, parent of a school student.
 
 "The school is basically a Delhi franchise. They used to get admissions easily in the initial days and after some time, they started increasing the fee. However, facilities provided were sub-standard. On an average, they increase the fee by 20% every year. According to the Fee Commission, they are allowed to raise fee by only 10%. The school has strong political support, which is why they do not even listen to the verdict of the Fee Commission supported by the high court," said Ritu Jain, parent of a school student. School principal Poonam Dogra was not available for comments despite repeated attempts.
