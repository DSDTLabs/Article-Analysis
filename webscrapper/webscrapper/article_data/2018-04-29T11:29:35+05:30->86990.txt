CHENNAI: A group of naturalists that visited the Pulicat lake on the city's outskirts on Friday was caught unawares with a rare sight - the lesser noddy, a pelagic , or seabird, frolicking on the water body. This is the first time the bird has been spotted so near the city. 

 Sharing details of the encounter with TOI, the founder of Nature Trust, K V R K  , said that way back in 1986, the   in  , and 27 years later, once in 2013 in Kanyakumari and in 2017 along the coast. 
 
 Called 'Aala' in Tamil, the bird belongs to the tern family. Lesser noddy (Anous tenuirostris) was sighted by Thirunaranan's team along with a group of greater crested terns, lesser crested terns, brown-headed gulls and little terns. 
 
 "Nearly 500 of them were on the coast and this bird was found sitting alone, a little away from the other birds. But we couldn't click pictures of it," he said. 
 
  said that seabirds rarely come inland or nest on the shores. They stay on flight as much as they can, and rest on sand dunes found mid-sea and nest on islands, he explained.
 
 The Pulicat bird sanctuary, of late, is attracting a lot of rare species of birds, which could be an indicator of an healthier ecosystem in the backwaters of Pulicat.
