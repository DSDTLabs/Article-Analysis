HYDERABAD: A student from JNTU died and her friend, who suffered severe burns, is battling for life after locals found them in flames in a room in   on Friday evening. The room was locked from inside and there was no suicide note. Both hail from   in Medak. 

 Samyukta, a final year BTech student of JNTU (Kukatpally), died on the spot, while her friend Abhilash (25), also a B Tech graduate, has been admitted to Gandhi Hospital. 
 
 Abhilash had recently undergone a kidney transplant and had come to the city on Thursday for physiotherapy. As he could not return home, he went to a friend's room at   in Musheerabad. 
 
 On Friday afternoon Abhilash's friend and room-mates, who are preparing for competitive exams, went to a local library. "At 5pm locals heard screams from the room and saw smoke coming out. Three locals broke the door latch, but by that time the woman, later identified as Samyukta, had died," Central Zone   D Joel Davis told TOI.
 
 Abhilash's friend and his roommates told police that they were not sure when Samyukta came to the room. "There was no suicide note and the victims may have set themselves ablaze using some inflammable chemical. We are not yet certain about the reasons," the DCP said, adding that family members of the victims have been informed about the incident.
 
 "We are waiting for the statements of the family members to proceed further," the DCP said.
