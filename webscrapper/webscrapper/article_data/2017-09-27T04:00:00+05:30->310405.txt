Surat: The city has a population of over 50 lakh and approximately 26 lakh vehicles, but a directionless parking policy. 

 Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials had held wide-ranging consultations with private transport owners, traders, residents, as well as RTO and police authorities to draft the parking policy. However, what the SMC standing committee recently passed was its watered-down version which shows that the ruling BJP dispensation doesn’t care too much about traffic management. This is why traffic chaos is an everyday occurrence on the 2,200km long roads of the city. “We had proposed production of proof of parking space by a resident before he or she buys a four-wheeler. The idea was to inculcate an attitude of responsibility in people,” said a civic officer. 
 
 “The levying of charges on entry of cargo vehicles on city roads during daytime was to check traffic snarls at places like textile markets,” said another civic officer. 
 
 “The draft policy was perfect except for the fact that user charges or parking charges were on the higher side. However, the ruling BJP did not want to take any risk with assembly elections round the corner and got the draft parking policy amended. The political class should have adopted a mature approach for betterment of urban life in Surat which is on the verge of becoming a metro city,” said an officer of SMC’s town-planning department.
 
 Former chairman of the standing committee Nirav Shahsaid: “The charges and penalties suggested were very high. We wanted to take a practical approach and thus amended some clauses. There was no political motive and it is wrong to say the draft was amended by us in view of the upcoming assembly elections.”
