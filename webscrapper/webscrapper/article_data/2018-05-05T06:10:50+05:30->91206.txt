NEW DELHI: Private equity investments in   sector surged 15% to Rs 16,530 crore ($2.6 billion) during the first quarter of 2018, eclipsing the inflows in the first quarters of last 11 years, according to a report by the global real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield. Only the December quarter of 2017 attracted higher PE investments at Rs 17,100 crore.

 
 Private equity inflows into the residential sector more than doubled to Rs 8,518 crore in Q1, 2018, compared to same period last year, which is also the highest in last 10 quarters. The report attributed the surge in investor activity to government incentives in affordable housing. Mumbai accounted for approximately 19% of the total deals in the residential sector.
 
 Anshul Jain, MD of Cushman and  , said the strong inflows are a testimony to the attractiveness of the Indian real estate market for institutional investors. He said inflows into the realty sector may continue to rise over the next few years.
 
 During Q1, 2018, office sector recorded PE inflows of Rs 6,100 crore ($940 million), a 40% decline from the corresponding quarter last year. The sharp fall in investments is due to the postponement of closure of certain notable transactions to forthcoming quarters, said the report.
