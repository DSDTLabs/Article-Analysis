AHMEDABAD: When a team of   (AFES) found body of a youth in early twenties from near  , they were surprised. The reason was a tattoo on the youth’s right hand reading ‘Chiku’.

  “It was the second body in three days bearing the same tattoo. We had fished out body of a girl in the same age group with the same tattoo from near Vasna Barrage. It was too much a coincidence. The subsequent investigation indeed proved that both of them were related. Till Sunday, the girl’s identity could not be established,” said an AFES official.
 
 According to Riverfront (W) police, they found identity cards and a suicide note from the youth which cleared the case. “He is identified as Prashant Parmar, 22, a resident of   in Bapunagar. We approached his family when we got to know that he was an ITI diploma holder in automobiles and was associated with a fabrication unit in Soni ni Chali area. He had left home on January 25 stating that he was going for an interview,” said an investigator.
 
 The inquiries also identified the girl as Asha Kantibhai, a resident of Jantanagar, Odhav, living for past few months in Parmar’s colony. When Parmar’s family started search for him, Asha’s mother told them that her daughter was also missing.
 
 “The note found on Parmar mentions that they had lost hope of getting married as community came in the way and they had no other option but to end lives. He has also wished that they could not be together in this life but their pyres be prepared together,” said an official, adding that they are yet to ascertain meaning of ‘Chiku’ for the duo.
