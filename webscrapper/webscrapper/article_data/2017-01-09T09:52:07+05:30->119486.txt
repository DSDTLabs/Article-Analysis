KOLKATA:   Pawan Kumar Ruia was sent back to CID custody by a   on Sunday. The investigating agency had sought his custody in one of the cases of theft on the   premises two years ago. 

 Ruia, 59, was produced in court after he served 14 days in judicial custody in a case of fire inside the factory last year. His lawyers prayed for his bail, but the agency tagged him in the theft case and sought his custody for 14 days. 
 
 The magistrate, however, granted them only two days' custody. He will next be produced in court on Tuesday.
 
 CID sources said that on Tuesday, they will seek an extension of custody, tagging him in a separate case of theft at the Dunlop factory site.
 
 Ruia, arrested by the CID from his New Delhi residence on December 11, was initially booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant). When he was produced in court, fresh charges under IPC 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) were slapped on him.
 
 The railways had filed an FIR with the Dum Dum police station after an inspection team found several equipment and coaches - worth Rs 50 crore - missing from the Jessop factory at Dum Dum where a fire had broken out on October 17.
