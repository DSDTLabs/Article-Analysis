 On September 23, 1918 during the First World War, the royal armies of Jodhpur, Mysore and Hyderabad, wherein Hyderabad was kept in reserve with Jodhpur and Mysore lancers charging the attack, had unleashed a mighty attack on the Haifa town, which was under the rule of Turkey for 450 years.
 
 In a matter of one hour, the soldiers of the lancers (cavalry regiments) of these three princely states trounced the Turkish army and got Haifa liberated. In a dreaded fight, Jodhpur Lancers had lost eight soldiers and 60 horses.
 
 Jodhpur Lancers was a cavalry and was set up by the name of the then ruler Sardar Singh under the name of “Sardar Risala” and had comprised selective soldiers.
 
 In 2007, some Israeli tourists came to Jodhpur and during the visit of the Umaid Bhawan Palace, they were told about the Jodhpur royal’s link with the Haifa war. With the adequate information, they went back to Israel and this visit was followed by efforts to set up a war memorial in Haifa. During his Israel visit July last year, Prime Minister   had visited this war memorial.
