 “We started the construction at night and could finish half the work by 6.30 am on Saturday. KSEB officialsmonitored the work throughout the night. We separated each cable from the bunch and shifted them to the shoulder of the road outside the drain,” an official with KMRL said. “We plan to continue the work on Saturday night provided the KSEB officials are there to monitor relocation of cables,” the official said.
 
 Once the work on the drain across Deshabhimani Road is over, it would connect the drains towards Palarivattom and   sides. “There have been severe waterlogging in the area in the past. The flow of storm water from Kaloor side would be cut off as the drain breaks abruptly at Deshabhimani Jn. The water would overflow from the drain and the area would be floodedduring heavy rain,” said P M Harris, chairman, works standing committee, Kochi corporation.
