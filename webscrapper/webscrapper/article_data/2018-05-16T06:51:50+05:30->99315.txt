HYDERABAD: Free parking arrangements are being made by   (HTP) at several spots in   for revellers, ahead of the busy   season.

 
 While two large parking spaces will be provided for free at the demolished bus stand and the Pension office in Charminar, traffic cops have also identified several busy ‘congregation’ points in the city and will provide free parking near these mosques and function halls for the convenience of devotees and to prevent traffic congestion on roads, said top traffic cops.
 
 “While we have already made arrangements for free parking near Mecca Masjid, Yakutpura function hall and  , where huge crowds come to offer prayers, we are looking to make similar arrangements in   as well,” said DCP (Traffic) K Babu Rao.
 
 Rao said the major concern is the encroachment of road space by temporary establishments and vendors. Such issues were discussed during a traffic management meeting held recently between   traffic police officials and footpath vendors and hoteliers from the Old City. Residents, vendors and business owners in the Old City have been asked to coordinate and cooperate with the traffic police to ensure that there are no snarls.
 
 “Roadside fruit shops are amajor concern during Ramzan—several temporary fruit markets spring up in different areas along the roads and by lanes, especially during iftar. We have already counselled several roadside vendors and temporary businesses about traffic management and how to set up their shops to ensure minimum interference to traffic. On Wednesday, similar instructions will be issued to fruit market vendors to not encroach upon the road space,” said Rao.
 
 No traffic movement will be permitted at the ongoing Charminar Pedestrian project site, added traffic cops.
