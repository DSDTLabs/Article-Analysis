BENGALURU:   and JD(S) leader  , who waded in to help disgruntled drivers of Uber and Ola, seems to be having second thoughts about lending his name or initials to the new taxi aggregator company the cabbies are floating.

 Though taxi drivers have zeroed in on the name ‘HDK Cabs’ for the new company scheduled to start operations in April, Kumaraswamy on Tuesday told TOI: “I’m not keen on my name being used for the taxi company.” 
 
 Referring to reports that he was showing interest in taxi drivers with an eye on their votes, Kumaraswamy said: “I genuinely want to help taxi drivers as a majority of them are from rural areas and poor families. But I don’t want people to look at that through a political prism and end up with a distorted image.”
 
 Kumaraswamy had extended support to the taxi drivers’ agitation in Bengaluru last month after the state government refused to intervene in the deadlock between drivers and aggregators over several issues including dynamic pricing and working conditions. The new app-based platform called   was supposed to commence post-Ugadi and run on a cooperative model by drivers themselves. The drivers’ union had claimed that at least 10,000 drivers would be part of the new company.
 
 A source explained: “Naming a taxi company after Kumaraswamy may cause him damage in the long run. The existing aggregators have drawn a lot of flak for sexual assaults and misbehaviour committed by their drivers and the brands have suffered. We don’t want Kumaraswamy’s image to be tarnished because of a crime committed by an unscrupulous driver. The political risk outweighs the gains.”
