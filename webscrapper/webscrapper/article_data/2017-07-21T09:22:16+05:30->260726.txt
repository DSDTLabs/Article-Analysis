 “We were at the KJ Hostel when we heard the din outside and went out to find a seemingly endless queue of vehicles. We quickly realized the traffic chaos couldn’t be controlled just by traffic personnel, and we decided to do our bit,” said Rachi Talwadia.
 
 Talwadia along with Ritik Jain, Binay Jain, Sanskar Jain, Virag Gandhi and  , all CA or CS aspirants and in the age group 17 to 19 years, stood at the Swastik crossroads and later at Navrangpura rossroads from 6.30 pm to 9 pm till the traffic returned to normaCcy.
 
 Ritik Jain said that it was first such experience for them. “While most were appreciative of our work and obeyed the directions, many decided just to get on their way without thinking about how it added to the problem already at hand,” he said.
