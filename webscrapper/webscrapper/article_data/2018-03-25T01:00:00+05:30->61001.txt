Actor  , who has featured in shows like ' ' and ' ', was arrested on November 22, 2017, after a 23-year-old model accused him of rape. Six days later, he was sent to judicial custody for 24 days. From living in a 2BHK flat in Andheri to sharing a cell with 250 hardened convicts in   is an experience the actor will never be able to shake off. The actor finally secured bail on December 21. 

 He spoke exclusively to BT about his time behind bars and how he is looking forward to getting back to work. He said, “Once I started getting calls for work, I realised ki main jo soch raha tha ki log mujhe kis nazar se dekhenge, waisa kuch tha hi nahi. I am working on myself again. I want to thank all those who supported me. Most people who spend time inside jail turn bitter and come out with a vow to seek revenge. I could have either turned that or remained positive. I decided to be the latter.” 
 
 On the work front, Piyush says, “I have played challenging characters and I am looking forward to similar roles. I want people to view me as a talented actor who can pull off performance-oriented roles.”
 
 Talking about his family’s reaction to seeing him incarcerated, he says, “When you go to jail, you don’t go alone. It’s almost like the whole family is going in with you. My brother (actor Girish Sahdev) and father visited me once. They had to stand in the queue from 8 am for four hours to be able to meet me.” 
 
 When asked if his life has resumed normalcy, he replied, “I am glad I have such a supportive family and friends who took care of me after I came back. I practised chants and meditation in jail, and that has helped me a lot now that I’m back to work.”
