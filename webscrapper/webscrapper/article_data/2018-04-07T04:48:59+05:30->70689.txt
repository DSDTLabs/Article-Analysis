MUMBAI: What freebies can you get with a  ? If you're a criminal, you can be served a   as this mother-daughter duo discovered recently. 

  A non-bailable warrant had been issued against the two in a cheating case. And the Economic Offences Wing ( ) was hot on their heels for a while after they repeatedly failed to turn up in court.
 
  However, a   posted on social media by the daughter's husband helped investigators track them down.
 
 "The daughter's husband was very active on social media and would keep putting up food-related posts. We found he had posted a pizza bill which showed his address as Talab, Pune. Our team reached the pizza outlet nearby and learnt the bill was issued in December 2017. Inquiries led us to the house of the accused's sister," said police sub-inspector  , who led the investigating team.
 
 The woman told police her mother and sister had shifted from Mumbai to Pune. Once they got the address of the accused, the police landed up at their residence within minutes and hauled them to court. Hearing in the case is on Monday.
 
 In yet another unusual method employed to track down an accused, police learnt he had moved to another state for treatment of a heart ailment. The team went from clinic to clinic and ultimately got lucky.
 
 The EOW, which deals with white collar crimes in the city and investigates cases where the cheating amount exceeds over Rs 3 crore, has now assigned the job of executing NBWs to its teams.
 
 An NBW is issued by the court if the accused does not attend court or jumps bail. Of the 238 NBWs which the team has to execute, over 55 have already been executed in the past three weeks. The entire operation is being supervised by Ashutosh Dumbre, joint commissioner of police (EOW).
