The event saw students set up stalls and sell homemade products. The visitors too came out whole-heartedly to munch on the eatables and support the cause. The profits generated were directed towards the welfare of the martyr’s families.
One of the organizers said, “We work towards the dual goal of raising awareness about the efforts of armed forces and caring for their families. The idea behind the event is to bring to light the sacrifices of these men, to remember them and to awaken the spirit of patriotism among the students and our fellow countrymen.”
