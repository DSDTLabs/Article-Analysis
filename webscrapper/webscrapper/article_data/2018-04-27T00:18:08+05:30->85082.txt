Coimbatore: Days after several coconut farmers were arrested on charges of tapping neera without obtaining due permission, a large group of farmers filed a petition to the west zone inspector general of police, urging him to stop police from acting arbitrarily against farmers. The farmers alleged that several of them were arrested in the last two months, both in Tirrupur and Coimbatore districts on charges of tapping meera without permission. Police have been threatening to arrest the farmers under the goondas Act, district president of Katchi Saarbatra Tamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam AS Babu said. Explaining that the state government allowed neera tapping a few months back, but with lot of impractical restrictions, Babu said that as per the rules, individual farmers could not tap neera as it requires a processing unit to prevent it from converting into toddy. “It is a big investment for the farmers and they can not afford it. We have been tapping neera ever since the state government approved tapping it. But, we cannot prevent it from converting it to toddy as it is a natural process,” he added. A few days back, more than 200 farmers staged a protest at Tirupur collectorate condemning the police action. They also demanded the government to allow toddy tapping.  Babu said that it was not feasible to tap neera from coconut trees unless toddy tapping is allowed.
