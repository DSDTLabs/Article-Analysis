MUMBAI: A contractor who had been issued   last month for his alleged involvment in the 2014  , has now been awarded   by the civic body. 

 While sources in the BMC said it has revoked the contractor’s show-cause notice because it was sent by mistake, Samajwadi Party corporators raised a stink over the issue.   in BMC and standing committee member Rais Shaikh said, “It’s surprising BMC changed its stance without any justified reason.” 
 
 Chief engineer (roads) Sanjay Darade was unavailable for a comment on Wednesday.
 
 In 2014, an e-tendering scam relating to minor works, includ-ing drainage pipe repairs, came to light. Discrepancies were fou-nd in nine wards where engineers would block SAP system to prevent other parties from filing bids, and then activate it at odd hours, often at night, so that preferred   could file tenders. At least 23 civic engineers were found to be involved in the scam and nine were suspended. 
 
 A civic official said, “In March, show-cause notices were issued to all contractors instead of those found guilty in the e-tendering scam.” As the number of errant contractors could not be ascertained, a committee suggested revoking notices that were sent by mistake, he confirmed. At least three notices were revoked by local ward officials, said sources.
