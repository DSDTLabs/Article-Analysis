  Many women had travelled from various parts of NCR, including Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, to participate in the run. Nitisha Singh, a Faridabad resident who ran the 10km, said, "This run promotes a healthy lifestyle and talks about issues like breast cancer that a lot of women face because they are unaware. So anything I can do for that, I will." Many runners travelled in large groups and ran together. Richa Kalra of Gurgaon-based running group Fitness Ki Paathshala, said, "About 100 of us started from Gurgaon at 4am in two buses and we all ran together in the 10k run. It was great fun although reaching the venue was tough because of the route diversions and jams We had to walk the last kilometrer and a half to reach the stadium." Among the 10,000 odd runners was 101-year-old Mann Kaur, the oldest runner in fray. She said, "I just want to tell everyone here that you are never too old to run, and when it is for a cause, everyone should do this."
