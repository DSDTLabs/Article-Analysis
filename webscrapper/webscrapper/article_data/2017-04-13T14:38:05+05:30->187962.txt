 Later, Saxena waited for an year for the interest but she never got the invested amount. She tried to contact the Fugwanis but they ignored her calls. Saxena also visited the city for the cash.
 
 When Saxena’s all attempts were failed, she approached Pachpaoli police station to lodge the complaint of fraud. The case has been transferred to Economic Offence Wing.
