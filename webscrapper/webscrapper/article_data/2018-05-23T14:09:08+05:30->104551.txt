LUDHIANA: A 21-year-old migrant labourer,  , died on Tuesday morning after he was attacked by a bike-borne snatcher late on Monday evening in Kanganwal of Sahnewal. The accused tried to snatch a mobile from Ravi and his brother Abhishek, who were attacked by sharp-edged weapons when they tried to resist. Though the brothers foiled the snatching bid, they suffered injuries.

 
 On Monday night, Ravi and Abhishek (23) — who work in the same factory as labourers — were returning home. When they were nearing  , two bike-borne miscreants struck at them. Abhishek narrated: “The accused tried to snatch my mobile, however Ravi intervened and resisted. Ravi almost grabbed one of the accused, after which they started thrashing us. One of the accused then attacked Ravi on his head with a weapon he was carrying in one hand.” After thrashing the duo, the accused managed to escape from there.
 
 Abhishek took Ravi to a nearby private clinic, where he was sent home after treatment. He added: “A few hours later, around 3.30am, Ravi’s health started deteriorating. We called an ambulance and took him to a private hospital in Civil Lines. We reached there by 4am, but doctors declared him ‘brought dead’.”
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-South) Ramandeep Singh Bhullar said: “The police have registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 396 (dacoity with murder), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC. The official added that the police received   footage in which the accused were captured, and were trying to trace them.
