 Villagers In Valpoi are also unhappy as the taps run dry post 1pm. “In the absence of alternative supply, hotels and other small eateries in Valpoi are the worst affected,” said a resident of Valpoi, Tara Desai.
 
 Although some villages like Karmali and Karanzol have access to pumps, lack of electricity has proved to be a stumbling block. “We have sent our water tankers to these areas, and the contractor on duty has been making 4–5 rounds every day,” said a PWD official.
 
 The situation is no different in Sakhali. Residents have been facing water scarcity as the pressure was low throughout the day. “We are not able to cook food, bathe or carry out any household activities,” said a Sakhali local, Latif Khan.
 
 Lack of proper maintenance of machinery has also led to low water pressure in Podosem.
