Pimpri Chinchwad: The Union government has appreciated the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s helpline — Sarathi — and directed the state government to provide information about it to the cities included in its Smart Cities Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT).

 As a result, the state government sent letters to all municipal commissioners, chief executive officers of 17 municipal councils and CEO of Shirdi Nagar Panchayat in this regard.
 
 Neelkanth Poman, chief information and technology officer, PCMC, said, “Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had in a letter informed the state UDD about the Sarathi helpline and how it was providing information about the civic body and various government and semi-government services and facilities at one place. Citizens can get information through one phone call and also lodge a complaint. The helpline received tremendous response from residents in short time and has also received several government awards.”
 
 “The commissioner had also conveyed through the letter the PCMC’s readiness to organise a day-long seminar for officials and employees of municipal corporations which are included in the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT schemes on August 22 at Autocluster in Chinchwad. If the municipal corporations bear the travel expenses of their representatives, then, the PCMC will provide training and other facilities,” he said. 
 
 He has requested the UDD to take a decision on it and inform the PCMC and the civic bodies concerned, he added.
