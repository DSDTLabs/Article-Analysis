LUCKNOW: All encounters that have taken place in   in the last one year will be inquired into and guilty will be punished if they were found to be fake if the   came back to power in 2022, said Samajwadi Party national president   Yadav.

 Speaking exclusively to TOI, the former UP chief minister lamented that people from certain castes were being targeted.
 
 “When the chief minister says “goli ka jawab goli se diya jayega” (police will retaliate if criminals attack), it makes the police trigger-happy. This should not be a state policy, said Akhilesh. “Police personnel are losing their fear of the system. They feel they would get support even if they indulge in fake encounters,” he added.
 
 ‘Spurt in loot cases shows joblessness’
 
 This has never happened in the last 15 years. Even in the previous   government, certain castes were not targeted. The chief minister is under the wrong impression that crime can be controlled through encounters, while incidents of dacoity, loot, chain-snatching and road hold-ups have escalated. The sudden spurt in loot and dacoities is indicative of joblessness and unemployment,” said Akhilesh.
 
 Recounting incidents like the   police inspector who was heard on a taped phone conversation tipping off a suspect criminal about a likely encounter killing, the Noida encounter where a gym trainer was shot at by a police sub inspector and the   incident, Akhilesh said such acts should be condemned.
 
 “All encounters will be investigated when SP comes to power,” he said.
