'Total Recall' star   has said most of the time she ends up eating her meals in shower because of her 22-month-old son, Silas. 

 The 34-year-old actress revealed that she is too busy to think about food most mornings because she is so focused on feeding her little boy and getting him ready for the day. 
 
  
  
 Discussing a photo she posted on   of a coffee cup and empty plate in the shower, the star told ' ' host  , "This is just mom life. I don't know if anybody else does this, (but) I don't have time for anything. I'm feeding (Silas) in the morning, trying to get ready, and I realise I haven't eaten, and I just take (my food) into the shower." 
 
 
  
 Biel and her actor-singer husband   welcomed Silas in April 2015. It seems that being a parent has helped the actress refine her multitasking skills a bit. "Sometimes it's a huge success! Sometimes it's a huge failure," she said.
