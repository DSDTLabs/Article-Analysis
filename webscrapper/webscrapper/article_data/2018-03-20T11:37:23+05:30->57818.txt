CHENNAI : Expelled AIADMK party spokesman K C   has taken the fight to the camp of chief minister   and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, who are the party’s joint coordinator and coordinator respectively.

 Palanisamy is busy rallying like-minded partymen under a common umbrella or a front to be named after MGR. A key aide of actor   too is said to be in close touch with him. “Several like-minded party leaders are in touch with me including   (who was removed as the party’s labour wing secretary last month). We are meeting to discuss strategies to take on both EPS and OPS and keep the fight alive. But, it is too premature to discuss about how things will pan out,” he said.
 
 Maintaining that he was right in expressing his opinion that the ruling party must support the No Confidence motion against the Centre if it fails to set up the Cauvery Management Board, Palanisamy said it was “Amma’s” dream for the welfare of the state.
 
 “She fought for it till her end. She had undertaken an indefinite hunger strike in the 90s to resolve the Cauvery issue. Let OPS, who opted to meditate in Amma’s memorial for losing his chief minister’s post, undertake a hunger strike on Cauvery issue,” Palanisamy said. “I will not give up the fight until TN’s rights in the Cauvery issue are safeguarded and elections to the post of the AIADMK general secretary is held,” he added.
