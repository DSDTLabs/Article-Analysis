Nagpur: A farmers ‘padyatra’ will mark fourth anniversary of Narendra Modi’s unfulfilled election promises that he committed during a ‘chai pe charcha’ at   village in Yavatmal district. The 90-km   is to begin at Pandharkawda on April 5 and reach Dabhdi village in Arni taluka on April 8.

 It was on March 20, 2014 during the Lok Sabha election campaign at Dabhdi that Modi, as star campaigner of the BJP, held a highly-publicized and nationally telecast ‘chai pe charcha’ in which he interacted with farmers and reportedly made 19 promises to them.
 
 “Till date not even one of these promises has been fulfilled. On one promise, the Modi government has even told the Supreme Court that the MS Swaminathan recommendation of 50% profit over farm input costs as MSP cannot be given. On the remaining 18 promises, Modi and his government have kept mum,” said ex-minister and senior Congress leader Shivajirao Moghe.
 
 “We have been persistently observing the anniversary of that ‘Modi charcha’ as we feel it was an insult to the people of Dabhdi, a pilgrim centre, and farmers of Vidarbha. Far from reducing or stopping farmer suicides, there has been an increase. Two farmers have died in Dabhdi village after that Modi visit,” said Moghe.
 
 Last year, Moghe led a farmers’ team to Delhi where a protest was staged at Jantar Mantar and a 24-hour fast was observed to draw attention of Modi government. “But I must say that all our efforts failed. Till date, there is no response from the government,” Moghe added.
 
 The farmers’ protest march will culminate into a public rally on April 8 noon near Onkareshwar temple at Dabhdi. AICC secretary and MP Rajiv Satav, Swabhimani Shetkari Party chief Raju Shetty, Congress secretary Pratibha Raghuvanshi will also be present to address the rally, said Moghe.
