Panaji: In a bid to push for vermin status on animals attacking crops, farmers of Sattari Shetkari Manch are in the process of submitting details of   damage in their respective fields.

 “We are going to compensate farmers who have suffered losses. Based on their forms, we will share the data with the forest department so that they can keep a record of the ecological count of the animals. If there is an increase beyond the forest capacity, they will take action as per the Forest Wildlife Act. We have asked Zonal Agriculture Offices (ZAO) to make farmers aware of solar fencing scheme,” said Ulhas Pai Kakode, director, agriculture department. tnn
