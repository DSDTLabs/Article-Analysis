Besides known for its temples and grapes,   is also a haven for water sports activities in the state. A recently organised   festival in the city witnessed over 100 kayakers from across the country taking part at the fest. 

  For the adventure sport lovers, the fest turned out to be an eventful affair as enthusiasts indulged in kayaking by taking 1000 metre race. One of the organisers was quoted in a press release, “Such events are becoming a regular feature in Nashik and it will give fillip to water   activities.”
 
  We saw sport lovers cheering for their favourite teams and capturing every moment on camera.
