BENGALURU:  , who had to quit from the cabinet, following alleged  , was given a   by the   (CID) after the woman did a U-turn and the   said the images were blurred. 

 The eight-page report said the man in the CD cannot be conclusively identified as Meti. The 30-second clip allegedly featuring Meti, then excise minister, and a therapist in a government Ayush hospital went viral on social media in December 2016 and had embarrassed the Siddaramaiah government.
 
 Meti was forced to resign on December 14, 2016 and Siddaramaiah ordered a CID probe which was carried out without an FIR being registered.
 
 Following a five-month investigation led by a deputy superintendent of police, the CID submitted the report last week issuing a clean chit to the 71-year-old MLA from Bagalkot. The woman, who was also interrogated by the team, reportedly said her relationship with Meti was akin to a father and daughter.
 
 CID chief and DGP Kishore Chandra said: "The report has been submitted to the government early last week."
 
 Meanwhile, CID personnel said there were several constraints in the probe. "Our investigation couldn't determine the origin of the video and who recorded and circulated it. Moreover, the politician and the woman have denied they anything to do with the clip," said a CID sleuth who was part of the probe.
 
 The report said the man in the clip is not Meti and the identity of the woman couldn't be established as the face isn't clearly seen. The original video, which was reportedly 30 minutes long, was not found by the investigation team.
 
 The CD was released to the media by RTI activist Rajashekhar Mulali.
