Palanpur: A 22-year-old man attempted to kill himself by slashing his throat at a spot on a busy road leading to Gabbar outside the famous Ambaji temple on Friday.  Paras Parihar, who was working as a private security guard in Ahmedabad, said that he wanted to offer his own ‘sacrifice’ to the goddess. Parihar was rushed to the Palanpur Civil Hospital and doctors said they had to take stitches on his throat. However, he is said to be out of danger.  UD Jadeja, police sub inspector, Ambaji police station, said, “Parihar came to Ambaji on Thursday night. In the morning, he purchased a knife from the market. He reached the spot where devotees break coconuts for offering and slashed his throat. People near by called for an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital.”  Preliminary investigations revealed that Parihar, a native of Chandpura village of Uttar Pradesh’s Amirpur district, was undergoing some financial problems. However, Parihar said at the hospital that he had pledged to sacrifice himself after his wish had been fulfilled by the goddess. “I was to sacrifice myself but people present near-by stopped me and snatched the knife. I was unconscious when brought to the hospital,” he said. Dr Haresh Gadhvi, who was attending to him, said, “We found his mobile without battery from the bag. However with the help of sim card, we contacted his relatives.” Parihar has been living in Ahmedabad’s Memnagar area since four months.
