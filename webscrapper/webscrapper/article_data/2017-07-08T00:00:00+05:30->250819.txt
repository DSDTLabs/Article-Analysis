Close on the heels of Pranav Mohanlal’s relaunch in films, the youngter’s friend and   and Lissy’s daughter   too is gearing up to make her big screen debut. Not in Malayalam though, but in 24 director Vikram Kumar’s upcoming Telugu film.
 
 The Malayali director, who had assisted Priyadarshan in films such as Chandralekha, tells us, “Kalyani has been roped in as the female lead of the movie, which has   as the male protagonist. I had worked under Priyan sir for eight years. She was a kid back then. So, we are looking forward to having her on board the movie.”
  
 The film, Vikram says, will be an action romance. “It’s too soon to reveal about their characters or the storyline. We have already started shooting the action scenes,” he says, adding that Kalyani is expected to join the sets in about 10 days.
  
  Meanwhile, the   says she’s all in support of her daughter’s career move. “Since both of us, her parents, are in the film field, I always knew she would be part of the same industry. After she got back from her studies in the US, she said she would like to take up acting, and she’s now determined to make it work,” says Lissy.
  
 While the yesteryear actress refuses to divulge anything more, a source close to the family tells us why Kalyani decided to commit to the   project.
  
 “Usually when a person makes their acting debut, they would be lucky if they get to work with either a good director or land a good role. In this case, everything came together – Vikram’s previous Telugu movie Manam was both critically and commercially acclaimed, the banner is spearheaded by the Nagarjuna family and the movie also has a brilliant subject,” says the source.
