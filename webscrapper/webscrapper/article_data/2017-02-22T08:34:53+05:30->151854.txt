MYSURU: During the daylong trade   renewal mela organized by Hotel Owners’ Association in association with Mysuru City Corporation on Tuesday, the civic body had a record  . They managed to collect Rs 20,80,596 with the   of 363 licence in the association premises in Krishnamurthypuram here.

 The mela was conducted for hoteliers with an intention to ease the process of trade licence renewal. Earlier, hoteliers, along with bakers and sweet sellers, used to go to the corporation to get their licences renewed. But the process was cumbersome as the formalities were not people-friendly. The new process enables hoteliers and other licence-seekers to get their work done under one roof, instead of going to different departments. Here, the officials from all the nine zones of   process the applications and do the needful within a few minutes. This is third such mela conducted by the association. The previous ones were held in 2016 and 2012. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, association president Narayanagowda said: “The system is helping hoteliers get their licence renewed easily. During a similar mela last year, we collected Rs 14.75 lakh after renewing about 300 licences. This year, we got an overwhelming response. We managed to renew 363 licences with a record collection of Rs 20,80,596. The highest trade licence renewal was from zone 6 — 204 licences were renewed yielding Rs 12,85,118. The poor response was witnessed at zone 8, where just 1 licence was renewed.”
 
 The renewal fee, which starts at Rs 600, is directly proportional to the size of the hotel or firm. Those who fail to get their trade licence renewed on or before February 28 will have to pay fine. Between February 28 and March 31, they need to pay 25% more on their licence fee. The fine will increase if they pay from April. Twenty days prior to the event, the organizers had intimated the stakeholders about the mela. The event was inaugurated by MCC commissioner Jagadeesh.
