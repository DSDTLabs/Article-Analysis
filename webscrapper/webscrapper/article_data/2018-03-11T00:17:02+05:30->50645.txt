Pune: The city-based ‘Pedestrians First’ has approached the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as well as the commissioner of police, seeking safety measures for  , cyclists and schoolchildren during the ongoing Metro rail work in the city. 

 In a letter, the organization has pointed out the lack of safety measures on Karve and Law college roads and said that the situation has become tough and highly unsafe for pedestrians. 
 
 Prashant Inamdar, of the organization, said that there is heavy pedestrian movement and a large number of schools in places where the work has begun. “It is seen that no thought has been given for convenience and safety of schoolchildren, pedestrians, bus commuters and cyclists. In fact existing facilities are also being reduced or dismantled to facilitate Metro work. As a result the situation has become very tough and highly unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists,” Inamdar said.
 
 Inamdar further pointed out that on Paud Road, people are forced to walk on the carriageway, which has already been narrowed substantially. Safe road crossings have also not been provided at intermediate locations, he added. 
 
 Inamdar said that safe pedestrian crossings should be made available on Law College Road at Athawale Chowk. He further said a cycle track, built 12 years ago between Athawale chowk and Nal Stop for schoolchildren, was demolished to increase the road width. Similar measures were taken on Canal Road, where cycle tracks were removed and footpath width reduced to increase the width of the carriageway.
 
 “PMC should immediately take a policy decision that henceforth, footpath width would not be reduced and cycle tracks would not be removed for the purpose of road widening to facilitate Metro work,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the state government has allotted Rs130 crore for   in the state budget for 2018-19. The allocation for Pune and Nagpur metro projects has been substantially hiked, MahaMetro said.
