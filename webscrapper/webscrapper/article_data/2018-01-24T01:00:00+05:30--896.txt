 Gulati, who plays the parallel lead alongside   on ' ', is a disappointed man. Within just three months of its launch, the show is being pulled off air, as it has not been able to strike a chord with the audiences.
Aashim says, “It is too early to pull the plug on the show. We hadn’t even started the real story, the characters were not really established. Also, I feel that there wasn’t much awareness about the show.” 
 With the show revolving around an older man marrying a younger girl and also adultery, did the show wrap up because of its bold subjects? He says, “I don’t think so. There have been shows like Hasratein in the olden days, which dealt with such subjects. In fact, people liked our concept, and I have been receiving a lot of mails from the UK and   after people came to know that the show is going off air. They want it to continue.”
 Earlier, Aashim had been part of a finite show, 'Gulmohur Grand', and had also played the lead in the   film, 'Tum Bin 2'. Ask him what he plans to do next and he says, “I am not restricting myself to any medium, but I would like to do TV shows with interesting concepts and meaty roles. When something doesn’t work out, you have to understand that God wants you to move on to better things.” 
 Aashim, who belongs to Delhi, finds Mumbai to be an interesting city. He says, “There are plenty of opportunities here, but if you don’t adapt yourself and keep resisting change, you will soon find yourself with nothing. One has to welcome change here.”
 On the personal front, the actor was in a long-distance relationship, but is single now. “It’s over. I loved the girl, but it didn’t work out. I want to focus on my work now. I am planning to travel to the UK for a month. You’ll get a girl only if you earn well and do good in life,” he signs off with a smile.
