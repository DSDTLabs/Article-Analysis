NEW DELHI: At 8am, six men would leave for work, like most normal people. At 8pm, they will return, again, like most normal people. But there is something different about them—they are  . 

 They are beneficiaries of an extension of the ‘open jail’ programme that has been on at the jail since 2013. “These six have been short-listed based on their conduct inside the jail. We are still in talks with various people from different fields to find them jobs,” said  , director general (prisons). “This, however, is the first time that such an initiative is being taken in Delhi that would allow inmates to work in the outside world,” he added. 
 
 As many as 78 inmates have been lodged in the   since its inception. Some of them were offered jobs inside the jail, and were allowed to go on parole and furlough several times. “They have always returned on time and have never been involved in any untoward incidents while serving their sentence,” said a jail official. 
 
 Jail officials said they have been in talks with milk product companies, petrol pumps, fitness centres and restaurants to find these inmates jobs. So, why are they the chosen ones? Officials say it’s because of their   ever since their imprisonment. 
 
 As of now, the inmates wake up at 6am and get busy with their daily chores. “Two of the short-listed inmates work in the jail canteen, two in the food court, and one each in the cleanliness team and kitchen,” said the official. They all have been cooks in the past. One of them is also a fitness enthusiast and wants to be a trainer once he gets out. 
 
 Jail authorities say that these inmates would spend the last two years of the sentence in this way and, hopefully, would be equipped to face life outside. Authorities also say that the programme would be improvised in the future and include more eligible inmates.
