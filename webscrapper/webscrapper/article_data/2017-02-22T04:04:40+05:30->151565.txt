AHMEDABAD: The National Lok Adalat held earlier this month witnessed the solution to a four-decade old litigation, in which a   (FCI) recovery claim was pending.

 As the case could not be sorted out in the courts, the private party and FCI settled the issue by reaching an agreement on the payment of Rs 11 lakh. 
 
 This happened in the court of additional senior civil judge M D   at   rural court campus. Along with this, four other attached litigations also ended.
 
 The Lok Adalat was held by   and over 3,000 cases pertaining to such recovery claims and land acquisition were resolved by private persons and government bodies with the intervention of judicial officers.
 
 Speaking to mediapersons on the occasion, Justice M R Shah, executive chairman of Gujarat State Legal Service Authority and Gujarat high court, said that with initiatives like Lok Adalat, the great burden on the higher judiciary can be reduced, and people can get speedy justice.
 
 A few years ago, in their bid to reduce pendency in petty and miscellaneous cases, the state government and judiciary launched a project of ‘evening courts’. Certain courts would work extra hours to deal with criminal cases, in which poor people were facing charges for petty offences for years together. 
 
 This model of evening court was later replicated by various other states.
