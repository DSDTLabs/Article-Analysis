TIRUPUR: The city corporation and Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) have finally taken steps to repair the damaged pipelines of the first and second water schemes. The corporation also stopped the water supply for two days for the same.

 The first and second water schemes were implemented by drawing water from the Bhavani river at   in Coimbatore. The 51-year-old first water scheme, with a capacity to supply 4.7 million litres per day (MLD), was owned by the corporation, while the second water scheme, with a capacity to supply 26MLD, was owned by the TWAD.
 
 In the second water scheme, 600mm pipeline was laid from Mettupalayam to Tirupur. There were often complaints of water leak duo to pipeline damage. A senior corporation official admitted that out of 26MLD, 6 MLD was wasted due to leak and other reasons daily.
 
 At   on   road, there were seven damages to the pipeline and thousands of litres of water had gone waste daily in the past two months. Despite protests, the issue was not addressed. 
 
 When contacted, a TWAD official said, “Since Tirupur-Avinashi road was administered by the  , we had to obtain permission from them as well as the police to repair the damages. The permission was not granted immediately after we approached them. Hence, the delay.”
