MUMBAI: The Shiv   has supported the candidature of   nominee   for the May 28 Pulus-Kadegaon assembly by-election in Sangli, in yet another move that pits it against its alliance partner. 

 The  , which is also in the fray, has fielded Sangram Deshmukh. 
 
 A Shiv Sena spokesperson said it was party president Uddhav Thackeray's decision to support the nomination of Vishwajeet since he is the son of the late Patangrao Kadam, a veteran from western Maharashtra. 
 
 "It's a tradition of the Sena. Whenever the son or daughter of a deceased legislator or MP contests a by-election, the Sena supports him or her. After the death of Gopinath Munde, Sena supported his daughters in Lok Sabha and assembly polls," he said.
 
 In neighbouring Palghar, following the entry of Bahujan Vikas Aghadi's former MP Baliram Jadhav, a quadrangular contest is now on the cards. Here too, the Sena has taken on the BJP by nominating the son of the late BJP MP Chintaman Wanga as its candidate. BJP has nominated former Congress leader  , and Congress has fielded former MP Damu Shingda.
 
 The Sena had sprung a surprise after the Wanga family approached Thackeray for support saying they were being ignored by the BJP leadership. Wanga had represented Palghar for three terms. Thackeray promptly announced Avinash as his candidate, following which a peeved Fadnavis engineered a defection in Congress to nominate Gavit, a seasoned politician from the same tribal region, as his party's nominee. 
 
 Meanwhile in Bhandara-Gondia, it's a face-off between BJP's Hemant Patle and rebel Madhukar Kukade who will be the Congress-NCP nominee. It was assumed that   (NCP) or Nana Patole (Congress) would contest, but following Rahul Gandhi's intervention, the party decided to leave the seat to Kukade.
