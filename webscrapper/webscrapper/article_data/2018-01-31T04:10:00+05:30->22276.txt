Vadodara: Over eight decades after it was built, Kirti Mandir is all set to undergo a major refurbishment.  The royal Gaekwad family has decided to carry out repairs in the building that was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1936. The royal cenotaph was made to perpetuate the memory of the royal Gaekwad family’s ancestors.  Once the restoring of exquisite paintings made by famed artist Nandlal Bose in the Kirti Mandir finishes, the royal family will move ahead with the refurbishment project. “Kirti Mandir is an old structure and it needs repairs. We have decided to restore the damaged parts including cracks in the building in the coming months. It is an important part of our heritage,” said Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, royal scion.  “Several old structures suffered damages after the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat. The buildings made of stone developed cracks. So, it is necessary to restore heritage structures to enhance their life,” Gaekwad told TOI. When asked when he intends to start the restoration, Gaekwad said that he hasn’t decided on the timeframe yet. “It is a costly affair so we will have to arrange for the funds first. Also, restoring heritage buildings requires special expertise. We need to find a right team to do it,” he added.  The E-shaped Kirti Mandir has a beautifully carved 35-metre tall ‘Shikhar’ that represents the sun, moon and earth along with an undivided map of India. It is located on the banks of Vishwamitri River opposite the SSG Hospital. The wall paintings made by Nandlal Bose on the ceiling and walls of this building are a major attraction for the art lovers.  The building has a big hall on the ground floor and several rooms on the first floor where ashes of the deceased members of royal family are kept. The building remains close to public throughout the year. The only time citizens can walk in Kirti Mandir is during Diwali when a Rangoli exhibition is organized there.
