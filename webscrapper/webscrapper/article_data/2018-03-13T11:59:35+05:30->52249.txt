PATNA:   and former CM   on Monday took a swipe at  , saying the saffron party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) only make false propaganda of constructing Ram temple at   with the sole intention of winning elections.

 “The BJP and RSS will never comment on when the temple will actually be built,”   said while talking to mediapersons outside the assembly after filing of nomination papers for biennial Rajya Sabha elections by two RJD candidates.
 
 Rabri’s statement came three days after her elder son and former state health minister Tej Pratap Yadav’s alleged remark in Nalanda that RJD, and not BJP, will construct Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.TNN
