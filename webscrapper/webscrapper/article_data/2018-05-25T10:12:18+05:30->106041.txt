KANNUR: The police team probing the murder of RSS worker U C Shamej at Peringadi near  , under New Mahe police limits in the district on May 7, has arrested three more   workers. 

 
 According to police, the three men   (49), Sajeesh alias Shaji (46) and Raheen alias Kudu (28), all residents of New Mahe were arrested on May 23 night from near Mahe railway station. With this, the number of people arrested in the case rose to six. Last week three CPM workers were arrested. 
 
  The trio allegedly dragged Shamej out of the autorickshaw when he was coming back home around 10pm, thus facilitating others to kill him, said police. 
 
 However, there is no possibility of any conspiracy because this murder happened within minutes of the murder of CPM local leader Kannippoyil Babu at   in Mahe earlier on May 7 night, said police. In all possibility, the RSS worker was murdered as an act of retaliation, they said.
 
 Meanwhile, Palloor police on Thursday arrested six people in connection with the violence during the time of the funeral procession of Babu. Earlier, eight people were arrested in connection with the incident.
 
 In Babu's murder also, which is investigated by Puducherry police, the general feeling is that there is no conspiracy as such. The police had said that Babu was hacked to death as a result of 'long-standing enmity'. Four people have been arrested in this case as well and probe is on to identify others involved in the murder. 
 
 Though the investigating team got the custody of RSS worker  , who was arrested earlier in connection with the murder of Babu, a local court in Mahe rejected the plea of the police to get the custody of Shyamjith T P, another accused, after he alleged custodial torture. 
 
 It was on the night of May 7 that the twin murders were committed in Mahe and New Mahe within the gap of a few minutes.
