KOLKATA: Vedanta is all set to take over Kolkata-based   Steels. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Kolkata bench, on Tuesday approved the resolution plan of the Anil Agarwal- led company, endorsing the views of the committee of creditors (CoC).

 The creditors had approved Vedanta’s bid after a six-hour meeting on March 29, which was challenged by   at the NCLT. Vedanta had revised its bid to Rs 5,320 crore. Following the NCLT order, Vedanta on Tuesday said that — pursuant to the resolution plan — a wholly owned subsidiary of the company will subscribe to the share capital of Electrosteel for Rs 1,805 crore and provide additional funds aggregating to Rs 3,515 crore by way of debt. Upon implementation of the resolution plan, the company will hold approximately 90% of the paidup share capital of Electrosteel.
 
 The remaining 10% share capital will be held by Electrosteel’s shareholders and financial creditors, who received stock in exchange for the debt owed to them. Electrosteel owns and operates a greenfield integrated steel manufacturing facility near Bokaro, which has a current capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum with the potential to increase it to 2.5 mtpa. Vedanta said, “The directors of the company believe that the transaction will complement the group’s existing iron ore business as the vertical integration of steel manufacturing capabilities has the potential to generate significant efficiencies.”
 
 Earlier, the Dalmias-owned Renaissance Steel had questioned eligibility of Vedanta along with Tata Steel.
