LUCKNOW: Almost a month since Om Prakash Sahu’s 16-year-old son Shivyansh, class X student at a prominent city school, shot himself with a double-barrel gun, he has an appeal for all educational institutions.

 “Too many tests lead to stress. And the age of 15-16, it is difficult for children to cope with this kind of pressure. I think all schools should cut down on the number of exams,’’ he said.
 
 Sahu added, “Pre-boards are meant to prepare students for the final boards. So they should be held on the same pattern. The point of concern is that there are no gaps between the papers. If there are ten papers, they are held continuously, one after the other. It becomes diffiuclt for a child to revise the entire book in a span of few hours. I feel this took a toll on my son. I request all schools to modify their schedule so that more students do not fall prey to this.’’ 
 
 Shiyansh secured 72% in his first pre-boards, results of which were declared on January 9. And in the Hindi paper which he wrote on January 11, the day he killed himself, he scored 68 marks out of 80. 
 
 The most unexpected part for Sahu was that his son would get hold of his gun in his absence. “He was a well-mannered boy. He used to touch our feet every morning before leaving for school. We had never locked our almirah as we had mutual trust. May be, if we had locked the almirah and put the keys away, he would’ve been alive,” said Sahu, tears rolling down his eyes. 
 
 Recalling a recent family trip to Rameshwaram and Kanyakumari, Sahu said, “He (Shivyansh) wanted to us to take a flight so I booked air tickets for all of us. In just six days, he took over 1,000 photographs, mostly selfies. We returned on January 3, not knowing that would be his last trip with us.’’
