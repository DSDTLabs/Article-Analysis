When it was time to shake the stress of the week away, a bunch of the cityâ€™s party folk made their way to The Pallet Brewhouse & Kitchen in Whitefield. Folk rock fusion band   kept the mood upbeat with their electrifying act, which kept revellers on the dance floor. Seen having a groovy time at the do were Anamika, Renu and  , among others.
