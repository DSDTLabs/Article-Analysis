Visakhapatnam:   has arrived in the city, with mercury staying above normal ever since the beginning of this month. However, many public places and junctions in the city are yet to get drinking water-cum-first aid kiosks in order to help citizens beat the scorching heat.

 On Tuesday, the meteorology observatory centre at the Vizag airport registered 38.4°C against the normal of 34°C. Similarly, Waltair area (close to the beach) registered a high of 33°C as against the normal of 31°C.
 
 “While the airport area registered a temperature of 4.4°C above normal, Waltair registered 2°C above normal. The city is registering temperatures beyond normal ever since March 1,” a senior official at Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC) in the city told TOI.
 
 Despite the mercury staying appreciably above normal, authorities like the GVMC, APSRTC, and other social welfare organisations are yet to gear up to deal with summer such as putting up   kiosks across the city, said RN Madhavi, secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Welfare Association (AIDWA).
 
 K Mahesh, a marketing executive of a real estate company in the city who was spotted buying water pouches at a pan shop in Isukathota, said he failed to find any public water   so far. He has to shell out at least Rs 20 daily to purchase water packets and butter milk to quench his thirst, he said. Madhavi said she has hardly seem any water kiosk or first aid place at public places like bus stops and along main roads. 
 
 “Areas like Akkayyapalem, Gajuwaka, Pendurty and Madhurawada get quite hot during the summer. Officials should make immediate arrangements to set up kiosks,” Madhavi added.
 
 GVMC commissioner M Hari Narayanan said they prepared a summer action plan for the city water needs, but are still undecided on the number of water kiosks that will be set up in the city.
 
 “Planning is still on. By April 1, we will have a clear picture on the number of kiosks required for the city,” the civic chief told TOI.
