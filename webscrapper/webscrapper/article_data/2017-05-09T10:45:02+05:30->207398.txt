KOLKATA:   president   may have ruled out the merger of I-League and Indian Super League (ISL) for now, but a clear picture is yet to emerge on the future of the two leagues which are supposed to be played simultaneously.

 The good thing is that the I-League will remain the country's official top-tier league, but there is a genuine concern among top Indian clubs that the tournament may lose out to ISL, both in terms of revenue and top players.
 
 The peril of holding ISL and I-League simultaneously is that the players can't play both tournaments. Since the ISL was launched in 2014, select Indian players and foreigners have been switching over to I-League after plying their trade in the cash-rich franchise league. The ILeague clubs which do not have deep pockets could lose out big time to ISL franchises when it comes to attracting top players to their clubs.
 
 In order to circumvent this problem, Bagan representative   had suggested at the meeting that "the I-League and ISL should be played for four months each and separately". He also suggested that as the I-League will continue to be the country's official toptier meet, the winners should be given the license to play the   Champions League qualifier.
 
  officials are also opposed to  's idea of conducting parallel leagues. "Two leagues can't run at the same time," said senior East Bengal official  . "It is better if you have all 18 teams in one league. It will at least give all teams a fair chance to compete on the same platform."
 
 Patel in turn assured all that the merger of the two leagues will take place after two or three years. In the meantime, the AIFF would nurture I-League and ISL in the right earnest. The AIFF president also assured the club representatives that the broadcast and production of I-League matches will be improved which should help the teams to rope in sponsors. He also assured that the AIFF would extend financial help to I-League sides from the federation's revenue pool.
