AHMEDABAD:   on Monday spelled mixed fortunes for students. While the economics and maths papers for   were not difficult, it took more time than expected to answer them, said students. For  , the   was an easy one and they finished in time.

 Class XII science stream students said multiple choice questions in part-A of the maths paper required detailed calculations and consumed much of their time, thus reducing the time available to answer other questions.
 
 “On a first glance the paper looked easy, but as I started answering, I realized the calculations were taking up time. I could not attempt questions worth five marks in part-A. On the other hand, part-B was very easy, and I guess I performed well,” said Subin Thomas, a student of class XII science stream.
 
 The situation was more or less similar for the economics paper for students of class XII general stream. They said the paper was easy but answers took longer than usual due to details. Some of them could not attempt a few questions.
 
 On the other hand, class X students reported their maths paper was easier than they had expected. Questions worth 41 marks in part-B of the paper were directly from the text book, and that too without any change in values. Only the objective questions, worth two marks each, were application-based questions and required clear concepts.
