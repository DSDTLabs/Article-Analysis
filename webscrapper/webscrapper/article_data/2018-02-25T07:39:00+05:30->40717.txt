KOLKATA: A five-year-old girl received severe head injuries after a fall from a ride at a Shivratri fair in the   area around 8pm on Friday. The child and her cousins - aged between seven and 10 - were on a pirate ship when she fell to the ground. 

 Locals took   to SSKM Hospital, but later shifted her to   where she underwent a surgery and is now in the ICU. Doctors said she has regained consciousness, but it will take time before she can be declared completely out of danger.
 
 The accident cast a shadow on the decades-old fair, but united its stakeholders and locals who have pledged to ensure that the child pulls through. Locals and club members from the  , along with the residents of Bhukailash Rajbari, pooled together money for her treatment. "We are too poor to come up with a few lakhs for my daughter's treatment. The club members have made all payments," said Bishnu Mishra, the girl's uncle. The fair was shut after the incident and resumed on Saturday, but the rides have been stopped. "Next year, we will be extra careful before allowing the fair operators here," said Laltu Ghosal, a local. 
 
 According to the girl's father Rajendra, Samriddhi had travelled with her mother from Chowbaga near Tiljala to her maternal uncle's house in Kidderpore to go to the fair like previous years. "My wife was supposed to go on the ride with Samriddhi, but decided against it," he said. 
 
 Rajendra complained that the girl's treatment was delayed at SSKM. "They did nothing, only asking us to be patient," he said. SSKM authorities, however, denied there was any delay. 
 
 DC (Port)   said they registered a FIR under IPC Section 338 against the owner of the company that owns the ride, Meerun Das, and his representative Bishnu Das. 
 
 The South Port police said: "We are taking down their statement. Contrary to local claims, the child slipped from her mother's lap We are ascertaining if the ride operator had necessary permissions from all quarters,"said an officer.
