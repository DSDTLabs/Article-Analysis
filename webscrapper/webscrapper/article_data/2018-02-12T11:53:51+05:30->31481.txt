Before Holi, a drive against food adulteration: With Holi festival drawing nearer, health department officials are gearing up to prevent sale of adulterated food.

 The health directorate issued directions to all district officials to launch the statewide campaign against adulteration from February 14 to February 28.
 
 However, health authorities will not check the quality of colour used for playing Holi as it does not fall in the food items category. A health department official said that they do not have the authority to prevent the sale of harmful colours.
 
 Fifteen teams of food safety officials, including five from the state level, four from Jaipur city, two from Jaipur rural and three from the division level, will collect food samples from city and rural areas.
 
 Officials said that each food safety team will collect five samples of food and send it to the laboratory for testing.
 
 Besides, the health department has identified Alwar, Bharatpur and   as sensitive places for food adulteration. In these three districts, the department has directed officials to collect at at least six samples for testing.
 
 Officials have also been directed to destroy foods items which are suspected to be adulterated.
 
 Chief medical health officer Jaipur (I) Dr Narrotam Sharma said, “We will start taking samples of food samples from February 14. During festivals such as   and Holi, chances of food adulteration increases with the rise in demand for food products.”
 
 Officials will keep a check on food made from milk. During festivals, the demand of milk and ‘mawa’ (milk product) used for making sweets increases.
 
 Teams will also collect samples of edible oil and conduct sudden inspections on units making mawa and sweets.
