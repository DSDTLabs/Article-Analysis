DHANDBAD: After   (PAP), a multidimensional joint plan to develop Parasnath and suburban areas in Giridih, the state government has chalked out a fresh strategy for all-round development of far flung areas of Parasnath region, a major Jain pilgrimage site. 

 The district officials have identified about 30 inaccessible remote villages of Pirtand and Dumri blocks for this purpose. Road construction, transportation, availability of schools and other educational institutions for rural masses, health centres, water and power facilities, sanitation and vocational classes for rural women are among the government's development plans. 
 
 "We are acting on several plans, including PAP, to address the core issues of Maoist-affected areas in the district. Apart from proper development of the region, our motive is to draw the attention of local youths, who have diverted from the mainstream, towards self-development," said DDC  . 
 
 "A blueprint has been prepared and sent to the authorities concerned for further procedures. While, 20 out of all 30 Naxal-hit villages come under six panchayats of Pirtand, 10 fall under four panchayats in Dumri block of the district,'' said  . 
 
 Singhpur, Palma, Dholkatta, Pipradih and   of Pirtand and Tesapuli, Chalkari and Nagabad of Dumri block are among 30 extremely hypersensitive underdeveloped villages to be developed under the plan. 
 
 The Jharkhand government had in April 2015, launched PAP on the lines of Saranda Action Plan (SAP) for all-round development of unreachable and inaccessible villages across Maoist - hit Parasnath valleys, covering portions of Giridih and Dhanbad districts of Jharkhand.
