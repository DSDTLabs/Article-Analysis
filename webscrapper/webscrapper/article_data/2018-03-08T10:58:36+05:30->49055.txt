NEW DELHI: Two years back, while scouting for potential archers, coach Richpal Singh Salaria had picked a bunch of youngsters for training. The bunch included a 15-year-old 10th-grade-student from Kendriya Vidyalaya in  , Madhya Pradesh -  .

 
 Making rapid strides under coach Salaria, Muskan broke into the senior side within just one year and reached the top of the podium in a major international event on Wednesday when she clinched the women's compound gold in   in Bangkok .
 
 Among other Indians, Promila Daimary also secured a gold medal winning the women's recurve title.
 
 “Her family wants her to be a doctor, so they were taken aback when I selected Muskan for   training in April 2016,” an overjoyed Salaria told TOI from Bangkok. “It's a moment of great pride for me that she proved me right by winning the gold with less than two years of training."
 
 The coach said that Muskan, who just turned 17, picked up the game so fast that even the authorities at her school thought she had been practicing archery secretly for years before being selected by Salaria.
 
 “Within few months of training, she played in the age categories and even won a gold in u-17 event in Bhubaneswar last year. She subsequently made it to the senior team and took part in the Asia Cup in 2017. She has a technically sound game and a very good attitude, which is helping her do well.”
 
 The coach said that Muskan, daughter of a shopkeeper, had some “unbelievable” scores while winning the gold in Bangkok. Next goal? “Now the focus is on the Asian Games. I am sure she has the game and the ability to bring laurels for the country,” the coach said.
 
 Congratulating Muskan Madhya Prtadesh sports minister   said, “This is what I have been saying for the past many years that the opening of sports academies in the state was one of the best decisions. Muskan has given the best gift to the state on the eve of Women’s Day.”
