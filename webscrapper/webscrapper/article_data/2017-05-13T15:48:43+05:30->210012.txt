Ranchi: The Jharkhand government has constituted a   council after the state witnessed more than 1,200 road accidents in the first three months of 2017. 

 The council headed by chief minister   as its chairman has been entrusted to enforce road safety norms across national highways, inter-state highways and roads within urban limits and bring to book traffic violators. 
 
 Nidhi Khare, the spokesperson for the state government, convened a press meet at Ranchiâ€™s Suchana Bhawan on Friday and informed media persons about the constitution of the state council, which will enforce road safety rules at the ground. The district road safety councils will be led by deputy commissioners of 24 districts. 
 
 Over 20,000 traffic violations have been booked across cities and towns of Jharkhand since March. More than 190 cases of seat belt violations, 100 cases of drink driving and over-speeding have been recorded. 
 
 A total of 851 public transport vehicles have been penalised for plying with more passengers than its capacity, the state transport department said. 
 
 Data with the state transport department revealed that a total of 779 people have died in road accidents across the state between January and March while more than 1,000 people were injured. The numbers have risen from 2016, when 749 people died in 1,238 accidents between January and March. 
 
 Khare said the government has purchased breathalysers, CCTV cameras and other equipment for enforcement of traffic rules in six districts while procurement is ongoing for other six. 
 
 However, timely treatment of   victims remains a major concern as the state does not have adequate trauma centres along its highways. At present, only two trauma centres are operational in Baharagora (East Singbhum) and Nagar Untari (Garhwa) off national highways. 
 
 The state health department has proposed to construct three trauma centresin Barhi (Hazaribag), Bundu (Ranchi) and Kuru (Lohardaga).
