KOLKATA: Visitors to India will now be able to plan their itinerary way ahead of the trip with the   deciding to sell them tickets a year in advance. The facility will be available for trains like Rajdhani, Duronto and  , and the travellers need to book seats in the executive class, AC first or second class. 

 The fare for these seats is 1.5 times more than the base fare and, on cancellation, 50% of the ticket price will be deducted, an official said. He added that this was being started on a trial basis and depending on the feedback, the facility can be provided to other trains as well.
 
 The tourists will only be able to book tickets online. They will have to provide their passport details and international phone numbers. The passengers will be able to pay via debit or credit card and they will get an SMS, which they need to provide to book the ticket. The railways won’t allow local agents to buy the tickets on behalf of the tourists
 
 Prof   a teacher of Jagannath University, Bangladesh, said “Often we need to come to India, but getting a visa is a problem. If the ticket is booked, it will help with the process.” A diplomat with the   deputy high commission, however, felt if one does not have a visa, train tickets won’t help. “There should be a system where Bangladeshi citizens availing of this offer get their visas faster.”
