LUCKNOW: The drive against   is turning out to be a dud for want of   to take on   who gang up against checking teams or drop names to get away.

 On Wednesday, field staff of   (Lesa) had to face the ire of consumers when in Juggaur, Chinhat, locals disrupted checking. The field staff had to beat a retreat to ensure its safety.
 
 This is not the first time that Lesa staff has been threatened. “The teams are yet to get the support of police and district administration. At times, police do not even lodge an FIR or take too long to do so,” said a source.
 
 The checking team complained at Chinhat police station to lodge an FIR against five consumers drawing electricity directly from the LT line without any meters installed. The defaulters refused to pay the compounding fee and could not present the documents of connection. Consumers of the locality came together in defence of the defaulters.
 
 Though UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has been insisting to be firm on the “bigger fish”, those in the field rue that it is almost impossible to take action against musclemen, government officers and people with even a remote political background.
 
 UPPCL also does not keep any record of those who disrupt checking or drop names to escape punishment.
 
 “The field staff is, at times, scared to even mention the names of those who disrupt checking, fearing action against them,” said a source.
