LUCKNOW: Going against the rules, several people were allowed to meet Mau Sadar   Mukhtar Ansari during his stay at SGPGI in Lucknow.

 While on the first day, police took a lenient view considering Ansari's health condition, on Wednesday, a large crowd gathered outside the hospital soon after word spread that his condition was normal.
 Independent MLA from Kunda Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya and   from Rampur Khas Aradhana Mishra were among those who met Ansari, despite being aware that the MLA was in judicial custody.
 
 ADG law and order   said he was examining the matter and had asked police personnel on duty to provide a list of names of people who had visited Ansari despite being warned not to do so.
 
 “On Tuesday night, a large crowd had gathered at the hospital soon after Ansari was brought to SGPGI. The local police had detained about a dozen people. They were told that they could only meet the MLA after due permission since he is facing trials and is a jail inmate. However, some people took the law into their hands. I will seek a report from   and Lucknow police units,” said Kumar.
