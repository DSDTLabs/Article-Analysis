PUNE: An   from the city has filed a complaint against the owner of an animal shelter for alleged hoarding. 

 While   have claimed that the owner of the shelter, identified as Amit Shah, is illegally hoarding the animals, Shah has countered the complaint saying that the issue has been blown up to “defame him”.
 
 As per the complaint filed with the Bharatiya Vidyapeeth police station by animal welfare activist Vineeta Vadhera, Shah has been keeping around 48   in small   unfit for the animals. “These stray dogs have been sheltered without any permission from authorities concerned in the property owned by Shah in  ,” Vadhera has stated in her complaint.
 
 Police registered a non-cognizable (NC) offence against Shah under sections 3 and 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Speaking about the case, animal welfare officer Meher Mathrani said Shah had been contacted by animal welfare representatives over a period of six months with solutions to improve the conditions in which the stray dogs kept are being kept. “However, he has chosen to ignore all our suggestions even as the animals continue to suffer. The hoarding of stray dogs is not acceptable,” she told TOI.
 
 When contacted, property investor Shah denied the allegations. “The entire matter has been blown out to defame me. There is a mala fide intent here to take over my shelter, which I run on my private property with my own funds. Yes, there used to be nearly 120 dogs on the campus, but now there are just about 48 as the others were released or adopted. I will be filing a complaint of trespassing against the people involved,” Shah said.
 
 “The photos of the premises, which are being used against me, are from 4-5 months ago and the facility has undergone changes since then,” he added.
 
 Mathrani said, “Hopefully the animals will be free soon and shifted to an interim home awaiting adoption. There is a great need for halfway homes, animal medical centres and ambulance services in the city.”
