PANAJI: The state BJP government is making a mockery of democracy during the whole process of conducting panchayat elections purely to serve its political interest and not of the people,   and AICC secretary Girish Chodankar said.

 “The manipulations done by chief minister   and his coalition partners during delimitation is setting an example before the younger generation that politics means only manipulation and autocracy. It isn’t providing a level playing field nor a real democracy,” said Chodankar.
 
 He also pointed out that Goa government has brazenly violated the Goa Panchayati Raj Act when Article 243 K specifically gives powers to delimit and reserve the wards to the Goa state election commission and not the state government. 
 
 Chodankar said that there are blunders created of dividing the voters of the same locality and even of the same family in two different wards.
 
 In a similar manner, alleged Chodankar, that the BJP-led government has reserved wards to qualify or disqualify certain candidates irrespective of presence of reserved category voters in the locality. 
 
 The government has not followed any   while doing reservation of all categories. In some cases, where reservation was not possible, ward numbers were changed to suit the needs of the BJP, Congress said.
