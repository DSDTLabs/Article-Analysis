BULANDSHAHR: An   who had eloped a week ago from   village, following which a Muslim man was allegedly beaten to death by right-wing activists in the nearby Sohi village, was detained by the police in the early hours of Wednesday, police announced in a press conference on Thursday. 

 The 24-year-old man and 19-year-old woman, whose names have been withheld by TOI, eloped on April 27. The woman's father had registered a complaint with police accusing the youth of kidnapping his daughter. Ghulam Mohammad, a distant relative of the youth, was allegedly lynched on suspicion of knowing the whereabouts of the couple by Hindu Yuva Vahini activists, police revealed.
 
 According to SP (rural) Jagdish Sharma, "Throughout the week special teams constituted for the purpose had been on the couple's trail and their location kept shifting from Mathura to Ghaziabad to Ballabhgarh in Haryana. Eventually they were detained from village Hateen in   district of Haryana, where the youth's distant relative resides."
 
 Sharma said that the woman's medical examination was conducted and her statement under section 164 (recording of statement in front of magistrate) of the CrPC was recorded in the court on Thursday.
 
 The disappearance of the couple had wrecked the lives of four families that reside in Sohi village. The members of these families squarely blamed Vahini activists for frequenting their dwellings and threatening them with dire consequences. 
 
 Shakeela Begum, daughter-in-law of Ghulam Ahmad, said, "We were constantly abused and our children were beaten up, only because the youth was from this village."
