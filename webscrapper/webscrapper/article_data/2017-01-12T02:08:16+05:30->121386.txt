LUCKNOW:   patriarch   accused   on Wednesday of hobnobbing with a “rival political party” to engineer a split in SP and claimed that he had already approached the   to register his new party as Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Party and sought motorcycle as its election symbol.

 “Everybody knows who has met the president of another party thrice. I know about their fourth meeting as well,” Mulayam said, adding, “Ram Gopal wants to save his son and daughter-in-law who have landed in a mess. He should have approached me. I would have saved them. But he went to the rivals instead.” There are allegations that Ram Gopal’s family has business dealings with firms linked to the associates of tainted Noida chief engineer Yadav Singh, a charge that has been denied by the politician.
 
 Mulayam said he had warned   about the conspiracy and asked him to stay away but in vain. “I will do whatever it takes to save the party and the symbol and hope you will all support me,” he told party workers at the SP headquarters here.
 
 Playing the emotional father elbowed out by the son, Mulayam told party workers, “I have given up everything I had. What is left with me? All I have is your support.” He said he couldn’t sit back and watch the party fall apart. “Hum kisi bhi qeemat par apni party ki ekta chahte hain (I want to see my party united at any cost),” he said.
