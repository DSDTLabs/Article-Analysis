MHOW: In the wake of recent arrests in connection to espionage network in state, security has been beefed-up in Mhow cantonment and beggars in the area are under army scanner since their numbers have increased here suddenly. 

 As per the sources, based on an input, intelligence agencies officials detained two beggars on Monday and Tuesday. They were under their observation over last few days. One of beggars, who was detained, looked like an athlete. With his physique, it was not possible to find out whether he was a beggar or not.
 
  “I would live in the army area during my service period and after retirement I shifted from there. There were two-three beggars, who could be seen in Mhow town every time. Around 25 years ago also one beggar was detained and after he was released he was never seen in the area,”  , a retired engineer of   told TOI.
 
 Mhow is an important military station since it has three premier training institutions-  ,   and Infantry School. Officers of all the three defence forces undergo in-service courses in Mhow. Also, officers from other countries undergo some training here.
