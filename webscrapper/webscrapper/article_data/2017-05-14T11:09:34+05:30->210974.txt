MUMBAI: A pair of batsmen have achieved something special in local cricket. On May 10, while batting for   against   'A' in the final of the   at the   ground in BKC, 27year-old  , and his 40-year-old partner  , added 185 (off just 87 balls) for the first wicket.

 The Pune-based Shrivastav smashed 140 (17x4, 9x6), with the last 40 runs of his blazing knock coming off merely 10 balls, while his opening partner Singh chipped in with 59 (5x4, 2x6). They separated only after Singh holed out to long on in the 15th over. Shrivastav too was caught behind while trying to smash a yorker in the next over, but their efforts ensured that the Mumbai Customs finished at 254 for four and then restricted MBPT to 167 to win the final and the trophy by 87 runs. Complimenting his partner Shrivastav, Singh said: "He was clearing BKC ground, which is bigger than the   with unbelievable ease, making me jealous of him! "It's more difficult to hit the red ball than the white one. The BPT bowlers were experienced too.
 
 "At one stage, they stationed all the fielders on the boundary, but a bowler complained that 'You can keep putting the fielders in the deep, he'll still clear them)," said Singh, who was a part of the   team, but didn't play any games for them, during the 2009 IPL in South Africa.
