PANAJI:   ( ) and hospital has started charging outstation patients from January 1 and expects to rake in a monthly revenue of Rs 1 crore. Government hospitals in the state have also increased registration fees for patients, one of the contributing factors towards increased income.

 GMC medical superintendent Dr S M   told TOI that since the state's premier hospital started billing non-Goan patients, its earnings have increased. Poor and emergency patients coming from outside Goa, are, however, provided free treatment, as per government decision, he said, adding that they have also been directed to exempt emergency cases from billing.
 
 Bandekar said GMC's revenue collection has steadily increased despite the exemptions . In the first week itself the hospital's collection stood at almost Rs 4 lakh a day.
 
 The power to decide on the emergency nature of a case has been vested with the dean and medical superintendent. "Ranes bold decision will ease the hospital's expense burden," Bandekar said.
 
 During the last few years, GMC's budget has seen an escalation, touching the Rs 400 crore mark.
 
 Bandekar said that as per statistics gathered since January 1, the percentage of non-Goan patients, including those visiting the outpatient departments (OPDs) and those admitted, is 25%. Data also shows that over 30% of the patients visiting casualty are non-Goans. Swiping of the state government's universal mediclaim scheme card -   (DDSSY) - has also been made mandatory for Goans at GMC and district hospitals.
