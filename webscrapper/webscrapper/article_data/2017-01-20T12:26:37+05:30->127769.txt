NASHIK: Promising all steps to ensure free and fair elections, the city police have stepped up   for the civic polls scheduled on February 21. 

 “Police have chalked out plans to keep vigil at the entry points to the city. Hotels and lodges will be on police radar to check for criminals staying there to disrupt the poll process,” said  , deputy commissioner of police.
 
 Police plan to set up ‘nakabandis’ at all the eight entry points to the city. Vehicles, including two-wheelers, would be under the scanner.
 
 “The surprise element will be there. Most of the times meetings in hotels, restaurants and lodgings hold strings to unfair practices in elections. Hence, they will be under the scanner,” the officer said.
 
 “In the past there have been instances when bouncers have been used to deter public. So, bouncers in typical dresses or uniforms will be picked up then and there. The gymnasia and other sanghs have been alerted of possible misuse of their people and have been asked to keep tight check over the movement of the people affiliated to them,” Karale said.
 
 Police have prepared a list of around 270 people who have a track record of creating nuisance during polls. “While some will be summoned to the police station and be asked to maintain peace, the others may be asked to visit the police stations regularly, or may be detained or even debarred from the areas during the election to ensure they are unable to influence the voters,” the officer said.
 
 The police have also decided to conduct a workshop for their personnel to make them aware of the new laws and sections that may be required for enforcements during the elections.
