PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The election to fill up eight standing committee seats was held at the general body (GB) meeting of   (PCMC) recently.

 Eknath Pawar, ruling party leader, PCMC, submitted a list of six corporators to mayor Nitin Kalje during the meeting. Kalje announced the election of BJP corporators Sheetal Shinde, Rahul Jadhav, Vilas Madigeri, Namrata  , Mamata Gaikwad and Sagar Angholikar. Yogesh Behl, opposition leader and group leader of NCP corporators, PCMC, submitted the list of two corporators for nomination to Kalje, who announced their election.
 
 Shinde and Madigeri are old BJP loyalists. Jadhav and Londhe are supporters of BJP associate   while Gaikwad and Angholikar are supporters of Laxman Jagtap, Chinchwad BJP MLA and president of Pimpri Chinchwad unit of BJP. As a result, BJP filled its six vacant seats by maintaining a delicate balance between its three factions, namely those belonging to Laxman Jagtap, Chinchwad BJP MLA and president, Pimpri Chinchwad unit; associate BJP MLA Mahesh Landge and party loyalists.
 
 Mancharkar belongs to Bhausaheb Bhoir group in NCP which defected from Congress and joined NCP before the 2017 municipal elections. Khanolkar is niece of former NCP corporator Manoj Khanolkar. In this way NCP too maintained a delicate balance between the old and newcomers in the party.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Eknath Pawar, ruling party leader, PCMC said, “The core committee of BJP held a meeting in Mumbai yesterday which was attended by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, state president Raosaheb Danve, Pimpri Chinchwad president MLA Laxman Jagtap, myself and others wherein the names were finalised. The names were not considered on the basis of three assembly constituencies of Pimpri, Chinchwad and Bhosari. But the names were finalised considering the development of entire city.”
