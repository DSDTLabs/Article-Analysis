PATNA: An FIR was lodged against an inspector on Saturday with the same police station where he had served as SHO till a month ago.

 Sunil Kumar Paswan, former SHO of   police station in   district, has been charged with accepting money for not taking action against one Upendra Mandal, who was caught in a drunken state on February 22. Paswan, however, is yet to be arrested.
 
 Katihar SP Siddharth Mohan Jain said Mandal, a resident of Paglabari village under Manihari police station, was caught in a drunken state and brought to the police station. He was later sent to sadar hospital for medical examination from where he escaped.
 
 The SP said an investigation by ASP Vishal Sharma revealed that no FIR was lodged against Mandal till February 25 when he was sent to the hospital. “We have taken possession of the medical report. A separate FIR would be lodged against Mandal, who was caught in a drunken state,” the SP added.
 
 Earlier, all the police personnel of Town police station in   were suspended on August 18 last year after 16 persons lost their lives in a hooch tragedy. On February 4 this year, 30 police personnel, including SHO of Beur police station Dhirendra Pandey, were sent to police lines after liquor smugglers were allegedly set free in lieu of money. Later, an FIR was also lodged against two sub-inspectors and a police driver in connection with the case. Pandey was subsequently suspended by the government.
