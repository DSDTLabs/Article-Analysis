SHAHJAHANPUR: A local daily wager who lost her life's savings when an eagle flew away with them received help from a man based 13,000km away in the US. 

 On February 23, an eagle swooped down on Noorjahan as she stepped out of a bank with Rs 20,000 for her daughter's March 5 wedding, and flew away with her purse. 
 
 A news report on the incident caught the attention of Texas resident Usman Khan. Moved, the second-hand car dealer traced Noorjahan through UP police and sent her $500 (Rs 33,000), bringing back on track a wedding almost cancelled.
