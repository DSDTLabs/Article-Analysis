TV actors   and Sanjay Gagnani’s story has all the makings of a digital-age love tale. The two first met five years ago, on a social networking platform. Back then, Poonam was just another Dilli ki kudi, who had no dreams about being an actress. But Sanjay saw the spark in her and asked her to try her luck in Mumbai. Soon, friendship blossomed into love. Sanjay recalls, “We became friends after she arrived in Mumbai. Soon, we graduated to being BFFs. The best part about our relationship is that it has the same passion it had five years ago.”
Poonam says, “There is better understanding when you are from the same profession — overtime, extended shifts, midnight emergencies; nothing needs to be explained or justified. And, we all know that understanding is one of the key ingredients of a successful relationship.” 
 Are they getting married anytime soon? Sanjay answers, “We are focussing on our careers now; we are too young to think about marriage. We both want to do a lot of TV shows and films.”
