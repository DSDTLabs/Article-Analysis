HYDERABAD: It was around 4.30 am in the morning and I was returning from the   after dropping a passenger. While I was returning back to the city, I took a U-turn near pillar number 143 in Attapur. That is when I saw a cloud of   emerge from a shed in the area.

 Initially, I thought that someone was just cooking, but when I went to the site, I saw that an entire showroom had gone up in flames. Since the ceilings and the walls of the shed were made of sheet-metal, they were extremely hot. So my efforts to break open the door went in vain.
 
 When I was trying to pry open the doors, I did hear a few screams, but owing to the smoke their voices were muffled and it was difficult to understand what they were saying. I started looking around frantically to see what I could do to help the people inside. That is when I saw a weigh bridge along the road, where a few trucks were standing.
 
 I went up to one of the truck drivers and asked him to help me break the door open. When he came to the site, even he was unable to open the door, owing to heat it was giving off. But then he told me that he would get his truck and ram it into the door of the shed, hoping that it would break down. In reverse, he sped his truck into the door. It took us as many as seven tries to make a small crevasse in the door. 
 
 It was at this time that the fire department officials also reached the spot. Since they had specialised equipment, the used the crevasse we made and pulled the door down.
