CHENNAI: Calling the blanket ban issued against canvassing through social media for the impending election to the   of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry as arbitrary, an advocate has approached Madras   to quash the prohibition. On March 9, the returning officer for   issued a notice imposing blanket ban and restraining the candidates from issuing manifesto and to canvass through social media for the March 28 elections.

 Advocate V  , assailing the ban, wanted the court to direct the returning officer to upload profiles of the contesting candidates in the website of the council, with information, including their contribution to march of law and criminal antecedents, as done in the general elections.
 
 Noting that the ban is arbitrary and violative of constitutional rights, he said: “The notice issued on March 9 is against well settled principals of law and natural justice. It virtually curtails the ambit and scope of freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a) and 21 of the Constitution,” the petitioner said.
 
 Adding that the notice would only pave way to the erstwhile elected members of the council to get re-elected by virtue of their familiarity with the various bar associations coupled with their popularity, Vasanthakumar said: “If a contestant follows the rules verbatim, they would have to travel the length and breadth of the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in person or send his representatives which involve huge expenses. Furthermore with advent of technology, it is not only fair but also prudent to allow prospective candidates to showcase their respective competence to all the members of the bar via the social media.”
