SHIMLA: With an increase of 10.51% the state   size for fiscal 2018-19 has been proposed at Rs 6,300 crore in  , which is Rs 600 crore more than last year. Chief minister   said this while presiding over the priorities meeting of MLAs from Solan, Sirmaur and Shimla districts on Monday.

 “We are determined to provide clean, effective, transparent and responsive governance to the people of the state and will give priority to information technology and e-governance, so that the vision of Prime Minister   of ‘minimum government and maximum governance’ could be realized,” Thakur said. He said the state government would try to initiate measures to curtail the unproductive expenditure and would try to improve the economic health of the state. 
 
 He said there was need of quality improvement in education by creating more opportunities of employment and self employment. He said there was need for organic natural farming so that farmers and horticulturists could be benefited by the schemes.
 
 He also said MLAs could forward their recommendations for getting works up to Rs 90 crore done by the PWD and   department, the ceiling of which was Rs 80 crore earlier. Jai Ram said the Union government had sanctioned Rs 1,351 crore for setting up of AIIMS at Kothipura in   district while a PGI satellite centre at Una has also been sanctioned at a cost of around Rs 450 crore.
