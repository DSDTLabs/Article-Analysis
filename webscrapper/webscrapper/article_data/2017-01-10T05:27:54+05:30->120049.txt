MUMBAI: Lovers and loathers; Beliebers and  , get ready to let out a collective gasp this May when Canadian pop idol   arrives in India. 

 The voice behind four successful albums and a face mobbed by young girls everywhere since the baby-faced 'Baby' singer arrived on the music scene at 15 will take centrestage at the   in Navi Mumbai on a yet-to-be-decided date between May 10 and 20 as a part of his Purpose World Tour.
 
 Purpose is the fourth studio album of the now heavily tattooed, platinum-blonde haired and pierced ear singer that released in November 2015. With Purpose, which came three years after his last album Believe, the 22-year-old has tried to wipe away his baby-faced teen idol past as much as his involvement in misdemeanours with uplifting messages, piano skills and tropical house numbers.
 
 It remains to be seen if the new and improved 2017 version of Bieber, who took a break from being a bad boy to show his softer side with a new sound, can charm his way back into our hearts. Never say never!
