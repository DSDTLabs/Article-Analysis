 Taking a dig at the schools that have approached the high court opposing the newly introduced Free Regulation Act, limits the fees private schools can charge, the advocate general said that these schools are more interested in minting money rather than imparting education properly. 
 
 The law officer alleged that private schools charged exorbitant fees for imparting education. The lawyer cited various hymns in Sanskrit to make his point.
 
 The state government maintained that education is meant to be imparted free of cost, but private schools are always interested in how much more they can extract from the children.
 
 The high court is hearing numerous petitions by private schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) as well as schools managed by minority institutions, who are all claiming that the fee regulation laws do not apply to them. The private schools have also challenged the validity of the new law.
 
 The state government maintains that it has legislative competence to enact the law and at a time when education is being commercialized, it has a right to impose reasonable restrictions in the public interest.
