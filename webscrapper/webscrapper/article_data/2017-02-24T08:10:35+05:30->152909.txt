LUCKNOW:  , the son of jailed former minister Amarmani Tripathi, was expelled from   on Thursday along with five others for anti-party activities. 

 Amanmani is facing a CBI probe for the alleged murder of his wife Sara and is in judicial custody. He is contesting as an independent candidate from Nautanwa in Maharajganj against SP candidate Kunwar Kaushal Kishore alias Munna Singh.
 
 “The party has expelled Amanmani, his uncle Shyam Narain Tripathi (a former MLA), Sudhir Tripathi, Ajitmani Tripathi and others working against the party candidate,” said SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury. 
 
 Amanmani was initially named as the SP candidate from Nautanwa when Mulayam Singh Yadav was the party’s national president. However, his ticket was cancelled when UP CM Akhilesh took over the reins of the party after the recent feud in the Yadav clan. Earlier, the CBI had registered a case against Amanmani on the recommendation of the CM after Sara’s mother approached the CM with allegations against him. 
 
 Last week, CBI filed a chargesheet against Amanmani for the alleged murder of his wife. Amanmani’s father and four-time MLA Amarmani and mother Madhu Mani are serving life term in connection with the murder of poetess Madhumita Shukla.
