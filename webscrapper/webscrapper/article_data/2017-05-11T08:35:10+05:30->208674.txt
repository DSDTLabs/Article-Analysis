LUCKNOW: Following Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s instructions for a cleaner city in the wake of Lucknow’s dismal rank in the  , the   has decided to   as well. In the first phase, it will be in five marketplaces—Aminabad, Charbagh, Hazratganj, Qaiserbagh and Bhootnath. The areas will be swept after the markets close.

 To start the exercise on ground level, the   officials have spoken to traders’ associations in all the five places. Zonal officers have been instructed to also identify other commercial places where sweeping at night could begin with immediate effect.
 
 The municipal commissioner has also identified 20 garbage dumping spots which will be cleaned thrice a day—at 7am, 12noon and finally at 4pm. These places have been identified on the basis of a survey conducted by RR (rubbish removal) department and LMC’s sanitary inspectors.
 
 These 20 spots include Qaiserbagh bus stop, Aminabad bus stop, dumping ground at Riverbank pumping station, area near Lalit Kala Academy, Krishi Bhawan, Nawal Kishore Road, Hussainganj, Naka and some other spots in Ashiana, Kanpur Road and Old City. 
 
 Besides decision to sweep roads in the night, 1,000 new e-rickshaws have been ordered to cover 5.5 lakh houses in the city under door-to-door collection of garbage. As many as 500 e-rickshaws will be put to use by the end of May.
 
 Action is being taken in the wake of city’s poor performance in Swachh Survekshan-2017 conducted under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. With 269th position out of 434 cities included under the survey, Lucknow’s rank this year fell drastically, as many as 10 times compared to the 2016 survey.
 
 Municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said, “Orders have been issued after talking to officials of all departments concerned. Sanitation work in the city will be on priority.”
