MYSURU: Relief provided by the Supreme Court to the erstwhile Mysuru Royal Family in cases pertaining to attachment of its properties by the Income Tax Department would allow it to focus on other social causes, said   on Thursday.

 “With fewer legal battles to fight, the family will focus on projects close to its heart,” said Pramoda.
 
 She said that the family would now focus on taking up renovation and   of some of the palaces in the city. “We can now focus on taking some of our projects such as our educational institutions to fruition. Two such projects are the restoration of the  , and Rajendra Vilas atop Chamundi Hills,” Pramoda added.
 
 Pointing out that she was personally overseeing the restoration of a section of Jaganmohan Palace that had collapsed, Pramoda said, “I initiated work at the palace using my personal funds. I will restore the structure to its original glory since the relief in the income tax cases has given the family time to focus on other projects and issues.”
 
 She admitted that restoration of   would prove to be a more challenging endeavor. “That requires more funds and greater effort. It needs greater technical supervision, and inputs when compared to the Jaganmohan Palace. Restoration of Rajendra Vilas palace has been going on slowly since the interiors of the palace have glasswork, and we need to be very careful during the process. Scaffolding has been put up for this restoration work,” Pramoda said.
 
 Asked if the family was contemplating turning the palace atop the hills into a hotel, which many erstwhile royal families have done in North India, Pramoda said, “I am an open-minded person. Though many hoteliers have evinced interest in a joint venture, we have not received a concrete proposal.”
