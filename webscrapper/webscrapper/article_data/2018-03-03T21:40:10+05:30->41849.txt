CHENNAI: For nearly two decades, four pieces of artillery used during World War I and II, and in the war of 1971 with Pakistan, have found a home at   in Velachery. Visitors to the college often pass by the four 75/24 Hand Howitzer Indian field guns (IFG), kept in various parts of the campus, and are left guessing about the presence of the canon-like structures.

 Once a powerful weapon, which required the strength of seven members to lift the shells, load and fire just one round, it now stands in a quiet corner. After the Army relinquished use of the 10-km range Hand Howitzer guns for the more advanced Bofors guns with a range of 30km or more, the ministry of defence handed these to   (NCC) Artillery Unit of the   for training purposes after disabling the firing mechanism. Till the early 1990s, these were used by the Army artillery wing for training but with newer models being available, the   Artillery Unit of the Army Wing decided to hand over the Howitzers to Tamil Nadu state wing of the NCC.
 
 
  
  
 "As the artillery has to be guarded, the Army unit wanted a jawan to accompany to be present at the NCC unit within the state which got the Hand Howitzers," said Major I Babu Rathinam, former NCC officer at Guru Nanak College.
 
 Upon assurance of safety from the then president of the college, retired Lieutenant General I S Gill, who was involved in World War-I, the four artillery units were handed over to the NCC Artillery Unit at Guru Nanak College in 1994-95. â€œThe Howitzers are now used only during the Guru Nanak College Annual parade where Army cadets come and teach the NCC cadets how to fire a Hand Howtizer using dummy shells, of course," said Rathinam.
