Madurai: The road dug up for constructing underground drainage system (UGDS) in Manjanakara Street has not been re-laid even though five months have passed since the works were completed. The uneven road is making it difficult for motorists to commute and making the area dusty causing breathing issues for the residents.

 Even the debris accumulated during the UGD works has not been cleared and when there is movement of heavy vehicle, the area becomes dusty and polluted. “We have been waiting for the debris to be cleared from the roadside by the corporation authorities. We also want the road to be re-laid,” said P K Rajammal, a resident of Manjanakara Street.
 
 Although we have approached the officials concerned, we are yet to get any relief, claimed the residents. The issues prevail for about 300 metres in the Manjanakara Street, which is located near Mahal area and comes under Zone Three of Madurai Corporation.
 
 “When we are out in the dust, it causes breathing difficulties. We fear that the prolonged exposure may worsen the problem. Children and elderly people are worst affected by the dust issue,” said J Alagupandi, a resident of Mahal 7th Street.
 
 Residents said that the smaller lanes in the Manjanakara Street, which were laid with paver blocks, are also damaged and the blocks are piled up on the roadside. M Abubacker, who works in a clinic in Seeni Arari Lane said, “The lane had paver blocks, but during the process of laying UGD system, the blocks were removed. The officials are yet to restore it. When it rains, the path becomes muddy and slippery which affects elderly people a lot.”
 
 When contacted, an official from Zone Three said that the contractor left the work incomplete due to financial problem. The contractor has been warned for dragging it for long and he would take up the work soon and complete it, official said.
