New animal slaughter rules have not deterred devotees in Nalbari from booking spaces at the historic Bilbeswar Devalaya in lower Assam for sacrificing buffaloes during Durga Puja.

 Thousands throng the Belsor area in Nalbari every year to witness the ritual animal sacrifice at the 500-year-old temple on Maha Navami. Soaring prices have had an impact on the number of animals sacrificed during the puja across the state over the last decade. Bilbeswar Devalaya, however, has stood out as an exception.
 
 “Till Tuesday, devotees have booked 46 buffaloes for sacrifice at the Bilbeswar Devalaya this Durga Puja. The enthusiasm and devotion of the believers is evident. There seems to have been no impact of the restrictions on cattle slaughter and the market on the turnout,” Utpal Patowary, secretary of the Durga Puja celebrations at the temple, said. The number of buffaloes to be sacrificed this year may surpass previous records.
 
 “There was a time when only 10 buffaloes would be sacrificed here. It has increased manifold over the years. It only goes to show that devotion has no correlation to rules or prices. It is something entirely different,” a resident of the Belsor area, R Barman, said. Continuing with past tradition, several ministers and top bureaucrats have offered buffaloes for sacrifice. The organizers don’t divulge their names of these high-profile devotees to avoid controversy and avoid facing flak from animal rights groups.
