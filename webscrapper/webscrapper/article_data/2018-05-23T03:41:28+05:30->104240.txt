NEW DELHI: The   has convened a special   assembly session from   to discuss   for Delhi. 

 Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced the special session on Twitter and said, “The people of Delhi cannot be denied their rights. I am looking forward to meaningful debates.” 
 
 Since it came to power, the AAP government has been vigorously asking for full statehood. In 2016, it had put out a draft ‘State of Delhi Bill 2016’ in the public domain, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had also hinted at conducting an opinion poll on the same. The key demands were control over Delhi Police, DDA and municipal corporations. 
 
 All political parties have made this promise in the past. “Delhi does not get its due share of the taxes collected; it does not have rights over land, police, and services among others. Some of the limited rights have been taken away as well, so the government is unable to work to its utmost potential,” said a Delhi government official.
