Displayed in all caps, the tagline, 'Revenge is a dish best served cold' makes it amply clear that   is going to be a revenge drama. But what the tagline is actually referring to is a peculiar heart condition that the protagonist Keshava suffers from, confesses  . 'I play a student from  , who suffers from a very rare heart condition because of which his heart is on the right side of the chest. The disease makes him extremely susceptible to stress. He cannot afford to get angry or tensed at all, as even a slight physical or mental exertion can prove fatal. In fact, he can't even run. However, he is on a mission to kill a bunch of people to avenge himself. How he seeks his revenge without getting angry forms the crux of this revenge drama,' discloses the actor.
Helmed by   director,  , this is going to be an 'out-an-out action film' says Nikhil, adding, 'The action in the film will be very stylised on the lines of  's cult classic,  . And you won't see the typical 'robotic action' with unrealistic fights where people are flying some 10 feet in the air. The fight scenes will be very realistic and gritty.'
 Admittedly, he did all the action sequences himself. 'there was no body double; I've done all the fight sequences myself. Fight masters from Bollywood came down to train me and trust me, these fight scenes are the best I've done till date,' says the actor, who's sporting a very rugged look in the film. And, it seems like he's grown quite fond of his beard. 'I'll be sporting a bearded look throughout the film and yes, that's something I'm doing for the first time. It's quite a departure from my chocolate-boy-roles, so I'm avoiding going out much in public. Having said that, I'm enjoying this new look. It's been more than a month that I've been sporting the beard, it itches, but I still have one more month to go till we finish the shooting in January, ' he says, signing off.
