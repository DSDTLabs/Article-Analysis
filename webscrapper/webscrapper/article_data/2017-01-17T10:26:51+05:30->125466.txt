PUNE:  , 31, is taking bold steps on the road to redemption. It has never been smooth sailing for him as a cricketer. Thankfully, he has enough talent, a positive attitude and backers who have kept giving him chances.

 Jadhav scored 120 on Sunday, his second ODI ton, which came after years of struggle. He has no debut 100, had no quick success in the Ranji Trophy, was part of no IPL team in the first season and saw the disbandment of his IPL team Kochi Tuskers Kerala. Yet, he kept on persevering. Jadhav's closest friend Nandan Thakur gave a peek into the batsman's mindset on Monday. “He is an extremely positive person, never accepts defeat. He has reached this stage today because of his attitude.”
 
 Jadhav learnt from his failures and got his rewards. First came a triple hundred from a batsman who appeared to throw away good starts ­ 327 v Uttar Pradesh in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy. Then, a match-winning hundred with   that knocked Mumbai out of the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals in 2013-14.
 
 When he got a chance with   in IPL 2010, he kept wickets and later played the role of a part-time offspinner against New Zealand in the last ODI series. Thakur said Jadhav's family, including three elder sisters, backed him and his cricket. “Guidance and support from Surendra Bhave (former Ranji coach), Sandeep Patil (national selector) and Ajay Shirke (former MCA president) also played a big role in Kedar's journey,” said Thakur.
 
 “Kedar is also very ambitious. He wanted to play for India. He wanted to own a big car. He bought a BMW some years back after working hard for it. Now, he often talks about winning the Ranji Trophy for Maharashtra.”
 
 Thakur, who knows Jadhav for 15 years, said: “Kedar is a generous person by nature. If a needy person wants 10 rupees and Kedar has only 10 rupees in his pocket, he will give it away .“
 
 Destiny takes special care of such people.
