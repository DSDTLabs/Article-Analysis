 “The festival is a 400-year old tradition of this village inhabited by Menaria Brahmins thus giving the village its name. Menar is known for its Holi rituals around this time of the year where the Brahmins play ‘Baroodon-ki-Holi’ to mark their victory over the Mughal army centuries ago,” historian and author Shri Krishna Jugnu said. It is believed that Mughal army had set up a post near Menar village and they plundered and looted the area causing much suffering to the people. 
 
 Rana Udai Singh fought against the Mughals and Menaria Brahmins took up guns and swords to help the king. They captured the Mughal booth and defeated the enemy. The day fell on Jamra Beej which is celebrated till today by the locals to cherish the valour and heroism of their ancestors.
 
 Male participants are dressed in traditional Rajput attire with saffron and red headgears. It is such a cherished occasion that even working youth who may not come home for Diwali holidays, make it a point to visit the village to join Jamra Beej celebrations. Firearms and crackers show which begins around 10 pm continues till wee hours. Later, women pour water on the Holika which symbolises end of the war and turmoil.
