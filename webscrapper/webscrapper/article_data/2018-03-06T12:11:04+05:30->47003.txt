BENGALURU: Private company executive Ajay Kumar’s dream turned real on Monday morning when he completed his otherwise arduous trip from Electronics City to Kempegowda International Airport ( ) in less than 15 minutes.
 
  
 He was one of the nine passengers who were part of the trip in Bengaluru’s first helicopter taxi service, formally launched on Monday by Kerala-based Thumby  . 
  
  
 Kumar, who would normally spend more than two hours to reach KIA, told TOI: “Reaching the airport in 12 minutes was a fantasy till today. I never thought something like this would be possible.”
  
  
 Kumar had a flight to catch at 8am. “The heli-taxi took off at 6.35am from Electronics City and reached KIA at 6.50am. I was ready to board the flight (to Bhubaneswar) at 7am, which is amazing.”
  
  
 It was a memorable journey for Agostino Fernandez and his wife Corrina as well. “Our flight to Goa was at 5.30pm from KIA; we took the heli-taxi from Electronics City at 3.30pm and reached the airport by 3.45pm,” said Agostino. “It’s a great idea to beat traffic and also save time,” he added.
 
 At present, the service is operating between KIA and Electronics City, from 6.30am to 9.30am and 3.15pm to 6.15pm. HAL Airport will be included in the next few weeks.
 
 “We have received overwhelming response from passengers. Some asked us why we didn’t start the service earlier,” said Thumby Aviation chairman and managing director Captain K N G Nair.
 
 “The helipad at Phase I of Electronics City is situated close to the upcoming Metro station and bus station. We are planning to launch services from KIA to luxury hotels, including ITC Gardenia,” said Nair.
 
 The fare is fixed at Rs 4,130 per seat, including GST. It includes pick-up from the airport terminal to the helipad. The cab fare would be range from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Passengers are allowed 15kg luggage and will be charged extra for additional baggage. 
 
 People can book their service through a mobile app named ‘Heli Taxii’.
