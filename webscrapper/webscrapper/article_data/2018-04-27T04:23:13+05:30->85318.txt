MUMBAI: What if the corporates hubs, may of which virtually turn ghost towns after business hours, spring into life as an art and cultural carnival? Or as farmers’ market during weekends?

 In a space starved city, it’s ironical that centrally located areas such as Ballard Estate,   and the Bandra-Kurla Complex are deserted even as Mumbaikars look for recreational places during weekends. So, the new development control and promotional regulation ( ) has authorised the municipal commissioner to suspend reservation of plots temporarily when they are not in use, and use them for farmers’ markets and art-cultural events on the lines of Equal Street. 
 
 Officials said there are various kinds of reservation-designated plots in business areas, mainly parking plots, that are not in use after working hours and during holidays. However, the DCR states that these areas can’t be used for more than four hours during weekends for these activities. The normal functioning of the primary user should not be compromised, the DCR says.
 
 Social activist Anandini Thakoor said the move should be encouraged and such places used as open markets. “It will also help in garbage management. During Sunil Dutt time ( late Congress MP) we suggested similar ideas for some areas in Bandra, but residents of nearby areas were not positive about it.” Welcoming the move, Indrani Malkani, chairman of V Citizens Action Network, said, "Using parking areas in business districts during weekends for farmers market and similar activities is an excellent way of utilizing space which otherwise would remain vacant and unproductive.”
