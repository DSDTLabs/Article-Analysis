MUMBAI: Children trying to balance a book on their heads or jumping a hurdle in their race to the   is a common sight during the   celebration at schools across the country. But, a school in Thane, decided to break the norm and carry a message instead. 

 On January 19 and 20, students of  , Thane celebrated Green Glory- their sports day themed around protecting the environment. 
 
 Hundreds of students of the pre-school used props made by their teachers to drive home a strong message to the audience full of their parents. To spread the message of reduce, reuse and recycle, the students used solar cookers, windmills, trees etc. "The displays which had 750 children performing clearly depicted how man needs to be in harmony with nature for it is we who are disturbing the balance, so beautifully created for us to live happily," said a member of Goenka and Associates Eucational Trust, the management of the school.
 
 Teachers said that the idea was to give every student a chance to participate. "The pre-school students are very young to understand competition so every year we use a theme for our sports day. The school believes in participation and not competition. It was an enriching experience for the children as they were learning on the run," said a teacher.
