  "The rules are yet to be worked out. We will send the proposal to the law and   departments. Once the vetting process is completed, the proposal will move to the cabinet and only then will the orders be issued," said a senior official from the information department. 
 
 The government is trying to ensure that stakeholders are not aggrieved and that the policy, once rolled out, is not challenged in any court of law.
