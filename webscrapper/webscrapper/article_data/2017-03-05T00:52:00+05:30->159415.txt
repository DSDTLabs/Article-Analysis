Mangalore: Mangaluru chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) urged the state government to introduce a single window system for NEET based admission for medical education in Karnataka. 

 IMA delegation led by president Dr Raghavendra Bhat, secretary Dr Kadri Yogesh Bangera, treasurer Dr G K Bhat and Dr Prakash Harishchandra submitted a memorandum in this regard to the chief minister, health minister and medical education minister through the tahshildar here on Saturday. 
 
 Karnataka has highest number of medical colleges in India to its credit. Over 9,000 students pass out from medical colleges every year. At present, through CET 75% of seats are allotted for meritorious students of the state. But over the years, the private medical colleges started their own CET and thereby curbed CET quota. Due to this, social justice in field of medical education has been denied for poor and downtrodden sections of the society, memorandum explained. 
 
 Now according to Supreme Court direction, all the states have to follow centralized system for medical admissions. To uphold the social justice, the Mangaluru chapter urges the government to start a centralized system for admission, the memorandum stated.
