Coimbatore: One of the most commercially important roads in the city, the   also is one of the worst roads. A trip from Vadakovai Junction near Ukkadam area to Gandhipark in R S Puram is not less than a nightmare for motorists. A   greets them every 10m. Some are so huge that accidents are routine. What’s more, the road that has been declared as a one-way, has vehicles travelling from both the sides.

 Last laid 20 years ago, the road has always been riddled with potholes. “The city corporation had dup up the road almost every month for repairing damaged pipelines and laying new ones. In the last two years, it was dug up a dozen times. Every time, construction debris are used to fill up the holes. They don’t even bother to level the road. They can very well do a patchwork using tar. But, even that is not done,” said Sundeep A, a frequent commuter through the stretch.
 
 B Sreenivasan, an auto driver, said that some potholes are very deep and dangerous. “The situation is very dangerous as most of the potholes are located on junctions, posing risk to all vehicles, be it buses, trucks, autos or cars.,” he said, adding that traffic from the opposite direction is not at all checked.
 
 “First, the corporation dug up the road to repair pipeline leakages. Then they dug up long stretches to lay underground drainage pipelines. After that, Siruvani pipelines were replaced,” said Sundar, a shop owner.
 
 Corporation officials said that the pipelines laid on the road were very old and had to be replaced frequently. “But, the stretch belongs to the highways department and they will lay the road,” a corporation official said. Highways department source said funds have been allocated for the purpose.
