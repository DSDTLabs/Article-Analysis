LUCKNOW: In its bid to win an extra seat in  , did BJP unwittingly provide   to attack the party?

 On Saturday, a day after the Rajya Sabha election results were declared, Mayawati attacked BJP, calling it “Dalit-virodhi and garib-virodhi” (anti-Dalit, anti-poor) and referred to the BJP’s ninth candidate, Anil Agarwal, as “dhanna seth” (moneyed trader) who was fielded to defeat a poor Dalit, BSP’s candidate Bhim Rao Ambedkar.
 
 
 Political observers say that Mayawati would use this move by BJP—to field an extra candidate despite not having the required numbers—to take on the saffron party as anti-Dalit and antipoor.
 
 Speaking to the media on Saturday, also emphasized that Ambedkar’s defeat has only strengthened her party’s tie-up with Samajwadi Party. She also took on Prime Minister   and   chief minister   for “ensuring the defeat of a poor and Dalit candidate by a moneyed man.”
 
 “Modi and Yogi governments have misused government machinery to make sure that their ‘dhanna seth’ wins,” said Mayawati.
 
 Political observers say that Mayawati showed political acumen in choosing a Dalit as a candidate and a namesake of the father of the Constitution. “It’s a win-win situation for Mayawati. Even if the candidate lost, she would have got a plank to take on the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election,” said observers.
 
 Sources said there were speculations initially that Mayawati may field her brother   but the decision was changed quite close to the deadline for filing nominations.
 
 As soon as the results were declared on Friday, Yogi attacked Samajwadi Party, calling it opportunistic, but refrained from criticizing the BSP.
 
 During the press conference on Saturday, Mayawati also welcomed Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP)’s Dalit MLA who supported the BSP candidate despite SBSP being an NDA partner in the state and said his “antaratma ki awaaz” (inner voice) led him to vote for BSP.
