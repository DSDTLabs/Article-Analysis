LUDHIANA: A court here on Friday sentenced a drug peddler to 10 years in prison for trafficking 105 grams of “intoxicant powder”.

 The special court of judge   also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on   resident  , 25. The accused, police had claimed in the FIR, used to supply the drug to children in Gurdev Nagar.
 
 Kumar was convicted for being in possession of a commercial quantity of a banned substance. In case he does not pay the fine, Kumar will have to serve an additional six months in prison. On April 17, 2016, Division V police had booked Kumar after finding him in possession of the powder.
 
 At the time Kumar was nabbed, sub-inspector Pawan Kumar and a team of policemen were on a patrol at Gurdev Nagar. They saw Kumar walking towards them. As he turned around on seeing them, the policemen chased the convict down. On checking him, they found him in possession of 105g of powder, which later turned out to be diphenoxylate hydrochloride, which is a centrally active opioid drug of the phenylpiperidine series that is used for the treatment of diarrhea.
 
 During trial of the case, the accused claimed innocence and false implication. He had also sought leniency, saying that he was married and had two children.
 
 The additional public prosecutor for state pleaded for punishment to the accused on the basis of prosecution witnesses and chemical examination report of the recovered consignment (Diphenoxylate hydrochloride) etc.
 
 Defence counsel for the accused had pleaded that the accused was picked up from home instead of the place of recovery shown by police. He added that no independent witness was joined by the police in the case and search was not carried out in presence of gazetted officer.
 
 The court, however, turned down the pleas of the defence counsel and, after taking evidence on record, convicted Kumar.
