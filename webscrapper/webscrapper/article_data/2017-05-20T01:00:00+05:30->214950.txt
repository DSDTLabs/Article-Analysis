Bãhubali director SS Rajamouli’s father,  , who also wrote the script of the blockbuster, is writing the story and screenplay for Raghava Lawrence’s next film, which will be directed by Rajamouli’s associate Mahadev. The film will be made as a bilingual in Tamil and Telugu.

 A source tells us, “It was Vijayendra Prasad who suggested that   will be apt for this film, which is set in two periods in the past — while one portion happens in the 18th century, the other segment will be set in the 19th century.”
 
 “The film will be a commercial action drama, but since this is a period film, we are making it on a grand scale,” says the source and adds that pre-production work on the film is currently underway.
 
 The source also reveals that talks are underway for the heroine’s role. Kajal Aggarwal is rumoured to be in talks, but the team will take a call after a discussion with the actress, who is currently in Europe, shooting for Vijay’s film.
 
 Lawrence is presently writing the script for his directorial and the shoot of this film will start by September, the source informs.
