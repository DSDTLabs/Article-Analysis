 They persuaded mayor Bapu Ghadamode to convene an urgent meeting on the issue. Accordingly, the meeting was held at the mayor’s cabin on Saturday evening where all office bearers of the civic body, senior officers, engineers and others discussed the issue for over two hours. 
 
 Civic authorities, however, said that no change could be brought to the existing water supply network because of lack of manpower and worn-out pipelines. However, the officials in charge of the city’s water supply system failed to come out with a solution that could effectively address the issue.
 
 “When office-bearers asked to improve the system, authorities said it would not be feasible considering available resources. They demanded additional manpower and material to take care of leakages,” said Naser Siddiqui, an MIM group leader who attended the meeting.
 
 He added that the administration said that they were running short of junior engineers at all nine zones in the city. “Apart from this, they also demanded additional technicians and operators at all nine zones,” Siddiqui said.
 
 A senior officer told TOI that the civic body has been running the system with around 25% staff less than when the water utility company was handling the supply.
 
 In the meantime, mayor Bapu Ghadamode stressed on the systematic planning and optimum use of resources. Ghadamode asked the authorities to give priority to filling elevated storage reserviours (ESRs) and repairing leakages.
