NEW DELHI:   minister Arun   on Monday said states are not in favour of bringing petrol and diesel into the   fold at the moment, indicating that the two auto fuels will see periodic adjustments as the Centre and the state governments keep tweaking tax rates.

 
 While GST was rolled out on July 1, real estate as well as crude oil, jet fuel or  , natural gas, diesel and petrol were kept out of its purview. This meant that the products continued to attract duties like central excise and VAT. “So far, the mood of states (most of the states) is not in favour of including it (in GST) at the moment. But I am sure as the GST experience moves on, natural gas, real estate — these are areas which are to be brought in and then probably at some stage we will keep trying for petrol, diesel and potable alcohol,” Jaitley said.
 
 At a post-Budget meeting organised by industry chamber  , the minister also told industrialists that the corporate tax rate can be brought down to the promised 25% only after all the exemptions have been withdrawn. It would not be proper to end exemptions midway as some industries may have been set up based on the concessions, the minister said, referring to his 2015 promise of paring the rate from 30% to 25% along with the withdrawal of all exemptions.
 
 While the benefit of a lower levy has been provided for all companies with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore and covered nearly 99% of the companies, the average effective rate for the remaining 7,000-odd companies worked out to 22%, after factoring in the exemptions available to them, he said.
