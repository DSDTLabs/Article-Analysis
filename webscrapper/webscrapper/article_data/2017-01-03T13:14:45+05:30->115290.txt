MUMBAI: A 25-year-old man from Vikhroli was arrested on Sunday for allegedly attacking a 20-year-old man and four of his friends with a knife and stealing his cellphone in Powai very early on  . Three of his accomplices are on the run. 

 The police said that the arrested accused, identified only as Pandey, and his three friends waylaid Aakash Ovhal (20) who was on a bike in   locality. The accused attacked Ovhal before snatching his cellphone.
 
 On spotting Ovhal being beaten up, his friends-Kailash Badarge, Nitin Gache, Vikas Diwar and Akshay Sonawane-rushed to his rescue. The four accused also attacked Ovhal's four friends, said the police. 
 
 Badarge has an injury on the abdomen while Gache has severely injured the face. Diwar has a injury on the back while Sonawane has sustained injuries on the ears. The four have been admitted to a municipal hospital.
 
 Senior inspector of Powai police station, Bhai Mahadeshwar, claimed that the accused persons are known to Ovhal and his friends. "They committed the offence over past rivalry," said Mahadeshwar. 
 
 However, Diwar'sbrother, Virendra, refuted the police claim. "My brother and his friends are not known to the attackers. They first heard about them only when the police tracked down one of them and arrested him. The police's claim about rivalry of the past is a baseless allegation," Virendra told TOI. 
 
 The police are on the lookout for the absconding accused, all of whom live in Vikhroli and a team has been deployed to nab them.
