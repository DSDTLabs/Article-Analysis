MANGALURU: Preparations are underway for the commencement of the second phase of Shiradi Ghat development works on the   stretch of the Mangaluru-Bengaluru route.

 Contractors—Ocean Constructions India Private Limited – have already procured all necessary equipment and materials to commence the work. A total Rs 85.28 crore was sanctioned to develop the highway from   to Addahole on the Mangaluru-Bengaluru route in 2015. Out of Rs 85.28 crore, Rs 63.10 crore has been earmarked for concreting 12.38 km of the road, and Rs 22.18 crore will be used for asphaltation of a stretch of 21 km. 
 
 The contractors, who had completed the first phase of work, have imported a new concrete road paver machine from Germany. Sources in the company said they have bought the machine for Rs 10 crore. The company has a machine worth Rs 7.5 crore, which was bought when the first phase works commenced a couple of years back. In addition, the company also procured nearly 50% of the required raw materials, including sand and aggregate (gravel). Due to the new road paver machine, the works can be expedited, said sources.
