Thereâ€™s nothing like some foot-tapping music to help one unwind! And this was quite evident at this new swish hangout joint in town, where we spotted almost all present unable to resist shaking a leg. Some even left their food to groove to the music, returning later to finish their starters and dinners.

 Many of the young ones present also caught up with each other, chatting over drinks and yapping loudly above the sound of music. And though everyone was quite nattily dressed, a special mention goes to Ashwini, whose colourful headgear and lipstick added a sartorial punch to the evening.
