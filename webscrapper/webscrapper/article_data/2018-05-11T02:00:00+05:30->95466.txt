PATNA: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Patna director Prof Pushpak Bhattacharyya has been nominated by the ministry of external affairs on the panel of the   conference slated to be held in Delhi on June 14.

 This fifth panel discussion will be on the theme, ‘Indian Diaspora's Role in Capacity Building of Artificial Intelligence in India’. 
 
 Prof Bhattacharyya said on Thursday it was an honour to be part of this event as it would be an opportunity to hear the talented Indians doing well in the artificial intelligence field abroad.
 
 “The goal is to have a dialogue between domain experts from India and those abroad, and how they can work together to benefit India,” he said and added the discussion would be summarised into concrete policy recommendations for the government.
 
 Asked how the panel discussion would help IIT-Patna, Prof Bhattacharyya said the institute would get external collaborative projects that may attract faculty members doing research in artificial intelligence.
 
 Prof Bhattacharyya was earlier appointed the chairman of the committee for standardisation in artificial intelligence set up by the Bureau of Indian Standards under the ministry of consumer affairs.
