MUMBAI : BMC has told Bombay high court it wants   next to the mayor’s bungalow at   back from a vacant land tenant for “the noble cause” of building a   for the late Shiv Sena chief Bal  .

 BMC’s reply was filed after Keraleeya Mahila Samaj moved court last year challenging the March 26, 2016 vacant land tenancy (VLT) termination notice and the HC on April 15, 2016, in an interim order, had directed “no coercive action’’ shall be taken against it.
 
 The notice to the Samaj said the government decided to develop the Swargiya Balasaheb Thackerary Smarak at the adjoining mayor’s bungalow, including 574 sq metres land in its possession. It directed it to “to quit, vacate and deliver” peaceful possession of the property within 30 days, failing which it will take possession of it. It also said an equivalent of 81 sq metres of the structure on site will be given as alternative accommodation. The Samaj’s petition said it is a charitable organization running a free nursery school, and culture and art classes.
 
 BMC’s March 3, 2017 reply said the notice was based on the original allotment of April 10, 1957 and a temporary 25-year lease had ended. It said the land was reserved in the development plan for a recreation ground, and hence a permanent lease cannot be executed in favour of the Samaj. Also, the plot was “required by the respondent corporation for the noble cause as mentioned in the said letter (notice).”
 
 On April 26, a bench headed by Justice Patil was disinclined to continue relief for the Samaj. Its advocate, Mahesh Menon, argued, “Having resolved the site issue (for the memorial), there is no reason to take my premises. We should not be thrown out.” Senior advocate Milind Sathe, representing BMC, said it was part of the mayor’s bungalow and BMC must be allowed to take steps in accordance with law. “If it includes coercive action, we will take it,’’ he added.
 
 The bench said both must “sit and solve the problem’’.An order is likely on May 2.
