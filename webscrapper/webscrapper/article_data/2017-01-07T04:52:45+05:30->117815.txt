NEW DELHI: Air India has enhanced   for passengers flying between Delhi and Mumbai on its newly-launched   747 service to 40kg and 50 kg for economy and business classes, respectively.

 Currently, AI allows 25kg of free check-in baggage in economy class and 35kg in business class compared to 15 kg offered by other airlines.
 
 AI recently started operating two daily flights of its jumbo jet on the   route and two on the   route. The B-747 flights are in addition to the numerous other flights AI operates between Delhi and Mumbai on its narrow body   A-320 fleet.
 
 AI Jumbo Jets, at present being used for   long haul flights of the President, vicepresident and PM, have operated on the Delhi-Mumbai route earlier too but those flights were as part of an international routing — Delhi-Mumbai-London or Mumbai-Delhi-New York (via London), for instance.
 
 These flights used to be in the early hours of the day — usually between midnight and 5am. Tickets on the domestic leg of these flights used to be sold cheap, making them the first low cost flight for budget flyers in India.
 
 “Passengers flying on Delhi-Mumbai route will have an opportunity to experience flying the airlines’ legendary ‘Queen of the Skies’ and can avail this facility from Saturday (Jan 7),” an AI statement said. “AI is the only carrier to operate the 423-seater jumbo jet wide body B-747 on India’s busiest route.”
