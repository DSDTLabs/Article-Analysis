NEW DELHI: The cyber cell has arrested an MBA graduate and his associate for cheating several people of crores by offering investment schemes of a fictitious company ' ' and then converting them to a self-made crypto-currency ' '. 

 Joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar, said the 'currency' priced at Rs.3.50 per coin would come with a promise of a high profit. "When customers later enquired, they found that nothing named RHF coins existed nor was it a valid form of transaction," he said. 
 
 The crooks, Ashish Malik and Sandeep Kaushik used to operate from Punjab and targeted investors from across the country. They had floated the company along with another associate Sunil Singh Chauhan. However, it was later found that no such company was recognised by the Registrar of companies in India. 
 
 Cops received a complaint from Ravinder Pal Saini, a resident of Karnal who was duped of lakhs by the gang. A team led by DCP Bhisham Singh including inspector Sandeep Malhotra tracked down the source where the money was delivered and reached Malik and Kaushik. Initially they tried to mislead the cops, but later confessed to have duped several people.
 
 Probe revealed that Malik met Kaushik in Gurgoan, who in turn introduced him to Chauhan. All three formed a company 'Virtual Crypto currency/Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)' in 2016 and used their contacts to extend the business. They initially launched Rosneft hedge fund, and thereafter, virtual   'RHF Coin/RHF Gold' last year.
