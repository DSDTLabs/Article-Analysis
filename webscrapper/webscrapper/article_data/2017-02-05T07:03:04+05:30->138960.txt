LUCKNOW: Becoming the state’s first university in doing so, Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University ( ) will have a garden made especially for the differently abled. Spread over 21,780 sq ft, the   is being designed to help   students understand the scientific aspects of plants.

 “The sensory garden will comprise all medicinal, aromatic plants, including herbs, spices, thornless and economically important plants, set up with the help of renowned taxonomists (experts who put plants into separate categories),” said SMNRU vice-chancellor Nishith Rai. Work on the garden is to begin this June.
 
 Rai said the garden would have special features, keeping in mind specific needs of the differently abled, like be handrails, scented and edible plants, sculptures, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, magnifying glass screens and   and audio induction loop descriptions that would be accessible to all. Braille signboards and tactile signals in the garden will direct the visually impaired to plants, he added.
 
 He said the garden will have scientific and common names of the plants and other description given in Braille and audio form. There will be a provision of audio guides, like a Braille plate with an audio pen by touching which a visually impaired student can listen to the description of the plant, he added.
 
 The V-C said in the sensory garden, plants and other design elements would be selected with the intention to provide experiences for heightened sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste. 
 
 “Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to address the needs of younger users,”said the V-C. The garden would also have ramps to permit wheelchair access.
