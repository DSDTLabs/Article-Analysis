ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Punjab government has listed   founder and mastermind of the Mumbai terror attacks, Hafiz Muhammad  , and four other members of his Jamaat-ud Dawa under the fourth schedule of the Anti-Terror Act, Dawn newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 Saeed’s close aide Qazi   has also been listed under the fourth schedule, which is meant for individuals who are found to be or suspected to be involved in anti-state activities and terrorism. 
 
 Delivering hate speeches is also a crime that attracts inclusion in the fourth schedule. The move is a big departure as till now, Pakistan has officially denied Saeed’s role in terror activities even though he was recently placed under house arrest and on the exit control list following pressure from the Trump administration. 
 
 The Dawn report, quoting a senior police officer, said the counter-terrorism department (CTD) had added the names of Saeed and Kashif to the list of the 1,450 “fourth schedulers” on the orders of the federal home ministry. The other three JuD members on the list are Abdullah Obaid,   and Abdur Rehman Abid.
 
 The five men, according to the home ministry, were identified as active members of the JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat (FiF), JuD’s charity wing. The report said the federal home ministry directed the counter-terrorism department (CTD) to “move and take necessary action” against them. 
 
 Despite India’s attempts at his extradition and an Interpol notice against him, Saeed has been detained and released in Pakistan several times in the past. In 2012, the US even announced a bounty of $10 million on Saeed for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. 
 
 Earlier this year, on January 30, when Pakistan placed Saeed under house arrest in Lahore, the move was lauded by the military, which has been accused of using him and his terror group as strategic assets and proxies against India.
