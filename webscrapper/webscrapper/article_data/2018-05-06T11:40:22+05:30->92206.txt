At a time when the capital city of   –Raipur – is scorching under 44 degree Celsius temperature, a youth-based organisation –The Local– know for organising events on dance and drama took a rather different route. Members of the organisation recently gathered at one of the busiest streets in   –Ghadi Chowk–where they provided the commuters with tetra packs of buttermilk and umbrella shade till they waited in the signal. As many as 50 youngsters provide respite to the commuters for hours. 
 “The gesture may be very simple, but our aim is to touch many souls with this random act of kindness,” informs one of the organisers   adding, “We shall continue this work in other areas too.”
 As part of this event, members of The Local also provided buttermilk packs to traffic police, who are working under the sun.
