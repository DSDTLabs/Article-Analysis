Salem: A one-year-old toddler died of a mysterious fever at the Mettur government hospital on Wednesday. The relatives of the child claimed that he died of dengue. 

 The deceased has been identified as R Sriram, son of K Ramesh, 32, of Acchankadu near Mettur.
 
 The father admitted the toddler at a private hospital in Mettur on July 20. But toddler condition did not improve even after days of treatment. “He has been suffering from a mysterious fever for the last two weeks,” Ramesh said. 
 
 As the toddler’s condition started deteriorating, doctors from the private hospital advised his father to shift the toddler to the Mettur government hospital. Based on this, the father admitted his son to the government hospital on Wednesday. “He was admitted at the children's ward on Wednesday. He died around 8pm,” Ramesh said. 
 
 When contacted by TOI, health department officials denied dengue allegations. They said that it could be a viral fever. "We have sent two medical teams to conduct health camps at Acchankadu village," the officials said.
