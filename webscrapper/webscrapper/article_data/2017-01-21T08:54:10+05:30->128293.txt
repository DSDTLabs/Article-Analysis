SILCHAR: The North Cachar Hills Indigenous Students' Forum (NCHISF) on Friday gheraoed the   (NCHAC) office at  , headquarters of   district, demanding immediate release of compensation for families affected by the laying of broad gauge tracks across the hill district. 

 The agitation, led by NCHISF president Devid Kevom, continued from morning to evening. NCHISF members reportedly didn't allow council officials and employees to leave the office well after their period of duty was over. The stalemate continued till the evening. However, the agitation passed off peacefully, a senior police officer said.
 
 An NCHISF member said 500 families and 300 hectares of land were affected by the construction of broad gauge railway line through the hill district by the   (NFR). The route between Lumding and Silchar was opened for railway traffic in November, 2015. The NCHSIF member added that despite NFR's assurances, the affected families are yet to receive compensation.
 
 Last year, NCHISF and senior railways officials had met at Maligaon to discuss the issue, the NCHSIF member said. "At this meeting, we had set a deadline of two months to sort out the matter - that is, till January 24. After this, we will call an indefinite Dima Hasao bandh if the compensation is not paid," the NCHISF member added.
