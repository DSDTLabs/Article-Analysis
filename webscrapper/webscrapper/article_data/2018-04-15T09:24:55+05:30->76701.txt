LUDHIANA: Officials of the   (LIT) are planning to give a new lease of life to one of its much talked about projects — the   in   — but this time they will construct flats for the middle income group (MIG). The department had to drop this project last year, when it could not receive much response due to high rates of the luxury flats. Officials claimed they would send fresh designs for approval from the government to allow them to construct flats at affordable rates.

 The project had been hanging fire since 2010-11, when the trust announced the construction of over 450 flats in 8.8 acres of land. The foundation stone for the project was laid in 2011 by the then local bodies minister  . But the work did not start for long until LIT organized a draw for the allotment of flats in December 2016. The department allotted flats to 110 allottees, but since the cost of one luxury flat was Rs 65 lakh, 80 allottees deposited only a partial amount.
 
 Moreover, when allottees did not deposit money in the bank, the bank authorities deducted Rs 3 crore from LIT’s account. Due to all this, LIT decided to drop the project in August 2017, and informed the remaining allottees about the project status. The department had almost fulfilled all formalities for the project, and they had also received an NOC from the   (PPCB) in May last year.
 
 LIT’s superintending engineer   said: “We are planning to reduce the size of flats from 2,400 square metres to 1,200 square metres, so that the medium income group invest in them. One flat would then cost only around Rs 45 lakh.” He said they had received preliminary approval from the government, and now they would redesign the scheme.
 
 However, sources revealed that officials were planning this project from a fresh angle, because the site allocated for the flats was gradually turning into a garbage dump. Moreover, LIT was not running any project in the city, except funding a few projects for the municipal corporation.
