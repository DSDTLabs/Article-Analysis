NAGPUR:   loves scoring, both on the basketball court and off it. A student of Ambedkar College, Shreya scored 95.38% despite being busy with national-level basketball competitions right throughout the academic session. 

 
 
 
 She won best player award on many occasions. During an important academic year, Shreya represented Maharashtra in as many as five national basketball championships and state championships in the U-18 and in the open category. She also played in many all India invitational tournaments and brought laurels to her club,  . 
 
 “My parents expected that I would get good marks because I did well in Std XI too but I didn’t expect to fare so well and that too on the city level,” said Shreya. She aims to become an IAS officer because of the respect commanded by civil servants in society. She will pursue her graduation in BCom or BA. 
 
 Shreya said it took a lot of sacrifice in other activities so that she could practice up to eight hours a day. “The trick is to remain fresh mentally even after being physically exhausted,” she said. 
 
 It was her dream to be a topper and she realized that it would be very difficult for her to fulfil it as she hardly got any time to dedicate towards studies due to her rigorous practice schedule. Just three days before the board exam she was playing in an All India Mayors Cup tournament where the Nagpur team finished runners-up.
 
 Shreya’s father wanted her to take science and become a doctor, but she wanted to dedicate time for practice and represent the country in basketball so she chose commerce over science. She wanted to make her father proud by scoring good marks in her chosen field and she did so with élan.
