Shimla: A day after chief minister Virbhadra Singh refused to wear the maroon colour cap presented to him by state health minister Kaul Singh Thakur, BJP leaders on Thursday described the act as an insult to the people of the state.

 BJP’s MP from Hamirpur, Anurag Thakur said that Virbhadra had refused the honour extended to him at the function by refusing the maroon cap. The issue here is not just about not wearing a cap but Virbhadra has continuously neglected the interests of people living in lower Himachal, he said. Virbhadra has always differentiated between lower and upper Himachal, the BJP leader alleged.
 
 BJP’s chief spokesperson Dr Rajeev Bindal said that Virbhadra’s “cap gesture” revealed his and the Congress party’s divisive politics. A maroon cap is not a BJP symbol and that Virbhadra was playing politics (by refusing to wear the maroon cap) after telling his own partymen in the assembly to wear maroon caps.
 
 Kullu MLA Maheshwar Singh claimed that the chief minister had insulted the people of the state by dumping the cap on the stage. “Irrespective of its (cap) colour, Virbhadra should have worn it with honour,” he said. The MLA demanded that Virbhadra apologize for his act.
