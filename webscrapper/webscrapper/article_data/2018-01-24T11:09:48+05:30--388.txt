LUCKNOW: Dacoits have been changing their strategy as they have been striking frequently without fear, using heavy fire during attack, not dithering from killing people and evading arrest thereby instilling terror and panic among people.

  is not new to people living in rural areas, towns and on outskirts of the city. With time, audacity of criminal gangs has increased. While robberies have been witnessed for past several years, the way criminals are killing people is what has left police worried.
 
 Armed dacoits have targeted seven houses in Chinhat, Kakori and   in the past four days, killed two men and left a dozen injured.
 
 Such violence was witnessed earlier on September 11, 2015 when more than a dozen men wielding iron rods and guns robbed three houses in Yogidham colony of Jankipuram Extension after killing a youth.
 
 “Earlier we had never seen assailants opening such heavy fire like this. We feel extremely vulnerable and helpless,” said Anuj Shukla, a resident of Jankinagar, Malihabad.
 
 “We have no option but to form keep watch in groups and be out with lathis and torches. Those who have firearms also join,” said Ramgopal Yadav, a politician active in Malihabad block, after back-to-back dacoities.
 
 “As soon as heat rises in Lucknow, the gangs shift to neighbouring districts. These criminals can never be caught without coordinated efforts. Under pressure, police officials arrest random criminals and pin responsibility on them. However, such crime will only come down if the actual gang is nabbed,” said high court advocate Pranshu Agarwal.
 
 City police claimed to have worked out the Jankipuram case after few members of ‘Nat’ and ‘Kalandar’ tribes were arrested by Siddharthnagar district police. However, it seems that actual criminals were not nabbed and they have started striking with vengeance again.
