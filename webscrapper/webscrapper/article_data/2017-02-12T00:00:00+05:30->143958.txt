It’s that time of the year again when you are looking for ideas on how to make your significant other feel special. And nothing says ‘I love you’ more than a heart-shaped bauble. Come   and   sales go up. As jewellery designer   says, “Usually it’s pieces that speak of romance and love, that can be worn everyday rather than statement pieces, as they are meant to be daily and constant reminders of love.” Her picks: necklaces, bracelets and rings over bangles or earrings. Jewellery designer   now sees a trend of women buying jewellery for themselves rather than waiting for someone to gift them.

 
 
 Heart-shaped jewellery is booming – be it in cuts of diamonds or as design inspirations. Pittie forecasts that charm bracelets and inscription jewellery — pieces shaped in your name or inscribed with a love quote — will see a rise in sales. Inscriptions could be names or even adjectives or moods. Promise rings are also getting popular now. 
 
 Ahluwalia feels nothing says love more than rose gold. “For women, two-name necklaces in different languages are popular (with the names joined together with a heart or an infinity sign),” she says. 
 
 
 Use Valentine’s Day to pamper your man. Now, most men are averse to wearing jewellery, but few can resist a great watch. Invest in a timeless watch for him and maybe inscribe it with a favourite love quote. Ahluwalia says you can go for monogram cuff-links too. But don’t force it on him.
