BENGALURU: Rubbishing exit polls findings that have predicted a hung assembly in  ,   president BS  , who has set May 17 as the date for his swearing-in as the next chief minister, on Sunday said his party will get 125 to 130 seats.

 
 “I will meet PM   and   on Tuesday, soon after the results, in New Delhi, to fix the time for my swearing-in ceremony on May 17,” Yeddyurappa said.
 
 BJP national president too has said that his party will form the next government in Karnataka. “The BJP will form the government in Karnataka on May 15 evening after the results,” a PTI report quoted Shah as saying at a party workers meet in Panaji.
 
 Yeddyurappa said he has enough years of experience in politics to judge and his calculations have never gone awry in his long political career. “I will give it in writing that BJP will get absolute majority. You can verify it once the results are out,” he added.
 
 Yeddyurappa’s confidence in fixing oath ceremony date had been earlier dismissed by chief minister Siddaramaiah as a “dream”. Siddaramaiah even called his rival a mentally disturbed man.
 
 On Siddaramaiah’s “mentally disturbed” remarks about him, he said Siddaramaiah knew his time was over.
