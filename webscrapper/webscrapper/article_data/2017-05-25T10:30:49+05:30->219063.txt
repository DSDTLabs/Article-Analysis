KOLHAPUR: The district agriculture department will be organising the   (progressive farming campaign) from May 25 to June 8, 2017 to create awareness on various government schemes available for farmers. 

 District information officer  , said, “Agriculture department regularly organises various programmes for development of agriculture sector and welfare of farming community. The government has decided to double farmers income by 2022. To increase the farm productivity, the department has decided to organise Unnat Sheti Abhiyan for a fortnight starting from May 25 to June 08, 2017. We have organised various programmes at village level. We want to make farmers aware of the government schemes available for them. We have appealed farmers to participate in this initiative.”
 
 Anil Patil, a farmer from karveer taluka, said, “Generally, farmers are not aware about various schemes that are available for them, such as marketing trends or crop pattern loans, due to which they remain at bay from main stream agricultural sector. Organic farming is a popular trend in farming. We normally follow the organic methods to grow crops. But farmers are not aware that they can earn respectable money from diverse methods. Agriculture department should start awareness about organic farming.”
 
 Another farmer  , said, “The department has taken a good initiative for the betterment of farmers. But the government should take efforts at policy level to double the income for farming community. We should get assured prices for our products. Agriculture has become an uncertain business.”
