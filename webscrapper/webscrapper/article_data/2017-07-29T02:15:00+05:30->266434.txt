Amaravati: The Andhra Pradesh government will soon enter into an agreement with companies based in   on the   bull.

 A team of businessmen from Brazil met speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao on Friday to explore the possibility of breeding Ongole bulls. He explained the importance of Ongole bulls to them.
 
 It may be recalled that the original Ongole bull had become the proverbial goose that laid the golden egg. The Brazilians sought the permission of the Chennai-based National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) to take the germ plasm (semen) of the bull to their country from India.
