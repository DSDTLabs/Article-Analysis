KOLHAPUR: Citizens are likely to face water scarcity on Tuesday as the civic administration has failed to complete the work of repairing the leakage in the main pipeline supplying water to A, B and E wards.

 On Monday, Kolhapur   kept the operations of the pumping stations on hold after the electricity board stopped the power supply to the stations due to technical works. In order to avoid causing inconvenience to the citizens, the civic body decided to carry out the repair work on the same day and accordingly deployed technical staff. 
 
 Though the electricity board completed its work and resumed the power supply,   was unable to complete the repair work by evening. The work was still in progress and likely to be complete by midnight.
 
 The pipeline is damaged at Chambukhadi. Leakages were reported a couple of months ago but repair works could not be carried out due to lack of funds.
 
 A senior KMC official requesting anonymity said, “The repair work was a critical one and therefore could not be completed on time. However, we are making sure the pumping starts from atleast some of the water lifting stations. The areas which were affected on Monday will receive water by Tuesday afternoon.”
 
 On Monday, areas like Tarabai Park, Kadamwadi, Jadhavwadi, Rajarampuri and some suburbs did not receive water and had to depend on water tankers. Seven water tankers supplied water to 27 areas. Water from filter houses located at   and   was used to fill the tankers. 
 
 Officials said some of the high-rise water tanks will be filled by Tuesday morning and temporary changes in the water supply schedule would be initiated so that the areas running completely dry receive some water.
