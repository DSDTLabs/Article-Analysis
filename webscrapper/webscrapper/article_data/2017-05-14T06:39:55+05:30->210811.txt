BATHINDA: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from   Baljinder Kaur has accused the   of making false claims of disbanding the   (constituency) in charge. She alleged the defeated leaders from the Congress were calling the shots in their respective constituencies and working in undemocratic way, just as it was with the Akali leaders under the previous SAD government.

 Baljinder has now written a letter to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to stop the practice and make the officials give due weightage to the elected representatives or she would raise the issue in the coming budget session of the state assembly.
 
 Talking to newspersons at Bathinda on Saturday, she said, “The ground reality is even worse than the previous SAD regime as the Congress leaders have started interfering in the administration within less than two months of the formation of the government. Even the officials are forced to listen to the Congress leaders.”
 
 She alleged that Congress leader   was patronizing the truck union at Rama Mandi in Talwandi Sabo near the Guru   refinery. The henchmen of Congress leaders were openly demanding ‘goonda’ tax from the truckers going inside refinery with building material, she claimed, adding, “The henchmen even are threatening truckers with dire consequences if they refuse to pay up and have damaged trucks in the past.”
 
 “Against the stated policy of the government, Congress leaders are holding meetings with officials and interfering in their working,” she alleged.
 
 On the other hand, Congress leader Jattana, who lost from Talwandi Sabo constituency to Baljinder, refuted the charges. He said, “These are baseless allegations as I never interfered in the official work neither did patronize any truck union.”
