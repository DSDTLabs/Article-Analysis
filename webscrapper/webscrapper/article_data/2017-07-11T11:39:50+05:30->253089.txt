PANAJI: The Goa bench of the Bombay high court on Monday issued notices to central and state government on a petition seeking a probe into BJP national president Amit Shah’s alleged illegal public meeting at the high-security precincts of   airport, Dabolim, soon after his arrival to the state on July 1.

 The high court has sought replies from civil aviation secretary, Goa chief secretary, the director general of police (DGP), the airport director and the deputy commandant of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) within three weeks.
 
 The petitioner, advocate  , had sought directions to ensure “the rule of law is upheld by holding an inquiry to fix responsibility and take action in accordance with law against the organisers and those responsible for that illegal public meeting held within the precincts of Dabolim Airport”, allegedly in total violation of the law. 
 
 He had further stated that it was probably the first time ever that a public meeting was organised by a political party within the area of an airport and had submitted photos of the meet. The BJP, which organised the meeting, had claimed that necessary permissions were obtained while also stating the meeting was spontaneous, the petition read.
