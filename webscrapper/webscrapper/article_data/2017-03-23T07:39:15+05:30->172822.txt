CHENNAI: Cab customers may be in for some more pampering as there is a new kid on the block. 

 'Qik', the latest entrant, promises to be a 'driver-centric' app, junking the   which is a major bone of contention between existing cab aggregators and drivers. 
 
 "The aggregator model is a clear failure in India. Cab companies started with many incentives but could not sustain them over a period of time. It has left drivers who are working 18-20 hours a day dissatisfied, with 30% of their earnings going away as commission," says city-based Joseph Kamalesh, co-founder of TenZillion Cabs along with Suvro Ghosh. 
 
 The company will be launching the new app in the city next month before launching it in other cities in the state like Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy and Salem.
 
 Qik will work on a subscription basis, by which drivers pay a monthly fee to the company and take home whatever is earned through the day without having to part with commission fees. 
 
 "We will also be fitting in IoT (Internet of Things) enabled services to check the engines, oil and emissions, besides which drivers will be entitled to medical insurance and legal aid for a nominal monthly fee," adds Joseph.
 
 The app aims at roping in   and   drivers in the city who, under the banner of the 'Friends Drivers Welfare Association of TN', have been protesting the alleged unfair practices of aggregators and demanding a standard per kilometer fare. 
 
 "Current cab pricing may be convenient for passengers, but comes at a big cost for drivers who have families to feed. We hope our tie-up with Qik will get us out of the tangle of dynamic pricing, and the steep number of rides we have to clock in daily," says Tamil Arasu, president of the association.
 
 The company will also provide women with safety features on the app, through panic buttons and combination hard keys that will send alerts to the nearest police station and nearby cabs.
