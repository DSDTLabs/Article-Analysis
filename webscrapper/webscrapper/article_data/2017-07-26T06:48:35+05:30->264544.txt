CHENNAI: In a relief for two private dairy producers which, along with several others, faced allegations of adulteration from the state milk and dairy development minister, the Madras high court on Tuesday passed an interim order restraining the state government and authorities of Aavin from drawing samples of products of the two firms for testing till further orders. Justice M Duraiswamy passed the order on two separate pleas moved by   and Vijay Dairy and Farm Products Private Limited. 

 According to the petitioners, after the establishment of Food Safety and   (FSSA) in 2006, all private milk producers were brought under its jurisdiction and the state government’s role in governing such producers was ended. “While the fact being so, the state government authorities and the officials of Aavin which functions directly under the control of the state dairy development ministry are conducting inspections and collecting samples of the products produced by us claiming that the samples would be used for laboratory analysis to check for adulteration. 
 
 When Aavin as a milk producer is a direct competitor of the petitioners and other private players, such inspections conducted by officials should be construed illegal,” the petitioners said. They wanted the   to restrain the authorities from conducting inspections and collecting samples and interfering into their lawful business activities. 
 
 Though officials of Aavin or the state government do not possess any supervisory powers over private players, the industry as a whole is being subjected to some amount of harassment by officials purely for the sake of hampering the sales and marketing of private dairy brands with a view to improve the sales of Aavin, the petitioners added.
 
 Claiming that they were always willing to subject themselves to lawful testing by the designated authorities under the FSSA (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India), they wanted the high court to restrain the state authorities from conducting inspections and collecting samples and interfering into their lawful business activities.
 
 When the petitions came up for hearing, the judge granted the interim relief and adjourned the pleas by a week for the government to file a counter
