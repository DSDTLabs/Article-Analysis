IMPHAL: All activities came to a grinding halt in Imphal on Saturday owing to a total shutdown called by the Coordinating Committee (CorCom) of some underground outfits to denounce Prime Minister  's visit. 

 The bandh, however, had little impact on the rally as thousands of BJP workers and well-wishers from across the state turned up at the   ground in   where the Prime Minister gave his speech amid heavy security.
 
 The statewide bandh began at 6am and remained in place till Modi left the state. Businesses establishments in   market in Imphal city were closed. Interstate passenger buses and public transport vehicles were off the roads. Attendance in almost all government offices was thin. 
 
 All shops, except a few medicine stores which were kept outside the purview of the bandh, were closed. Other essential services were exempted from the shutdown which also did not affect flights.
 
 The CorCom accused Modi, the head of the Indian government, of drafting policies to suppress the people of Manipur.
 
 The organization, which comprises several rebel groups and is fighting to restore Manipur's past independence, had called on the people to boycott Modi's visit. 
 
 Police and paramilitary forces were posted in strategic areas in the state capital in view of the bandh and the high-profile visit.
