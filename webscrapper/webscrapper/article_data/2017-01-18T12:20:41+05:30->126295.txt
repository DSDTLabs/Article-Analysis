No matter what your hair type is, you need to use a hair vitaliser to regain your mane's strength and quality.

 
 
 Beautician Nishi Nanda says, "Similar to hair oil, a hair vitaliser contains ayurvedic herbs that enhances the growth of hair and also stimulates the scalp. However, to ensure that you get optimum results, it is always advisable to choose a vitaliser that suits your hair type."
 
 
 
 
 Those who have oily scalp and experience dandruff issues, a hair vitaliser that contains bhringraj is ideal for you. You can also opt for one that has shikakai in it to boost hair growth and reduction of excess sebum from scalp.
 
 
  This vitaliser is ideal for those who have a normal hair type - not too oily nor too dry. Apart from keeping your scalp clean, it also ensures that your hair does not lose out on its sheen.
 
 
  This combination is good for those who have dry hair. Amla keeps the hair and scalp moisturised, while lemon ensures that the scalp does not experience dandruff problems.
 
 
 
 1) it keeps your hair shining and strong 
 2) can be made easily at home if you have the ingredients at hand 
 3) can be used in place of a hair oil or for better results, can also be used along with a hair oil. 
 4) since it is herbal and natural, you can apply it more than once a week 
 5) if followed by a hot towel treatment, your hair quality starts improving within weeks
