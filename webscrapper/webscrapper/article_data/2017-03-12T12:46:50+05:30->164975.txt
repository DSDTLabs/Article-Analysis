Director James Cameron said that 'Avatar' sequels are put on hold again. 

 The 62-year-old filmmaker said doing the sequels are not an easy task as he is working on four films instead of just one. "Well, 2018 is not happening. We haven't announced a firm release date," Cameron told. 
 
  
  
 "What people have to understand is that this is a cadence of releases. So, we're not making 'Avatar 2', we're making Avatar 2, 3, 4, and 5. It's an epic undertaking. It's not unlike building the Three Gorges dam," he added. 
 
 But the director assured fans that he is working hard, saying, "We're full-tilt boogie right now."
