SALEM:   district SP P Rajan said on Monday that the emerald Siva   case would soon be transferred to the idol wing. "The idol wing is short on staff and thus we helped wing inspector general A G Pon Manickavel to arrest the thieves," he said. On Saturday, the idol wing had seized an emerald Siva idol weighing 7kg and worth 25crore from a five-member gang near   in Salem. 

 Meanwhile, R Aswini, 24, daughter of R Valli, 49, who was arrested in the case, claimed that the police had seized only a green stone idol and not an emerald one. Talking to the media, Aswini, said that she had got the idol tested. "The test revealed that it is not emerald. It is just a green stone idol. It's worth a few thousand rupees and not 25crore," she said. 
 
 Valli's advocate Suruli Vel also said that the police wrongly arrested Valli and her gang. "The police must withdraw the case and release the arrested people at the earliest," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, SP P Rajan said that an expert team has come to Salem from Chennai to examine the idol. "The experts will certify whether the idol is emerald," the SP said.
