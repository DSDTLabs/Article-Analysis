NEW DELHI: The Medical Council of India (MCI) had made an announcement to debar candidates who completed their Class 12 through open and distance mode from attending National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ( ). 

 The MCI, in a letter sent to the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), said that NIOS students would not be on a par with those from the regular mode and they would be ineligible for NEET.
 
 The NIOS approched the HRD ministry to intervene and prevent thousands of capable students from missing the opportunity to make a career in medical field. 
 
 The HRD minister Prakash Javadekar held an important meeting on the issue on Wednesday, January 18. After the meeting, the Centre decided to revert the MCI's order to prevent NIOS students from appearing in the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) this year.
 
 As per sources, the HRD ministry has taken the decision in favour of the students and opposed the MCI's move.
