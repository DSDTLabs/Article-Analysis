MUMBAI:   on Saturday busted a   from   that broke into a Borivli (East) store last month and escaped with Rs 5 lakh cash and 267 mobile phones worth Rs 76.13 lakh. 

 The police arrested Abdul Shaikh (36), kingpin of the gang, from a construction site in   where the gang was hiding after the burglary. They had entered Hari Om Custom Collection in Borivli (East) by drilling a hole in the roof using screw-drivers. 
 
 The gang planned to sell the mobile phones in Bangladesh or Nepal. However, they changed their plan of leaving the city when they read in newspapers that police had got their photos from the shop’s   camera. The CCTV was connected to the complainant, Shantibhai Satara’s mobile phone through an app. On June 27, when Satara opened his shop, he found it ransacked. The CCTV footage showed four men with faces covered drop down into the shop after making a hole in the roof. 
 
 “The gang only stole mobiles. They did not leave the city fearing of getting caught after they learnt that police have identified them and are on their look out,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone XII) Vinaykumar Rathod. Police have recovered 235 mobile phones worth Rs52.5 lakh.
 
 “Shaikh was earlier arrested by the crime branch, DB Marg police and Kalamboli police in 2014 and he came out of jail recently,” said an investigator.
