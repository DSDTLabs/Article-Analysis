A busy corporate event calendar in 2015 may have fuel led the growth of upscale, luxury hotels in Cyberabad, but the picture is not too rosy today . Most luxury hotels in the city's IT hub are now marked by low year-round occupancy rates and few bookings, say industry insiders.The reason: changing travel trends in the corporate sector. “A bulk of the upscale and economy hotels in city are concentrated in the Cyberabad region. The trend in business travelling has changed in recent years, with people now preferring to travel to other cities only when absolutely necessary .Even tourists who come to Hyderabad book hotels according to a shoestring budget. The five-star hotel culture is slowly fading,“ said MV Rajeshwar Rao, CEO of Confederation Of   (Credai).

 According to a report titled `Hotels in India -Trends and Opportunities', published by Gurgaon-based hotel research company HVS, the supply increase in city in terms of the number of rooms is witnessing a gradual slowdown. Only around 1,500 hotel rooms will be added to the city by 2020, the report said. The proposed growth in the luxury hotels segment has been pegged at 0%.
 
 This is backed by city-based industry experts, who say that the budget or economy and `mid-market' hotels are the ventures that hold promise.“Looking at the condition of the luxury hotels in Cyberabad, developers in this segment might not take the risk of spending a bomb. In the next three years, it will be mostly smaller properties such as mid-market and three-star hotels that will come up in Cyberabad,“ said Pradeep Dutt, secretary general of Hotels and Restaurants Association, Telangana.
 
 With the interest in bed and breakfast accommodations growing, the ministry of tourism had put forward a scheme to boost the sector. “ Although there are many people interested in homestays and bed & breakfast establishments in Hyderabad, the scheme needs to be marketed better to gain more traction,“ said an official in charge of the scheme.
