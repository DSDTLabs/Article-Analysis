MUMBAI: Four months after a Pune man was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for raping a minor, the Bombay high court has suspended the jail term.

 Justice Anant   observed that the sexual relations appeared to be the outcome of their affair and ordered Sandeep Patil's release on bail of Rs 15,000. Sandeep was 20 years when the alleged incident occurred while the girl was 16 years and nine months old. “Evidence of the victim goes to show that a young man and a young woman were deeply in love and indulged in sexual relations, which was the outcome of their love affair,“ said Justice Badar.
 
 “(Her) evidence does not show that there was any act of violence at the instance of the accused. There seems to be no criminal antecedents of the accused. On the contrary, she has stated that because of their acquaintance the intimacy between them developed,“ added the judge.The court has restrained Sandeep from any manner trying to contact the victim or threatening or intimidating her.
 
 The complaint was lodged by Seema on November 30, 2014 at Chinchwad police station. According to the FIR, Sandeep had raped her by falsely promising marriage and got her pregnant. He had subsequently refused to marry her. A sessions court in December 2016, held Sandeep guilty of rape and for offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.   and  , counsel for Sandeep, urged the court to suspend the sentence and release him on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. Additional public prosecutor   opposed the application and contended that the victim was below 18 years and the DNA test results was proof of the offence. The HC pointed out that Seema had revealed that she and Sandeep were in love.
