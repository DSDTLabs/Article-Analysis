The next time you visit your favourite katta in  , don't be surprised if you find a police man/woman hanging out with students. The city police have come up with a new initiative that aims to break the ice become more approachable to students. In about a week, every police station in the city will select a   (or two) to liason with the schools and colleges under their jurisdiction. These kakas will visit campuses on a regular basis and students can simply walk up to them for a casual interaction. In addition, their numbers will be circulated among students and displayed on campus and in school/college buses too. 

 By creating single points of contact between students and the law, this project aims at increasing safety in schools and colleges. Students will be able to share grievances, learn about the law and the consequences of breaking it and seek guidance by interacting with these kakas, who will be from the rank of a constable and above. Students who have heard about the project, feel that it might be a strp in the right direction. “We’l be able to resolve small issues which otherwise would require us to visit a police station. Hopefully, it puts an end to problems like eve teasing too,” says Sachin Asha Subhash, a student from Sinhagad college.
 
 Besides issues like eve-teasing, stalking and ragging, other problems like narcotics and cyber crimes too need to be addressed on campus. “Most of the victims and accused in narcotics and cyber crime cases are youngsters. This initiative will prevent students from falling victim or being accused in such cases. Confidence in the police force will motivate them to share valuable information with us, that can enable quick response during emergencies. Students who approach us will remain anonymous,” Pankaj Ghode, a cyber expert who has worked on this concept for the Pune city police.
