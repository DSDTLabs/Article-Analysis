BATHINDA: Two days after the bank heist at   village,   on Friday released another   of a suspected accused in the case. The footage shows a man riding a motorcycle, stolen on the day of the robbery, in Muktsar town. Another clip shows the man, wearing a long blue kurta and a white headscarf, going towards the bike. 

 On May 3, six masked men had robbed Rs 10.27 lakh in cash and 50 gram gold from the State Bank of India branch at Sarawa Bodla. Police officials said the person in the two video grabs could be one of the six who struck at the bank.
 
 Police had on Thursday released the CCTV footage of persons who were allegedly involved in the bank robbery. 
 
 Malout superintendent of police (SP)  , under whose jurisdiction Sarawa Bodla falls, said police had minutely watched the CCTV footage and the man may have stolen a black bike from Muktsar the same day. “The person seems to have similar clothes (as in the footage released on Thursday). Police are trying to match more similarities and exploring the angle that the man whose face is visible could be one of the robbers,” he said.
