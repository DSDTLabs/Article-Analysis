CHENNAI: He lost his vision, lost his school years, but   made up for all that by acing his   at the age of 19 to score 480 marks out of 500. Selvan had to relearn how to live as he was blinded in one eye in an accident and his other eye’s vision deteriorating. He had to cope with the partial disability and continues to have low vision in one eye. 

 When he was 8, he dropped out of school. “I had to take a four-year break from school and I couldn’t recollect anything from what was taught to me since kindergarten,” said Tamil Selvan who is now a student of St Louis Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Adyar. “I had to start from scratch and also had to learn to read and write in Braille and use a scribe.”
 
 Selvan comes from a poor family with his father,   working round-the-clock as a steel polisher. “I had to go through many operations since the time I met with the accident, so my father started working the whole day without taking any breaks in order to pay my hospital fee,” says Selvan. “My parents have fully taken care of me to supported me. For the board exams, my father got me a mobile speaker which plays out loud mathematics problems. It helped me learn faster."
 
 Selvan is also a chess player and has won medals in three district level chess competitions. An anonymous donor has also been helping the teenager through the school for the past two years. Selvan dreams of being a civil servant and will be preparing for the IAS examinations after completing school. His dream it to be identified as an IAS officer in the future, he says.
 
 Selvan, prefers group studying more, as he feels that it’s more relaxing and makes him happy while studying and easier to recall later. “I will always try to understand what I study. I don’t sit and study for hours. Mostly I observe and understand while my teachers teach. I love my subjects and respect them while studying,” he adds.
