New Delhi: India’s largest pizza retail chain Domino’s has struck off pork pepperoni pizzas from its menu, citing lack of demand from consumers and unavailability of good quality meat. Its rival Pizza Hut, too, has relegated the sale of pork pepperoni pizzas to a few states.

 
 Many non-vegetarian consumers have expressed dismay at the sudden pork pepperoni crunch. There has also been speculation about whether the decision was motivated by the religious sensibilities of some customers.
 
 “We are facing a few issues with respect to the supply of right quality materials,” said a spokesperson for Jubilant Foodworks, the franchisee for Domino’s Pizza in India. “Hence, we have had to put this product temporarily on hold. We are actively working on the same and hope to sort it out soon. Earlier, we had even stopped selling cheese burst pizzas but brought it back because consumers were asking for it.”
 
 For others, it is business as usual. “We haven’t faced any problems with supply of pork pepperoni,” said Vicky  , culinary director for  . “In fact, it’s one of our best-selling pizzas.”
 
 
 
 Ratnani said, as an ingredient for pizzas, pepperoni is more expensive than chicken and can bring down margins for pizza makers. “Sometimes, it also boils down to whether you are importing the pepperoni or sourcing it from India,” he said. “Imported pepperoni is far superior to what we get here.”
 
 When asked about the source of its pork pepperoni, Domino’s said it sources the product from   certified suppliers but did not elaborate on the quality issues it is currently facing with the ingredient. Other industry experts said religious sentiments pertaining to certain varities of meat are more likely to influence the choice of menu for restaurant chains that have a pan-India presence.
 
 “Pork is not a staple in most places in India apart from maybe Goa and the  ,” said   of Technopak.
