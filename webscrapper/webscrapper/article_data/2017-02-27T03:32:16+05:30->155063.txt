ROHTAK: Buoyed by the massive response on Sunday to its call for a‘black day’, the All India   (AIJASS) on Sunday announced its decision to not celebrate Holi. 

 Donning black ‘chunnis’, turbans, and bands, the Jat protesters—including elders and women—reached the Jassia sit-in in tractor trolleys, raising the demand for Jat reservation. Large crowds of protesters— including supporters of controversial godman Rampal-—coming from villages across the district, laid siege to National Highway-71A from Rohtak to Gohana. The operations at Makdoli toll plaza were suspended, making it a free run for the sit-in bound vehicles. 
 
 Attempting to target the business community, Jat leader Yashpal Malik asked the protesters to refrain from shopping from establishments not carrying the message for Jat demands. Attacking the BJP government for not accepting their demand for withdrawal of criminal cases, Malik asked if the ruling regime was so serious about upholding the law of the land, then why was action not taken against BJP workers in the past 12 months. “BJP workers were directly involved in triggering tension and attack on the Jat community, but action against them has been missing, and the government pretends to have no knowledge about it,” alleged Malik. 
 
 Appealing to protesters to be ready for a Delhi siege, Malik said the date to surround Parliament would be announced on March 2. and Jats from Delhi and UP would protest at Jantar Mantar. He said it would be a day after Holi, and the protesters would lay siege to National Highway-1 (Sonipat-Delhi), 10 (Rohtak-Delhi), and 8 (Rewari-Delhi). He said: “About 50,000 protesters would enter Delhi on March 2, and five crore after Holi, leaving no space for others on that day.”
