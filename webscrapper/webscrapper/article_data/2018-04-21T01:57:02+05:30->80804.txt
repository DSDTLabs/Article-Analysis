GURUGRAM:   is all set to revamp   collection. 

 After terminating the contract with  , the firm which conducted the survey of properties in  , the civic body is now developing a software for error-free property tax calculation and verification. The property owners can also make corrections on their own by logging in with their respective IDs. It is expected to be launched by May 15.
 
 MCG chief   said the performance of the firm was reviewed in the wake of a TOI report and it was found that there were irregularities to some extent. 
 
 “Around 90% errors in the survey conducted by MapmyIndia were related to names and addresses of property owners and only 6 to 7% were regarding property tax calculation,” he added.
 
 However, it was decided that the corporation will develop software in its own GIS lab and make the property tax calculation and collection process transparent, he added. The software will make the entire property tax calculation and collection process paperless, and give the property owner the right to make minor corrections related to name and address and review the tax collection on their own by logging in with their respective IDs. 
 
 The new software will have an option for property tax calculation and it will be available online. The property owner can view the property details and the calculation. He can check the calculations and if satisfied, he can make the payments online. In case he is not satisfied with the calculation, he can raise the grievance and make the payments as per his calculation. 
 
 “It will be more interactive and hassle-free process, the property owners will correct names, address and other details related to the property. They need not take rounds of the MCG office and thus it will save man hours and increase the efficiency of the staff which is otherwise consumed in public dealing,” said another senior official.
