PUNE: Bishop of Poona Thomas   on Thursday said evils in society will end only when there is a change in the mind and heart. 

 “There are so many legal provisions, so much education, so much material progress and economic emancipation, such strict penal measures and law and order machinery. Even so, crimes do not stop. Women are harassed, colossal frauds, brutal murders, huge tax evasions have become endemic,” he said in his Good Friday message.
 
 “The holy and moving observance of   calls upon us to transform our minds and hearts,” Dabre said.
