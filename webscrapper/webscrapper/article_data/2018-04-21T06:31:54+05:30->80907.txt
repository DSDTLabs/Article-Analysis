 From the 70th batch passing out from   ( ) here, he is perhaps the first visually challenged officer joining income tax department through Indian Revenue Services (IRS) cadre. The officers join the department as assistant commissioners (income tax).
 
 Simhachalam, who hails from East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, prefers not to speak much about himself, saying unnecessary sympathy can only leave people feeling demeaned about themselves.
 
 “I am only a BA, and come from an economically backward but emotionally rich family that has always supported me. Instead of myself, I would rather say how one can overcome any kind of disability,” he said.
 
 “Any person needs three factors to deal with a disability. First is the human factor, which means support from the family and friends, followed by use of technology like scanners, listening devices, and so on. These can make work easier. The last is attitude. There has to be a positive attitude towards such persons from others. The disabled person himself needs to be optimistic,” he said.
 
 Simhachalam said government circulars call for providing aid to a disabled person. He said he may need a personal assistant during his service in the department. The need of a personal assistant increases as responsibility increases as an officer, he said.
