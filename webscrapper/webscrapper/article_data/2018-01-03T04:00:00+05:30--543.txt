Rajkot: A Veraval-based fish exporter was kidnapped at gunpoint near Prabhas Patan police chowki on Tuesday allegedly by a group of persons who were demanding Rs 10 lakh as extortion amount from him. Last year on December 18, exporter Haroon Panja, who owns Asian Impex factory in Veraval GIDC, had submitted an application to the police alleging that Sadiq Jhaga and his aides barged into his office and threatened his son Kasif demanding Rs 10 lakh ransom. “On December 17, I had gone to Rajkot. My son Kasif was at the factory when Sadiq Abdul Jhaga and seven-eight others came there and asked for me. When Kasif told them that I was in Rajkot, they asked him to keep Rs 10 lakh ready the next day. They threatened to kill me and Kasif if we did not pay up,” Panja stated in his application. Panja said the gang again came to his factory on December 18 and asked for money. When Kasif asked them the reason for extortion, Sadiq brandished a pistol and took away Rs 1.45 lakh kept in the drawer. Sadiq then asked Kasif to keep Rs 8.5 lakh ready. However, on Tuesday, Sadiq and his associates intercepted Panja near Prabhas Patan police chowki and kidnapped him at gunpoint. After Kasif informed the police, cops have barricaded major roads of the district to nab the culprits.
