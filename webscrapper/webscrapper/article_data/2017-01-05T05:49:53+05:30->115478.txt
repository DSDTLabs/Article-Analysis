CHENNAI:   may connect a part of Anna Salai underground from Teynampet to Saidapet much before the mid-2018 deadline, if work on the rest of the stretch leading to May Day Park is not completed on time.   said they will decide soon on whether to open a part of the underground line along Anna Salai or to commission the entire 7-km line at one go.

 As of now, officials are looking at getting the 7.3-km stretch from May Day Park to Saidapet with six stations for launch by the middle of next year. Work on this underground line in corridor 1 was stalled for more than a year after a   abandoned the project in May 2015.
 
 Metro rail officials said tunneling work is complete on the 3.3-km stretch from AG-DMS to Saidapet and station work is underway. This small underground stretch, which will connect to   via Little Mount, may open first, metro rail sources said, though the plan is to open the entire Anna Salai underground line at the same time. Officials said that tunneling work is still underway in the 4-km line from May Day Park to AG-DMS.
 
 “The tunnel boring machine has neared Thousand Lights and is just one station away from AG-DMS,” an official said. Work to complete the stations under the arterial road is simultaneously underway.
 
 After the Russian contractor abandoned work midway, the Anna Salai underground line was split into two and tenders were floated to complete the rest of the work. Larsen and Toubro bagged the contract to complete the stalled construction in the stretch between AG-DMS and Saidapet. In June 2016, Afcons Infrastructure, an Indian construction group, bagged the contract to complete tunneling work in the remaining stretch of about four km from May Day Park to AG-DMS.
