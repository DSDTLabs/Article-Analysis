LUCKNOW: A large part of   number 6 of   is taken by material for construction of a shed and   fear for their lives as they cross that section. The area left to walk on is barely enough for old citizens, handicapped or women carrying children, especially when the platform gets crowded at the time of arrivals and departure. Vendors too have to move too find it hard to cross that section.

 Passengers complained that while crossing this patch they were scared they might fall on the tracks, while the dust flying from the construction activity is another health hazard. 
 
 A frequent travel between Lucknow and New Delhi, Deepti Srivastava said, “I was crossing this section when a cycle rickshaw full of parcels arrived at the same spot and I lost my balance and was nearly thrown off the platform. I was so scared to realise I might have fallen on the tracks.” 
 
 Another passenger Aradhna Bajwa, carrying a child in her arms had a similar experience. “My four-year-old son tugged at my stole and I lost control but thankfully, some fellow passengers helped me on the spur of the moment, or I would have been on tracks,” said Aradhana.
 
 When TOI enquired, most officials, including the station mamager were unaware of what was going on. Later, after enquiring from assistants, he got back to explain what the construction activity was for.
