Pune: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader   on Thursday dubbed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s day-long fast a “farce” and an attempt to gain sympathy.

 The BJP will not gain anything from this “farce” as people have made up their minds for a change, he said while addressing a media conference here.
 
 Pawar referred to a video clip that went viral on social media in which the BJP’s two MLAs — Bhimrao Tapkir and Sanjay alias Bala Bhegde — were filmed snacking on sandwiches and chips and “breaking” their fast mid-way during a meeting at the council hall here, being held under the chairmanship of Pune district guardian minister Girish Bapat.
 
 Tapkir agreed that he munched on some chips during the meeting but it was “unintentional”, he said. 
 
 “I am not denying that I had some chips. But it was not intentional,” Tapkir said. 
 
 BJP’s city unit president Yogesh Gogawale said, “None of the party’s workers or leaders at the venue called off the fast midway. If any such incidence has been reported outside the venue, I am not aware of it,” he said.
