CHENNAI: On the eve of  's visit to Chennai, the political climate hotted up with a war of attrition between   leader   and   state president Tamilisai Soundararajan. Vaiko accused the PM of being a "coward", scared of facing the agitated people of Tamil Nadu with the opposition planning a massive black flag protest against him, and taking the aerial route for travelling within Chennai. Tamilisai took to Twitter to respond to Vaiko's charge and said, Modi was daring enough to have an unscheduled landing "even in Pakistan." 

 Vaiko took Modi head on and said that the country had not seen a PM like him. "He is a coward. Does waving black flag mean shooting him? You (Modi) are becoming a (Benito) Mussolini; afraid of black flags. Take the roads if you are brave enough, but you won't," the MDMK leader said, amid cheers from his supporters in Chennai Airport. Wasting no time, Tamilisai took a dig at Vaiko for criticising the "protocol" followed for the constitutional authority. Recalling the LTTE sympathiser slipping into Sri Lanka illegally by boat in the past, the leader asked, "Isn't that cowardice?" This is the second visit by Modi to Chennai ever since uproar erupted over the failure of Centre in setting up Cauvery management board ( ). Despite unanimous resolution by the legislative assembly, Modi continues to rule out an audience for an all party-delegation.
