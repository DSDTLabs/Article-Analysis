MUMBAI: A special   court in Delhi on Monday granted bail to   in connection with the INX Media bribery case. The special judge   observed that   was arrested on April 26 and sent to judicial custody on March 31. But with 60 days having lapsed since his arrest, the statutory period available with   to file its chargesheet had ended, the court observed. 

 Once the chargesheet is not filed before the statutory period, an accused is entitled to statutory or "default" bail on that ground alone, when the minimum sentence is less than 10 years and maximum sentence attracted for the alleged offence is not life imprisonment or death, said his lawyer  .
 
 The law gives time to a probe agency to investigate and file its report to disclose charges against the accused. Peter has been made co-accused with wife   in the alleged conspiracy of cheating and criminal misconduct under Prevention of Corruption Act. Both are co-accused in the   case too. The murder trial resumes after a break on Tuesday in a Mumbai court. 
 
 The CBI had opposed Peter's bail, saying the chargesheet could not be filed "due to non-cooperation of the accused." The court rejected CBI's submission saying that in applications for default bail, merits cannot be gone into.
