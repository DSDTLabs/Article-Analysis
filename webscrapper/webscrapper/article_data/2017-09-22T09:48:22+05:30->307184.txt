AMRITSAR: A   police commando posted with AAP's candidate for the Gurdaspur   by-election, Maj General Suresh   (retd), opened indiscriminate fire near Khajuria's home in   early Thursday morning.

 Constable Lakhwinder Singh, apparently suffering from hallucinations, fired as many as 28 rounds from his self-loading rife (SLR) before he was overpowered by Khajuria and other guards. No one was injured in the random shooting because the commando started hallucinating around 4.30am and luckily no was there in the street. Some vehicles were damaged and walls of neighbours' homes pockmarked with bullets.
 
 When Pathankot SSP Vivek Sheel Soni questioned Lakhwinder, he said that he opened fire because he felt as if a large mob had started attacking him. He later said that he also felt as if he had fallen into a pit of snakes and that the snakes had entlimbs.
 
 The police have registered an FIR against Lakhwinder, who was with the 2nd Com mando Battalion. A senior police officer told TOI that the constable was made to go through a medical examination after the shooting.
 
 Psychiatrist Dr Sonia Mishra, who examined the cop said, “Schizophrenics experience hallucinations and delusions, but so do persons with any kind of substance dependence.“
 
 Mishra said Lakhwinder's medical history shows that he has been mentally unstable for more than five years.
 
 A relative of Khajuria, Sandeep Dogra, said Lakhwinder, who was deployed outside, came running towards Khajuria's house while firing from his rifle.
 
 “When he ran out of bullets, he put his gun on a table, took his bag and was about to go back again when Khajuria, his driver and couple of residents caught him,“ he said.
