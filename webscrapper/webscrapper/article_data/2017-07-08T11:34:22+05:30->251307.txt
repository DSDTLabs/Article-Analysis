When they came out of the Trivandrum domestic terminal, their faces glistened with joy. For the 58   who had their first aerial journey from   to the capital, it turned out to be an experience to cherish. Some were nervous about their first flight while others were beaming from ear to ear. The children were selected from schools in Idukki, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Cherthala and Thrissur under the Rotary project ‘Wings of Life’ season 3. 

 Gesticulating and smiling were Nihil, Akash, Vyshak, Anu and Shyfna, speech and hearing impaired kids from Kalady. Though they had a translator in sister Grace Mary, their cheerful countenances spoke volumes. Vyshak was teasing his friends Nihil and Akash, who grabbed his arms when the flight took off from Nedumbassery. Said Jovin, about the clouds that came so close to the window: “I wish I could catch the puffy clouds and take them back with me.”
 
 After a hearty reception at the airport by the chairperson of  , Shobha Koshy, they were off to the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo. After a sumptuous sadya from a city restaurant, the kids returned to Ernakulam by road.
