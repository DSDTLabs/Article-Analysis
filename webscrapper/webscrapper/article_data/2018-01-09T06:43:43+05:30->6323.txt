KOLKATA: A dramatic shift in the nature of air cargo in the past couple of years has forced   to augment the handling area by converting a section of the old international terminal into a cargo facility. 

 On Monday, around 3,000 sq metre was added to the existing 39,150 sq metre facility in the air-cargo terminal when private courier firm   commenced operations in the arrival area of the terminal that was decommissioned in 2013 when the intergrated terminal came into being.
 
 An airport official said e-commerce had redefined the concept of air cargo. "Earlier, weight was the most important criteria. That is not so in domestic cargo. With e-commerce, the average package weighs considerably less. But the number of packages that are being shipped has exploded. Thus in revenue terms, there is a healthy growth though it may stagnate or even dip if one goes by the conventional calculation of weight," he said.
 
 Blue Dart managing director Tulsi Nowlakha Mirchandaney said the company's operations also reflected this metamorphosis in air cargo. "The average weight of packages that we ship has reduced to a fifth while we are carrying five times more packages. Consequently, the freighter that flies in and out of Kolkata is going full," she said.
 
 The city airport handles about 250 tonne of domestic and international cargo a day. While that is less than half of what Delhi or Mumbai handles, it is becoming crucial for meeting the growing demand for e-commerce goods ordered from cities in the east and north-east.
 
 The cargo movement has been witnessing a surge in festive seasons and when e-commerce firms like   and   offer maga discounts. "While Blue Dart handles around 25-26 tonne cargo in its dedicated freighter on an average, during these festive and bumper sale occasions, the cargo goes up to 28-30 tonne," a source said.
