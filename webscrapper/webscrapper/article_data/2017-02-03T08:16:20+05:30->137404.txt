PUNE: The   police on Thursday arrested a 20-year-old autorickshaw driver for bludgeoning a 22-year-old man to death over an old enmity.

 The incident occurred late on Tuesday night at Narhe. The suspect, Dhayari resident  , revealed during interrogation that he killed   of Narhe because the latter had threatened to kill him a few days ago.
 
 Assistant inspector Devendra Shinde said, Kadam went to Dhayari on Tuesday night to discuss his cousin’s marriage with the sister of the complainant, Aakash Chinchole. After the discussions, Kadam’s relatives left, but Kadam stayed back. “Around the same time, Pandule came to meet Chinchole. Pandule and Chinchole were friends,” Shinde said.
 
 Few days ago, Pandule and Kadam had fought over some petty issue. At that time, Pandule had threatened Kadam with dire consequences. “Seeing Pandule there, Kadam thought Pandule had come to kill him. He picked up the shock absorber of a vehicle lying outside Chinchole’s house and bludgeoned Pandule. The impact was such that Pandule suffered severe head injuries,” Shinde said.
 
 Shinde said the victim was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to injuries on Wednesday night. “Kadam fled the spot, but we arrested him on Thursday,” Shinde said.
