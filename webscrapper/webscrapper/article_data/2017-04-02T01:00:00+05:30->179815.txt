A few days after actress   filed an FIR against  , producer of the TV show ' ', accusing him of sexual harassment, the producer duo Sanjay and Binaifer have hit back by filing a criminal defamation case against her. Says a source, “Binaifer and Sanjay have enough proof to counter Shilpa’s claims in the FIR, which will be contested in court.” Refusing to divulge the details of the legal action taken by her, Binaifer maintains, “Let the law take its course.”

 Recently, there were reports that Shilpa has also filed a defamation case against   (Indian Film and TV Producers Council),   (Cine and TV Artists Association) and FWICE (Federation of Western India Cine Employees) claiming that the three federations dissuaded their members from working with her.
 
 However,  , co-chairman IFTPC says, “We haven’t received any notice from the actress yet. Our future course of action will be decided by our legal advisors once we receive the copy.” Regarding the ongoing feud between the Bhabiji producers and the actress, he says, “We will support our member (Sanjay and Binaifer), who brought the issue to our notice. Neither the actress nor her association (CINTAA) has approached us with the issue yet. And as Binaifer told us that if there was an incident of sexual harassment, why wasn’t it raised last year? In fact, the actress continued visiting the set and sending text messages to her. So, there is no reason for us to not support our member in the harassment case.”
 
 Shilpa chose not to comment on the news.
