AMARAVATI: In yet another major decision which is likely to kick up a storm, the council of ministers has approved the new land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement bill. The cabinet will table the draft bill in the state assembly for approval and will send it for the President's ascent after which the new law will take effect. 

 The cabinet, at its meeting held on December 31, 2016, decided to model the new law on the lines of the Gujarat land acquisition act, 2016. At its latest meeting on Wednesday, the cabinet felt the proposed law will ensure fair compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement to the people affected by the project. "With the proposed law, land acquisition for all the projects in the state will become easier," the cabinet said.
 
 For the record, the Gujarat land acquisition act, 2016, dilutes the stringent provision of the 2013 act and will do away with social impact assessment (SIA) for projects related to defence and social sectors such as building air base, defence manufacturing units, schools, roads, canals and affordable houses. It also says that the SIA will not be carried out for land acquisition for industrial corridor and   projects taken up by the government. Further, it also does away with the provision that 80 per cent of the affected parties should give their consent. The bill approved by the Gujarat government also got the President's nod in August, 2016. 
 
 With the land acquisition becoming a problem for several projects in the state, the   government decided to make amendments for easier acquisition. 
 
 Several activists had voiced their concerns regarding the amendments. 
 
 Former IAS officer and activist   too had written a letter to President   last month requesting him not to give his ascent to the bill.
