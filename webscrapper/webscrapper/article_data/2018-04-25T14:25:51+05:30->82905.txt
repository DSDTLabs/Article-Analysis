PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor   on Monday expressed serious concern over   jumping bail and indulging in   killings in the Union territory.

 Bedi visited the   prison on Monday and directed the inspector general of prisons to evolve a detailed, step-by-step standard operating procedure to reform hardcore criminals lodged in the prison, in an effort to prevent them from indulging in   to exact revenge on their rival gang members after coming out on bail.
 
 She sought the IGP (prisons) to rope in the services of the experts in psychology, criminology and sociology in extending proper counselling to the hardcore criminals in an effort to reform them. She also suggested involving volunteers from the Art of Living and Isha Foundations for the process.
 
 Later in the day, she held a meeting with the director general of police S K Gautam, senior superintendent of police (law and order) Apoorva Gupta, secretary (law) G Sendil Kumar and director (prosecution) V Ruthra Kumar and directed them to launch coordinated efforts in checking revenge-related crimes committed by the criminals released from the prison. She insisted on keeping a close tab on whether these prisoners abide by the sureties given to the judiciary.
 
 She was of the strong opinion that the coordinated efforts of these agencies (police, prison, law department and judiciary) will narrow down the communication gap and prevent the criminals from indulging in crimes. “Each agency will detail the operating procedures to ensure crime  , thereby enhancing safety. They will also plan in detail community policing measures, to ensure people’s responsibility in crime control,” she said.
