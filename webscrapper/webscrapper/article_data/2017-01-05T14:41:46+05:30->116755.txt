CHENNAI: A day after being appointed as the   of the  ,   on Thursday claimed that only his party can create a better  . 

 In a letter to party members, Stalin said there was no development in the state in the last five years and only the DMK can change the situation. 
 
 Stalin recalled late chief minister C N Annadurai’s famous words “Ei, Thaazhndha Thamizhagame” (Tamil Nadu which was below other states in development) and said: “There is no opportunity for the youth in the state now, and women have been facing all sorts of sufferings in the last five years. Only DMK can create a better Tamil Nadu in the coming years.”
 
 He said, “Instead of looking me as the son of Thalaivar (DMK chief M  ), you should consider me one among you. I welcome all of you to work for the party as this Dravidian crop (means DMK) will last 1,000 years."
 
 He said, "We should not fight with one another. We should take on anybody who is against Tamil Nadu. We will work towards having a new Tamil Nadu." 
 
 Stalin’s letter has some similarities with the letters Karunanidhi used to write. While Karunanidhi addressed party members as “Udan Pirappe" (brethren), Stalin starts the letter by saying “Our Thalaivar’s beloved brethren” and goes on to say, “I write as one among you.”
 
 A DMK leader said Stalin might write to party members every day as Karunanidhi used to do before he fell ill.
