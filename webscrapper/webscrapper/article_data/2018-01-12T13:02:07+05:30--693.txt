CHANDIGARH: All set to frame new   for the admissions of the non-resident Indians ( ) for 2018-19, Panjab   (PU) is mulling over making SAT,   and GMAT score mandatory for them to take admission in different courses here. After the committee takes the final decision, the senate would take up the matter for final approval. 

 Dean university instructions (DUI), PU,   said as per the new guidelines, the NRI students will have to appear for SAT, GRE, GMAT and other such tests to qualify for taking admission in PU under the NRI category. However, she said the final decision was yet to be taken by the committee. Once the decision is taken by the committee, it would be sent for the approval by the senate, she added.
 
 The senate, in its last meeting on December 16, 2017, post-facto approved the guidelines for NRI students seeking admission to PG/UG courses for 2017-18 as was applicable in the year 2016-17. In the same meeting, it was decided that the fresh guidelines should be made for the next academic year 2018-19.
 
 According to the records of the dean international students’ office, only 17 NRI students took admission in the university in the 2017-18 session as compared to 41 in 2016-17 academic year. PU had changed the guidelines for (NRI) quota admissions frequently last year. It was stated that the children of Indian-origin people, (who may or may not be citizens of the countries other than India) or of overseas citizens of India, will get admission under the NRI quota, provided they have resided in a country other than India for a minimum period of three years immediately preceding the year of admission in PU.
 
 However, later, after being approved by the syndicate, the norms were again changed to the previous ones. The previous norms that have been implemented again for the 2017-18 session do not make this three-year clause mandatory. After the guidelines were ratified by the syndicate, it was decided in a meeting in July 2017 that those norms will not be implemented since PU would lose a major chunk of income if the admissions happen following the new guidelines. There is not only a decline in the number of international students’ enrolment in campus but also in its recruitment of international faculty till date.
 
 As per the ranking of the varsity in the past three years, in 2016 the university got 14.1 points for international outlook parameter, in 2015, it got 29.2 points and in 2016, the university scored 29.3 marks.
