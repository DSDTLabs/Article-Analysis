CHARMINAR:   (MIM) president   on Friday said that his party is filling an alternative space that has been created in politics.

 Owaisi was speaking to a group of media persons in Lucknow as he announced that the party has decided to contest for 36 seats.
 
 “Till recently, there was no alternative in Uttar Pradesh. Today, there is an alternative space in politics which the MIM is trying to occupy,“ the parliamentarian from Hyderabad, who is on a UP tour, said. “Being an alternate means to give people a choice,“ he said.
 
 Owaisi, however, did not comment whether he would ally with any party.
 
 The MIM supremo said that there are several issues on which he is fighting the elections. These, he said, include corruption, poor governance and communal riots which he pegged at 1,000. He criticized the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for what he described as an `inconsistent foreign policy' even as he reiterated the issue of Pathankot attacks, infiltration from Pakistan occupied Kashmir and demonetization. He also sought to know why the   (BJP) is silent of the arrest and alleged links of a BJP worker to the   of Pakistan.Launching a salvo against Uttar Pradesh chief minister  , Owaisi said that those who voted for him were `looted' by the SP government. “All promises in the past five years, like reservations were forgotten.They said that those in jail would be released, this was not done. The promised schools were not opened,“ Owaisi added. On the same day Owaisi inducted senior   (SP) leader Asim Waqar into MIM.
 
 The MIM appears to be cautious while issuing statements about its performance in Uttar Pradesh.While Owaisi said that the response has been `encouraging', he also shares that one has to be realistic. “I believe that if you do something the right way, that effort can be taken forward.“
