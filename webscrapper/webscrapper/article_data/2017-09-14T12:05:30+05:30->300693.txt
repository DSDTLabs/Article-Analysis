JODHPUR: Final arguments in the case of poaching of two blackbucks allegedly by   began here on Wednesday after a long pause. The prosecution counsel began with the final arguments in the trial court which will continue tomorrow.

 While beginning the final arguments, prosecution counsel Bhawani Singh summed up the prosecution’s case describing the spot of alleged poaching and the post-mortem report.
 
 “We also cited the statements of the eyewitnesses Poonam Chand and  , who had seen Khan along with other persons poaching the blackbucks in Kankani on October 1-2, 1998 in a vehicle,” said Bhati.
 
 This is the only case among four, including two poaching cases of chinkara at Bhawad and Mathania ( ) and a case for alleged use of arms with expired licence, which is in the trial court.
 
 The accused’s statements in this case had been taken by the court in March but the final arguments were held up on account of the prosecution moving an application seeking documents pertaining to the post mortem by the veterinarian N P Nepalia.
 
 Even the decision on this application had been handed out by the trial court in July but on account of various reasons, the final arguments could not begin.
 
 Khan’s counsel H M Saraswat said the application, which we had objected to, was an attempt by the prosecution to delay the trail of this case.
 
 “The trial court rejected this application and now the final arguments have begun. After the prosecution would be over, we would begin with our arguments,” said Saraswat adding that this case would soon reach the stage of judgment.
 
 Once the prosecution wraps up its arguments, Sarswat will begin with the arguments which will be followed by the counsels of co-accused comprising Neelam,  , Tabu and  , who have been charged with abetting the crime.
