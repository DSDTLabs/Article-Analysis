NEW DELHI: Cryptocurrency exchange Coinsecure has announced a reward of Rs 2 crore (approx) to anyone who can help in recovering the stolen  . The digital currency exchange said that it had lost $3 million (nearly Rs 20 crore) from its bitcoin wallet, the biggest reported so far in the country's fledgling virtual currency market.

 
 Coinsecure, which has over 2,00,000 users trading on its platform daily, said that around 438 bitcoins, which were stored in a password-protected virtual wallet were siphoned off to an unknown destination on the internet.
 
 The exchange in a statement released on its website said: "We are also seeking help from the Bitcoin community and all our users who can help us identify the hacker or give us any information that could lead us to recover funds."
 
 It added that, "We are happy to issue a bounty of 10 per cent to the community for help rendered for recovery of BTC." 
 
 Addressing the users' concern about the safety of the online currency portal, it also said that "your INR (Indian rupee) funds are safe with Coinsecure." "We will be updating our users over the next week on how the withdrawals can be requested and processed," it added.
 
 Coinsecure had earlier said that it would compensate customers for losses from its existing funds.
 
 Sharing their view on the matter, legal experts called for a need to regulate the virtual currency market, instead of imposing restrictions on its trade.
 
 "It is for reasons like these that there is a need to regulate crypto-exchanges," said Anirudh Rastogi, founder and managing partner at TRA Law, a firm that specialises in emerging-technology businesses.
 
 "Pushing the exchange business out from the formal economy to the informal cash economy to operate under the radar will worsen the problem, not solve it," Rastogi added.
