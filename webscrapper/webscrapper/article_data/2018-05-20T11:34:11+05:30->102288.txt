CHANDIGARH: A police official was sent to police lines on corruption charges and a departmental inquiry initiated against him on May 17, days after a sub-inspector and a constable were arrested in a graft case.

 Sub-inspector Anil Kumar is accused of trying to extort around Rs 3.5 lakh from a youth involved in an accident two months back. He was building pressure on Manimajra resident to arrange the cash to settle the accident that took place on February 7. Five persons were injured after the complainantâ€™s bike had rammed an auto-rickshaw. The complainant had fled from the spot. Later, his brother had gone to meet the auto driver in PGI and requested for a compromise. However, the Manimajra police had registered an FIR on the statement of the auto driver under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) against the biker. Anil Kumar was the investigating officer in the case.
 
 The sub-inspector contacted the biker and allegedly demanded Rs 3.5 lakh. According to the complainant, the cop was constantly demanding money from him. Later, he recorded his conversation with him on his mobile phone and gave it to senior officials in the police headquarters. After verifying the audio clip, Anil Kumar was sent to police lines and departmental inquiry marked against him.
 
 Satish Kumar,   (east division), has confirmed that the sub-inspector was sent to police lines but did not disclose the reason behind the transfer. He was transferred on administrative grounds, the DSP said.
