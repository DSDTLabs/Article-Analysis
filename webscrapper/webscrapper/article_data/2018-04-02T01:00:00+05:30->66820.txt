Actress   is a diehard football fan. She not only follows the game passionately, but plays it too. In fact, the model-actress spends a lot of time on the ground — sometimes to nurture underprivileged kids’ interest in the sport and at other times playing for women’s football leagues.

 However, her love for soccer took a painful turn while playing for one of the leagues in Bandra recently. During a friendly match,   ended up fracturing her right leg. Though she’s on crutches and out of action, the Iranian beauty says she is not complaining. 
 
 “Well, I haven’t had proper rest for almost eight months now — I moved into a new house, got back to work, was busy training kids and also juggling with my gym and football practice. So, I’m using this forced break to catch up with sleep. I haven’t watched any of the recently released films, so I am catching up on that, too! I am also utilising this break to get in touch with my friends as I haven’t been able to talk to them as we used to,” she says.
