ROHTAK: Union minister of state for power   on Thursday said from July 1 onwards, electricity connections would be issued within one week. All documents related to power connection would have to be submitted at the common service centres ( ) set up in the villages.

 Speaking at a meeting held in Rohtak to review the functioning of power utilities, Goyal said both the central and state governments were working in tandem in the field of energy saving. “The cost of LED bulb has been reduced by 88%, and is now provided to people at Rs 65 only. The Union power ministry will provide 30 lakh LED bulbs to   every month,” he said.
 
 Stating that there was no shortage of power, Goyal directed the officers of power utilities to encourage people to pay their electricity bills so that 24-hour power could be supplied to them.
 
 He said some good schemes were being implemented in the power sector in Haryana. “Under the ‘Mhara Gaon Jagmag Gaon’ scheme, 24-hour power is being supplied to villages where electricity meters have been installed outside houses and people are regularly paying their bills,” said Goyal.
 
 He directed the officers to work honestly and said the government would incentivise them. “For the first time in the history of the country, electricity rates have been slashed by up to Rs 1.5 per unit. Power consumers should avail themselves of schemes of the government to get 24-hour power supply,” he added.
 
 Goyal urged the youth and students to connect with the honest system and encourage people to pay electricity bills and save energy. “Corruption will not be tolerated and if anyone is found guilty at any level strict action will be initiated against them. Electricity related complaints can be got registered at toll free number 1912,” he said.
 
 He said the Urja Mitra App had been launched where data of every consumer had been uploaded. Through this application, consumers would be provided information about power supply in their areas through SMS.
