NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has discharged   Manoj Kumar, Raju Dhingan, Bandana Kumari and other members, accused of wrongful restraint and defamation, on a complaint lodged by expelled party leader Vinod Kumar Binny.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate   observed that it was “improper” to take cognisance of a chargesheet filed for defamation (Section 500) of IPC without examining the complainant first.
 
 The complainant alleged that on September 21, 2014, AAP leaders, along with other “paid workers”, protested outside his house; hurled “abusive” and “defamatory” slogans; and “wrongfully restrained” him for a few hours.
 
 The police had registered an FIR for wrongful restraint (Section 341 of IPC) and defamation (500) against the leaders.
 
 The court said, “In the present  , cognisance of the offence of defamation was taken on the basis of the chargesheet…this was improper and not in accordance with statutory provisions — Section 199 CrPC. There is no complaint of the complainant on which the court could have taken cognisance of commission of offence of defamation. The only complaint is one written to the SHO, but this cannot be considered as a complaint made to the court valid under Section 199 of CrPC,” it said.
