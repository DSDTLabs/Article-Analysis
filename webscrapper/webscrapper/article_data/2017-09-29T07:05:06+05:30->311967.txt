AHMEDABAD: Ex-IPS officer   filed a   questioning the present practice of state government to appoint   instead of having a regular full-time police chief.

 Sharma alleged in the PIL that appointment of a mere incharge DGP conveys a wrong message. “It conveys the message that the government of the day wants to keep the police force as a pawn in its hands,“ the PIL stated.
 
 Hearing the PIL on Thursday , the HC sought a reply from the state government as to why the state has not appointed a regular DGP . Gujarat does not have a regular DG since since April 15, 2016, when P P Pandey was given the charge of the post. In the PIL, Sharma has sought directions from the court to the state government to appoint a regular, full-time DGP , and to begin exercise for selection of new DGP at least one month prior to the date of retirement of incumbent DGP in future.
 
 Sharma has also complained that though there are six officers of rank of DGP , the government does not appoint a regular DGP . Geetha Johri too is just an in-charge of the post.He contended that the present practice of keeping in-charge DGP is contrary to provisions of the Bombay Police Act and the Supreme Court directions.
