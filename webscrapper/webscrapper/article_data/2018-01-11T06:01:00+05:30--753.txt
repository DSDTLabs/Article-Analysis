Nagpur: Expressing anguish over top bureaucrats’ failure to respond to its notices, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Tuesday   to the secretary of rural development and water conservation department Asim Gupta and additional chief secretary of the general administration department Mukesh Khullar.

 A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi asked the duo to appear personally on March 5. On October 10, the bench had issued notices seeking their reply by December 31, but the officials failed to comply with the HC orders, according to petitioner’s counsel Amol Chakotkar.
 
 The directives came while hearing a contempt plea by Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Samiti (MRPSS) through its president Dhyaneshwar Nakade for fixation of higher pay-scale for its members as per the government resolution (GR) of August 6, 2002. It mentioned that those working in the tribal or Naxalite-infested areas are entitled to one promotion or next higher payscale as long as they worked there.
 
 Earlier, the petitioner had filed a plea with similar grievances after which the HC, on July 4 last year, directed the respondents to exercise fixation of next higher payscale to the MRPSS members within two months from the date of order. The judges had also asked the government to release arrears in the next three months.
 
 Later, the petitioner approached the respondents in the same month and submitted the copy of the court’s order requesting them to comply with it at the earliest.
 
 On September 16 last year, the petitioner again submitted a representation in reference to the court’s orders, but the respondents failed to act forcing him to knock the judiciary’s doors again.
 
 Citing the Constitution of India and Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, the petitioner contended that the respondents don’t respect the judiciary and wilfully disobeyed the court’s orders of July 4.
