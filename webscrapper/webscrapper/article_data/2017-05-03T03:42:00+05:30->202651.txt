Calangute: The Calangute village panchayat has decided not to hold the ‘Summer beat show’ this year at the Calangute beach in view of the forthcoming panchayat elections.

 Two years ago the panchayat had revived the famous ‘Shimla beat show’, which used to be held on the beach during the 1960’s and 1970’s. Thousands of Goans – besides tourists - from all over would descend on Calangute beach for the festival. The biggest bands from all over the country would perform at this festival. The last ‘Shimla beat show’ was held in 1976. The beat show, first held in 1965, had put Calangute on the world tourism map.
 
 Two years ago, in an attempt to recreate the magic of that era, the Calangute panchayat had decided to have a new ‘Summer beat show’ on the beach featuring leading Goan artistes like Lorna. The show had been held in the last week of May for the last two years.
