PUNE:   Chandrakant Dalvi has re-scheduled the timings for village-level workers or   in the Pune division to ensure speedy redressal of villagers’ grievances.

 With rising complaints of villagers unable to meet these gram sevaks, Dalvi not only re-scheduled their timing from 10.30am earlier to 9am now, but also set timings for their visit to the   on alternate Monday’s for holding meetings in the villages.
 
 All 3,767 gram sevaks working in 6,500 villages in the division will have to follow the new timing.
 
 “There are several issues of the villagers which were not reaching the gram sevaks as by the time they reached the village, the villagers were already out working in the fields. Besides agricultural issues, there are plenty of civic issues and government scheme-related problems that these villagers need help in,” Dalvi said on Wednesday.
 
 Another issue of concern was that some of the gram sevaks were given more than two villages. To resolve this issue, the divisional commissioner has assured that unnecessary burden will not be put on gram sevaks. “If the gram sevaks are unnecessarily given more villages, action will be taken against the concerned block-level officer,” he said.
 
 Dalvi has also directed the gram sevaks to create awareness about several schemes, such as MNREGA, that have not been implemented in the villages as the residents are unaware about them. He added that there are enough gram sevaks in all the districts under the Pune division.
