BENGALURU: The   will look into the possibility of compiling a list of brand names of drugs and medicines available in the country which contain substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

 NADA director general   told TOI that his organisation will consider this step to prevent inadvertent drug abuse. "The generic names of prohibited substances are already on our website. But we can evolve a system to keep athletes informed about the over-the-counter drugs available in the market, the ones that contain prohibited substances and the ones that don't,"   said. "But it will not be an exhaustive list. We obviously cannot include every medicine available in the market. Many drugs are imported and it is difficult for us to keep track of them," he added.
 
 It would be the second time NADA would be embarking on the task in six years. In 2011, the anti doping agency had compiled a list with the help of the director general of health services, a member of its governing body. NADA's initiative comes as a follow-up to the   doping incident. The footballer, who was let off with a reprimand on Wednesday by the agency's disciplinary panel for testing positive for terbutaline (beta-2 agonist), had been prescribed a cough syrup Ascoril by his team doctor.
