CHARMINAR:  ,   to live in, especially for its youth.  , 18, was struck by a bullet during a skirmish between extremists and security forces. The young Afghan awaits treatment at the   (OGH). But with little money in an alien land, it appears that the boy is waiting for a miracle.

 It was around two years ago that a bullet had pierced Qahar's pelvis from the right. It tore into his colon and ripped through his bladder before shattering his hip bone. The exit wound is visible on the left side of his pelvis. The scars are a grim reminder of the horrors of war. Documents from the Kabul's Emergency Hospital -Surgical and Medical Centre for Civilian War Victims -show that he was operated upon twice: once in December 2014 and later in January 2015. But Qahar is still immobile.
 
 Speaking in an accented Urdu, Razaq says, “We arrived in India on January 3. Our friends in my country told us treatment at the OGH is free and that Hyderabadis are helpful. We got a letter from member of National Assembly , Nader Khan Katawazai, who wrote to the Indian embassy for a visa for treatment.“ The city has been kind to them, Razaq says. But more funds are needed. Back home, peo ple have send small donations for Qahar's treatment. “My Pashtun brothers have given us money . But we are unsure what will be our fate here.The doctors are kind and have run tests,“ he said.
 
 The doctors of OGH said that the boy is young. He was shot when he was only 16 years old. He needs more treatment to be able to walk. For their part, the doctors are exploring all options to arrange funds for his treatment. Speaking to TOI superintendent G V Murthy said, “The patient needs a hip replacement. We are doing whatever we can.“
