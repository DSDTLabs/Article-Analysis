KOLKATA: Model-turned-anchor Sonika Singh Chauhan’s friend – designer Abhishek Dutta – is happy that actor   was arrested late last night. The actor was arrested in front of a mall in connection with the car crash that had killed Chauhan in April. Chatterjee has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting for murder for her death. The charge carries a maximum jail-term of 10 years.

 Said Dutta, who is part of the Justice for Sonika group on Facebook, “I was quite surprised since I have been hearing of him going missing. I thought it would take a while for him to get arrested. So, the morning news comes as a pleasant surprise. In fact two days back, I had a discussion with Saheb Bhattacharya on this issue. He was quite depressed about the whole thing. All of Sonika’s friends and supporters must be thrilled with this news as much as I am.”
 
 According to the designer, this arrest should have been done much earlier. “However, this gives us a little more faith in our law and order system. Now, everything depends on his bail plea hearing. Everyone’s prayers have been answered. His arrest before Sonika’s birthday on July 12 is a true gift for her parents. They have been broken down fighting with the system. I hope justice is served finally. I also have a suggestion for Vikram. He should stick to the truth and not misguide the law. At least that will get some relaxation and sympathy for him,” Dutta signed off.
