LUCKNOW: A day after  's order to   and   operating without licences, the city felt an   on Wednesday. While 80% of the meat shops were closed, sending customers back empty-handed,   said they only had two days' stock left. Consequently, functions and ceremonies to be held also suffered. 

 Those who had meat as a staple in their diet didn't know what to do about the shut sops. Hotels and restaurants in old Lucknow also ran out of stock by evening. Prominent food junctions downed their shutters due to shortage of fresh stock. For many Shia families celebrating the birth anniversary of Imam Hasan at 'Dastarkhwan', a popular restaurant, celebration turned bland for want of meat items. 
 
 As if shortage of meat wasn't a problem big enough, many people have been rendered jobless. Seven members in the family of Ainul Qureshi, a Nakkas resident who ran a biryani joint, are jobless. Though Ainul always procured a kg meat separately for his family, he doesn't know what to do now. "Bufallo meat is cheap and my father and sons avoid food without meat," said Ainul.
 
 Shafeen Ahmad, a resident of Mansoornagar, said, "My brother's wedding is on Thursday. I had ordered for meat in advance. But due to the closure, I just don't know what to do and where to go for help because this is happening across the state." 
 
 When Anurag Mishra, a resident of Jankipuram Vistaar, came out on Wednesday morning to buy chicken for his family, he saw all the shops closed while a few shops on IIM road were being forced shut. "I saw action against meat shops. I had to return empty-handed," he said. 
 
 For Somil Chatterjee, it won't be easy surviving without meat. This Aliganj resident ate either mutton or chicken every day. "I belong to Bengal and work here. We cook mutton, chicken and sometimes, even beef, but this sudden closure of meat shops has disturbed both my food and my mood. Vegetables are essential but it doesn't mean we can't have meat as well," Somil said.
