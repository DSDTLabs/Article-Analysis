  Abhishek Singh on Wednesday inspected the site for the proposed stadium-cum-athletic complex. The project is estimated to cost about Rs 5 crore.
 
 The DM said the proposed stadium is to be built in a 13.6-acre area near Bhusunda village. “As per the specifications, the new stadium will be 217 metre long and 176 metre wide. The stadium, being built in the conventional mode (it will not have synthetic turf), will have facilities for football, high jump, long jump, javelin throw and shot put, among others. There will also be a track for runners,” the DM said and added a 230-metre- long parking area would also be developed.
 
 Singh said instructions have been issued to building construction department officials to begin the bidding process for this project within a week.
 
 According to   sources, a decision on the fate of Harihar Subramanium Stadium will be taken later. Some parts of the old stadium have collapsed. Sources said the stadium was likely to be demolished to promote greenery in the town.
