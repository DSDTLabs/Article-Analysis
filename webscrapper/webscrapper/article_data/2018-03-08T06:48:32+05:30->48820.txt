LUCKNOW :   bus station might see a reduction in congestion soon. 

 Wednesday onwards, state buses plying from the spot will follow a new system. The buses will be allowed inside the station premises only 15 minutes before departure. 
 
 Though the system has been introduced to cut down congestion inside and outside the station, on Wednesday, there was a huge jam in Charbagh.
 
 Buses were parked along the main road since they were not allowed inside the station. Passengers also had to face a tough time due to the congestion. 
 
 "We tried to regulate things ourselves and control the jam till late in the evening. It might take a day or two for things to fall in place," said ARM Charbagh RK Tripathi.
 
 The entire fleet of buses is being operated from Charbagh and   bus stations as   bus depot is closed for operations.
 
 All AC buses operate from Charbagh station.
