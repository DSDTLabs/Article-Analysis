Mapusa: Ten days have passed since the theft of the automated teller machine (ATM) at Agarwada, Pernem, but the police are yet gather any substantial clues in the case.  "We have retrieved the CCTV footage from the ATM booth, and are analysing it for all possibilities. In the footage, two persons are seen entering the ATM booth. However, they cannot be identified as the footage is poor in quality," Mapusa DySP Mahesh Gaonkar told TOI. Gaonkar said that there are no other specific leads in the case. So far, police have not arrested or detained any suspect in the case for investigation. Sources said that the CCTV camera was installed on the wall above the machine, and it was not damaged or covered by the accused. On September 9, unidentified culprits decamped with the ATM of State Bank of India installed at Agarwada. The machine was later recovered in a forested area a few kilometres away. Cash amounting to Rs 18.81 lakh was stolen from the ATM.
