SHIMLA:   High Court, on Tuesday, directed all superintendents of police in districts to set up a portal and a dedicated toll free line to implement provisions under the   Act, under which anyone can inform authorities concerned about the whereabouts of any person believed to be suffering from a mental illness or is incapable of taking care of himself. The court directed SPs and Director General of Police (DGP) to file affidavits of compliance on or before January 5.

 A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice   and justice Ajay Mohan Goel passed the orders on a petition by   Bansal who sought directions to be issued to the authorities to comply with mandatory provisions under the Mental Health Care Act, so that mentally ill persons in the state who are ill-treated and neglected by guardians or relatives are taken care of.
