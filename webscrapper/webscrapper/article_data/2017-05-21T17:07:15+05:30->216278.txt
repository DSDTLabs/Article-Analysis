Actor   says he is a big fan of his ' ' co-star Tabu but he wants to see her do light-hearted and fun films. In the fourth installment of the comedy film, Ajay Devgn, Arshad, Shreyas Talpade,   and Kunal Khemu will be reprising their roles from 'Golmaal 3', while Tabu and Parineeti Chopra are the new entrants to the franchise.

  
  
 The 'Jolly LLB' actor says though it's a delight to have Parineeti and Tabu in the film, they don't have much to do in terms of comedy. 
 
 "They don't have too much of comedy in the film. Tabu is serious (as an actor) and she will also do a good job (in comedy) but there is a maturity with her performance. I want to really see Tabu do some mad, fun comedy, she is too much of a serious actor," Arshad said. 
 
 "I know Tabu for quite some time and it is now that we are working together. I am a big fan of Tabu and I like the films she has done so far," he said. Talking about Parineeti, Arshad says, "Parineeti will also do a good job at comedy. I liked Parineeti in 'Ladies vs Ricky Bahl', she was outstanding in it. I like her, she is adorable, she is full of life and good at acting." 
 
 Arshad says he is having great fun working with the team of 'Golmaal 4'. "We, including me, Ajay, Shreyas, Kunal are used to the world of 'Golmaal'. They (Tabu and Parineeti) have a problem in controlling their laughter when we do the scenes," he said. 
 
 Helmed by Rohit Shetty, 'Golmaal 4' was earlier set to clash at the box office with Rajinikanth-starrer '2.0'. But now the two movies are slated to release on difference dates. 
 
 "It's good as it eats up each other's business. Both are good and much awaited films. We are happy '2.0' has been pushed ahead," Arshad said.
