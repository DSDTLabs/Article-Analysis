MANGALURU: Former KPCC president   on Monday slammed   and home minister   for dithering to order the arrest of BJP Kagwad MLA Bharamagouda Alagouda Kage aka Raju Kage for his alleged involvement in a near murderous assault on   and his mother Ujwala. It is the duty of both the CM and home minister to direct the police to arrest the MLA and not get swayed by his reputation.

 Addressing reporters on Monday, Poojary said with TV news channels repeatedly flashing the brazen manner in which relatives of Kage barged into Vivek’s house, assaulted him and his mother is reflective of the mindset of the MLA and his ilk. 
 
 “Kage’s defence that he knew Vivek but was not involved in the incident or knew nothing about the alleged derogatory Facebook post against his daughter by the assault victim is a poor defence at saving himself,” he noted.
 
 Poojary said the CM should send out a clear message that rule of law prevails in the state. “The CM does not have the guts to carry out administration in a manner in which it is required of him,” Poojary said.
