KOCHI:   AV George has - in an unprecedented move - submitted a 30-page report on the massive encroachment and quarrying activities in the district to the district collector. George has since been shunted out of Idukki and posted as SP,  . 

 The report, dated January 5, cites massive quarrying, illegal constructions and water pollution in many areas in a 250-sq km stretch in Idukki. Photographs have also been included in it.
 
 "The wetlands and water bodies are being reclaimed and verdant hills are being flattened in many areas. Instead, many high-rise buildings have come up in eco-sensitive areas. In Pallivasal village, for instance, a multi-storied building stands in a precarious state," it says.
 
 The report says eucalyptus and casuarina plantations have drastically reduced the water level in Kanthaloor and Vattavada areas. It recommends that huge building complexes should not be allowed in this region besides limiting the buildings' height to three storeys.
 
 "There should also be a general ban on quarrying in this region," it adds.
