LUCKNOW: A 53-year-old bed-ridden man has given a second life to his ailing son. 

 Rahul Gupta, 25, was diagnosed with   failure last year. Owing to renal complications, Rahul, a native of Barabanki also had a memory loss for some time. On Wednesday, Rahul underwent a successful   at Dr   (RMLIMS). The kidney was donated by his father Sudhir Kumar.
 
 The six-hour surgery was done by a nine-member team of doctors. This was the second kidney transplant at RMLIMS.
 
 Rahul, the sole bread winner of his family of five, was diagnosed with jaundice last year. His mother Rekha Gupta said they took Rahul to many hospitals but his condition only got worse. “Six months ago we started Rahul’s dialysis since his condition was critical,” said RMLIMS director Prof Deepak Malviya. 
 
 Rahul’s father has been bed-ridden for the past three years after suffering a fracture in the hip bone.
 
 The doctors who performed the transplant were Dr Abhilash Chandra, Dr Alok Srivastava, Dr Ishwar Dayal, Dr Sanjeet, Dr Vijay, Dr Shobhit, Dr Anurag, Dr Somya Shankarnath, and Dr Aneesh Srivastava.
