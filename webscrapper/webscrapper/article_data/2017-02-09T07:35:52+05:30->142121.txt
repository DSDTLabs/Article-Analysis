MANGALURU: Di sappointment awaits those who want to click a selfie or a photograph with scientist and Bharat Ratna recipient   this Saturday. 

  Yenepoya University authorities have barred people from clicking pictures of Rao during his visit to the university on February 11 to receive   and deliver a lecture. 
 
 University registrar Dr Shreekumar Menon said: "This is one of the conditions put forth by the 85-year-old scientist saying he cannot withstand flash or any kind of photography which could disturb him. We have taken his request seriously and even mentioned it in the invitation."
 
 West Indies cricketer  , who was in the city last Sunday, also bore the brunt of a selfie-crazy crowd which went into a frenzy for photographs with him.
