LUDHIANA: Several businessmen lashed out at the   (PSERC) and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( ) for the proposed increase of 16% in power tariffs from 2018-19. However,   chairperson Kusumjit Sidhu — during the public hearing conducted by the regulatory commission — said interests of all stakeholders would be kept in consideration before reaching any conclusion. 

 According to Badish Jindal, president of   ( ): “We have lodged a strong protest against the proposal to hike power tariffs by close to 16% in 2018-19, which is totally unjustified, particularly at a time when the state’s industry is struggling. In fact, PSERC should keep a tab on PSPCL’s financial health, which is deteriorating day by day.”
 
 He added: “PSPCL’s thermal production has come down from 18,326 million units in 2009-10 to 4,727 million units in 2018-19, and it is moving on the path of complete bankruptcy. We, as consumers, are already paying 72.24 paisa per unit for interest paid by PSPCL to banks and other financial institutions. But while PSPCL revenues are falling, expenses were on a sharp rise. In 2014-15, PSPCL recruited 276 employees, in 2015-16 the number was 178, while in 2016-17 — due to elections — the government recruited 8,632 employees, which have increased PSPCL’s employee cost from Rs 4,076 crore to Rs 5,744 crore. Instead of cutting costs, PSPCL wants to put the burden of its losses on us, which is not tolerable at any cost.”
