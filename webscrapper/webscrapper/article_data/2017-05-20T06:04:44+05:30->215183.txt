 Eleven persons were killed in the Naroda Gam massacre that took place during the 2002 riots in  . As many as 84 persons are being tried for the killings. 
 
 Apart from Bajrangi and Patel, former minister Maya Kodnani is also an accused in this case. 
 
 Bajrangi and Kodnani were convicted to life imprisonment in another 2002 riots case, the Naroda Patia massacre, in which 97 persons were killed. 
 
 Kishan Kirstal, who lives in Naroda, appeared as a defence witness and told the court that he passed through the market of Naroda Gam twice on the morning of February 28, 2002, but did not perceive tension there. At around 1.30pm, he saw a mob rioting near Mayur Hotel. He said he did not see Bajrangi, Patel or Vallabh Patel in the mob. Vallabh was a BJP municipal councillor from the area then.
 
 Since Kirstal was summoned as a secret witness, the prosecution sought time to cross-examine him.Before Kirstal, three defence witnesses - Vashram Patel, Dhanji Patel and Dr Manilal Patel - had deposed that on the day of rioting, Bajrangi was in Derol Kampa village near Khedbrahma, some 140km from Naroda.
