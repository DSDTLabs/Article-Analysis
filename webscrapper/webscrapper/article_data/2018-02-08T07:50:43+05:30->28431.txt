BHOPAL: The   through used needles is a clear and present danger in  , as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages have   and zero awareness on the virus.

 Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds. 
 
 What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts — sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks.
 
 “We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,” said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. “Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,” he added.
 
 However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population — less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP.
 
 Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more.
