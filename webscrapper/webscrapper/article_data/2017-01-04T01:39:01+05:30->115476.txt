 I made a fool of myself transferring over Rs 1 lakh to a man I met on a matrimonial site. Yes, that is no story, it's old hat. So let's not dwell on it too much. 
 
 What I want to share is all the details that will help ordinary citizens with a ken for investigation take on the mantle of the police. A complaint was made with cyber police on December 26.
 
 I received calls for the money after a woman with a Mumbai phone number told me that a certain sum had to paid as fine, as the fellow on the matrimonial site, who pretended to be from the UK, had arrived in India with more pounds than permissible under law. I fell for that lie - and transferred first Rs 25,700 and then Rs 78,000. (Yes, I was utterly, utterly foolish and wonder now how I did it!)
 
 I tried to get the Sahar police station to take a complaint but cops maintained that since there was no proof of anything criminal happening in their jurisdiction, they could not help. That was when I made the complaint with cyber police. All has been quiet since. 
 
 If the fellows behind this fraud are not quickly caught, they'll be making merry defrauding other women.
 
 So here are all the details needed for investigation:
 
 The man I was talking to pretended to be Richard Clement Williams. His phone number (he made only WhatsApp calls): +44 7481 347030; the woman who pretended to belong to the immigration desk of Mumbai airport said her name was Sumitra Kumar. Her phone number: 7738430217.
 
 I made transfers into the accounts of: Jitender Singh, Canara Bank, A/C number: 3160101006028; IFSC code: CNRB0003160; MICR code: 110015188. (Rs25,700 on December 20). I later went on the Canara Bank website to lodge a complaint, but was told by customer care that this was the job of police.
 
 On December 21, I transferred Rs 78,000 to M Chinanso, A/C number 30020110022221; IFSC code: UCBA0003002, UCO Bank (Imphal). (My Scottish sweetheart, by the way, sounded north eastern!)
 
 I was also given other account numbers: Vinod Kumar, A/C number: 90462010123157; IFSC code: SYNB0009046 (Syndicate Bank) Pan No: EBDPK2019H, and Manoj Sharma, Andhra Bank A/c number: 026810100089271; IFSC code: ANDB0000268
 
 No money, thankfully, was transferred into the last two accounts.
 
 Now, is it going to be elementary, Mr Watson?
