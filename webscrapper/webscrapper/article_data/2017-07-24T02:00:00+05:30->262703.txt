PATNA: Prelingual deaf children from below poverty line families will soon be able to receive cochlear implants at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences ( ) with the help of the state government. A prelingual deaf individual is someone who was born with a hearing loss or whose hearing loss occurred before they began to speak.

 The state government has agreed to provide Rs6.5 lakh for cochlear implants for children from BPL families or whose parent’s annual income is less than Rs2 lakh.
 
 “Our ear, nose and throat (ENT) department is ready with all the facilities for the implants. We have already selected three patients for the implants. Around 25 other patients are on the waiting list. The operations will begin from last week of August or first week of September,” said HoD of IGIMS ENT department, Dr Rakesh Kumar Singh.
 
 He said all the pre and post-operation procedures would be carried out at IGIMS. “The patient will not have to go anywhere else. We will carry out aural rehabilitation, audiology assessment, audio-verbal rehabilitation, check for any anomalies and brain status as per the guidelines followed post-operation,” he said.
 
 Dr Kumar said the cochlear device alone costs Rs4.65 lakh. Rest of the money will cover other expenses of the operation, rehabilitation therapies and medicines.
 
 IGIMS is carrying out the procedures in collaboration with AIIMS Delhi. “Prof Rakesh Kumar from the otorhinolaryngology department of AIIMS Delhi has been appointed as a visiting professor at IGIMS and would provide assistance when required,” said Dr Kumar.
