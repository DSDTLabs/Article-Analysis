CHANDIGARH: The attendance of students in government schools, on Wednesday, improved by 10% to 30% in every school but is yet to go beyond 60% in most out of the total 115 schools.

On Monday, which was the first day of school after winter vacations, the attendance in was as low as 5% to 8% in some of the schools and did not exceed 40% in any school. 

 "The attendance in our school has reached around 60%.

The absentees mainly include the primary wing students and students who come from a little far off places. The teachers are expecting the attendance to improve next week after Lohri festival falling on the weekend. On the other hand, many private schools in Chandigarh have changed their school timings and parents of government schools, too, are waiting for the same. "The department officials should come out and see how cold it is in the morning. My daughter told me that classrooms remain very cold. The department should change the timing of the schools like those in Punjab. What is the harm?" said  ,
