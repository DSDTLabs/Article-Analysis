CHENNAI: Water crisis has severely hit Cape Town and the situation is going from bad to worse every day. Help is pouring in from across the globe and India skipper  , known for his charity work, too extended his support along with his South African counterpart  . The duo donated Rs 100000 ($8500) for the Cape Town water crisis on behalf of both the national sides.

 
 Kohli stressed the importance of getting involved in the campaign. “Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and whenever we visit and play at Newlands, we are treated extremely well by the local people. By creating awareness of the drought, we are playing our part in highlighting the drought so people can see the seriousness of what’s taking place in the Mother City,” commented Kohli.
 
 The cheque was handed over to the Gift of the Givers (GoG) - a charitable organization - during the last T20 International at Newlands last Sunday. GoG will use the fund to drill boreholes in the severely hit areas and supply bottled water to affected organizations.
