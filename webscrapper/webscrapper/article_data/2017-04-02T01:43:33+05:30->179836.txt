Mumbai: For the first time since 2008, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has hiked the remuneration for examiners and others involved in the   and   examinations. The hike however has not gone well with the teachers.

 According to new rates, SSC and HSC examiners will get Rs 5 and Rs 6 respectively to correct a three-hour  . This is up by just 0.75 paise from the earlier rates. The changes in other rates too have been similar.
 
 Teachers groups from across the city had been demanding an increase in remuneration for the past few years. “The work of an examiner or exam conductor has increased ten-fold since the last time the remuneration was increased. Today, taking the public transport to the board office also costs more,” said Prashant Redij of Mumbai Principals Association.
 
 Teachers said they had been demanding a 100% hike at least. “A rupee’s increase would be justified only if the hikes were regular. As per the new rates, the moderators in fact will now get a lower remuneration,” said Anil Deshmukh, a junior college teacher. While moderators earlier got a fixed amount irrespective of number of papers they received, they too will be paid per paper from the coming year.
