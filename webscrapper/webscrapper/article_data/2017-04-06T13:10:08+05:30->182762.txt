PANAJI: Members of the All Goa Bar and Restaurant Owners’ association and the   urged liquor shop and bar owners to have faith in the present government even as liquor outlets remained close for the fifth day following the Supreme Court’s verdict of banning sale of alcohol within 500m of highways. 

 Addressing a large crowd of liquor traders, who have lost their livelihood, on Wednesday, spokesperson   blamed former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar for the current problem. 
 
 “People’s anger is evident. They have no other source of income. When we met Parsekar, there was no positive response from him. It may be because of him that the state did not approach the Supreme Court before the code of conduct came in place,” Palekar said, adding that the former chief minister made a statement asking affected parties to approach the apex court. 
 
 The association has now put in its faith in current chief minister  , demanding a leeway period till a permanent solution can be reached.
 
 “People don’t have resources to relocate. The government has to act immediately, but we have to give it a chance as it has prepare for the questions the Supreme Court will ask. We trust Manohar Parrikar completely,” he said. 
 
 President of the state’s Liquor Traders Association, Dattaprasad Naik, said that the government has already initiated multiple plans to safeguard the interest of stakeholders. 
 
 “December 15 was a black day for the people of Goa. At the time nobody realized the seriousness of the issue, and then the code of conduct came into effect, which rendered any political support to our cause impossible. The state government has now already started work of denotification of highways,” he said. 
 
 The crowd was far from pleased by the assurances given by senior members of the associations. Many people protested as the event drew to a close without their grievances being heard and questioned association leaders for not taking any action for the last three months.
