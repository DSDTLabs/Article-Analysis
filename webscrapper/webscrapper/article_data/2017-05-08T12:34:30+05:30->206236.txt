NEW DELHI: Former cabinet minister Kapil   has decided to lodge a complaint with Anti-Corruption Branch on Monday regarding the corruption charges levelled by him on Arvind   and Satyendar Jain. He also plans to give   information about the role of two people working in the CM office in the water tanker scam.

 In a series of tweets posted in the evening, Mishra said that he will be going to ACB on Monday at 11am. He had earlier tweeted: “The day Satyendar Jain will go to jail, each of my allegations will be proven right. It is just a matter of time.”
 
 Mishra also challenged senior AAP functionary   over his tweet stating that he firmly believes that Kejriwal cannot be involved in corruption. “The day Satyendar Jain goes to jail you will also have to believe me brother,” Mishra tweeted in response.
 
 Speaking to television channels on Sunday night, Mishra said, “I wrote to the ACB chief asking why there was delay in action on the fact finding report I had submitted on the water tanker scam. I submitted the report to chief minister   in August 2015. The letter to ACB is in the public domain. Why was no action taken on it and who were the people behind it?”
 
 The former minister also claimed that some people from AAP had called to tell him that Kejriwal will ask Jain to resign by Wednesday. “This is a sign that the victory of truth has started. If Jain goes to jail, you will know that I was right. If he manages to prove himself not guilty and does not face any action, then you can conclude that I was wrong,” Mishra added.
 
 On Saturday evening, Mishra had threatened a major expose. He had hinted that some new evidences in the water tanker scam brought out by him were the probable reasons for his removal from the cabinet. However, he stunned everyone on Sunday morning when he alleged corruption against Kejriwal and Jain.
