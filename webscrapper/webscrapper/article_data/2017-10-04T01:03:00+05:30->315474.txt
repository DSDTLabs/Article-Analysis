 Madurai: Dry days are not really dry in Madurai as   flows freely in many parts of the city as well as rural areas. Police continue to crack the whip on bootleggers on a routine basis and special drives are also undertaken during these days. However, it seems to have created little impact as bootleggers keep flouting rules and selling liquor. A large number of people were arrested for selling liquor on Gandhi Jayanthi, a dry day, both by the city as well as the district police.
 
 While the city police seized 437 bottles sold in the black market on Monday, it registered 13 cases and arrested 11 persons in connection with the crime. While three among the 13 cases were registered by prohibition and enforcement wing, the rest were by local police stations like Karimedu, Thirunagar, Tallakulam, Koodalpudur, Thideer Nagar and Subramaniyapuram. 
 
 Madurai district police conducted a crackdown on illegal liquor sales for four days including Monday. The drive which was taken up on instructions from district superintendent of police N Manivannan caught 236 persons illegally selling and hoarding liquor. As many as 3,032 liquor bottles, Rs 9,800 in cash, five two-wheelers and an autorickshaw used for bootlegging were also seized. 
 
 A police officer said that a majority of the cases were booked on the dry day. Most of the seized bottles among the 3,000-odd ones were of 180 ml. The bootleggers preferred to hoard smaller bottles so that they need not invest much even while getting good margin on every bottle sold. Police said that in many cases the bootleggers were released on bail since the offence did not fall under the stringent sections of the law.
