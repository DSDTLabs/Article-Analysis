MUMBAI: The recent hardening of yields in the government securities ( ) market has forced the finance ministry to plan for a lesser borrowing amount in the first half of   2019 than the previous year, which could soften  . 

 
 The government plans to mop up Rs 2.9 lakh crore between April and September 2018, compared to Rs 3.72 lakh crore during the same period of the current fiscal. 
 
 On Monday, the finance ministry’s department of economic affairs secretary   said the government will borrow about 48% of its total planned amount of nearly Rs 6.1 lakh crore. In the last few years, the government had front-loaded its borrowing programme with up to 65% of the total amount being raised in the first half of the fiscal. 
 
 The Centre’s decision to front-load its borrowing programme in the previous fiscals would leave enough room for states to borrow more in the second half of the fiscal without impacting the gilt yields much. However, as the prevailing higher yield in the G-sec market would put a larger interest burden on the Centre for what it borrows from the market, the government has decided to reduce this in the first half of FY19, starting April 1. In addition to long-dated papers of five years’ tenure and longer, Garg said the government would also issue gilts of one to four years’ duration, inflation-indexed   linked to consumer inflation and flexible rate bonds.
 
 Bond dealers said that the government’s borrowing programme will have a positive impact with the benchmark yield expected to fall near the 7.45% level soon from its Monday close at 7.62%. “If managed well, it could even fall to 7.25% level,” a dealer with a domestic bond house said.
