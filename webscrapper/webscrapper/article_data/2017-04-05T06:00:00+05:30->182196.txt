Visakhapatnam: Consumers of Eastern Power Distribution of AP Limited (APEPDCL) in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari districts should lodge complaints with the nearest Mee Seva centre if they come across problems in power supply, said chairman-cum-managing director MM Nayak on Tuesday. He further said the received complaints will be handed over to the concerned discom staff and rectification measures will be taken up within 12 hours in urban and 24 hours in rural areas. “Transformers will be repaired or replaced depending on the extent of damage and power will be restored without any delay,” Nayak added. “In the summer, it is common for transformers to break down due to severe heat conditions and abnormal power consumption in the concerned areas. Field staff of the respective areas have been instructed to attend to such issues immediately and restore power at the earliest,” he said.
