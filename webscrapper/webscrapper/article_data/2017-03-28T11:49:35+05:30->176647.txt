BHUBANESWAR:   government on Tuesday received early morning jitters when external affairs minister   informed chief minister   about reported abduction of a Canadian tourist in Maoist-hit   district. Odisha government had reasons to worry as two Italian tourists—Paolo Bosusco and Claudio Colangelo were kidnapped by Maoists in Kandhamal district in March 2012.
 
 As Sushma’s tweet and her subsequent phone call to Naveen had the Odisha Police on toes, the cops heaved a sigh of relief after learning that the foreigner went missing in Sukma region of neighbouring Chhattisgarh. “We already informed the external affairs ministry about the development. We promptly inquired and came to know that the foreigner John Szlalzak from Canada was untraceable in Sukma since Monday evening. He did not visit Odisha,” director general of police   told TOI.
  
  
  
 Singh said the 25-year-old overseas tourist reached Mumbai on February 14 on a tourist visa and has since been moving around India in a bike. “We came to know that he came to India to taste adventure. In Mumbai, he approached a travel agent, who arranged bike expedition tour for the foreigner. We are in touch with our Chhattisgarh counterpart to know about the development,” Singh said.
