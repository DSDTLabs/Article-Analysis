Ludhiana: Cow cess will be imposed on electricity bills with the technical advisory committee giving the go ahead to the municipal corporation. The department will now write to the Powercom department for implementation of the cess, which will be imposed at a rate of 2 paise per unit on electricity bills. The idea is to generate more funds to take care of stray cattle. 

 MC officials proposed imposition of cow cess on electricity bills in 2015 as well but the MC house dropped the agenda at the time. Cow cess was imposed on registration of vehicles, birth and death certificates, booking of marriage palaces and TS-1 certificates. However, no decision has been taken on collection of cow cess through cement bags and liquor. 
 
 MC senior veterinary officer Dr Y P Singh said, “As per government instructions, we will impose cow cess on electricity bills. This has already been implemented in the MCs of Bathida and Mohali.” He said they called public objections in September 2017 but did not receive a single objection. 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they have given the nod for imposition of cow cess on electricity bills and now they will send a copy of this resolution to the electricity department for implementation. He said very nominal charges have been fixed so that people are not burdened. 
 
 MC recovered around Rs 2.66 crore from cow cess 
 
 The MC recovered around Rs 2.66 crore from cow cess through various means of which they have spent Rs 92.13 lakh. Most of the money has been paid to the cow shed management to lift and take care of stray cattle. TAC members also approved the purchase of a cattle-lifting van priced at Rs 17.32 lakh. Tenders for fabrication of the cattle lifting van were issued and the MC will now be able to catch stray animals on its own.
