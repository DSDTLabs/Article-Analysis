BENGALURU: One had 49 cases, including murder, dacoity and robbery registered against him, and the other was a murder accused. When they met in   (Parappana Agrahara), they had something in common. Both wanted to put a stop to their criminal life and start afresh. 

  When they came out, they joined hands to start a business for which they needed Rs 2 lakh. With no cash in hand, the two ventured into robbery again. But their free run ended recently; both are now cooling their heels in jail. 
 
 Jabiuddin Mohammed Nuruddin alias Jaibuddin alias Tabrez, 30, and his associate   alias   Kumar, 36, of Mahalakshmi Layout, allegedly robbed 29 women of gold chains between March and June 30 this year. Police have recovered 1.2 kg of gold worth Rs 35 lakh from them. 
 
 The two told cops that they needed money to develop an app with details of all private schools in and around Bengaluru. A software developer told them it would cost more than Rs 2 lakh. 
 
  Nuruddin now has 78 cases booked against him. 
 
 
 
  Tech-savvy A run Kumar, who used to watch crime shows on TV, suggested his partner that using a stolen vehicle for robbery is a good idea to hoodwink police. As per the plan, Arun stole a gearless scooter parked outside an eatery in Malleswaram and fixed a duplicate licence plate of a similar vehicle listed for sale on an online website. 
 
 "There was a spur in chain-snatching cases in south and west Bengaluru. A special team headed by   south S D Sharanappa was formed which finally managed to nab the duo," police commissioner Praveen Sood said. 
 
 With this arrest, 12 chain-snatching cases in south, nine in west, six in north and one each in northeast and southeast divisions were solved, Sharanappa said.
