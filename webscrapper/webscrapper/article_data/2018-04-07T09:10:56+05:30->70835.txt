Healthy older adults can generate just as many new   as younger people, researchers have found for the first time.

 
 There has been controversy over whether adult humans grow new neurons, and some research has previously suggested that the adult brain was hard-wired and that adults did not grow new neurons. The new study, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, counters that notion. 
 
 The findings suggest that many senior citizens remain more cognitively and emotionally intact than commonly believed, said  , an associate professor at   in the US. “We found that older people have similar ability to make thousands of hippocampal new neurons from progenitor cells as younger people do,”   said.
 
 “We also found equivalent volumes of the hippocampus (a brain structure used for emotion and cognition) across ages. Researchers, including those from  , found that even the oldest brains they studied produced new brain cells.
