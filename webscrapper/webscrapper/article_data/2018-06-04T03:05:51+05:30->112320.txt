The poll panel formed four teams, consisting of two members each, to probe the matter soon after a   delegation approached it on the issue. The teams have to submit a report by June 7.

 
 Earlier in the day, Congress claimed there were at least 60 lakh bogus voters in the state, which would go to polls in November. The party also submitted ‘evidence’ to the EC to buttress its allegation.
 
 The terms of reference of the EC teams include inquiring into each specific issues raised in Congress complaint, finding out ‘alleged fake voters’ names, if any’, pinpointing ‘how did it happen’ and fixing responsibility to initiate appropriate action.
 
 “We have provided evidence to the EC. There are approximately 60 lakh fake voters registered in the state. These are not merely mistakes. The lists have been deliberately altered at the behest of   government in the state,” MP Congress chief Kamal Nath said.
 
 “How is it possible that the state’s population has increased by 24% but the number of voters has gone up by 40%,” he asked.
 
 The EC teams will visit Narela, Bhojpur, Seoni-Malwa and Hoshangabad assembly seats to ascertain how the discrepancies occurred. After reaching the state on Monday, the teams would fix responsibility for multiple and fake entries, the EC said.
 
 The EC decision to form the teams came hours after Congress submitted a memorandum to the poll panel along with instances of multiple entries of the same voter with different names in a given assembly constituency as well as those of one voter listed in multiple assembly constituencies.
 
 Congress has sought the removal of all duplicate entries in the electoral rolls of 230 assembly constituencies to conduct free and fair elections.
