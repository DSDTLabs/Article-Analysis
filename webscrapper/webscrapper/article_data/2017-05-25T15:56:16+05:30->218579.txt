INDORE: The much awaited Sailani Tapu – an island near   temple in Khandwa district was finally opened for public on Wednesday after several speculations and inordinate delay. State minister for tourism and culture Surendra Patwa inaugurated the island through video conferencing from Bhopal. 

 Developed at a cost of around Rs10.5 crore, the island (in backwater of   dam) has accommodation facilities like cottages and one restaurant to offer a relaxing holiday trip to visitors. In addition to this, the island also has recreational facilities like water-based activities including 2 speed boats and one mid-size cruise boat (Jal Pari). 
 
 “This new island is full of natures’ beauty and water sports. Also we have developed 19 cottages at the island to accommodate tourists who wish to stay,” said State Tourism Development Corporation Ltd’s regional manager SK Gupta. 
 
 He said that this island was a part of their mega project to develop new tourist spots on the banks of Narmada river. “We have provided all facilities for visitors including water sports boat club, cruise and water riders,” he added.
 
 The corporation has started bookings for the island from Wednesday. Cottages are available on both deluxe and premium packages of which the range starts from Rs 5990 to Rs 8990 for couple or two persons. The rates are exclusive of taxes. 
 
 Spread over 5-acre of land, this island is surrounded by Narmada water from three sides. This is the second water sports tourist destination after Hanuwantia Island in backwater of   dam. 
 
 Opening of this Island was earlier delayed owing to several reasons. Among the major ones include rise in level of backwater which had caused water-logging on the main approach road of the island. The corporation also had plans to provide a houseboat facility for visitors. However, plans for the same could not be worked out.
