CHARMINAR:   and   from Balapur and   of Maheshwaram constituency have lodged a police complaint, saying they have not received their pensions for six months.

 Scores of pensioners have registered their protest against officials at the   at   ward office seeking clarification for delay in the disbursement of monthly pension.
 
 “I am not getting my pension for the last seven months. Though I called and kept waiting here for hours, I was sent back with hollow words. It has been the same story for the last seven months. No one is in a mood to hear our pleas. We have made several rounds from Shaheen Nagar to Balapur for ₹1,000 monthly pension,” said Noor Bi, a widow pensioner from Shaheen Nagar.
 
 Saroonagar mandal vice chairman Omer Bin Abdul Aziz Boam told TOI the matter was brought to the notice of authorities several times, but no initiative was taken.
 
 “Most of the pensioners have not been given monthly pension. Though their thump impressions are taken every four to six months, they are given only one or two-month pension, saying their dues will be cleared in the coming months. However, all the officials concerned with this were informed abou the situation, and they have been requested many times to look into the matter, but nothing was done to help the pensioners,’’ Omer Bin Abdul Aziz Boam said.
 
 Pensioners also complained that they don’t get basic facilities like water and toilet facilities at the centres. Balapur SHO S Mohan Reddy said a case was registered in this regard and that the investigation was on. The pensioners appealed to the Telangana government to ensure monthly pensions are sent to their banks accounts and put an end to their queuing up at the post office.
