New Delhi:   vice-president   Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra on Monday hurled barbs at AAP chief Arvind   over bribery allegations.

 Tagging a report about ousted AAP minister Kapil Mishra’s allegations that Kejriwal took Rs 2 crore from Delhi minister Satyender Jain, Rahul tweeted, “The thing I like about the truth is, it has a habit of coming out.”
 
 In a gleeful message on Facebook, Vadra said, “What goes around comes around.” Vadra added that people who had levelled baseless allegations against him since 2010 were facing a similar plight, with the difference that the accuser in their case was a close aide who claimed to have substantial proof to back his charges.
 
 The twin attack from the Congress stable is significant as Rahul and Vadra have been at the receiving end of Kejriwal’s aggressive accusations, with the AAP chief once even dubbing Rahul as inept on national television.
 
 While the jibes betrayed an attempt to draw pleasure from Kejriwal’s discomfiture over graft charges, it also makes political sense for Congress to seize upon the opening provided by AAP’s woes which started with its defeat in Punjab assembly elections and intensified with the newbie’s decimation in Delhi local body polls.
 
 AAP has risen in the capital at the cost of Congress. While the new party even thrashed   on its way to pole position in the 2015 Delhi polls, Congress was pushed to the brink of an existential crisis with the bulk of its support base shifting to Kejriwal.
 
 Congress strategists believe the party can return to contention in Delhi politics only with a dip in AAP’s appeal.
 
 Interestingly, Vadra cited his own case to say that he had been a victim of political and media campaign but wished that Kejriwal “comes out clean for the sake of the people who believed in him” and “also for the respect of his immediate family, especially the children, for whom such trials by media of those they love and look up to are painful and sad”.
