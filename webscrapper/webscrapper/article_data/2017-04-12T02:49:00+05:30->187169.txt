Mumbai: While the   emphasized on the agenda of ‘transparency’ in the 2017 BMC elections, but its 31 corporators asked only three questions on the theme between March 2012 and December 2016. 

 In a new segment introduced this year, the NGO Praja analysed the election manifestos of political parties like the BJP and   presented prior to the BMC elections held in February 2017 and how many questions their corporators raised over the issues, which were mentioned in their manifestos.
 
 Milind Mhaske, project director of the NGO, said that it’s not just using the word ‘transparency’ in committee meetings but they have looked at it in a broader sense. “We have broad based the manifesto points and looked at whether or not corporators raised the issue with regards to the points listed out in the manifesto,” said Mhaske.
 
 Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena, which in its manifesto had promised waiving property tax for houses less than 500 sq ft, had asked only five questions on the topic in the last five years.
