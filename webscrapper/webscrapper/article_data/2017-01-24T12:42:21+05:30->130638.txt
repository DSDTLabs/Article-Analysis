CHENNAI: It's not every day that you see ace Indian spinner   avail public transport in Chennai. However, Monday was an exception. Ashwin, who landed in the city on Monday evening after being rested for the England T20s, found himself in a spot as his car couldn't make it to the airport to pick him up because of the ongoing Jallikattu protest.

 It was around 5.30pm when he arrived at the airport and sources close to Ashwin indicated that the 30-year-old initially thought of making it back home alone after coming to know that his car was stuck in Ashok Nagar. But he decided against it because of security concerns. With all roads leading up to Mount Road, the arterial road that connects the city to the airport, being blocked, Ashwin finally opted to use the service of Metro Railway with the “timely help“ from city police and a friend.
 
 Ashwin, who bagged the ICC cricketer of the year in 2016, was thankful to the city police. “When my manager contacted the police for security, they offered support immediately . I want to thank the assistant commissioner of police   and the CISF personnel (two escorts) for their timely help and the manner in which they made me feel comfortable. It was great travelling with fellow Chennaiites in the  ,“ Ashwin told TOI.
