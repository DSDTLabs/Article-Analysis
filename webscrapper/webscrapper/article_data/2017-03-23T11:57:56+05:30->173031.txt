MUMBAI: While announcing that it has doubled the Annual Retainership fee of India's 32 centrally-contracted cricketers with the   on Wednesday, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) threw in a 'mystery delivery' too.

 Surprisingly, this list doesn't include batsman  , who cracked a match-winning 63 in Bangalore in the last T20 International that India played - against England in the decider of that series. Raina isn't a part of the Test and ODI squads anymore, but the 30-yearold's sudden exclusion from the scheme of things is mystifying. Since his Bangalore knock, the left-hander has been conspicuous by his absence in domestic tournaments - he didn't play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 and Vijay Hazare one-dayers, and wasn't picked in the Deodhar Trophy squads either.
 
 The decision to award fresh contracts to the players was taken in consultation with the three-member national selection committee, which means UP southpaw Raina's hopes for a berth in India's Champions Trophy squad, barring an exceptional IPL, are slim. Clearly, there's more to the `Raina riddle' than meets the eye.
 
 Meanwhile, the Grade 'A' players would now thus get Rs 2 crore as compared to the earlier Rs 1 crore, while Grade 'B' and 'C' players will get Rs 1 crore and Rs 50 lakh respectively. The match fee for Tests has been hiked to Rs 15 lakh per match from Rs 7.50 lakh earlier, while ODI and T20 Internationals will make them richer by Rs 6 lakh and 3 lakh respectively. All the payments will be in effect from October 1, 2016.
 
 The man who's enjoyed the biggest promotion and pay hike is allrounder  , who, after being elevated from Grade 'C,' where he was earning Rs 25 lakhs, has earned an increment of Rs 1.75 crore after making it to Grade 'A'.
