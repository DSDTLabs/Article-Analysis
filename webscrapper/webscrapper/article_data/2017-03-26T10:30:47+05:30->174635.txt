INDORE: Policemen in Indore are now getting   while putting in long and strenuous hours at work from celebrity fitness trainer  , who advised them to adopt a rice-rich menu in their daily diet plan.

 Capadia, who held a three-hour long seminar for around 250 policemen, including inspectors, was summoned especially to find ways to keep Indore police personnel fit and active on duty. He was roped in by   after shocking facts surfaced during a recent health camp held for policemen.
 
 “Cops between the age of 35 and 40 were diagnosed with either   (at the camp). So, we have invited Kaizzad Capadia to develop awareness among the policemen,” said Mishra told TOI.
 
 Many of the policemen were diagnosed with hypertension due to work pressure and irregular lifestyle. Skin related diseases were also found in the traffic personnel during the health camp. 
 
 Capadia told the policemen ways to enhance fitness levels, starting with their diet plans. “If you want to lead a fit life, go for rice. It is more beneficial for the body. Wheat, broom corn (Juar) and pearl millet (bajra), are not as healthy as rice. People would not agree with me, but it is scientific and proven,” the celebrity trainer said.
 
 “What will we eat then? How can we work out a balance between eating good (which requires considerable investment) and put in serious hours of work”: was a question asked at the fitness trainer from most quarters.
 
 Capadia asked the policemen to include more fibre and proteins in their daily diet and have a regular schedule for exercise.
 
 “This is the first round of fitness seminar, which is basically to motivate and fill the need-gap. Diet prescription, exercising and monitoring would be the later steps,” said the fitness expert.
 
 He was of the opinion that muscle-building exercises should be adopted because as the age increases, people would need physical strength.
