RAMNAGAR: Addressing an election rally in   constituency in Nainital district on Tuesday,   national president Amit Shah said that his party, if voted to power, would provide jobs to the youths of the hill state so that they don't have to migrate to big cities outside the state in search of employment. He also said that “unlike the Congress, BJP understands and feels the pain of the hills.”
 
  “BJP will ensure development of various sectors such as tourism, develop IIT parks for youths so that they can compete with the rest of world and encourage farmers to grow medicinal plants to boost their income,” said Shah.
  
  Praising the Modi government at the Centre, Shah urged the people of Uttarakhand to vote for change so that the destiny of the state takes a new shape. “I urge the people of Devbhumi to bring in a government which will make this beautiful state the most developed one. Vote for the government which ensures ‘pahad ka paani and pahad ki jawani’ and serves the people of the hills,” added Shah, invoking the pride of the hills.
  
  Saying that Congress is neck deep in corruption, Shah mentioned the sting operation case involving Harish Rawat and said the CM openly tried to do horse trading to garner support of MLAs in the assembly. Shah said the secretary was also seen in a sting video negotiating with the liquor mafia. 
  
  Shah said a large number people of the hill state have sacrificed their youth to defend the country by joining the armed forces, and hence the Modi government accepted OROP.
