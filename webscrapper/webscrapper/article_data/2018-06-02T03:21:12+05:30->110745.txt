NEW DELHI: If your   is confiscated by the traffic police, soon you won’t have to wait for months to get it back. The   is centralising the process of returning confiscated licences to their registered addresses through Speed Post.

 Currently, if a driver is caught speeding or jumping a red light, traffic cops suspend the licence for three months as per the  . However, a violator generally doesn’t get it back after three months. The lack of coordination between traffic cops and the   often adds another three months to their wait time. 
 
 The result: Almost five lakh drivers are found driving without a licence in the capital. Drivers complain that one has to go to the transport authority several times just to find out whether the traffic police has sent the licence to it. 
 
 A department official said a software had been developed to centralise the process. A confiscated licence is now sent by the traffic police to the related regional transport office and often even get misplaced. Last year, the department handled at least 53,000 seized licences. 
 
 “We have made a deputy commissioner in charge of a driving licence suspension unit, while a motor licensing officer will have the exclusive charge of handling suspended licences,” the official said.
 
 All confiscated licences will now come to the unit located at the department’s headquarters, which will also send showcause notices to the violators, he added. Regular SMSs will also be sent to the registered mobile numbers of the violators.
