Jaipur: Electronic or e-way bill system for inter-state movement of goods was introduced on Sunday across the country including Rajasthan. The e-way bills generated on the first day on April 1 close to 21,000, the 5th largest in the country. Commissioner of state commercial taxes department Alok Gupta said that after a week or 10 days the bills are expected to cross 40,000.

 However, he said the first priority is to facilitate the smooth functioning of the system so that all the businesses and the transporters use the e-way bill without any hassles.
 
 “Prior to the rollout, we conducted workshops and awareness camps along with the industry associations and group. The field offices of commercial tax department have also been sensitized to address any problems that the businesses might face. So far, we have not received any complaints and it’s been smooth,” said Gupta.
 
 The maximum number of e-bills generated on the first day was in Gujarat at over 37,000 followed by Maharashtra (32,000), Karnataka (30,000), Haryana, (21,000). On Sunday alone, 688 new people registered for e-way bill portal, taking the total number to close to 70,000 in Rajasthan.
 
 Gupta said the facilitation process will continue till it gets streamlined and after that we will look at enforcement.
 
 Asked if there is still scope for businesses to move goods out of the state without the e-way bill he said there is always a chance that such activities may escape surveillance but they cannot do that frequently. “Right now, we are focusing on facilitation. When we reach the enforcement stage, we have an efficient mechanism to check illegal transportation of goods,” added Gupta.
