Guntur: Rattled by the diarrhoea outbreak, the state government has put the city civic administration on  . The government has directed the municipal commissioner to take all steps to prevent the spread of diarrhoea on a war-footing basis. The state deputed eight municipal commissioners to the city to oversee the sanitation works.

 Director of municipal administration (DMA) K Kanna Babu made a whirlwind tour in the city on Friday along with the city municipal commissioner. Later Babu rushed municipal commissioners from Tenali, Chilakaluripet, Piduguralla, Vinukonda, Addanki, Nuzvid, Tadepalle and Mangalagiri to Guntur city. He took stock of the situation with the engineering wing officials and senior officials deputed from other towns. He appointed the municipal commissioners from other towns as special officers exclusively handle the sanitation and shifting of drinking water pipelines.
 
 Babu said additional sanitation staff from Ongole and other municipal towns would be deputed to Guntur to keep the entire city clean. He asked the senior officials to regularly inspect areas which are under their jurisdiction. “Shifting of drinking water pipelines from the drain network and keeping the city clean should be handled simultaneously,” he opined. 
 
 He warned that special officers would be held responsible if anything went wrong in their areas. He instructed the superintending engineer (SE) to personally monitor the pipeline shifting works in all the divisions that were hit by diarrhoea. He wanted the pipeline works to be completed in the next three to four days.
 
 Meanwhile, increasing number of diarrhoea cases is worrying hospital authorities as new cases are reporting from new colonies.
 
 While the urban administration has set its entire focus on One Town area, the latest diarrhoea cases are cropping up from other parts of the city.
