DUMKA: Chief minister   trained his guns on the JMM after a group of tribal women showed him black flags during his first election rally for the   at Kharouni on Wednesday.

 The women also shouted slogans against him and his decision to amend the Chhotagpur Plateau Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Acts.
 
 In his speech, Das blamed the JMM for the protest even as he campaigned for BJP candidate Hemlal Murmu. He said, “The JMM is instigating people to hold protests like this after having failed to mislead them on  .”
 
 Das added, “The JMM treats tribals only as a vote bank. It does not want to work for their social and economic development. That is why it is opposing the changes in the tenancy laws that are meant for consolidating the tribals’ land rights.” Most of those who attended the rally were tribals.
 
 While defending the amendments to the CNT and SPT Acts, Das said the JMM was solely responsible for the “miserable condition of people of the constituency, who are mostly tribals.”
 
 Referring to the display of black flags in the rally, Das said, “The Election Commission should take cognisance of such activities meant to disturb election meetings of rival parties.”
 
 Later, BJP’s spokesperson J B Tubid claimed that some of the protesters were drunk.
 
 Das addressed a series of meetings during the day in Gopikandar block under which Kharouni falls, and at Bohra and Chhoti Taalghati under Amrapara block. In his speeches, he said, “My government wants to remove Littipara from the list of the country’s 10 most underdeveloped blocks. For this, we had planned a string of development projects for Littipara much before the assembly seat fell vacant.” He added, “I have visited Littipara so many times and I have done so to help its people improve their living condition and not seek their votes.”
 
 Das will camp in Pakur till Friday to lead his party’s campaign.
