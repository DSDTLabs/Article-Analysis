'OK Jaanu', starring   and   in lead roles, hit theatres nationwide on Friday. After recording an average opening at the domestic box-office with a collection of Rs 4.08 crore, the film has maintained its steady pace by adding an estimated Rs 4.90 crore to its kitty, thus taking the total collection to Rs 8.98 crore. 

 The film marks the second joint outing of Aditya and Shraddha post the success of 'Aashiqui 2'. While the 2013 love story garnered rave reviews, 'OK Jaanu' opened to mixed reviews when it released across 1400 screens in the country. It remains to be seen whether the romantic drama sees an upward trend on Sunday. The film might face some competition from Deepika Padukone's Hollywood release 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' and Nawazuddin Siddiqui's low-budget film 'Haraamkhor', both of which released alongside the love story. 
 
  
  
 'OK Jaanu' is an official remake of Mani Ratnam's romantic flick 'OK Kanmani', which has been directed by Ratnam's prot'g' Shaad Ali. The film delves into the joys, emotions and confusions of today's youth as they grapple with relationships.
