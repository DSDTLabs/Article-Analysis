TRICHY: The cold war between functionaries of the AIADMK and the TTV Dhinakaran-led   came to the fore with supporters of both groups indulging in a verbal duel while garlanding the statue of   on his 127th birth anniversary here on Saturday. 

 It all began when the groups led by the urban district secretary of AIADMK P   and urban district secretary of AMMK, J Seenivasan chanced upon each other near the Ambedkar statue near Aristo Roundabout on Saturday afternoon. The AMMK functionaries and the supporters had already garlanded the statue and they were about to leave the place, when the AIADMK men accompanied by state ministers Vellamandi M   and S   reached the spot. 
 
 Some of the supporters of the AIADMK leaders asked the functionaries of AMMK to give way to their group. This turned into a heated argument. With the verbal duel about to turn into a scuffle, the police team deputed for security intervened into the matter and pacified both the groups, following which they dispersed. 
 
 Ever since Kumar took charge as district secretary in March this year, his supporters reportedly roped in some of the supporters of Dhinakaran to join the AIADMK in Trichy. Denying the news, a senior functionary in the TTV group on condition of anonymity said that their team was intact. He also claimed that several of the functionaries and cadres in AIADMK switched to AMMK due to difference of opinion. However, Kumar claimed that his party witnessed a steady inflow of members from all parties. TNN
