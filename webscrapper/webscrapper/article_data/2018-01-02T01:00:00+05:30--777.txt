PATNA: The Bihar-Jharkhand regional office of Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday ordered provisional attachment of properties worth Rs4.23 crore belonging to Bharat Yadav, a   hailing from Munger.

 Properties apart, an LIC policy of Rs29 lakh would also be attached.
 
 Sources at ED’s regional office at Patna said an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) -- the ED equivalent of a police FIR — was lodged against Yadav in 2014 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.
 
 Sources said four plots of land worth Rs1.64 crore registered in the name of Yadav and 10 plots in his wife’s name could not be properly accounted for. Neither Yadav nor his wife could give proper explanation about the source of income for acquiring the property. The sources said the present market value of the plots could go as high as Rs10 crore.
 
 Sources said the statements of Yadav and his wife were recorded before issuing the attachment order. Yadav has been earlier booked for various criminal offences, including murder, forgery, criminal conspiracy and concealment of property, among others.
