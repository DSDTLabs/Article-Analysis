LUDHIANA: Ludhiana (Rural) police has booked four persons for allegedly being part of an   operating from jail. The accused were identified as   alias Lehmber of Sidhwan Bet, Mandeep Dhru of Daudar in Moga, Raja of Dhudike, and Lakha, a panchayat member from Nathowal.

 Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ludhiana Rural.  , said he had instructed district police to keep a vigil on the movements of Gurpreet Singh lodged in   jail, and also on his various accomplices with whom he was in regular touch on mobile. He added that they came to know the accused was running an extortion racket from the jail premises, along with his various accomplices, after which Lehmber was brought on production warrant and interrogated. 
 
 “On investigation, Lehmber disclosed startling facts that he — along with Mandeep Dhru, who is also in Sangrur jail in a murder case — had established a kabaddi academy managed by Raja and Lakha. Various kabaddi teams have joined their academy. These teams participate in various kabaddi tournaments, and they from inside jail threaten the opposite team players and decide the outcome of match. Thus, they decide the winning team and the prize money that the winning team gets is partially sent to them,” said the SSP.
 
 The police officer said that following the disclosure by Lehmber, a case under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) was registered against them. He added that raids were being conducted to nab the accused persons not in jail, and more revelations were expected in the case after they are arrested.
