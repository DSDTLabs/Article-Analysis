KOLKATA: A parcel van of the 13007 Udyan   from Howrah on Monday caught fire between the   and Thaparnagar stations in Jharkhand. Loco pilot Bidyut   spotted the fire around 4pm and stopped the train before it could spread to the passenger coaches. Mondal detached the parcel van (the first one after the locomotive) from the rest of the train with the help of other train staffers.

 “Power had to be turned off in that section as there was a risk of the fire spreading to the overhead wires. A diesel engine from Mugma later hauled the passenger coaches back to the starting station. Services resumed in the section after the fire was put out. An inquiry has been ordered,” an ER official said.
 
 ER has also commended the prompt action of the train crew and announced a cash award of Rs 5,000.
