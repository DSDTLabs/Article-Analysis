CHANDIGARH: Teachers of government schools will have to take remedial classes from Monday, confirmed district education officer Anujit Kaur.

 Till last week teachers had been protesting against   education departments order on conducting remedial classes for students of Classes X and XII in summer vacations.
 
 According to officials from education department, those who will not take the classes will face action.
 
 Poor results in classes X and XII had forced the education department to ask all government school teachers to take remedial classes so that the students with compartment pass. In Class X, the result had gone down by 1%, while in Class XII almost 50% of students failed in government schools.
 
 Teachers, however, said the result was poor as the department takes most of their class time by assigning non-academic duties. They also blamed the no detention policy and the practice of giving grace marks.
 
 “Till Class VIII, no student can be failed and to improve results they ask us to give grace marks to students in Class IX. It is for the department to introduce boards in classes V and VIII,” said  , president,  .
 
 A message has also been circulated by teachers asking others to refuse non-academic duties. It reads, “Poor result of X and XII led to the outburst of secretary, education, director school education and school heads on teachers. Vacations cancelled, showcases issued to teachers......All are seeing the effect but not the cause! When No-detention policy proved a disaster, no action was taken against legislature and Central government! When school heads forced teachers to pass students in Class IX under knowledge of higher officials of education department, no action was taken... Wake up teachers!”
