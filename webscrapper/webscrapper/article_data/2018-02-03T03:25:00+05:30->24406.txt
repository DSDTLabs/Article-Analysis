Panaji: Goa traffic cell receives on an average 1,000 complaints per day from around 1,500 citizen sentinels linked to its WhatsApp platform under the traffic sentinel scheme. Informing that the sentinel scheme has been receiving good response from people, superintendent of police (traffic) Dinraj Govekar said that the cell sometimes receives 300 cases of violations from a single sentinel. “The violators are then issued notices under the Motor Vehicle Act and asked to settle charges at traffic cell headquarters in Altinho, Panaji’’ he said. In view of several violations being registered and inconvenience caused to the erring riders, an extension counter has been opened in South Goa, at the office of the DySP (Traffic), Margao, to compound the cases.  On November 10, director general of police (DGP) Muktesh Chander had launched the scheme wherein citizens could report traffic violations on WhatsApp and earn cash rewards.  Under the initiative, citizens can send photos and videos of the violations along with the details of the erring vehicle to contact number 7875756110.  Based on the type of violation, the user is entitled to certain points. For instance, reporting a violation of triple-seat riding on a two-wheeler will earn them 10 points, while parking on footpaths or zebra crossings will accrue three points.  On accumulating 100 points, the user can claim a reward of Rs 1,000. A lucky draw will also be held, wherein a sentinel may win either a motorcycle or a car.
