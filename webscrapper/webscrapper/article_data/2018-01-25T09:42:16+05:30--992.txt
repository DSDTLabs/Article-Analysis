 may not have managed to counter Chung, but he came prepared for his post-match conference. The 26-year-old's contentious stand on social media was questioned by the press, following his win over the world No.5 Dominic  , sparking a series of stories.

 Incidentally, no sooner had Sandgren walked onto court for his last-eight clash,   tweeted 'turn channel'.
 
 On Wednesday, Sandgren read from a prepared text he had on his phone: "You seek to put people in these little boxes so that you can order the world in your already assumed preconceived ideas. You strip away any individuality for the sake of demonizing by way of the collective. With a handful of follows and some likes on Twitter, my fate has been sealed in your minds. To write an edgy story, to create sensationalist coverage, there are a few lengths you wouldn't go to mark me as the man you desperately want me to be. You would rather perpetuate propaganda machines instead of researching information for a host of angles and perspectives while being willing to learn, change, and grow. You dehumanize with pen and paper and turn neighbor against neighbor. In so doing, you may actually find you're hastening the hell you wish to avoid, the hell we all wish to avoid.' This stopped being about tennis."
