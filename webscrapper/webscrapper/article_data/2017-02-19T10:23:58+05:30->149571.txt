KOLHAPUR: The   ( ) is planning alternate day water supply for the city this summer to ensure optimum pressure and equitable distribution in all areas, said an official on Saturday.

 “Currently, the water level in the dams is optimum but the demand increases for irrigation during summer. Also, an increase in evaporation due to intense heat leads to a decline in the water levels. In such a situation, we have to resort to alternate day supply,”  , chief hydraulic engineer of the KMC said. 
 
 Last year, the KMC was forced to initiate the alternate-day supply system for the first time ever from April. The measure was taken due to reduced water levels in the dams and declining levels in the   river. 
 
 The KMC saved over Rs 40 lakh during the three-month period of implementation of the system. It also helped save around 30% water and made it possible for the authorities to provide water to all areas at uniform pressure.
 
 Almost 30% of the city's areas, mostly the E-ward, receive water at a low pressure. The civic officials said that water pressure has increased after a major leakage at SIBER chowk was plugged.
 
 Last year, the corporators from the E-ward cutting across party lines supported the alternate day water supply scheme as citizens were happy after they started receiving water at good pressure. 
 
 However, the corporators from the internal areas of A, B and C wards opposed the move claiming that the citizens from the congested old city area did not have enough space to store water for 24 hours.
 
 “The E ward depends on water tankers most of the times. We have initiated the work to repair leakages and replace the old pipelines with new ones so that adequate water supply is possible in such areas. The idea will be presented before the corporators and suggestions will be invited before actual implementation begins,” said Kulkarni.
