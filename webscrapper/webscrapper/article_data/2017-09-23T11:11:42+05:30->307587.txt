CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district courts on Friday held an   guilty of murdering his compatriot in a city college.   was held guilty under Section 302 of the IPC and the quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Monday.

 The case dates back to March 2016, when Ehsanullah, 25, was booked and arrested on the complaint of another Afghan student, Didar, for murdering Sanaullah.   said there was a rivalry between the two students of Postgraduate Government College, Sector 46. He had said that Ehsanullah repeatedly stabbed Sanaullah, 25, in broad daylight on the campus in the presence of several college students and a teacher. “Ehsanullah entered the classroom on that fateful day and started punching   in his stomach and then stabbed him multiple times,” Didar’s police complaint said. 
 
 In the scuffle, Ehsanullah also sustained injuries, following which the police were informed and both were rushed to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32. Sanaullah succumbed to his injuries. Both the students had come on a scholarship sponsored by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. A college official said both were living in rented accommodations. While Ehsanullah lived in Sector 46, Sanaullah was a resident of Sector 33. 
 
 Didar said Ehsanullah and Sanaullah were friends and known to each other as they studied in the same college. Two days before the incident, he noticed ill-will between the two outside the mosque in Sector 45, Chandigarh. 
 
 The defence counsel argued that Ehsanullah was being implicated and it was he who was attacked. To support the argument, the defence presented a witness, who said even Ehsanullah received multiple injuries. The defence added that it was Sanaullah who started the conflict, which led to the scuffle. 
 
 After hearing the arguments, the court convicted Ehsanullah.
