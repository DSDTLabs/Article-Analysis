BHOPAL: As BJP-RSS combine started hectic preparations for the arrival of RSS chief   and some top leaders of the organisation, state Congress president Arun Yadav levelled a sensational allegation through Twitter. 

 On Saturday morning, Yadav tweeted, "RSS chief visits to the state or big RSS shows are coincidental to rise of communal tension. Records prove."
 
 Speaking to TOI, he said, "History has it that RSS has strategised and implemented communal disharmony to give political strength to the BJP. What is the reason that more than 60 years after formation of Sangh, there is still no membership list and no registration."
 
 BJP was quick to respond. Party's state spokesman Rahul Kothari issued a statement, saying, "An exercise of social harmony has been connected to communal tension. This shows Arun Yadav's understanding and perception of politics. The   is in the ICU in   and Yadav is on a ventilator. He should apologise for this comment."
