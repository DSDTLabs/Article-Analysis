GHAZIABAD: Whenever you walk through the roads of  , you can’t miss the numerous   installed at the street corners, near the crossroads, under the looming shadow of a tree or adjoining the boundary wall of an old society.

 These small stalls, which sell flowers like roses, orchids, carnations and marigold offer a welcome respite to the otherwise dull and unkempt streetsides and the bright colours catch the eye against the backdrop of broken pavements, open sewer lines, clogged drains and overflowing dustbins. “It feels refreshing to look at these shops while driving or during traffic jams, when the irritation gets to one’s head,” said Manoj Jain, a resident of Shipra Sun City. 
 
 Indirapuram houses more than 80 such makeshift flower shops, which have become an inseparable part of its landscape. The shops cater to every occasion and need, from birthdays, anniversaries and funeral rites to religious offerings and prayer ceremonies. “Such flower shops are also seen in some parts of south or west Delhi. It’s pleasant to see places like Indirapuram and Vaishali catching up,” said  , a resident.
 
  “We earn Rs 1,000-1,200 every day, but our work is seasonal in nature. The sale surges in December and January, which is the wedding season. We do business for about Rs 14,000-16,000 on Valentine’s Day,” Deepak Kumar, a flower vendor, said.
 
 Even though these shops have become popular, there are complaints about encroachments. “In so many places, these shops have been opened in the middle of cycle tracks. The government should keep this in mind and relocate them to a viable place designated to them,” said Sanju Mishra, a shopkeeper.
