As the first ever female host of the Screen Actors Guild awards, actress Kristen Bell avoided mentioning the 'elephant in the room' - myriad of sexual misconduct allegations facing Hollywood - during her opening monologue. But, the actress did make an impassioned plea for 'empathy and diligence'.
 

    

     





  She said, "It's a true privilege to experience and share the wide scope of humanity through storytelling. Everyone's story deserves to be told, especially now." "We are living in a watershed moment in time, and as we march forward with active momentum and open ears, let's make sure we are leading the charge with empathy and diligence, because fear and anger never win the race," added Bell.  The actress also poked fun at the First Lady of the United States Melania Trump and said that "it feels good to be the first lady at SAG awards."In a clear reference to Melania, the 'Frozen' star noted, "There has never been a host for this awards show before. It's the first time. First person. First lady. And I honestly never thought that I'd grow up to be the first lady, but you know what? I kind of like it. I think my first initiative as first lady will be cyberbullying."  But she ended her monologue with a big announcement and named that one thing for which we all can come together. "Regardless of our differences, we can all come together and delight in one thing - 'Frozen 2' is coming out in theaters in 2019," concluded Bell. The 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are being handed out at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
