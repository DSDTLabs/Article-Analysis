MUMBAI: With the BJP on Saturday deciding not to field its candidate in the mayor and deputy  , it's likely to be an easy win for the Shiv Sena, which has 84 corporators in the 227 member house. The BJP has 82 corporators and the support of two more corporators.

 On Saturday , the last day for filing nominations, the Sena fielded Vishwanath Mahadeshwar as its mayor candidate and   for the deputy mayor post. Mahadeshwar expressed confidence of winning the election. For, his only rival will be Congress candidate Vittal Lokare. The Congress, which has 31 corporators, has also fielded Vinni D'souza for the deputy mayor election.
 
 The Sena strategist and MLC Anil Parab was present in the BMC the entire day keeping a watch on the development in other parties. When chief minister   said the his party would not contest the elections, the announcement diminished the dream of smaller parties that were expecting to play kingmakers.
 
 After the mayor elections, the Sena's big challenge will be in running BMC statutory committees-the standing committee that clears funds for various projects and the improvement committee that deals with land related issues--where the party and BJP will have equal numbers of representatives. Both parties will have 10 members each in the two committees.The Congress will have three members. There will be three other members in each committee from the NCP, MNS and the SP.
 
 Officials said that in such a situation, the Sena will need to take the help of other parties to get its pet projects clear in case the BJP opposes them in the committee meetings.
