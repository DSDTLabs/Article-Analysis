CHARMINAR: Members of the   here on Sunday sought the immediate cancellation of the archaic Motor Transport Workers Act 1961& Rule 1963. They fear that the act may add to their financial woes.

 The request comes after the state transport and labour departments appealed to all motor transport employers and owners to follow Section (3) of the Motor Transport Workers Act 1961, under which every vehicle obtaining permission from transport department should also be registered with the labour department, and licences of registered vehicles must be renewed before December 1 every year, failing which officials can initiate legal action against violators. As per the Act, violators may have to cough up ₹500 as penalty or face three months imprisonment.
 
 “The south zone road transport authorities and labour department officials convened a meeting with all the lorry operators. In the meeting we were asked to follow the 1961 Act, which is a huge burden for us. This act should be cancelled as we can’t pay the fee for 10-15 yearold vehicles. If the officials ask us to follow rules then we will obey, but the act must be tweaked,’’ requested   Pasha.
 
 Association members told TOI that they have requested Chief Minister   to pay attention to problems faced by lorry owners immediately and ensure appropriate relaxation of the Act.
