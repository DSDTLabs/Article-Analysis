Nandita Swetha, who started off her career with Attakathi in Kollywood, in the role of a village belle, was seen in similar characters in subsequent films, too. The actress, who attempted something unique in Selvaraghavan’s  , is now donning the role of a cop in Selva’s  , which has   playing the lead. She says that it was a conscious decision to choose roles which are different from the ‘homely girl’ image she had, and avers that the film requires her to pull off stunt sequences.

 She says, “I play Sara, a bold and serious cop — I’m looking forward to the portions which will have me in action mode. The next schedule kicks off in a few weeks. Though I had to perform daring scenes in Nenjam Marappathillai, this one will be different.” 
 
 All excited about working with Arvind Swami, Nandita says that her friends were jealous of her when she told them about having bagged a chance to work with the Roja star. “I grew up watching his films and admiring him. It’s great to be a part of a project with him. However, I have no pair in this film. The movie is said to have ample suspense, emotional moments and thrills,” she says. Nandita is all set to join the Telugu remake of Sathuranga Vettai next month, after completing Vanangamudi.
