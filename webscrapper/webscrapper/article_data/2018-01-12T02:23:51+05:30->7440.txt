NEW DELHI: The special investigation team ( ) formed by the home ministry in February 2015 to re-investigate   cases scrutinised thousands of records of Delhi Police, CBI and police forces of other states and recorded statements of over 1,000   after which 291 cases were re-investigated. 

 Some of these witnesses, sources said, were traced after 32 years of the riots and were interviewed through video conferencing in places like Los Angeles and Pennsylvania in the US and the UK. Several people from across the country turned up voluntarily with information at its office in Lok Nayak Bhawan in the last two years.
 
 The panel, whose role came to an end with the   forming a new three-member SIT on Thursday, will prepare a report on the work done by it and send it to home minister Rajnath Singh.
 
 The panel included IPS officer Anurag, former district judge Rakesh Kapoor and Delhi Police’s additional DCP Kumar Gyanesh.
 
 The SIT questioned two prime suspects — former Congress leaders Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler — a couple of times. It couldn’t find either the victim, the complainant or their family members in 199 cases, sources said. “In some cases, we found that police were never able to identify the body after the riots so it was impossible after three decades to establish the identity of the deceased,” a home ministry official said.
 
 The panel, however, re-investigated 42 cases and filed chargesheets in six of them.
 
 Delhi Police had closed 241 cases citing lack of evidence. The Justice Nanavati Commission had recommended reopening only four of them. 
 
 The CBI had reopened and re-investigated the four cases. In two, the agency had filed chargesheets and in one, five persons, including a former MLA, were convicted. 
 
 A total of 3,325 people were killed in the anti-Sikh riots of which Delhi alone accounted for 2,733 deaths, while the rest took place in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states.
