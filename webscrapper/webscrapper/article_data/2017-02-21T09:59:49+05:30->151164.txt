INDORE: In a petition challenging policy of license renewal of   in state, the Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court asked the petitioner to file an affidavit giving details of how much he is willing to offer to the exchequer for a   shop, which is being currently run by an existing  . 

 Sunil Yadav had filed a petition before the high court challenging the government policy for renewal of bhang shop licenses, seeking to enter into the trade himself. The petition was heard on Monday by the division bench of   and Justice   Dubey, who granted the petitioner one day to file the affidavit. 
 
 The petition challenges the policy dated January 20, 2017, according to which existing bhang shop licenses will be renewed by the state government, with an annual increment of 10 percent in the license cost. 
 
 “We have claimed in this petition that government is facing a huge loss of revenue by not allowing auction of the existing shops and is also denying the rights of the citizen to enter a trade by putting off auction of new bhang shops in the state. For the past three years, no new auction of bhang shops were done, which has led to increase in the fierce monopoly in the trade,” Vikas Jaiswal, petitioner’s counsel said. 
 
 The state in its reply to the petition had claimed that no fundamental right of any citizen is being compromised through the policy as dealing in bhang, liquor and such intoxicating products is not a fundamental right in the Indian constitution. 
 
 The state has also said that the auctions are not held every year considering the possibility of no takers for the old shops, which in turn could lead to a greater revenue loss. The petition will now be heard by the court on February 22.
