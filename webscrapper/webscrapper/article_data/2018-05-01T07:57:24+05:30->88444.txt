VARANASI: Deputy chief minister   on Monday slammed SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s announcement of gifting free   to   toppers saying “nobody is stopping this man, who put the fate of lakhs of students of the state at stake by encouraging copying, from distributing laptops”.

 “It was Akhilesh government in the state that had made talented and meritorious students feel frustrated by promoting copying,” Maurya said reiterating that the PWD will fulfill its promise of constructing roads up to the residences of the students who have secured a place in UP Board merit list this year.
 
 “The foundation of such roads will also be laid by the students themselves,” he added while speaking to reporters here on Monday.
 
 Claiming that BJP’s popularity was increasing by the day, Maurya said, “Nobody in the state is in a better position than former CMs Akhilesh and   to tell who is really afraid of BJP’s increasing popularity.”
 
 Maurya also ridiculed claims of Akhilesh and Maya that BJP was afraid of SP and BSP coming together. “Formation of SP-BSP alliance is sufficient to reveal that who is really afraid of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity. Even after forming an alliance, they will not be able to stop BJP from winning over 73 seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,” he claimed.
