 mogul Jay-Z became headline fodder for cheating on his wife,  , and the rapper-singer believes they have tried to work on their relationship and are in a 'better place today'. 

  
  
  Speculation about the rapper's infidelity began in 2014 when a video surfaced of his sister-in-law   Knowles attacking him in an elevator. With Beyonce's 2016 record 'Lemonade,' which contained several semi-veiled references to cheating, those rumours gained steam. 
 
  Jay-Z finally admitted his transgression last year in a November interview.
 
  During an appearance on show, Jay-Z said he did not have the emotional tools required for a marriage, but through Beyonce's support, he is working toward achieving them. 
 
  For a lot of us, especially where I grew up and men in general, we don't have emotional cues from when we were young. Our emotional cue is 'Be a man. Don't cry'. I can't see them coming down my eyes, so I got to make the song cry. It was my way of saying I want to cry, I want to be open, I want to have the emotional tools that it takes to keep my family together. 
 
  "I have a beautiful wife who was understanding and who knew I'm not the worst of what I've done. We did the hard work of going to therapy. We love each other, so we really put in the work for years. I like to believe we're in a better place today. I'm proud of the father and the husband that I am today," Jay-Z said. 
 
  The duo, who first met in 2000, got married in April 2008. Their first child together, daughter  , was born in January 2012 and they welcomed twins in June last year.
