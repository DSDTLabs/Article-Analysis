KOLKATA: After his arrest near Acropolis mall, actor   was questioned by a special investigating team at the police station before being locked up. Cops granted him two “luxuries” — a mat to sleep on and a blower outside the cell to beat the heat.

 An officer said: “He refused dinner saying he had eaten at his residence. In the morning, too, he refused breakfast, subsisting only on tea and biscuits.” 
 
 Police sources said though Chatterjee remained calm when he was being brought to the police station, his patience ran out when he failed to connect with his lawyers. “He was mostly awake throughout the night. Our men found him sitting in a corner of the cell at one point. But he did not demand any special favours. There was a slight hesitation when he was asked to wear a dress for the night, but he accepted our offer. It was early in the morning that he connected with his lawyers and one of them visited him for around five minutes,” said an officer.
 
 In the morning, the actor was first taken to SSKM Hospital for a check-up and finally to Alipore court. Dressed in an orange-and-white T-shirt and jeans, he did not recoil when the media tried to get a photograph of him climbing off the prison van in ankle-deep water. The cops, though, did not take any chances as a sizeable crowd had gathered around the CJM court. He was not taken out of the central court lock-up even when the hearing came up at 3.25pm.
 
 Around 6pm, Chatterjee was asked by the additional OC — who is the chief investigating officer in this case — to get ready for a long session of questioning. “We asked him about the sequence of events as he was the only other occupant in the car. We wanted to ascertain his frame of mind just before and after the accident,” said a senior officer.
