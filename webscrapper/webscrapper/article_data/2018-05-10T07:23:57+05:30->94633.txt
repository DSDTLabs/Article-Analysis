PUNE: From 2018-19 academic year, students wishing to change college after Std XI will have to take admissions through online process. The system is being introduced to maintain transparency in admissions.

 
  
 
 First year junior college admissions are conducted through common admission process ( ), but it has been noticed that after Std XI, students randomly change colleges and the colleges do not submit any official record of the same to the deputy director of education.   has also listed six parameters (see box) which students have to fulfil while changing the college.
 
 A circular signed by  , deputy director of education, stated, “The conditions laid down by the education office will have to be met by students while changing colleges. The students must ensure that their reason for changing the college is just.” 
 
 Temkar said, in many cases, students tend to change the college because they are unhappy with the allotment during the FYJC CAP round. “When they change the college, the college authorities have an additional student on record, but it is not known to the education directorate. Hence, we have made it mandatory for colleges to carry out admissions online so that the education office has every admission on record,” Temkar added.
 
 The online system ensures that admissions are not done illegally through donations or other means. 
 
 Education activist Matin Mujawar said, “Parents who pay donations and take admissions illegally have been at a loss after the online system began. While they take admission through CAP rounds for Std XI, they use illegal means to get the college changed for Std XII. In fact, since the online system began, there was a trend of these particular class of students who would take admissions in colleges that were not much in demand and later get the college changed for Std XII.”
