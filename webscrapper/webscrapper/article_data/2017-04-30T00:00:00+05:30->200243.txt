-I’m out for dinner with friends but keep checking my phone every time it beeps.
-I’m sharing a cab with someone and speaking on the phone at the top of my voice thinking it’s my private car.
 -I don’t bother about the time as I ping a Whatsapp group chat at 3 am.
 -I park my car in the middle of the road to pick up my kid, causing traffic chaos.
 -I keep taking calls and checking messages in theatre halls distracting people around me.
 -I disagree with someone’s view on social media and won’t stop till I’ve had the last word, even if the discussion turns nasty... 
  
 Our lives have become all about ‘I’, ‘ME’ and ‘MYSELF’ and we are quite proud to flaunt our ‘I’ matter, ‘YOU’ don’t’ attitude. Several global surveys have concluded that social media has turned us into a rude, ill-tempered lot, with no boundaries of etiquette, decorum or decency. 
 
 A 2013 survey by Vital Smarts found that as social media usage surged over the years, it has given rise to increasing cases of incivility; with 78 per cent of 2,698 people reporting an increase in rudeness online. The study concluded that people have no qualms about being less polite virtually than in person. 
 
 Monica Mehra, 17, a student, says, “I guess this major disconnect among human beings has become easier because most of our communications are with an inanimate object, like a phone or computer screen. There are no real attachments anymore,” she says. 
 
 With time, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to blindside our fallacies and let ourselves walk scot free just because we have social media to blame. Let’s not forget, it’s also trendy to be a jerk. 
 
 Think reality shows like Roadies or Bigg Boss. A participant or a judge’s degrading behaviour is directly proportional to the number of TRPs the programme will fetch. We even justify this form of entertainment as a bit of vicarious pleasure. Except, it’s not a bit, is it? It’s permeated our lives on a daily basis, and we aren’t apologetic about being rude anymore. It’s not the news of war, poverty, mass murders, political turmoil, that garners our attention. We want to see who’s being trolled! Appalling behaviour and intolerant views, with a good dose of expletives thrown in, have become fodder for the soul. 
 
 We are texting more and talking less. People form perceptions about each other without much personal interaction. The culture of instant gratification — instant food, instant messaging, instant opinions — has resulted in instant reactions, no matter how rude.
 
 Businessman, blogger, Harish Shetty, 34, believes we are a generation with a massive sense of entitlement. “People are actually happy they don’t have to make the pretence of being polite anymore. Everyone’s running at a break-neck speed to outdo each other, and in the process, they have lost all ounces of civility – the benchmark of a civilised society. No one wants to slow down, introspect, that too for the sole purpose of being civil.” 
 
 Lynne Truss’ book, Talk to the Hand – The Utter Bloody Rudeness of Everyday Life (or six good reasons to stay at home and bolt the door), gives an insight about the breakdown in the distinction between private and public codes of behaviour. There was a time when we knew the difference. We knew how to disagree and still be polite. But it’s all changed now. 
 
 Actor Raima Sen says, "We have redefined the meaning of politeness as barely tolerating another person. It’s not an inherent trait to be civil anymore; it takes a gigantic effort. Rudeness comes naturally to us."
 
 Says Rita Gangwani, personality and business expert, “Look at how words like ‘please’, ‘thank you’, have gone missing from our vocabulary. Our language is casual. Everyday transactions have become just that – transactions, without courtesies. The worst part is people don’t even realise how discourteous they have become.”
 
 A Harvard Business Review experiment on rudeness came out with some interesting conclusions. Participants who were treated rudely by others were 30% less creative and produced 25% fewer ideas (and their ideas were less original) than the ones who weren’t treated rudely. Rude behaviour is not just an epidemic but it’s contagious. Unless, we find a way to reward good behaviour and call out bad behaviour, we are headed for disaster.
 
 
 
 Daily Twitter battles triggered over something religious like in the case of singers   and   being trolled; an MP thwacking an airline official with a shoe and refusing to apologise; a presidential campaign fought bitterly with personal attacks, or alleged racist comments by a tech CEO that got him trolled – rudeness is a way of life now. We witness it every day and are normalising to the point of validating such behaviour.
