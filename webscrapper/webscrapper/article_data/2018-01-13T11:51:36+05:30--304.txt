AURANGABAD: The   police late on Thursday night booked   corporator   on the charges of outraging the modesty of a 39-year woman.

 Kulkarni, a resident of Shivdutt Housing Society, N-8, Cidco, rejected the allegations as false and baseless. "In fact, the woman was trying to befriend me. She lodged a complaint after I rejected her friendship offer," he told   on Friday.
 
 The corporator also claimed that at least a couple of hours before the woman lodged the complaint, he had submitted a letter to police, informing them about the issue.
 
 Police inspector   said, "We had sent a team to nab the suspect but we are unable to trace him."
 
 Kulkarni had been booked in a similar case earlier. The Cidco police had charged him with molesting a 12-year-old girl on December 15, 2011. The girl, along with her younger brother, was at home when the suspect gained entry and tried to molest her, the chargesheet had said.
