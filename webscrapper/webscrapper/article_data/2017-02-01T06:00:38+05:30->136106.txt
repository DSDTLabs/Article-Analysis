AHMEDABAD: An anti-corruption protest in the new west zone office of the   (AMC) in Bodakdev went awry when a group of activists tried to force-feed a civic official currency notes dipped in pickle. 

 The incident took place at the Bodakdev civic centre of the AMC where a group of traders and activists started protesting against one AMC officer for allegedly demanding bribes to settle issues pertaining to non-payment of past property tax instalments.
 
 The group of activists, who called themselves members of ‘Lokrakshak Seva Samiti’, was led by   and 35 others. They had gheraoed an assistant manager   on Tuesday morning. 
 
 The protesters allegedly told the officer that they had carried out a “sting operation”. When the official asked for proof, the crowd got angry and tried to force feed Vyas banknotes dipped in pickle. 
 
 “An FIR has been lodged with the Vastrapur police in this case. If the activists had problems, they should have provided me or the zonal deputy commissioner the proof, whatever document or evidences they may have. I would have ensured action. This is not the way,” said municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar. 
 
 Vastrapur police inspector B J Sarvaiya told TOI, “We have detained 35 people and arrested Bhatt for unlawful assembly, rioting, obstructing a government officer to perform his duty and assaulting a government official,” Sarvaiya said.
