Vadodara: High drama was witnessed outside municipal commissioner Dr Vinod Rao’s house on Thursday morning a woman bitten by a stray dog created ruckus there. 

 A woman identified as Payal Damodardas was bitten by a stray dog near the water tank when she was walking in the Sayajibaug. She lost her temper and straight went to Rao’s house to register a complaint. But the guards outside Rao’s house didn’t allow her which resulted in a heated argument. 
 
 Interestingly, bringing pets in Sayajibaug is banned but stray dogs roam around freely inside. 
 
 When asked about the incident, VMC’s parks and gardens director (in-charge) Bhupendra Sheth dismissed it and said that VMC can’t do anything about the stray dogs roaming inside Sayajibaug.
 
 “The woman and some other walkers gathered near municipal commissioner’s house and the police too was called in. She was admanant on registering complaint about negligence. There were heated arguments for sometime and later she left with the cops,” one of the security guards posted inside Sayajibaug said.
 
 Payal went to Sayajigunj police station but she didn’t register FIR till Thursday evening. 
 
 The police said that she went for treatment and told them that that she would return to file a formal complaint. 
 
 “What can we do if stray dogs loiter in Sayajibaug? There are lot of stray dogs in the city. How can we stop them from entering the park? VMC doesn’t have any idea of how to tackle the issue. If you have any suggestion do tell us,” said Sheth who seemed indifferent about the episode. The dog bite, however, became a cause of concern among hundreds of citizens who come to the garden every day. 
 
 Dozens of stray dogs are seen loitering inside the park daily and walkers witness vicious dog fights as well. Some of the morning walkers also feed the stray dogs and monkeys in the park.
