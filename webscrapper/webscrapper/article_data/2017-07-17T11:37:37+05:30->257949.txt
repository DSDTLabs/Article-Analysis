The much-awaited   premiered on Sunday night, marking the TV debut of   as host and, of course, ending a longstanding suspense over the identity of the 14 celebrity contestants.

 While Jr NTR’s acting prowess has long been established, his foray into television opened a door for the actor to show fans and admirers a whole new side to him and connect with a wider audience.
 
 As the show debuted yesterday, comparisons were drawn between Jr NTR and his Bollywood counterpart, Salman Khan, who hosts the Hindi version of Bigg Boss. The Tollywood superstar, impeccably dressed for the occasion, set the stage on fire with his dance moves. Netizens were divided in their opinion of NTR’s efficiency as a host. While many people applauded his non-rigid body language and charisma, others were disappointed that he didn’t spring any surprises or do anything different from what he’s known for.
 
 The whole point of people looking forward to the star hosting the show was to see a more personal side to him. But, no matter how effortless and effective Jr NTR was as host, he did not allow the audience a peek into a persona that could have been an amalgamation of all or some of the characters he has played on the big screen.
 
 The only time Tarak seemed to do that was when he saw the swimming pool at the   house — he was excited as a child, but that was just a fleeting moment. He immediately reverted to the character he was playing at that point — that of a host.
 
 Is it too soon to judge the Young Tiger? Let’s give him a week or two more to rock and roar.
