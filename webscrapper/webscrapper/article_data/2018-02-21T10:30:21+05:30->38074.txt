CHANDIGARH: The long wait for a policy to streamline the street-vending business has aggravated the problem of encroachment in major parts of the city. 

 The resident welfare associations claim to have written to the municipal corporation time and again about the need to keep a check on the encroachment upon marketplaces. The excuse the   officials give for not keeping a check on encroachment is that they are in the process of framing a policy. Until then, they say they can't take any serious action against the land grabbers.
 
 During a recent meeting of the   of Chandigarh ( ), various representatives had highlighted that illegal vendors in the markets had increased manifold in the past four years when the MC had been busy framing a policy for regulating their business. 
 
 The members of Foswac alleged that they had raised the issue with the officials concerned and identified the areas where encroachment had increased, "but there was no official action against the rampant land grab".
 
 Foswac chairman   said the MC had failed to implement the Vendor's Act, and so cause a loss to the tune of crores of rupees to the corporation, besides a big inconvenience to most of the residents when they visit Chandigarh's markets, where they find their footpaths, corridors, and walking areas occupied. 
 
 He said the matter should be investigated at the highest level to hold someone accountable for not implementing the Vendors' Act. The delay in the earmarking of vendor zones in various sectors has caused revenue loss of crores of rupees to the municipal corporation. 
 
 The RWAs are also fed up with the attitude of the authorities concerned against rampant encroachment in the city even after many representations pointing out the same. Foswac plans to take another representation to the civic authorities about the need to keep a periodic check on encroachment that builds up with time.
