PUDUCHERRY: Under fire for the spurt in incidence of murders in the last two months, Puducherry   promised to weed out ‘a few black sheep’ in the   for having nexus with   in an effort to maintain law and order in the Union territory.

 Narayanasamy told reporters on Monday, that a policeman, who gave a mobile phone to a life convict lodged in prison and another policeman, who had links with gambling gangs have been terminated from service. He warned of stringent action against policemen having links with rowdy elements. However he refused to elaborate the reasons for the suspension of superintendent of police (rural) V Deivasigamani. The SP, who will retire in a few months, was suspended for tardy investigation of the murder of contractor and scrap dealer. The case was later transferred to CB-CID.
 
 “Our prime aim is to eliminate rowdy elements from the territory,” said Narayanasamy while maintaining that the motives of the recent murders were due to previous enmity, business rivalry and family disputes.
 
 He said police swung into action following recent murders and arrested those involved and lodged them in prison. He said the government strengthened the vigil and directed the intelligence wing to prevent heinous crimes in the territory.
 
 Underscoring the significance of maintaining law and order in a tourist town like Puducherry, Narayanasamy said police have been directed to ensure adequate protection for the visiting tourists and residents of the territory. He maintained that the government has given a free hand to police to act without any fear or favour and said police were free to use their weapons within rules.
 
 He also said Puducherry was the seventh state/Union territory to pass the GST Bill and expressed optimism on the smooth transition to the new taxation regime with effect from July 1.
