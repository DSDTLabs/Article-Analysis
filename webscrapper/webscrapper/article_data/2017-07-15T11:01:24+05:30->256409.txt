SURAT: Hitesh Sanklecha, the textile trader who is on a   for the past 14 days against Goods and   (GST), was taken to New Civil Hospital (NCH) for a medical check-up here on Friday. 

 Sanklecha alleged that police literally kept him under house arrest at the hospital for the entire day despite no cause of concern in his medical reports. The police also forced him to break his indefinite strike by offering him food, but he refused to take it. 
 
 “I was on dharna at   as per my daily routine. The 108 ambulance came to the spot and the doctors asked me to accompany them for a medical check-up. I refused to go, but they insisted,” Sanklecha said. 
 
 “I went to the hospital and underwent the medical tests. The medical reports did not show any health issue and I am perfect. Still, the police insisted that I should break the hunger strike and offered me food and fruits” added Sanklecha. 
 
 Sanklecha said there was a political conspiracy to break the textile traders’ agitation. There are some vested interests who do not want him to continue the agitation. 
 
 “The moment I was escorted into the 108 ambulance by the police, tension started brewing on the roads. I heard people blocking traffic for more than five hours” Sanklecha added. 
 
 Sanklecha was allowed to go home in the night. 
 
 Sanklecha’s supporter,  , said, “Hitesh is doing well. Police want him to break the hunger strike, but Hitesh is firm on his stand. Hitesh will continue his hunger strike as he has made a promise to the traders’ community that he will not end his protest until the government accepts their demands.”
