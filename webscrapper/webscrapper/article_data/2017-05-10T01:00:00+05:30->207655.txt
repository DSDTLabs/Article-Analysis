Actress   is being rumoured to play the female lead in the   film. But this has also led to her being trolled by online media and TV channels for allegedly choosing a Tamil film over a Kannada one. There were statements attributed to the youngster that read that her career was more important than Kannnada films. 

 After being trolled online,   chose to take to her Facebook page to write, “Kannada is my mother tongue and I respect it immensely, my first preference is always Kannada. Before judging please know the truth and understand the situation. Everything you see and listen about on TV isn’t true, And I didn’t give any offensive statements. My language is my love. I don’t need anyone to explain it to me. (sic)”
 
 When we contacted Samyuktha about the alleged   Subbaraj-Prabhudheva film, she said, “There is nothing to talk about. I ain’t doing it.”
