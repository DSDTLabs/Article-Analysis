After playing Rani Sajja Bai Solankini in the historical show 'Bharat Ka Veer Putra - Maharana Pratap', actress   is now set to foray into the mythological genre. She will soon join the cast of the show ' ' as Daruka Devi. Divyaalakshmi has actually replaced Sneha Namandi on the show, who had to quit due to date issues and apparently wanted to take up other projects.

 Divyaalakshmi confirms, "Yes, that's true. Some flashback scenes were shot with the previous actress and I am shooting them again."
 
 Talking about her role, she tells us, "My role is written very beautifully. It's an emotional and positive character. She is a devotee of Parvati, who later becomes a goddess by her blessings. I am in awe of the look; it's so artistic. It takes three hours to get ready, especially because of the body art. I love experimenting with my looks and I am glad that my look in this show is quite different from my previous outings."
 
 Just like her character, the actress is also a Mahakaali devotee in real life. She says, "I visit the Kali Mata temple close to my house regularly. During my childhood, I used to dance during Durga Pooja and I can recite Durga Chalisa because I am reading it since childhood. Besides that, I love Mahakaali because she is the Goddess of justice."
