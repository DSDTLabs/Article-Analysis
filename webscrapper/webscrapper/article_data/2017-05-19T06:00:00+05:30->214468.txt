Jalpaiguri: Within a month of two rhinos being killed in   national park for their horns, poachers were again spotted at the park on Thursday. There was an exchange of gunfire between security personnel and the poachers at Dhupjhora area of the forest. 

 Although the forest department remains tight-lipped about the incident, according to sources, a regular patrolling party of forest guards and SSB jawans spotted at least three armed poachers at the park in the afternoon. 
 
 On being confronted, the poachers reportedly fired at the patrolling party. The forest guards and the SSB jawans immediately took cover behind trees and retaliated. But taking the advantage of the dense foliage, the poachers managed to escape into the jungle. 
 
 Soon, a big team of SSB jawans and police personnel from Nagrakata and Metialli were sent to Gorumara and all possible exits were sealed. A thorough combing operation has been started and according to reports available, one of the poachers has been nabbed. Search is on to get hold of the other two poachers. 
 
 Sumita Ghatak, conservator of forests, wildlife, northern circle, denied there was any gunfight with poachers. She admitted an unnatural sound resembling that of a bullet being fired was heard from the forest. 
 
 “We have arrested a man. He has revealed two other names to us. We will get them as well,” she said. She confirmed a combing operation was on in the forest. “The CISF will join us on Friday,” Ghatak added. 
 
 Gorumara is one of only five forest tracts in India where the one-horned rhinos can be found in the wild. The others are Assam’s Kaziranga, Orang and Manas national parks and Bengal’s Jaldapara National Park. Rhinos can also be seen in the Terai region of Nepal. 
 
 There are about 3,000 Indian rhinos in the wild, half of them in Kaziranga alone. Gorumara has around 53 rhinos and attracts thousands of tourists every year.
