DHARAMSHALA: Highlighting the issue of setting up the   (CUHP), former BJP minister   on Sunday said that the   regime has failed to keep its promises made in the last assembly elections.

 Speaking to the media while launching a cleanliness drive in the town on the birthday of Prime Minister  , the former Dharamshala legislator alleged that the Congress promised to set up the CUHP campus in Dharamshala but failed.
 
 Taking a hit at the state government, and the local legislator and urban development minister Sudhir Sharma, he said that people will seek answers from the government, and the local MLA and minister as to what happened to the promise.
 
 He further alleged that the Congress has always played politics over the CUHP campus. Despite this, it is not clear if the campus will come up at Dharamshala or any other place.
 
 “Chief minister Virbhadra Singh, too, has been deceiving people by giving contradictory statement on the issue,” Kapoor alleged.
 
 “The Congress is to be blamed if the CUHP is still awaiting its permanent campus,” he added.
 
 Set up in 2010, the CUHP still runs from two temporary academic blocks, one at Shahpur and other in Dharamshala.
 
 The ex-minister also took a dig at the Congress government over the proposed inter-state bus terminal at Dharamshala and said he hopes that the project does not meet the fate of Mcleodganj bus terminal.
 
 “Mcleodganj bus terminal, envisaged in 2004, hit legal hurdle due to the irregularities committed by then Congress government and matter is still pending in the court,” he alleged
