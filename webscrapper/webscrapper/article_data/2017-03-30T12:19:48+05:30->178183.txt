MEERUT: Nearly a month after Union HRD ministry said that   are a   and instructed to make a list of students who are in possession of an   card, statistics reveal that only 34% of the total mid-day meal beneficiary students have Aadhaar cards in place. Out of the total 1.73 lakh students in 1,561 schools of the district, only 58,820 students have Aadhaar cards. The basic education department is now planning to set up Aadhaar card camps to fill the gap.
 
  Meerut basic shiksha adhikari   said, “We got the list of the students who have Aadhaar cards by sending out notices to the block education officers. The statistics have revealed that only 34% students have Aadhaar cards. We are planning to hold Aadhaar camps in all schools.”
  
  This has come at a time when the   told the Centre that it cannot make the Aadhaar card mandatory to extend the benefits of its welfare schemes. The Supreme Court further added that the government, however, cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar in other schemes like opening of bank accounts.
  
  “Now that the Supreme Court’s decision has come, we don’t have a clear idea on whether making Aadhaar cards of these students is mandatory or not. We are waiting for the instructions, but until then, we have to go by the previous orders. Therefore, we are planning for Aadhaar card camps as soon as the schools reopen,” said Iqbal.
  
  The department provides mid-day meals to as many as 1.73 lakh students in 1,561 schools of the district.
  
  Meanwhile, authorities say that though they plan to hold Aadhaar camps, the process gets difficult as the private agencies insist on having at least 100 students in each camp. “It is very difficult to transport students from nearby schools to one spot. In the past, such camps have not concluded with a positive result,” said Iqbal.
