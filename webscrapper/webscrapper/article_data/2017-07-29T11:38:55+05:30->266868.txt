CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh District Consumer Disputes   has directed a Manimajra-based clothing store, Aero Club, to refund Rs 416.55 and pay Rs 2,000 as compensation to a Sector 15 resident for charging VAT on discounted products wrongly.

 Apart from the refund compensation, the outlet has been asked to pay Rs 1,000 as litigation cost, taking the total amount it has been asked to cough up to Rs 3,416. 
 
 In his complaint, Sector 15 resident   had said the store was offering promotional discounts ranging from 40% to 70% when he had visited it on November 13, 2016. He claimed that he made purchases of Rs.4,554.45, inclusive of all taxes, but the store issued a retail invoice for an amount of Rs.4,971.
 
 When he saw the invoice, he noticed that the store had charged Rs 416.55 as VAT. Though Goel asked the cashier to waive the same as the MRP was inclusive of all taxes, the cashier refused. Left with no option, Goel paid the billed amount, he said before the forum.
 
 In its reply, the outlet said the complainant had misunderstood the meaning of MRP and how VAT was levied. It said Goel made the purchases during a clearance sale, where VAT had to be paid on the MRP.
 
 The outlet said it had not charged tax twice. Pleading there is no deficiency in service or unfair trade practice, the outlet prayed for dismissal of the complaint.
 
 After going through the records, the forum said, “From a perusal of the record, it becomes evident that the complainant did purchase three products having different MRPs. Further, it is evident from the invoice that after giving discount on the said products, the total amount payable came to Rs.4,554.45 only, but the outlet, illegally, charged an amount of Rs.4,971 by adding Rs.416.55 as VAT.
 
  The outlet has failed to substantiate its act either through some government notification or case law. When MRP included all taxes,   on the discounted price would amount to indulging in unfair trade practice on the part of the outlet.”
