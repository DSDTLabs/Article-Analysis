PANAJI: Forest officials rescued a two-year-old male   weighing in at 30kg from a garage of an unoccupied house in   on Friday as more than 3,000 people watched from a distance.

 The leopard is suspected to have strayed from a nearby hill on Thursday night looking for food. He took refuge in the garage. The animal rescue squad of the   range forest received an alert at 1.15pm on Friday after a local spotted it.
 
 “Post inspection we learnt that the leopard was resting beneath a vehicle in the garage,” said range forest officer Siddhesh Gaude. After laying a trap, forest officials made attempts to lure the leopard out but in vain. “Around 3,000-4,000 people gathered outside the house making it difficult for us to lure the mammal out. We then approached the   police to disperse the crowd,” said Gaude.
 
 Local resident Omkar Pawaskar said, “Police personnel fenced the area following which there was some crowd control.” At 4.30pm, the squad tranquilized the leopard with a blowpipe leaving the animal temporarily unconscious.
 
 “After 20 minutes, we captured it and sent it to Bondla wildlife sanctuary for examination,” said Gaude.
