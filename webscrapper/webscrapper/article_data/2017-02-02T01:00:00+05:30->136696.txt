A new nail trend? Haven’t we had enough with the pompom nails, the fur nails, succulent   and all the ridiculous stuff   taught us to put on our nails? However, this one’s pretty, minimalistic and perfect for those who prefer understated glam. The wirenail   is blowing up and we are all for it.

 You may have never thought that your DIY treasure of wires and clippers would someday come in handy for your manicure too! The brainchild of Korean nail artist  , (you might remember her for the shattered glass nail art trend) this might just seem crazy at first. C’mon, cuticles and sharp wire ends do not really gel. But once you are wired in, it’s gorgeous. 
 
 One can interpret the trend to suit their fashion aesthetics. From minimalistic to abstract patterns, copper wire’s malleability allows one to experiment! And for those who struggle to grow nails beyond fingertips, wires can give faux-length too!
