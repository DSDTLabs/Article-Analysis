Mrigank Dubey’s directorial debut, the   'Adhure Poore Se Hum', delves into how relationships mature and evolve over a period of time. Starring   and Pawan Shankar, the story revolves around two friends embarking on a long drive, leaving their bustling city lives behind. On the way, they reveal to each other, their hidden past. It breaks the rose-tinted nostalgia as they come face to face with their imperfect lives. The short film, which has won several awards at international festivals, will be screened at   soon. 

 Speaking about his debut film, Mrigank said, “Some people stay together and don’t love each other, while some don’t stay together and yet love each other. The story of my film explores this thought and also shows how relationships mature and evolve over time. People who love you will accept you the way you are, despite the emotional baggage or the secrets you may keep. The film looks at the changing definition of love and what it means in today’s times.”
