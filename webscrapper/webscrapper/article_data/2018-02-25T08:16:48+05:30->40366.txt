JAIPUR: Social activist   has attacked Prime Minister   for failing to stop scams, including the biggest banking scam of PNB involving Nirav Modi, in Jaipur on Saturday.

 Anna said that despite Modi’s tall promises of not allowing corruption, scams are happening in the country. “Unless a powerful Lokpal will be in place, such instances will continue to surface,” he said.
 
 He accused Modi and Delhi CM   of not providing any relief to the people due to the lack of vision. “Both are obstructing the development of India and they can never lead to holistic development of the country,” said Anna.
 
 He said that Modi government is anti-farmer which is evident from his policies. “Modi government is pro-industrialists. Neither they are giving minimum support price to the farmers nor they are giving implementing reforms for the same,” said Hazare.
 
 He claimed to have a final battle over the Jan Lokpal law in Delhi on March 23. “A meeting was called on March 1 to plan the strategy. Both   and   has damaged the lokpal. Modi government should recall the Lokpal bill. This is cheating,” he added.
