 According to the report, which is based on feedback taken from over 1,860 business heads and HR leaders, about 76% of organisations expect to have an increased recruitment volume this year compared to about 65% last year.
 
 The report said nearly 86% of the senior business leaders from top 5 sectors — including  ,  ,  ,   and   — feel   will remain a pertinent challenge for them in 2018. 
 
 The report specifically mentioned how banking (100%) and IT (87%) sectors were moving away from meeting the basic needs to addressing different priorities. The report said these sectors felt they required a highly skilled and stable talent pool. 
 
 Mettl said companies will use social media the most for recruiting (about 36%) candidates this year, followed by other channels such as external recruiting/job fairs, campus recruitments (about 24%) and talent sourcing firms (about 19%).
 
 Ketan Kapoor, CEO and Co-founder, Mettl said, “Organisations, today, are moving away from the basic requirement of hiring people to focusing on different needs and priorities. In view of the current hiring trends across India, it was an obvious choice for us to come up with a research report addressing various issues in an incredibly competitive talent acquisition environment.”
 
 Given the rising rates of unemployment and growing demand for skilled workforce across sectors, the report highlights the need for organisations to develop a blended approach to talent management and recruitment.
 
 The report also indicates a sharp increase in the budgetary allotments by companies towards hiring the right candidates. 
 
 At the same time, it also said candidates will look to work for organisations that offer flexible working arrangements and congenial work cultures.
