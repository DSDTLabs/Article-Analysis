DHARAMSHALA: The past nine days have been the most difficult for the Singh family of Lunj village in Kangra district. The traumatized family has been waiting for the body of Onkar Singh (42), who died of cardiac arrest on February 23 in Saudi Arabia. Delay in completion of paper work and procedures has left the family worried and angry. 

 Onkar had been working in a private company in Riyadh for the last 10 years. He was a mechanic in a company that deals in transportation. His wife   (36) came to know of the death in Riyadh on February 24, when Onkar’s brother   called to inform them about the tragedy. 
 
 “When Shamsher failed in his efforts to bring the body back, he informed the family about the death. We were told that he died due to cardiac arrest on February 23,” said Anil, the deceased’s younger brother.
 
 The family has approached their local MLA and sitting cabinet minister   for help. When contacted, Choudhary said they have already contacted the Union ministry and “are hoping that the body will reach in a day or two”.
 
 Village pradhan   said, “This delay is painful, the deceased’s brother is already there but even he is finding it tough to complete all the formalities.” 
 
 Onkar’s visa was to expire in March end and the family was awaiting his return. He leaves behind a wife and two daughters — Siya (11) and Sachana (2).
