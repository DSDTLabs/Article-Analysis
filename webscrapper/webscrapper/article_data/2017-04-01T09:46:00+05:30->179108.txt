VASCO:   on Friday arrested Daji ‘Krishna’ Salkar and 18 others, including his wife Shami Salkar, for ‘trespassing’ into the cabin of   chief officer Deepali Naik and threatening and abusing her, a week ago. 

 All the accused were released on bail, later on Friday evening. 
 
 Naik had lodged a complaint with Vasco police against 19 persons who abused her in her own office. After having completed the necessary investigations, Vasci police, at about 11am on Friday, summoned Salkar to come to the police station with the other accused who were part of the group that allegedly barged into Naik’s office. 
 
 They accused were then taken to Goa medical college and hospital for a medical test. Here, the accused resisted arrest.
 
 It took an hour for the police to convince them of the arrest procedures. Sources said the accused were heard shouting slogans against BJP local politicians for injustice and ‘gundaraj’. 
 
 The lawyer representing the accused procured a bail order from Vasco JMFC on the conditions of verifying their address, surety of Rs 10,000 each, and a promise to not leave the country while investigations are on. 
 
 “We had only gone to meet Naik to ask her to stop dancing to the tunes of local MLA (Carlos Almeida). She was only trageting my supporters who backed me during assembly elections which is wrong,” Salkar said. 
 
 Salkar added that he would be writing to chief minister   to transfer Naik immediately.
