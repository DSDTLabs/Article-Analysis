CHENNAI: Cutting down on 50% of portions on science subjects may mean losing out on fundamentals concepts and knowledge levels for   students, say a section of city schools which worry the decision may not be the best way forward when it comes to select subjects. The HRD ministry may have decided to reduce the NCERT syllabus by half but some schools fear it may do more harm than good, especially when it comes to maths and science. 

 With the board seeking feedback from the stakeholders on the decision, schools shared their concerns. 
 
 Teachers mentioned that the syllabus was last reviewed in 2005 and sudden reduction in portions may not be easy for students to adapt to and expressed that knowledge levels could take a hit. 
 
 “With respect to some areas like languages or social sciences, cutting down makes sense as it can be made more relevant to the current context. But cutting down on science and maths may mean losing out a lot of fundamental concepts. Principals from different city schools are planning to meet to put forth suggestions together as well,” said  , Advisor to  .
 
 “The process of transitioning from school, where basics are taught, to higher studies where advanced levels of the same basics are involved needs to be an easy one for students,” said  , teacher of a CBSE school in the city.
 
 Some felt social sciences could be cut down easily as it involves four parts of history, geography, civics and economics that could be concise. However, a few teachers also felt it could be upgraded in the process. 
 
 The decision to reduce portions was aimed at ensuring students get time for other activities.
