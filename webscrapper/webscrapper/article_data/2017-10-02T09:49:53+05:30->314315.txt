VASCO: Germany touched down in Goa in the wee hours of Sunday to begin their quest of winning the Fifa U-17 World Cup title for the first time ever.

 The team arrived at the Dabolim airport, Vasco, around 3.30am without star striker and captain   who was scheduled to arrive on Monday owing to his commitments with his club   in the Bundesliga.
 
 Arp, who recorded two hattricks in the U-17 Euro championships in Croatia earlier this year, created another record on Saturday by becoming the first player born after 2000 to play in the Bundesliga.
 
 Head coach   was upbeat on the campaign in India. "We are happy to be here and we cannot wait for the competition to start," he said.
