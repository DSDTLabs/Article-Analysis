New Delhi: An   Airbus A-320 new engine option (Neo) with 130 passengers on board had to return to Delhi soon after taking off for Bhubaneswar on Monday after the Pratt & Whitney (PW) engine of this aircraft developed a snag. This is the fifth reported snag in PW engines used by budget carriers IndiGo and GoAir on their brand new A-320 Neos in just over a month.

 “The IndiGo plane (VT-ITE) got an ‘engine oil chip detected’ message for engine number one soon after takeoff and had to return to Delhi,” said a senior official. Similar “engine oil chip” warning had come in three of the five problems reported in the PW engines of A-320 Neo in the last month.
 
 IndiGo did not comment on the latest engine trouble till the time of going to press. Given the frequency of snags in PW engines, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now made it mandatory for airlines to ground these planes immediately for repairs.
 
 “Earlier, airlines were allowed to fly an aircraft for 10 hours under minimum equipment list (MEL) after getting this warning on the PW engine of a Neo. This meant that they could attend to the problem within 10 hours of getting the warning. But on February 8, a GoAir A-320 Neo engine which got this warning developed the second issue in eight hours and then people in Dwarka (a township next to airport in Delhi) saw its engine on ‘fire’ after taking off from   Airport. After that we have removed the 10-hour MEL and made it mandatory to attend to this issue without any delay,” said a senior DGCA official.
 
 The A-320 is the most commonly used plane in India and dominates fleets of several big airlines here like IndiGo (all A-320 family),  , GoAir and Vistara.
 
 PW spokesperson Sara Banda had recently told TOI that Pratt & Whitney were supporting GoAir and IndiGo to assess the situation and minimise any disruption. “At this time, it is premature to speculate on the cause of the issues while they are still under review,” she added.
