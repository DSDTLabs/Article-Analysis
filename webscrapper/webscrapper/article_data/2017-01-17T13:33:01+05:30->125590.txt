 However, at the same time, infrastructure constraints are a major headache and there are traffic jam concerns when large number of vehicles enter the city during the festival. “We have 26 specially designated parking lots and if there is any traffic violation, strict action would be taken against them,“ he said.

 Authorities have taken auto rickshaw drivers in the district into confidence after introducing a special service ­ 'fest auto best auto' ­ with their cooperation, said the police. Auto rickshaws with the `fest auto best auto' stickers on it would come to the aid of the passengers who want to go from one venue to the other and this would make the transportation smoother compared to using private vehicles, said an officer.
