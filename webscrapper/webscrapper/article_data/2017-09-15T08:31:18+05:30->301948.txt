NEW DELHI: So far, there have been seven bilateral ODI series between the two teams on Indian soil with Australia winning four and the hosts three. Ahead of the five-match ODI series starting from September 17, here's a recap of those from 2009/10 to 2013/14.

 
 
 
 An ideal start to the series but not for India. Four Australian batsmen - Tim Paine, Ponting, Cameron White and Michael Hussey – hit fifties in the 1st ODI. A score of 292/8 wasn't formidable but regular blows meant it became one - until an unlikely stand between Harbhajan and Praveen Kumar brought the chase alive. But India still fell short of the target by five runs. The itch of finishing second in a close finish was wiped out with a big 99-run win in the 2nd ODI in Nagpur. Captain Dhoni scored 124 off 107 as India posted 354/7 in 50 overs. In reply, Australia were all out for 255 with only Mike Hussey (53) offering some resistance. And then on a testing Feroz Shah Kotla track, Yuvraj and Dhoni shared 148 runs for the fourth wicket as India chased down 230 with 10 balls to spare and take 2-1 lead. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 India then restricted Australia to 250 in the 4th ODI. Sehwag and Tendulkar led a sprightly start before Doug Bollinger (3/38) and allrounder Shane Watson (3/29) crashed their party. India innings lasted 46.4 overs and 226 runs. In Hyderabad, a big opening partnership followed by late fireworks from Cameron White propelled Australia to 350/4 on a batting-friendly track. Tendulkar kept fighting a lone battle and found some assistance from Raina (59). The capacity crowd went silent when The Master was caught for 175. India were bowled out for 347 and Australia took 3-2 lead. The 3-2 lead became 4-2 in Guwahati when India were skittled for 170 and Australia sealed the game with six wickets remaining. The scoreline remained the same as the final ODI was abandoned due to inclement weather. 
 
 
 
 
 It was a three-match series but two of them were abandoned due to wet outfield. In the only ODI which was possible, in Visakhapatnam, India recorded a five-wicket win and took the series 1-0. Australia were 205/3 in 45 overs and it looked they would manage a below par total after batting first. However, White had other plans as he went berserk in a whirlwind knock of 89* off 49 balls. Australia scored 84 runs from the final five overs of their innings, finishing with 289. The Indian openers failed but the middle order came to the rescue and at no. 3 future captain   scored a century with Yuvraj (58) and Raina (71*) dazzling in supporting roles. India chased down the target in 48.5 overs with five wickets remaining. 
 
 
 
 
 A high scoring affair that saw both the teams posting/successfully chasing/going past 300 runs regularly. Two matches in Ranchi and Cuttack produced no results due to inclement weather while the rest five, barring the opening game, were edge-of-the-seat contests. The series kicked-off in Pune where fifties from captain George Bailey (85) and opener Aaron Finch (72) took Australia to 304/8. Then their pacers combined to bowl out India for 232 with only Kohli scoring a half-century. In the second ODI, the top-five Australia batsmen scored fifties each in a mammoth total of 359/5 in Jaipur. India needed to hit the ground running and they did much better. Openers Rohit and Dhawan waded through the Australian attack with 176 runs in 26 overs. Dhawan fell five short of a century but Rohit logged his then best ODI total, an unbeaten 141 and with Kohli (100*), made a mockery of the target, hunting it down in 43.3 overs. 
 
  
 Mohali saw a nail-biting finish as   clobbered Ishant Sharma for four sixes and a four in the 48th over to help Australia chase down 304 in 49.3 overs. Dhoni's century took India to the comforts of a 300-plus total after Mitchell Johnson had reduced them to 76/4 at one stage. And the defence was going well before Faulkner's fireworks late in the chase. The action resumed in Nagpur after twin washouts. For the second time in the series, India hunted a 350 plus total again, which prompted Dhoni to say "better off to put a bowling machine." Bailey scored a big century – 156 and Watson 102 in total of 350/6. But India's top-three set-up a last-over finish with Kohli and Dhawan slamming centuries each and Rohit scoring 79. With the series tied at 2-2, Rohit chose the decider to better his previous highest ODI score with a maiden double-ton in the format – 209 off 158 as India scored 383/6. Australia gave a strong reply but even Faulkner's valiant 116 from no. 7 weren't enough as they were bowled out for 326 with India pocketing the series 3-2. Rohit was chosen as man-of-the-series.
