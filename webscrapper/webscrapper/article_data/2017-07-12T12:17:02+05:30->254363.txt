AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Tuesday extended the stay on surrender before jail authorities for the trustee of  ,  , in connection with a complaint filed by a parent alleging that the school duped parents by giving false assurance that it would fetch CBSE affiliation and thereby charging exorbitant fees.

 On a petition filed against cancellation of his bail by a sessions court, the high court granted time to Kapadia till August 14 and directed cops not to take any coercive step against him. On June 30, a sessions court at the Mirzapur rural court campus cancelled his bail and asked Kapadia to obtain relief from the high court within 15 days.
 
 While staying Kapadiaâ€™s arrest till August 14, the high court also issued notice to the state government and sought reply by the date when next hearing is scheduled. In his petition against cancellation of bail, Kapadia has submitted that there is no evidence of influencing witnesses. The offence is a compoundable one and a compromise has been reached between the school management and parents. Earlier, a magisterial court had granted bail to Kapadia. But the state government had challenged the court order before a sessions court, where it argued that Kapadia has tried to influence witnesses.
 
 Kapadia was booked for cheating after   filed a complaint with Ghatlodia police that the school charged huge fees on promise that it would ensure CBSE affiliation by the time the children are admitted in Class 1. But it did not happen.
