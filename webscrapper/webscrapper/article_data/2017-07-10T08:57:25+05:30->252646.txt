KANPUR: The 10th   for   of   is being held at IIT-K from July 8-15, in which 56 students from 16 institutes all over India are participating. 

 National Information Centre of Earthquake Engineering (NICEE) at IIT-K has been conducting workshops for UG students of architecture in earthquake resistant design practices from 2008.
 
 Lectures and hands-on studio sessions in tackling a design assignment will help students in internalizing earthquake-resistant practices as an integral part of their design decision making. 
 
 The selected participants were each sent a NICEE publication titled 'Architectural Teaching Resource Material on Earthquake Design Concepts'. 
 
 The inaugural function was chaired by Durgesh C. Rai of the host institute. He welcomed the participants and advised them to learn aspects of architecture related to structure design. 
 
 Architecture is rooted to engineering and engineering is rooted to science, but since architects are closer to public they have a very important role to play.
 
 He said that synergization of architects and structural engineers through this workshop is a healthy sign for the country and will also help in minimizing the disaster after earthquake. Another speaker Keya Mitra gave an insight of the workshop to the participants. 
 
 During the eight-day workshop, the students will be given an architectural design assignment, where they will be required to design an apartment complex containing a mix of various types of apartments, in addition to amenities and utilities for residents. 
 
 The studio sessions will be a mix of desk work and informal lectures, where individual cases will be used to illustrate earthquake engineering concepts. The design prepared by the participants will be evaluated on July 15.
