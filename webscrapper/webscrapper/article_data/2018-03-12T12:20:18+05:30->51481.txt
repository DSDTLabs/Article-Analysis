PANAJI:   vice-chancellor   appealed to the government to look beyond those with academic backgrounds and consider experienced people from the industry as professors to turn Goa into a knowledge hub. 

 He suggested the government consider new categories of assistant, associate and professors of practice where instead of insisting on NET, SET and PhDs, industry or craft experience be taken into consideration.
 
 There can be a proper selection process, he said, adding that they don’t need to be offered permanent jobs as they don’t require them. 
 
 “They should be recognized as teachers and examiners in the education system. Students would benefit tremendously from their experience,” he said, adding that this would provide quality education and attract students from around the country too. 
 
 He was speaking on the topic ‘Goa as a knowledge hub’ during a two-day national workshop on initiatives for quality enhancement in higher education in  . 
 
 The Goa University vice-chancellor also stressed the need for value education in mainstream education, irrespective of the branch of knowledge. This is a huge missing gap in the education system, he said.
