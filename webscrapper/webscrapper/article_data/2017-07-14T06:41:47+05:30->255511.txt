New Delhi: In a suspected case of road rage, two men and two women travelling in a Scorpio car were fired upon twice by two men in an i10 car outside the   police station in the wee hours of Thursday. 

 Shocked by the attack that took place around 1.30pm, the victims, who are cousins, didn’t approach the police immediately. Around 2am, they went to a police post near the Shangri La hotel and reported the matter. The police have recovered a   footage from the area that showed the accused fleeing in their i20. 
 
 The victims, residents of Pitampura, were returning from a birthday party at a restaurant in  . When they reached Baba Kharak Singh Marg, the accused drove towards them from the opposite direction and opened fire at them.
 
 As the bullets hit the Scorpio, the men fled towards Rajiv Chowk. The complainants told the police that the occupants of the i20 seemed to have aimed at the windshield of the Scorpio but the bullet missed it and hit the body of the vehicle. 
 
 The police suspect that the accused had fired at the car to teach the cousins a lesson. However, the youths denied having any argument with anybody. The police are questioning them to find out if they had a personal enmity or any family rivalry. 
 
 “We are trying to identify the miscreants. A case has already been registered,” said B K Singh, DCP, New Delhi. The case has been filed under Arms Act and IPC 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others). 
 
 Police sources said a CCTV footage recovered from a nearby Metro station showed the i20 car. The police are trying to scan its registration number. They have also kept the Scorpio as an evidence. Two empty 7.65mm cartridges have also been recovered from the spot.
