Bhopal: Stay happy in Rupee one a year. This is what the finance minister has allocated for the much publicized happiness department in the state. A sum of Rs 8.5 crore has been earmarked in 2018-19 for the happiness department, first of its kind in the country. 
 
 The sum is almost equal to the total population of MP, eight crore. 
  
 The amount of budget for happiness department has been increased since 2016 when the department was constituted, but is nothing when taken into account the state’s total budget size which is worth Rs 2, 04,642.44 crore. 
  
 Government’s argument is happiness cannot be measured or purchased in money. Budget for the happiness department was Rs 2 crore when the department was constituted in July 2016. It was increased to Rs 4.75 crore in 2017 while for 2018 allocation for the happiness department has been increased to Rs 8.50 crore. This is an increase of Rs 3.75 crore in comparison to previous budget. 
  
 The state government is also in the process to make happiness index to find out how happy the people are in MP. So apart from seeing that government is incurring yearly expenditure of Re 1 on them, the people in state would also know their happiness quotient this year, which also happens to be the election year. 
  
 On February 22 and 23, over 80 experts from different corners of world brainstormed in Bhopal to ascertain what makes people of Madhya Pradesh happy. The team included researchers, scientists and bureaucrats who have experience of the “administration” of happiness. 
  
 After the think-fest last week, the government decided to post happiness officers in every district. Every district would now have two officers and two employees. 
  
 MP made national headlines in July 2016 when it became the first state to set up a happiness department. In May last year, the state government signed an MoU with IIT-Kharagpur for the development of a happiness index to measure well-being of people in the state. The happiness index is expected to come by July, officials added.
