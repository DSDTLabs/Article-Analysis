 rapper ALL.OK has added a new feather to his cap as he has come out with a discography   series, remembering yesteryear’s Kannada actors. Prod him about what prompted him to come up with a tribute series like this, he says, “A lot of legendary   need to be felicitated through music and my discography tribute aims at doing so. I want these songs to play in pubs in the city and I want people to know these actors. It’s something special and the series will be about all those actors who made our childhood amazing.”

 The first video is about actor Narasimharaju, who was known for his comic timing in the Kannada film industry. Ask him about the series and he says, “Each video will have trivia about that particular actor along with great music. My first video is a tribute to Narasimharaju. It’s not a remix version. I want to pay tribute to several comic actors and villains, whom people have forgotten now. It will be entertaining and informative for the audience but through music.”
 
 Why have a tribute series like this, we ask? “I’ve never done anything with the intent of it going viral. I feel it’s about time that people experiment in the Kannada music industry. Very few people experiment in the digital market and I want to break that barrier. I want people to come up with new things in the Kannada digital market that will make people sit up and take notice. And through a series like this, people will know about legendary actors from the industry,” he says. What can the fans expect next in the series? “As of now, I’ve released only one track about Narasimharaju. I want to dedicate the entire series to a lot of Kannada actors. I want surprise people with these videos,” ALL.OK sums up.
