NEW DELHI: As a one-time exception to its order banning all vehicles older than 15 years from plying on  , the   (NGT) permitted the 21   to take place in the capital. 

 The rally is expected to be held from February 17-19. The three-day event will showcase 75 vintage and classic cars from India and 15 from abroad. Special maharaja cars and 25 bikes will also be displayed. 
 
 A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar gave permission for the seventh edition of the rally on a plea filed by Madan Mohan, founder trustee of the rally, which aims to raise funds for spastic children. The application had sought exemption from NGT’s November 26, 2014 order which had banned vehicles older than 15 years from plying on Delhi roads, thereby banning vintage cars as well.
 
 The theme of the rally is ‘motivation is what keeps you going’ and it will be flagged off from the Red Fort and culminate at Buddh International Circuit, Greater Noida, followed by a ceremonial drive.
