 TIMES VIEW
 
 A Bengaluru littered with festival waste and plagued by garbage contractors failing to pick up trash needs more than just an army of students and citizens sweeping the streets for a day. While the Swachh initiative on   took off well, and deserves to be lauded for raising civic awareness among the young, our civic administration desperately needs to set its house in order. At best, the city can be termed filthy, with residents failing to follow Swachh principles in their daily lives. Only when civic awareness filters down to each household can we hope to see change.
