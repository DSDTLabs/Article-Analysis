Colourful posters calling Deepa by nicknames reveal her growing popularity among the dissenters. In these posters, she is referred to as "Chinnathaai'', " '' and " ''. The poster put up in Pithalaipatti in Athoor union in Dindigul district, proclaims that she is "Chinnamma". It was printed by S Maran of Athoor.

On Saturday, AIADMK members including Kandasamy, Andisamy and Pandi, tried to put up a poster, inviting Deepa to take on the leadership of the party in Allinagaram in Theni district. Police arrived at the spot and threatened to arrest them if they put up the poster.
