AHMEDABAD: Several corporates have been spending a chunk of their profits on acts of social responsibility, especially since the Union government made such spending mandatory through the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Act. 

 Experts present at the   organized at   (AMA) on Saturday indicated that heritage is one of the arenas where corporates must divert funds as part of their CSR funding.
 
 Parag Desai, executive director,   Tea Group, emphasized on certain most neglected sectors in terms of CSR spending. He said, “One of the most neglected areas in CSR is heritage, art and culture. At a time when Ahmedabad has been conferred the coveted world heritage city status, the focus on heritage must increase. In fact, there is tremendous potential for corporates to increase their CSR funds in this area.”
 
 Desai further highlighted the scenario of CSR spending in the country. “With this, Gujarat ranks sixth across the country, ranking behind Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. This not just reflects the lack of spending but also the untapped potential when it comes to CSR spending,” he said.
 
 Experts present at the conference, also said that CSR spending should be more directional. Sharing more insights, Malay  , whole time director, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd, said, “Corporates spend lot of money on causes and so does government.”
 
 Mahadevia said, “Most stakeholders spend money across the same sectors. Issues such as environment, ecology, gender equality, sports, healthcare and education are often tapped upon by multiple stakeholders.Everyone is in the same space addressing bits of each of these issues. There is a need to be little more strategic and directional in the approach to spending.”
 
 He also proposed that corporates come together on a common platform to address social goals.
