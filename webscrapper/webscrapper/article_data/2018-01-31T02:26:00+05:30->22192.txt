Visakhapatnam: Ahead of the pre-monsoon cum cyclonic season, the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) in collaboration with Dredging Corporation of India ( ) has embarked on beach nourishment at the Visakhapatnam beach.

 Although, work is yet to begin as stakeholders are awaiting the arrival of the dredger from Haldia Port in West Benga, an 800 metre long floating pipeline has been laid at the sea from the outer harbour of the port to RK beach, near the Kursura Submarine museum. Once the dredger arrives, work is expected to begin in the next one or two days in February, said the deputy chairman of VPT PL Haranadh .
 
 Speaking to TOI, Haranadh said that the port has been undertaking beach nourishment since 1979 when the outer harbour was built. “Every year on an average we spend nearly Rs 10 crore for the nourishment work. This year, we are spending around Rs 16 crore to collect nearly 2.5 lakh cubic metres of sand from the outer harbour. The work would take nearly 30 days,” Haranadh added.
 
 Although VPT has been taking up beach nourishment on a regular basis, but for the last two years it has been undertaking this process on the recommendations of Deltares, a Netherlands-based independent institute that conducts research in water and subsurface. The VPT chairman is the head of a steering committee appointed by the state government to combat the sea erosion.
 
 According to experts, the transformation in beach morphology owing to reasons like construction of concrete buildings and setting up of industries along the coast have led to severe beach erosion in Visakhapatnam for the past three years.
