Thirteen-year-old Amulya   had her first solo art exhibition at the   last week. Sharing her experience, an ecstatic Amulya tells us, “It’s my first ever exhibition and I'm so happy because a lot of my paintings were sold on the first day itself.” A student of National Academy for Learning, Amulya began painting only two years back. “I used to colour when I was three years old and my dad always told me that I used to colour very neatly. My parents kept encouraging me and gave me more colouring books. As I grew up, I kept doing it and I began painting only in 2016,”says Amulya. Talking about her paintings, she says, “I don't follow any particular pattern or theme but I do a lot of still life paintings. I also have a keen interest in   paintings and tweak it according to my liking.”
How does she manage to strike a balance between her studies and painting? “When my classes are on, I usually finish all my homework on Friday itself, which then gives me time to paint on Saturdays and Sundays,” she says adding that she wants to continue her passion and be an artist when she grows up. “I want to do something related to art. My favourite painter is   and I want to follow his footsteps”
