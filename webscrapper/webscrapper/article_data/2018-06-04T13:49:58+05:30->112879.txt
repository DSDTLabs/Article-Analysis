Can you guess what   is up to these days? Her latest release ‘Uma’ is obviously gaining huge appreciation but she is also reportedly shooting high octane fight sequences for director Rajib’s upcoming film that also stars   and   in the lead.

 Most of these fight sequences are being shot outdoors, braving the extreme heat. However, the gorgeous actress believes that although the outdoor shoots are quite tiring, it’s also fun as, for her, these action stunts are just like a form of exercise. Sayantika is excited to work with a director like   who is very supportive. The Bengalee diva also revealed that she will be seen doing some serious fighting in this yet-to-be-titled movie. Rumour has it that the Rajib directorial is actually a remake of Nagarjuna’s Telugu super-hit ‘Mass’.
 
 In Srijit’s ‘Uma’, Sayantika plays the mother to little Uma and according to the actress, this film can become a turning point in her career just like ‘Awara’ did in 2012. The actress now reportedly wants to do roles that can strike the right chord among the audience.
