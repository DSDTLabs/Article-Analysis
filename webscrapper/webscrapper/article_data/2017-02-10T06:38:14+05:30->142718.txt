 For Mellisa Smith and Sachin Bandukwala, who worked on ‘Vacant Land in a Dense City,’ the open plots, now part of city’s declared ‘Green Zone’ preventing any construction activity, provided an opportunity to create community space with locally procured material such as bamboo, iron pipes, wires and ropes.
