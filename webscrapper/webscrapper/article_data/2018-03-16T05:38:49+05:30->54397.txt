 Developed indigenously, the 32-seater Tata Starbus hybrid-electric AC buses have been handed over to MMRDA after being registered at the local RTOs. 
 
 “The new design, CCTV cameras, wi-fi and more importantly, the hybrid-electric advanced technology is what makes the bus expensive,” said an MMRDA official.
