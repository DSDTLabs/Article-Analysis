NAGPUR: Condemning   state president Raosaheb Danve’s anti-farmer remark, writer and activist Aruna Sabhane and   (NU) professor Pramod Munghate organized an all-party ‘Nishedh Sabha’ at Samvidhan Square on Tuesday. 

 Munghate stressed the need to respect farmers and said that no politician has a right to use such offensive words. He further added, “Though Danve apologized, the BJP hasn’t taken any action against him.”
 
 Amitabh Pande, a farmer from Narkhed, said that farmers are not only verbally abused but also financially tortured. “The government had asked us to increase production and promised a good profit. But now they are neither buying nor lifting the ban on export.” 
 
 PM Modi recently said that the government would procure dal from an African country at a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs130 but when it came to farmers, the   is as low as Rs50, he said. 
 
 Farmer and activist Vijay Jawandhiya had written to Danve in 2014 and asked to impose import duty on edible oil and pulses. Danve had replied that he’ll put the issue forward. 
 
 “There’s 60% import duty on sugar and but there is only 10% import duty on pulses. The BJP is a rich man’s government, they fooled farmers by promising 50% profit and now they’re abusing them,” he added
 
 Activist Lila Chitale said that Gandhiji had once said that everyone would get food, shelter, clothing and voice. But today farmers are being forced to shut up.
