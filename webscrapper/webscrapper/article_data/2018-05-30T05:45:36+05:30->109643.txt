SYDNEY: A decision by Australia’s former deputy prime minister to sell his story about having a love child with a former aide sparked derision on Tuesday and calls for politicians to be banned from paid interviews.

 
 Scandal-hit Bar naby Joyce, who was forced to quit in February and move to the backbench over his affair with his 33-yearold former media adviser, will reportedly be paid Aus $150,000 (US $113,000) for a tell-all TV appearance by the pair on Sunday.
 
 Malcolm Turnbull said he planned to raise the matter privately with Joyce, whose smaller   rules alongside the PM’s Liberals. “It’s certainly not... a course of action that I would’ve encouraged him to take, I’ll put it that way,” he said.
 
 News that Joyce, 50, had left his wife of 24 years for   gripped   earlier this year, sparking debate about workplace culture. The saga took another twist when Joyce questioned the paternity of the baby boy, who has since been born.
 
 Best known outside Australia for threatening to euthanise Johnny Depp’s two dogs when they were brought into the country illegally, Joyce claimed that it was Campion’s decision to accept payment for the interview. He said they had tried to ride out the attention, but the paparazzi would not leave them alone.
