MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Tuesday informed the Bombay high court that there were 12,000-odd   registered in 2016 statewide, a drop by 500 over the previous year. 

 It also said the number of calls received on   helplines to help women in distress dropped by over 20% since 2015 to 5,181. 
 
 The state home department submitted the data in an affidavit filed in response to a PIL filed by the high court to understand what measures the state had taken for women’s safety. The PIL had come in the wake of a 2012 guilty verdict and death sentence by a trial court to a duo for a rape and murder of a call centre executive in Pune. 
 
 In December 2016, the HC had directed the state to detail its steps taken to ensure safety and security of office going women who travel at night after work.
 
 The Supreme Court had in 2012 laid down guidelines requiring states to direct police to ensure adequate safety measures for women, including increasing patrolling of plainclothes personnel. The HC wanted to know if the state had complied. 
 
 In its affidavit submitted by prosecutor F R Shaikh before a bench headed by Justice V M Kanade, the home department said that woman cops too are deputed in plainclothes for foot patrolling to prevent instances of sexual harassment at educational institutions, bus stands, cinemas, malls, parks, beaches, trains, places of worship, railway and Metro stations. Intensive patrolling is also on by special women-only squads called ‘Damini’ and ‘Nirbhaya Pathak’ and initiatives like ‘Police Didi’, where schoolchildren are taught about ‘inappropriate touch and talk’ has led to a drop in cases, it suggested.
 
 The state said 37 police stations conducted 5,975 awareness workshops in the last two years on crimes against women and safety measures. The women’s helpline numbers 103 in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai and 1091 in the rest of Maharashtra are toll-free.
