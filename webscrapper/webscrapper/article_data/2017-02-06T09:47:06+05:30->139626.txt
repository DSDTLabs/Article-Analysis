Do you *heart* someone but can’t put your feelings in words? Say it with  ...
Love ain’t easy. And expressing it? Even more so. Every now and then, we find ourselves struggling to find just the right words to profess our feelings to our paramour. We mean, love is more about blushes, winks, soft caresses and going googly eyes, right? 
 
 Time to ’fess up then. How many times did you take recourse to typing out the varied heart signs because saying ‘I Love You’ was just not sparkling enough? Yep, probably a million times. Now, let’s dig a little deeper. How about ‘I am sorry’? At such times, a *puppy face emoji* makes it so much easier than spelling it out. Top that up with some *flowers emoji*, *folded hands emoji* and *chocolates emoji* and you will be more than forgiven. 
 
 Speaking mush now has a whole lotta cute and that much-needed hint of mystery. We bet all you lovebirds have your little secret emoji codes that mean something completely different, and most probably NSFW (not safe for work, duh!), than it means to the rest of the world. Then there are   for the difficult-to-say-out-loud deeds. Toilet talk for instance. Nobody likes to say ‘I am pooping’ when the bae asks ‘Whatcha doin?’! At such a time, the poop emoji feels like a blessing. We agree, at delicate moments in your relationship, emojis come handy — ‘I am angry with you’ or ‘It was my fault’ or ‘Let’s make out.’ In fact, if   wrote the song about being dumped by   over the phone ('Forever And Always') today, it would probably be an emoji text, reading *couple emoji* *couple kissing emoji* *fast forward emoji* *sad boy emoji* *boy saying no with crossed hands emoji* *sad girl emoji* *broken heart emoji* and *boy running away emoji*.
 
 At this point, we would like to make it clear that we are not trying to put ideas into your mind. It’s Valentine’s Day in a week, and a break-up is farthest from our mind. We are already thinking of it not in terms of cards or flowers, but *heart eye emojis* *kiss emojis* *wine emojis* *beating heart emojis* *ring emojis* and *stars and moon emojis*. In fact, we are so in the mood for love right now, that we have kind of become incapable of talking straight and are increasingly going to talk in emojis with you guys. Hope the *double heart emoji* between us will only become stronger that way. 
 
 Let’s rediscover love in the times of emoji, peeps. *blush smiley emoji*
