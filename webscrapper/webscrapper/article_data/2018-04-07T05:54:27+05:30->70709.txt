CHENNAI: After four maternal deaths at fertility clinics in the state in eight months, the government has released strict norms for fertility clinics. The new rules - and a plan to open at least six fertility clinics in state-run hospitals - could prevent fatalities and make treatment in such facilities transparent and affordable. 

 The State Health Society, Tamil Nadu, which drafted the norms in association with the  , has started sending a seventeen-page protocol to doctors.
 
 The fatalities that spurred the government action were a result of fertility procedures going wrong in various fertility centres across the state in 2017; they included the deaths of a 51-year-old pregnant woman from   and a 48-year-old woman from Trichy. 
 
 "We did not have any protocol," said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. He said the government is attempting to bring the new regulations under the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishment (Regulations) Amendment Act. All fertility centres registered under the act will have to follow the guidelines, he said.
 
 Senior gynaecologists, who prepared the guidelines, said they ensured that the rules do not involve "moral policing".
