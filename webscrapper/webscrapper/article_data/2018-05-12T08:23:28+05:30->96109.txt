CHENNAI: The objective of an educational institution is to impart   and not to just issue certificates of qualification, as education is different from qualification, the Madras   observed while dismissing a plea moved by Alwin College of Education, Valasaravakkam, seeking direction to Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University to permit its 37 students to appear for university exams.

 The institute’s recognition was cancelled by the university for jumping rules.
 
 “Teaching profession is one of the noblest of  . It is teachers who have produced doctors lawyers and judges. If there is no quality and genuineness in the institutions which impart education, there is no possibility of getting quality teachers and we cannot expect such teachers to inculcate moral values to the children. The interest of the educational institution must be to impart education and not to issue   of qualification,” Justice S Vaidyanathan said.
 
 As recognition to the college was cancelled by the university, the institute wanted the court to direct the university to permit its 37 students admitted in 2016-2018 batch to appear in the university examinations as an interim relief.
