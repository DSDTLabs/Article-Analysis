AHMEDABAD:  , president of the Gujarat Fair Price Shop Owners and Kerosene License Holders Association, said the Gujarat government has just offered them “a lollipop” rather then considering their demands in the interest of the people of the state.

 “The Gujarat government claimed on Monday that Fair Price Shop owners and kerosene license holders are getting an income as the state provided them the facility to sell railway and air tickets. These are baseless and false claims by the government. 
 
 “Fair Price Shop owners can only get commission on distribution of essential commodities so the government should think about giving sufficient commission for that work, rather than showing us a lollipop,” Modi said.
 
 Modi on Sunday had announced that Fair Price Shop owners and kerosene license holders will go on an indefinite strike from May 28, if their demands are not met. The association has made various demands, ranging from approval to sell gas under the ‘Pradhanmantri Ujjwala Yojana’ to financial assistance for their children’s higher education.
 
 Gujarat has around 22,000 Fair Price Shop owners and kerosene license holders, who distribute essential commodities to around 1.2 crore   holders, including beneficiaries of   and   schemes. 
 
 Of the total, 65 lakh ration card holders come under the purview of National Food Security Act, while 55 lakh ration cards have been declared void.
