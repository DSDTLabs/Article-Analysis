KOLKATA: Six   opposite Eco Park have already been decorated with motifs inspired by Nandalal Bose’s sketches in Tagore’s ‘Sahaj Path’. And now, Hidco has planned to reproduce some famous   paintings on the pillars close to Nazrul Tirtha.

 There’s more in store for art lovers in the city. An exhibition of Jamini Roy paintings will be organised from August 8 to August 31 at Nazrul Tirtha in New Town. Fifty selected paintings of the legendary artist that are now preserved at Charukala Parishad will be on display for public viewing.
 
 The state information and cultural affairs (I&CA) department, Charukala Parishad and Hidco will hold the exhibition jointly. An expert committee of the government is at the final stages of selecting the paintings. Hidco authorities have been in touch with artist Jogen Chowdhury, who is also the chairman of Charukala Parishad, for coming up with the plan to hold the exhibition.
 
 “We are installing close-circuit cameras and will make extra security arrangements at Nazrul Tirtha for ensuring safety of the priceless art works,” said a Hidco official. The authorities are trying to get in touch with Roy’s relatives. They will be invited for the opening day of the exhibition that is scheduled to be inauguated by state urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim. A short documentary on Roy will be shown and a catalogue of his paintings will also be released on the occasion.
