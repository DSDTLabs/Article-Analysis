AURANGABAD: Alleged irregularities in the recruitment at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU) during 2012-13 have returned to haunt state education (higher) director Dhanraj Mane. 

 State education minister Vinod   on Thursday said the former BAMU registrar would be suspended for his role in filling up around 53 posts allegedly in violation of rules. 
 
 Tawde has also assured that a retired judge will investigate the alleged role of some higher education department officials, who tried to shield Mane, public representatives said.
 
 Mane served as BAMU registrar between December 20, 2011 and January 6, 2015 and was said to be at the helm of affairs related to recruitment, along with other authorities.
 
 Incidentally, the action against him came exactly a day after his probation period was over and orders were issued for his continuation of service on permanent basis. 
 
 After Subhash Sabne,   MLA from   in Nanded, raised the issue of recruitment in the state assembly, a few other MLAs including Sanjay Shirsath of Shiv Sena, Atul Save and   took part in the debate, prompting Tawde to make the statement.
 
 Following mounting complaints against the alleged irregularities in BAMU recruitment, the state education department had formed a three-member committee led by joint director of education Vithhal More to probe into charges levelled against Mane. More said that BAMU made certain delays in sharing key information pertaining to recruitment. 
 
 As per BAMU records, recruitment for 170 posts were advertised during Mane's tenure, of which 127 posts were filled. The registrar was solely responsible for scrutiny of applications meant for non-teaching posts.
 
 Mane, who is based at headquarters in Pune, could not be reached for his comments as his phone was switched off.
 
 When contacted, BAMU vice-chancellor B A Chopade said he was unaware of the development related to action against Mane.
