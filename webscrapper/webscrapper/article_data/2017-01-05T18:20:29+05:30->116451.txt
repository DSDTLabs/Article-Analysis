NAGPUR: The revaluation scam allegedly involving assistant registrar (Revaluation) Sandhya Chunodkar-Handa took another turn after   (AG) Rohit Deo cleared pro-VC Pramod Yeole’s name for taking a decision on punishment to be meted out to her.

 VC had sought   opinion from Deo, acting AG at that time, to clear the confusion on taking a decision on Handa’s fate.   was dilly-dallying on punishment to be meted out to her for over four years after TOI exposed the scam allegedly involving her, on July 8, 2012, where over 200 engineering students, including her son, were believed to be alleged beneficiaries.
 
 VC SP Kane confirmed that Deo, in the capacity of acting AG, had sent a detailed letter stating that pro-VC can take a decision on her in VC’s absence. “He (Yeole) would have full powers of a VC in this use for taking the decision. With this major legal hurdle was cleared,” he told TOI.
 
 The VC first took chancellor’s opinion, who suggested him to handover the probe to pro-VC. The pro-VC then took legal opinion from standing counsel Purushottam Patil, who told him that even he couldn’t take the decision on meting out punishment, as VC had constituted the panel. They then approached the AG.
 
 The disciplinary enquiry (DE) was conducted by lawyer Yogesh Dharashivkar, who submitted report to VC on June 8, 2015, two and half years after probe started. Officials confirmed that there was a recommendation to lodge FIR to go into the roots of the scam by the enquiry panel.   was indicted for her alleged role in the scam by DAC, then led by senior academician Eknath Kathale. The panel found her guilty of committing malpractices and misusing her powers of assistant registrar by increasing marks of re-totalling and reassessment of her son and others through unfair means. Four years on nothing has moved, apart from her suspension.
