NAGPUR: The state cabinet on Tuesday cleared the extra expenditure incurred by   on its six new units. The total revised and extra expenditure is about Rs4,356 crore. All the six new units have started generation. 

 The extra expenditure on 250MW new unit at Parli thermal power station is Rs706 crore. The extra expenditure on 500MW units 8 and 9 of   super thermal power station (CSTPS) is Rs1,504 crore while the extra expenditure on 660MW units 8, 9 and 10 of   thermal power station (KTPS) is Rs2,146 crore.
 
 The government had approved an expenditure of Rs5,500 crore for 500MW units 8 and 9 of CSTPS in March 2008. However, due to various reasons the total expenditure on these units was Rs7,004 crore. The cabinet allowed Mahagenco to borrow 80% of this amount — Rs1,203 crore from financial institutions while the remaining 20% — Rs301 crore would be paid by the state government as its share capital.
 
 The government had approved Rs11,880 crore for 660MW units 8, 9 and 10 of KTPS in October 2008. There was a delay in commissioning of the units by the contractor. While unit 8 is complete, units 9 and 10 are being run on commercial basis and Mahagenco is taking efforts to complete them soon. In this case too, cabinet permitted Mahagenco to raise 80% of extra expenses from financial institution and paid 20% amount as share capital.
 
 Unit 8 of Parli was sanctioned at the cost of Rs1,375 crore in May 2009. However, its cost increased by Rs706 crore due to various reasons.
