NEW DELHI:   on Thursday became the first batsman this Indian Primer League [IPL] season to score a century when he scored an unbeaten 104 off 63 to power   to what turned out to be a match-winning total. 

 
 His   team-mates seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed his assault on the Sunrisers Hyderabad bowlers in Mohali as they all rose in unison to applaud him from the team's dug-out.  , though, went a step ahead and brought out the 'Gangnam Style' dance as a tribute to 'Gaylestorm'.
 
  
  
 
 This was Gayle's second match-winning score in a row after top-scoring with 63 off 33 against Chennai Super Kings in a close four-run victory at Chandigarh.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 Following his rollicking century - his 21st in T20 cricket - Gayle has ensured that, fitness permitting, he will play all of KXIP's remaining matches. And in his inimitable style, the Jamaican gave credit to KXIP mentor   for having 'saved the IPL' by picking him in the auction. "I think Virender Sehwag saved the IPL by picking me (in the January auctions)," said Gayle with a big smile. Everyone says I have a lot to prove. I am just here to put some respect on my name."
 
 Gayle, 38, was released by   [RCB] before January's IPL player auction, and on day one of the auction had gone unsold. On the second day, KXIP made a bid for him and secured his services for his base price of Rs 2 crore. At that time, Sehwag had said Gayle will be worth the money should he be able to win KXIP at two-three matches. 
 
 He has already won them two so far and has reminded everyone he still has plenty of gas in the tank.
