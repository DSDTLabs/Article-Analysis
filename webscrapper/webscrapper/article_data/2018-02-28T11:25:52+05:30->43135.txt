CHENNAI: Kanchi acharya Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the 69th head of the centuries old mutt, passed away in Kancheepuram on Wednesday morning. He was 82.

  
 The acharya was rushed to ABCD Hospitals in Kancheepuram early in the morning after he complained of breathlessness. He was unconscious when brought to the hospital. His vital parameters, including blood pressure and pulse, were weak. He passed away despite doctors' efforts to revive him. 
 
 The last rites (brindavana pravesha karyakramam) of Jayendra Saraswathi will be performed at 8am on Thursday. His samadhi will be placed closer to his predecessor Chandrasekara Saraswathi. 
 
  
  
 Born in Irulneeki, a village in Tiruvarur district in 1935 as Subramania Mahadevan, Jayendra became a pontiff of the Kanchi Mutt in 1954 and was guided by Paramacharya Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi. 
 
 As per the mutt rules, the junior acharya will be anointed head of the mutt after the samadhi (demise) of the senior.
 
 
 
  
 
 Jayendra was in and out of hospital in the recent past. In January, he was brought to the Ramachandra Hospital in Porur here after he complained of breathlessness. Doctors said urea level in his blood was high but he refused treatment. 
 
 Jayendra and the junior acharya Vijayendra Saraswathi were arrested in connection with the murder of Sankararaman, manager of Varadaraja Perumal temple. Jayendra, who was the main accused in the case, was arrested on the Diwali day of 2004. He was acquitted by the Puducherry court in 2013.
