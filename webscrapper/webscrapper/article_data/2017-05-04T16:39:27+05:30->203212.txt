KOLHAPUR: Vehicle sales zoomed in Kolhapur around Akshay Tritiya, one of the three-and-a half auspicious muhurta, this year compared to last year.

 The   (RTO) Kolhapur registered 3,765 new   in the three days till Akshay Tritiya this year compared to 1,052 vehicles registered around the corresponding period last year. Officials and traders attributed the significant jump in sales to the good monsoon crop and high rates offered for cane by sugar mills. 
 
 Large tracts of land in Kolhapur are under sugar cane cultivation, earning it the tag of being the sugar bowl of Maharashtra. Sugar cane cultivation and prices are a driving force in this region and define the overall economic situation. 
 
 Regional transport officer   told  , “Akshay Tritya proved better for the automobile industry in the district this year. Sale of vehicle was very poor on   in 2016 due to poor showers. Owing to good monsoon and better prices to cash crops, sale of vehicle almost doubled this year on Akshay Tritiya.”
 
 He added that the office registered sale of 3,630 geared and non-geared two wheelers and 135 passenger cars. 
 
 City-based agricultural expert Ashok Pisal said sugar cane has the ability to offer more than your regular needs. Fix payments assure handsome incomes for farmers and they can buy luxurious things. “Farmer prefer to buy vehicles after meeting his regular needs. Unlike other crops, sugar cane does not require constant attention,” he said.
 
 Traders in the district were still not happy with the overall sales despite the increase. President of Kolhapur automobile dealers’ association Vijay Patil said, “Vehicles market has slowed down in last three years. Despite the increase recorded this year, vehicle sale did not live up our expectation. Many people grabbed the massive offers on vehicle purchase last month. Better agricultural activities brought out little cheer in market.”
