BENGALURU: Do you want to know your social, emotional and psychological wellbeing and how positive you are? Wellness-Check, an app developed by researchers from  , Bengaluru, tracks your wellbeing score based on an analysis of a survey.

 Wellness-Check, which can be through a computer and mobile phones, poses several questions about the user’s behaviour over the past month and pattern of activities. Boredom and irritability too are assessed.
 
 In 2016, Nimhans had launched its first app, PUSH-D (Practice and Use Self-Help for Depression) to help patients affected by depression. Wellness-Check, developed with funding from the Indian Council of Social Science Research, New Delhi, can be used to assess stress levels. “Wellness-Check is not a tool for psychiatric diagnosis. It is meant to increase mental health of people and inspire them to reflect on their current wellbeing and work towards enhancing it,” said the app’s principal investigator, Dr Seema  , professor at Nimhans.
 
 The internet-based program gives the user a break from the brisk pace of everyday life and reflect on health. It helps access basic information on ways to enhance wellbeing. 
 
 “We were discussing how Nimhans could reach out to the general public. The app gives a score after the user answers the questions and that is indicative of wellbeing,” says  , the app’s technology partner, E-Health Center, IIITB, Bengaluru. Dr Mehrotra also runs a positive mental health clinic called Flourish at the   for Wellbeing.
