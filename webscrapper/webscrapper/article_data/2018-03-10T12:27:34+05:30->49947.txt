PUNE: The   police on Thursday registered an offence against a central government employee for raping his 47-year-old colleague for over seven years, first promising marriage and then threatening to post her obscene photographs and clips on the social media.

 The woman approached the police when the suspect started threatening her to make her obscene photographs and video clips viral. “We have booked the suspect under sections 376 (rape) and 377 (unnatural offence) of IPC, and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act,” said an officer of the Bund Garden police.
 
 He said the 45-year-old suspect and the woman worked in the same office. The woman stated in her complaint that the suspect had been raping her from 2010 after promising to marry her. “The woman stated that the suspect used to rape her on the premises of their office and in a lodge on  ,” the officer said.
 
 He said the suspect clicked obscene photographs of the woman and recorded her video. “The woman stated in her complaint that when the suspect refused to marry her, she had started avoiding him. But the suspect used to rape her by threatening to post her photographs and videos on social media websites as well as on the porn sites,” the officer said.
 
 Frustrated by the harassment, the woman on Thursday lodged a complaint against the suspect. “We are yet to arrest him,” the officer said.
