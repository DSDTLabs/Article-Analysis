KOLKATA: Senior officers of Rifle Factory Ishapore ( ), along with a special task force of Kolkata Police, have taken stock of the security gaps noticed while probing the arms smuggling racket operating within the factory since 2008. 

 
 According to a source, they agreed upon immediate steps that need to be taken to stop such incidents from repeating. "From auditing scrap material and heightened vigilance during scrap loading to frisking of all employees after duty - every important step was taken into consideration. Details about the training and postings of the accused were also examined," said an officer.
 
 The development came on a day when the probe revealed that the two junior RFI officials accused of being involved in the arms racket had attended several training sessions to learn how to separate superior and inferior scrap material. "RFI junior works managers   and   had initially trained at Ishapore Metal and Steel Institute and joined as semi-steel artisans," an investigating officer said.
 
 "While Basu joined in 1988, Murmu joined in 1995. Since 2008, the duo has been involved in attending several trainings - some in places like Meerut, Kanpur and Dehradun. Basu had even actively pursued the management to allow him to train out of turn. This allowed him to develop the acumen to easily identity the better products," the officer said.
 
 Explaining the modus operandi, the police said the accused used a unique method to smuggle out items. "They would identify the good pieces of the rifles rejected by the panel appointed. They would then get arms dealer   to bring them a demand list from gangsters, after which the items would be smuggled out of the RFI compound," a source said.
