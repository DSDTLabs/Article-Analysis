GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had in 2016 announced the setting up of Gurugram’s second air quality monitoring station. The site — IMT Manesar —was finalised by the   officials, EPCA chairman Bhure Lal and members of the civic authority. 

 Two years have gone by but the city still has just one air quality monitoring machine at Vikas Sadan that was set up in 2012. 
 
 The pollution board has already missed two deadlines — October 2017 and January 2018 — for the machine’s installation. 
 
 Jai Bhagwan, the regional officer of HSPCB told TOI, “Nineteen air quality monitoring stations have been proposed in Haryana. The approval needs a procedure involving a high power purchase committee. As the procedure is a little long, it is taking time. However, things are in process and the city will soon have its second air quality monitoring machine.”
 
 In 2013-14, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had sanctioned 30 air quality monitoring stations for Haryana, including three in  . However, in July 2017, HSPCB decided to go ahead with 19 monitoring stations in the state.
 
 The lone ambient air quality monitoring station at Vikas Sadan measures pollution level in the radius of five to six kilometres. 
 
 The decision to install more stations in Gurugram was taken after the Supreme Court approved the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of CPCB. 
 
 GRAP gives out separate set of action plan depending on the levels of air quality — moderate, poor, very poor and severe.
