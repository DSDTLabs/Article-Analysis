RANCHI:   constructed across the city by   will finally be opened for   from today, a month later after the construction was completed. 

 Of the 80 proposed toilets, RMC has managed to construct only 32, which were kept locked for a month since the corporation was unable to come across any organization to maintain them. Arranging for water supply was another reason which prevented the use of these toilets.
 
 However, now that the Swachh Survekshan team is scheduled to arrive on January 20 for a three-day survey, RMC has decided to open these toilets. Ranchi is among those 500 cities across the country which will be surveyed and community toilets plays a crucial factor in it.
 
 Executive engineer of RMC and nodal officer of Swachh Bharat Mission Pramod Bhatt said, "We have given the maintenance work of these toilets to a private agency,  , who constructed the toilets, for a month."
 
 He added, "Meanwhile, we have issued a tender for operation and maintenance which will be finalized soon, following which the work will be handed over to the selected agency."
 
 As far as providing water to these toilets is concerned, it has been decided that these toilets will be supplied water through the RMC pipeline, while water to the remaining toilets will be supplied through tankers.
 
 The budget for constructing a single toilet is Rs 1.20 lakh. While construction of two toilets will cost Rs 2.40 lakh, three will cost Rs 3 lakh and four will cost Rs 4 lakh.
 
 RMC officials have also directed Sulabh International Social Service Organisation, which has been maintaining the toilets in the city for a long time, to prepare for the survey. 
 
 Bhatt said, "The organisation went a bit lax in the maintenance work, so we warned them and asked them to gear up. Now, they have also started cleaning and renovating the toilets which were in poor conditions."
