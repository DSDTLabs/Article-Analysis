CHENNAI: The state government will build a new bridge over the railway tracks in the   area to replace the existing bridge that is weak and banned for trucks and cars. 

 Municipal administration and water supply minister S P Velumani made this announcement in the assembly on Wednesday, responding to DMK's P K Sekar Babu plea on the inconvenience caused to motorists by the restrictions on the bridge. 
 
 "The railways and   have decided to take up the work jointly, with a 50:50 share of funding, to construct a new bridge, demolishing the existing one," Velumani said. The railways has said a detailed project report and designs were getting ready, he said. To add more railway lines,   proposed to widen the bridge from 47m to 150m, he said. The corporation will prepare a report on approach roads after getting the railways DPR.
 
 Currently, vehicles heading towards the bridge are diverted via Basin Bridge, Rajah Muthiah Salai and EVR Periyar Salai. Corporation sources told TOI there were issues with the proposed 50:50 financial model as it didn't cover land acquisition costs. 
 
 "Land acquisition would be necessary if the new bridge should be broader. It will cost a huge sum," an official said. The widening would result in an engineering problem, he said. "The approach to   would result in a deep slope. This can be averted if the rail track work is taken up towards the Salt Cotaurs side."
 
 Besides, any dispute over land acquisition would result in a delay. Corporation officials estimate the DPR preparation and acquisition assessment would take eight months.
