NAVI MUMBAI: The road and footpaths concretization work going on along the 6.7-km   railway line has got residents concerned for the well-being of around 100 trees, which are in the way. The authorities are giving little to no thought to conserving the greenery that is beneath the upcoming metro line, alleged local residents.

 “The concretization work is starting from sector 7, which is also known as Rain Tree Marg, The authorities have failed to leave the mandatory space around the roots. Development work should not be done by damaging the existing natural resources,” said a resident from the sector.
 
 Chandramohan Nair, another resident, said that there are some trees in sector 12 planted on both sides of road leading from Belpada to Belapur that may dry out due to lack of space for roots to grow. “Either the contractors are ignoring the norms due to lack of proper overseeing by Cidco or there are no guidelines stated for this,” he added.
 
 Even as   (NGT) has stated that ample non-concretized space should be left around trees but activists says the ground reality is different. Such violations have been observed even in areas under NMMC jurisdiction, they added.
 
 “A quick glance at sector 19, Nerul is all that is required to understand the situation. There is no room left for the roots to breathe or expand further,” said social activist Arati Chauhan.
 
 Cidco has been asked to rectify the mistake." We are in receipt of such grievances and necessary action has already been taken. Space is being left around the roots and the horticulture department is also conducting site inspection to ensure that the norms are adhered,” said an Cidco official. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
