NAGPUR:   has lashed out at schools over lax safety in   and issued guidelines for them to follow. K Srinivasan, board’s deputy secretary (affiliation), wrote, “time has come to make the schools sensitive to this serious issue” and warned that school management would be held responsible for any lapse. The board has suggested schools should have at least one parent travelling in the buses to monitor if safety norms were being implemented or not.

 He wrote that the guidelines of CBSE regarding school bus safety should be scrupulously followed and any faux pas by school will “invite appropriate action including the disaffiliation of the school as per provisions”. The board mentioned that recent “unfortunate instances reported in the media about callous approach by certain schools with respect to the safety of school children during transit to and fro the school have again agitated deep concern regarding the safety of school children”.
 
 Srinivasan went on to add, “faith, trust and responsiblity reposed in schools by parents should be the cardinal guiding beacon for every school to meet the expectations and contribute towards nurturing of young citizens of the country.”
 
 In the guidelines, schools have been mandated to have a lady attendant in each bus to attend to the children and ensure their safety during transit. It has also been mandated that bus interior should be such even from outside all activities inside the bus are visible when plying on the road. For this reason, it is prohibited to install any kind of curtain or darkened glasses. CBSE also clarified that if the transport system was outsourced there should be a proper agreement with owner/transporter of the school bus and the driver shall at all times carry a copy of the agreement.
