GURUGRAM: A city court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail application of Class 11 student of  , Bhondsi, who is accused of murdering seven-year-old   of the same school.

 The court of additional sessions Judge   is likely to pronounce the judgment on Monday (January 8).
 
 On Saturday, during the one-and-a-half-hour hearing, the CBI counsel as well as the lawyer representing Pradhyumn’s father Barun Thakur opposed the bail application. The CBI contended that the investigation was at a crucial stage and that the agency was yet not record the statements of some witnesses. The juvenile, if granted bail, could temper with evidence, influence and intimidate the witnesses, it argued.
 
 Barun’s counsel Sushil Tekriwal too said, “The crime committed is of serious nature and the suspect should not be granted bail.”
 
 Juvenile’s counsel Sandeep Aneja, on the other hand, argued that under the section 10(5) of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016, the agency should have completed the investigation with one month of the detention or arrest of the child and submit a chargesheet. “As CBI has failed to complete the probe within the given time, the child should be given the benefit of default bail,” said Aneja.
 
 Countering Aneja, the CBI counsel argued that the rules nowhere spoke about completion of the investigation within one month. The agency further said in the present case, in which a student of above 16 years of age is involved in a serious crime, it was not bound to file the chargesheet in 30 days.
 
 Aneja has filed two more applications — one to oppose the JJ Board’s order allowing CBI to take fingerprint of the juvenile, and the second to challenge the legality of the child’s CBI custody between November 8 and 11. The court will hear all these appeals on January 22.
