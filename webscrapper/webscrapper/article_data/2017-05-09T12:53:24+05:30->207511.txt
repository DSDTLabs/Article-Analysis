KORAPUT: The   (Iffco) will open an e-bazaar at Kunduli haat (weekly market) under   block in the   district soon to bring the farmers under the digital platform and to ensure that they never run short of fertilisers.

 In this regard, the Iffco has signed an MoU with the regional market committee ( ) of Koraput. 
 
 Through the e-bazaar, the Iffco will sell various types of fertilisers used by the farmers. "At present, farmers are purchasing fertilisers from licensed traders in the market and most of the time they are being cheated in quality and quantity," said  , secretary RMC, Koraput.
 
 By purchasing fertiliser from the e-bazaar, the quality of fertiliser will not only be ensured but also there will never be shortage of fertiliser, he added. 
 
 Officials said the the e-bazaar will be a place of cashless transaction. It will integrate the farmers with the digital platform and empower them by giving them access to knowledge and help them work together to get a better produce. The farmers will be provided agricultural inputs under a single roof. 
 
 Officials said around 8,000 farmers of Pottangi and Semiliguda blocks in the district will be immediately benefitted by the e-bazaar. 
 
 The electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), a pan-India electronic portal with network among the existing agricultural produce marketing committees, launched by the Union government, has started functioning at Kunduli haat from this month.
 
 Officials said produces like ginger and potato of the district have been included under the e-NAM and traders from across the country are purchasing these products through online bidding. 
 
 Till now over 2,000 farmers have been registered under the e-NAM. "To encourage more farmers to enrol themselves in the e-NAM, we have launched programmes like free transportation of commodities to the haat, cash benefits for the farmers and free medical check-up of farmers at the haat," said Padhi.
