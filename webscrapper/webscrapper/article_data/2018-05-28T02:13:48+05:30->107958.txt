MUMBAI: All over the world, beach fronts are most sought-after as important and necessary recreational spaces for society, UN environment chief   said on Sunday. At   beach after almost a year to launch World Environment Day 2018 events, which India is hosting, he said, "First when I had come, it was unbelievable. Now, things are better.'' 

  Solheim said, "People need to avoid what they don't need and stop single-use plastics such as straws, cups, plates and spoons. Stop buying two apples in a plastic tray and wrapped in plastic.''
 
 Solheim, who officially inaugurated the divers' team and special wet and dry segregation waste cycles and boats to clean up mangroves and creeks, recounted to the 6,000 who showed up, a "moving story'' that PM   had narrated to him when they met. Modi, he said, told him of his "very modest'' background and how when once his grandfather spoke of chopping trees in a forest for livelihood, Modi's grandmother rebuked him by saying, they may be poor but she forbade harming the environment and living things, just to make a living.
 
  chief Aditya Thackeray said, "What the over two-year beach clean-up has really done is create a magical awareness among society. It will lead to great changes.'' School students, IIT (Powai) students (Abhyudaya group), cadets and personnel from Coast Guard, CRPF and  , as well as corporate social response teams lined up to do their bit.
