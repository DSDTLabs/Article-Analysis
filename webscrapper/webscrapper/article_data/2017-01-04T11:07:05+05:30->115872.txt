  While the trio is sipping in wine and enjoying their win, Alia is more concerned about why Purab ( ) agreed to whatever she said and confessed his love for Pragya ( ) in front of Abhi ( ) and the rest of the guests at party. She is disturbed and thinks if Purab has actually fallen for Pragya. It is then, Tanu and Nikhil ask her to relax as they were able to convince Abhi of their romance.
  
  
 
  
  Meanwhile, Pragya, Dadi and Dasi question Purab's intentions towards Pragya as all of them are utterly shocked about his confessions. Pragya is in tears and says all sorts of things to Purab, but the latter is adamant on saying that he did it for her good.
