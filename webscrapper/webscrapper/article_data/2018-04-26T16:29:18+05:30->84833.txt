NEW DELHI: A curious thing happens when you type in the words ' ' into  's search bar since late Wednesday.

 
 The search engine correctly spits out the answer in the form of a Wikipedia link right up top which says Jawaharlal Nehru was India's first Prime Minister. But the photograph that comes with the information is decidedly not that of Nehru. It's of  . Oops.
 
 This mess-up prompted even   social media in-charge   to comment , and she sounded distinctly annoyed:
 
 "@Google @GoogleIndia what algorithm of yours allows this?! You're so full of junk-", tweeted Spandana.
 
  
  
 When one clicks on the Wikipedia link, 'List of Prime Ministers in India', the page correctly describes the Prime Minister's position in India and accurately lists all the country's PMs in the right order - and with the correct photographs next to them.
 
 
 
 If onr didn't bother to click through, though, someone unfamiliar with the country's leaders could well believe Modi is Nehru. By Thursday afternoon, after the issue was brought to   India's attention, it fixed the issue.
