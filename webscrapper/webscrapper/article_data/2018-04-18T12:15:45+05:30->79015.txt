MADIKERI/ BENGALURU: The   high command is believed to have second thoughts on fielding former state public prosecutor H S Chandramouli from Madikeri assembly constituency, in view of the   whipping up a campaign that he had appeared for diamond businessman  , uncle of Punjab National Bank scam accused  , in a cheating case in   high court.

 
 Bengalurean SV Hariprasad had filed a police complaint in 2015 that Choksi had cheated him of crores of rupees after he became a franchisee of the latter’s Gitanjali Gems. After Bengaluru police filed a B report in the incident, Hariprasad moved a magistrate court which ordered the CID to continue its probe in the case. Choksi later moved the Karnataka high court against the magistrate court order and obtained a stay in the matter.
 
 Chandramouli claimed that he did not know Choksi personally and the case was referred to him by another lawyer. He said the ethics of his profession demanded that he appear in the court but he did not take up that case.
 
 Congress sources said Chandramouli was given the ticket as he is a Lingayat and the community constitutes a major chunk in the constituency. “We have lost both constituencies in Kodagu district for years and want to regain them. The calculation was that Lingayat, minorities and Scheduled Castes would help the Congress this time,’’ they added.
 
 The BJP latched on to the controversy after Congressman Brijesh Kalappa, a ticket aspirant from Madikeri, tweeted on Monday: “I have never represented Mehul Choksi nor have I been given the party nomination.” The party is now considering fielding Kalappa and K P Chandrakala, a Vokkaliga and sister of Kannada actor Jai Jagadish, from Madikeri.
