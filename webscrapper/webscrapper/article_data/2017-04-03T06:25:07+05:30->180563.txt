BAREILLY:   corporators in   have decided to sing ‘Vande Mataram’ at the start of every board meeting of the Bareilly municipal corporation (BMC). The corporators claimed that a resolution regarding this had already been passed by the board years ago, but the erstwhile   government had put the brakes on it. As of now, the BMC board has a majority of SP corporators and it is likely that the upcoming session of the board will be a stormy affair.

 “I have spent four terms here as a corporator and singing ‘Vande Mataram’ before every board meeting was a practice before SP’s Dr IS Tomar became the mayor,” said Vikas Sharma, leader of BJP corporators. “We have now unanimously decided to sing the   ahead of every board meeting of the civic body,” he added.
 
 Speaking with TOI, SP corporator Rajesh Agarwal said, “Taking a cue from the Meerut incident, the BJP corporators are trying to create controversy in Bareilly as well. The song has been sung by BJP corporators at BMC for a long time. But those who did not wish to participate were never forced to sing.” When contacted, Bareilly mayor Dr IS Tomar said, “As of now, I am not aware of any such development.   has never been sung in the board meetings of BMC.”
