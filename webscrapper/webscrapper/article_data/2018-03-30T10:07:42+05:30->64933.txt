MOHALI: A seven-year-old boy got stuck in a pit in a Phase VII park on Thursday when he was trying to retrieve a ball. The boy,  , was crying and screaming when spotted by a passer-by, who called fire brigade and the police. Soon, locals gathered in the park.

 One fire tender, a   machine and police reached the spot. The fire officials dug up the sides of the pit and took him out. The operation to recuse the boy went on for around 20 minutes, but melee continued for an hour.
 
 Sachin was playing cricket with his friends. He followed the ball that entered the pit. He lowered himself into it but as the walls were narrow, he got stuck. Only his neck was out. 
 
 Meian Vati, his mother who works as a maid, said, “I was working in a house and had left Sachin in the park to play with his friends. I want to thank the man who called the police and saved his life.”
 
 Constable   said, “The boy was crying when we reached. Rescuing him was not difficult as all we had to do was remove the soil around him and create space. Parents should not leave kids alone.”
