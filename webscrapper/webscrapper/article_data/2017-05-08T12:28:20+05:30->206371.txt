YEMANUR (DHARMAPURI DIST): Villages in   district have lost more cattle than those in   district. Koppalur,  , Yemanur, Yeriyur, West Yemanur, Yemanur Colony, Athu Mettur, Singapuram, Saraswathi Nagar and   in the district are the most affected by the devastating drought that has claimed the lives of hundreds of head of cattle. Families have lost up to 15 cows due to starvation. "I have lost 15 of my 20 cows and bulls," said M Govindammal, 45, of Yemanur. 

 She told TOI that she sold the rest for 2,000 each to butchers. "All the cows were fully grown. They initially offered only 1,000 for one cow. When we stuck to the rate, the butchers agreed to buy it for 2,000 each," she said. 
 
 P Kandan, 58, of the same village lost five of his 10 cows. "I don't have the strength to see my cows die. So it was with a heavy heart that I had sold them to butchers," he lamented. K Chinnathambi, 70, of Neruppur village lost nine cows and bulls till date. "Three other cows went missing about two days ago. I still haven't located them," he said, adding that they too might have died on the fringes of the forest like hundreds of others.
 
 Villagers claim that at least 1,000 cows and bulls died of starvation in Dharmapuri district alone. "Each village lost at least 100 bulls and cows in less than a month," they said.
 
 The villagers said they have lost hundreds of goats too due to the drought. More than 2,000 goats died in the past two months, they claim. "I lost 100 of my 500-odd goats in April," said M Veerappan of Koppalur village. He said that he had sold the remaining goats for a meagre price.
 
 P Manoharan of   village in Salem district also lost 32 of his 60 sheep in March and April. When he tried to sell the remaining goats, the butchers offered just 2,000 per goat. "Earlier they gave 5,000 per goat," he said. The villagers urged the district administration and state government to take steps to save their livestock.
