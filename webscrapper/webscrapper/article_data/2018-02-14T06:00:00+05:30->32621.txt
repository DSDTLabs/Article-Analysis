Kolkata: West Bengal has the least tree cover among major states barring Punjab that is agriculturally and industrially more advanced. Though the state has recorded a marginal increase in greenery beyond its forests, it is still less than 2.5% of the state’s geographical area spread over 88,752 sq km. 

 The latest edition of the State of Forest Report 2017 released on Monday pegged West Bengal’s tree cover at 2,136 sq km, up from 2,088 sq km recorded in the previous report published two years ago. While Maharashtra has the highest tree cover spread across 9,831 sq km, even Rajasthan that is considered an arid state has close to four times Bengal’s tree cover at 8,266 sq km. 
 
 The report takes into account small patches of trees in less than 1 hectare such as plantations, trees alongside roads and canals as well as scattered trees that are not captured by satellite sensors used to map forest cover. These trees are captured with the help of high resolution remote sensing data and supplemented by field inventory data of trees outside forest.
 
 The report also looks at mangroves, a critical ecosystem that faces constant pressure due to rise in human population in coastal areas and the resultant rising demand for timber, fodder, fuel wood and other non-wood forest products.
 
 Thanks to Sunderbans, the mangrove cover in Bengal remains the highest among states and is nearly half the mangrove cover of the entire country. In the past two years, it has increased marginally from 2,106 sq km to 2,114 sq km. Of this, very dense mangrove is spread over 999 sq km, moderately dense mangrove over 692 sq km, and open mangrove over 423 sq km.
