NEW DELHI: The governing body of   will meet on Saturday to discuss the proposal of its autonomy. Opposing the move, DU Teacher’s Association (DUTA) will stage a protest in front of the college on the same day.

 DUTA president Nandita Narain questioned the principal’s move to call for an emergent   on a weekend “when most of the teachers are absent.”
 
 She believes it is “an agenda of the Centre to push for the autonomy of colleges in DU so that they can be self-reliant and would need no government funds” she said.
 
 “It is in contravention of the UGC guidelines which will lead to commercialisation of education. It will lead to higher fees and will eventually affect those from deprived sections to access quality education,” Narain said. 
 
 She also raised concerns over not including students and karamcharis in the decision making process.
 
 Sachin N, member of DU’s academic council and assistant professor of English at   called it an “illegal and unwelcome bypassing of the statutory body.”
 
 In an open letter to the VC he said, “The act of proposing autonomous status is a grave impropriety and illegality on your part as there was no sanction of the academic council to this effect. Neither was any proposal of this nature part of the agenda of the AC meetings nor were any discussion, deliberation or decision in the AC.”
