VADODARA: An unidentified man broke into the house of   and former   Chirag Zaveri in Manjalpur during the wee hours of Monday and fled with gold ornaments and   worth Rs 2.64 lakh.

 Zaveri told the police that the thief broke into his house from the first floor at around 3 am. The police said that the thief took the bag, in which ornaments were kept, to the kitchen. 
 
 He also searched other drawers of the room but did not find anything there, the cops said. On his way out, the thief also took away Zaveri’s mobile phone.
 
 When Zaveri woke up in the morning, he found that his room was latched from outside. He called up his son who was sleeping on second floor of the house but even his room was latched. “I later called up my neighbours who got into the house through a ladder and then opened the door,” said Zaveri. The police have checked the CCTV footages of his house in which the thief’s face is visible.
 
 This is the second time when Zaveri’s house was burgled. In April 2013 too, six persons had attempted to burgle Zaveri’s house. All six, including a former driver of Zaveri, were arrested within hours of the attempt.
