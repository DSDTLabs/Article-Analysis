PATNA: The Common Law Admission Test ( ) 2018, gateway for admission to 19 national law universities in the country, concluded at 15 centres across the state on Sunday. Some of the aspiring lawyers, who wrote the examination in the city, said the overall question paper was hard, while the mathematics part was the toughest.

 “I struggled with mathematics. It was the most difficult section,” said Aryan Kumar Tiwari, who completed his Intermediate in commerce from Patna Central School.
 
 Kshitij Raj, another student from Bettiah, said, “Being a science student, mathematics was moderate for me, but it was really lengthy and I took a very long time to solve the questions. For a student from any other stream, mathematics was really the toughest section. The rest of the sections were easy. This year’s question paper was comparatively easier than the previous year”.
 
 Similarly, Lalit Singh Chandel, another student who appeared for the test, said, “Logical reasoning and legal aptitude were really easy. However, maths was a little difficult. The overall question paper was moderately hard for those whose weak point is mathematics.”

 Ajay Kumar, observer at one of the centres in the city, said, “No discrepancies were reported at my centre. Of the 239 registered students, 233 appeared for the test at the centre.” Pratyush Kaushik, another observer, echoed Kumar’s tone.
