CHANDIGAH: The   and   high court has directed secretary of the   to appear before it on the next date of hearing in a case related to self-financing housing scheme for UT employees. The high court has asked about the status of this scheme and how and when it was going to be implemented.

 
 The high court was informed last year by the Chandigarh administration that 11.795 acres would be allotted to the housing board for the said project and for this the high court has directed the Chandigarh Housing Board secretary to appear before it by May 23.
 
 The self-financing housing scheme for the UT employees was announced nearly a decade ago, but it has remained on paper. This matter is also pending before the high court that had earlier rapped the UT administration a number of times for this.
 
 Litigants are seeking directions from the court to the Chandigarh Housing Board and other respondents to implement the scheme on leasehold basis for 99 years.
 
 The draw of lots was held on November 4, 2010, and approximately 3,950 employees were successful in the bid. However, nothing concrete was apparently done by the Chandigarh Housing Board.
 
 Even acceptance-cum-demand letters were not issued to the successful applicants. As per conditions imposed by the Chandigarh Housing Board authorities, the petitioners could not apply or buy any other property in the Tricity till the possession of flats was given to the successful allottees.
