NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court reserved its order on the plea of   seeking contempt action against the students for violating the court's order on August 9, 2017, by holding protests within 100 metres of the administrative block. 

 The court directed parties to file a written submission till Wednesday.
 
 JNU had earlier moved the Delhi high court claiming that its order asking students not to protest within 100 metres of the administrative block was being violated. The university's plea sought contempt action against the students who allegedly violated the court order. The HC was informed that the students had on February 15 violated the August 9, 2017 order of the high court by obstructing access to the administrative block of the university in protest against compulsory attendance.
 
 The court had on August 9 last year asked the JNU students not to protest within 100 metres radius of the administrative block which houses several offices, including that of the vice-chancellor. HC had in February this year, in an interim order, restrained JNU students from obstructing the VC and other senior staff from entering the administrative block to carry out their work.
