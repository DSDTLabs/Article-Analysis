KOLKATA: Wednesday was Kolkata’s   of the year so far, with the maximum temperature shooting up to 37.5 degrees Celsius. It was also the warmest March 14 in at least five years.

 Warm northwesterly winds were pushing the mercury up, but there is still no system in south   to pull the temperature down, said the Met office. The rest of the week could remain warm with maximum temperature hovering between 36 and 37 degrees till March 20. But the rising heat could help to create conditions to precipitate nor’westers, weathermen said.
 
 
 Deputy director-general of meteorology, IMD   said, “Hot northwesterly winds are now sweeping through south Bengal. They have pushed the mercury up. Also, we are approaching spring equinox on March 21 when the sun is going to shine directly on the Equator. This makes the weather warm in tropical countries like India. So, unless we have a system in the region that can precipitate thundershower, the mercury will remain high.”
 
 But he added that the rising heat will also help to create conditions necessary for nor’westers.Nor’westers are generated when hot winds over the   plateau create a lowpressure zone which sucks in moisture from the sea.
 
 The real feel temperature (actual impact of the heat on skin), too, crossed 42 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.
 
 It takes into account factors like wind direction, humidity, angle of sun rays, temperature, sunshine intensity, cloudiness, precipitation and elevation.
