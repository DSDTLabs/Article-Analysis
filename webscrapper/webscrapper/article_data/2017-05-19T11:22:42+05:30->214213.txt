BENGLURU: Passengers who lose things at   ( ) can now log onto the   to check the lost-and-found section and see items recovered at the airport and claim them. The section went up online last week. 

 About 30 items, from bags and identity cards to walking sticks and clothing, are left behind by passengers at the airport, said airport authorities. The most commonly forgotten items are wallets and mobile phones.
 
 On Tuesday, 45 lost items were recovered at the airport, including two debit cards, six bags and backpacks, one birth certificate, six identity cards and a flask.
 
 The lost and found section on the website allows users to enter the date when the item was lost. A list of all items recovered on that day is displayed. If the user’s lost item is among them, he or she can contact the airport authorities, provide the required documents and claim the item.
 
 “If you are owner of the article you need a copy of your boarding pass, details of the item being claimed for verification and government-issued ID proof to take back your property from the airport,” said an airport spokesperson.
 
 Lost items are kept for three months from the date of deposit and are disposed if not claimed within this period. Bank cards, cheque books and pass books are disposed of after seven days. Perishable items are disposed of within 24 hours. Unattended bags with the potential to raise a security threat undergo security screening and administrative charges are levied on such items.
