PUNE: The Pune railway police on Saturday arrested two suspects, who were wanted in connection with a robbery on board the   train when it had halted at the Kedgaon railway station under the jurisdiction of Daund police on the night of January 11. 

 One of the suspects was nabbed from the spot by alert passengers and railway police force (RPF) staff when the incident occurred but, his two associates managed to escape. The duo’s arrest was made following an interrogation of the first suspect, police said. 
 
 The train halted on platform no 1 at Kedgaon railway station from 8.25pm to 10pm on Thursday. It was then that the trio struck in the general coach behind the diesel engine. One of the witnesses,   (50) of Phursungi, and a couple of RPF patrol staff were alerted by shouts of ‘chor, chor’ emerging from the general coach and they rushed to the spot. 
 
 They witnessed the trio assaulting some passengers and forcibly taking money from their pockets. On seeing the RPF staff, the trio started running away. But Pawar and the RPF staff managed to apprehend one of the suspects, who was identified as   (37) of Kedgaon. His two associates managed to flee with Rs 1,800. 
 
 Later, passengers lodged a complaint with the government railway police at the Pune railway station and the probe was handed over to the Daund police. A police team visited the crime scene and then questioned Jadhav regarding the identity and whereabouts of his two other accomplices. Jadhav named his accomplices and their addresses. 
 
 Consequently, a team nabbed the duo,   (32) and   (20), both residents of Kedgaon, from their homes and also recovered the robbed cash. Inspector   of the government railway police’s local crime branch and sub-inspector Vishnu Gosavi led the police team that cracked the case under supervision of GRP superintendent Prabhakar Budhwant.
