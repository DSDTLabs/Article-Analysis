KOLKATA: Developers of two high-rises in the city have moved the Delhi high court after the   (AAI) revised the earlier height clearances issued to them, requiring demolition of several floors as they were obstructing navigational equipment signals.

 The projects -'The 42', a 63-storey residential tower in Chowringhee, and 'The V Kolkata', a 40-storey service apartment next to Westin, were initially permitted to construct 268 metre and 142 metre, respectively, in 2011 and 2009. The permission is valid for five years. If construction is not completed within that period, the developers are required to apply for a fresh NOC from the AAI. According to airport officials, both projects were not completed within the specified period, triggering a fresh assessment. In the meantime, both the radar and VOR at the airport were shifted, leading to a change in the height restriction of buildings. For 'The 42', the new height granted was 190 metre. For 'The V' too, the he ight clearance was lowered. AAI then sent a letter to KMC seeking demolition of the floors so that the buildings could confirm to its new height.
 
 Both developers have since moved Delhi high court to seek relief, citing that they had been granted clearance and had gone ahead with construction accordingly.
