The   has sounded the poll bugle for 2017. Commentators have billed UP state elections as crucial for the BJP. There has been much drama already amidst a family feud in the ruling   over candidate selection for the upcoming elections. Some have speculated that the recent demonetisation initiative was motivated by the UP elections. But rational analysis of the 2014   elections reveals that a   victory in UP in 2017 should be a foregone conclusion. Or perhaps, it may not be all that rational.

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP won a whopping 328 (81%) of the 403 assembly segments in UP, unprecedented in the recent history of UP elections. Not only did the BJP win 81% of segments, but it did so by a massive margin. Historically in UP, a four-cornered, first-past-the-post system meant that the winning party needed only 25-30% of votes in every constituency.
 
 The BJP won more than 30% vote share in 324 constituencies, more than 40% in 253 and an outright majority (>50%) in 94 constituencies in the 2014 elections. To put that in context, the SP won an outright majority in a mere 15 constituencies in 2012 and 2014 even though it won the overall state in those polls.
 
 More electors in UP voted for the BJP in 2014 than they did for SP and   combined.The sheer scale and enormity of the BJP victory in UP just three years ago should have ideally meant that here is only one plausible outcome in the 2017 elections Â­ a BJP victory. Yet, there seems to be a palpable excitement over other possible outcomes.
 
 For the BJP to get less than 200 seats and lose UP in 2017, it would take nearly 15% of its core supporters from the 2014 election to switch loyalties en masse to another party.
 
 If any two of the opposition parties get together, the BJP would still have to lose more than 10% of its 2014 voters to lose the 2017 UP election. While this is theoretically possible, it would take such a ' ' type vote swing for the BJP to win less than 200 seats in UP. To put this in context, the BJP lost the Bihar elections of 2015 after winning it in 2014, by having no more than 4% of its voters switch loyalties. The BJP would need a performance nearly four times worse than Bihar to lose UP, given its magnitude of victory in 2014.
 
 The expected counter to this analysis is that voters vote differently for state and national elections. This is perhaps one of the long-held myths about Indian elections for which there is scant evidence. Typically , people compare state and national elections held at different time periods to argue that people vote differently without accounting for the fact that other things have also changed in that time. When state and Lok Sabha elections are held simultaneously with all other things being equal, 77% of the voters choose the same party and do not differentiate between a state and national elections.
 
 Despite this, even if one were to accept that voters may vote differently for state elections vis-a-vis the national one, that alone cannot explain a BJP loss in UP. This is by no means a prediction of the UP election but to merely highlight what it would take for the BJP to lose from its peak of 2014.
 
 The BJP's performance in UP in 2014 is so stunning that an outright majority in the 2017 UP elections should have been par for the course. It was on the back of this astounding performance in UP that the BJP rode to a majority in the Lok Sabha in 2014 for the first time ever in its history. Should the BJP secure less than 200 seats in the 2017 UP election, it would only mean that a large number of voters in UP were disappointed with their 2014 decision. 
 
 It would also, perhaps, go down as among the most significant vote-share swings in India's electoral history comparable only with the magnitude of the vote share loss of the   party between the 1971 and the post-Emergency 1977 elections in UP . Only under this scenario, will the 2017 UP electoral outcome be a true harbinger for the 2019 national elections, not otherwise.
