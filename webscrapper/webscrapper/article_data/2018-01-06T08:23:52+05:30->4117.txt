HYDERABAD: A city-based district   has directed auto major   India Pvt Ltd and its authorized dealer to pay ₹14 lakh to a consumer for selling him adefective car.

 Gunaranjan C filed a petition with the forum stating that he purchased a Nissan Evalia XL from Lakshmi Nissan, Narayanaguda, for ₹11.9 lakh on January 9, 2015. Soon after, he noticed three problems — continuous noise in the gear box and body vibration, the second was that the car kept drifting towards the left side of the road, and lastly, poor vehicle suspension.
 
 When he approached Lakshmi Nissan, he was asked to take the vehicle to the service center at Kukatpally, where the mechanic told him that the right shock absorber was not functioning properly due to a technical defect and had to be replaced.
 
 However, issues continued to plague the vehicle and on March 13, 2016, it broke down on the highway when Gunaranjan was travelling from Anantapur to Hyderabad. At the service center, he was informed there are serious defects and about 22 parts need to be replaced.
 
 Claiming that Nissan Motors and its dealer cheated him by selling a defective car, he sent them a legal notice but received no response from them, after which he approached the forum seeking refund and compensation.
 
 Nissan Motors told the forum it deals with all its dealers on a principal-principal basis and is not responsible for the problems mentioned in the complaint.
 
 Lakshmi Nissan and its manager claimed that the car does not have any defect and is in fairly good condition and that they addressed all the problems whenever the vehicle was brought into the service center.
 
 Awarding relief, the bench said: “The fact that the problems the complainant was suffering could not be rectified in spite of service/repair of the vehicle from time-to-time, leads to an irresistible conclusion that there is manufacturing defect.”
