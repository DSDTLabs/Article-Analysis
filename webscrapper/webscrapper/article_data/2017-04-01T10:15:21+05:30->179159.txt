AHMEDABAD: Representatives of the Gujarat State Self-Financed School Management Association will hold a   on Saturday to discuss the new   (Regulation of Fees) Bill 2017. The bill has imposed a cap of Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000, and Rs 27,000 respectively on the annual fees of primary, secondary, and higher secondary schools. The association members are at loggerheads with the government and may consider legal action.

 The meeting on Saturday is expected to draw management representatives of more than 12,000 schools from Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Saurashtra. The executive committee meeting will discuss how the matter should be represented to the government as schools feel that it is impossible to run institutions with limited funds, said  , the president of the association. The meeting will also focus on uniting members so that they can collectively represent the matter clearly to the government. 
 
 Seeking an   beyond the threshold will be discussed by the members too. Since any   will be protracted, the executive committee will discuss matters such as consulting a lawyers’ panel. “We will also study the Acts of other states and accordingly think of possible solutions,” said Kachhadiya. “The action to be taken in future and the programmes to be organized to address the issue will also be decided.”
