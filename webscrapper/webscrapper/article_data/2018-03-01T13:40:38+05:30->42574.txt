INDORE: Tension prevailed at the accident site near   after Khan Badodiya   took to road and blocked vehicular movement shouting slogans against police officials and administration.

 Traffic flow was affected for nearly an hour at the site. The commuters going to and fro Ujjain faced problems due to the jam. With tears in their eyes, the angry relatives sat near the bodies of the two women refusing to move them. While the men spoke to the media persons and expressed their anger, the women folk were found consoling the family of the deceased.
 
 “The accident took place early morning around 6:00 am and even after three hours none of the senior police or administrative officials came to the spot. Only the SDM came and said that a compensation of Rs 25,000 will be given to the families of the women, who were killed,” said a protester Jeetu.
 
 The villagers were inconsolable and in a state of shock. “One of the women has a toddler. Who will take care of the baby now,” asked Kala Bai. The victims would earn Rs 100-150 per day.
 
 “If the chief minister speaks for development of the farmers he should also make sure that the families of the deceased get Rs 10 lakh compensation. One person from the family should also be given job by the government,” demanded another protester Rakhi.
 
 The protesters also went on a rampage and broke the windshields of four-wheelers. Mild force was used to disperse the crowd and forces were sent from Indore to tackle them.
 
 Police and administration managed to calm the crowd but it took several hours before the traffic could be cleared. The traffic from Ujjain to Indore was diverted to Dewas and the commuters had to take the long route to reach their destination.
 
 “I had to reach   for an important event and I started travelling from Ujjain at 8:30. I had thought I would reach in 45 minutes but it took me four hours to reach Indore,” said an anchor Revati Mahajan.
