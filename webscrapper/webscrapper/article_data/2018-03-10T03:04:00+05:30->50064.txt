Panaji: The transfer and sub-lease reforms ushered in by the Goa Industrial Development Corporation ( ) have already benefited industrial units whose promoters were pleasantly surprised to find their applications processed faster than usual. 

 Compared to the months that GIDC used to take to process applications, the deemed approval after 21 days is making things simpler and improving the ease of doing business, said GIDC managing director Narayan Gad. 
 
 “I am personally monitoring the applications that come in. Till date, we have received 15 applications for transfer of industrial plots and six applications for sub-lease of plots,” Gad said. 
 
 “Three applications for transfer of plots have already been approved along with two for sub-lease.”
 
 GIDC had notified the new transfer and sub-lease regulations, 2018, in February. 
 
 “There are some industrial units which have built-up space that are not being used, and if another company wants some space for storing raw materials or finished products, such a company can sub-lease the unutilized built-up area,” Gad said.
 
 To encourage more companies and to reduce the financial burden, GIDC has decided to charge the sub-lease fees on an annual basis instead of the entire term of the sub-lease, which could be five years or more.
