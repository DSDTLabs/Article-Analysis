Panaji: The state government shelled out Rs 17.37 crore for organising the 2016 edition of the International Film Festival of India (Iffi). The amount was Rs 4 crore more than what was spent by Goa to host   2015. 

 Officials documents show that the cost of hosting the film festival, for the public exchequer, has been steadily rising - from Rs 12.93 crore in 2014, to Rs 13.56 crore during the following year and Rs 17.37 crore last year.
 
 During the 2016 edition of Iffi, one of the highest amounts was spent for ‘technical support’, which included decor, housekeeping, security, electrical works and repairs to the buildings where the festival was hosted.
 
 In order to meet the costs, the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), the agency through which the state organises Iffi, tries to raise some of the amount by way of sponsorships. But the state government bears most of the costs involved in hosting Iffi, for which the central government’s directorate of film festivals only extends organizational support. 
 
 Sponsorships for Iffi mostly operate on the barter model, which is exchange of goods or services between the ESG and the sponsors. Companies provide technology, air tickets or manpower to the festival and get visibility at the festival in exchange for the services.
 
 Official documents state that all cultural programmes for Iffi were hosted through sponsorships and no amount was spent on this by the state. This has been stated in the reply submitted by chief minister Manohar Parrikar in the ongoing monsoon session of the legislative assembly.
 
 Festival organisers have come on record to state that prior to 2014, the cost of hosting Iffi was between Rs 10 to Rs 11 crore. 
 
 Goa has been hosting Iffi from 2004, before which the festival was a moving one where the host city would change each year.
 
 In 2015, Goa was made the permanent venue of the international film festival.
