AHMEDABAD: Former minister and writer   blamed the   for perfecting the caste system in India, among many other tools employed to divide Indian society, to continue to rule for over a century.

  During the launch of his book ‘An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India’, in which Tharoor has held the British responsible for not only plundering and looting India but taking false credit of introducing the subcontinent to modernity, the writer spoke elaborately on the divisive politics that former rulers employed.
 
 Apart from the Hindu-Muslim divide, Tharoor considered the British responsible for giving a final shape to the caste system. He said, “We had castes, we did not have the caste system. The British were the ones who had actually codified, entrenched and classified our country and our people in the way that we have since then started self-defining ourselves in ways that the British did for us.”
 
 He further said, “Caste had been much fuzzier, a much more fungible identity in the past. The whole notion of the   system being imposed as the only way India was supposed to be was because of the British looked at it that way. So the Brits in the entire process of trying to understand India, classified and codified things – it was a means for controlling India.”
 
 Insisting that his book is not meant for scholars, but for intelligent people who want to be acquainted with the argument of what the British did to India, Tharoor said that India is owed an apology form the British. When Germany can say sorry to Poland and Canada can do it to India for turning away a ship, the British must tender an apology for what they did at Jallianwala Bagh. “A member of the royal family or the present day prime minister of Britain should come at  , sit on his or her knees and say sorry at the centenary of the massacre,” he said.
