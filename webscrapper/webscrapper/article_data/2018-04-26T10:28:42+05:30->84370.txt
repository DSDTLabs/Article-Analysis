BHOPAL: As soon as Asaram was sentenced to life imprisonment, a clamour rose in Madhya Pradesh for renaming places named after him and dismantling signboards that carry his name.

 CM   was quick to take note when activists Rachna Dhingra and   voiced the demand. “Nothing is above Constitution, law and public sentiment in our country. This is the country where the name of   was changed. Appropriate action will soon be taken in this matter also,” the CM tweeted. 
 
 By evening, a signboard in   that said ‘Asaram Bapu bus-stop, Nagar Palik Nigam Bhopal’ was torn down by mayor Alok Sharma. 
 
 Dhingra, an activist working for rights of Bhopal gas-affected people, had tweeted in the morning and asked that names of roads, bus-stops and intersections named after Asaram Bapu be changed. Hunka tweeted on similar lines, urging the chief minster to “clear his stand”. 
 
 “It should have been done earlier but now, since the verdict is out, names of these places should be changed. The chief minister has replied, but the reply is non-committal. Moreover, what has Aurangzeb got to do with this road?” Dhingra told TOI. 
 
 The state unit of AAP has also demanded that places named after Asaram be changed. “Roads and squares are named after great people so that coming generations learn from it and adopt the values taught by them. Naming places by Asaram is like defaming our culture,” AAP state convener   said. 
 
 The bus-stop sign has been torn down. But there is a township in Baghmughalia, named Sant Asharam Nagar. Will it be renamed?
