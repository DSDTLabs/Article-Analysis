 Earlier, his lawyer had told the court Khan had arranged new surety and had got a solvency certificate that was valid till March 2. He had then sought extension of its validity. “On April 3, the solvency certificate was received, the applicant (Khan) was in Jodhpur since April 4. On April 10, he furnished the certificate before the court, and the same is pending before the police for verification,” the defence had said. On Saturday, Khan’s bodyguard   stood surety for him.
