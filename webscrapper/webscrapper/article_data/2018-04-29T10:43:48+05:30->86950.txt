BENGALURU: With the number of illegal private bus operators and maxicabs on the rise,   has seen a dip in its revenue. The garish, multi-coloured buses have also gained notoriety for reckless driving, shrill horns and heavy smoke emissions, thereby creating a menace on roads and giving motorists a hard time. 

  They operate primarily on routes where BMTC buses ply at a low frequency, including  ,  ,  ,  , Banashankari, Marathahalli, Kadugodi, Byappanahalli and KR Market. 
 
  BMTC officials said they have prepared a list of routes (see box) where these illegal buses are successful, adding that they are preferred by those working in the unorganised sector, especially those from the construction and garment industries. "We've been writing to the transport department, asking them to act against such buses and maxicab operators, but nothing has been done," a BMTC official said. 
 
  Sources say factors like low fares, greater frequency and easy availability of seats work in favour of private buses and that they are among the prime reasons for the corporation's revenue loss. The revenue dipped to Rs 1,770 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 1,994 crore the previous year, the source said.   could not share the figures for 2017-18. According to the rules, contract carriage buses are allowed to operate only between two particular points and should not operate as regular stage carriage buses like BMTC. However, these buses are operating as stage carriages between the permitted points and picking and dropping passengers in violation of the rules. 
 
  Regular inspections 
 
  J Jn anendra Kumar, joint commissioner, transport department, claimed they are regularly conducting inspections to rein in illegal bus operators.
