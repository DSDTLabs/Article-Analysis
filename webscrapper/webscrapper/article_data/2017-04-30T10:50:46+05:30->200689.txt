CHANDIGARH: Stepping up pressure for the construction of   (SYL) canal ahead of the   hearing on July 11, the Indian National Lok Dal ( ), opposition party in Haryana assembly, has warned that its workers will halt Punjab Roadways buses in Haryana on July 10. 

 Briefing reporters after the party’s state executive meeting here, INLD senior leader   said his party workers will also stop Punjab government vehicles entering Haryana on way to Delhi on that day. 
 
 The party, however, will adopt the ‘Gandhigiri’ way for private vehicles from the neighbouring state. The motorists will be handed over a rose and a copy of the memorandum containing INLD’s demands on the SYL issue. Chautala, however, made it clear that no ambulance will be stopped. 
 
 On being asked about their protest venue, Chautala said it would be either around Rajpura-Ambala border or on the   national highway-1.
