MARGAO:   collector, Anjali Sehrawat, has promulgated on order under Section   of the Code of Criminal Procedure, prohibiting gathering of four or more persons from 7am to 11am on January 26 outside the premises of Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex, South Goa collectorate,  , within a radius of 500m around it. 

 The prohibitive order has been imposed in view of the agitation planned by  , a collective of scheduled tribes, in front of the collectorate building from 9.15am onwards. 
 
 “...people from tribal community all over Goa are expected to participate in the agitation and are likely to protest against the government and the director of tribal welfare. There is every possibility that the agitating crowd may cause serious law and order situation and hamper the celebration of Republic Day at the Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex, thereby bringing disrepute to the state,” the order reads. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, the South Goa collector said that the apprehensions were based on “previous experiences” whereby such protests by tribal communities led to serious law and order situations.
