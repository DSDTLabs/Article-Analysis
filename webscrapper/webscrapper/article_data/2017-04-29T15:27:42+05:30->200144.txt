PUNE: The Exciting   Group, a volunteer group of scientists from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ( ) - National Chemical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, will organize workshops on “What Killed  ?” and “Earthquakes: Locating Epicentres and calculating magnitudes” on 
 respectively, for class 8-10 students.

 
 "Each workshop will be conducted in two batches of 30 students at IISER-Pune. The workshop on “Dinosaurs” is aimed to introduce participants to a significant mass extinction event in Earth’s history and examine the potential reasons for such a dramatic event including volcanism in India and the meteorite impact hypothesis," said an official release.
