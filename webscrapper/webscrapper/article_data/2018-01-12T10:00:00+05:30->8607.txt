There has been an ongoing debate within the healthcare forums whether it is low fat or low carbohydrate diets which are better for people with   and  .

 Recently a new research published by London Metropolitan University suggests that following a reduced carbohydrate diet can help to lower blood glucose levels, providing a safe and effective strategy for managing diabetes. Interestingly the participants in this study lost a median weight of 4.7 kgs over a period of 2 years as compared to 2.9 kgs lost over the same period by consuming a low fat diet. It was interesting to note that the lipoprotein profiles and triglycerides improved with low carbohydrate diet. 
 
 The data supports the common sense that if all carbohydrates convert into glucose in blood then the less we have them in our diet the better it is. Glucose metabolism is interesting. Improper glucose metabolism leads to ineffective fat storage. More fat storage leads to poor insulin function. The key to managing diabetes is probably in managing intake of carbohydrates. Further studies may be needed yet it seems like a plausible strategy! 
 
 Any treatment is difficult to become mainstay if the patient and the care givers are not involved in decision making. Hence, their inputs would be vital to making this a long term support modality for diabetics. This study presents strong evidence that lower consumption of carbohydrates may be the key to better management of diabetes. Therefore the mantra here is that if we have less glucose in blood, lesser would be its storage in our body as fat. Less body fat means better insulin function. Less is more here for sure....
