PATNA: After state transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala flagged off 15 non-AC buses on Gandhi Maidan-All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna route on Saturday, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal announced that the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation will introduce similar   service on Rajendra Nagar-Patna Sahib route within a month. Buses on this route will ply at an interval of 15 minutes. The BSRTC had earlier launched 25 non-AC buses on Gandhi Maidan-Danapur route.

 “We are conducting a survey to identify the stoppages on the new route and finalise the fares,” Agarwal said. 
 
 The transport department will also introduce a phone number to seek feedback from bus passengers. “A senior official will be assigned with the task of monitoring the feedbacks,” Agarwal said.
 
 The buses launched on Saturday will start from Kargil Chowk and pass through Dak Bungalow roundabout, Patna Junction R-Block, Old Secretariat, Chitkohra, Anisabad, Khoja Imli, Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Phulwarisharif Chowk and Walmi before reaching AIIMS-Patna.
 
 Three bus drivers and conductors also received monetary awards for their commendable services.
 
 Meanwhile, Union minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey has thanked CM Nitish Kumar and transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala for starting the bus service on Gandhi Maidan-AIIMS-Patna route. “Providing cheap public transport facilities to poor patients visiting AIIMS-Patna was the need of the hour,” Choubey said in a statement. He requested the state government to introduce similar bus services in far-flung areas as well.
