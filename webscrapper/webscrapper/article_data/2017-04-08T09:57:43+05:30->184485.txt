CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police on Friday   while four were on the run for   procured sand and gravel in trucks and tractor trolleys near Ludhiana.

 Seven FIRs were registered, the maximum in a day in a district so far, with charges of theft, obstructing officers and under the Minerals Act, 1957, by Ludhiana police.
 
 The mining was being done on the banks of the Sutlej near a regularized mining site at Meharban in Ludhiana.
 
 Ten trucks and six trolleys carrying sand and gravel worth Rs 3.8 lakh were seized. Of them, 7 trucks belonged to Sangrur and three are from Patiala.
 
 Among the accused, two brothers — Harmeet Singh and Harjit Singh — own the tractors and had been running the mafia for long. The brothers belong to Jodhewal in Ludhiana.
 
 The police are also trying to locate JCB machines that had been used in the past by this group for unauthorized mining.
 
 Checking illegal mining was one of the top agendas in the manifesto prepared by the Congress before assembly elections. Last Saturday, the prices of sand and gravel had spiked following a crackdown on illegal mining across the state, forcing the government to order auctioning of 59 more mines, beginning April 18.
 
 Chief minister   had directed the officials that a new transparent mining policy should be formulated within 30 days and asked them to submit its draft for a review.
