CHANDIGARH: An accused in   (judicial)   case, Sunita, has moved an application in a Chandigarh court, seeking video recording of the search conducted by the special investigation team (SIT) at the residence of Balwinder Kumar  , former registrar (recruitment) of the Punjab and Haryana high court.

 The application has been moved in the court of additional sessions judge J S Sidhu. The court has issued a notice to   and sought their reply by February 22. Sunita’s counsel argued that the SIT was not probing the case properly and the articles, which were seized from the residence of Sharma, were not produced in court. The counsel sought the recording of conversation between Sunita and Sushila, another accused in the case.
 
 It was also argued that since the SIT had mentioned in the chargesheet that Sunita had told Sushila on phone that she had the leaked paper of HSC (judicial) exam, then it must provide them the recording CD as well.
 
 Meanwhile, former HC registrar (recruitment) Sharma, in his bail application, argued that he had been made a scapegoat in the case and was falsely implicated. The court will decide on his application on February 15. Sharma’s counsel, advocate Ramesh Bamal, said the SIT failed to find any incriminating evidence against his client—any phone or audio recording or transaction. It was also argued that if SIT had any evidence, it should produce it.
