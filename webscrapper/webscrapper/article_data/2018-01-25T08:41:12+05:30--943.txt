HYDERABAD: Motorists can soon breathe easy as the state government has invited tenders for development, expansion and improvement of over 300-km length of roads in the state at an estimated cost of ₹2,400 crore.

 These roads include the crucial traffic-congestion easing projects in and around Greater Hyderabad like the much-needed construction of a flyover at ‘Che Number Junction’ near  . Another crucial project is the six-lanecum-semi-elevated corridor from Aramagarh to   airport road.
 
 Officials said the Central government has already sanctioned ₹338 crore for construction of 1.4 kilometre long flyover at the high vehicular traffic density corridor of ‘Che Number Chowrasta’ or 6 no. junction near Amberpet, which is part of National Highway 202.
 
 It will be a four lane flyover with service roads on either sides and is expected to provide much-needed relief to motorists from daily traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours.
 
 Among the other important projects for which tenders have already been invited are the six-lane road from Aramgarh to   International Airport on Hyderabad-Bengaluru National Highway and the   road.
 
 The construction of road from Aramgarh to Rajiv Gandhi International Airport is estimated to cost ₹283 crore and is aimed at providing seamless travel to commuters to the airport. The plan is to construct semi-elevated corridor at junctions between Aramgargh and airport road.
 
 The TRS government wants to complete these projects before 2019 polls. “Even if these projects are not completed, during poll campaign the TRS government will claim that the work on the projects is on and is on the verge of completion,” an official said.
