 ICICI Bank and its CEO Chanda Kochhar are facing the heat over reports that the Enforcement Directorate has started a probe into a Rs 3,250-crore loan sanctioned to Videocon group and others by the private lender. TOI had reported over the weekend that the CBI has started a preliminary inquiry into an alleged nexus between Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar.

 Earlier, the bank’s board had issued a statement reposing full faith in Chanda Kochhar while also stating that there was no conflict of interest or quid pro quo in the loan sanction process. The board also said that Chanda Kochhar was not the decision-taking authority and the bank had agreed to lend to Videocon following a credit committee meeting. Chanda Kochhar, while not a head of the committee, was part of it.
