 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a consumer outreach program conducted by TRAI here, Sharma said, “The issue raised now is only in  . We will have a study done of the issue and see how we will intervene.”
 
 “There are many issues like excess charges. We will have to study as to who is responsible for maintenance of set-top box. There are multiple issues in Tamil Nadu. We will study them and we will see what can be done in the interest of consumers. I can’t give a deadline. We will try to find a solution as soon as possible,” he said.
 
 He said the fourth phase of digitisation was complete in most parts of the country. “Tamil Nadu has some legal issues. That’s why the delay in completing digitization,” said Sharma. Many consumers had raised the issue of exorbitant charges being collected from them for availing the digital set-top box, at the outreach programme held in the city on Friday. 
 
 “Cable TV operators are demanding Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 for the set-top box which is supposed to be provided free-of-cost. If we oppose, we can’t get a connection. The number of channels is also restricted to very few,” said Shakuntala Srinivasan, a consumer activist. 
 
 The government scheme offers two packages - Rs Rs 125 for 200 channels and Rs 175 for 300 channels with 18 per cent GST. The set top box come with a Rs 200 activation and installation charges. At this point a cable-tv operator,  , raised concerns about the difficulties faced by them. “Whenever consumers fail to surrender the set-top box, we are liable to pay the amount of Rs 2,200 to the government as we have given an an undertaking to the government. In most of the cases, the consumers won’t return the box,” said Selvaraj.
