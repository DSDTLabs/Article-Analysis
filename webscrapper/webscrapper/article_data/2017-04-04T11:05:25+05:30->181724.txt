CHANDIGARH: The assassinations of top leaders of   in Punjab seems to be one of the biggest worries for   and the new   at the moment. This can be gauged from the fact that three alerts were issued by the Union home ministry and Punjab's own intelligence wing in March, barely two days after Capt Amarinder Singh was sworn in as chief minister of the state.

 The most recent alert, dated March 31, says, "A group of targeted killers is active in border range and is likely to target BJP/Hindu Shiv Sena leaders, RSS shakhas and some other VIPs in near future."
 
 The alert makes sharp observations in the killings of: Hindu leader Durga Das on April 23, 2016; Rashtriya Swayam Sewak vice-president V P Gagneja in Jalandhar on August 6, 2016; Hindu sect leader Amit Sharma on January 4, 2017; and one Satpal Sharma and his son in Khanna on February 2, 2017. 
 
 "All such incidents have taken place on a Saturday approximately between 6pm to 9pm," it observes.
 
 The alert further points out that the investigations in the four assassinations of 2016 revealed that stolen and snatched vehicles were used to carry out these acts of crimes, with two assailants in each case.
 
  "There have been at least two assailants who were motorcycle-borne in all the cases with muffled faces," he says.
 
 Sleuths in the Union home ministry say that the attackers in Punjab have been recceing their targets and may do the same again. 
 
 "During the recce, they might make use of police or Army uniform to conceal or disguise their identity or if in civvies, they might muffle their faces," it points out.
 
 Despite several attempts, neither Punjab Police chief DGP Suresh Arora nor ADGP (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta offered any comments. The alert though does not mention the killing of two Sirsa Dera sect followers in February this year as well as sensational assassination of Namdhari sect matriarchal head in 2016.
