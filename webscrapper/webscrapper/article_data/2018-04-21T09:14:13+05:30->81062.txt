FIAZABAD: A 10-year-boy who was abducted in Faizabad was rescued from an abandoned factory in   district of Haryana on Thursday. Four kidnappers were arrested.

 Dipanshu Chaudhry, a Class IV student, was going to school when his bus was stopped by the kidnappers on Tuesday morning. They told the bus driver that they were Dipanshu’s relatives and had come to take him to home as the child’s mother was seriously ill. The driver allowed them to take the boy.
 
 When Dipanshu did not return home from school, his parent informed the police. Six police teams were formed to find the boy. 
 
 Faizabad SSP   said that initial probe revealed that Dipanshu’s family had a land dispute with some persons in their ancestral village in Basti district.
 
 “Dipanshu’s grandfather Sitaram Varma was murdered in 2012. The accused in the case, Basant, belonged to the same same village. Basant is presently lodged in jail. The kidnapping was planned by Basant’s brother   to mount pressure on Dipanshu’s father   to withdraw case against Basant and give up claim in the disputed land,” SSP said.
 
 Police put the phones of Basant’s family members on surveillance. They soon got the leads that Dipanshu was held captive in an abandoned factory in Bahadurgarh where Anil used to work. 
 
 A raid was carried out at the factory on Thursday and the boy was rescued.
 
 Four kidnappers — Anil Varma, Vinod Kumar, Tribhuvan and Awadhesh — were arrested.
