Maitreya, who is going to play the lead in Mysskin’s next film is set to get married this year to Aparna   from the illustrious AVM family. The couple got engaged on Monday in Chennai. Speaking to us earlier in the day, Maitreya said, “Aparna is the daughter of MS Guhan and the granddaughter of AVM Saravanan. In addition to taking care of their studios productions, she also runs a foundation for haemophilia and cancer patients. We have known each for the past seven odd years. Ours is going to be a love marriage.” The wedding will take place in November this year, he added.

 Meanwhile, on the film front, even as he is waiting for Mysskin to complete his current project, Thupparivalan with Vishal, Maitreya has signed another film, which will go on floors later this month. “It is a horror film and will be directed by debutant Rajkumar, who has worked as an assistant under director Ram. Arumai Chandran, who made   sir’s son Luthfudeen as the lead in Parandhu Sella Vaa, is producing the film,” he revealed.
 His film with Mysskin, he informed, is likely to begin by September 2017.
