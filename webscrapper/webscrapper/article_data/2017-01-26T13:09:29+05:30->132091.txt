NAGPUR: Rahate Surgical Hospital on   has become the first hospital in the city and also in   to install a facility for the first-ever robotic laparoscopic surgeries for majority of specialized fields in medicine. The robot Da’ Vinci, costing Rs13.5 crore, will be used by six specialists’ doctors from different specialities at the hospital.

 The hospital has already successfully tried 10 surgeries, including cancer surgeries. The robot was procured by the hospital with the aim to establish a special   centre at its upcoming 200-bedded facility at  . The six storey facility will be called as Seven Star Hospital.
 
 Dr Prashant Jagnade, general and laparoscopic surgeon, told TOI, “The Da’Vinci Robotic Surgery System introduced in Nagpur after Mumbai is the most advanced and latest technique used worldwide to improve patient safety. It also drastically reduces the risk involved in many types of difficult operative procedures. A team of six doctors, including Dr Rahate, took training in Italy and other well-known robotic centres as a lot of training is needed to gain expertise for conducting the robotic laparoscopic surgeries.” 
 
 He added that robotic surgery assures a healthier post-operative life for someone suffering from severe life-threatening conditions and those requiring procedures like thoracoscopic surgery, kidney and prostate cancer surgeries, head and neck or ENT cancers, difficult gynaecological surgeries, bariatric surgeries, and surgeries for digestive, respiratory, urinary, reproductive and other vital body systems.
 
 Dr Rahate said that during a robotic surgery a very small incision (10-12mm) is made using the ‘trocars’ and then the robotic surgical arms are fitted with separate cannula. “The surgeon by sitting at his console uses gestures control. He also gets 3D images of the procedure at the eyespot located on his console. This makes the surgery more precise with least blood loss,” he said.
 
 He added that the cameras are powerful enough to give vivid images that can be enlarged 10 times to provide greater precision during procedures. The 3D view is much more accurate than the normal eye. Robotic arms are equipped with versatile surgical instruments and are designed to provide movement that is far superior to a human hand and can moderate movements of even a shaking hand.
 
 The endo-wrist movement gives surgical instruments seven degrees of freedom to give a range of motions greater than the human hand, the doctor further said. Additionally, the surgeon is able to use three instruments simultaneously, which makes this the most versatile and least time consuming form of surgery today. “Robotic surgery is all about better vision, precision and control, all designed to help a surgeon deliver better patient outcomes,” he said.
 
 The new hospital will have all major super specialities and all diagnostic facilities like CAT scan, MRI and radiotherapy equipment like linear accelerator with image guided treatment planning system.
 
 The team includes urologist Dr Sadashiv Bhole, ENT surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar, gynaecologist Dr Ashish Kubde, general surgeon Dr Zoeb Haider, physician and intensivist Dr Mohan Nerkar and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Ravi Dashputra.
 
 TECH TREATMENT
 
 ADVANTAGES
 
 · Very good tool for removing many cancers
 
 · Extremely precise surgery as it gives a 3D perception of the organ being operated upon and its surroundings
 
 · Other tissues are rarely touched as depth perception creates different surgical planes 
 
 · Investigative data is first fed into the computer to assist in surgical intervention
 
 DISADVANTAGES
 
 · Very high equipment cost which indirectly translates into higher treatment cost 
 
 · Each procedure requires use and throw instruments costing Rs75,000, which increases the procedure cost
