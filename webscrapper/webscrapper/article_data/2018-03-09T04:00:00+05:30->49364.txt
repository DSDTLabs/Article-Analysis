Vadodara: Two women lost ornaments worth Rs 1 lakh to conmen and chain snatchers between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning in different areas of the city.

 Sandhya Khanwilkar (62), resident of Salatwada, was returning home after meeting her sister-in-law in Alkapuri on Wednesday evening. When she reached near M K High School to catch an auto, two bike-borne robbers came near her and fled towards Baroda High School after snatching her gold chain worth Rs 60,000.
 
 On Thursday morning, when Savita Patel (81) was going to buy milk, two people showed her fake police ID cards and asked her to remove bangles worth Rs 50,000 after saying a man has been murdered nearby. Then, they diverted her attention and escaped with her bangles.
