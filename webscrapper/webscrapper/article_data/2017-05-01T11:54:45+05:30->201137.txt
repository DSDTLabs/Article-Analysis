PANAJI: Once calling it a ‘draconian move’ which was initiated without taking the stakeholders’ consent, the   ( ) toned down its stance on river   on Sunday. 

 Talking about the party’s current position on the plan to nationalize six Goan  , party spokesperson   said that their demands have been heard by Union minister for surface transport Nitin Gadkari.
 
 “We have reached a sort of compromise with the Union minister. During the NDA’s meet, Vijai Sardesai met Nitin Gadkari and informed him about the concerns regarding the livelihood of the fishermen. The Union minister assured that no harm would be done to their habitat and they would still be allowed to catch fish in their traditional manner,” Naik said, adding that they don’t mind dredging of rivers where it is a necessity.
 
 The party had conveyed its concerns regarding allowing fishermen in the rivers for their catch and their villages within 500m of the river banks which will fall under the centre’s jurisdiction. 
 
 “Most of the fishermen live near the banks. They cannot come from the forests daily and go to work. The Union minister has assured that these concerns will be taken care of,” Naik said.
 
 The party also shared its stand on the ongoing public debate over increasing coal handling from the Mormugao Port, stating that they support the move if coal is handled in a manner that doesn’t harm the environment. 
 
 “We demand that the coal should be handled in closed enclosures so that the dust pollution is mitigated. We are against open handling of coal and the process should be strictly monitored,” he said, adding that the people should give the government a chance as the resource is pivotal to Goa’s power demand. 
 
 “The state is getting its power from the western grid and the central grid. If we don’t allow our berths for the coal which is used by these grids, how can we ask for power from them,” Naik said.
