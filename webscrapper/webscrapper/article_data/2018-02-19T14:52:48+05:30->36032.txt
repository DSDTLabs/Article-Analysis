KRISHNAGIRI: A 62-year-old farmer killed a female leopard that attacked him and his cattle near Maharajakadai in   district on Sunday. 

 K   from   village said he had killed the wild animal in self-defence. However, forest department officials registered a case against him under sections of the Wildlife (protection) Act. 
 
 “I wanted to protect myself from the leopard. So I hacked it with a sickle,” Ramamurthy said. The officials said they are conducting an inquiry and will withdraw the case if it is confirmed that the farmer had killed the leopard in self-defence.
 
 Ramamurthy, who owns agricultural land near the forest border areas, rears cows for milk in his mango orchard. On Sunday morning, when he came to his farm to feed the cattle, he noticed a female leopard aged 3-4 years. The beast attacked a cow and he tried to chase it away with a wooden log. But the leopard attacked Ramamurthy causing minor injuries. To save himself, he attacked the leopard with a sickle. The animal suffered injuries on the mouth and face and died on the spot.
 
 The farmer informed his neighbours and they rushed to the spot. 
 
 Deepak S  , district forest officer, Krishnagiri forest division, and forest department field staff came to the spot and held an inquiry with Ramamurthy. They sent the carcass for autopsy. After the procedure, it was buried inside the reserve forest.
 
 Talking to TOI, forest veterinary surgeon A   said the leopard died of pain shock and severe blood loss due to the deep sickle cut. He said the farmer hacked the animal when it attacked him with its forelegs. The forelegs received deep cut injuries when he used the sickle,” he said. When the animal collapsed, he hacked the leopard’s head more than five times due to which it died on the spot.
