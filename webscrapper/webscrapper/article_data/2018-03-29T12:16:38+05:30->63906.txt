 During school days, Dhatarwal would walk four kilometres bare feet from his village to school. Our house had no light so he would study in the light of chimney, said his father Bholaram. In Barmer and Jaisalmer, the temperature during summers goes up to 50 degrees and it is very difficult to walk on sand.

However, Dhatarwal was determined to study even under such tough circumstances.

 His elder brother quit his studies and started working in a factory to support the family and continue Dhatarwalâ€™s studies.
