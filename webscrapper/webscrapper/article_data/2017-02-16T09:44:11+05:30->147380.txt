CHENNAI: The members of the syndicate of University of Madras want the vice-chancellor convenor committee re-constituted.

 Despite the issue not being on the agend, they raised the request on Wednesday during the   on the university campus chaired by school education secretary D Sabitha who now has additional charge of the higher education department as the secretary, A Karthik, is on leave.
 
 Some members told Sabitha that the vice-chancellor convenor committee did not have any professor from the university because of which hundreds of files relating to academic and administrative issues were pending. The committee has been discharging the functions of the vice-chancellor for more than a year since R Thandavan demitted office in since January 2016. Currently, the committee comprises Karthik, the director of collegiate education and Ajeet Prasad Jain, principal of a Chennai-based school.
 
 However, as the issue of re-constitution of the convener committee was not on the agenda for the meeting, Sabitha directed the syndicate members to meet her at the secretariat on Thursday, sources said.
 
 The members also raised the issue of registrar P David Jawahar sending an email to all heads of department in the university defending himself on the issue of transfer of money from a University Grants Commission (UGC)-mandated fund to building contractors. This too would be discussed in Thursday’s meeting, Sabitha said.
 
 The syndicate also resolved all the issues that are to be placed in the agenda for the academic council meet scheduled for February 25.
 
 Members belonging to rival associations said the syndicate meeting was conducted in a very professional manner and that all members were allowed to present their points of view. “Even the discussions which were not on the agenda were asked to be noted down and added in the minutes of the meeting,” one member said.
