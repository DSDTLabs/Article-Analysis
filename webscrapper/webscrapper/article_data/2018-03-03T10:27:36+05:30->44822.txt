The forest department has circulated pamphlets to create awareness among villagers who live on the fringes of the forests to prevent man-made fires. The department does not have advanced devices to tackle such fires. 

 "We still use   methods like green bushes and green branches of trees to tackle wild fires. Fire watchers and forest department field staff are working to prevent forest fires in all ranges in the Coimbatore forest division. As of now, we have three devices to control forest fires," said S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forests, Coimbatore circle. The forest department is yet to supply 15 such devices to each range. 
 
 When a forest fire is reported, field staff and fire watchers trek into the reserve forest and cut branches of green trees to douse it. The method is called beating the fire (beating burning foliage with green branches).
 
 M Senthilkumar, ranger,   forest range, said the department has been creating awareness among villagers who live in the forest ranges. "We request them not to take their cattle for grazing in the reserve forest and not to start a fire in the forest. People who possess patta land adjacent to the forest sometimes burn the vegetation near their land. The fire spreads and destroy the forest. This is a criminal offence and we will take stringent action against them," said Senthilkumar.
 
 He said the department field staff have been issuing handbills to the general public and requesting them not to cook food by the side of the road and not to throw cigarette stubs without put out the fire.
