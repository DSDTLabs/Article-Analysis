CHANDIGARH: Economists have red-flagged the Congress-ruled   government’s move to cut its capital expenditure — money spent on infrastructure development — for bringing down the state’s  , saying such a move could be lethal for any economy.

 
  
 Led by finance minister Manpreet Badal, the state government brought down its revenue deficit from Rs 7,982 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7,858 crore at the end of 2017-18 fiscal, showed figures. 
 
 However, this has come at a heavy cost, said economists. While the state government estimated its capital expenditure to be Rs 6,157 crore in the 2017-18 budget, it had only spent 40% of this amount, or Rs 2,500 crore, by March end.
 
 Eminent economist Prof Sucha Singh Gill said spending less on capital expenditure just to reduce revenue deficit was not good for any growing economy. “If you are cutting capital expenditure on agriculture sector, it is more disturbing,” he said.
 
 However, Gill said the state’s move to focus on less borrowings was a good sign for the economy. The state government, in its 2017-18 budget, said it would borrow Rs 23,092 crore. But it took on loan just 47% of the amount.
 
 The previous SAD-ruled government had spent 91% of its estimated capital expenditure by March last year. Latest financial figures reveal that neighbouring   has spent 78% (Rs 12,802 crore) of its Rs 16,288-crore estimate in the 2017-18 budget.
 
 Economists were of the collective view that the state’s finances hadbeen hit hard by the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) in July last year. 
 
 Economists said Punjab faltered in mobilizing its own resources to generate income and, so, got trapped in the vicious cycle of debt. They said this also increased the state’s financial dependence on the Centre.
 
 In its first year of governance, the   government in Punjab recovered just over 81% of revenue receipts against its target of Rs 60,079 crore. In this, Punjab’s sales tax collection fell short by Rs 15,656 crore, tax revenue collection by Rs 7,742 crore and land revenue by Rs 129 crore. 
 
 At the same time, the state government spent just 76% on revenue expenditure, against the target of Rs 74,864 crore. Areas where the state government performed well was collection of state taxes and duties, which increased by 153% against the estimated figure of Rs 16,334 crore. Recovery of loans and advances rose by 196% (Rs 156 crore).
 
 An economics professor at   in Patiala, Lakhwinder Singh, said the government was reducing its intervention in the economy by cutting do
 
 wn on capital expenditure. “This will actually derail Punjab’s economy. Till 1998, Punjab had the highest per capita income in the country. But we have been slipping ever since,” said Lakhwinder. He added the state could not expect investment from private players when it itself was pulling back.
 
 Capital expenditure had permanent growth effects on infrastructure development, employment and income generation, said economics professor   of the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Chandigarh.
