Chandigarh: Traffic jams in commercial and residential areas are becoming a headache for the residents of Sector 22 who struggle for a   space near their resident or near the market. Pointing fingers at the temporary arrangements made during festivals, the residents said that when the nearby school parking can be used for parking during festivals, it should be followed the whole year. 

 Area residents added every year the authorities gave a parking option not only in commercial but in residential areas also. Sharing their problems, residents said that traffic chaos has become a regular feature. Those with four-wheelers are facing the maximum heat. Besides traffic blockage has become a problem because of the narrow roads and the paver blocks where the residents fail to park their vehicles due to their height.
 
 Sushil Malhotra, general secretary, government houses resident welfare society sector 22 said that MC should set up parking space around the parks. He said that the number of vehicles is on a rise in the sector but the reduction of the parking space is creating traffic chaos.
 
 Ajay Gupta who stays behind the behind the mobile market said that even getting a parking space outside their own homes is a problem as commuters use the space. Even though majority of the residents have put up a notice not to park outside the gates but the commuters ignore it.
 
 In the dock:
 
 I would discuss the issue with the residents and find out a way to tackle the problem
