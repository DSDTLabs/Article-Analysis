PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said that electric buses, cars and scooters, besides ethanol- and bio-CNG buses would be visible on roads next year onwards.

 Addressing students at the convocation ceremony at the Dr DY Patil Vidyapeeth in Pimpri, Gadkari stated that the 7 lakh crore litre crude oil being imported into the country was affecting the economy. If electric buses are brought into play, it would be a relief of sorts, the minister explained.
 
 “While in London, I travelled in an electric bus in which the cost of the lithium iron battery was Rs55 lakh. Later, in a presentation, the   said that the same battery could cost around Rs5 lakh. The ministry has decided to commercialise its production. With electric buses, the passenger fare could reduce by half,” he said. 
 
 Pune-based Automotice Research Association of India (ARAI) and Central Institute of Road Transport are working on producing the lithium iron batteries. ARAI had also sampled an electric scooter a few months ago, he mentioned.
 
 The government has decided to produce second generation ethanol from biomass and an agreement has been inked with 15 industries. 
 
 Dr DY Patil Vidyapeeth conferred D Litt degrees on ISRO chairman AS Kiran Kumar, Avdhoot Shivanand of Shivyog Dham, and head of the Warana Cooperative Industrial and Educational Complex Kolhapur Vinay Kore.
