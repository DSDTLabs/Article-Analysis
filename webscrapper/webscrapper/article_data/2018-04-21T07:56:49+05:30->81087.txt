The first set of new air-conditioned buses might not hit the roads by May 31 as promised by transport minister M R Vijayabaskar.

 Prototypes manufactured in   and sent for Automobile Research Association of India’s ( ) approval were sent back since the design did not adhere to standards set by the Union road transport ministry As a result, manufacturing and building of bus — its body primarily — was temporarily halted. The process was resumed in full swing after last December, said an MTC official.
 
 Last year, Vijayabaskar had announced that 2,000 new buses for all the eight state-owned transport corporations will be procured. This included 100 air-conditioned buses for Chennai. Bodies for these vehicles are being built at 23 units maintained by the transport department.
 
 The Union transport ministry had earlier said all buses should adhere to the new bus body-building code (AS 052). The new code expects manufacturers to comply with parameters including floor levels, seat and steps design, fire safety, emergency exists and luggage rack. Accreditation from ARAI, confirming the same, is mandatory.
 
 “Prototypes of government buses manufactured in Tamil Nadu were sent back as they did not adhere to certain provisions mentioned in the new bus code,” said an MTC official. Following this, certain modifications were made to the design that delayed the process. The new buses will have fewer seats compared to the old vehicles. To compensate this, there will be more standing space for passengers, the official said.
