AMRITSAR: Taking strong exception to SAB TV’s serial ‘Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’ where one of the characters had appeared as Guru Gobind Singh, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has sought action against the channel.

 The committee has demanded withdrawal of the serial as well as registration of a case against the producer and directors for hurting religious sentiments of the Sikhs.
 
 Stating that the act of imitating the Sikh Guru was unpardonable, SGPC president Kirpal Singh   said no one had the right to play the role of the gurus. He said the incident of presenting an actor as a Sikh Guru had severely hurt religious sentiments of the community.
 
 “Earlier also this channel had shown disrespect to Sikh religious symbol kirpan, photograph of the Golden Temple and other Sikh traditions. Now it has shown disrespect to the Sikh Guru, which can’t be tolerated,” Badungar said.
 
 He said he had constituted a panel comprising SGPC general secretary  , SGPC executive committee members Surjit Singh Bhittewad and Ram Singh, SGPC member   and SGPC secretary Roop Singh to investigate the incident.
 
  “On receiving their report, we will take strict action against anyone found guilty of showing disrespect to the Sikh Gurus,” said Badungar.
