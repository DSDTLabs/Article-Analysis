LUCKNOW: When governors of all states meet President   next month,   Ram Naik's innovative idea on increasing  ' participation in polls will be one of many ideas up for discussion.

 The two-day conference on October 12-13 in Delhi, to be also attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other Union ministers, will see governors from across the country coming up with innovative ideas for discussion and exploring possibilities of replicating them in other states.
 
 Naik will present his novel idea of felicitating government officials on election duty whose polling booths recorded high turnout during the UP assembly elections earlier this year.
 
 This will be one of the ideas discussed. If approved by a majority , these ideas could be replicated in other states. Naik told TOI that he has come up with three ideas during his three-year tenure in the UP Raj Bhawan--felicitating government officials whose booths record high turnout of voters, convincing the state government to celebrate UP Diwas on January 24 as its founding day , and propagating the use of solar energy.
