KANPUR: The court has granted remand of former Mumbai-based cricketer  , his aides Vikas Chauhan and Ramesh Kumar, who were arrested for placing bets on   between   on May 10 at Landmark Hotel in the city. 

 "The three will be in police remand for nine hours on Sunday (May 21) for interrogation in connection with the betting racket," superintendent of police (east) Anurag Arya said.
 
 The police told TOI that during remand, the priority would be to get maximum information from the trio to crack the network of bookies. "On the basis of WhatsApp audio recording, Shah will be interrogated for his alleged association with two Gujarat Lions players, Ajmer-based bookie Bunty and Gujarat-based bookie Hanif, besides his local nexus. He will also be questioned why he booked a room in the hotel. He will also be questioned about his meeting with visitors at the reception of hotel, which came to light after examining the CCTV footages," a police official said.
 
 It might be noted that the WhatsApp audio recording in the mobile phone of Shah had led to startling revelation, where he was found telling Bunty Khandelwal about his nexus with two Gujarat Lions players.
 
 The arrested bookies were allegedly accepting the bets and also receiving calls from bookies in South Africa.
 
 The three were booked under Gambling Act and 129-B of the Indian Penal Code with Kotwali police. 
 
 The city police have raided Bunty Khandelwal and his relative's house in Ajmer on Sunday last. Bunty is yet to be arrested. The crime branch had questioned his wife Komal and his two other relatives in Ajmer. The police had issued lookout notice against him and the other bookie Hanif hailing from Gujarat.
