The music of director Mohit Suri’s 'Half Girlfriend' has been garnering appreciation ever since its release. The movie’s album features established names like Mithoon, Arijit Singh, Shreya Ghoshal, Rishi Rich, Ash King and Veronica, along with a few new singers.

 Even as the songs continue to fare well on popularity charts, the makers are going all out with a music concert today. The event, which starts at 6 pm at Phoenix Mills (Lower Parel), will have live performances by the film’s singers and its lead actors —   and  .
 
 Chetan Bhagat, the author of the novel on which the movie is based, says, “While ' ' brings back memories of first love, 'Phir Bhi Tumko Chahoonga' reinstates the concept of unconditional love. 'Thodi Der' makes you want to pause every moment spent together. Finally, the romantic melodies make way for the quirky 'Mere Dil Mein', which adds a different flavour to the whole album.” 
 
 Producer   adds, “Every song is integral to the narrative and takes the story forward. This film’s music is an experience that needs to be felt and with the concert, we’re bringing together all the artistes, who have made this journey possible. They’re going to burn the stage tonight.”
 
 'Half Girlfriend', produced by Balaji Motion Pictures,   and Chetan Bhagat, releases on May 19.
