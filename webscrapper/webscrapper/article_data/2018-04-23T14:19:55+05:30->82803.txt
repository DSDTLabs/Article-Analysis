Like any other industry, Tamil cinema has witnessed its own set of fan-wars. In 2015,   made headlines after he was allegedly attacked by   Haasan’s fans in Madurai. In fact, a video showing fans manhandling the star went viral on the internet. 

 Though the reason behind the attack was still unclear, reports suggested that fans manhandled Sivakarthikeyan as he was a die-hard Rajini fan.
 
 In a recent interview, the actor was asked about the alleged attack and what exactly the issue was with Kamal Haasan’s fans. Talking about the incident, Sivakarthikeyan stated that he had no idea why they reacted that way and also revealed that Kamal apologised to him later that day on behalf of his fans for their unruly behaviour. It must be noted that both stars were a part of the event when he was attacked.
 
 On the work front, Sivakarthikeyan awaits the release of ‘Seema Raja’, which is being directed by Ponram of ‘Varuthapadatha Valibar’ fame. Basking in the success of his last release ‘Velaikaran’, the star will also be teaming up with   for a sci-fi film later this year.
