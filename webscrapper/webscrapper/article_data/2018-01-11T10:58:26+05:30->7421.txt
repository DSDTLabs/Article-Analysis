HIRIYUR (CHITRADURGA DISTRICT): Seventy days into his Parivarthana Yatra,   and   B S   appears gung-ho about it. Between his rallies at Holalkere and Hiriyur, Yeddyurappa told TOI it’s his drive to prove the faith which national president Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi have placed in him to lead the BJP to victory which is giving him the much-needed adrenaline. 

 
 
 
 The seed of poison to divide communities was planted by chief minister Siddaramaiah and people are going out of control. The law and order situation has gone from bad to worse. Be it the murder of 22 Hindu activists or the Muslim who was killed a couple of days ago, people are fed up and are looking for change.
 
 
 
 The central leadership has taken a strong view of statements by Hegde and others and the leaders themselves have realised the harm they have caused to the party. In future, there will be a single voice from the party and this unity will help us move towards our goal. There’ll be no difference of opinion in future, even in selecting candidates.
 
 
 
 I’ve travelled over 8,500km and everywhere I go, there are at least 6,000 youngsters, apart from thousands who come to support the BJP. While I don’t know the situation in other states, in Karnataka there is strong support for Modi. Having addressed 1.5 crore people over these 70 days, I’m certain it’ll translate into votes for the BJP victory in the 2018  .
 
 
 
 
 Regardless of caste, people are with the BJP. Primarily due to Modi’s aura, the youth are attracted to the BJP. We believe they are the future.
 
 
 
 
 Neither. My biggest driving force is to prove the faith which both Shah and Modi have placed in me. Nowhere in the state has the BJP named its CM candidate in the last 19 elections. Karnataka is the exception. 
 
 
 
 Shah is a master strategist and his tactics have yielded results across all state assembly elections. The same strategy is being adopted in Karnataka and his suggestions will be implemented.
