LOS ANGELES: Drinking   during meetings can lead to a more focussed group discussion, boost involvement and leave members feeling better about everyone’s participation, according to scientists. The study was published in the ‘Journal of Psychopharmacology’.

 
 “If you look at where coffee’s being consumed, a significant amount happens in group settings,” said  , dean of the management school at the University of California, Davis in the  .
 
  conducted two experiments, each involving 70 undergraduates.
 
 In the first experiment, small groups had coffee together about 30 minutes before discussing an article. Other groups had their coffee after the discussion. Participants who had the coffee before rated their groups’ and their own performance more positively.
 
 In the second experiment, all the participants had a cup of coffee together before the discussions. However, some groups got caffeinated coffee, and others got decaffeinated coffee.
 
 The groups who had caffeinated coffee rated their own participation and their attitude toward group members more positively than those who had decaffeinated coffee. They also expressed a higher level of alertness.
