DEVADURGA/RAICHUR: Continuing his attack on Prime Minister  ,   president   on Monday touched on corruption and asked the PM to tell the nation how a firm owned by BJP national president   went from scratch to a turnover of Rs 80 crore in three months. 

 Seeking to turn the tables on Modi, who had called the Congress government in Karnataka a "10% commission sarkar", Rahul told a rally of tribals: "Modiji, when you talk of corruption, you (must) also talk about the business of Shah's son and explain how his company's turnover grew from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80 crore in just three months. You seem to have set up a very good startup for Shah's son while the country's youths are struggling to get jobs."
 
 "When you come to Karnataka next time, look at your leaders and you will find   and four of his cabinet ministers who went to jail on corruption charges. If you look further, you will find 11 more ministers who resigned on corruption charges. Yet you point fingers at our government which has fulfilled all the promises made to the people," he said amid loud cheers from the crowd.
 
 Making a jibe at the PM for always looking into the past, Rahul likened Modi to a cricketer who likes to bat looking at the wicketkeeper and gets out cheaply. The remark was reminiscent of the one about Modi driving while looking in the rear view mirror and causing "accidents" like demonetisation and GST. "Can any batsman look at the wicketkeeper and score runs?   would not have scored so many runs had he batted looking at the wicketkeeper and not at the bowler. I request you, Modiji, to look in front and bat," he exhorted Modi.
