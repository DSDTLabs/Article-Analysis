I am an example of someone who is surviving with only 25% of his liver functioning,” Bachchan said. “I am absolutely committed to the cause of hepatitis.

 WHO officials said that most people with hepatitis virus infection, be it hepatitis B or C, are unaware about it. These viruses get transmitted through infected blood, unsafe sex and sharing of needles. “Less than 10% of the people infected with the virus are aware of it. People have to be made aware about the need to test for this virus and undergo treatment,’’ said WHO South East Asia Region director Poonam Khetrapal Singh.
