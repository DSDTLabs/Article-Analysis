Nagpur: The security forces deployed in the Maoist-affected district of   managed to eliminate 19 rebel guerrillas during armed conflict at different places in 2017. Another 67   and their supporters were taken into custody while 22 rebels opted to return to the mainstream.

 The State Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell has issued a press release underlining the successes of the last year in which they had managed to leave the rebels in a tight corner with a comprehensive approach. 
 
 The Maoists further suffered a setback as 181 villages in Gadchiroli decided to adopt the ‘Gaonbandi’ scheme. The schemes helped villagers get special budget for development and other facilities for denying entry to the rebels and cutting off any supplies to them. The Maoists depend substantially on villages for logistics support but ‘Gaonbandi’ scheme dealt a blow to the rebels. 
 
 IG, ANO, Sharad Shelar attributed the success to the growing faith of masses on government and police machineries. “Schemes like Grambhet (village visit), Jan Jagaran Melawa and other civic programmes adopted by the police have had a far reaching effect in creating a bond between the masses and the security forces,” said Shelar.
