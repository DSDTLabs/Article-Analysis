Celebrating the superstar's dapper looks, we're taking a trip back to his statement-making styles from the past! Scroll through and check out all the trends introduced by Salman:

 
 
 
 Back in the 90s, Sallu sported long hair in his movie Chandra Mukhi. Making a cool hair trend with long hair, he surely set a trend for all his contemporaries back then.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Making leather jacket look cool since the 90s, we owe him the trend of the boxy leather jacket with patches. 
 
  
  
 
 If you think wearing torn jeans is a new trend, then you're all wrong. Salman has been working the trend since the 90s. Remember the Oh Oh Jane Jana... song? He stole everyone's heart with his shirtless swag and torn jeans.
 
  
  
 
 
 He even made a gajni a fashion back then. From wearing loose ganjis to wearing ganjis with denim, his fashion was surely ahead of time.
 
  
  
 
 
 When it comes to men's fashion, they hardly have accessories to style. Salman, on the other hand, made his firoza bracelet a huge trend for all the men out there. 
 
  
  
 
 
 Also, remember the one earring trend for men? We owe it all to Salman. He was one of the few actors who sported one silver hoop earring in Bollywood.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 He has been working the latest denim trend way before time. Sallu has flaunted everything from denim jackets to dungarees. 
 
  
  
 
 
 The star is famously known for taking off his shirts, but we love how he suits up in a quirky way. From sequins to velvet, he has pulled off every type of suit. Not to forget his muscular body that flatters everything he wears.
