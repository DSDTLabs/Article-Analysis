HYDERABAD: More than 300 trees that were marked for felling in different parts of Hyderabad and adjoining areas in order to facilitate road widening works and other infrastructural work have been translocated and planted at  , the Hyderabad centre of the   (SRCM) which offers the Heartfulness meditation system.

 While nearly 100 trees that had to be felled for the Thumkunta road widening project in Shamirpet mandal have found their way to Kanha Shantivanam, a sprawling 700-acre ashram nestled away in Chegur village more than 45 kilometres away from Hyderabad, close to 100 coconut trees that were marked for felling in   district of Tamil Nadu have also been translocated here.
 
 “Trees that have to be felled for road widening works or for other activities such as construction of a temple have been translocated and planted here. Since the trees were of 40-50 cm girth, they were ideal for translocation. Even 100 year-old Banyan trees have been successfully translocated and planted here. All the translocated trees are now returning to their former resplendent form,“ explained Dr  , coordinator of the `Green Kanha' initiative and a former IFS officer.
 
 While the broad roads of Kanha Shantivanam are already adorned with several rows of avenue trees, unique clusters of trees and dedicated gardens with themes like `Ruchi Van' (edible wild fruit garden) and ` Aayushya Van' (medicinally important tree species), it will house close to 50,000 trees once the campus is fully constructed. Incidentally, Shri Ram Chandra Mission, Kanha Shantivanam, was awarded the `Haritha Mitra' (Green Friend) Award by the Telangana government in 2016.
 
 Kanha, when completed in a year's time will house a world-class archive, cultural centre, a library and a museum all dedicated to narrating the history and current relevance of Yoga. The meditation hall will be able to house close to 50,000 people.
