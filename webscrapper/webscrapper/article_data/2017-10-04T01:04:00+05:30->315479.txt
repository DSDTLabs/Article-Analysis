 Madurai: Though the AIADMK government had promised to close down Tasmac shops in the state gradually, Tasmac’s revenue was more than last year’s, said the Tamil Nadu Federation of Anti Liquor Movements. They also reiterated their demand of implementing total   in the state.
 
 Many resolutions were passed in the conference of the movement held in Madurai on Monday. They said that reports stated that 3,321 Tasmac shops were closed in the year 2016-2017(till April 1 this year), but the revenue had increased compared to last year. While the revenue through Tasmac was Rs26,188 crore in the year 2015-2016, it was Rs26,995.25 crore for the year 2016-2017, which has raised the suspicion as to whether the shops were really closed.
 
 Though government claimed over 3,000 shops were closed, the number of persons consuming liquor was on the rise, hence the government had cheated the voters, the federation alleged. Tasmac’s revenue which had been Rs100 crore in the year 1983 had gone up to a whopping Rs26,995 crore by the year 2016-2017. Even young boys were found to be consuming liquor and Tamil Nadu stood third among states were people died due to liquor in India.
 
 Tamil Nadu also saw the highest number of accidents, with an average of 200 accidents taking place every day. Most of the accidents occurred when the drivers were under the influence of liquor. Violence against women was also on the rise, because an anti-people liquor policy was in place in Tamil Nadu for the past 42 years starting from the year 1972 they said. The meeting also resolved that liquor factories should be closed in the state and rehabilitation must be provided for persons who give up liquor. They also demanded that cases on people who had protested against liquor must be withdrawn.
 
 Convenor of the federation C J Rajan, Ramu Manivannan, head of the department of politics and public administration, University of Madras, V Karuthamma, Thensudar Women’s Movement in Theni district, state general secretary Janata Dal K John Moses among others spoke at the meeting.
