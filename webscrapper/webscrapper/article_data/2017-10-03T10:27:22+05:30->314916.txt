AHMEDABAD: With tougher prohibition laws in place, bootleggers have been coming up with novel ways to store or traffic liquor. While vehicles ranging from school vans to cash vans and water tankers have been seized ferrying liquor, storage has also become more varied. 

 On Monday, crime branch officials seized 667 beer cans and 74 litres of country liquor, worth Rs1.12 lakh in total, from an   storage site where a plastic drum was placed horizontally with one side cut open, about four feet below ground.
 
 Cops held a woman  ,  , who had created the underground storage in a compound adjacent to her house, which was used as a cowshed and an enclosure for tortoises.
 
 Inspector Kiran Chaudhary of crime branch said the plastic drums had been buried horizontally about four feet under ground with one side cut open. “They had dug a hole near the mouth of the barrel and had placed a stone on top of it. They would remove the stone and get to the barrel, to give liquor to customers,” added inspector Chaudhary.
 
 Crime branch officials said they have seized 667 cans of beer and about 74 litres of country made liquor, altogether worth Rs 1.12 lakh. “The liquor was hidden inside the drums,” added a crime branch source.
 
 Sharma is a widow and has been booked many times under prohibition laws. “She has been detained six times under the Prevention of Anti- Social Activities Act (PASA) and sent to jails in Jamnagar, Vadodara and Rajkot. Sharma came out of jail about two months ago,” added inspector Chaudhary.
