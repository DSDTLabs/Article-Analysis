MUMBAI: BEST on Thursday placed before the committee a proposal for a Rs4 hike in ordinary bus fares and Rs10 hike for AC bus fares for Mumbai.A 50-60% increase in monthly bus pass rates was also proposed. This was accompanied by a series of proposals, which included scrapping of AC buses, reducing subsidies for school students, freezing recruitment and cutting down staff allowances.

 Alarmed by the proposal, BEST Workers' Union declared an indefinite strike after March 20, if the plan to cut staff and salaries was not withdrawn.
 
 BEST committee chairman  , who is from Shiv Sena, did not take up the proposal for discussion. It will now be taken up at the next meeting. Sources said BEST general manager Jagdish   had called for a special meeting on Thursday, primarily to get the proposals cleared. “I leave it to the panel. My purpose is to undertake a series of measures to help curtail losses for the cash-strapped undertaking, and the proposals should be cleared at the earliest,“ Patil said after the meeting.
 
 In fact, BMC has promised a financial revival package to BEST if it adopts stringent measures, including wet-leasing buses, trimming staff and cutting down costs.
 
 “This is unacceptable,“ said   of BEST Workers' Union. “The decision to remove staff, freeze recruitment or cut down allowances cannot be taken without taking us in confidence, it is illegal. Buses will go off roads if the proposal is not withdrawn within a fortnight. We have given an offici al call for an indefinite strike,“ he told TOI. Patil said he will meet union leaders and appraise them of BEST's poor financial condition.
 
 It is unclear if BEST will be able to pay workers their salaries by April 10. Last month, it had to take loans from two banks to pay salaries for February.
 
 Patil said there was a plan to curtail 150 loss-making routes and rationalise them.
