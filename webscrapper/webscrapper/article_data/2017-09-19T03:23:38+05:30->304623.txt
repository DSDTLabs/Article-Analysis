NEW DELHI: A   has said that the need of the hour is to curb the growing   among people who value their views over someone else’s life. Observing that such instances reflected a return to “the age of barbarism”, the   sentenced four men to three years of rigorous imprisonment for grievously assaulting their neighbours, a man and his son in 2007 over an alleged political rivalry. 

 “The case depicts a glaring example of rising intolerance among the natives of this city who, even on trivial issues involving their alleged political faiths, do not even hesitate in attacking their own neighbours with such fury that even if the other side loses life, that would hardly matter to them,” said additional sessions judge Lokesh Kumar Sharma.
 
 According to the complaint, the convicts were allegedly workers of a politician back then. The four convicts — Vijay Kumar, Rishi Pal, a government servant, Ashok and Satbir — were sentenced to jail term for offences under Sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 325 (causing grave injuries) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC.
 
 The prosecution claimed that on August 4, 2007, the four men grievously injured Raju, who was their  , with an intention to kill him. Raju’s son Nilesh also got injured in the incident which took place in south Delhi’s Tughlakabad.
 
 The court also said that “Neighbours are considered more precious than relatives because in the event of any emergency, it is the neighbours upon whom a person could fall back for assistance and not on the distant relatives. However, with rise of materialistic society, somehow, we are deviating from our ancient culture, ethics and moralities and are returning to the age of barbarism as was prevalent in the primitive society.”
 
 In court’s view, the need of the hour is to curb such rising intolerance and to award a “suitable and adequate” punishment corresponding to the offence.
