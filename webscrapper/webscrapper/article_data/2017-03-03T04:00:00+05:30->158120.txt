CHENNAI: Renault India is ramping up its design capabilities in India in general and Tamil Nadu in particular. The company, which has two main design studios in Mumbai and Chennai currently has around 35 people (of them 20 are in Chennai alone) and is expected to grow that number to around 45-50 — up from 15 five years ago — soon which is the ‘critical mass’ in terms of headcount, said Patrick Lecharpy VP advanced design, head of Renault Design India studios. 

 These numbers are in sync with the French auto major’s head count in its other global design hubs. “We have around 15 people in South America, 50 in Korea and 45 in Romania,” said Lecharpy. But then, Korea also handles the China market and Romania handles Russia. “The strength of the design team is linked to growth of engineering activity in that market because the main aim of styling is to be close to engineering,” he said. Worldwide, Renault has around 500 members in its design-styling teams with the Paris centre boasting around 360 heads. “Our activities, including involvement in new model development, in India is part of the AMEI (Africa, Middle East, India) region,”Lecharpy added. 
 
 That design focus, he said, helped Renault build its successful small car KWID which is a good 30% lighter — and therefore more fuel efficient — than other cars in the category. “For the KWID we worked with a weight constraint,” he said . “Generally the A class entry segment is around 1000 kg but the KWID is under 700 kg.”
 
 Renault is also gearing up to nurture fresh talent in car design with the start of it’s first-ever Renault Design Academy in Chennai. The Design Academy will commence on April 3 and will operate out of the Renault Design Studio in Chennai, a new facility for developing new vehicles.
