BHOPAL: Election to the   was mired in controversy on Thursday with vice-president and president hurling accusations at each other. Voting for the society's top post is on January 8. 

 With less than 72 hours to go, society vice-president Gautam More called a press conference to level charges of financial irregularity against society president   and questioned his authority to contest the elections. "Yadav will be retiring by the end of the year. A society president is elected for five years. It means that if Yadav gets elected then he will be the president even after retirement," said More. 
 
 He alleged that Yadav wants to be president to "have control over the Rs 100 crore corpus of the Thrift Society". "Yadav's entire exercise is for that money," he alleged, adding: "He has been autocrat in his tenure. He never informed members of major financial transactions, like purchase of gifts. We want a president from the existing employees." 
 
 When TOI contacted Yadav for his comments, he levelled charges against More. "That I am allowing them to contest the elections is enough for him. I am the one who made it possible to make this society worth Rs 100 crore. When I was elected president of the society for the first time in 2007. it had only Rs 38 crore only," said Yadav. On the retirement issue, Yadav said, "I am contesting the elections as an existing employee. I do not think it is wrong." 
 
 Thrift Society in BHEL is responsible for disbursing in-house loans up to Rs 10 lakh to employees. It also controls important supplies for the canteen and other key facilities. This year, 46 candidates are contesting for 11 posts.
