AMRITSAR: Hearing in the bail application plea of suspended president of the Chief   (CKD)   in a sexual harassment case was adjourned till Thursday. Chadha was on interim bail till Wednesday.

 Police had registered a case against him and his late son   on the complaint of a women principal of a school being run under the management of the CKD after an objectionable video of Chadha with the said woman went viral on December 26, 2017. On January 3, Inderpreet committed suicide after shooting himself with his licensed weapon on the Amritsar airport road.
 
 Anandeshwar Gautam, counsel for complainant  , son of Inderpreet, informed that one of the alleged accused in the case of Inderpreet’s suicide, Manna, had withdrawn his anticipatory bail application. “Probably, he knew that prosecution has evidence against him and he may not get the anticipatory bail from court, so he preferred withdrawing his application,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, it is learnt that a special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the DGP under the chairmanship of IGP L K Yadav is recording the statements of persons whose names had figured in the FIR lodged by the Amritsar police.
