AHMEDABAD: It is painful to watch a tree being felled. The once waving branches are the first to be axed and, finally, the robust trunk that had taken 20 to 30 years to grow to that size, is mercilessly chopped down.

  It is painful if you imagine a human being in its place. As you read this, the   ( ) will be attending to 756 requests to chop down trees in the backyards of homes or from project sites. Road expansion, Metrorail, BRTS, drainage lines, footpaths, housing projects and even advertisement billboards have cost us our precious trees.
 
 It’s worth mentioning here that since the year 2010, when the first city tree census revealed that Ahmedabad city had 6.18 lakh trees, the city has lost some 5,840 trees to various multi-crore projects. The highest number felled was in 2015-16 when some 2,200 trees were chopped. 
 
 “Metrorail, road widening and laying of storm water drainage has led to a loss of trees in the city, especially in the south, new west and to some extent north zones,” a senior AMC official said.
 
  Between 2009 and 2012, some 34,737 trees were chopped in Ahmedabad district for development of state highways, industrial estates and mega residential settlements in the vicinity of the city. Gujarat forest minister Mangu Patel had stated in the state assembly that year that a total of 21,146 trees were chopped in the district in 2009-10. The following year (in 2010-11) some 9,785 trees were hacked and by the end of 2012 some additional 2,713 were lost to developmental projects. It is worth mentioning here that Ahmedabad and its vicinity have a rich population of trees. Of about 410 tree species in Gujarat state, over 200 species are present in urban Ahmedabad.
 
 This was revealed by forest minister Mangu Patel in the state assembly in 2009-10. Patel had also claimed that some 47.51 lakh saplings were planted against the trees chopped during the same year. 
 
 “What happened to these saplings and how many of them have survived is yet to be known. I have filed an RTI with the state forest department in this regard,” said an RTI activist from Sanand town, Devang Lakhani.
