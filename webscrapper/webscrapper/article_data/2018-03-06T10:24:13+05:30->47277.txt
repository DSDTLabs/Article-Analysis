NAGPUR: The   (NMC) on Monday informed that there is no threat to the 146 year-old dam on   lake due to ongoing work of Metro rail carried out by Maha Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL).

 NMC filed an affidavit in this regard after which hearing on the PIL was adjourned by a new division bench comprising justices   and Murlidhar Giratkar.
 
 The affidavit was in response to a PIL by   contending that MMRCL disregarded rules while constructing the station perilously close to the dam, which is posing threats to its structure. He pointed out that no construction can take place within 200m of a dam, as per rules.
 
 “The state should consult expert agencies before undertaking such projects which wasn’t done. NMC overlooked the report of the special agencies while granting permission for Metro work,” he said.
 
 On Thursday, MMRCL executive director  , through its counsel Kaustubh Devgade, filed an affidavit stating that there was no threat to the dam, as station is coming up on the elevated platform. MMRCL is taking every care for not causing any damage to the lake or dam,” he said.
