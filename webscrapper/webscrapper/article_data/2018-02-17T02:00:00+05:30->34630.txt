New Delhi: “Are you prepared for your exam or are you a bit nervous?” one of the participants asked Prime Minister at the “Pariksa Par Charcha” conversation he had on Friday with students preparing for examinations. 

 The student’s reference was to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as the big test awaiting Modi and the PM responded to the questioner saying that if one worked hard, the results will come too and added that he spent his energies working for the welfare of 125 crore Indians.
 
 The question from the Class XI student and the PM’s response highlighted the rare interaction where Modi played counsellor, advising the attendees not to be awed by the challenge of boards and how to fight exam stress. He urged them to see him as a friend and not a political leader.
 
 To the student who posed the exam question, he said, “If I was your teacher, I would’ve guided you to take up journalism -kyun ki aise lapet ke sawaal journalists hi puchte hain” and added: “Exam, result and marks should be a by-product. You have done your work, the result will come. If you go by marks, you may not achieve what we really want ... I work on the same principle in politics. All my time, energy and strength and mental capability, all is spent on 125 crore Indians.”
 
 Sounding like an avuncular family elder, Modi gave the example of the Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris, who won a bronze medal in the ongoing Winter Olympic Games despite the fact that he was in a coma just eleven months prior to the tournament, and BJP’s rise to prominence after a long spell on the margins.
 
 “Elections come and go, they are like by-products,” the PM said, noting that he looked for the best wishes of “125 crore Indians”. He interacted with students from across the country at “Pariksha Par Charcha” held in Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium to discuss how to make exams stress-free.
