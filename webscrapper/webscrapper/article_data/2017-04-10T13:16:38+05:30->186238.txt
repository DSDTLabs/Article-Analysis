After the success of 'Baahubali', director Rajamouli has become a name to reckon with in Indian cinema. Though the director has many films to his credit, that talk about his talent and success rate, it is only 'Baahubali' that catapulted him to international fame.

 Recently, at the audio release event of the most anticipated movie of the year, 'Baahubali: The Conclusion' held at Chennai, the team of Baahubali were seen interacting with media in a way that was never like before. Among one such interactions, the Tollywood's dear 'Jakkanna' revealed his desire to work with Superstar Rajinikanth, as an answer to the question about whom he wishes to work with in Tamil cinema.
 
 The answer not only made the Tamil media and film fraternity happy, but also movie buffs across the country. Who wouldn't want to watch a film that has Superstar Rajnikanth, directed by Rajamouli?
 
 It is worth mentioning that, during the audio release event of Rajinikanth's 'Kochadaiiyaan', where Rajamouli was present too, Rajinikanth heaped praises on the director and said that one day, he would like to work with Rajamouli.
 
 So, may be, there is going to be something interesting that comes our way in a couple of years from the two biggies of south cinema. Let us wait and watch.
