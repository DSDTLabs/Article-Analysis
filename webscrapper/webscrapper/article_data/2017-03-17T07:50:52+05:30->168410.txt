JABALPUR:   High Court on Wednesday dismissed a PIL demanding registration of case against chief minister   under provisions of Arms Act. 

 A Sikh charged under the Arms Act for allegedly keeping a sword in place of a 'kripan' had moved the court claiming that Chouhan too was liable for a similar case since he was gifted a sword during a religious ceremony held in   on January 5.
 
 Petitioner Ajit Singh alias Mange Sardar of Jabalpur had also written to the director general of police that in Madhya Pradesh, only Sikhs are allowed to keep weapons between 6 inches and 9 inches long. 
 
 The law says that any blade longer than 9 inches will be considered a weapon even if a Sikh carries it. But Sikh religious leaders have gifted chouhan a sword that is longer than 9 inches. In his January 17 complaint, he has submitted a copy of the   of the chief minister where he is seen accepting the sword.
