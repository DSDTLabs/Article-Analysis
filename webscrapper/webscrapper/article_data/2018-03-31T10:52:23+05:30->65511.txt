MANGALURU: People with a sweet tooth, gleefully munching on a variety of snacks from their favourite bakeries, were in for a shock when video footage of the appalling condition of a   went viral.

 On Wednesday, Shashidhar  , state secretary, National Environment Care Federation, stumbled on water leakage from a toilet in a multi-storeyed building. He wanted to find out where the water was being collected. To his dismay, he realised that the water was getting accumulated near the kitchen of a popular bakery. The video shows food kept uncovered in this tiny shed.
 
 Shetty entered the kitchen and filmed the   of the kitchen. The video shows dyes, used in garment factories, and grease used to make the snacks look colourful and attractive. The video garnered over 5,000 shares and 1.3 lakh views in 48 hours on a social networking site.
 
 Shetty alleged the situation is similar in several bakeries and eateries across the city. Despite being apprised of the situation, government officials seemed reluctant to address the issue.
 
 After two days, when they finally visited the kitchen on Friday, the shopkeepers had shifted their commodities out and left no evidence there. It appears they may have vacated the kitchen after seeing the video clip. “The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is a sham,” Shetty said.
 
 Dr  , health officer,  , said he had acted on Shashidhar’s verbal complaint. However, he could not take immediate action as he didn’t know the exact location of the kitchen.
 
 “I visited the kitchen along with food and safety officer and others. They had cleaned the kitchen and shifted all the items out. We have taken samples of food items which we will send to a food laboratory in Mysuru. The report may be ready in 15 days. We have locked the kitchen,” Dr Shetty said.
