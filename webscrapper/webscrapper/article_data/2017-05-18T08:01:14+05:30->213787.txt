KANNUR: Union minister of state for  ,   said on Wednesday that it was the duty of the state government to protect every citizen and maintain law and order. He added that if the state wanted any help to restore peace in the district, the Centre was ready to aid the process. 

 Addressing the media after visiting the family of RSS worker   - who was hacked to death near Ramanthali on May 12 - he said Biju's murder was premeditated. "He had been facing murder threats for quite some time because he was named an accused in another murder case under IPC Section 120B for conspiracy," said the minister, who asserted that the people and party would stand by Biju's family.
 
 "He was involved in a case at some point of time and it does not vindicate his killing," Rudy said.
 
  When he was asked about the  's demand to impose the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in the district, he said the idea was to get justice and protection for party workers. "Whatever may be the terminology or whatever may be the understanding or whatever may be the demand of the party, the aim is to see that the people who were responsible for such acts are punished," he said, playing down the demand for AFSPA.
