HYDERABAD: At the time when   is going for bonds to raise funds, the state government has come under sharp criticism for not allotting enough  . Experts alleged that the civic body is deprived of income from its taxes. 

 Retired IFS official, Padmanabha Reddy, of Forum for   told TOI, "We filed   regarding budget allocations and taxes of GHMC. Hyderabad has 25% of state population and generating about 60% of state's income. The share of GHMC in Motor Vehicle Tax, Professional tax, etc. collected by the state government is not being passed on to the civic body. GHMC, which was in the surplus budget just three years back has now gone back to a deficit budget. Taxes paid by Hyderabad residents are used for other purposes by the government. Currently, GHMC is running after lending agencies to seek loans for plan works. If the government releases the funds due to GHMC as provided in article 243 - X of Constitution, there won't be any need for taking loans." 
 
 During the year 2015-16, non-plan releases from the government to GHMC are just 50% of budget provision. As against 80.90 crore of budget estimates only 40.48 crore were released. In the year 2016-17 as against the budget provision of 68.42 crore, no amount was released. "GHMC Commissioner had requested the government for release of funds in January 2017. But in April, the government refused to state that financial year is closed," said Padmanabha Reddy. 
 
 For year 2017-18, as against budget provision of 62.21 crore, only 9.33 crore were released (as on 15-11-2017). "For plan works as against the budget estimate of 816.91 crores, no amount was released. Rough estimate put it that out 1.50 lakh crores of annual state budgets, GHMC should get anything up to 10,000 crore," added Reddy.
