GHAZIABAD: Traffic chaos continued unabated on the main road in front of the district collectorate on Tuesday, as candidates arrived to file their nominations on the last day of the   process. Hundreds of supporters accompanying the various candidates gave a tough time to commuters on the Hapur Road stretch in front of the collectorate.

 The jams were sporadic and kept recurring whenever candidates arrived with processions of supporters at the main gate of the collectorate. However, traffic crawled at a snail’s pace between the RDC flyover and the cut at Ingraham Institute throughout the day.
 
 Police personnel posted on the stretch had a tough time managing the crowd. Supporters parked their vehicles on either side of the road, obstructing traffic movement. They blocked vehicular movement while jaywalking across the road towards the collectorate’s gates.
 
 The traffic congestion on Tuesday was, however, less compared to the day before.
 
 A total number of 89 candidates have filed nominations for the five constituencies of Ghaziabad. Sahibabad has received the maximum number of nomination papers so far, with a total of 29 candidates. From Loni, 11 candidates have submitted their nominations, while Muradnagar has received nomination papers of 17 candidates.
 
  Election officials have received 20 nomination forms for Gaziabad and 12 forms for Modinagar.
