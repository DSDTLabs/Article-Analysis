 now a global sensation with her stunning performance in ‘Quantico’ where she plays Alex Parrish donned a black figure-hugging gown with a deep neckline at the   after party.

 
 
 PeeCee looked ravishing in her attire and right after the tiresome evening she grabbed a relish-worthy burger for dinner.
 
 She took to Instagram, to share a picture of her with a juicy burger in her hand with the caption, “And it's over! #oscarweekend !! my treat. #innout”
 
  
  
 She did deserve this treat after all she was a treat to watch herself at the Oscar and Post Oscar galas.
