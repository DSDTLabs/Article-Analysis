BARNALA: Aiming to provide benefits of governance reforms, the   district administration on Thursday launched free Wi-Fi service for all those visiting the district administrative complex (DAC). The district administration a few months ago had signed a formal agreement with   (RJIL) to provide Wi-Fi internet facility totally free of cost.

 Barnala deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said anybody visiting the DAC would be able to use 1GB of internet data daily at a high speed of 10 mbps. The Wi-Fi routers have been installed in different areas of the complex.
 
 Thori said to avail free Wi-Fi internet, one would have to simply turn on his Wi-Fi on the mobile phone/laptop/computer. Once the Wi-Fi is turned on, the user would have to connect to ‘JioNet’. Once connected, one would have to submit mobile phone number on which one time password (OTP) would be sent. When the OTP is submitted, the user would have access to 1 GB of free internet daily.
