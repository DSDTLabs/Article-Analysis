Tina is about to fall from the swing when Thapki runs and catches her. Bihaan also comes running and holds them. Shraddha then tells Thapki that she seems to be fine now and should leave their house now.
 
  Dhruv agrees with her too and asks her to leave. Bihaan asks Thapki to stay till his marriage with Sankara.
  
  Shraddha and Sankara fume with anger and think that their plan is backfiring.
  
  Bihaan is sitting outside alone when Dhruv comes in. Dhruv asks Bihaan if he is happy with his marriage with Sankara and he should tell him if he doesn't want to get married. Bihaan thinks of Thapki and can't stop it.
  
  Shraddha sees doctor's assistant in their house and asks him the reason he's here. He tells her that she only called him for Bihaan's fake medicines.
  
  Thapki then comes in and Shraddha realises that all this was recorded by Thapki. Shraddha is shocked. Thapki tells her that she will blackmail her just like Shraddha did.
  
  Thapki asks Shraddha to give her the letter and take back the recording. Shraddha gives the letter to Thapki.
