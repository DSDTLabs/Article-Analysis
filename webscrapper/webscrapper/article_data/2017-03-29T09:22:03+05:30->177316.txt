PATNA: More than 5,000 home guard jawans were arrested on Tuesday when they tried to move towards the legislative assembly demanding equal pay for equal work. The assembly was in session. The area is a prohibited zone. They were kept inside the   at Gardanibagh till going to press.
 
  Around 72,000 home guards have been on indefinite strike since March 15, adversely affecting the security arrangements at different government establishments and banks. Even the traffic management on roads in several cities and towns has been hit hard due to their strike.
  
  ADM (law and order)   said more than 15,000 homes guards had gathered at Gardanibagh on Tuesday morning and marched towards the assembly. “Being a prohibited area, they were not allowed to move beyond Chitkohra roundabout. Around 5,000 of them were taken into custody,” he said, adding that their protest resulted in traffic jam in the area for several hours.
  
  Bihar   general secretary   said their indefinite strike would continue until the state government accepts their demand, which is based on a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that home guards should get remuneration equal to police personnel while on duty.
  
  “We had several rounds of meetings with principal secretary (home department) Amir Subhani, DGP P K Thakur and DG (home guard) PN Rai, but to no avail,” Prasad said, adding that until the government assures them in writing, they won’t call off their strike. He also accused the government of threatening them to call off their strike. Prasad said the state machinery was used in many districts to stop the home guards’ buses from reaching Patna.
  
  Meanwhile, RJD vice-president   met them at Gardanibagh on Tuesday and supported their demand. “The demand of the home guard jawans is justified and as per law. The state government should accept their demand,” Singh said.
