CHENNAI: Two days after a 45-year-old government employee, detained for assaulting his neighbour, died in custody of the Chunambedu police in Kancheepuram, his wife Vennila on Friday approached the Madras   to seek a   inquiry into her husband’s death.

 A vacation bench is likely to hear the plea next week.
 
 Police said Sitrarasu, a junior assistant in the education department, hanged himself with his underwear in a washroom in the Chunambedu   during a blackout in the locality, and that they found him dead know after the electricity board restored the power supply around 4.30am.
 
 However, alleging that her husband was beaten to death by policemen in the station, Vennila has approached the court seeking CB-CID probe and to permit her to have a doctor of her choice present during her husband’s autopsy.
