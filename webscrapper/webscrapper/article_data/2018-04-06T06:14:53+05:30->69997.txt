CHENNAI: After a gap of nearly two years, Anna University finally got a vicechancellor on Thursday. Former director of IIT-Ropar, M  , was appointed vicechancellor of the university for a period of three years by governor Banwarilal Purohit. The university has remained headless after the exit of former VC Rajaram in May 2016.

 Surappa, a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, was director of IIT-Ropar from 2009 to 2015. A doctorate in metallurgical engineering, he has more than 30 years of teaching experience of which 24 years were spent in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, a statement issued by Raj Bhavan said.
 
 A fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering, Surappa has 150 research publications and four patents to his credit. He was also secretary, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology from 2004 to 2009.
 
 Surappa’s appointment comes after three search committees were constituted to nominate potential candidates for the VC’s post. Former   judge   was appointed chairperson of the third search committee toward the end of last year.
 
 
 
 
 A notification sent out over a week ago had extended the term of the VC search panel till April 30 from the original March 31 deadline. The committee had ex-IAS officer N Sundaradevan as the government nominee and IIT-Madras professor   as Anna University syndicate’s nominee.
 
 Two search committees formed earlier were unable to appoint a suitable candidate to the VC post and previously shortlisted candidates were rejected. Academicans said such a long gap between appointments could be avoided, especially with a university that is known as a nodal centre for engineering admissions. Former VCs of the varsity including M Anandakrishnan and E   opined that search committees must be set up much before the VC’s term ends. The new VC is stepping in as the varsity is gearing up to carry out the single window counselling for engineering admissions which has gone online for the first time.
