Gurgaon: A 220kV   along NH-8 near Badshapur went up in flames on Tuesday morning, triggering power outage in the area.

 Sparks in the loose wires led to the explosion around 8.30am, officials of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) said. Around 40 households in Badshapur bore the brunt of the outage that lasted for around eight hours.
 
 “I heard a small explosion before the transformer blew up in flames. A huge fire broke out,” Karan, an eyewitness, said.
 
 However, some officials brushed it off as a “minor incident”. “We did not have to change the transformer. We just repaired this,” an official said. They added that the transformer was repaired and resumed the power supply by around 4 pm.
 
 “The transformer caught fire triggered by sparking and all the 11 Kv feeder lines burned along,” said Sunil Sainy, who is a junior engineer with DHBVN. He also said one of 66 kV substation feeder lines coming off Badshapur is linked to the transformer. However, locals said they had been observing oil leakage in the transformer for several days.
