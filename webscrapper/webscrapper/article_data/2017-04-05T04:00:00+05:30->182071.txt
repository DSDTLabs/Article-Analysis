Bharuch: Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative Yasin Bhatkal, the mastermind of serial blasts in Ahmedabad in 2008, who was recently sentenced to death for the 2013 Dilsukhnagar blasts in Hyderabad, was brought to Bharuch on Tuesday for site verification relating to terror cases registered in Gujarat. Ahmedabad crime branch sleuths took Yasin Bhatkal under tight security to a bungalow in Sherpura area of Bharuch where he had spent a day on July 18, 2008. A panchnama was done at the spot and then he was taken to Bharuch police headquarters.  Sajid Mansuri, one of the accused who had planted bombs in Surat on the instructions of Bhatkal, was arrested from Lukman Park of Bharuch in 2008. Sajid, responsible for transhipping and keeping a watch on a car that had live bomb at Dahej bypass, spilled the beans on Bhatkal’s role, sources said.  Bhatkal was arrested in 2013 from Indo-Nepal border and is presently lodged in Cherlapally Central Prison in Hyderabad. He was recently brought to Ahmedabad on a transfer warrant from Hyderabad. Bharuch district superintendent of police Sandip Singh told reporters, “We extended support to crime branch sleuths from Ahmedabad who brought the accused to Bharuch for investigating the serial blasts case.”
