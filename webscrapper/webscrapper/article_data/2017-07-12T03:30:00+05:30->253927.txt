Panaji: Town and country planning (TCP) minister and Goa Forward Party (GFP) mentor Vijay Sardesai on Tuesday demanded that cases regarding vandalism of religious structures be transferred to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the Goa Police and not to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Calangute BJP MLA and deputy speaker Michael Lobo had on Monday demanded that such cases be handed over to the CBI for further investigation.  “I think the CBI will take this issue to a dead end. The local police force should either be pushed a little more or the cases should be handed over to the ATS,” Sardesai said.  The TCP minister, who was speaking to reporters after BJP’s Rajya Sabha candidate Vinay Tendulkar filed his nomination papers at the Goa legislative assembly, termed the desecrations as “an act of terror with the specific intention to create disharmony in society”.  He also said if the police found a person desecrating religious structures, they should shoot him down. “If you see a terrorist, you will not send a warrant but will take action. The same action should be taken against those who vandalise religious structures,” he said. When asked why he was not on the same page as Lobo regarding the agency that could further probe the cases, Sardesai said, “Lobo is a bit more excited; he has been more hurt and has made it clear that the CBI is the solution to all problems. I disagree with him. When we hand over cases to the CBI, it means we don’t have faith in our police.”
