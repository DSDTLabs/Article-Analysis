AURANGABAD: Two-month old  ,  , all three   were given their names in a simple ceremony on Thursday. 

 Visitor, however, still have to wait two more months before authorities feel it is safe to be near the mother and her cubs. “The big cats don’t like human interference at this stage. And there is also the chance that the   may get an infection so they must be kept isolated,” Sanjay Nandan, the supervisor of the zoo told TOI.
 
 Mayor Bapu Ghadamode, standing committee chairmen Mohan Meghawale, opposition leader in the civic body Ayub Jahagirdar; leader of the house Gajanan Mangate and others unanimously decided on the names of the cubs. All the tigers and leopards in the zoo are given specific names so that they have a unique identity. The name of the animals outside its cage so visitors and see and recognise them. This helps the caretakers, zoo authorities and the public make an emotional bond with the animals.
 
 On November 12, a tigress gave birth to four cubs in the zoo but one of them was found dead at birth. Out of the surviving three cubs, two male and one female, a cub is white in colour. 
 
 White tigers are considered rare and the zoo expects that the cub will help attract more visitors to the zoo. This was the first time a white tiger was born in the zoo. The zoo does have a full-grown white tiger but that rare big cat was brought in from another location. 
 
 With the birth of these three cubs, the number of tigers in the zoo has touched nine.
