Great grand-daughter of legendary film and television director Dr Ramanand Sagar, the 19-year-old has trained professionally for eight years at the  . In an interview with,   and her mother, producer  , they talk about her journey as a teen singer:

 
 
 
  Sakshi wanted to be a singer since the age of eight. I was impressed with her focus and encouraged her to work towards her dream. 
 
  That’s true (laughs). While most parents I knew were telling their children to concentrate on their studies, my mom told me to focus on my singing. She was very strict when it came to my vocal training.
 
 It’s been Sakshi’s own hard work and determination that has brought her to this point. She used to practise day and night before her vocal exams. That focus has not changed one bit since in the past 11 years. 
 
 
 
 
 Being a single parent, my mom always taught me one thing — no matter what, a woman should always stand on her own feet. My career is the most important thing in my life, but only after my mother!
 
 
 
 
  Many a times, I find my strength in my rebellious little girl. 
 
  And I find mine in hers. It’s her birthday today... and I want to thank her for everything.
