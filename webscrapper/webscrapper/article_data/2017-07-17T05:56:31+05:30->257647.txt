NEW DELHI: Create a law-abiding culture, Delhi high court has said while cautioning the Centre and AAP government against issuance of pollution under control ( ) certificates to polluting vehicles in the city.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C   also expressed concern over the agencies failure to conduct “random check“ on vehicular pollution in Delhi.
 
 The bench said that it does not want any “special drive“ to enforce pollution control rules for motor vehicles.
 
 “We should strictly abide by the rules. We do not want a special drive,“ the bench said, adding that “random check is only done during a special drive of vehicle rationing“.
 
 “Create a culture that one should abide by the law,“ it added.
 
 “The petitioner makes a serious complaint with regard to the vehicular pollution in Delhi as well as in the manner in which the certificates of compliance are issued. It is obvious that the same can be effectively regulated and ensured if the random checks were conducted in Delhi,“ the bench said.
 
 Additional Delhi government standing counsel   said that “effective steps in this regard shall be commenced at the earliest“.
 
 The court was hearing a plea by NGO 'Campaign for People Participation in Development Planning', which alleges that the rise in vehicle-generated air pollution in Delhi was due to “non-enforcement and non-implementation“ of the 1988 Motor Vehicle Act, which prescribes punishment for driving a polluting vehicle.
 
 The NGO's counsel   claimed that pollution tests carried out at the checking centres were a “sham“ and the PUC certificates were being “casually issued“ with the knowledge of the government and its agencies.
