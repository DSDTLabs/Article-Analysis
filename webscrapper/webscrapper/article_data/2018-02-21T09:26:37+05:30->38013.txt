CHANDIGARH: Class XII students of   (CISCE) described their 70-mark   as theoretical but easy. 

 "The paper was a little theoretical this time. It had more definitions and conceptual questions this year. Otherwise, it was easy," said Madhur, a Class XII student. Teachers also said the paper was not very difficult.
 
 "The paper had a balance between straight forward and conceptual questions. Numericals were simple and formula-based. Students might have found two questions, 9 (ii) and 10, tricky. Generally, students are familiar with the term, 'frequency' but they asked for wavelength instead of frequency. Most of the derivations are simple," said  , Physics teacher at   high school.
 
 "The paper was very easy. Students were very happy as everything came from the notes given to them in school. The 5-mark questions, including the numericals, were straightforward. The 3 and 2 marks questions were also easy. 
 
 These included definitions and basic concepts of each chapter. The numericals involved simple calculations and understanding of basic formulae. Overall, the paper was easy," said D Pant, head of the department of Physics from  's Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh.
