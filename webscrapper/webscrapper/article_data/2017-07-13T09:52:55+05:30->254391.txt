Actor  , who was arrested and charged with   for the abduction and assault of a Malayalam actress, has been sent to police custody for two days.
 
 The magistrate court in Angamaly earlier in the day will consider his bail plea only after the remand period. Reports say that the cops will take Dileep to Kochi and Thrissur, locations where they believe the conspiracy plot was hatched, to retrace the crime. Dileep was brought to the Aluva police club by noon. 
 
 
  
 Lawyer K Ramkumar, who had appeared for Dileep, contends that the actor has been framed and evidence was fabricated. The police has apparently raised 19 “irrefutable” proof against Dileep before they made the   on Monday.
  
 On Tuesday, the actor was expelled from cine organisations such as AMMA, FEFKA and producers’ association – all of which had him as an executive member.
