NEW DELHI: Three Day before social activist   is to organize an agitation in the capital on the Jan Lokpal and farmers' issues on March 23, Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan has urged the Anti-corruption crusader to call off the agitation, citing his health and age.
 
 
 "This is not a small issue which can be solved just like that. This will take some time. I hope we arrive at a solution soon. I hope he calls off the strike, keeping in mind his health and age," Mahajan said after his meeting with Hazare in Ahmednagar.
 
  
  
 Hazare has called for ‘satyagraha’ in the capital on March 23 to press for the appointment of a "competent Lokpal" and to highlight farmers' issues.
 
 Earlier this month, he had written a letter to the Prime Minister asking for space to organize his agitation in the capital.
 
 Hazare told PTI that he had written several letters to Union home minister Rajnath Singh as well as police and civic authorities of Delhi since November last year seeking a venue but got no response.
 
 Hazare, who has been the face of the Lokpal movement, had last year chosen March 23 to launch the agitation '
 ' as it happens to be the 'Shaheed Diwas' (Martyr's Day).
