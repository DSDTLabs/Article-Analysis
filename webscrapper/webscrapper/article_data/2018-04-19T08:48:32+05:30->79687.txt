UNNAO: Two CBI teams, headed by a superintendent of police, visited Unnao’s   village on Wednesday to investigate the murder case involving   MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s brother Atul Singh, who is currently on remand.

 Atul has been accused of beating up the   rape survivor’s father on the night of April 3 in village Makhi, which led to the latter’s death on April 9.
 
 On Wednesday, the rape survivor and her mother were also taken to Makhi. On CBI’s instructions, mediapersons were kept away from the crime scene.
 
 
 
 Sources said while Atul and one of his aides, Vineet, remained locked inside the police vehicle in which they had been taken to the village from Lucknow, his three other associates were made to de-board and the crime scene was recreated to collect evidence. The CBI team doing the proceedings also included forensic experts.
 
 “Bauwa, Shailu and Sonu were taken to the crime spot for a brief period. The CBI team conducted some investigation, collected evidence and clicked some photographs. Later, all the five accused, including Atul, were taken back to Lucknow,” said a source. The CBI team measured the distance between the Makhi police station and the MLA’s house, and also the distance between the rape survivor's house and the crime scene, the sources added.
 
 They also said that the CBI sleuths spoke to the rape survivor about the April 3 incident when accused Atul and his aides had allegedly thrashed her father mercilessly. They also spoke to the deceased’s wife and recorded her statement.
 
 The CBI team, after recording the statements, matched them with the crime scene, the sources said. The team arrived at the irrigation department's guest house at around 11am and left for Lucknow after 5.30 pm.
