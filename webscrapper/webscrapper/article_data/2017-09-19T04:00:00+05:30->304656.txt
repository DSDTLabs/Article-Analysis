Vadodara: Hoardings put up by a prominent condom brand in the city featuring actress and model Sunny Leone targeting the Navratri festival sparked a controversy on the social media. In the evening, the hoardings were removed by the company.

 The hoardings state that ‘Aa Navratrie namo parantu premthi’ meaning ‘Play this Navratri, but with love’. Founder president of the Happy Club, a student group that had a significant presence in the Faculty of Commerce of the M S University, and restaurateur Atit Patel posted the pictures on a social media platform sparking a debate. While the actual reason could not be verified, the hoardings were removed late in the evening.
 
 Patel said that what the hoarding was hinting at was true only with a minority of garba revellers. “Most come out for celebrations and not what the hoarding wants us to believe. It may be aimed at creating awareness, but it needs to be designed carefully so that it does not hurt sentiments,” Patel said. 
 
 He added that he was looking to approach the district collector and the mayor with a memorandum in this regard.
