NEW DELHI: With his focus firmly on guarding his home turf,   Arvind Kejriwal is planing to skip a crucial volunteers' meeting in   scheduled for Sunday. 

 Though   that his plan of going to Gujarat was only “tentative“, Kejriwal's decision to stay put in the city reflects that municipal polls are his key focus right now. 
 
 Kejriwal was supposed to address a volunteers meeting at Chavani Maidan in Gandhinagar as part of his mission to conquer Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state which will go to polls later this year.
 
 The booth level volunteers meeting will now be addressed by senior AAP leader and Delhi's Labour Minister Gopal Rai. Kejriwal will address over public meetings in Delhi, starting March 31.
