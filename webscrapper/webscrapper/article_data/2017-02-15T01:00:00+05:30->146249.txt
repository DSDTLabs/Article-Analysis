Despite, all the political happenings in the city, these young and bubbly Chennaiites have nothing, but only clubbing in their minds during weekends. On a Saturday night, all they want is to break free from all worries and party hard with their dear ones. These young ladies, who were dressed in chic party numbers, turned on the party mood as they grooved to the upbeat numbers of the DJ. Among others, Santana and Shika, were the ones who kept the fashion metre ticking. Santana was in a black jumpsuit with sheer panels on her sleeves, whereas Shika sported a floral party dress. Anita looked ravishing in a sari. While sporting a sari for an evening party, she made it point that it is one attire that can be worn at any occasion.
