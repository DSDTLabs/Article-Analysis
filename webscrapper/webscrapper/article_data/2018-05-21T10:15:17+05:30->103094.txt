 JAIPUR: The   is likely to shut down its three academic centres -  , Gandhian Studies and Women Studies - as they are being run without permanent faculty.
 
 
 The absence of teachers has reduced the number of students at these centres. The Centre for Jain Studies had once attained a position of major research centre on Jain texts — philosophy, religion, history and culture. But not a single student enrolled in 2017-18 academic session at this centre.
 
 After the last permanent faculty retired seven years ago, the RU has not initiated recruitment of faculty in this department.
 
 Sanjeev Bhanawat, administrative head, Centre of Jain Studies, RU, said, “Students use to make a beeline here for research. It has touched rock bottom due to absence of teachers. The MPhil at the centre was conducted with the help of guest faculty until a couple of years ago. However, a regulation of UGC states that a permanent faculty is required for MPhil, so the number of students has gone down miserably.”
 
 Similarly,   and Centre for Gandhian Studies opened in 1986 are likely to suspend the admission process in the upcoming academic session. Both the centres have hosted national-level seminars and conferences on the relevant themes in the past.
 
 Manju Sharma, head of botany department who also has the additional charge of the Centre for Women Studies, said, “The centre is very relevant and we have made all necessary changes in the course to make it more research- and job-oriented but absence of faculty has left us with very poor response from the students. The university should recruit teachers, or else these centres will shut down soon.”
 
 Several students have done MPhil from these centres but the new regulation of compulsory faculty for MPhil has left all three centres with no option but to stop the admission process.
