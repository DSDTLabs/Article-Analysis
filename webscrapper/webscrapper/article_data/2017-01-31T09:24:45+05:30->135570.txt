 Despite the three   officials having given undertakings to implement the  's reforms as per the apex court's January 2 order, the apex court did not give any indication on their roles during Monday's hearing.
 
 However, the office bearers aren't reading too much into it. On the contrary , they are of the opinion that the SC wouldn't have allowed both Choudhary and Chaudhary to represent BCCI at the International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in the first week of February in Dubai if they have no further role to play in the cricket board. Sources said the fact that Amitabh Choudhary convened the senior selection committee's meeting to pick the Indian team for the Bangladesh series in Delhi is proof that these officials will continue to work for the board. But it is also clear that Rai and board's CEO Rahul Johri are now the two most important people responsible for running the board, and the roles of the BCCI office bearers would come up for discussion in the days to come.
 
 But the ones, who ran the game all these years, are not happy that their paid executive, Johri, would be wielding more power in the running of cricket in the country .
 
 ICC would seek COA's letter
 
 Meanwhile, it is reliably learn that ICC will not allow the three BCC representatives ­ Choudhary , Chaud hary and Vikram Limaye ­ to attend all the meetings in Dubai. The COA would have to mention specific names for different meetings. ICC sources said if the three representatives don' have the signed letter from COA chair man Vinod Rai, they may be barred from attending the ICC meeting.
