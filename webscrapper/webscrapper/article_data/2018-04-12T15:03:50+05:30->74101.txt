KOLHAPUR:   corporators   and Ajinkya Chavan may have to pay a heavy price for casting their vote in favour of the BJP candidate in the standing committee elections. Both the corporators were slapped with showcause notices by the Pune divisional commissioner on Tuesday for defying the party whip. 

 The standing committee of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation is the strongest financial panel of the civic body. While electing the chairman of the standing committee, both Pirjade and Chavan had cast their vote for BJP candidate Ashish Dhawale who won by a margin of one vote over NCP candidate Megha Patil and clinched the chairman post.
 
 After the election, NCP leaders wrote to the divisional commissioner demanding expulsion of the corporators from the party. In response to the demand, Pune divisional commissioner Chandrakant Davali issued notices to both the corporators asking them to put their version in writing or orally before him by April 17. 
 
 A senior NCP corporator requesting anonymity said, “We have submitted the documents, photos and video of the corporators voting against our candidate in the election. The divisional commissioner should disqualify them as early as possible.”
 
 A whip is the orders issued by political parties to vote according to the party policy. The violation of the party whip invites expulsion under the Anti-Defection Act. NCP leaders are going to demand a detailed enquiry of the issue as they suspect BJP bribed the corporators to vote against Patil. 
 
 Both Pirjade and Chavan were not available for comment. However, it is learnt the BJP is going to lend every possible help including legal support to both of them.
