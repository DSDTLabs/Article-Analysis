SECUNDERABAD: Officials of the   (SCB) have decided to take up a comprehensive survey of land parcels in all the 16   under   jurisdiction to identify and remove encroachments. 

 The task of conducting the survey was entrusted to Kolkata-based CyberSWIFT Info Tech Limited. Earlier, SCB officials sought help of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H), but a quoted estimate of 1.2 crore was not feasible. The private firm agreed to conduct the survey for 19 lakh. 
 
 The 16 civil bazaar areas in Cantonment limits together make 25 acres, spanning 4,500 properties, formed during the Raj. The water and sewer line network laid during British era were gobbled up by encroachments, and shops, houses and other structures have been constructed on these lines.
 
 "We noticed over 90 per cent of the civil bazaars are under encroachment. An estimated 45,000 to 60,000 encroachments came up in a span of three decades. SCB does not give permission to such properties," SCB assistant engineer   told STOI. 
 
 As part of survey, boundary pillars will be fixed in all civil bazaar areas. Officials will launch the survey using differential global positioning system (DGPS) for accurate data, said Umashankar.
 
 "From SCB side, we have provided all the data on properties and maps to the firm, for completion of the survey by May 31. Once completed, a report will be submitted to the   (MoD) to take a decision on encroachments", he added.
