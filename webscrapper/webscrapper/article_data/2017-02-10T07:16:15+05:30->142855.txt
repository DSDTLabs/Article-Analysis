KOHIMA: The Naga Peoples' Movement for Human Rights (NPMHR) said Nagaland chief minister   must take moral responsibility for the recent   and 'step down as it happens in   and societies across the world, whether one is at fault or not.' In a release, the NPMHR said, "While issues of disagreements over the imposition of undesirable alien legal systems and   and ways of life continue to create chaos and confusion all these while ever since the Nagas declared their independence one day before India, on the 14th of August 1947, all successive state governments chose to defy and suppress its own people's wishes and aspirations in the name of 'upholding the Constitution."
