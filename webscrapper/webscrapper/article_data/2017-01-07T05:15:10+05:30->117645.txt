MUMBAI: The state government is racing against time to ensure that the   are inaugurated in the city before the   for the   is imposed. 

 Officials said the government plans to roll out the over Rs 100-crore project in the next few weeks. “We are all ready. We can inaugurate the Wi-Fi hotspots as soon as the chief minister gives us a date,” said anofficial from the IT department. Officials from the chief minister’s office said that they will hold the state cabinet meeting on Monday, instead of Tuesday, indicating that the election code of conduct may be imposed on Monday evening. 
 
 In August 2016, the state government had announced 1,200 Wi-Fi hotspots across Maharashtra, of which 500 were to be developed in Mumbai.
 
 “It is possible that   may inaugurate some hotspots to earn brownie points before the civic polls,” said an official. The CM’s pet project was to be launched in December 2016, but got delayed due to ‘some issues’ with procurement of hardware, said officials. 
 
 In Phase-I, 500 locations were identified across the city, including popular tourist sites like the  ,   and  , and slum clusters. Each Wi-Fi hotspot will have three to four access points and a 60-70m range, depending on the geography of the location. Each access point can have 40 users. The average speed will be 20Mbps and Wi-Fi will be free for the first 30 minutes for a maximum data of 100 MB; then the user has to pay. The charges will be cheaper than of other data providers that charge Rs 26-28 per 100MB. Officials said that for mass use, the state will give 100MB free, but at spots where Wi-Fi will be used for quality purposes, like colleges it will give 1GB free data.
 
 In Phase-II, which is expected to begin in February, 700 sites will be identified across the state, including schools, colleges and hospitals. It is expected to be completed by March.
