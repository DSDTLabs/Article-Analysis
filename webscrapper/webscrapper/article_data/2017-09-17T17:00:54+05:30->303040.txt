NAGPUR: Close on the heels of Ryan school, Bhondsi, incident, the education department has issued some strict guidelines to all schools falling under six districts of the Nagpur division to ward off any such incidents. These schools have been directed to inform the parents concerned in case their wards are absent from their respective schools, and wherever possible, to use technology that will inform them about entry and exit of their children from schools. 

 Deputy director of education (Nagpur division) Anil Pardhi made it clear that these guidelines applied to all schools, regardless of the board these are affiliated with. Pardhi has also placed a condition on outsider (parent/relative/etc) meeting a child on campus. He said, “The meeting must happen inside principal’s cabin only with either the principal or a teacher present there. The school has to ensure that CCTV cameras are installed in all important locations and that the boundary is protected by a proper wall (brick and mortar), not by barbed wires or trees." 
 
 Pardhi has banned entry of outsiders inside classrooms while the school is in progress. “Entry to outsiders has to be prohibited as far as possible. If at all it is granted for important reasons then the person/s under no circumstances be allowed to reach the classroom," Pardhi said. 
 
 He also demanded police verification of all teaching and non-teaching staff working in schools. “ID cards must be issued even to auto and bus drivers and police verification of these staffers must be done," the deputy director said. The weak link of some schools handing over kids based on “trust" factor rather than proper security protocol has also been mentioned. Pardhi said, “A system has to be devised to ensure that after school, children are handed over to parents after proper identification."
