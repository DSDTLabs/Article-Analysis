NAGPUR: Even as the cops are dragging their feet on the decision to register an offence against the management and employees of Haldiram Food’s Krazy Castle Aqua Park, it has now come to fore that the   footages of the wave pool where 2 persons died are missing. The CCTV footage of the Ambazari Road-located aqua park’s other places, however, are available, cops told TOI. 

 As the mystery over the CCTV footages seems to be getting murkier, the police’s probe now faces several questions. With there being no sign of justice for Sagar Sahasrabudhe and   — the two deceased, the latter’s family and friends would take out a candle march on Wednesday at Gandhi Putla Chowk. 
 
 Police also claimed to have seized the recording device of the CCTV cameras from the park management. The probe team now wants to send it for advanced forensic test to rule out evidence tempering. Police department wanted to scan through the CCTV footage to ascertain whether the pool attendants, life guards and the other employees had acted negligently leading to the incident. 
 
 The CCTV footage could have also exposed the lacuna of the management if any. Zonal DCP   was hoping to treat the CCTV footages as crucial evidence in the case. 
 
 One of the park’s directors, Kamal Agrawal had told TOI that he intended to see the CCTV footages for conducting an internal probe. “We have sympathy for the families of the deceased. We had a system in place for which there had been no untoward incident in the last 15 years, which should be also considered. Our employees rendered help but we did not get any information from hospital,” he said. 
 
 It’s learnt that the   police have now sought documents pertaining to the park’s permission, agreements and such testimonials from the management. The park is shut down under orders of collector Ashwin Mudgal.
