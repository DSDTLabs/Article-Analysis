GURUGRAM: A resident of   was duped of Rs 4.22 lakh by a man she met on a matrimonial site. Sonatona Senapati told cops she had met the accused, Amandeep Raghuraj, on a matrimonial site in March. He introduced himself as a doctor practising in California. They exchanged numbers and soon started chatting on WhatsApp. 

 After a few days, Raghuraj told Senapati he was working with the UN peacekeeping mission in Kabul.
 
 Gradually, Raghuraj proposed to her and the two decided to marry a month after he returned to India in May.
 
 On April 10, Raghuraj told her he was not getting his “pass card” to get out of Kabul, and requested Senapati to transfer Rs 97,000 to one Vikas Kumar’s account in Patna. He told her Kumar was the secretary to the UN attorney general, who would help him in procuring the “pass card”. The accused then kept asking her to transfer more money to different bank accounts on various occasions, on the pretext of not having received his paycheck and being stuck in Kabul. Senapati transferred Rs 4.2 lakh till May 1 to different account numbers provided by Raghuraj.
 
 The accused had told Senapati he would fly to Delhi from Kabul on May 5. On the day of travel, Raghuraj told her his flight had been delayed. When Senapati tried to confirm it with the airlines, she was told the flight was on time. Since then, Raghuraj stopped receiving her calls.
 
 Senapati registered a complaint against the accused on May 19, but the cops lodged an FIR only on Saturday, under sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating) of IPC and Section 66D (cheating by personation using computer resource) of the IT Act.
