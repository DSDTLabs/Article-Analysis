JAIPUR:  's poetry is not to be recited, but sung. Delivering her keynote address at the  , which began on Thursday, this experimental poet from the US sang ‘Anthropocene Blues’. She began with a “shout” to her sisters, daughters and friends marching in Washington to protest the impending inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States, calling it a “terrible inauguration”, a “dystopia”.

 She said she felt invigorated being in Jaipur at this time. Her sung poem also called on the gathering at the lawns of Diggi Palace, and asked them to wake up to ‘Anthropocene Blues’ -- the fact that nothing remains untouched by human hands.
 
 Recalling German philosopher Theodor Adorno, she asked if beauty and creativity were possible in times of such cruelty, and urged listeners to respond in the affirmative with acts they perform in their daily lives “to ease the pain of living”, to bring a certain immunity to the “drunken dumb show”.
 
 Libraries, she said, are as old as cities -- in ancient Chaldea, the idea of chaos was living without a library. Language must not become endangered, she said.
 
 Speaking at the event poet Gulzar thanked the JLF for helping the young grow, and keeping the old young. He spoke of his fear of being the “honoured guest”, of sitting in high chairs which does not let one's feet touch the ground.
 
 “It's necessary to dirty one's feet to stay true as a writer,” he said. He dwelt also on the diversity of languages in India, and urged organizers of the festival to take up one region and celebrate its poetry -- the ghazals of northeast, for instance.
 
 Chief minister   thanked JLF for helping Jaipur see the need to “smarten up” to receive visitors from across the world, year after year.
