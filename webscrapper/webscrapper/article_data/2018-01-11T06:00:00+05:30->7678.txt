Nagpur: A 75-year-man grandfather has moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court demanding scholarship and award for his granddaughter under ‘Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj Merit Awards scheme’.

 The scheme is for the toppers of SSC examinations. The HC bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi issued notices to the respondents, including principal secretary of social justice, sports and special assistance department in Mumbai, commissioner for social welfare in Pune, assistant commissioner for social welfare, and secretary of the Sstate Board secretary in Nagpur. All of them were told to respond by January 23.
 
 According to petitioner Rambhau Ambulkar, his granddaughter Rajvi topped the SSC examinations in state among SC candidates by scoring 495/500 marks in 2016. He quoted a government notification of June 11, 2003, where a candidate topping the board exams from the SC category would be awarded Rs2.50 lakh along with a memento and certificate of appreciation under the ‘Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj Merit Awards scheme’.
 
 Similarly, those securing first place from ST category would be felicitated with Rs1 lakh cash award along with a memento and certificate.
 
 The petitioner, through lawyer Arun Patil, claimed that the respondents were unnecessarily delaying the award to his granddaughter even after passage of over a year. He prayed for early conferring of the award to Rajvi along with 12% interest on the award money and Rs 50,000 towards litigation expenses. 
 
 Assistant government pleader AG Damle waived off the notices for the respondents.
