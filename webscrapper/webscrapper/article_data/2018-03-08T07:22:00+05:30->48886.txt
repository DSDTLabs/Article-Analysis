GHAZIABAD: A budget of Rs 773 crore was cleared for the   (GMC) by its 12-member executive committee, in a meeting on Wednesday. In this financial year, GMC also expects to raise Rs 893 crore as revenue under various heads. 

 It was the first full-fledged executive committee meeting since the new dispensation took charge of GMC three months ago. Given the nature of the budgetary allocation for 2018-19, it’s clear that GMC will focus on roads, sewerage and other civic amenities. A budget of Rs 173 crore has been earmarked for this purpose.
 
 The meeting also cleared a separate budget of around Rs 220 crore, for a proposed political institute, mooted by Mayor  , which is to come up in  , and for which the state government has already pledged a grant of Rs 60 crore. However, not much is known about what this institute will actually be.
 
 GMC has also laid emphasis on general health of residents. A sum of Rs 87 crore has been earmarked under this head for financial year 2018-19. 
 
 The city has an elaborate network of water pipelines, yet, during peak summer, availability of water becomes a problem. With a budgetary allocation of Rs 77 crore, GMC hopes to strengthen its water infrastructure across the city’s five municipal zones. Under other heads, like streetlights, upkeep of parks and under social welfare schemes, GMC expects to spend Rs 12 crore, Rs 26 crore and Rs 4.5 crore respectively. 
 
 The GMC hopes to raise Rs 644 crore from taxes and state government grants, with an additional Rs 249 crore already lying with GMC from last financial year, bringing the total amount to Rs 893 crore. 
 
 The executive committee prior to deliberating on GMC’s budget also elected vice president of the GMC. The committee comprising of seven BJP members while rest from other parties elected BJP’s Sunil Yadav as the vice president of GMC’s executive committee.
