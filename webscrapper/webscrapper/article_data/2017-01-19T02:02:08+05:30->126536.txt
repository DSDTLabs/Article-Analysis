GURGAON: The Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam ( ) had to eat a humble pie on Tuesday after it failed to produce evidence against a resident of Civil Lines who dragged the power discom to the Permanent Lok Adalat in Gurgaon in March 2015 after it imposed a   of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh on him.

 The discom, in its defence, had maintained 63-year-old   was the guarantor of another consumer who had defaulted in the wake of which his penalty amount was added to Jagdish’s bill. But the discom had not produced any evidence to corroborate its claim. Jagdish, on his part, had furnished all the relevant documents that strengthened the case in his favour.
 
 Sources said Justice   had last month ruled in favour of Jagdish, while pulling up the discom for arbitrariness. It also barred the discom from recovering the amount (Rs 2,44,437) from Jagdish or withdrawing his power connection, and asked it to compensate the consumer the litigation cost of Rs 10,000.
 
 On Tuesday though, the DHBVN’s superintending engineer (Gurgaon circle) shot a letter to officials concerned, asking them to comply with the court’s directions, while recovering the litigation cost of Rs 10,000 from the erring power discom official.
 
 “As the nigam has failed to prove its position to prove the imposition of Rs 2,44,437 on the consumer, it is therefore desired that bill may be corrected and penalty may be recovered from the erring official for fixing the (wrong) liability,” the letter read.
