Nagpur: Swachhata App, a mobile application introduced by the Union urban development (UD) ministry for addressing complaints related to civic issues, has a new feature whereby citizens can locate public toilets in the vicinity via the app. The Swachhata App is available for Android smartphones and can be downloaded from Google Play Store. The ‘Public Toilet Nearby’ feature in the app gives location and information of 226 toilets in Nagpur city. It is about 80% of the total toilets, including pay and use toilets, across the city. “More locations would be added in future,” said health officer (sanitation) Dr Pradip Dasarwar. The NMC has also included 66 toilets of fuel stations and 15 toilets of hospitals in the app. Besides, toilets of 23 gardens across the city can also be located via the app.  “Earlier, there was only one feature in the app wherein the users would post complaints related to garbage not cleared, sweeping not done etc,” Dr Dasarwar said. The NMC provided data of all the public toilets with locations to Google Maps and the information was uploaded in the map, he added. Anybody can also write a review on existing facilities at the toilets. Dr Dasarwar said the authorities will soon upgrade the existing conditions and services of public toilets and also help in updating locations of all public toilets which do not feature on the app at present. Besides this, the data is now available on Google Maps, with the option for users to rate the cleanliness of the public utility too. As many as 43,474 Nagpurians have downloaded the Swachhata App. Of these, 24,087 have also posted complaints pertaining to cleanliness. “So far, we have resolved 19,774 complaints and 17,944 complaints were attended within 12 hours after being lodged,” Dr Dasarwar said. The sanitation department rejected around 4,083 complaints. Department officials said most complaints reported in Nagpur city were from nearby tehsil places like Saoner, Khapa, Katol, Kalmeshwar, Umred etc.
