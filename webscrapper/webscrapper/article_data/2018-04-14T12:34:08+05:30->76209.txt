HYDERABAD: Those indulging in  ,  ! Year 2018 is witnessing perhaps the toughest drive  , if figures provided by the Hyderabad traffic police department are anything to go by.

 
  
  
 
 Data suggests in a massive crackdown against drunk driving, Hyderabad traffic cops jailed more than 1,300 offenders in the first three months of 2018 alone, out of the total 6,950 cases booked against inebriated drivers.
 
 While 52 licences have been permanently cancelled for this offence in the same time, a total of 539 driving licences have been suspended for periods ranging from three months to five years, till March 2018, latest data shows.
 
 In 2014, 2015 and 2016, no driving licences were suspended for drunk driving. Even in 2017, the number was significantly smaller — 203. In comparison, this year, cops permanently cancelled as many as 13 licences in March.
 
 While a majority of the driving licences suspended in 2018 are for a three-month period, 92 have been suspended for a period of one year and 55 have been suspended for a period of two years.
 
 While 19 licences have been suspended for a period of three years, three motorists had their licences suspended for five years for drunk driving (till March 2018), the data states. A total compounding amount of Rs 1.6 crore (approx) has also been collected by traffic cops as part of drunk driving enforcement activities between January and March. Road safety experts, while lauding the crackdown, also called for awareness campaigns along stricter enforcement to curb the menace in city.
 
 “Cancelling driving licences for drunk driving offences is a laudable move and can help in reducing the number of inebriated drivers. Taking Telangana’s example into consideration, many other states are also following suit, cancelling licences and imprisoning offenders. Awareness and education campaigns must also be carried out simultaneously,” said  , CEO of Indian Federation of Road Safety.
