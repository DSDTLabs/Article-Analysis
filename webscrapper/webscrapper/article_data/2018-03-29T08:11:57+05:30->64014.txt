PANAJI: The controversy over Goa government charging outstation patients, especially from Maharashtra, for using public heath facilties in the state, has been resolved.

 The matter was amicably settled after the state health minister Vishwajit   called on Maharashtra chief minister   in Mumbai late Wednesday evening. Maharashtra government has decided to take onboard Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital as part of the hospitals empanelled under the   (MJPJAY), the Goa health minister said.
 
 The CEO of MJPJAY has been asked by the Maharashtra government to set up up a facilitation desk from the designated TPA (third party administrator) for Sindhudurg district at GMC to cater to patients from Maharashtra.
 
 “The desk will be set up at GMC in the next seven days,” Rane told TOI on Wednesday night. He also said that the revenue of GMC will also go up as the rates offered for interventions under Maharashtra government’s scheme are much higher than charged by GMC for outstation patients.
 
 On Tuesday, Rane had said that he would meet the Maharashtra CM to sort out the issue while reiterating that there would be no change in the decision taken by the state government to charge outstation patients using public health facilities in Goa. 
 
 As much as 35 % of the total number of patients at the GMC account for outstation patients from the neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Goa also has a high percentage of migrant population.
