Greater Noida: The immovable properties of three persons accused in the murder of   worker   were attached on Friday. The state police have also announced a Rs 50,000 reward each for the arrest of Anil Bhati, Sahdev Bhati and   and issued a lookout notice against Anil to ensure he does not flee abroad.

 Teams from different police stations conducted the attachment exercises in the houses of Anil and Sahdev and Sheru in Ghaghola village of Greater Noida. The teams seized generator sets, furniture, AC, fridge, LED TV sets, utensils, and other items. They also detached the doors and windows and took them away.
 
 The three have been associated with the   gang for several years. Sahdev and Anil are the brother and nephew of Sunder Bhati, who is currently in judicial custody.
 
 “The teams brought all the items seized to Bisrakh police station in five trucks. The houses were also sealed. We have launched a search to arrest the absconding criminals,” said Prabhat Dixit, the PRO of Noida police.
 
 The police said they had issued notices to the absconding trio but they did not respond. They also ignored the summons issued by a court and skipped the hearing. The attachment exercise was conducted for around eight hours at the three houses.
 
 Dixit said a lookout notice had been issued against Anil Bhati in the case. “Police personnel from different stations have been asked to launch a search for him. We are trying to ensure he does not flee abroad,” he said.
 
 On February 16, the district and sessions court had issued a non-bailable warrant against the trio in connection with Yadav’s murder. Yadav and his two gunners were killed in Tigri village in Noida Extension on November 16, 2017.
