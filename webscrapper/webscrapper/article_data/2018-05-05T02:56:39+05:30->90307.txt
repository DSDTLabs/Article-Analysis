NEW DELHI: Four years after constable Jagvir Singh was shot dead by burglars, his family still awaits Rs 1 crore compensation.

 On Friday, the high court demanded an explanation from the Centre and the Delhi government why the compensation was not paid, despite the ex-gratia being announced by the then lieutenant governor with much ‘fanfare’.
 
 Justice Rajiv Shakdher remarked that, “There was all this fanfare that Rs 1 crore would be paid. Then why it is not paid.” It then issued a notice to the state and the Centre on a plea moved by the slain constable’s wife for grant of the promised compensation.
 
 HC sought the stand of the ministry of home affairs, the Delhi government and the LG on a plea filed by Singh’s wife after he was allegedly shot dead by a gang of five burglars outer Delhi’s Vijay Vihar on October 13, 2014. All the five accused were later arrested.
