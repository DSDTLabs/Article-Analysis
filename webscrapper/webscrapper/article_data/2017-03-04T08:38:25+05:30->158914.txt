CHINTAPALLI (VISAKHAPATNAM): The AP   ( ) is likely to take over the   distributed to tribals by the Maoists six years ago and cultivate them. 

 CPI Maoists had distributed around 1,000 hectares of coffee plantations to tribals in between 2008 to 2011. Due to lack of knowledge in harvesting the coffee crop, the tribals had not cultivated the plantations. 
 
 On request of a few tribals, the APFDC is reportedly chalking out plans to take over these plantations and provide employment to the local tribals in the same. If all the 1,000 hectares are brought under cultivation, then APFDC would get another 300 tonnes of clean coffee and provide employment to hundreds of tribal families, sources said.
 
 “ A few tribals are willing to give up the plantations to the APFDC for cultivation. In return, the APFDC would provide them employement. At present, they are not employed and have no earning from these plantations,” a senior official of APFDC told TOI.
 
 APFDC has 4,010 hectares (around 10,000 acres) of coffee plantations at various places in the agency, of which Maoists distributed around 1,000 hectares in Kumkumpudi, Lankapakalu and part of PSS Reddy plantations (Gudem II) in RV Nagar West estate and Balapam in   coffee estates. The majority of the plantations in the RV Nagar West were distributed in 2008 starting with Kukumpudi.
 
 APFDC has restarted cultivating around 32 hectares at Gunala Lanka out of the distributed 110 hectares in PSS Reddy estate in RV Nagar West on request of the tribals this year. Around 80 tribal families were employed in the cultivation process.
