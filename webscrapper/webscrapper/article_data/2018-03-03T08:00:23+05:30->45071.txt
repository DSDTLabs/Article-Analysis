HYDERABAD: All India   (AIMIM) chief,  , on Friday asked his party members to be ready for an early Lok Sabha election. He also challenged Prime Minster Narendra Modi to dissolve the parliament, and face the people in the elections, speaking on the occasion of the party's diamond jubilee celebrations held at its headquarters in Darussalam. 

 Urging party workers to take all efforts to wipe out the   (BJP) and   (INC) from the state, Owaisi vowed to ensure that the BJP was defeated in the Secunderabad Lok Sabha constituency and the existing five assembly seats in Telangana.
 
 "We have to increase the number of MLA's in Telangana and ensure BJP and INC are finished in the state. When it comes to developmental works we will fight and get things done," said Owaisi.
 
 As part of MIM's 60th revival day celebrations, he hoisted the party flag and felicitated senior workers.
 
 "It is important to recollect the efforts of party leaders and workers including   today. Many of them even had to go to jail while fighting for a good cause," Owaisi said.
 
 Reacting to questions raised on his decision to praise the chief minister in Assembly a couple of months ago, Owaisi said that he would not shy away from praising the Telangana chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, if the promised works were being completed.
 
 Later, the MIM chief also took pot-shots at former   (AIMPLB) member, Maulana Salman Nadvi, who had recently claimed that the AIMPLB would meet its end soon if Owaisi wasn't removed from its board.
