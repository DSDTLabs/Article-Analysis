MUMBAI: As class X students prepare for their   exams, the education department is busy giving finishing touches to the online   process for First Year Junior College.

 
 According to officials from the deputy director of education, Mumbai, the college registration process is likely to start in the first week of March. “Junior colleges that have made any changes in subjects offered or intake capacity will have to update details on the portal. The rest of the colleges will only have to verify details. Meanwhile, the software agency is working on improving admission forms,” said an official. A GR announcing the tentative dateline for the centralised admission process will be issued shortly.
 
 Over the past four months, the admissions committee has met thrice to propose improvements in the process.
 
 
 Among those likely to be accepted are inclusion of admission to the bifocal stream in the online process and giving students a button in their login to activate an admission if they want to secure their seat at a particular college. The second suggestion was made after complaints from several students last year that colleges confirmed their seats in the online process even without asking them.
 
 
 The centralised online process for   covers all junior college in Mumbai and Thane. Over two lakh students register in over 700 junior colleges. The admission procedure will begin after declaration of   results in the first week of June.
