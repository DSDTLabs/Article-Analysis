ABOHAR ( ): Even as the Union cabinet cleared an ordinance allowing the death sentence for those who rape minors, a couple in   climbed up a water tank on Saturday after police officials failed to arrest a man accused of raping their 11-year-old daughter for the past year. The couple also alleged that they were being forced to strike a compromise with the accused.

 The parents claimed that the alleged rapist was moving around freely in town for more than 20 days after an FIR was registered. On Saturday, they went to meet the DSP to pressurise him to arrest the accused but he told them that he was still investigating the case. Upset with the delay, the couple climbed up the tank near the DSP’s office in protest and threatened to commit suicide by jumping down if police officials didn’t arrest the accused.
 
 The protesting parents kept police and district officials on their toes for more than six hours refusing to climb down from the tank.
 
 
 
 
 They relented only after local leaders intervened.
 
 Admitting that local police did not do enough, Fazilka SSP Dr Chetan Baliram Patil said departmental action would be taken against the station house officer of police station where the complaint was registered, and the DSP.
 
 “The accused will be arrested shortly,” Patil said.
 
 “Officials did not act promptly as the case was one year old but after it came to my notice, I have directed the SP to arrest the accused at the earliest.”
 
 According to the couple, their girl was raped for almost a year. The accused had threatened to kill her parents if she broke her silence. The couple found out about the crime on March 21 this year and registered a complaint.
 
 The police registered an FIR on March 31but did not arrest the accused. While the accused comes from a family of well-off farmers, the parents are dailywage labourers.
