MUMBAI: Following TOI’s report on Tuesday about three trees at   being trimmed in a manner that left them completely leafless, the   swung into action and immediately put red soil in all the affected tree basins to ensure healthy regrowth. 

 Local corporator from Cuffe Parade, Harshita  , also inspected the area along with the BMC horticulturist and the contractor and condemned the manner in which trees were overtrimmed. BMC officials said they were making all efforts to protect the trees and ensure the growth of green cover.  , BMC assistant municipal commissioner of ‘A’ ward, said their staff did visit the site on Tuesday and the tree basin was reinforced with soil. “Our staff has placed red soil around the tree to strengthen them. 
 
  
  
 Meanwhile, a showcause notice has already been issued to the contractor on why appropriate instructions on trimming of trees were not followed,” said Dighavkar. On March 26, the BMC had given the contractor directions on scientific trimming. Some of these included the horticulturist appointed by the trimming agency to be present at the site during trimming work, care to be taken to trim branches on all sides in order to balance the tree, banners placed at each site a minimum 24-48 hours before the actual trimming work so that residents can find alternative parking for cars. 
 
 Narwekar said she had immediately raised the issue. In a letter sent to the BMC, a copy of which is with the TOI she said the contractor had gone ahead and cut the trees in an irresponsible manner, leaving only stumps in the name of pruning. “I condemn such irresponsible cutting without any supervision of a horticulturist present at the time of pruning/ trimming. I request you to penalize the said contractor for the above mentioned illegal work so that such incidents don’t happen in future,” reads the letter sent to BMC.
