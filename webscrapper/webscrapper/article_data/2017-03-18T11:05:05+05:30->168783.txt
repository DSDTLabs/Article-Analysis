PUNE: The government would soon evolve a river sediment management policy in which the   would play a pivotal role in developing an environment-friendly methodology — economically and technically feasible. 

 A press statement issued by the commission stated that common practices carried out by river management agencies demonstrated that sediment management till late had been based on limited scientific knowledge. “A different approach to sediment management is desirable, incorporating knowledge and management of sediments at the basin skill and a wider application of available scientific knowledge,” it stated.
 
 The central government on Friday. organized a national seminar on “Sediment Management in Indian Rivers” in New Delhi. Commission chairman   said that many committees had been constituted in the past to look into the silting problems in rivers and suggest suitable remedial measures. He expressed hope that the conference would be a step ahead in this direction and extensive consultations among stakeholders would result in a comprehensive policy. 
 
 “Over the years, silting of rivers has assumed serious proportions. A different approach to sediment management is desirable, incorporating knowledge and management of sediments at the basin skill and a wider application of available knowledge,” said Kumar. 
 
 Parineeta Dandekar of   on Dams, Rivers and People. said rivers were a lifeblood of the ecology and carried much more than water. “The rivers carry silt from various points in their journey from the hills to the deltas. In this journey, the type, quantity and movement of silt varies with place and time. It is the transfer of silt from upper catchments to the plains that helps build fertile and alluvial flood plains like the Indo-Gangetic plains,” stated Dandekar in one of her research papers.
