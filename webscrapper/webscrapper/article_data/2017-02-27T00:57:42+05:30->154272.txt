Hyderabad: In a relief to thousands of engineering students, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H) is considering the option of uploading answer sheets   and issuing photocopies of it to students who apply for re-evaluation.

 The suggestions came up in meetings of a committee set up to bring in transparency in   after protests by students this month. The committee is headed by JNTU-H rector N V Ramana Rao.
 
 “We looked into patterns of evaluation during previous years and found that while the pattern is the same, there is a 5% increase in failures. This can be attributed to stringent evaluation and deteriorating quality of students,” said a committee member. 
 
 The members also came up with recommendations, including placing answer sheets online. “We also suggest that the university checks the academic background of students before re-evaluation. If a student’s performance has been consistently poor, then it will be easy for the university to verify his credibility,” said a senior faculty member. 
 
 To ensure credibility of evaluators, the committee plans to develop a data bank of teachers nominated by colleges for evaluation so that the varsity can verify that they have enough experience in the subject. The report of the committee will be submitted this week.
 
 Providing answer sheets to students is not a new phenomenon. After the engineering, agriculture and medical entrance tests, candidates can access their OMR sheets online.
