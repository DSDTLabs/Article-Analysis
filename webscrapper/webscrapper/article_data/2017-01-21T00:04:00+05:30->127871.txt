KANPUR:   (BKU) leader Niranjan Rajput and his aide Vishakha, accused of creating ruckus with hundreds of activists at the chief minister’s rally in Hamirpur on December 15 and clashing with police on December 18 at Lahurimau village in Ghatampur, were arrested on Wednesday night.

 The farmers led by Rajput have been demanding better compensation for their land acquired by the government for the thermal power plant and also a rehabilitation package. Union minister of state for power, coal and new & renewable energy Piyush Goyal had laid the foundation stone of the 1,980 mw thermal power plant in Ghatampur on October 20. 
 
 The power plant is scheduled to begin in 2020. Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd and Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Nigam have formed a joint venture for the power plant. It is proposed to come up in an area of 2,500 acres of land.
 
 Niranjan had led the agitation at the rally of chief minister   in Hamirpur on December 15, causing disruption. 
 
 When a police team went to arrest him on December 18 in connection with ruckus in CM’s Hamirpur programme, they had to face stiff resistance from hundreds of armed farmers, in which 17 police personnel, including six women constables and a CO, had sustained injuries.
 
 Since then, Niranjan was evading arrest. SSP Akash Kulhari said, “Niranjan and his aide Vishakha have been arrested while they were proceeding towards Allahabad to participate in BKU rally.”
