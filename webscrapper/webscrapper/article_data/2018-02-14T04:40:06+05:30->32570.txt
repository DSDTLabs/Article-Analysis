MUMBAI:   might be nearing its end, but nights are only getting cooler in the city, with the   dipping for the past three days. However, while nights may seem pleasant, the   has forecast an increase in   over the next few days.

 Ghatkopar resident Mansi Parekh said that on Monday night and Tuesday morning were very cold. “The day also felt very pleasant owing to the temperatures,” Parekh said.
 
 On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 15.8 degree Celsius, which was two degrees below normal, while the Colaba observatory recorded 19 degrees Celsius, 0.9 degree below normal.
 
 Last year, the lowest recorded minimum temperatures for the month of February was 14 degrees Celsius.
 
 This also brought relief for the city considering that owing to the haze last week, the minimum temperatures were hovering around 20 degrees Celsius. Weathermen said that the chill was owing to the wind pattern. “The winds have become completely northerly which is bringing in cooler air. But slowly we forecast day time temperatures to increase as dry weather may prevail owing to the current winds. The wind direction is then likely to change to north easterly,” said Ajay Kumar, scientist at IMD Mumbai.
 
 On Tuesday, the day time temperatures remained below normal making it a comparatively pleasant day. 
 
 The maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD’s Colaba observatory was 28.4 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees above normal) and Santacruz observatory was 30.4 degrees Celsius.
 
  The relative humidity recorded by the Colaba observatory was 72% and Santacruz was 49%.
