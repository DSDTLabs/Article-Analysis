JODHPUR: The Bishnoi community, predictably angry at the decision of the sessions court, has said that it will file a petition in the Rajasthan high court challenging the grant of bail to film star Salman Khan on Saturday. 

 
  
 
 Terming the decision unfortunate and a blow to their long legal battle to bring justice for the blackbucks that were killed way back in October 1998, the community vowed to ensure that Salman and the five others acquitted in the case, including Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu , are "brought to justice". 
 
  "It's a very sad day for us as the court has granted bail barely two days after Salman was convicted and sentenced to five years for killing two blackbucks," said Ram Niwas Dhori of Bishnoi Tiger Force. 
 
 Ran Niwas Budhnagar of the Bishnoi Vanyajeev Evam Paryavaran Sansthan said that the organisation along with others would study the bail order, consult legal experts and challenge it in the upper court. "We will not only challenge Salman's bail by the sessions court but also appeal against the acquittal of the five co-accused, including four other film actors," he said.
