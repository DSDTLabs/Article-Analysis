Tirupur: Fans in India as well as abroad are mourning the death of the most celebrated  ,  , who died here on Sunday at the ripe age of 20.

 The death of the majestic bull, which was considered to be the purest form of Kangeyam breed, has gone viral on social media also.
 
 Senapathy Kangeyam Cattle Research Foundation (SKCRF), which owned the bull, said “Bully Boy was one of the key factors that attracted the younger generation into the selective breeding of the Kangeyam breed. The foundation has lost its gem.”
 
 “Being born into a family, which was known for selective breeding of Kangeyam cattle, Kartheikeya Sivasenapathy, managing trustee of SKCRF, was attracted to Bully Boy when he was born in 1998. He was Sivasenapathy’s favourite,” said trustee of the foundation Sabariprakash Mahalingam.
 
 “We can confidently say that Bully Boy’s gigantic physique was unmatchable and he was a perfect specimen of Kangeyam, the drought-resistant breed. He had sugarcane-isque horn, double hump, perfect barrel and chests, compact shoes, thin tail and shining skin. People easily fell in love with him. So many people used to take selfies with him that he was undoubtedly the most-photographed bull,” he told TOI.
 
 Bully Boy was well known for his procreation prowess. “While it is common for bulls to have a dominant streak, Bully Boy retained a special dominant character till the end—he was always eager to mate. Even after attaining the age of five or six, many bulls are not comfortable about the mating process. But, Bully Boy was a natural and involved in the act even two days before he died,” a visibly proud Sabariprakash said.
 
 The magnificent bull had served as a stud his whole life and even 20 days ago, was in active duty at a private cattle farm in Coimbatore.
 
 The bull, which was a product of selective breeding, died at Kuttappalayam in Kangeyam.
