AHMEDABAD: The cracking of the brutal rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl and her mother in Surat by the Ahmedabad crime branch has caused a disquiet among a section of senior police officers in Surat. 

 Recently, D B Vaghela, who is holding the charge of most important Surat detection crime branch ( ), wrote to city police commissioner  , requesting him to relieve him to this charge. 
 
 Vaghela was already burdened as he held the charges of administration department, headquarters, special branch, traffic as well as Surat (range). His main posting was as JCP (sector 2).
 
 It is learnt that Vaghela was unhappy as the DCB team was very close to detecting the case, but missed the clincher. Finally, Ahmedabad crime branch team cracked the case and arrested prime accused Harsayai Gurjar from Gangapur in Rajasthan and resolved the mystery. 
 
 Few hours after the state's junior home minister   held a press conference to give details about the case detection, Sharma had told TOI that the city police had got the closed circuit television footages and roped in experts from Vadodara, who helped them decipher the registration plate of the car used to dump the girl and her mother in Pandesara.
 
 Officials close to Vaghela also said that he was unhappy over the fact that important clues related to the crime somehow got leaked, which ultimately resulted in the Surat police's failure to detect despite coming so close.
 
 In police circles, Vaghela is said to be an efficient officer whose track record in maintaining law and order and cracking few important cases in Ahmedabad as additional commissioner of police (CP) (sector II) had drawn appreciation. He had arrested a well-connected police informer   for shooting to death a man in Rakhial a year ago. Baasi is currently lodged in Sabarmati Central Jail. 
 
 Ahmedabad's police commissioner A K Singh had even written a letter of appreciation to Vaghela in this case, the sources said.
