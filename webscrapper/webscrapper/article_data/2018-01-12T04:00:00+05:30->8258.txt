Vadodara: The controversy over alleged irregularities in the slum rehabilitation project of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) at Sanjaynagar has snowballed into a full-fledged war of words with fingers being pointed at ruling BJP’s elected representatives.

 BJP’s Manjalpur MLA Yogesh Patel, who had reportedly met chief minister Vijay Rupani, said that he would seek a vigilance inquiry in the matter. “If my name crops up in any irregularity, I would resign as an MLA,” he told media persons on Thursday.
 
 But Patel did not clarify if he had met Rupani to raise the issue. “A lot more will come out in the coming days,” he said. Patel even pointed fingers at VMC commissioner Vinod Rao saying that if Rao was found guilty in the inquiry, an offence should be registered against him. Rao did not comment on the issue.
 
 Mayor Bharat Dangar, who is being linked to one of the consortium partners, said that he had no connection with any of the parties in the joint venture. “The contractor had informed the administration about the change in the stake holding in the consortium in June. Also, it was the administration that had brought out a tender for the storm water drain. Why was no action taken at an early stage in June itself? There was no reason to wait till December,” he said.
