NAGPUR: Doctors at   removed a dental drill from the   of a patient recently. The drill had accidentally fallen into the   while the patient was undergoing a   procedure.

 The drill was so dangerously positioned that even a simple cough by the patient could have punctured the lungs or blood vessels in it, killing him. Even as experts were removing the drill using a bronchoscope, it was swallowed into the stomach by the patient. Finally, a gastroscope was used to safely maneuver the drill out of the body.
 
 Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, senior pulmonologist told TOI that the drill was lodged next to major blood vessels. "The patient as well as the dentist were very disturbed. But luckily there were not many complications. The patient was given local anaesthesia in the lungs using a nebulizer to avoid coughing," said Dr Swarnakar.
 
 However, when the drill ended up in the stomach, gastroenterologist Dr Abhiram Paranjpaye used a gastroscope to pull it out. "A trap-like basket was sent into the stomach using the gastroscope, which trapped the drill," he said.
 
 The team included interventional bronchoscopist Dr Deepak Mureja and respiratory expert Dr Anil Sontakke. "The whole procedure took 20-30 minutes. But it was a challenging task," said Dr Swarnakar.
 
 The doctors at Getwell Hospital say the patient was lucky to reach hospital without the drill moving inside the lungs.
