CHENNAI: The state government has taken a firm stand not to release more water from   dam saying there was good rainfall in the delta areas and moreover, there was not much water in the dam. He blamed   for not releasing   water and asked farmers in the delta districts to be prudent in the use of water for irrigation.

 “As of now only 21.70 tmcft water is available in Mettur dam. Karnataka should release 192tmcft of water into Cauvery as per the tribunal’s award. But, until now, the state has released only 111tmcft. Before the month of May this year, it has to release the remaining 81tmcft,” said the chief minister. “We have been pressurising the Karnataka government directly as well as through the Centre. We are also expecting the   judgment on the cases filed by us seeking release of Cauvery water within a few weeks,” said Palaniswami.
 
 On Tuesday, the Supreme Court said it would deliver within a month verdict on the decades-old Cauvery water dispute between   and Karnataka. It observed that enough confusion had been created over it for more than two decades.
 
 DMK MLA Durai Chandrasekar raised the issue in the state assembly on Wednesday and urged the government to release some more water as many areas in   and   districts have not received water and crops are likely to wither. He requested the government to open the dam once again so that water reaches the tail end areas and that may save the crops.
 
 “In 2017-18, water was released from Mettur dam on October 2 for samba cultivation on 12.83 acres. As of now, paddy crops are ready for harvest on 19,000 acres and in the remaining areas crop will be harvested in the coming months. It has rained even last night in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts and that will help cultivation of crops in these areas,” said the chief minister.
