 My trainer, Mili Kapoor, is the biggest source of inspiration and she always keeps me motivated. Her valuable inputs compel me to perform better every time.
 
 
 
 The biggest drawback is wearing an outfit and not looking your best. This used to make me feel conscious of my appearance, however, with 
  I have the freedom to wear whatever I want. 
 
 
 
 I will definitely maintain the weight which I have shed with such great effort.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 First and foremost thing, I started taking my dinner between 8 to 8.30 pm. I even quit sweets and   completely for 6 months. Getting up early to workout is another big change I made which was quite challenging for me.
 
 
 
 I have a sweet tooth and it was a very big challenge for me to quit sweets but somehow my trainer helped me with it. I replaced sugar with gur ( ) for a while. 
 
 
 It makes me feel more confident. It’s a feeling of self-satisfaction everyone should experience once. Whatever I wear, I look good in that without feeling conscious anymore.
