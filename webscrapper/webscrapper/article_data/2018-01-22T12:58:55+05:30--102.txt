JAMSHEDPUR:  , a 34-year-old employed temporarily by  , was out on the pitch on Sunday playing a 20-20 cricket match. He played exceptionally well, bowling economically and making his team the proud winner at the   ground. 

 In the final over,   stopped the rival batsmen from scoring seven runs. After winning the match, he returned to the pavilion and sat down. Shivam, however, fainted and fell down. He was immediately rushed to the Tata Motors hospital but the doctors there declared him brought dead. 
 
 Shivam was the only child of his parents and about to get married later this year.
 
 "After the win, Shivam took a round of the pitch bare chested, receiving accolades from the crowd and was headed towards the pavilion. Soon after arriving at the pavilion, he sat on a chair but he suddenly fainted and fell down," Tata Motors Workers' Union spokesperson Santosh Singh said. 
 
 Shivam was apparently drained when the match was over,   said, informing that Shivam was the brain behind the cricket tournament hosted by the company.
 
 "It was on his proposal that eight teams of the World Truck department was formed and the tournament commenced today," Singh said. 
 
 The Telco police said that the victim prima facie seemed to have died of cardiac arrest but the postmortem will confirm the actual cause. 
 
 "Autopsy of the body will be done on Monday at the MGMMCH," Telco police station in-charge Jayant Tirkey said.
