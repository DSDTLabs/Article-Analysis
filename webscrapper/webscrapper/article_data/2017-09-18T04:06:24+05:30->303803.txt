 He said that the road was jammed for over 20-25 minutes, causing severe inconvenience to people. Despite being warned the group did not move, forcing the cops to detain them.
 
 At the police station, when the buyers tried to file a complaint against the builder they were told that the project comes under the jurisdiction of Badshapur police station. 
 
 The protesters were detained till 9pm. They were produced before a magistrate and released on bail.
 
 Nitesh, however, said the group blocked the traffic only for 5-7 minutes and were not aware the area falls under Sadar police station and not Badshapur. He claimed that while 90% of the payment has been made, even the structure of the project is not completely ready.
