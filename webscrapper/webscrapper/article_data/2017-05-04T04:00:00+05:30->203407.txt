Vadodara: Fires in government buildings may be few but not unheard of.

 In 2003, the Kothi Annexe building that is older than the Kothi building where collectorâ€™s office is located, had caught fire. Extensive damage had taken place to the building at that time.
 
 In 2011, fire had broken out in the BJP office in the Khanderao Market headquarters of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The office was badly bugged and had to be renovated completely. It was only in 2013, that the VMC issued an advisory to all its officials asking them to take a series of steps to ensure that fire safety at its buildings. While taking care of wiring of the building was one of the major issues, work on the wiring was conducted only last year. Smoke detectors have also been placed in some important chambers. But sources point out that the fire safety arrangements like extinguishers are not sufficient to handle a major incident. Like any other government office, some departments have heaps of paper lying around. TNN
