Spending six hours in the bathtub is no mean feat — and in her latest video, singer   did just that. “In the middle of the night, the director of my   Shudai, decided to shoot the bathtub scene. We first immersed ourselves in cold water and then later switched to warm water. My co-star and I got into the tub, which was really small for two and since it was cold and a bit awkward, we had to relax and get the chemistry right. And just like that, it was sunrise till we got all the shots right!” 

 The bathtub plays a pivotal role in the video. “The video has a lot of chemistry, lust and love between two people and since we wanted to show the darkness and the sexiness of toxic love, the bath tub scene was important,” says Neha.
