JALPAIGURI: A 14-year-old girl was left traumatised after she was beaten up and stripped on the road in broad daylight by neighbours after a calf belonging to her family strayed into the neighbour’s paddy field and grazed on a portion of the standing crop. The incident happened at   in Jalpaiguri’s   on April 8. The traumatised girl has confined herself to the house and stopped speaking to everyone, including family members.

 A calf belonging to the girl’s father entered the paddy field of   Barman on April 8 and fed on some of the crop. Nanu caught the calf and secured it in his house. When the girl came looking for the calf and asked Nanu to release it, the latter refused.
 
 Nanu then called his aides and beat up the girl. She was dragged to the road and stripped. Terribly embarrassed, the girl lay crouched on the road in a foetal position for almost an hour before some people stepped forward to help.
 
 She was later admitted to Maynaguri hospital. A day later, she was transferred to   where she stayed for two days.
 
 But what appears to have scarred her more is the trauma of being stripped on the road in full view of locals. After retuning home, she has not spoken to anyone or stepped out of the house.
 
 Though Maynaguri police have registered a case under Sections 341, 328, 506 and 34 of IPC, the accused have not been apprehended. The girl’s father said her exams would start from Tuesday.
