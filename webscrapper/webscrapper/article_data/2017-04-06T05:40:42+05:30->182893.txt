AMRITSAR: The wire supporting India’s tallest   installed at   snapped just four days of its replacement on Tuesday evening. According to reports, the steel wire, which supports the flag, couldn’t bear pressure exerted on it by the flag fluttering at the height of 350feet, and broke down. Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha, who holds the additional charge of Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) chairman, said following the incident, he held a meeting with concerned officials of the department. He said a team of mechanics would arrive from Delhi to inspect and repair the flag.

 Since its inauguration on March 5, the flag has been replaced four times. About repeated incidents of the tallest national flag tearing, Sangha said he would also take up the issue with the government about its maintenance. Meanwhile, India’s tallest flag, which is also seen from  , is also a matter of debate in the newspapers of neighbouring country as the Pakistan Rangers had objected on the installing 350feet flagpole at the international border. Pakistan’s English daily “The Express Tribune”, in one of its news item published under the heading “How India’s tallest flag at Pakistan border keeps letting it do”, wrote, “India’s tallest flag, which towers over the border with Pakistan, keeps letting it down as it cannot stand up to the weather.”
 
 The paper has carried a picture of the flagpole sans the flag. It further wrote, “The flag, which was built with an aim to be seen from deep inside Indian territory, has been replaced for the fourth time since it has been hoisted as it keeps getting torn by the wind. Officials say that their country’s national pride is being dented and money wasted.” Earlier after the inauguration of the flag, a Pakistani newspaper had written that “Pakistan has raised concerns over India’s tallest ever flag being as an instrument for espionage.”
