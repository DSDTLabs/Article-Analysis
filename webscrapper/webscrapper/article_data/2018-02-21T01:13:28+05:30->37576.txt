NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed real estate major   on Tuesday to deposit an additional Rs 10 crore in the court for paying interest to homebuyers who have opted out of two towers Apex and Ceyane in the   housing complex in Noida.

 Amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal informed a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud that the Rs 20 crore deposited by Supertech earlier was exhausted in refunding the principal amount to 164 homebuyers who had opted out and sought refund of their money with interest.
 
 On April 12, 2014, the Allahabad high court had ordered the Noida administration to demolish the 40-storeyed ‘Apex’ and ‘Ceyane’ towers in ‘Emerald Court’ complex in Sector 93A on finding that the builder had “by joining hands with officers of the development authorities flouted every conceivable rule, including building regulations”. On appeal by Supertech, the SC had stayed demolition of the towers but had asked the builder to refund money to homebuyers.
 
 Appearing for homebuyers, advocates M Shoeb Alam and   pleaded with the bench to grant interest component on investments by all three categories of homebuyers — those who got refund from the SC registry through the amicus, the category which got refund from the registry after deduction of interest already paid by Supertech and the third category where the homebuyers were directly refunded by the realtor.
 
 The bench agreed and asked the amicus to compute interest due to homebuyers at simple interest rate of 12% per year for all three categories of homebuyers. It also took note of Supertech’s stand through senior advocate   and lawyer Keshav Mohan that the controversy could be put to rest by the SC by taking a final decision on the correctness of Allahabad HC’s decision to order demolition of the two towers. The SC posted the matter for April 16.
