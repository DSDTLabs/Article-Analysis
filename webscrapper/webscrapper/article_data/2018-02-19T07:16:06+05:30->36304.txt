SECUNDERABAD: Tension prevailed at   football ground on Sunday morning after   personnel forcibly sent off a few players, who play football and cricket there every Sunday.

 Players requested the Army personnel to allow them to practice for at least an hour as Sunday was holiday. However, their request was rejected and the Army personnel told them that the ground was meant for ‘military training’ and not for civilians.
 
 
  
 
 
 Angry locals protested at the ground against the Army personnel’s behaviour against the budding players.
 
 “About 50 players of nearby colonies reached the Trimulgherry ground around 7.15am to practice football and cricket. While we were playing, an Army official suddenly entered the ground and asked us to vacate the premises immediately.
 
 A senior Army official had apparently informed him that the players entered the military training area and have to be vacated,” B  , a local player, said.
 
 “In fact, last Sunday, the trainee soldiers also played with us, but now they forcibly sent us out,” he added.
 
 A senior defence official said since the   ( ) had put up a ‘Military Training Area’ signboard on the premises, it means civilians would not be allowed to play at the ground.
 
 Angry locals gathered in front of the ground and protested against the move by launching a ‘signature campaign’. Over 80 players supported the campaign. “We will not fight against the Army, but their attitude of not permitting budding players to practice football and cricket is unacceptable,”M  , a resident, said.
 
 “The signature poster will be forwarded to LMA. The protest will continue,” M Krishank of ’Save Bison Polo Ground’ campaign said.
 
 TIMES VIEW: The government should immediately begin a dialogue with the Army and mediate on behalf of the budding players. Until an alternate ground is found, the Army should allow the local players to continue practising football
