Dev massages Sona's shoulder and she shouts when she realises it's Dev. Bejoy and Asha hear her shout and rush towards her room. She lies it's a rat and asks them to go.
 
  Dev then sits for breakfast with Sona's family. Sona comes down after getting ready and Dev gets mesmerized. Bejoy asks everyone to start eating but Dev realises there's nothing vegetarian made for him.
  
  The doorbell rings. Dev gets happy to see Golu and Ishwari. Ishwari gets food for Dev. He takes the tiffin and serves everyone. Asha introduces Golu to everyone. Everyone starts eating together but Ishwari sits separately because of non-vegetarian food. While eating, Bejoy taunts Ishwari that they came uninvited. Ishwari leaves with Golu.
  
  
 
  
  Dev comes back angrily and confronts Bejoy that he can insult him but not his mother. He also tells him that after a week when Sona will be staying at his house, he wouldn't want them to visit her as well.
  
  Dev is fuming when Asha comes to him. He tells her that he didn't like Bejoy insulting his mother and how does she tolerate him. He then apologises to her for talking ill about Bejoy.
  
  Sona is angry and wants to confront Dev when she is stopped by Asha.
