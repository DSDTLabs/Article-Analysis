HYDERABAD: The cash-strapped Andhra Pradesh government has made a cool Rs 345 crore through the sale of precious   in the last two months, but it is still far from earning what it had hoped. The deadline to dispose of the logs, that were seized from smugglers over the years, is April 30 this year and the government still has 1,446 tonnes to sell.

 The sale of red sanders logs is prohibited under international law. But in 2013, the AP government obtained a one-time permission to auction 8,498.09 tonnes under a treaty with the Convention on   in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( ).
 
 In five auctions conducted subsequently , the government managed to dispose off 7,052 tonnes. This includes the latest auctions held in December 2016 and January 2017. The forest department had put up 2,800 tonnes for sale, of which it received successful bids worth Rs 344.85 crore ($5,15,05,292) for 1,136 tonnes in December. The e-bidding and e-auction were held on Dec 19, 21, 23, 27 and 29.
 
 In January , the government received bids for 218 tonnes worth Rs 95.96 lakh. However, these bids -for 161.088 tonnes on Jan 1 and 57.38 tonnes on Jan 3 -are yet to be finalised. Even if these bids are successful, the government will be left with 1,446 tonnes of red sanders to be auctioned off in 69 days.
 
 Given the current trend, the government is likely to make about Rs 400 crore by sel ling the leftover stock, making it close to 750 crore earned from auction of 2,800 tonnes. This is far less than the Rs 1,000 crore revenue it had hoped to garner two months ago. In the meantime, the seized red sanders logs are piling up in various forest depots in Rayalaseema.
 
 Red sanders, a  , thrives in the   in Kadapa and Chittoor districts. The deadline for the one-time auction permission has been extended six times since 2013, with the latest being in August 2016.
 
 This is the last chance for the Andhra Pradesh government to make money from the prized wood that has a huge demand in the international market, particularly in neighbouring country China.
