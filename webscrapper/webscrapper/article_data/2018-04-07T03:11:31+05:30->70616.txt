NEW DELHI: A Delhi court dropped a   case against   leader   after she apologised to plaintiff Amit Sibal, son of   leader Kapil Sibal. 

 An application was filed before additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal by both parties seeking withdrawal of the case.
 
 In a letter written to Amit, Ilmi expressed regret for the allegations made against him and his father. “I have learnt that the allegations made against you and your father at a press conference were unfounded. I hereby withdraw my statements and apologise for the same,” the letter read.
 
 The damage caused to the esteem, Ilmi added, besides the hurt caused to the family, friends and well-wishers, and the loss caused is regretted. 
 
 Meanwhile, Prashant Bhushan, who refused to furnish an apology and is also a party to the defamation case, sought its transfer saying, as the political leaders had been absolved following their apologies, the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the proceedings as it is designated to hear matters involving MLAs and MPs.
