 The court acted on a PIL that alleged unauthorised construction by Delhi Metro in the INA market was hampering free movement of traffic in south Delhi and also made the public road narrow.

 Earlier this month, TOI had highlighted that PWD wrote to DMRC saying that the structure — at the intersection of the Chandu Lal Balmiki Road and Aurobindo Road — has encroached upon the arterial road connecting Aurobindo Road with South Extension Part-I and NBCC’s Kidwai Nagar project. Following an inspection of the road by government officials in the first week of January, PWD wrote two letters to DMRC managing director Mangu Singh, asking the agency to immediately demolish a part of the structure.
