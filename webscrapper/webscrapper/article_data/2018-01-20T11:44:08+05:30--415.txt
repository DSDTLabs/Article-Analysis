RAJKOT: Alertness of a valve man saved scores of lives in Jira village, about 10 km from   town of Amreli,   

 Shailesh   (27), who works as a valve man in Jira village with population of about 2,000, was the first to notice some liquid floating on the water in a well, which is the main source of drinking water. Though the village gets   water through pipeline, it is very irregular and villagers have to depend on the water from the well, which is also supplied through network of pipelines.
 
 On Friday morning, Bagda before switching on the water pump to take water to the overhead tank, noticed some liquid on surface of the water in the well. He informed the sarpanch of Jira village  , who rushed to the well. The sample collected from the well confirmed presence of pesticide in water.
 
 “We were fortunate that Bagda noticed difference in well water. It was found that there was pesticide in it. Somebody may have mixed it in water at night. We also found a pesticide bag near the well,” Savaj told TOI. “We have registered a complaint with the village mamlatdar.”
 
 The sample of the water has been preserved for further investigation. Villagers alleged that somebody intentionally poisoned the water in the well.
