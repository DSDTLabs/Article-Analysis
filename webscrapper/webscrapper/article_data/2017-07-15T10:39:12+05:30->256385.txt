 Addressing the media, the minister said that he had informed chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and the revenue minister about the ongoing scam way back in 2014 and had also urged them to take action against the offenders. "I know Vineet Brijlal since his tenure in Narsipatnam. I have full faith on SIT. The government is focused on taking action against those involved in the scams irrespective of party affiliations," he said. "It is unbelievable that land grabbers even mortgaged roads and took 190 crore loans from banks. I will submit those details also," he added. 
 
 He further said that the land grabbers took compensation from the government by producing false documents regarding government land allotted for the proposed MedTech project at   mandal. "I wrote to the collector asking him to stop all payments and verify facts. But there was no response and payments were initiated," he alleged.
