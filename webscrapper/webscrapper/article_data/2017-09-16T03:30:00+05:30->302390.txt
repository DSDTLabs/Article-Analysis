Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has floated an Expression of Interest (EoI), inviting animal welfare organizations from all over the country to manage the sterilization and anti-rabies vaccination of stray dogs in the city. As per the EoI floated by NMC’s health department, it is mandatory for the organization to have recognition from the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). Apart from sterilization and vaccination, the organizations will also be responsible for providing treatment to sick and injured stray dogs, and keeping them under observation till recovery. “After recovery, the dogs should be sterilized and released in the same locality,” the tender said. The organizations will perform animal birth control (ABC) operations at the cost of Rs700 per dog. “The organization should have well-trained veterinarians having a minimum experience of two years in conducting ABC operations. To ensure transparency, they will have to preserve the reproductive organs removed during operations. After verification, the organs will be scientifically disposed of by concerned NMC officials,” said NMC veterinary officer Dr Ganjendra Mahalle. The civic body plans to set up five ABC centres in the city. Every centre will have a sub-committee to monitor the sterilization process. Close circuit television cameras (CCTV) will also be installed at the centres.
