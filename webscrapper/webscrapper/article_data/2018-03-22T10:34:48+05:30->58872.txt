PANAJI: Six days after   in Goa came to a complete stop,   Mining Corporation Ltd, a Vedanta group company, on Wednesday asked all its employees not to report for work with immediate effect.

 “We have asked all our 2,000 employees not to report to work to reduce operational costs of transportation and food. We have not laid off any employees and their salaries will be paid,” Sangeetha Chakravarthy, head of corporate communication for Sesa Goa Iron Ore, told TOI. However, she refused to comment whether the company would be laying off these employees or relocating them.
 
 In a communication to its employees, Sesa said it is beyond the control of the company to “continue the operations of the mines considering the   judgment” and instructions from the state government. “Hence, all employees have been advised not to report duty at mines with immediate effect until further notice,” the company said in a notice to its staff.
 
 The Supreme Court in its February 7 judgment suspended all mining operations with effect from March 16 until fresh mining leases and environmental clearances are granted.
 
 
 
 
 “To comply with the order of director of mines geology, we may need some critical and statutory manpower to carry out the dewatering for safety and security of mines. Those who are required to carry out the above jobs will be communicated individually. The allied services like canteen, transport will be stopped from tomorrow (Thursday),” the notice said.
 
 Sesa Goa Iron Ore is the country largest producer and exporter of iron ore in the private sector. Of the 37 working mining leases in the state, Sesa has 10 operational leases.
 
 Till March 15, nearly 11million tonnes of ore has been extracted. Mines department sources said of the 11 million tonnes, nearly 50% of it was extracted by Sesa. SC had capped iron ore production at 20 million tonnes per annum.
