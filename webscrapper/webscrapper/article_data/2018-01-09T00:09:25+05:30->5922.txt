Navi Mumbai: After TOI reported about the water wastage at the Laxmi Basahat in   (‘Potable water goes down the drain in Panvel, claim locals’, January 8) the PCMC   department officials reached the location on Monday morning. 

 The officials took steps to plug the water pipeline. However, the Munoth Empress building owner have objected to the demolition of a portion of the compound wall without which the Panvel civic officials cannot plug the water wastage spot.
 
 PCMC water supply department official, Avinash Patil said, “As instructed by our seniors, we had visited the   wastage area of the main water pipeline inside the Munoth Empress building leading to the gutter line at the Laxmi Basahat, Panvel. We need to raze a portion of the building compound wall and remove tiles and other structures to repair the pipeline.”
 
 However, Avinash Patil added, “The Munoth Empress building owner had objected to our demolishing the compound and asked for funds as cost for rebuilding the wall. The details has been shared with our seniors. We are awaiting the final order from them.”
 
 RTI activist Bharat Jadhav said, “Many residents of the area have pointed out to the   inspection team that water tankers are illegally filling and transporting water from the area.”
 
 Many Laxmi Basahat residents demanded that the PCMC should check the entire stretch of underground water pipeline.
 
 The locals also questioned the intent of frequent movements of water tankers that too close to the elevated storage reservoir behind the ST depot, when water is available in plenty. Patil said, “We do not have any information about this issue.”
