KOLKATA: Cargo movement along a number of national and state highways close to Kolkata, including   and National Highway 34, will be greatly reduced with the commissioning of dumb-barges, which were flagged off by secretary, ministry of shipping,   from IWAI’s GR Jetty in   on Saturday.

 The first of its kind in India, these can move with the least draft (depth) of 2.2m. Each barge can carry goods from 50 trucks. From NTPC, Farakka to Bangladesh, a truck needs 10 days to reach its destination after customs clearance. But the barge will take only seven days, reducing transportation cost, decongesting roads and decreasing the city’s pollution load. “These barges will carry fly ash from Farakka and Kahelgaon power plant to Ashugunj in Bangladesh, where it is in high demand for cement manufacturing,” Krishna said.
 
 “These barges were built here with design help from Germany. We have awarded the assured draft dredging of 147km from Farakka to Kahelgaon to ensure 3m navigable depth throughout the year,” said Pravir Pandey, IWAI vice-chairman and project director, NW-1, which involves a Rs 5369-crore loan from World Bank.
