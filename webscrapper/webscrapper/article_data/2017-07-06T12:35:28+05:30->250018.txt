MUMBAI: After Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Istanbul, the US has now lifted the electronic gadgets ban on flights from Doha. It's a significant development for Qatar which was blacklisted by its neighbours last month which cut off air links on the allegations that it supported terrorism. 

 A statement issued by   on Thursday morning said that passengers travelling from   to destinations in the United States can carry their personal electronic devices on board.
 
 In the last week of March, the US administration had imposed a ban on carriage of personal electronic items, bigger than a mobile phone, onboard flights in carry on baggage. 
 
 Last week it lifted the ban on flights that depart from Abu Dhabi and it was followed by those from Dubai and Istanbul, providing a huge relief to passengers from India who fly to the US on board these carriers with a transit halt at these affected airports. 
 
 "All personal electronic devices can be carried on board all departures from Hamad International Airport to destinations in the United States. Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport have met with all requirements of the US Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s new security guidelines and we would like to express our thanks to the US and local authorities for their support during this process," the Qatar statement said.
