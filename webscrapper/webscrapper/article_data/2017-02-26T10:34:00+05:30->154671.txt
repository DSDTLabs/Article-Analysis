NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) election results saw 60% of the total candidates losing their security deposit, which is considered a humiliating defeat. Of the total 1,135 candidates, 678 failed to get even 1,700-2,700 votes from the total voting of 21,000-34,000 in their respective wards.

 The civic body has forfeited bank guarantee of Rs 2,500 of these 678 candidates. Some big names in the city’s political field are in the list.
 
 Three-time corporator Rahul Telang from North Nagpur contested from ward No. 6 and secured only 1,670 of the total 30,701 votes to lose his bank guarantee. A follower of former minister Sulekha Kumbhare, Telang switched over to RPI (Khoripa) from BREM as the latter allied with  .
 
 Similarly, sitting BJP corporator Vishaka Maind faced a humiliating defeat from ward No. 15 as she contested as an independent candidate rebelling against the saffron party. She got 1,579 of the total 30,014 votes. Wife of BJP senior leader Baba Maind, she got elected unopposed in the 2012 NMC elections.
 
 Some prominent personalities who also lost their security deposit include   city president Mangesh Kashikar who contested against BJP city general secretary Sandip Joshi from ward No. 16. He secured 1,734 of the total 31,077 votes.
 
 Shripad Risaldar, a RSS senior swayamsewak, too is among the list. He contested from ward No. 19 against NMC ruling party leader Dayashankar Tiwari and secured 1,132 of the total 30,158 votes.
 
 Well-known for saving many people from drowning at the Gandisagar Lake, Jagdish Khare too found his place in the dubious list as he secured just 440 of the total 33,010 votes from ward No. 17 from where BJP’s   won. Social activist   contested as NCP candidate from ward No. 17 and finished securing only 876 of the total 33,010 votes. Here BJP’s Lata Kadgaye was the winner.
 
 One of the major reasons behind the long list of forfeiters is a direct fight between BJP and Congress in a majority of the 151 seats. In some seats, there was a fight between BJP and   or Congress and BSP.
 
 No BJP and Congress candidates forfeited their security deposit. Though the BSP candidates performed poorly, many of them escaped a humiliating defeat. One of BSP candidates who secured below 1,000 votes was Latif Sheikh from ward No 30.
 
 Other major political parties like NCP, Shiv Sena and MNS miserably failed to secure reasonable votes and saw many of its candidates’ bank guarantee forfeited. NCP candidate from ward No. 38 Shakuntala Chaudhary got 100 of a total 22,777 votes polled. Similarly, Shiv Sena candidate from ward No. 10 Nattu Tikle got 380 of total 23,614 votes.
 
 Even, candidates of small political parties could not escape from humiliating defeat. Probably a the one who got the lowest votes, RPI (Khoripa) candidate from ward no. 1 Asangh Ramteke got 46 of total 31,106 votes.
 
 The situation was no different for independent candidates. An independent candidate from ward No. 9 Pankaj Bodele got 54 of the total 26,151 votes.
