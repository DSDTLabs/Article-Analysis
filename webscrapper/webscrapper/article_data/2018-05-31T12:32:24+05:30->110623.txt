HYDERABAD: Two girls — Shristi Porwal and S   — from   in the city, made Hyderabad proud by securing all-India first and second ranks (among KVs in India) in the   (CBSE) class 10 exam. Porwal, a student of KV, AFS, Begumpet, shared the first spot with two other students, Zainub Iqubal from Punjab and Alisha Uvais from  , with all three scoring 98.8%.

 
 Elated with the outcome, Porwal said she has always put quality learning over quantity learning. “I studied for five to six hours every day. Since the syllabus was vast, I divided it into portions and followed a regular schedule. I was totally depended on textbooks and solved sample papers on a regular basis,” said Porwal, who secured a perfect 100 in social studies and Sanskrit, 99 in maths, 98 in English and 97 in science.
 
 Given her keen interest in Mathematics, she plans to pursue a degree in engineering eventually.
 
 But unlike the topper, Anusri, a student of KV, University of Hyderabad (UoH) campus, followed a rigorous study schedule of 12-13 hours a day. “Before the exams, I revised the syllabus two to three times. While I was expecting a good score, I have secured 4-5 marks (overall) more than what I expected,” said Anusri, who scored 98.6% with 100 in social studies, 98 in maths, 99 in Hindi and science and 97 in English. She shared the second spot with eight students from other KVs.
 
 Following in her parents’ footsteps, Anusri plans to pursue a degree in research studies. “My father pursued a PhD in physics and my mother has a PhD in biology. I want to pursue PhD in maths as that’s my favourite subject,” said the teenager, who is also a painter and has won 42 prizes since class 1.
