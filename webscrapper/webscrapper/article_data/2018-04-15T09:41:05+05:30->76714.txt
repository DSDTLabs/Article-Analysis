Mohali: Chennai Super Kings have been enjoying a dream return to the Indian Premier League ( ) fold.   won their first two games against Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders off the penultimate ball of the match. 

 
 The Yellow Brigade is now in Mohali to take on Kings XI Punjab in their third game of this season. Kings are coming off a loss to Royal Challengers Bangalore in their last match, but they won their first game against Delhi Daredevils at the IS Bindra PCA Stadium here.
 
 Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming was disappointed to leave Chennai as their venue. “We are very disappointed to leave Chennai. We sat in the auction to pick a team that was based on the conditions in Chennai, and therefore we are disappointed to get only one home game. Making our home venue a fortress for us was going to be a big part of our strategy this year. But we have to adjust. That’s part of the IPL. We just need to keep scrapping,” said Fleming on the eve of the game.
 
 He was happy the way the team has shown fight in its first two games. “I guess the positive is we’ve had two wins in two. They haven’t been great performances; but the lads have shown good character and most importantly they have been fighting wins, which sometimes at the start of the tournament is more valuable,” said Fleming. 
 
 CSK’s top gun Suresh Raina won’t be playing the match against Kings XI. Fleming acknowledged that Raina’s loss is a massive one, but the other Indian players in the team have to step up a gear.
