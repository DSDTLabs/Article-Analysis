CHENNAI: Conservationists were in for a shock on Wednesday night when 22 carcasses of Olive Ridley turtles washed up along the Chennai coastline from   to Neelankarai.

 One of the volunteers of Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN)   said, “Only this year so many dead turtles in one night. The number of nests were also very low this season. In January only 24 nests were sighted by volunteers,” he said.   believes the main reason for turtle deaths is the use of gill nets by fishermen. Turtles get caught in this net and are suffocated to death. 
 
 Denying this allegation,   president   said gill nets are floating nets permitted by the government. “Not all the turtle carcass that get washed ashore along the Chennai coast are caught in the nets. In the past five months, the number of boats going out for fishing has come down drastically. So how can the fishermen be blamed for turtle deaths,” he said.
 
  department director   said the more harmful bottom trawling and purse seine and pair nets have been banned. He explained that the government has introduced the turtle excluding device (TED) to ensure turtles are not harmed during fishing, but not many use them. “When this device is used along with the net, a good portion of the fish catch escapes through the gap along with the turtle complain fishermen. So we have asked the forest department whether it is possible to add a pouch in the device so that the fish can stay, when the turtle escape from it,” he said.
 
  While fishermen try to shift the blame from themselves, the forest department has taken no action yet to look into the cause of the death of so many olive ridley turles. In the absence of a postmortem and investigation, the reason for death is difficult to be establish and take measures for conservation work.
