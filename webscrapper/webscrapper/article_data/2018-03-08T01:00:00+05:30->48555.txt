And on March 6, when Janhvi turned 21, knowing that she is missing her mother, the Kapoor khandaan came together to spend time with her.

A source close to the Kapoor family told BT, “Boney wanted Janhvi to feel good on her birthday, especially since he knew she was missing her mother. Even before he could act on his thoughts, Anshula took charge and planned a get-together to make Janhvi feel special. Her gesture made Boney even more emotional about the beautiful bond the girls share today. Anshula organised a family-only gathering at her house, where she also invited the rest of the Kapoor family, including cousins Sonam, Rhea and Shanaya for a meal. They cut cakes for Janhvi and sang the birthday song.”   was not present as he is shooting out of town for his next film.
 
 While there was an outpour of love and warmth at home, Janhvi made it a point to do what her mother always did for Khushi and her on their birthdays. Every year, Sridevi would visit an orphanage with her daughters on the occasion. This year too, taking forward their mom’s tradition, Janhvi went to the same orphanage and spent time with the children there.
 
 On March 5, Janhvi’s close friends also dropped by at home at midnight to ring in her birthday, making it even more special.
