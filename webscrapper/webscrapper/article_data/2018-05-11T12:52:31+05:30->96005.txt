With election campaigning having hit fever pitch in the past few days, city roads have been jammed due to political rallies. However, Bengaluru traffic police have stopped posting traffic congestion updates on their Twitter and Facebook accounts since the poll code of conduct came into effect.

 
 “Many of our tweets and Facebook posts have been subjected to trolling and even used for political mudslinging. We have refrained from posting on social media websites till elections get over,” said a senior traffic police officer.
 
 Earlier, some netizens had said that issuing traffic advisories ahead of political rallies would indirectly give publicity to political parties. Traffic police said they are now posting general road-safety awareness messages on their social media pages. “We are also responding to individual traffic-related complaints,” said a cop.
 
 However, some motorists are unhappy. “Traffic police messages used to help us plan our journey and take a detour, if needed, in case of congestion due to a political rally or meeting,” said  , a motorist from Koramangala.
