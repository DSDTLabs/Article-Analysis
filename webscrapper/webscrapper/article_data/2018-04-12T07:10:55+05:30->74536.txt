BENGALURU: The government assured the high court on Wednesday that it will take all measures to ensure   remains unaffected in the event of a bandh. A S Ponnanna, additional advocate general, made the submission before a division bench headed by chief justice Dinesh Maheshwari, that was hearing a batch of petitions relating to the proposed bandh on April 12.

 Counsel for the petitioners had informed the court that the bandh — against setting up of the Cauvery River Management Board — was tentatively postponed to May 3, depending on the Supreme Court ruling on the issue. The HC ordered the state government to file a proper statement and set April 26 as the next hearing. The court refused to pass any order, pointing out that it had already issued one pertaining to the February 4 Bengaluru bandh.
 
 While dealing with a petition relating to the February 4 band called by pro-Kannada outfits over the Mahadayi river water issue, the HC had given specific directions to the state. The directions were based on a SC verdict and, among other instructions, restrained those who had called for the bandh from proceeding with it. tnn
