KOZHIKODE: Writer T Padmanabhan said that   Law College in Thiruvananthapuram was controlled by a family flouting all the laws of the land. Speaking at an interaction with   MA Baby, as part of the Kerala Literature Festival, here on Friday he said those who spoke eloquently on dalit and student issues at JNU and   are remaining silent on the developments at the Law Academy. 

 At the Law Academy, a student was insulted by calling his caste name. But unlike in the case of Rohit Vemula the student did not go the extreme step of committing suicide. "Is that the reason for the silence," asked the writer.
 
 He added that the Law Academy was controlled by a family trust. "We are apprehensive of the trusts. There is a trust in Tirur too, he said. Padmanabhan maintained that MT was wrongly branded as anti-Sangh Parivar. He said that the BJP was targeting film director Kamal and made a passing reference to MT. But MT fans celebrated it by making it a big issue," he said. 
 
 MT only made a casual reference to Tughlaq while releasing a book by TM Thomas Isaac. "But I criticised Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat," added the writer.
