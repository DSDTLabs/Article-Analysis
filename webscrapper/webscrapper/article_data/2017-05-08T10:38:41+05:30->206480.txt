PUNE: There is a need to bring 50% of cultivable land under irrigation in Maharashtra to check agrarian crisis and farmer suicides, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari said here on Sunday. 

 The minister said the state has managed to bring only 18% of its cultivable land under irrigation so far. "Maharashtra is among the lowest ranking   in this regard. States like   and   have achieved more than 50% mark already. Farmer suicides can be stopped if more land is assured with irrigation facilities," he said, while speaking at a function organised by the  .
 
 At the function, Gadkari felicitated the Jankalyan Samiti's   (unit) with the   for its contribution in the field of water conservation. 
 
 "The Centre has come out with a plan for 11 states, including Maharashtra, to increase water availability by implementing water conservation and irrigation projects," the minister said.
 
 On the conservation of rainwater, Gadkari said, "Only 15% of rainwater gets stored in ponds or dams and an equal part seeps through the soil increasing the groundwater level," he added.
 
 Gadkari said the state governments have a major role to play in water conservation. "Some states have recently increased water allocation for irrigation. Maharashtra needs to follow suit and should also adopt drip irrigation practices to avoid water wastage," he said.
 
 The minister said the government was working on a project to develop waterways (Jal-marg) in 111 rivers in the country. Work has been started at 10 rivers, of which one river is from Maharashtra, Gadkari said.
