MUMBAI: Problems with the  's website server continued for the third consecutive day as many students failed to fill their exams forms even on Wednesday. The official website ( ) was down since Monday, when hundreds of students tried to log in to either download their hall-tickets or to fill their exam forms. 

 
 Though university officials claimed to have fixed the problem on Tuesday, students found the server was extremely slow even on the third day. Many students took to social media to lodge their complaint.
 
 An engineering student claimed that he was unable to submit his exam form for the last four days and posted the error message on Twitter - 'Oops! There may be an error in your input. Requested page not found. Another production engineering student cited the same problem. "The engineering form is available and can be filled but each time anyone clicks on the submit button there is this error message" said another student. On Tuesday, several students filling the MMS ( ), MA forms too faced similar problems.
 
 A BMM student who had been trying to download her hall-ticket for two days in a row, finally had to seek her college's help on Tuesday as her exam was scheduled to commence on Wednesday.
 
 A university official said that the traffic on the site has increased as too many activities were going on simultaneously. "Students were downloading hall-tickets, filling exam forms. Forms of at least six to seven courses were made available online at the same time. The server did not crash, but it was just slow. Our officials have added servers to reduce the problem," said the official.
