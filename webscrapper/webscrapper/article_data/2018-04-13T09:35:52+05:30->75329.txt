The Sikh community in Kolkata has urged the state government to take steps to prevent the release of ' ', a movie in which the portrayal of Guru Nanak and his family members has hurt the sentiments of the community, in the state.

 The movie was not scheduled to release in Kolkata or any other part of the state anyway. None of the multiplexes or standalone cinema halls has any shows scheduled for Friday. 
 
 Member of more than 10 Sikh organisations in the city met at the Shahid Minar Ground for deliberations after which they submitted a memorandum to Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi. The representatives of the community will also write to chief minister  .
 
 “We express great disdain and displeasure at the news of the release and screening of film Nanak Shah Fakir. The screening of the film is completely against the religious sentiments of the Sikhs,” the community has said in a memorandum to Governor Tripathi.
 
  “West Bengal has been very sensitive about the minority communities that reside in the state. The government has always supported us in all aspects. It is our earnest request to you to take steps against the release of the film and take measures to stop any untoward incident from taking place,” the memorandum states.
 
 Earlier this week the Supreme Court directed the Centre, the   (CBFC), the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) and all state governments to ensure that the film is released across the country on April 13.
 
 Several Sikh organisations are objecting to the portrayal of Guru Nanak in the film, saying any on-screen depiction of a Sikh guru or his family members was against the tenets of Sikh religion.
 
 “The film also shows idol worship which is against the tenets of Sikhism. These factors have hurt the sentiments of the community. Honourable Governor heard our plea and assured us that he will forward our letter to the people concerned in the administration,” said  , the president of Sri Singh Sabha.
