NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday announced a Rs 300 crore action plan for bringing “visible improvement” in municipal waste management in  . Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the three municipal corporations will buy Rs 100 crore each for procuring 549 modern machines for better collection, transport and storage of garbage, decentralised treatment and better maintenance of sewers and drains.

 “This initiative will quickly add a waste treatment capacity of 670 metric tonnes of bio-degradable waste besides preventing release of foul gases, smell and proliferation of germs, pathogens, pests etc,” an official release issued by the ministry said.
 
 As per the plan, the ministry will provide assistance of Rs 80 crore each to the three municipal bodies from the urban development fund. The municipal entities will have to put up another Rs 20 crore each as their share and all equipments including treatment plants are to be procured and commissioned by the end of this year.
 
 According to ministry officials, 422 litter pickers including battery-operated ones for market area will be procured by the municipalities under this scheme and 11 mechanical sweepers will be put to use. Moreover, 20 accelerated composters, 15 bio-methanation plants and 20 super sucker recycler machines and suction-cum-jetting machines will be bought.
 
 Soon after assuming office, Puri had raised the issue of garbage problem in the national capital during a discussion on Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) in the ministry early this month and had asked for an action plan for improving the situation.
 
 Puri had said the garbage mess in Delhi is unacceptable adding that the daily reports of garbage mess in newspapers sends a depressing message to everyone in Delhi
 
 Delhi generates about 10,000 tonnes of municipal waste everyday and only 50% of it is processed.
