It is only human to want more from life. We love two-for-the-price-of-one deals, or appliances that can multi-task. It makes us feel like we are getting value for our money, while at the same time saving us some effort or time. Some health foods can also multi-task, by protecting the body from more than one health problem. One such food is barley, which was already known to be an excellent source of fibre and protein, and was more recently shown to reduce the levels of two kinds of “bad”  .

 The study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, included a review of data from 14 randomized clinical trials that were conducted in seven countries. The study examined the effects of barley on low density   (LDLs) and non-HDL cholesterol, as well as Apo-lipoprotein B (Apo-B), a cholesterol carrier protein, all of which constitute the “bad” cholesterol in the blood. The results of the analysis demonstrated that barley reduced the levels of “bad” cholesterol particularly in patients who were at high risk of heart disease, such as type 2 diabetics, whose   levels are usually within normal ranges but whose non-HDL cholesterol and Apo-B levels are elevated. While barley is believed to have cholesterol-lowering effects comparable to oats (which is another cereal recommended for people with elevated cholesterol), this was the first study to show that barley in fact helps in the reduction of two types of “bad” cholesterol. While oats are more widely consumed, barley is not a staple part of the diets of people with weight and cholesterol concerns. The fiber and protein in barley exceed the amounts present in oats, while oats contain nearly twice the calories found in barley, suggesting that barley may be a better option to be considered for weight- and cholesterol-control. 
 
 Since barley is twice as good for the body, go grab a bowl (or two) of the cereal right away!
