HYDERABAD: A mysterious sinkhole in   in Moula Ali, which revealed some concrete structures inside, was closed off unceremoniously by the   as the officials from the   (ASI) failed to turn up to check it out.The sinkhole was formed over a week ago near the compound wall of a house. “First we thought that bandicoots had dug through the ground. But we were surprised to see a concrete construction inside. As this is a hilly area and has historical prominence, I was eager to know about the structures inside,“ said Rajender K, an passerby. The   area has a lot of cairns. A few people also surmised that the hole could be part of an underground escape route during the time of  . GHMC officials said the construction could be identified only after the cavity is dug further. But that was not to be.

 After contacting the ASI, GHMC officials waited for a while. But when no one turned up, they closed the hole.“We left the hole open for a week by temporarily barricading it and contacted ASI through telephone, but they did not turn up. If a commuters falls into it, GHMC will be blamed and if we choose to dig further there are chances the concrete construction might be damaged," said Anil Raj, GHMC executive engineer of the area.
