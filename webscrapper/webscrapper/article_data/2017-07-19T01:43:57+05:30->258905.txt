MUMBAI: The DRI investigating the case of courier services being used for   has learnt that the accused, Muzaffar Parvez Pawaskar, brought around 50kg of   in the last two years.

 DRI officials on Monday raided Pawaskar’s import-export office,   (GTC), in Dongri and seized some documents, including two airway bills and unsigned indemnity letters on the firm’s letterhead that had stamped authorization for custom clearance.
 
 “Based on the bills, which were in the name of GTC, we searched the Byculla office of a courier service company. We carried a detail search of two boxes that had tools—a rotary hammer and two wrenches—in it. On dismantling the tools, we found nine pieces of gold in one box and eight in another box, collectively weighing 12.8kg, which is worth Rs 3.20 crore,” said a DRI official.
 
 During the course of investigation, it was found that the gold was imported by   (25) and his father Yusuf Kalva. Pawaskar, Mustafa and his assistant   have been arrested. Yusuf, who is based in Dubai, is absconding. The Kalva family runs a chain of motorcycle showrooms in Mumbai.
 
 Officials said that the accused would conceal gold bars inside toolboxes and machine parts. The consignment originated from Dubai, was sent to London and then couriered to India. Mustafa has told DRI officials that his father would buy gold from in Dubai and send it to a friend in London who couriered it to Mumbai. 
 
 DRI officials raided GTC’s Sewri office and found 50 toolboxes which were used to smuggle gold in the past. “From the documents, it seems the accused has smuggled 50kg gold in two years,” said an officer. Mustafa used Pawaskar’s import export code to get the gold in the city.
