ALLAHABAD: As the   polls draw closer, political parties are trying to up the fun quotient with quirky slogans as they try to expand their voter base. 

 Apart from manifestos and promises, rhyming slogans are an instantaneous hit among Allahabad voters. Right from Congress’s ‘UP ko ye sath pasand hai (UP likes Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance)’, which seems to be inspired from the hit Bollywood track ‘baby ko bass pasand hai’ to Bahujan Samaj Party’s ‘Ab badlaav majboori hai, UP mei behenji zaroori hai (Change is inevitable, behenji is necessary in UP)’, parties are leaving no stone unturned to draw the voters’ attention. 
 
 Supporters are also using some of these slogans to take a dig at rival parties. For instance, taking a pot shot at the newly-forged Congress-SP alliance,   supporters have coined in a new slogan – ‘Kaisa virodh, kaisi ladai, chor-chor ab mausere bhai’. Similarly, BSP‘s ‘Sarvajan hitaye sarvajan sukhaye, jumle vaadon mei na ayein’, takes a jibe on the saffron party. 
 
 “Interaction with voters is must and once you interact with voters, you can know their problems or grievances properly,” said a candidate in fray, on condition of anonymity. 
 
 Some BJP members in the district have taken to slogans to ridicule   on the issue of misgovernance and lawlessness. With catchy slogans like ‘Gunde satta mein bhaagidaar, nahi chahiye aisi sarkaar’ and ‘Jisne kiya ghotale hazaar, nahin chahiye aisi sarkar’ BJP workers are garnering support for the party on social media.
 
 Moreover, the contest among opposite political parties seems to have intensified with ‘pole khol’ and ‘chaupal’ (public meeting). Organising public meetings seems to be the latest fad among the candidates of political parties to establish a direct connect with voters.
