BENGALURU: The   accident, in which five persons were killed in the wee hours of Monday, could have been averted had there been a second exit door in the commercial establishment, said state home minister R Ramalinga Reddy.

 Speaking to reporters after visiting the spot in city’s Kalasipalya area, Reddy said, "Preliminary investigations have revealed that the bar had only one entrance. The victims are all employees of the bar. They could not come out as the fire had broke out near the entrance around 2.30 am, they were trapped as there was no fire exit or a second door. While two of the victims died because of the burns they had suffered three died because of asphyxiation." 
 
  
  
 
 Suspecting short-circuit to be the reason behind fire, Reddy said, “Investigation is on and we will soon get a clear picture.” 
 
 The minister directed the fire services department to review implementation of fire safety norms in all commercial establishments across the city. “Rules make it mandatory for all commercial establishments to install fire extinguishers and take fire safety measures. We have to check if this bar had any fire extinguishers,” Reddy said. He said the excise department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be ordered to check for fire safety norms during renewal of licenses.
