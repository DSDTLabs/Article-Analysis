NEW DELHI: A US citizen suffering from cancer is set to approach the   on the   issue.

 Harjot   had first moved the Delhi high court seeking relief on the ground that despite the RBI assurance, she was not given any assistance in exchanging her old notes to the tune of Rs 92,000. 
 
 Through advocates Maldeep Sidhu and  , the woman, who is an NRI having an OCI card, informed the court that she holds a US passport and lives there.
 
 She also owns a property in Delhi for which she frequently visits the capital. “It is pertinent to mention that the petitioner is a cancer patient and undergoing regular treatment in the US. She was in the US from the date the currency was demonetised until her arrival here on February 4, 2017, as is evident from her passport,” her plea added, while seeking relief from HC.
 
  “The government cannot discriminate and treat NRI’s differently and more so in case of NRI’s holding OCI cards. This treatment is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,” Kaur’s plea in HC argued, praying for its intervention and directions to the RBI to exchange her old currency.
 
 However, standing counsel for the Centre   informed the court that her plea can’t be entertained since the SC has already clarified that no other court shall entertain, hear or decide any writ petition/proceedings on the issue.
