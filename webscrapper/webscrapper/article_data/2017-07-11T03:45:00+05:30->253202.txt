Nagpur: Deficient rainfall in June and first week of July has forced a good number of farmers in Nagpur division to take up resowing of seeds in the hope of making it up in the remaining part of the kharif season. The situation is no different in western Vidarbha’s Amravati division where rains are not scattered. The agriculture department had cautioned farmers through its advisory that they should not rush to complete sowing in June and wait for a few consecutive rainy days. But not all farmers went by it. “We relied on the initial forecast of a good monsoon this year and did the sowing in third week of June after a shower or two. But it was a mistake. This week we had to take up another round sowing,” said Jeetu Patil, who has farm land in Hingna tehsil and runs a grocery shop in city’s Gandhinagar locality. Venu Parteki, who has 16 acres in Amravati district, said her family did sowing but the groundnut seeds dried up and were eaten up by ants in the field during the long dry spell. Now, they have to till the land again and do sowing afresh. They are still waiting for regular rainfall. Meanwhile, the reservoirs of major and medium irrigation projects are showing no signs of filling up. Data issued by water resources department on Monday said the total water volume in 18 major dams in Nagpur division had barely risen to 12% of their designed capacity. Last year, the water stock at this period in the 18 dams was at 29%. The rainfall received this season in the catchment area is barely 190mm as compared to 331mm recorded last year in same period. Similarly, the 40 medium irrigation projects in the division have filled up to 12% of the capacity as on Monday. Last year in the same period, the storage had swelled to 31%.
