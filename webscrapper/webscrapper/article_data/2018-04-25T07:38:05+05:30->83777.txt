PATNA: The state transport department on Tuesday launched a drive to penalise those found guilty of using   while driving vehicles. “A fine of Rs 100 will be slapped on those caught using cellphones while driving. The repeat offenders will have to pay Rs 300,” transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said.

 To begin with, 5,000 vehicles were covered across the state on Tuesday and 2,800 people fined.
 
 “Surprise inspections were carried out at Dak Bungalow crossing, Kargil Chowk and Bypass road in the state capital. As per section 184 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, whoever drives a vehicle in a manner that is dangerous to the public shall be held liable for an act of recklessness,” Agarwal said.
 
 Asked if those found talking on the phone using Bluetooth or the hands-free system in a car would also be penalised, Agarwal said the law wants to put a complete stop to use of phones while driving as it distracts the driver. “The distraction makes the person unable to timely react to a situation where an object appears suddenly in front of them while driving. One out of four road accidents is caused due to distractions by cellphones in the country,” he said.
 
 “The state has over 50 lakh registered vehicles. Altogether 18 lakh vehicles (all types) had been registered in the state between 2016 and 2018 alone,” Agarwal said. 
 
 According to a data available with state police headquarters, altogether 35,579 people died and 48,543 others were injured in around 70,000 road accidents across the state between 2010 and 2016.
 
 Meanwhile, the department also carried out a statewide drive against helmetless driving on Tuesday and penalised those riding two-wheelers without wearing a helmet.
