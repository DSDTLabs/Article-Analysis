 Elangovan, who was in Puducherry on Thursday, also requested the   to disqualify Dhinakaran from contesting R K Nagar bypoll for indulging in corrupt practices. He pointed out that roughly 100 supporters of Dhinakaran were caught red-handed attempting to distribute money to voters in the constituency.
 
 He regretted that the Election Commission of India could not ensure conduct of free and fair election despite launching several initiatives, including transferring officials and roping in central paramilitary forces. "It has been now proved that voters are bribed. More than 100 people were arrested (for bribing voters). All the 100 people were found to be supporters of Dhinakaran. Hence Dhinakaran must be arrested and disqualified from contesting the bypoll," he said. TNN
