BATHINDA:   , the gunman of Punjab   who shot himself in the head with his service revolver on Monday afternoon, died late on Tuesday evening after doctors failed to extract the bullet that hit him near his eye after passing through Sandhu’s head.

 Lal Singh, 47, was admitted to the intensive care unit after he and Sandhu were rushed to hospital on Monday afternoon by cops accompanying them. Fifty-year-old Sandhu was declared dead on arrival.
 
 The doctors at   in Faridkot were unsuccessful in pulling out the bullet from Lal Singh’s face. Faridkot SSP Nanak Singh confirmed that “the bullet could not be pulled out of the body of Lal Singh.”
 
 An ex-serviceman, Lal Singh had joined the Punjab police as a constable in 2011. He belonged to Kot Sukhiya village in Faridkot and is survived by his wife and a 12-year-old daughter.
 
 Sandhu accompanied by Lal Singh and other cops had gone to the Punjabi University’s regional centre in Jaito, Faridkot, to pacify students taking part in a protest that had started after some of their fellow students were allegedly harassed by cops at a bus stand in Jaito on January 23 for “no apparent reason”.
 
 
 
 
 
 While the protest was on, another group of students arrived on the spot and tried to disrupt the gathering. “Activists of Inquilabi Vidyarthi Manch accused the police of favouring students who were trying to disrupt their protest. Upset with the allegation and unable to take the stress, the officer shot himself,” said Bathinda zone IG M S Chhina.
 
 The police on Monday had booked unidentified students for abetting the suicide as they believe that the students provoked the police officer into taking his life. After Lal Singh’s death, the Faridkot SSP said, no extra section had been added to the FIR. “The case remains same which was registered yesterday under charges of abetment of suicide and no arrest has been made so far,” he added.
