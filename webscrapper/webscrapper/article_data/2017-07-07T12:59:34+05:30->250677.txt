 
Bijal Joshi, who is making her debut with   'never wanted to become an actor'. From MBA to editing to assisting directors in a couple of projects — acting just happened to her. And, if this is not enough — this pretty girl's creative interests are still not coming to a halt and she turns producer for two telly projects. 
 
 She says, "I am producing two Hindi shows — one is   which is a horror show and another one is cop-diaries based  . All these things and acting along with promoting the movie is keeping me on my toes. I guess I am the youngest telly producer (laughs) — no actually that would be Ekta Kapoor! " Bijal shares that being the part of technical team has made her more responsible as an actor, "I know if I give a wrong take, it is going to waste so much of production time and money -- that is one learning my direction and editing lessons have taught me."
