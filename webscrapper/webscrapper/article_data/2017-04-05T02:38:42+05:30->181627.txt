NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Parents’ associations in Noida and Ghaziabad have welcomed the UP government’s plan to pass an ordinance to regulate the fee structure in private schools.

 Both registered and informal associations of parents have been fighting the private schools’ fee hikes in the past few years in the region although there has been no unified fight against the schools by a single representative group of parents.
 
 Most parents have formed WhatsApp groups to decide a schedule of meetings among themselves or between them and the school managements to discuss the   issue.
 
 Parents, whose children study in schools such as The  , Sector 40; DPS Sector 132; and Cambridge School, Sector 27; have formed groups to connect with one another. 
 
 They have also started tweeting their woes to newly elected chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi with #noidaschoolfeehike trending on Twitter.
 
 As reported by TOI on Tuesday, the ordinance aims to institute a committee in all districts to enforce the provisions of the ordinance. Members of this district committee will be empowered to visit any school at any time and examine the accounts of the school.
 
 “This is a long-awaited move. If this takes shape, our future generations will be safe from the painfully hefty charges which the private schools are charging on the pretext of annual fee, caution fee, development fee, technology fee, etc,” said  , two of whose children study in Apeejay School Noida, Sector 16A.
 
 However, the parents want their representative to be part of the fee-regulating committee. Ritu Lal, who has been resisting the 14% fee hike by DPS Sector 132, said, “We the parents, who have been fighting the schools all these years, know firts-hand if the fee amount is really proportionate to the facilities being provided. Hence, it makes sense to have a parent representative in the committee.”
