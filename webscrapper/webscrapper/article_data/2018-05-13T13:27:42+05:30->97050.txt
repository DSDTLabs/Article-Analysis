Palanpur: Four years after 13-year-old son of a businessman in Thara town of   was kidnapped and murdered, a court in Deesa sentenced two people to life imprisonment and four to seven years jail for the crime.

 Additional district and session judge D B Bardot sentenced to life Mehul Prajapati and Mala Masa Rabari, who had abducted and murdered   Shah when he was on his way to the tuition class on March 25, 2014. Their accomplices in the crime — Vinubha Vaghela, Bakaji Thakore, Ashokji Thakore and Jenti Thakor, all from Thara, were sentenced to seven years imprisonment, counsel for Jainam’s father B A   said.
 
 The government had retained a well-known pleader S M Modi as the special prosecutor. 
 
 Jainam was kidnapped from near Ramji Mandir in Thara town of Kankrej taluka and his body was fished out from Narmada canal on March 29 evening. The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh from his father Trilokchand Shah, a trader and son of former   late Shantilal Shah. Prajapati, who used to till Shah’s land, had hatched the crime to finance his gambling activity.
 
 The police had formed 20 teams to locate Jainam. They traced the number from which the ransom call was made using a fake identity proof. They even managed to contact the kidnappers, but he had been killed by then.
 
 Prajapati had also run into a debt of Rs 6 lakh out of which he had taken Rs 1.5 lakh from Shah. Forced by his gambling addiction, he convinced his friend Mala Rabari, who also needed money, to kidnap the boy and demand ransom. It was also decided to keep the boy with Rabari until the ransom was paid.
