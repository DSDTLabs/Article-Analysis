CHENNAI: If you were to shadow   and her cat to every city they went to and keep a tab on the healthcare changes she’s helping enable among India’s most vulnerable communities, chances are you’ll lose pace as quickly as she gains hers.

 “What I’m doing is getting people to talk,” says the palliative care physician who left her job at the MNJ Institute of Oncology in Hyderabad to travel around the country and extend better end-of-life care to those who needed it. In 2013, she alsostartedOrikalankini, an organisation that aims to change narratives around menstruation and female sexuality through art, dialogue and theatre.
 
 It has reached out to women across the country. But most prominently, Rooh is known as the woman who brought to India the  .
 
 The Death Café movement was started by business development director Jon Underwood and Susan Barsky Reid in 2010, as an open invitation to people to discuss death over tea and cake. Rooh held the first Death Café in February 2017 in Hyderabad, and has organised 18 since around the country.
 
 “I realised that even palliative physicians are not ready to talk about death. As I started looking for work by other death researchers, I came across this initiative that I could use to engage not just doctors and patients, but also the public,” she says.
 
 She engages with students of law on the possibility of getting advanced directives — a legal document that allows a person to choose their future course of treatment, should they reach a point where they cannot decide due to illness or incapacity. Currently, this is not available in India. Rooh also works to provide end-oflife needs for the LGBTQIA community.
 
 As part of her Orikalankini initiative, Sneha has reached out to people to share their experience of dealing with stillbirths and abortions. “That’s because these stories are about ungrieved children, and grief is an important part of palliative care,” she says.
