MANALI: Wildlife photographers and experts chasing the snow leopard often return without sighting the shy cat. The lakhs of rupees they spend on dragging their equipment up the higher reaches of the   is no guarantee that the notoriously shy animal will emerge from the shadows and reveal itself. 

 It is for this reason that Shiv  , a young block officer with the   wildlife department, is considered by many to be one of the luckiest men living on the snow-clad mountains. aving discovered a passion for wildlife photography only in 2010, he has succeeded in getting rare footage of the snow leopard for the second time in 12 months in Himachal's   region recently. What makes his finding special is that the cat has never been sighted in Lahaul before.
 
 Shiv first succeeded in recording over 1.5 minutes of video footage of the snow leopard above   road near Udaipur in February last year when the cat was chasing an ibex. The cat was again captured for over 30 seconds of video footage at another place near Udaipur on December 29 and 30. 
 
 "I had installed three camera traps, all in video mode, about a month back," Kumar says. 
 
 "Foreign wildlife experts had visited Lahaul some years back and left behind the cameras, which helped me chase my dream. "I have been chasing snow leopards and western tragopan (a brightly coloured pheasant found in the Himalayas) since 2010."
 
 He adds that poaching of ibex has almost stopped in   which has resulted in an increase in its population. Ibex is the favourite prey of the snow leopard. In winter, ibex come down from the peaks and snow leopards follow them.
