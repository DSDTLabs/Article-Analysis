HYDERABAD: Justice M   of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority’s planning wing director Purushottam   who was arrested by Anti-Corruption Bureau on graft charges.

 Reddy’s counsel told the court there is no point in retaining him in jail as he has already been in detention in jail for nearly 2 months and also in view of the completion of custodial interrogation by police.
 
 However,   counsel   opposed the bail plea, saying he had disappeared after registration of the case against him and also in view of the huge number of assets surfacing during ACB probe. “The investigation is still in progress and his enlargement on bail at this stage may hamper the progress of the probe. He may also tamper with the evidence and threaten the witnesses,” the ACB counsel said. Agreeing with the ACB counsel, the HC judge dismissed Reddy’s bail plea.
 
 ACB counsel also informed HC that they are still awaiting info from various organisations about the misdeeds of Reddy and assets he acquired illegally. “Purushottam caused disappearance of several records while he was underground and if allowed to go out now, he will become a stumbling block to the ACB probe,” Rao said.
