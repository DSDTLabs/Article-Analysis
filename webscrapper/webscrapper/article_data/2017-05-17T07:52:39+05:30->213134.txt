JALANDHAR: After the death of photojournalist   (27) -- who had died on May 14 after sustaining serious head injury on the night of May 13, as his motorcycle had hit a pothole left unrepaired after some work by the   municipal corporation -- police registered a case of death due to negligence against unidentified civic body officials.   was cremated on Tuesday evening.

 On Monday, Punjab chief minister Captain   had asked the principal secretary of local bodies to seek a report about the incident, and directed him to fix responsibility over the MCâ€™s failure to maintain the road in a proper condition, even after spending crores of rupees.
 
 After a precious life was lost and the CM took serious note of the incident, the Jalandhar MC machinery swung into action to fill all potholes in the city which were left unrepaired for a long time. 
 
 Meanwhile, Congress leaders led by district unit president Daljit Singh Ahluwalia said Jalandhar mayor   was responsible for such serious flaws in the working of the MC, which resulted in the loss of a young life.
