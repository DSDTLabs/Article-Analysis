When the   government declared   were a minority religion distinct from Hinduism in March this year,   was betting on splitting the community and wooing the Lingayats away from the Saffron party and BS  , the Lingayat leader who has been in and out of the BJP since 2012. 

 The Lingayats influence 100 of the 224 seats in the Karnataka assembly. They are dominant in   region where they make up over 15 per cent of the population and Shivamongga and Haveri districts—Yeddyurappa’s stronghold. Why is the Hyderabad-Karnataka region important? A look at the turnout in the 2013 elections reveals that this region had the some of the lowest turnout in the state. 
 
 VOTER TURNOUT IN 2013 AND 2008
  
  
 
 How can low turnout impact results? The 2013 results data reveals that the   was a clear winner in Lingayat dominant areas with a 67 per cent seat share. In fact, compared to 2008, the Congress doubled its seat share in these areas in 2013.
 
 Dig a little deeper, and you see that the highest vote share -- 50 per cent in 2013 went to Others, which includes Yeddyurappa’s KJP party which bagged a 20 per cent seat share in Lingayat dominant areas—double of what BJP bagged. Even the Congress saw its vote share fall by 7 per cent . Clearly, BJP’s split with Yeddyurappa meant both the BJP and the KJP nullified each other’s chances of winning, while the Congress walked away with two third of the seats in this region.
 
 WHO LINGAYATS VOTED FOR IN 2013 AND 2008
  
  
 
 Now that Yeddyurappa is back in the BJP as its CM candidate, there is a chance that the Lingayat vote will swing the party's way. For Siddaramaiah, having an upper hand this election will depend on playing up the minority card with Lingayats and getting more of them out to vote to make the Congress's base stronger.
