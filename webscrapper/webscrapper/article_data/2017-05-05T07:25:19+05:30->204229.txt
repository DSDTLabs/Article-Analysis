BHOPAL: The 'Win With  ' campaign was a huge draw among the Bhopalis on Thursday as some of the enthusiastic and aware readers shared their association with the newspaper. 

 The citizens were seen making a conscious effort to support the cause of streamlining the   traffic in the city's busiest areas.
 
 Around 30 winners happily flashed their copy at the   and Arera Petrol Pump crossings and received gifts from The   (TOI) volunteers.
 
 The TOI team helped in regulating traffic at major junctions of Bhopal. Citizens with a copy of the newspaper were presented with gifts.
 
 A winner B H Agarwal, an avid TOI reader for 50 years, said his morning starts with TOI and appreciated the campaign.
 
 Another winner Nilesh Desai said, "A good campaign carried out by TOI to create awareness about traffic rules, which is the need of the hour. TOI should come up with more such awareness programmes, and help in streamlining the traffic."
 
 Nilesh Wardhani said, "The campaign is very encouraging for people." He hailed the efforts being undertaken by the volunteers in the interest of the city of lakes.
 
 The winners at Board Office and Arera Petrol Pump crossings were Ravi Ravikant, Dilip Malhotra, Vivek, L K Agrawal, Rajesh Kothari, Sharad Toke, M K Manoj, B M Dubey among others. The venues will be same today. Hope to see more turn up before we enter the last week of 'Win With The Times'.
