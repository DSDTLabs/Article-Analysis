 • We are a small regional party and find ourselves between two national parties. We can never match BJP or Congress in terms of resources. But one factor is in our favour — good governance by Kumaraswamy when he was CM, despite BJP’s non-cooperation.
 
 
 
 • We want to form government. We’ll win substantial seats across the state, including Mysuru and in Bidar. The alliance with BSP will help. Mayawati’s party is sure to win a few in Mysuru, Mandya and Bidar… If we fail to get majority, we’ll sit in the opposition, after which elections will have to be held again within two months. While Modi government has absolute majority in Lok Sabha, any intent to delay the poll process will not pass muster in Rajya Sabha. Hence, the election will have to be conducted within two months.
 
 
 
 • We were in talks with the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party. But once we came to know they were cosying up to Maharashtra Ekikran Samithi (MES), we were clear a coalition is not possible.
 
 We clearly said we cannot have an alliance with someone who is friends with Congress or MES.
 
 
 
 • (Smiles)… I cannot talk about Pawar. He is a tall leader. Those accusing me of moving closer to BJP should ask why Congress had an alliance with DMK, a member of NDA. Why did Congress (netas) visit (M) Karunandhi?
 
 
 
 • It’s not been easy to get funds after demonetisation... (in a lighter vein) After this interview, I hope our stock goes up and we will get more funds.
 
 
 
 •   can never be a strong leader. The Congress high command is weak after the party lost all states from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, barring  . That’s why Siddaramaiah’s leading the campaign and Rahul Gandhi’s waving from the rear.
 
 
 
 • Let them be. I haven’t seen a worse government. Can you imagine police complaining about their safety and security? What happened to the Lokayukta? I haven’t seen this scale of corruption ever before.
 
 
 
 • Contesting elections is one thing, responding to the call of the nation another. There are two models of coalition in discussion, one with the Congress, one without it. There’ll be more clarity as we get closer to the general election.
