 The Thangals told the Samastha leadership that they have unshakable faith in Samastha's ideology and assured that they will not go astray from the path followed by their forefathers.
 
 A meeting of the Samastha coordination committee had constituted a five-member committee to discuss the issues related to Thangals' participation in the Mujahid meeting. The committee met here on Tuesday and exhorted all to desist from making any statement in the social media on the issue.
 
  president and Samastha vice-president Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal, Samastha president Syed Muhammad Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal, P K Kunhalikutty, Syed Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal, M T Abdulla Musaliyar, Bahaudeen Nadvi Kooriyad and others attended the meeting.
 
 The issue was settled amicably after the Samastha and IUML realized that the developments, if allowed to grow unchecked, would have dangerous repercussions. Samastha was reluctant to take disciplinary action against the members of the Panakkad family which is held in high esteem by the Muslim community in Kerala.
 
 Samastha leadership is also aware that some forces are waiting for a chance to utilize the chasm between the Samastha and Panakkad family.
