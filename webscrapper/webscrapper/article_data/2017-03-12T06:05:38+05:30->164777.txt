NEW DELHI: When   released the list of its star campaigners in the run-up to UP polls, what caught the attention was the missing names. The list didn't have names of veterans like L K Advani and  , besides that of other bigwigs, including Varun Gandhi and Vinay Katiyar.

 The message was not missed -the veterans had little role to play in the new dispensation. PM   remained the party's mascot with BJP President   busy strategising for the contest.The UP verdict showed that that Modi, aided by Shah's poll management skills, almost single-handedly took the party to a historic tally in the state.
 
 The veterans were not to be seen anywhere. In Shah's scheme, it was only about Modi's charisma and the work done by the Centre. “It was as if UP was voting for Modi,“ said member. Some feel the leadership was apprehensive that any slip-up by the old guard could spoil the narrative. 
 
 The Modi-Shah duo didn't have cordial relations with the veterans, some of whom were uncomfortable with Modi's projection as PM candidate. Soon after the LS victory, BJP formed a `Margdarshak Mandal', making Advani, Joshi its members.
