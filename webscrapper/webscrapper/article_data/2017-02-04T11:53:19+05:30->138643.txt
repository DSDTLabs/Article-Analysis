SURAT: Small and medium diamond manufacturing units in Mehsana district will be able to use modern technology thanks to Gujarat’s first Common Facility Centre (CFC) being inaugurated at Visnagar on February 13 which will help them bring their productivity at par with global standards. It will be inaugurated by commerce secretary  . 

 The Union ministry of commerce and industry had sanctioned four CFCs under phase I of special scheme of the 12th Five-Year Plan in Gujarat at Visnagar, Amreli, Palanpur and Ahmedabad. The Gems and   (GJEPC), the nodal agency, had signed   (MoUs) with local diamond associations for setting up of the CFCs.
 
 Gujarat is the hub of diamond manufacturing with diamond centres located in more than a dozen talukas and districts. Small and medium diamond units, doing works for diamantaires in Surat, are located in small towns. They use old technology as cost to upgrade, acquire and install a state-of-the-art technology is beyond them. 
 
 This has resulted in low productivity and also inferior quality of finished goods. Further, there also exists a need to organize skill upgradation training for the artisans involved in diamond manufacturing activities to make them aware about operations and benefit of the state-of-the-art equipment. Establishment of CFCs in small towns and villages would greatly help to transfer technological advancement benefit to the needy diamond manufacturer.
 
 “Outcome of this initiative is to increase productivity and improve the quality of finished goods with better yield,” GJEPC regional chairman   said.
 
 He added, “The CFCs will be equipped with latest technology for the ready use of diamond manufacturers. At present, most of the units in Saurashtra and Mehsana use outdated technology.”
