JALANDHAR: UK-based Federation of Sikh Organisations (FSO) has claimed that over 225   had confirmed by the end of January that since 1984 they had never let Indian government officials speak from their stages or given them any form of recognition and they had no plans to change their stance. On January 7, the   had announced the imposition of restrictions on Indian officials in the UK gurdwaras.

 However, it also claimed that the original plan was to publish a list of UK gurdwaras, where restrictions were in place, had been altered “due to the overwhelming level of support from UK gurdwaras, some of which specifically did not ask to be named, given the outrageous threats reported in the Indian media.”
 
 Detailing the reason for not releasing the list, the FSO constituenct Sikh Federation   Amrik Singh said, “In the UK, we have a duty to take care of members of gurdwara management committees. We have deliberately not published a list of gurdwaras backing the restrictions. This has allowed us to outmanoeuvre and embarrass the Indian authorities, their supporters and agents.”
 
 In a statement issued on Tuesday, the FSO argued that it had been widely reported in the Indian media that the Indian authorities had compiled a “blacklist” of gurdwara representatives in Canada where a list of relevant gurdwaras had been published, besides they could not find members of management committees prepared to back Indian officials visiting gurdwaras. It also alleged that the Indian authorities had developed personal links with certain individuals in specific gurdwaras and knew that the restrictions would never apply to all UK gurdwaras.
