Actor   has joked he just discovered he had a second daughter - 16-month-old Ines-with wife  .

  
  
 
 Reportedly, the proud parents also have a three-year-old daughter   and he has left his   followers laughing with a trademark quip about his family.
 
 Taking to social media, he teased: "Nothing better than the simple joys of finding 5 bucks in an old pair of pants or discovering my wife and I had a second daughter over a year ago."
 
  
  
 Tongue-in-cheek tweets are nothing new for Reynolds or his fans. He is often seen posting deliberately outrageous messages regarding his family and career.
 
 Last summer, he wrote: "My daughter loves being buried up to her neck in sand at the beach. Her little face lights up when I come back to get her the next day."
