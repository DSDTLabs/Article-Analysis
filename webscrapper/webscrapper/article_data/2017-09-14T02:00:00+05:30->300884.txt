A party hosted by a private fashion institute was high on the fun quotient. The youngsters came dressed in their ethnic best which was the dress code of the event. The highlights of the bash were some commendable performances. Shreya Singh and Sandhyajyoti grooved on the song Tenu Suit that won them second and third prize, respectively, while a dance on a Bhojpuri number by Sashikant won him the best dancer award.
Not just their performances, in fact, the style statement made by the students was also appreciated. Diksha Singh and Vishal were given the best dressed award.
