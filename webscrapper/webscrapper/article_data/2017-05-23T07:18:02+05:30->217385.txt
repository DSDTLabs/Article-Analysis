MUMBAI: Acko General Insurance, India’s first online-only   company, has racked up $30 million, or Rs 200 crore, in one of the largest ever seed funding rounds after it received an in-principle regulatory clearance to launch recently.

 Acko is being backed by the likes of N R Narayan Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures,   (cofounder of Infosys), Hemendra Kothari (of DSP Blackrock) and Atul Nishar (of Hexaware Technologies), along with venture funds Accel Partners and  . The Mumbai-based startup has spun off as an independent entity after a restructuring at online insurance aggregator Coverfox, which saw its co-founder and CEO   step out to kick-start the insurtech platform. Globally, a slew of well-funded insurtech ventures — like Alibaba and Tencent-backed Chinese startup   valued at $8 billion, which is slated for an IPO, and Trov and Lemonade in the US — are disrupting traditional insurers by focusing on younger consumers who largely transact digitally with customised and targeted products. 
 
 While the old guard of the insurance industry offers policies online, Acko is the first online-only insurance firm to begin operations here. Only 3% of insurance is bought online currently in India in an overall $80-billion market, but is likely to grow rapidly keeping in mind the young demographic accessing services online. According to rules set up by the insurance regulator, no insurer carrying on the business of life insurance, general insurance or re-insurance can be registered unless the entity has a paid-up equity capital of Rs 100 crore. Dua told TOI in a chat that while he will run Acko, Devendra Rane, his co-founder at Mumbai-based Coverfox, will continue to oversee the insurance aggregator which they both started in 2013. VC funds Accel, SAIF and Narayan Murthy’s Catamaran are also investors in Coverfox. However, Acko may look to bring on board global insurance groups as its backers going forward
