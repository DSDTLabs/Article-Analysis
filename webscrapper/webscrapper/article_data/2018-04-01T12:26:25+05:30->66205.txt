VADODARA: The   ( ) standing committee has again put on hold a proposal to form a public trust for heritage in the city. The decision was taken as the civic body has already started work on heritage in the city and has a cell for the same.

 The proposal for the trust was first moved in September 2015, it was taken up for discussion in October in the same year but no decision was taken regarding it and the item was held. The standing committee discussed it again on Saturday, but did not take a decision and postponed it.
 
 Sources said that since the proposal was moved in before the present standing committee chairperson Dr Jigisha Sheth and municipal commissioner   took over, there was little clarity on why the trust was proposed. According to insiders, some also felt that the independent trust that was proposed to be headed by a retired civil servant would have become a body outside the control of the VMC.
 
 “Good work has started on the heritage in the city already. We can consider having a good cell within the VMC involving our own officials to look into heritage. We will discuss the proposal further and then come to a conclusion,” said Sheth.
 
 Apart from setting up the trust, the proposal had also sought authorisation for expenses towards the heritage cell and appointments of personnel to it by outsourcing and other related decisions. It had also sought preparation of publicity material using various mediums.
