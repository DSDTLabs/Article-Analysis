LUCKNOW: A handshake, a hug, some smiles shared and many pats on the back set the stage for the first public display of the   bonhomie on Sunday. Shutterbugs went clicking when the two arrived for the joint launch of the campaign—UP Ko Ye Saath Pasand Hai but the friendly warmth lingered well after the cameras were not clicking. 

 Playing up their popularity among youth and stating that their politics was focussed on development instead of divining people, Rahul and Akhilesh sought to brush aside charges that alliance talks had been delayed because of internal problems. Emphasising his personal friendship with Akhilesh, Rahul said, “Political negotiations are conversations...there is posturing and there are negotiations. First Akhilesh pretended to be angry and then I pretended to be a little angry, but we were at the same time exchanging text messages communicating with each other. In the end, we agreed by and large that this is the direction we both want to take and we are moving forward. All that posturing is a part of any negotiation but the problem is that the media takes everything too seriously.”
 
 Later, after responding to a question about the alliance, a beaming Rahul, pleased with his answer, turned to Akhilesh and held his arm: “Kaisa laga mera jawab?” Akhilesh laughed and said, “Bahut achha.” Akhilesh also stepped in to rescue Rahul from a tricky question on whether the two party patriarchs will campaign. Rahul remained non-committal and said all those who believe in the shared ideology were welcome, while Akhilesh sought to balance the answer and said he was grateful to have the blessings of all his party elders.
