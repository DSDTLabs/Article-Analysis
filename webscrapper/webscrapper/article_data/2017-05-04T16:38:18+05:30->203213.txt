KOLHAPUR: The four major dams in the district—Radhanagari, Tulashi, Warna and Dudhganaga—have recorded 12% more live   than the corresponding year. 

 The district generally gets abundant rainfall to fill the dams. But, the situation was particularly bad last summer due to poor monsoon in 2015. 
 
 The district administration had to ban water lifting on rivers, which affected the sugarcane output in the district. The situation turned around this year owing to good monsoon. 
 
 Talking about the water storage in main dams in the district, deputy chief engineer of water resources department K C  , said, “There are four major dams in the district which play an important role in irrigation and supply of drinking water. Radhanagari, Tulshi, Warana and Dudhganga have 12% higher water storage than the previous year. Dudhganga dam has highest live water storage of 6.67 TMC than previous years 1.98 TMC.
 
 He further added, “Usually, water planning takes place in the month of October after the end of monsoon. The committee consists of ministers, administrative officers, officials in sugar mills and local representatives. Every government department participates in planning and implementation of water management. This year, we have planned management till June 30. Smart and better management of water is necessary. We regularly organise water saving campaigns at ground level.”
 
 Another official on the condition of anonymity, said, “The Radhanagari and Dhudhganaga are much more important for drinking water for Kolhapur, Rukadi, Surve, Ichalkaranji, Terwad, Shirol and many other villages in the district. Warana dam is a big source of drinking water for the many villages in   and   district.”
