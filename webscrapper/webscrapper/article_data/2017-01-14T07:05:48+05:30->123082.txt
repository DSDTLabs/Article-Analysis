HYDERABAD: To curb unauthorized layouts and ensure a planned growth of the  , the   ( ) has proposed implementing a land pooling scheme.

 “Draft rules for the land pooling scheme have been sent to the municipal administration department for approval," metropolitan commissioner T Chiranjeevulu told TOI on Wednesday . “Land owners stand to gain as there will be no expenditure towards layout development fee or other facilities," he further added.
 
 Under the proposed scheme, individual land owners will voluntarily give at least 50 acres (20 hectares) to the authority , which will develop the area by setting up amenities such as roads, drains, and other infrastructure. In return, the land owners will get developed plots --each individual is expected to get up to 97,200 sq m for each acre of land contributed to the scheme--while the HMDA will earn revenue from its land share that will be utilised for all its projects.
 
 “There is a provision in the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority Act for a land pooling scheme. The draft rules have been prepared according to sections 28 and 29 of the Act," said Rajesham, member estates, HMDA. As per the draft rules, HMDA will select locations for LPS and a state-appointed committee will look into the viability of each proposal.Officials said Kandi village in Sangareddy district near IIT Hyderabad is among the locations selected for the scheme.
 
 Land pooling schemes have been successful in other states, including Gujarat and Haryana. Andhra Pradesh has recently implemented LPS in Amravati where farmers, who had lost land to the new capital, will get developed land in return. The HMDA had earlier implemented LPS in Uppal Bhagat near Nagole on a pilot basis. Initially, the authority had planned to acquire land at Uppal Bhagat for Metro rail depot and other infrastructure, but following resistance from farmers, it decided to develop the layout and give them developed plots.
