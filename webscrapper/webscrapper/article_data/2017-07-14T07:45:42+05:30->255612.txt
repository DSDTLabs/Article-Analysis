"In any case, the party president and chief minister took cognizance of the issue and asked the   to tender and unconditional apology," Rajeshwar Reddy told TOI. 
 
 Though the incident involving   has become an embarrassment for the party, leaders did not expect it to take a such serious turn with the collector insisting on lodging a police complaint. "Like it happens it every party, Nayak may also be asked to give a written explanation about the incident. He obeyed the party president's diktat and apologized to the collector. The party did not wish to consider whatever line of defence he would have wanted to take as it involved a woman and a collector," Rajeshwar Reddy said.
