NASHIK: The average wholesale   prices at Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( ) have crashed by 65% in just three months due to rise in supply. The prices have decreased from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 21.

 In the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg following the fall in wholesale prices.
 
 The minimum and maximum prices at   on Monday were Rs 400 and Rs 861 per quintal, respectively, when around 8,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.
 
 “The harvest of summer onions is in full swing and that has led to rise in supply. Also, the demand for onions have reduced because of the ongoing holy month of Ramzan. All this has led to decline in prices,” APMC officials said.
 
 Usually, farmers prefer storing summer onions, as it has a shelf life of five to six months, with a hope of getting better price later. “But there is a vast section of farmers who need money and are bringing their produce to the APMCs,” the official added.
 
 Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, “Onions with inferior quality or which can’t be stored are being brought to the APMCs. The poor quality onions are fetching low rates. This is the major reason behind the fall in prices.”
 
 Holkar said the wholesale prices would either prevail at the present rate or will slide further till June 15, after which the prices would increase.
 
 Last month, the central government roped in the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd to procure onions in a bid to stabilise prices. But the prices continued to drop.
