CHANDIGARH: Now, no separate lane or traffic cop will be required at city traffic lights to enable hassle free movement of emergency vehicles as an automated emergency vehicle preemption system (AEVPS) has been developed by National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research ( ), Chandigarh.

 The AEVPS automatically reads the movement of an emergency vehicle when it comes in the radar of one kilometre near the traffic light point and the traffic signals timing will be automatically controlled through zigbee transmitter and the road will be cleared for the vehicle at the earliest.
 
 Prof C   from department of computer science and engineering, NITTTR, who along with other departments involved in developing this system, said that they had they kept in mind that no chaos at traffic light point should be created when an emergency vehicle moves. He added that the system has been developed in such a way that even though the timing of all traffic light points except from the one where the vehicle is moving will decrease, it will not suddenly shut the movement of the traffic.
 
 Professor   letha, electrical engineering department, NITTTR said the system was successfully tried at   and a project report was prepared for this system. She said the report is submitted to the department of science and technology (DST) for execution in the city. The institute received Rs 2 lakh from   for developing this system.
 
 The institute is planning to have a second phase also in which they are trying to work on the vehicle density at traffic light points so that the lights get automatically changed accordingly. Prof C Rama Krishna said they will send this proposal to the central DST for funding of the second phase of the system.
 
 Those working on the system include   from electrical engineering department,   and   from department of urban planning, Chandigarh administration.
