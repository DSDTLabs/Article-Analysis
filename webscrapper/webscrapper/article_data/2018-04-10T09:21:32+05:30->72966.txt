GORAKHPUR: Setting a unique example of compassion and devotion for wildlife, forest department employees in UP’s   district on Sunday shook off all fears and risk to their lives and carried an ailing leopard on a two-wheeler to save its life as arranging a cage would have taken time.

 Around 11 am, they found a leopard lying unconscious near Potha Nulla at Tangia 28 nursery in   range and informed ranger  . The ranger rushed to the spot with his assistants D P Kushwaha, Virendra and   and informed DFO   about the ailing leopard.
 
 They requested for a cage to carry the leopard to a nearby veterinary hospital. Apprehensive that the wait for a cage may prove fatal for the big cat, two staffers decided to carry it on a motorcycle to save its life without fearing for their own.
 
 “On Sunday, an ailing leopard was found in Dakshini Chowk range during patrolling; forest employees carried it on a motorcycle to forest department office from where it was taken to hospital in a cage. The leopard was treated and given food. It responded very well and recovered quickly. It has been kept under observation for two days. We are trying to find why leopards are getting sick in Dakshini Chowk range,” said DFO Singh.
 
 On March 22, a leopard was found dead in the area.
