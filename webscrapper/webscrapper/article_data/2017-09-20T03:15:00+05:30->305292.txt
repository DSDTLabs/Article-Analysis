Patna: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday attached properties worth Rs 1.53 crore of two businessmen for their alleged involvement in money laundering activities, including huge cash deposits in demonetised currencies.

 According to sources, ED investigations have concluded that businessmen Rajesh Agrawal and R K Gupta deposited a large amount of demonetised currency in bank accounts of innocent persons without their consent in Gaya. While Agrawal runs Muzaffarpur-based Maa Tara Agency, Gupta is the proprietor of Delhi-based M/s Harikripa. 
 
 The attached assets include two flats and a house in Muzaffarpur.
 
 “Our probe under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act found that officials of the Bank of India in Gaya connived with the businessmen and allowed them to deposit their demonetised currency in accounts not held by them,” an ED official told TOI, adding these bank accounts have already been frozen by the central enforcement agency.
 
 Giving details, the ED official said a sum of Rs 1.46 crore in demonetised currency was deposited in two bank accounts before being transferred to Maa Tara Agency’s account. Another Rs 82.51 lakh in demonetised currency was deposited in the bank account of another person and subsequently transferred to the account of M/s Harikripa.
 
 The official said Agrawal and Gupta could not offer any convincing explanation for the suspicious deposits and transactions. “The role of bank officials and other properties of the two businessmen are also under investigation,” the ED official said.
 
 Earlier on Monday, the ED got the Adjudicating Authority’s nod for possession of the attached movable and immovable assets of former Bihar drug controller Y K Jaiswal and his family, valued at Rs 1.13 crore.
