Notably, a total of 1,208 drunk drivers faced action for violating rules.
 
 Traffic cops from Chamber IV said they cracked a whip on a total of 307 drunk drivers during the Holi period, besides confiscating vehicles of some for not producing proper documents. Police said they released 265 vehicles after verifying valid documents.
 
 “Even as we were taking action against the drunk drivers, we also called such persons to attend the counselling session,” said one of the traffic cops while speaking to TOI.
 
 It is learnt that counsellor   urged the boozers to quit drinking alcohol for the betterment of their families. Dr   also told them about the health hazards of consuming alcohol.
 
 Smartna Patil said, “A few erring drivers attending the session asked why the event was organized on a working day. However, we addressed their apprehension by explaining the motive behind organizing such a programme. We also urged them to understand the importance of time.”
 
 “We came to know that majority of the people are addicted to alcohol just for having fun. It is impossible to stop people from consuming liquor, but they should be aware about the ill effects it causes to one’s health,” Patil added.
