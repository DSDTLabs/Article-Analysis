LUCKNOW: Work at   remained paralysed for the whole day following protests by students who locked up the main gate, barring entry to the campus. Many students scaled the gates and walls to attend classes or for miscellaneous work at the administrative building. Some also fell down in the process, injuring themselves, while the others waited for the protest to get over so that they could enter the campus.

 Those who had come to get their migration, transfer certificate or other documents had to return empty-handed. BA second and third-year students could not submit their fees as the cashier’s   was forced shut by the students.
 
 “The main gate was locked so I came from the next gate to submit BA second year fees and I had to walk nearly a km,” said Shashank Saxena. “I stood in a long queue and by the time my turn came, the cashier’s office was forcibly closed by the protesting students,” said BA student Anamika Saxena. More than 200 students had to return after the cashier’s office was closed for the day.
 
 “I came in the morning to collect the degree form for my new job but the protesting students did not allow me in. When I came again in the afternoon, all the ways to CPMT building had been blocked,” said Asif Anwar.
 
 The administrative block could not continue its functioning because students had locked the entry and the exit gates.
