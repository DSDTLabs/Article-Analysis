Erode: State school education minister K A Sengottaiyan took a dig at actor Rajinikanth stating that the government cannot respond to allegations levelled by ‘small’ political parties. He told reporters at Perundurai in Erode district on Sunday that Rajinikanth’s allegation that ‘system’ was flawed in Tamil Nadu does not warrant a reaction at all.

 “There are lots of small political parties launched every day. There is no need to respond to their statements and allegations,” he said when asked about Rajinikanth’s statement.
 
 “All I can say is that no one can shake the foundations of AIADMK government and the party,” he said. Sengottaiyan said they would go ahead with unveiling of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s portrait in the state assembly. He said grand celebrations will be organized across the state to commemorate Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary.
 
 State electricity minister P Thangamani, meanwhile, hit out at sidelined AIADMK leader T T V Dhinakaran that the latter’s dream of ‘toppling the government’ will not fructify. Thangamani alleged that Dhinakaran wanted to control AIADMK and topple the government. “But his dreams will be shattered. He is desperate to grab power, but has no intention of serving people,’’ Thangamani alleged.
