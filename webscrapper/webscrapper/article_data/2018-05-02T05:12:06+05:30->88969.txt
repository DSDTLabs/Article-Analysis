BENGALURU: The   high court has observed that a “housewife is as busy as a professional”, while rejecting the petition of a Bengaluru man, who refused to pay his estranged wife’s flight expenses, saying she has enough “free time to travel by train.” 

 
  had approached the HC challenging a February 1, 2018 order of a family court, which directed him to pay Rs 32,114 as travelling expenses to his wife   Jain, who lives in Muzaffarnagar, towards travel expenses for attending their divorce hearing in Bengaluru. 
 
 Gaurav’s counsel had argued that Shweta was a homemaker and had free time to travel by train instead of taking a flight and said it didn’t fit into “requisite expenditure” as mentioned by the apex court. 
 
 “A large number of people continue to carry a misnomer that a housewife is ‘free’. Needless to say, a housewife is as busy as a professional person. After all, she is responsible for looking after members of family and for running the house,” Justice   observed in his order passed on April 26. The HC said a husband cannot decide the mode of transportation his wife takes to attend hearings.
