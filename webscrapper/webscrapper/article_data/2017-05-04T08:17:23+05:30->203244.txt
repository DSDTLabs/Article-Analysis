BENGALURU: Confronted with an increasing number of foreigners allegedly getting sucked into the world of crime, Benglauru police are mulling deporting those arrested on criminal charges. The idea comes in the wake of a recent notification by the Foreigner Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) asking 12   to leave the country within 15 days. 

 “So far, we have been charging them and sending them to jail. Once a case starts they can’t leave the country or be deported till the trial is over. Many of them manage to get bail and then vanish,” said  , city police commissioner. 
 
 Police are now looking at not charging foreigners caught in serious cases, and deporting them. A senior police officer who supervised a recent drug bust said police are exploring dropping charges against the two arrested men, and deporting them.
 
 However, the only apprehension for the cops is that the process is not exactly foolproof. FRRO has not issued a deportation order but a notification to leave the country. “The question is, what if they don’t leave? Then we have to book them and once again send them to court,” said a senior officer, on condition of anonymity.
 
 The government, at present, has no plans of providing for the airfare of the deported men, if they claim they have no money to leave. This then becomes another roadblock for cops. Even if these 12 men are flown out with their tickets paid for by the government, there are more than 600 overstaying foreigners in Bengaluru.
 
 Though police started tracking down those staying illegally, many promises by the government to support deportation remains on paper. Home minister   said he had announced the setting up of special task forces in all cities and districts to track down foreigners illegally staying on, but it is yet to be implemented. The promise of having a Foreigners’ Detention Centre at Central Jail, Parapanna Agrahara, to keep them in custody till they are deported, is still a distant reality.
