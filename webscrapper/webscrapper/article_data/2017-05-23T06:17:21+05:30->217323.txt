HYDERABAD: Within 24 hours of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) MLC Mynampally   and his followers allegedly assaulting a   leader Ramesh and his relative right inside   police station, he was given station bail on Monday. Interestingly, the MLC's followers were produced in the local court, while Hanumanth Rao was given station bail. 

 Petbasheerabad police registered a case under section 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common) 290 (punishment for public nuisance), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC against MLC and others. 
 
 Speaking to TOI against the granting of bail, N  , who accompanied Ramesh to the police station, said, "In such a brazen attack - that too right inside the police station - the police registered bailable sections and allowed the accused to walk free. How can this happen?'' 
 
 The police justified their position saying that eight other accused were produced in court and the court too granted them bail. 
 
 When contacted, deputy commissioner of police ( ) Y Sai Sekhar said that since sections registered were bailable, and punishment was less than seven years in all sections, bail was granted just like in any other case. This did not stop the police from facing severe criticism for the different treatment given to the MLC. Cops were also accused of failing to convince the court about sending the accused to judicial remand. 
 
 In the past, there a rowdysheet had been opened against the MLC which was later closed by the police.
 
 This is the not the first time that the Cyberabad police has faced criticism for going soft in cases in which influential persons have been caught. Recently, a TRS MLC's son Snehith Reddy was booked by Petbasheerabad police for allegedly attempting to sexually assault a girl but till date he has not been arrested.
