Madurai: "Our children finally have a place to play," said 74-year-old retired professor, G Sam George, president of Chemparuthi Nagar Welfare Association at Vilangudi, in ward 23 of Madurai City Corporation.

 It was a happy day for residents of Vilangudi as the corporation inaugurated a park in the area at the cost of Rs 42.17 lakh under AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) on Saturday. State cooperative minister, Sellur K Raju inaugurated the new park in the presence of Madurai district collector, K Veera Raghava Rao and corporation commissioner, Aneesh Sekhar.
 
 Vilangudi, an extended area under corporation limits, is yet to get drinking water and underground drainage facilities. "We are paying tax to corporation, but we don't have water and we need road facilities as well. We at least have a good park now," George said.
 
 For other residents, the park meant safety since there will be people around in the mornings. "Several chain snatching incidents are reported in this area especially during mornings. With this park in the area, we are happy that we can go for walks I n the morning and it will be safe," said L Sumathi, a resident. While inaugurating the park, Sellur K Raju urged the public to maintain it. It will be a great place for children to play, he said and added that developmental works like roads, paver blocks and bore wells at the cost of Rs 3.16 crore at ward 23 is underway, he said.
