While Day 1 of the ongoing   celebrations at Orlando, Florida was nostalgia-heavy, with the original cast and crew - including   (in his first ever celebrations appearance) and   - dominating panel sessions - Day 2 treated fans to a tete-a-tete with the whole new generation of the intergalactic lot.
Stars at the special session dedicated to the upcoming and much awaited flick - Star Wars: The Last Jedi included Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and director Rian Johnson - each of whom teased the fans with delicious reveals surrounding the film's plot.
 So what can one expect from the newest addition to the beloved series? - here's what we learnt from the exclusive session with the crew.
 
 1. Daisy revealed that The Last Jedi "will go deep into Ray's story". She said, "where we left off is that Rey has a certain expectation as to what she might be getting from Luke. And as a lot of people know, it’s difficult when you meet your heroes because it might not be what you expect."
 2. John Boyega aka Finn assured us he will be back, post his back injury in the last film. Besides his role, he is also reprising his relationship with Poe (the character essayed by  ) in the film. 
 "Poe's my boy," he said, adding, "So, there's always new adventures to go on."
 3. Also back is BB8, because as Rian put it "You cannot have enough of BB8."
 4. Joining the resistance is a whole new character named Rose, played by Kellie Marie Tran. According to her backstory, is a maintenance worker. As Rian puts it, "She’s not a soldier, she’s not looking to be a hero and gets pulled into a big adventure with Finn."
 5. Does Luke finally say his first words though? We are still not sure. Though we were assured he is "significantly important to the next film."
