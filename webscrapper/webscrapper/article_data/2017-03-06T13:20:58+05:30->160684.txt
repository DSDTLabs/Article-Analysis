Heading to the beach to get a beautiful tan? Think again. A new study has found that radiation from the Sun or tanning sessions hasten skin ageing in the long run.

 Environmental factors can damage the skin in multiple ways, from short wave ultraviolet B (UVB) rays causing sunburns and uneven pigmentation to long wave ultraviolet A (UVA) and infrared radiation penetrating more deeply into the skin to damage existing collagen and reduce collagen production, resulting in wrinkles and sagging skin.
 
 “Ultraviolet radiation from the sun and indoor tanning beds not only can increase your risk of skin cancer but also can contribute to skin ageing," said Arianne Shadi Kourosh, of Massachusetts General Hospital in the US.
 
 “Moreover, other forms of radiation, such as heat and visible light, can negatively impact the skin, as can pollution, so protecting your skin from the environment can benefit both your health and appearance," said Kourosh on Saturday. Researchers from Massachusetts said that habitual ultraviolet exposure could cause blood vessels to become more prominent, causing skin redness, while visible light and pollution could cause uneven skin tone, especially in darker skin types.
 
 “Since both types of ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the skin, it is important to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen that provides both long wave ultraviolet A and short wave ultraviolet B protection, with an SPF of 30 or higher" Kourosh said.
