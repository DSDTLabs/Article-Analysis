 is an artist with a mission. When he sees a   or open manhole, this   doesn’t just drive past it like most city folk, but looks at what he can do to ensure that it isn’t left unattended. And this is what he did with his recent work near   on  . An open   on the footpath posed a threat to pedestrians, so, in his usual style, Baadal got to work and painted the slabs to resemble a voting machine. This garnered the right attention and the gaping hole was fixed in no time.
