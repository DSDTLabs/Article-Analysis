HUBBALLI: Denied ticket by the party from   constituency, BJP leader and former MLA Veerabhadrappa Halaharvi said that he will take a call on his next move by April 24 after holding a meeting with his supporters. 

 He told reporters here on Sunday that the Madiga community has been denied opportunities politically. "Though I was the frontrunner in a survey conducted by the BJP high command, I'm denied ticket. This is unfortunate," he said.
 
 Halaharvi alleged that he was denied ticket due to conspiracies by some leaders in the BJP. "I am an honest worker of the party. The decision of BJP to deny the ticket has upset the Madiga community people. There is a demand from the community that I contest as rebel candidate. I will take a call by April 24 if the party fails to give me B Form," he said.
