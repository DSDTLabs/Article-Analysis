GUWAHATI: An NSCN (K) militant, identified as 'corporal'  , was gunned down by   at the Muktova area in   of Arunachal Pradesh on Monday, said an Army press release issued on Wednesday. Two others are believed to have fled. 

 Sources said the militant was intercepted by the Assam Rifles patrolling party, and, on being challenged, opened fire. "The militants were moving in the area with some sinister motive, which is indicated by the recovery of a powerful IED from the slain militant. A pistol and ammunition including survival stores were also seized," said Lt Col Suneet Newton, PRO (defence), Guwahati.
 
 He added that forces have been keeping a strict vigil and maintaining a robust area domination and counter militancy operation in the disturbed areas of   and East Arunachal Pradesh.
