’s upcoming film ‘Begum Jaan’ has a good amount of hype around it thanks to the bold theme. The first look of the movie was also well received and before the trailer launch on March 14, the makers have a little sneak peek for us.

  
  
  Vishesh Films, which is bankrolling the film, released a short clip that shows   in a bold, bad and beautiful avatar. In the short video, the actress can be seen smoking a hookah with style and looking like a woman who should not be messed with. Overall, it looks like ‘Begum Jaan’ will be able to capture the essence of the Bengali original ‘Rajkahini’, from which it has been adapted.
 
  With movies like ‘Dirty Picture’, ‘Kahaani’ and many others under her belt, it looks like ‘Begum Jaan’ will be another feather Vidya’s illustrious cap.
