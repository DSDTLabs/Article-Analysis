Panaji: Goa fares well in the health sector in terms of indicators like maternal and infant mortality, joint director of planning, statistics and evaluation, Vijay Saxena said recently. 

 He was speaking at an event organised to observe World   at the Goa Science Centre and Planetarium, Panaji, recently.
 
 “The maternal and infant mortality rate in Goa is extremely low compared to other parts of the country. The birth rate is also in control,” he said.
 
 Sharing statistics to back his statement, Saxena said the infant mortality rate in Goa is 13-14 cases per year while the maternal death rate is 8-9 per year.
 
 “Mortality numbers are low in Goa owing to improvement in health infrastructure. As much as 85% of conceiving mothers receive post-natal care while 96% receive neonatal tetanus shots. Also, 77% children receive vaccinations from public health institutions across the state,” he said.
 
 He added that 59% of Goa’s population is aged below 35 years, which gives the state a competitive advantage in its demographic dividend.
 
 According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), demographic dividend is the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population (people between 15 and 64 years of age) is larger than the non-working age share of the population (14 years and younger, and 65 years and older).
 
 “More people in Goa, therefore, have the potential to be productive and contribute to the state’s economy. Since 59% of the populace can contribute to the demographic dividend for another 40-50 years, we need to ensure they are productive during this period,” Saxena said.
 
 He went on to suggest that skill development initiatives must be taken up by the government to hone the young population and meet the requirements of the modern job market.
