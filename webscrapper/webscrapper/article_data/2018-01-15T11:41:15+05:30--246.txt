NAGPUR: International life coach Swami   Das from ISKCON said positive attitude towards simple things in life can bring about success to every man and woman. A large number of youths and people from every age group listened to Das as he delivered a motivational lecture ‘Yuvakana Margadarshan’ as a part of Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav organized on Saturday.

 “Every person in this world wants to know the secrete behind success in professional as well as personal life. Having positive attitude is the key to achieving success in life,” said Das.
 
 “Everybody has a different definition for success, depending upon the various stages of life. Not stopping at achieving short-term goals, we must embrace teachings of our culture, dharma and traditions,” added Das.
 
 Das asked the youth to focus on attitude rather than outer personality. “Our culture teaches us to respect every small thing in our surroundings,” he said.
 
 Speaking about the aspects of success, Das said, “One must learn to digest failures and remain determined to achieve success. If you never give up, you go up in life.”
 
 “Also, we must never hesitate to take help from capable persons in desperate times. We must also support those who are in need. Our life must be like a burning candle, which burns itself but bring light to everyone’s life,” he said.
 
 Union minister  , guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, MLA   Deshmukh, municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal and others were present at the programme.
