Vadodara: District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has served notice to Raman Kapoor, who is currently in the custody of Fatehgunj police, for cheating several citizens of lakhs of rupees in Sunstar Club membership scam.

 Nine among 20 people, who had lodged complaints with the police, approached the consumer forum through Jagrut Nagrik, a city-based voluntary consumer association, for having been conned by Kapoor and his wife Seema, who is currently in jail in the same case. P V Moorjani, managing trustee of the association, said the consumer forum had earlier served the notice to Kapoor at his residence.
 
 But, since Kapoor was on the run, the notice had returned. However, on July 21 when the city police got the custody of Kapoor from Ahmedabad police, the forum served him notice while he was in custody of Fatehgunj police. The consumer forum has asked Kapoor to remain present in person or by a pleader before the forum on August 14.
 
 On June 30, the forum had also served notice to Seema, cricketer Kapil Dev, and film stars Govinda and Ravi Kishan, who are directors of the club, to remain present before the forum on the same day as Kapoor.
 
 The couple had promised club membership and foreign trips to citizens who had paid them money to become members.
