NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal and chief minister   inaugurated 10 skill development centres in the city on Tuesday. These centres have been started by Delhi government to equip homeless people with skills to help them get better job opportunities.

 Speaking at the function organised at a night shelter in Tilak Nagar, Baijal complimented the AAP government for the initiative. 
 
 “It is good to see that homeless people are also being made employable so that they can earn their livelihood,” he said. 
 
 At the centres, the homeless will be trained by qualified teachers in skills like sewing, beauty parlour, electrical work etc. 
 
 Kejriwal said that for the first time a government has thought about helping homeless pick up a skill which can help them earn their livelihood. “No government has worked for them, as they are not a votebank. This work in night shelters by our government shows that we work for the people,” he said. 
 
 The CM also inaugurated 945 community toilets in slum clusters.   said that he understands the problems of people in slums, as he had lived in a slum for a few months. “Toilets are the biggest problem and women are the worst affected. Access to clean toilets is a basic human right,” said Kejriwal. He also said that his government has constructed 60,000 new toilets in the city.
