AMARAVATI: Worried about the drinking water crisis in Chennai,   chief minister Panneerselvam is rushing to Amaravati to meet his counterpart in   on Thursday.

 Pannerselvam has decided to explain to Naidu how severe the water problem in his capital city is.
 
 This is the first visit of any TN chief minister to Amravati to seek the release of   water. Pannerselvam sent an SOS to Naidu seeking immediate release of three to four tmcft of water from Telugu Ganga last week.
 
 Andhra Pradesh is yet to make a decision on the issue as the water levels in the state's projects too are fast dipping, making it difficult for the government to meet the potable and irrigation water needs of Rayalaseema and Nellore districts.
 
 State water resources authorities have started releasing about 12,000 cusecs of water from Kandaleru project in Nellore. It was allocated to meet the drinking water needs of Venkatagiri, Sullurpet and Gudur constituencies.
