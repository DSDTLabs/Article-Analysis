A 27-year-old student from the city died on Saturday morning falling into a gorge while climbing a 15-foot patch at Kalvantin Point — a portion of the Prabalgad fort in Panvel.

 The victim, Chetan Dhande, was accompanied by a friend, when the incident occurred around 9.30am. The Panvel Taluka police said the victim’s hand slipped while climbing the fort and fell into a 400-foot-deep gorge.
 
 Panvel Taluka police head constable Amrut Shinde said, “The victim, Chetan, had gone for a trek on the Prabalgad fort with his friend, Malavika Kulkarni (25). The victim fell into the gorge. A police team rushed to the spot after receiving a call from an NGO (non-government organisation).”
 
 Nisarg Mitra rescue team member Sachin Shinde said, “The deceased had trekked to the last 15 feet climbing portion atop Kalavantin point watch tower in Prabalgad fort. His hand sipped from a rock surface and he first landed 100 feet below, where his bag was found during our search operation. Later, he went down another 300 feet.”
 
 Sachin said, “The victim suffered multiple fractures and head injuries. These led to his death. We found his body around 11am and retrieved it with the help of residents of the area.”
 
 Malavika, the victim’s friend, stated in the police complaint that they were students and were known to each other from childhood. They had arrived at the fort at 8am in a car.
 
 Prabalgad fort is about 117km away from the city. It is one of the most beautiful forts in the state. Many trekkers visit it as it is also known to be a challenging spot to trek.
