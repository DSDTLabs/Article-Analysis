Romi doesn't let Roshni meet Adi in the sangeet function. Roshni is tensed that Gagan, who has entered the function without an invitation, will create a scene. Gagan looks for Adi everywhere.
 
  Adi, on the other hand, has no clue about Gagan and the danger coming his way, and tells Aaliya how excited he is for their special dance performance. Aaliya is nervous.
  
  Just then someone comes and tells Aaliya that she is needed in the dressing room. Adi asks her to go and come back soon as their performance is next.
  
  
 
  
  Aaliya finds Roshni in the dressing room. Roshni then intentionally spills juice over Aaliya's dress. Aaliya panicks as her name is called on the stage and she needs to change now.
  
  She then asks Rohsni to start the dance with Adi so that people don't have to wait and she will join them soon and that was Roshni's plan as well.
  
  She wanted to dance with Adi so that Gagan sees them together and gets satisfied and leaves. Roshni then manages to convince Adi as well.
  
  The dance performance starts and everyone gets shocked to see Roshni with Adi and not Aaliya. Gagan gets happy. Just then Aaliya joins them and by that time Gagan also leaves.
  
  Ishita is shocked and confronts Roshni. Aaliya and Adi come there and tell her that Aaliya had asked Roshni to do so. Raman scolds Adi for taking things so lightly and spoiling the bride and groom's special performance.
