SHIMLA: As plying of CNG buses for 13,050ft-high Rohtang pass is not possible at the moment due to high cost involved in setting up mother and daughter booster stations at Tahliwal in Una and Manali respectively,   has placed orders for 25 electric buses with Chinese company , Gold Stone, to ensure plying of eco-friendly buses between Manali and Rohtang pass by the coming tourist season.

 According to sources, these electric buses would cost around Rs 50 crore and 75% of the cost would be borne by the Government of India. Orders to Chinese firm have been placed on the basis of open tenders. Sources said first the Chinese would be required to send the prototype of bus in a month and final delivery would have to be made in three months.
 
 HP transport minister G S Bali said that by coming tourist season,   would be ready with the electric buses to run on 50km-stretch between Manali and Rohtang pass. He said that the state would be first in the world to ply electric buses at such high altitude.
 
 Bali said that trials of electric buses between Manali and Rohtang pass were successfully conducted last year after which two companies ­ from China and India ­ had submitted their bids to supply electric buses.
 
  (NGT) had directed state to introduce buses on the stretch after a report pointed out that heavy tourism activity in Rohtang pass had its toll on the fragile glaciers besides turning the snow cover black. NGT in April last year had directed the Union ministry of heavy industries to finalize the specifications of the tender for electric buses. It was also decided that expenditure shall be borne in 25:75 ratio by state and Centre.
