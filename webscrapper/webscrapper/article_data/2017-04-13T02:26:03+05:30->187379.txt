GHAZIABAD: An 11-year-old girl allegedly committed suicide by   herself from a   in her house in Pandav Nagar in Kavinagar on Tuesday. The girl, Gunjan, was the daughter of a security guard. She lived with her father and brother and was alone at home.

 Chotte Lal, Gunjan’s father, said, “My son and I had gone out for work and when I returned for lunch I discovered her body hanging from the ceiling fan. I had no idea why she took such an extreme step. She was behaving normally when I had left for work.”
 
 The police are ruling out any foul play. “We reached the spot at 3pm and seized her body. Prima facie it appears that there was no foul play in the incident as the door was locked from inside,” said Kuldeep Singh, sub Inspector, adding,“However, we are still investigating the matter.”
