CHENNAI: The directorate of medical education has decided to issue application forms for   only after  , while   harbour hopes of an   from the test for admission to state-run medical colleges.

 “We are conducting counselling for PG courses and have yet to begin the admission process for undergraduate courses,” Directorate of Medical Education selection committee secretary G Selvaraju said. “We hope to receive presidential assent exempting government medical colleges from NEET before that.”
 
 State health minister C Vijayabaskar, who in January moved bills in the assembly seeking exemption from NEET for PG and UG admissions in the state, has made similar assurances since March.
 
 CBSE conducted NEET across the country on a Supreme Court order on May 7 and 85,000 students from the state took the test. CBSE will release the results on June 8.
 
 Officials assured many parents and students that the authorities would exempt the state from NEET. They maintain that they are expecting news from Rastrapati Bhavan soon but Union ministers J P Nadda and Prakash Javdekar have insisted that the state will not receive any exemption.
 
 Many students have taken the Class XII exams and NEET, Sridharan Ramachandran, a parent, said. “We will be able to plan better if we have a clear picture of the admission process.”
 
 Associations of doctors, meanwhile, urged the government to cancel NEET because questions varied in difficulty with papers in different languages.
 
 “Those who [took the test] in Gujarati had the easiest paper whereas students in south India were given difficult questions in their regional languages,” PMK leader and former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Students who wrote the paper in Tamil were worst affected.”
 
 He requested Modi to press for presidential sanction of bills to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET.
