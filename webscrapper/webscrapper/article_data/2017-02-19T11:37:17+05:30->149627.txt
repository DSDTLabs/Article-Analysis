MUMBAI: The   (COA), looking into the day-to-day administration of the BCCI, wants to put a cap on massive spending by   on legal fees.

 The board has spent in excess of Rs 50 crore to fuel its battle in the   over the last two years. The sum ­ excluding the money that the state associations may have spent in their capacity while approaching the court ­ has left the COA sweating, it is learnt.
 
 The money that was taken into account, marked under legal expenses, isn't just based on the calculation of what was paid to the various senior counsels who've argued for the BCCI over the last two years. It involves billing of huge sums for hiring team of lawyers, the paperwork involved, stay , ticketing and more.
 
 “The COA wants to bring an end to this. Changing the Advocate on Record was the first step. The COA has now decided that BCCI will do away with all legal counsels whose services have been sought by the board in the past. Fresh legal teams will be brought on board as and when required.”
 
 For the record, very senior counsels like Aryaman Sundaram, KK Venugopal,  , Arvind Datar, Shekhar Naphade have represented BCCI in the past. In addition to this, the various committees appointed by the Supreme Court in recent years ­ be it the Mudgal Committee, the Lodha Committee and now the COA ­ have also been paid (and will be) from the BCCI coffers.
