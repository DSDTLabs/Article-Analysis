New Delhi : In what may unravel Pakistan  's alleged role in recent train derailments across India, a   (NIA) team reached Nepal on Thursday to interrogate prime suspect Shamsul Hoda, who was arrested by the Nepal police earlier this month, and three others in custody there. 

  The two-member NIA team will question Hoda over the next three days in the presence of Nepalese law enforcement agencies. Dubai-based Nepalese businessman Hoda unsuccessfully contested national elections in Nepal in 2013, but later turned to smuggling fake Indian currency and allegedly working with ISI to execute its terror plans against India. Hoda is expected to throw light on how ISI, through Karachi-based handler Safi Shaikh, allegedly persuaded him to cause mass killings in India by "engineering" stampedes, derailments, riots and attacking government installations. 
 
  Though Nepal police has shared details of his interrogation with NIA, the latter is looking forward to confronting Hoda as well as three others arrested earlier, including key Nepal-based link Brij Kishore, with some exclusive facts and claims made by arrested accused in India and known only to its own sleuths. "Hoda and Brij Kishore will help us corroborate the disclosure by Indian accused Motilal Paswan regarding a sabotage angle in the November 2016 derailment of   at Kanpur. Also, Hoda may throw light on ISI's suspected plot to blast tracks to trigger train accidents here, starting with a failed attempt at Ghorasan and followed by high-casualty derailments at Kanpur and, more recently, Koneru in Vizianagaram," said an officer of the central security establishment. 
 
 According to details that have emerged from initial probe by NIA into the failed Ghorasan bombings, Hoda was hosted by Pakistan's ISI at a Karachi safehouse around a year ago, with his travel and stay arranged by Safi Shaikh who he met in Dubai.
