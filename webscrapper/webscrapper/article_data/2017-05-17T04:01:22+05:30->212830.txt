YAVATMAL: An   query filed by one Suresh Mahadeo Dodke, hailing from village Borgaon, situated 15km from here, revealed a massive   in the implementation of Jawhar Sinchan Vihir Yojana (JSVY). The scheme is being implemented under the centre’s flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Agency (MGNREGA) programme.

 The then sarpanch of the village Vilas Motiram Gawande had approved construction of wells proposed by his wife Chhaya Vilas Gawande and son Bhushan Vilas Gawande. Accordingly, Chhaya and Bhushan received Rs3 lakh each for constructing wells in their farms at Ghat no106 and Ghat no 97.
 
 Interestingly, the rules prohibit sarpanch from sanctioning any projects for his family.
 
 Later, the mother-son duo submitted the bills of the construction cost to MGNREGA technical officer under the district deputy collector. According to the documents, the technical officer had examined construction sites from December 17-30, 2014 and January 2-15. 
 
 The then block development officer of   had cleared the bills and the amount obtained form the irrigation department of Zilla Parishad was released to the beneficiaries on March 30, 2015. 
 
 According to documents available with TOI, the bills were countersigned by the sarpanch, the gram secretary and the MGNREGA technical officer.
 
 However, when Borgaon’s talathi visited Ghat 97 and Ghat 106 on December 9 2016, the wells were missing. 
 
 Similar malpractices have been found in the implementation of the Baliraja Chetana Abhiyan in the district. The scheme is being implemented to thwart farmers’ suicide. 
 
 Recently, the chief executive officer Deepkumar Singla suspended over a dozen Gramsevaks over alleged malpractices.
 
 Senior officers including the executive engineer for irrigation Dinkar Pande, deputy CEO Rajesh Gayanar and the CEO Deepkumar Singla said that they were unaware of the multi-crore irrigation well scam.
