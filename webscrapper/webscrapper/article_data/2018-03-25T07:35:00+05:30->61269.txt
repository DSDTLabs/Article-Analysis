Chandigarh: Chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday hailed the state’s budget for the 2018-19 fiscal as a “milestone”, saying it focused on multi-sectoral growth. 

 He said he was confident that the budget would put the state on the path of “rapid growth”. “It will bring the state out of the vicious cycle of fiscal mess,” he said. 
 
 Amarinder said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP should first list even one tangible success during their decade-long “misrule”, and only then criticize the Congress. “They had completely ruined the state’s economy with their ill-conceived policies,” he said, adding that the current budget was not only progressive, balanced and people-friendly, but provided a roadmap to put the state’s derailed economy on track by ensuring all-round development of the state.
 
 “The present budget has taken due care of all sectors of the state, be it agriculture, industry, health, education, employment generation or, above all, the welfare of disadvantaged sections of society,” he said.
