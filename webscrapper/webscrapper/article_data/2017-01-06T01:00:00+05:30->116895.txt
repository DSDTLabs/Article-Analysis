There are very few occasions when   visits his home in  , but he keeps an eye on the changes in his locality, both good and bad. This time, while he was here, he noticed a dumpster opposite his house that was converted into a dumping ground, with trash overflowing on to the main road. On Tuesday, he tweeted the pictures of the area and appealed to the Delhi CM to take some action.

 Rahul told us, “I have been living in this area since I was eight. I keep travelling between Delhi and Mumbai now, but when I come to Delhi and I see this dumpster, which is now a dumping ground, right opposite a reputed school – there’s also a park there, it is on the main road in Saket – I wonder why there is no attempt to clean the area. We are living in the capital, and when we talk of cleanliness, we should be setting an example for other cities to follow. I just wanted to bring this to the notice of the authorities and the Delhi CM. After my tweet, I got a reply from Ankit Lal, who asked Pawan Sharma to look into it. Pawan Sharma’s tweet to me read, “@RahulDevRising Ji, BJP led MCD failed to keep city clean. I have informed our MLA for the same. Thanks for writing. @AnkitLal (sic).” I don’t want to get into politics, but as citizens, we have every right to draw the authorities’ attention to the issue.”

  Rahul’s tweet got more than 400 likes and to his surprise, within 24 hours, there was a team cleaning the area. “It looks like a miracle, but it feels good that the appeal was noted and swift action taken,” Rahul adds.
