PATNA: The Centreâ€™s decision to allow procurement of paddy even with 19% moisture content has given a big fillip to the paddy procurement drive as being done and managed by 6,598 Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACSs) and vyapar mandals active in the state, said deputy CM  .

 Modi said the central consumer protection department took the decision in this regard in December itself.
 
 Normally, the paddy procurement drive gets delayed in the state due to high content of moisture as paddy produced in   normally contains around 21-22% moisture. The moisture content is high during the early part of paddy harvest season, that starts from mid-November and pick up from mid-December.
 
 Traditionally, the Centre did not allow procurement of paddy having more than 17% of moisture content. In November last year, Union consumer protection minister Ram Vilas Paswan had indicated that the Centre would allow the procurement of paddy with 19% moisture content.
 
 As a result of it, the paddy procurement till January 2 this year has been 1.76 lakh metric tonne (MT) procured from 23,440 farmers. In contrast, 31,169 MT of paddy had been procured from 4,495 farmers around the same time in 2017.
 
 The update on the status was disclosed during the review of the current drive made by Modi with minister for cooperatives Rana   here on Friday. The cooperative department has been entrusted with the task of paddy procurement through PACSs and vyapar mandals active in the state, while food supply and consumer protection department is the nodal department in this regard.
 
 Modi also said the PACSs had already been given Rs500 crore, and the process has already been initiated for the release of another chunk of Rs600 crore, which would be given to PACSs and vyapar mandals at 8% interest rate.
