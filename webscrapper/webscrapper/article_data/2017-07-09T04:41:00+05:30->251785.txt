Nagpur: “The Rotary Club of Nagpur Central will reach out to senior citizens and conduct health check-ups and surgeries. We will also extend a helping hand to needy students by providing them with books and bicycles,” said Devidas Ghode, on Friday night.

 Speaking to TOI at a city hotel after assuming charge as president of Rotary Club of Nagpur Central, Ghode said that ensuring cleanliness and promoting eco-friendly immersion on Ganesh Chaturthi will be among the priority areas.
 
 Ghode said, “We were informed about our posts almost a year before the installation so that we could pick up the best cabinet members and plan out the tasks to be accomplished during our tenure. We will also undergo training to keep up with the standards of Rotary at international level.”
 
 The 25th annual installation ceremony also saw the other office-bearers take charge for 2017-18. District governor of Rotary International District 3030 Dr KS Rajan was the chief guest. Vikrant Tambe was installed as secretary. 
 
 Assistant district governor Kalpana Raje Bhosle, outgoing president Alok Vaidya, outgoing secretary Ramesh Pandagare and president-elect for 2018-19 Seema Srivastav were seated on the dais.
 
 This is Ghode’s third year in the club and reaching such heights in a short period is commendable, said past-president Sudhakar Bhalekar.
 
 “Ghode was elected unanimously looking at his active participation, leadership and socializing skills. He introduced new faces to the club too, who are very promising,” he added.
 
 “We have people from all walks of life and that makes the flow of work smooth and efficient,” he added. 
 
 An induction ceremony was also held to welcome 20 fresh members of the club. Past-district governors Raje Sangram Singh Bhosle, Ramesh Khanzode, Gopal Shiralkar and Vishwas Sahasrabhojanee were present.
