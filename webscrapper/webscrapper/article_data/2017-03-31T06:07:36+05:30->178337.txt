CHANDIGARH:   government on Thursday suspended deputy superintendent of police ( )   over corruption charges. An official of the police department said that Bandhu would remain in the office of   deputy commissioner of police ( ) during the period of suspension.

 DSP Bandhu was accused of taking a bribe in a rape case in Chandimandir area when he was posted there as an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in 2015. He had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 40 lakh to save the accused in the rape case.
 
 Two separate inquiries held by the   (rural) DCP and the DCP (crime) had indicted then ACP Bandhu for allegedly demanding Rs 40 lakh from a "rape accused", and threatening to frame him if the money was not paid.
 
 During the inquiry and scrutiny of call details and location, the senior police officers had found him in touch with the accused through some middlemen. Inquiries also revealed that when he failed to get the bribe money, he had verified the rape case as true.
 
 The case had also made headlines in June 2015, when then   commissioner of police O P Singh had written to the Haryana DGP seeking Bandhu's suspension. A corruption case was registered against him in August 2015.
