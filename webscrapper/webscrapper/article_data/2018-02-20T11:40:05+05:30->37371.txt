Sivakarthikeyan, who recently turned 33, has successfully established himself as one of the most bankable stars among the younger generation of the Tamil film industry. After showing off his acting prowess, the actor is all set to make a foray into production. 
Sivakarthikeyan will turn producer for a film which will be directed by his close friend and lyricist   of ‘Kabali’ fame.
 
 According to reports, the yet-untitled film is said to revolve around a young girl, who aspires to become a cricketer. Aishwarya Rajesh and Darshan will be seen in lead roles, while senior actor Sathyaraj will reportedly play a pivotal role in the film.
