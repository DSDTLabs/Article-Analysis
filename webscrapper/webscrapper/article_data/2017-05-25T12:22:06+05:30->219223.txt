BHOPAL:   took a dig at the government’s decision to change the   “Finally, some decision has been taken. But we still don’t understand why the chief minister’s love and obsession for   continues,” said PCC chief spokesman KK Mishra. This reaction came soon after chief minister   told the media on Wednesday that government will change the Sand Mining Policy 2015.

 “Mukhya mantriji kheti ko labh ka dhanda banana ke bajae reti ko labh ka dhanda banayenge (Instead of making agriculture a profitable venture like he had promised, does chief minister want to make sand mining lucrative)?” KK Mishra asked.
 
 Congress argued that the Opposition party is not surprised with the chief minister’s decision on sand mining. “All these announcements of banning sand mining in the Narmada and new policy is being made a fortnight before the onset of monsoons,” Mishra said. “NGT has prohibited sand mining from rivers during the monsoon. So in any case, the prohibition time is round the corner. Now there will be a shortage in the market and all the illegal mined sand will cost a whopping Rs 72,000 to Rs one lakh per truck like it happened last year,” he claimed.
 
 Mishra said that he is surprised that after all the exposure by the Congress party on sand mining in the state, no action has been taken against the culprits by either BJP high-command or the RSS. “Dumpers carrying illegally mined sand are caught when the RSS chief   was on an official tour in the state. Under what compulsion has the BJP-RSS turned deaf and blind to the issue,” Mishra asked.
