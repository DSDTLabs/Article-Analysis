New Delhi: After the   ( ), the   ( ) has come under scrutiny of the Supreme Court, which entertained a petition on Monday seeking to rid sports bodies of politicians and ministers.

 Senior advocate Shanti Bhushan, appearing for Delhi-based Kamlesh Verma’s  , told a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices   and   that the SC had frowned at the involvement of politicians, ministers and bureaucrats in management of sports organisations.
 
 Bhushan said the SC had barred politicians, ministers and bureaucrats from the BCCI and had appointed a committee of administrators (CoA) to manage the cricket body. He said a similar situation had arisen with the appointment of Himanta Biswa Sarma as interim president of BAI and requested the SC to appoint a CoA for the badminton body. Sarma was president of Assam Badminton Association and was appointed interim BAI president in April last year after the incumbent died.
 
 “Sarma is not only an MLA but also a minister in the Assam government and holds other important posts in BJP. As far as petitioner knows, Sarma has never been a badminton player at any level and thus, has no connection with the sport in any manner,” the petitioner said.
