NEW DELHI: The borewell sealing drive of the   has started targeting violations by bigger agencies.

 DJB has sealed 11 borewells at metro stations in eight sectors of  .
 
 Senior DJB officials said this enforcement action is just the beginning and they have listed around 348 borewells being operated by   without approval.
 
 “Three borewells belonging to Dwarka 21 metro station were sealed while one borewell each was sealed in sectors 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Dwarka. The action is being taken as per the directions of   in the ongoing case due to which around 800 borewells have been sealed so far.
 
 The only borewells that have been left in these stations were the ones that were opened after permission,” said a senior DJB official.
 
 The spokesperson of Delhi Metro, Anuj  , told TOI that there is no immediate crisis yet and remedial measures are being taken.
 
 “DMRC has already applied to the DJB seeking permission for 348 borewells out of which permission has been granted for 171 borewells. We will reapply to DJB for those borewells that have been sealed in Dwarka as sealing may cause inconvenience to our commuters and adversely affect the operations,” he said.
 
 Dayal added that two borewells at each station are essential because in case one fails, the other will be operational. One borewell has been sealed at most stations. In case of failure or malfunction, it takes five to six days to repair and in absence of the other borewells, water requirement would not be met putting severe strain on the operations.
 
 We will be taking up the matter with the authorities concerned,” Dayal said. On January 30, NGT directed the Delhi government to seal all unauthorised borewells in within three months.
 
 However, the action has been minimal as compared to the ground reality. Sources within DJB said that the real number of illegal borewells is in “lakhs”.
