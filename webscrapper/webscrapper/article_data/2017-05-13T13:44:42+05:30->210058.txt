KOLKATA: Even as '  3' hit the theatres on a warm Friday afternoon, residents in   got a closer look at Subhash Nagre, the character Amitabh   portrays in the film as the All Bengal   Fans' Association unveiled a life-size statue at a museum-cum-temple dedicated to the silverscreen icon.

 “For us, he is nothing short of God and a statue is the right way to worship him. Only someone with divine powers can wield such charisma and keep a nation mesmerized for five decades. That is why we literally worship him in this museum and offer puja,“ said   of the Fans' Association. Crafted by artist Subrata Bose, the statue captures Bachchan's `Sarkar' avatar in great detail. A section of his huge legion of fans, however, were disappointed.
 
 
 
 
 The statue finds place at the museum along with several items used by Bachchan, including a pair of white shoes that the star had sported in `Agneepath' and a throne from 'Aks'. “He has promised a watch a pair of sunglasses.We are expecting them later this month,“ said Kushal Dasgupta, general secretary of the association.
 
 It took Bose three months to make the 25kg statue. But will the actor ever get to see the statue? Not in the near future, said the association. “He knows about it and has even seen videos of the puja being offered to him at the temple. We plan to invite him but that can't happen very soon,“ said Dasgupta.
