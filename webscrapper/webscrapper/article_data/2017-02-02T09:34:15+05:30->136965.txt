LUCKNOW: Seema Mehra, who is organizing her daughter’s wedding this month, wouldn’t have known that the Budget could put a spanner in her plans. She wanted to gift a silver coin to each of her guests but the tax imposition of 12.5 per cent on silver would now force her to look for more  .

 An increase in the price of   has hit many like Seema. Adeesh Jain, president of the Sarrafa association of the city, said that though people would still buy traditional silver coins for weddings or other auspicious occasions, the price hike is expected to impact sales.
 
 “On regular days, 10-15 kilos of silver coins are sold in the city everyday whereas this number reaches 50-60 kilos during the wedding season. People rarely buy a single coin. Mostly they take it in bulk so I think the price hike would hit sales,” he said. 
 
 As for substitutes for silver coins, people are looking at silver notes, photo frames and small statues of deities.
 
 Riddhi Jain, a homemaker, said, “Silver notes have more visual appeal than coins and they will now be cheaper also, so why not go for something that suits the pocket as well as looks good.”
 
 Bank employee Shilpa Mehrota said, “Though silver coins have traditional significance but with the hike in their price I think I would look for something that is more cost-effective.”
