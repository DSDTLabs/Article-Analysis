AGRA: The 61-year-old head of the   of the reputed   here has been booked and arrested for allegedly raping the six-year-old daughter of a junior scientist in the institute. 

 Vishnu Dutt Sharma, who is set to retire in September, was apprehended on Monday evening. The alleged sexual assault occurred at the institute's staff quarters just 500 metres from Taj Mahal.
 
 According to police, for the last two-and-half months, Sharma was sexually assaulting the junior scientist's daughter. The six-year-old daughter of another scientist has levelled similar charges against Sharma.
 
 Shailender Singh, station house officer of Tajganj, said, "Since the accused is well-known and holds a respected post in the institute, nobody had any idea about the ongoing sexual abuse. Sharma used to lure the girl to his house almost every day, but on Monday evening her mother got suspicious and questioned the girl, who narrated the assault." Sharma and the girl are neighbours at the institute's quarters.
 
 "During investigations, we came across the six-year-old daughter of another junior scientist living next to Sharma's home, who said she too had been assaulted by him. Sharma has confessed to both allegations and even attempted to justify his crime," Singh added.
 
  On Tuesday, Sharma was sent to jail. He was booked under section 376 (rape) of IPC and section 3/4 of the POCSO Act. 
 
 The institute came into existence in April 1976 when the India Centre of Japanese Leprosy Mission for Asia (JALMA), established in 1966, was handed over to the government and subsequently to the Indian Council of Medical Research.
