CHENNAI: Four days after launching electronic payment of   fines to prevent confrontations between motorists and traffic  , commissioner   has suggested that the government permit the force and the transport department to impound   of repeat  .

 
 The police currently impound vehicles in fatal accidents. “We expect that impounding vehicles of repeat violators will act as a major deterrent to traffic offences,” a senior traffic police officer said. “We want to reduce traffic violations and ensure that enforcement of law is strict.”
 
 The electronic payment system, which the police introduced on Thursday, allows traffic violators to pay fines through credit or debit card, online banking and ecommerce payment system Paytm. Motorists booked by the police may also make payments at e-seva centres, post offices or in court.
 
 Violators who fail to pay fines within 48 hours of the receipt of e-challans can expect a knock on their door from a friendly local police officer.
 
 The police introduced the system to reduce the interaction, and consequent possibility of flare-ups, between the traffic police and motorists. More than 70% of violators have so far paid the fine within the stipulated time, police records show.
 
 The department has linked the machines that traffic police officers use to issue e-challans to a city police control room central server, which also has a database with records of offenders and violations. The traffic police can crosscheck data to more effectively track and punish repeat offenders and motorists who default on payment of fines.
 
 The police will treat a fine default as a violation in itself; three evasions of payments amounting to the equivalent of a repeat offence.
 
 The department is awaiting a government order that will allow traffic police officers to impound vehicles in such cases.
