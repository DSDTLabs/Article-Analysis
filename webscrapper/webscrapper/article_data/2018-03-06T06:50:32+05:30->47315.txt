BENGALURU: The new   (BCU) is mulling over introducing a five-year rigorous integrated science course at its   campus. 

 The course will see students graduate with a general BSc degree in science and an MSc in a specialization. The course introduced in the unified   a few years ago wasn't a huge hit. S Japhet, BCU vice-chancellor, said the university is yet to decide whether to allow students to leave the integrated course midway with a bachelor's degree. "We consulted a few professors from the Indian Institute of Science. Students keen on pursuing science long term will be interested in this course," he said, adding that the final call will be taken by the yet-to-be constituted Board of Studies.
 
 BCU has also applied for 20 additional departments, which if approved by the  , can start from the next academic session. Degrees in urban studies, public policy, digital media studies and animation are among the few courses on the anvil.
 
 T he department of skill development and entrepreneurship which would offer a bachelors and masters in vocational studies has been proposed. "There will be three- and two-year courses with a number of disciplines. The idea is to focus on hard and soft skills and to enhance employability. Degrees in vocational studies are currently offered in six colleges in our jurisdiction," he said. 
 
  The 20 departments, if approved, will be in addition to eight departments operating from the campus. Sixteen colleges have sought to be part of BCU for the next academic session and local inquiry committees (LIC) will visit them this month to check the feasibility.
