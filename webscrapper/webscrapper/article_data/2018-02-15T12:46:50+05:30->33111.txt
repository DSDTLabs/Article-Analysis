Madurai: Madurai district   has assured farmers of Periyar irrigation channel that water would be released to save their standing crops for about four days either on 16 or 17th of February. The farmers who were earlier denied permission to protest in   for water were invited by the collector to address their grievances on Wednesday.

 Member of the Periyar Planning Committee Arul   said that they had decided to stage a protest in front of the PWD office in Vadipatti demanding water. However the police intercepted them and prevented the protest. Later, the farmers were informed that a select group of them had been invited by the collector to hold discussions.
 
 “Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao has been very receptive to our demands. It is with his co-operation that we have been able to cultivate the crops to this level. Now he is our last hope as the crops need a few more days of water,” Prakasam said.
 
 Water that was released for irrigation to 45,000 acres of land from Peranai to Kallanthir in the Periyar irrigation channel was stopped on Feb 5. Paddy fields had started developing cracks and farmers who met the collector, urged him to release water just one more time, so that they could save atleast 80 per cent of the crops. 
 
 Even after monsoons last year, the water level in   went up to 130 feet, but the   dam’s level did not cross 60 feet. But water was diverted to the extension areas in Theni district, under political influence, depriving us our due. Now our crops in Madurai are in the danger of dying, said NA Karanam, a farmer.
 
 The water level in Mullai Periyar dam as per February 13 had been 114.25 feet and that of Vaigai dam was 39.27 feet. The farmers asked the collector to release water till the level touches 111 feet.
