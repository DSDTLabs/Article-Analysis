CHENNAI: The senior Brazil football team has always been one of the favourites in World Cups and it will be no different for their colts when they begin their Under-17 World Cup campaign against Spain on October 7 in Kochi.

 The last time that Brazil had won the Under-17 World Cup was way back in 2003 and they will be keen to win it back again. Their preparations are already underway back home under the supervision of coach   and the Under-17 players got a pleasant surprise on Tuesday when national coach  , commonly known as  , visited their camp.
 
 The 56-year-old Tite interacted with the boys for a lengthy period of time and had a few words of encouragement for the talented youngsters. A Brazilian spokesperson said that Tite told the boys that they are in safe hands (Amadeu). “Tite told them ‘Good work for you in India. I don’t like to say good luck, so I just say good work. You are in good hands’,” the spokesperson told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 The official also informed that they will be playing New Zealand in a warm-up tie ahead of the World Cup as part of their preparations. “We have already started our preparation in Brazil. We are going to finish our (final) preparation in Mumbai, where we will play two friendlies. One is against New Zealand and the other one is not decided yet,” the spokesperson said.
