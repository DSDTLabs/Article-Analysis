PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation ( ) will organize camps in all the 75 wards to create awareness among people about the student credit card yojana, self-help allowance and skill development programme. 

 These schemes come under the seven resolves (saat nischay) of chief minister Nitish Kumar namely ‘Arthik hal, yuvayon ko bal’. Interacting with the ward councillors at a meeting at the collectorate on Tuesday, Patna district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Agarwal asked them to organize a camp and assist the residents of their respective wards in getting the benefits of these schemes.
 
 One-day camp will be held in each ward from July 31 to August 8. Experts will tell students about the eligibility criteria and the process of applying for these schemes. They will be assisted in filling the form as well. 
 
 The DM said ward councillors have always been focusing on drainage and garbage issues, but they should also motivate people to take the advantage of these schemes and develop a healthy relation with them. 
 
 Till now, only 4,000 youths in Patna are availing the benefit of self-help allowance. The students get Rs1000/month for two years and 9,000 for getting training under the skill development programme. Around 400 students have also availed the facility of student credit card in which the state government is a guarantor for education loan of up to Rs4 lakh for higher studies from banks.
