COLVA: Will   and   who had publicly vowed during the Congress’ ‘Jan Jagruti Padyatra’ on December 9, 2016, to work for each other in case any of them bags the party candidature keep up to their promise or will they throw their hats into the electoral ring for the upcoming assembly elections 2017?

 This question was put to Pinto after the decision of the Congress to nominate Edwin Baretto as its candidate for Benaulim constituency. Pinto said he will now sit with his supporters and decide the future course of action.
 
 Barretto said that he has already contacted Pinto, but he will formally meet both the aspirants on January 16. Barretto said that his party has kept up its promise of giving an opportunity to new faces to contest elections and it is time for youngsters to join the party. 
 
 While praising the Congress leadership, GPCC office bearers, MLAs, voters of Benaulim constituency and especially the GPCC president, Barretto said that Luizinho Faleiro came with a vision to promote young faces which he has managed to accomplish.
 
 Reacting to the selection, Rebello said, “Faleiro betrayed me.” Commenting that she would contest as an independent, she said, “My supporters are forcing me to contest. They say they are not going to vote for the Congress.”
