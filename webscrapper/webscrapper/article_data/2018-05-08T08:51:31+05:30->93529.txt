MYSURU: Although the district saw a slide in the II PU rankings,   has managed to improve both its pass percentage and its position on the ranking table. Mysuru, which is the home district of both chief minister Siddaramaiah, and primary and secondary education minister Tanveer Sait, with a pass percentage of 83.58%, has jumped ten places in the district-wise rankings to the 11th spot, compared to last year.

 In 2017, Mysuru’s pass percentage stood at 72.29%. Although the district missed out on a slot in the top 10, the significant rise in the pass percentage and its rise in the chart have impressed officials in the department of public instruction, Mysuru. In all, 33,617 students – 16,700 boys and 16,917 girls – wrote the   exam in Mysuru. Predictably, girls have outshone boys, with 14,525 girls getting past the mark, against 11,344 boys.
 
 Pass percentage was higher among rural students compared to their urban counterparts. Of the 638 schools across the district, 68 including 20 government institutions managed to register 100% results. Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru, Mamatha attributed the district’s performance to the efforts of the students and teachers.
 
 Mixed bag for  
 
 Mysuru’s impressive performance in the SSLC exams this year only served to set Mandya’s in stark relief. With a pass percentage of 71.57% (against 71.73% in 2017), Mandya has slotted in 28th in the state-level rankings, while coming in last among all districts of South Karnataka.
 
 However, Hassan’s massive leap in pass percentage puts even Mysuru’s gains to shame. The pass percentage rose from 69.58% in 2017 to 84.68% this year, while the district’s rank jumped from 31 to seven. Deputy director of public instruction for   H Manjunath told TOI, “The primary reason for the improvement in the examination results is the collective efforts of al officials from the district administration including the DC, officials of the zilla panchayat, our officials, district institute of education and training (DIET) officers who are involved in preparing SSLC students. Everyone contributed towards improving the district’s performance.”
 
 Manjunath added, “We planned well, and executed them well. We had organised a meeting of the students’ mothers to ensure the students prepared for the exams.”
 
 Kodagu too registered a bump in the pass percentage, from 77.09% in 2017 to 80.68%. However, it dropped in the state-level rankings from ninth position to the 18th. The fate of Shivamogga too was similar, with the district seeing an improvement in the pass percentage from 75.07% to 78.75%, but slipping in the state-level rankings from the 15th to the 24th position.
 
 Considered one of backward districts in the state,   saw a slide in the rankings, and a decrease in pass percentage. While the district slipped 12 places in the state-level rankings from 12 to 24, its pass percentage decreased from 75.66% in 2017 to 74.47% in ‘18.
 
 Chikkamgaluru too faced a similar fate, with the district faring worse than Chamarajanagar, with a pass percentage of 72.47% and ending up 26th on the state-level rankings.
 
 An official from the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) told TOI that all districts in South Karnataka needed to introspect on their performance in the SSLC examinations. “All other districts have implemented several remedial measures to improve the pass percentage, and that is why they were able to climb the ladder,” he added.
