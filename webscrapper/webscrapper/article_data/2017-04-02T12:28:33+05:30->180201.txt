 Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) Associate Professor Dr Kshama Kedar, who will be taking up as the treasurer said, “Along the year, we will be counselling post graduate students on polishing their communication skills and attitude when it comes to dealing with patients and their relatives, since they are at the initial phase of taking up the big responsibility.”

 He added, “The theme of FOGSI this year is ‘She Matters … Care, Educate and Transform’ and theme for Nagpur Obstetrics & Gynaecological Society (NOGS) is ‘Stop Jousting”. In speciality organizations like this, intellectuals meet up and sometimes resort to back-biting. It can affect the image of a particular doctor and affects the brotherhood in the medical fraternity.”
 
 Public awareness programs will also be arranged to discuss burning issues and there also will be public participation to solve the issues. 
 
 The new team will be instated at the hands of Padmashree awardee Dr Vikas Mahatme. The ceremony will be organized at Hotel Centre Point, Ramdaspeth. Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) secretary Dr Hrishikesh Pai will be the guest of honour.
