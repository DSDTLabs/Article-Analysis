The upcoming track of the show  , the storyline will talk about the origins of Sai Baba's special Dhuni and the holy ash which is believed to have powers of healing. The actor who plays the lead role,   is himself a great follower and belives in the power of Vibhuti. In fact, he revealed that he always applies Vibhuti on himself.
 
 When asked about it, this is what the actor had to say:
 
 “Sai Baba worked in mysterious ways to help his devotees. He was known to cure life threatening illnesses with ayurvedic medicines and later, started distributing Vibhuti (Holy Ash). I remember every time that I have visited Shirdi, I have brought Vibhuti with me and there has never been a day that I have ventured out of my home without applying it. Sai Baba had said that the Dhuni will continue to be ablaze till the end of time. Till date, every devotee who visits Shirdi always takes Vibhuti along with them. I’m excited about the current track of Mere Sai as we have shown the story of Dhuni and its importance in the life of his devotees.”
 
 
 Mere Sai airs every Monday to Friday at 7.30 pm. Watch this space for more updates about the show.
