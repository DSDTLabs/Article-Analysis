Vadodara: Seven years after he fled from the city police custody, the police are likely to get the custody of drug dealer Xie Jeng Pang alias Richard. 

 The cops are preparing to leave for Hong Kong where Richard is lodged in the police custody since 2012. The police had been trying to extradite Richard who had fled from the city in 2011. 
 
 “After years of efforts, the court there has agreed to give us Richard’s custody. We are preparing to leave for Hong Kong to take his custody,” said Rahul Patel, assistant commissioner of police (crime) who has been supervising the case. The extradition will be a major accomplishment for the city police that had faced major embarrassment after Richard fled from its custody. 
 
 Richard was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officials along with two others in 2008 on Vadodara-Ahmedabad highway with 1.5 kg of methamphetamine - a stimulant drug. He was lodged in Vadodara central jail during the trial. When he was brought to SSG Hospital for medical treatment in April 2011, Richard escaped by diverting attention of the guards who were having snacks at a food-stall nearby. The escape seemed to have been a pre-planned affair as Richard fled on a motorbike. 
 
 Richard fled to Nepal where he was arrested by the local police. But before the police could extradite him, he again fled from Nepal police’s custody and reached Hong Kong. He was arrested there for committing some offence. 
 
 Before his escape, interrogation of Richard had led NCB to Sakhi Organics in Savli where they found 110 kilograms of methamphetamine. Richard was interrogated in detail and then was sent to judicial custody in Vadodara Central Jail. Richard is a Chinese by origin but is Canadian national. He had convinced Kirit Shah, owner of Sakhi Organics to manufacture methamphetamine for earning quick money. Shah too was nabbed by NCB later.
