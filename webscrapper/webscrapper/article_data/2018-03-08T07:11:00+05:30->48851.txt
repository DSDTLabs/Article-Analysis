GURUGRAM: A group of environmentalists has met the director general of forests to demand action against the   after TOI highlighted that it has not obtained permission for the   from the ministry of environment and forest. 

 Vaishali Rana Chandra,  , Shivani Sharma and others met Siddhanta Das, DG, forests, after a forest department reply to an RTI query showed that no detail of the land acquired by the MCG for the plant was available with it. The land in Bandhwari falls under Aravalis Notification, 1992, and as per norms, MCG needs environmental clearances from the union ministry to use it for non-forest activities.
 
 An official of the ministry said, “We have assured environmentalists that a meeting of officials in the state government will be called to discuss the issue. The roles of the Union ministry and the state government are well defined. While the state has to work on waste management as per its plan, a permission is required if forest land is being diverted for non-forest activities.”
