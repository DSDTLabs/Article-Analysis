NEW DELHI: A GoAir Airbus A-320 new   option (Neo) with Pratt and Whitney engines made an emergency landing in Delhi on Tuesday morning after developing a snag in one of the engines.

 The Mumbai-Delhi flight with 183 passengers landed safely with the air traffic control giving it priority landing and the airport lining up emergency vehicles along the runway.
 
 This latest P&W   erupted just days after another GoAir A-320 Neo had a fire scare which saw the plane return to Delhi minutes after taking off for Bangalore last Wednesday.
 
 “The captain of flight G8 329 did a normal landing at Delhi airport. However due to a technical snag on the air bleed system he had to reduce the power on left engine and had requested for emergency assistance during landing. The aircraft landed safely at 8.06am with 183 passengers. After initial inspection the snag was rectified by replacing a component. The aircraft has been cleared for operations,” a statement by GoAir said.
 
 The airline said that the Tuesday incident did not involve engine failure. A senior official of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) confirmed that, saying: “There was an issue with the air valve which was replaced. There was no engine failure this time.”
 
 IndiGo is also facing similar troubles with its A-320 Neo that have P&W engines. Both these airlines are in touch with the engine manufacturer and the Indian aviation regulator is also studying the problem with P&W engines.
 
 TOI had last Saturday sent queries to P&W about the issues plaguing its A-320 Neo engines and what the company was doing to resolve them. It has so far not commented on that. P&W has witnessed problems like slow engine startup times and erroneous engine software messages in the new engine. This had led to a delay in delivery of the Neo to customer airlines.
