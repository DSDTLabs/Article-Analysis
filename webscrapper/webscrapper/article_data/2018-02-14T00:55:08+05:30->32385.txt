Jaipur: Chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Monday announced a waiver for farm loans up to Rs 50,000 taken by small and marginal   from co-operative banks. The sop to woo agitating farmers will cost the state exchequer Rs 8,000 crore and benefit 20 lakh farmers, she said while announcing the budget for 201-8-19.

 However, the budget makes a provision of only Rs 2,000 crore for the loan waiver. When asked, a senior government official told TOI that loans of the small and marginal farmers up to Rs 50,000 will be waived completely by the cooperative banks and the government will provide the funds to these banks in a phased manner.
 
 “The provision of Rs 2,000 crore does not mean the government will not require additional funds. The rest liability of Rs 6000 crore will be paid off to the banks in a staggered manner,” the official said.
 
 The BJP-led state government has also earmarked Rs 544 crore for providing short-term crop loans and interest rate subvention.
 
 Criticizing the debt relief as an eye wash, state Congress chief Sachin Pilot on Monday said the loan waiver would not benefit a large segment of the farmers the government is aiming to reach as much of the loans had been provided by scheduled banks.
 
 However, a top source in the state finance department said the majority of the farmers, or around 60%, in the small and marginal category took short-term crop loans from cooperative banks.
 
 Even the loans taken from cooperative societies are not included in the waiver. But sources said Rajasthan has adopted the Kerala model in introducing the scheme with a farmers’ loan relief commission which will take up various grievances of the farmers.
 
 “The commission will engage the nationalized banks and state government departments to find out ways possible solutions to provide further relief to indebted farmers,” added the official.
