PATNA: Resentment prevails among hundreds of BTch students of 2013-17 batch of Maulana Azad College of Engineering and Technology ( ) at Bihta on the outskirts of Patna over alleged irregularities in their final results. 
 
 A day after agressive protests at the college’s head office at Aneesabad in Patna, a delegation of six students along with MACET officials Masood Ahmad and Mohd Reyaz went to the Magadh University (MU) HQ at   to discuss the students’ grievances with the university authorities. 
  
 On Tuesday, hundreds of angry students protested at the college office at   and reportedly held the teachers captive till 10pm. Though police came, they did not use force at the request of the college officials as the students were not violent. 
  
 Patna SDO (sadar) Bhavesh Mishra also visited the spot. “We asked the college officials to go to the MU HQ and plead for a relook into the results. I also asked them to request the MU authorities to show the answer sheets of the failed students,” SDO Mishra was quoted by the students to have told them. 
  
 The students alleged raw deal. “Our exams ended in July 2017. The results were expected in October, but they came last week,” an Electronics and Communication department student told TOI and added some students have been shown to have flunked because they scored just one mark in a theory paper, which is just unbelievable. 
  
 Another civil engineering branch student rued he lost a new-found job. “I had been placed in a reputed construction firm, but was fired after I failed,” he said. 
  
 MU’s controller of examinations  , on the other hand, denied any irregularity. “The students’ scores are based on their performance in the examination,” he said.
