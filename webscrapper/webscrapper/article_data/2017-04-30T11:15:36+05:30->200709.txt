HYDERABAD: After the   in  ,  , was closed a decade ago, vendors are slaughtering animals at a nearby tin shed and are throwing the waste into Musi lake. 

 The waste gets accumulated at the corners of the lake, creating a nightmare for residents. They allege meat vendors of risking their health by dumping waste into the lake. "The stink emanating from the lake is leading to respiratory diseases among children and senior citizens. The flies have become a bigger menace," said  , a resident of Ziyaguda. The premises of the market are in pathetic condition with sights of bones and animal skin littered all over the place. Most commuters have stopped using the road for this reason. "I try to avoid the road because it is disgusting to travel through piles of bones every morning", said Vishnu Vardhan a resident of Puranapul.
 
 Three gates of the Muslim Jung Pool Bridge near Begum Bazar were blocked on Saturday due the dump. "This is not the first time the gates have been blocked. We also came across bodies of animals while cleasring the gates," said a   official. Vendors and hawkers at Ziyaguda meat market near Puranapul are suffering since years due to lack of basic facilities and amenities such as shelter washrooms and water inside the market. 
 
 The market, popularly known as  , has been a bread earner for more than 100 families. Several of them want the slaughter house to reopen.
