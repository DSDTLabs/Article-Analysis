BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court passed an interim order of injunction on Wednesday, restraining the authorities from issuing the final notification to declare   forest a conservation reserve, as a public interest petition has been filed.

 A division bench headed by Chief Justice   ordered notices to the state government, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife),   and deputy commissioner of Gadag in response to the PIL filed by   and five others.
 
 According to the petitioners, a public consultation meeting was held on January 16 at Dambala village, Mundargi taluk in Gadag district, but the authorities did not allow the public to participate. The detailed objections were not considered before the matter was referred to the Karnataka Wildlife Board.
 
 They said that the public notice for the consultation meeting was not published in widely-circulated local newspapers as required under section 36A of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. It was notified only at the DCâ€™s office and only a few local politicians and religious heads were aware of it. The meeting was held at an institution belonging to a local religious head, at whose behest the move to declare it a conservation reserve was taken up.
 
 The petitioners said there are more than 33 villages in and around Kappatagudda and 1.17 lakh people, largely from poorer sections, live here. Most residents are dependent on cattle and sheep rearing or subsistence agriculture for a living.
 
 The petitioners alleged that the government allowed setting up of 250 windmills to generate power but is now trying to make a decision that will be detrimental to the villagers.
