AHMEDABAD: About 800-odd families who were displaced for Panam-Hadaf Kabotari Alwada irrigation dam are still waiting for their land ownership rights for the last 22 years. The government on Monday said that the process was in the final stage.

 During the question hour, Godhra MLA C K Raulji sought to know from the government when the government would be able to give land rights to the families who were displaced for the project. Revenue minister Bhupendrasinh   said that 479 families are yet to be given their land rights.
 
 Raulji said that the issue was getting delayed as there was no coordination among the revenue, forest and the irrigation departments. Raulji further demanded that an officer should be appointed to ensure that the families get justice.
 
 Chudasama informed the house that the central government had in 2011 given the conditional approval to give the forest land to the families and in lieu of the forest land, the government has already given land to the forest department in Jamnagar and other parts of the state.
 
 Chudasama further said that a proposal for final approval has been sent to the Union government. He said if required, he would meet the Union ministers and ensure an early solution. He even said that he would even hold a meeting with all the departments concerned.
