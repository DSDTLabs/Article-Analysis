LUCKNOW: After an EC decision forced an end to the extended feud between his father Shivpal Yadav and cousin CM Akhilesh Yadav, Aditya Yadav on Wednesday tweeted for unity in the family.

 The tweet, in the form of a poster, has the photographs of   patriarch Mulayam Singh, national president Akhilesh Yadav and that of senior leader Shivpal Yadav followed by a message: “Uttar Pradesh Ke Teevra Aur Samagra Vikas Ke Liye Hum Sabhi Ko Milkar Yogdan Karna Hoga“ (We will have to come together and contribute for rapid and overall development of UP).
 
 The social media message is being seen as the first sign of rapprochement between the families of ousted SP state president Shivpal Yadav and his nephew and now party chief Akhilesh Yadav. Though Aditya, who is presently serving as chairman of the   (UPPCF), is known to be close to Akhilesh and his family , he has stood firmly by his father all through the infighting within the SP's first family .
 
 Earlier, there were reports that Shivpal may not contest the Assembly elections from Jaswantnagar, from where he is the sitting MLA, and may give away his seat to Aditya. SP patriarch  's wishlist of 38 candidates that he had handed over to Akhilesh on Tuesday , initially had Aditya's name from Jaswantnagar fuelling speculations that Shivpal may be accommodated at a respectable post in party's national executive and eventually find a seat in the Rajya Sabha.
 
 However, later Mulayam learnt that Shivpal was interested in contesting the Assembly polls after which he included his name in the list in Aditya's place.
