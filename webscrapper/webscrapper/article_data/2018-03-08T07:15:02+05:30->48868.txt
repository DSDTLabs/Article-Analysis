BENGALURU: Four days after Indian Forest Service officer   was trampled to death by a wild tusker in   forest range near Mysuru, the BBMP council on Wednesday decided to rename   in Malleswaram as as Manikandan, IFS Road.

 The road runs in front of Aranya Bhavan, the headquarters of the Karnataka forest department.
 
 The proposal was mooted by Manikandan’s IFS colleague Manoj Rajan, currently special commissioner with the BBMP and council members agreed unanimously. The change in name comes into effect immediately.
 
 Manikandan, 46, conservator of forests and director,   Tiger Reserve, died on March 3. He was a 2001 batch officer and hailed from Madurai, Tamil Nadu. He’s survived by his wife, son and daughter. He was posted to Nagarahole two years ago.
 
 The officer had gone to assess damage caused by a fire allegedly set by miscreants. Officers said Manikandan, forest range officer Subramanya Swamy and around 15 staff were taking GPS readings of the blaze when an elephant charged out of a bush.
 
 Manikandan and his colleagues had got off their jeep and were walking when the elephant attacked him from behind. While others managed to escape, Manikandan was trampled to death. The staff tried to drive away the elephant.
 
 Even before the staff lifted Manikandan and shifted him to HD Kote Government Hospital, he had breathed his last. Foresters rushed him to Hosahalli Gate checkpost, the border of the tiger reserve, to a waiting ambulance.
 
 “Manikandan knew a lot about animals, particularly those found in the Nagarahole forest. He was documenting every elephant in the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve,” said forest officials who worked with him.
