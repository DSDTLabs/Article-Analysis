RANCHI: Students pay little   compared to the remaining subjects in Class XI and XII. But they fail to realise that English can help them score good marks and increase their overall percentage, thereby increasing their chances of getting admission in a good institute.

 Time management is the biggest problem faced by students during the English examination as they find the paper lengthy. The best way to tackle this problem is to decide how much time one should give to each section of the paper, which comprises reading, writing and literature. Distributing equal time to all three sections and solving sample papers will give students an overall idea about the pattern of the paper.

Students usually do not practice reading these questions before the examination, thinking the comprehension section will be different every year. While this is true, solving questions from this section will only help students understand the pattern better and will get them into the habit of reading faster. Using the correct format is very important in the writing section.
