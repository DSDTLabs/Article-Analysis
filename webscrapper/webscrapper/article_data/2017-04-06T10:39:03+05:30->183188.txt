PANAJI: The   ( ) has organized tough friendlies for the football squad ahead of the   later this year.

 Portuguese coach   has told the AIFF that he wants to test the boys against teams who are expected to feature in the U-17 World Cup and the federation has responded by arranging friendlies with the U-17 national teams of Italy and Portugal during their month-long tour to Portugal later this month.
 
 If things go according to plan, there will also be friendly matches against national teams from Hungary and Morocco, besides participation in the Lazio Cup where highly-competitive teams like Fiorentina, Partizan Belgrade, Sparta Prague and Qatar Aspire Academy are known to showcase their skills.
 
 "I want matches against strong teams. I don't mind losing all matches now for a win in the World Cup opener. There are coaches who avoid difficult opponents but that will not give us a correct picture of our strength. I want to watch these players make mistakes and prepare them for the dangers ahead," Luis had told TOI in a previous interview.
 
 The India U-17 team are currently training in Goa but will move to Mumbai for a couple of days before packing their bags for Portugal on April 10 where they will be based for more than a month.
 
 "We have a problem (training here). May is very hot and the monsoon starts in June. It's difficult (to train) during the rains. We must go to places where we can train normally with good weather and have good teams to compete with," said Luis.
 
 The former Portugal striker who was recommended for the India job by Manchester United coach   and Portugal's Euro 2016 winning coach   took over last month following the departure of German coach Nicolai Adam, accused of abusing the players, physically and verbally.
