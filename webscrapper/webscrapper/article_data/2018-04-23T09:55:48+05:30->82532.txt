NEW DELHI:   survived a late assault from   to seal a thrilling four-run win in an   (IPL) match on Sunday. Set a target of 183, SRH managed 178/6 in their allotted 20 overs as CSK climbed to the top of the points tally.

 
 
 
 
 That SRH came close to winning the match was thanks largely to their captain   who scored a valiant 84 off 51 balls after their chase was jolted by three early blows. Deepak Chahar dismissed opener Ricky Bhui and Manish Pandey for a duck in successive overs and then added the scalp of Deepak Hooda (1) in his third to leave SRH in trouble at 22/3 in 4.2 overs.
 
 
 
 
 
 Williamson then first combined with Shakib Al Hasan (24) to revive the innings before adding 79 runs with big-hitting   (45) to bring them back in the contest. When he fell to Dwayne Bravo off the final delivery of the 18th over, SRH needed 33 off the final two overs. 
 
 However, the fall of Yusuf in the following over all but ended the hopes of the home fans before Rashid Khan gave CSK a mighty scare. With 19 needed off the final over, Rashid struck a six and a four to leave his team needing six from the last delivery. However, he managed a single off it to remain unbeaten on 17 as CSK took home two points.
 
 However, CSK's final total of 182/3 looked a distant possibility when they crawled to 41/2 in 9 overs after being asked to bat first at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. A strategic time-out worked in the visitor's favour with   (79) and Suresh Raina (54*) shifting gears as soon as the play resumed. In the next 11 overs, CSK went on a rampage to loot 141 runs in them. Rayudu was the aggressor-in-chief but was run out in an unfortunate manner. Raina though remained unbeaten and found good support from captain MS Dhoni who contributed with 25* off 12.
