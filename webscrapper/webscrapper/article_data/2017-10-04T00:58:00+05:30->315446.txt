Trichy: Fire and rescue personnel rescued two pythons from residential localities near Ponnamaravathy in Pudukkottai district on Tuesday.

 A 10-feet long python was spotted by Anganvadi workers in Sundaram village when it entered their premises. They immediately alerted the fire and rescue service personnel. A team from Ponnamaravathy rushed to the spot and rescued the python. It was handed over to the forest personnel, who let it free into the nearby Thothoor malai reserve forest.
 
 Similarly, another python was found near a house in Vegupatty village. It was rescued by the villagers and handed over to the forest personnel. It was let into the Kanchathu malai reserve forest.
 
 While this is the first time that a big snake was sighted in Vegupatty, senior forest personnel at Ponnamaravathy said there were several such incidents in the recent times where pythons entered residential habitat. 
 
 While it primarily comes in search of prey, the forest official said that availability of cattle and hens make these pythons invade residential localities. 
 
 On most occasions, the pythons that are rescued and let free into the forest, make their way back to the residential localities.
