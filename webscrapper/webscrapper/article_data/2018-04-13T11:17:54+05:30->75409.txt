HYDERABAD: A day after angry teachers and students protested against a gaushala being set up inside the government primary school in  , authorities ordered a probe into the matter.

 The protesters had complained that poor students from the   locality were at the receiving end of the apathy of authorities.
 
 “Citing temple renovation and repair work, the school was shifted to   school building with an assurance that it would be moved back to its old location. On January 21, the school was vacated. But when we returned today, we found that a gaushala has been set up inside the school premises. The foul smell was so bad that it compelled us to leave our classroom and sit outside the school,'' said school headmaster Padmalata.
 
 The school authorities have sought education minister Kadiyam Srihari’s immediate intervention to ensure the removal of the gaushala or relocation of the school at a site in the same locality as they fear the prevailing unhygienic atmosphere may lead to students suffering from health problems.
 
 “The government provides midday meals to pupils, but having meals in such an ambience is not acceptable,'' said Padmalata.
 
 Many parents also objected to the unhygienic conditions prevailing inside the school premises and expressed fears that it may affect the health of their children. “My daughter studies in this school and relocating the school will cause problems. It would be much better if the school continues in the same place but in a healthy atmosphere,” said  , one of the parents.
 
 The authorities concerned have been asked to find out who is responsible for setting up the gaushala inside the school premises and that action be taken against them.
 
 The school was inaugurated in 1998 and all the related documents submitted to the concerned officials.
