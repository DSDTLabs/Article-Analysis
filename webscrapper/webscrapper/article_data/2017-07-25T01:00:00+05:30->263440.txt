In a casting coup of sorts, director Milan Luthria has got   to shake a leg with   in his upcoming film, ' '. The duo will feature in a special song, ' ', which also marks Emraan’s introductory portion in the movie. 
On his part, Milan says that the idea of having an item number just for the sake of it has never been exciting for him. “The song has to be special and there has to be a connect,” he says, adding, “'Piya More' is a   number but the way Emraan and Sunny have done it, makes it nice and different. It’s not sleazy, they have lent a fun vibe to it. For me, the chemistry they share is the USP of this song.”
 The song, composed by  , penned by Manoj Muntashir and rendered by   and  , releases today. Set in the blue lanes of Jodhpur ( ), the large palette of colours add to the visual appeal of the song. What also makes it interesting is that it mixes folk music with the style of the 50s and 60s. As the filmmaker explains, “When the song starts, you feel as if it’s playing on the radio. The first line will take you back to the Shamshad Begum era and then, the dance begins. Many people tend to feel that it’s a recreation, but it’s an original composition.”
