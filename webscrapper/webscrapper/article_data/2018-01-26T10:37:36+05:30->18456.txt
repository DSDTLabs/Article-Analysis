TRICHY: Officials of the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption ( ),   seized unaccounted cash worth Rs 2.58 lakh from touts at the regional transport office ( ) unit at   in Trichy on Thursday afternoon. 

 The seizure was made when a team of sleuths made a surprise visit to the office acting on a tip-off. On sensing their arrival, the touts operating inside the office attempted to give them the slip. However, the cops managed to catch seven touts and confiscate Rs 2,58,500 from them. The unit office at Musiri is headed by a motor vehicle inspector and comes under the administrative control of Srirangam RTO. No one was arrested. 
 
 A source said that the raid was necessitated by information received about the practice of bribes being given to RTO officials through touts to get works done. DVAC officials were interrogating the touts as well as the officials. An RTO source said that unused registration numbers meant for government departments were to be released for two-wheelers and four-wheelers at the Musiri office on Thursday. The government-fixed price would range from Rs 2,000 to Rs 16,000 besides which the officials charged more as bribe through touts. This was the main reason for carrying out the raid. 
 
 It may be recalled that DVAC had carried out raids at Trichy Srirangam, Trichy-East and Trichy-West RTOs and seized unaccounted cash from the touts and MVIs last year. Cases were also registered against the touts. 
 
  had reported the rampant bribery culture prevailing in the three RTOs in Trichy in December 2017. Bribe was charged for each and every service provided to the public and touts who moved around the campus at will were hand-in-glove with the officials concerned.
