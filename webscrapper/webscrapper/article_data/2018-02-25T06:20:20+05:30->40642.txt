KARWAR: The 31-year wait of hundreds of families for compensation for the land they lost to the Seabird Naval Project is finally coming to an end. 

 Defence minister Nirmala  , while disbursing Rs 2 crore to 90 displaced families in   on Saturday, told the gathering that the compensation will reach them in full soon as the Centre has cleared decks for the release of Rs 534 crore in reparation.
 
 The defence minister slammed previous governments for dragging the displaced to court rooms by denying them fair compensation. According to Sitharaman, it is the present Union government under the leadership of PM   that released Rs 534 crore towards compensation in record time.
 
 Sitharaman said the ministry of defence released Rs 207 crore towards settling 858 cases. The Defence Estate Officer (DEO) in Bengaluru has deposited Rs 154 crore, as of February 23, with the Karwar district administration. "The remaining amount of Rs 53 crore will be deposited by the DEO in three days," she said.
 
 During her visit to Karwar last December, she had asked the DC to send all files pertaining to pending compensation cases before February.
