LUCKNOW: For the first time in its history ever since it was set up in 1897, the famed   of Lucknow is  . The shops that were selling   that went into the mouth-watering  ' have been closed as they were running without a valid licence, forcing Tunday to make the biggest-ever change in its menu. 

 In this city of nawabs, there are many eateries like Tunday who have made fundamental changes in their platter because of acute shortage of buffalo meat. Raheem's is selling nahari made of mutton for the first time since 1890. Similarly, Mubeen's has to reluctantly stick to chicken and mutton variants only.
 
 Haji Raees Ahmad, the owner of Tunday Kebabi and the grandson of the legendary Haji Murad Ali, said on Tuesday night, he had sufficient buffalo meat for the kebabs. But that lasted till Wednesday evening. Consequently, they had to shut shop for a few hours.
 
 Haji Zubair Ahmad, the owner of Raheem's, said he had never imagined that one day he would be forced to sell pasanda made of chicken due to non-availability of buffalo meat.
 
 On Wednesday evening, Haji Raees' nephew checked many shops and slaughterhouses, but was not able to get even a kilo of buffalo meat due to the shutdown. On Thursday, when TOI visited Tunday's shop, the platter had chicken kebabs, which were much costlier than galawati kebabs.
 
 Food lovers were a disappointed lot when they found Tunday's signature dish missing. Roopak Yadav, a youth who visited the shop at Chowk with his friends, said: "I was hopeful of getting galawati kebabs. It is heart-breaking that Tunday's are selling chicken kababs."
