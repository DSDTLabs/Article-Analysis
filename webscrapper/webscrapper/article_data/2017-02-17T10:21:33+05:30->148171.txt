BHUBANESWAR: In the wake of the Congress' dismal performance in the first two phases of panchayat election, senior party leader and former state president Niranjan Patnaik attributed the debacle to direction-less leadership and incompetence of the leaders.

 "From top to bottom, we are all responsible for the party's poor performance. We failed to reach out to the people in time. Preparations by leaders started late," Niranjan told mediapersons here on Thursday. 
 
 While results of the first two phases are yet to be announced by the  , the trends indicate the Congress bagged only around 27 zilla parishad (ZP) seats so far. In 2012, the Congress had won 45 ZP seats after the end of first two phases of elections. 
 
 "To some extent, Delhi is responsible. Our central leadership should have properly supervised our preparations. We never imagined we would face such an embarrassing defeat. The results exposed incompetence of our leaders," Niranjan said. 
 
 Congress whip Taraprasad Bahinipati also found flaw with the party's state leadership. 
 
 "We failed to perform due to lack of coordination among party cadres and leaders in grassroots. The leadership failed miserably," Bahinipati said. 
 
 The Congress is in the news for prologed infighting. While the BJD and the BJP pulled up their socks months before the polls, Congress leaders were busy in Delhi complaining against each other to the central leadership.
 
 In October-November last year, the factional war between   (OPCC) president   and another group led by  , who is also the leader of opposition, reached a flashpoint. 
 
 The two met   multiple times amid speculation that a section of MLAs led by Narasingha complained against Prasad. 
 
 Though Rahul apparently refused to change the OPCC leadership, the differences continued with both of them holding separate meetings on poll preparations. Many within the Congress perceive Prasad's leadership is weak.
