HYDERABAD: Angry and anguished, the family of   who committed suicide in the US, beat up his wife Swathi, in Bhongir on Tuesday.

 The body of Madhukar Reddy was brought to his home town for last rites. When Swathi arrived at the house, her in-laws and relatives beat her up in full public view alleging that she was responsible for Madhukar's death.
 
 Both Madhukar Reddy, an  , and Swathi, were employed in the US and they have a seven-year-old daughter. Madhukar was found hanging in his home in Seattle on April 4.
 
 According to sources in Seattle, no complaint was lodged with the local police when Madhukar was found dead at his house. “No   was carried out here,“ a source from the US told TOI.
 
 After the attack, Swathi lodged a complaint with the Bhongir police. Dismissing her in-laws' allegations of foul play behind Madhukar's death, Swathi said her husband had been going through a lot of depression for the last one year.
 
 She told a TV channel that she herself had asked for divorce because of his mood swings. “I told his parents to come to the US and observe him. If his behaviour towards me was abnormal, it meant that he was no longer interested in me and the way out was divorce,“ she said.
 
 Swathi said Madhukar responded to her text message on April 4. In the afternoon also he replied cheerfully . “However, when I went home in the evening, I found him hanging,“ she said.
 
 Swathi said she had medical records of Madhukar to prove that he was undergoing psychiatric counselling. She said one of the reasons for his depression was that the family was losing land in Bhongir, and the main reason was `work related' as he himself had told doctors. She also said he had worried that his siblings had not returned large sums of money that they had taken from him. “The down payment for the house we bought in the US was made from my earnings,“ she said.
