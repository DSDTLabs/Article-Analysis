BENGALARU: Summer has set in, and how! In what are still the initial days of summer, the temperature has shot up by   in just three days. The   has been so sharp that it is threatening to breach the all-time record for March.

 On Saturday, the city recorded a high of 34.4 degrees Celsius, almost two degrees above the month’s normal of 32.5 degrees and only three degrees short of the all-time high of 37.3 — recorded on March 29, 1996. On March 1 this year, the city recorded a high of 33.2 degrees Celsius. On Sunday, the   dipped marginally to 34 degrees Celsius.
 
 Last year too, March saw relatively fierce temperatures with the mercury touching a high of 37.2 degrees Celsius.
 
 Geeta Agnihotri, scientist and director-in-cha-rge at the  , said with skies remaining clear over the city, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 34 and 18 degrees Celsius respectively. “Bengaluru is currently experiencing a two-degree departure in the maximum temperature from the normal,” Geeta said.
 
 
 
 
 Scientists at the   State Natural Disaster Management Centre attribute the spike in temperature to the dry weather and clear skies.
 
 “Bengalureans are not feeling the actual heat as the wind is still blowing from east to west and carries some moisture,” a scientists explained. “The heat is felt only between noon and 4pm. It will be harsher if the wind starts blowing from north to south. Normally, we witness such wind flow (north-south) only April onwards. But this year, there are indications of it happening earlier. It is because of this advanced change in the wind direction that the winter was colder than normal.”
 
 The weatherman says if the temperature goes beyond 34 degrees Celsius, there are chances of light showers, but it may not do much to help reduce the heat.
