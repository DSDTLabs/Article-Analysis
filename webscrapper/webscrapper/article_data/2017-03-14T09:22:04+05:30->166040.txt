HYDERABAD: The stage is set for a power tariff hike as the TRS government refused to allot additional funds in the budget as sought by the power utilities. The Telangana discoms had asked for 7,150.12 crore to meet the agriculture subsidy as they are forced to supply power free to the farm sector. However, against the demand, the state government has allotted 4,203.21 crore, which is less than last year's allocation. For 2016-17, the state government had extended 4,500 crore to the discoms. With this, it is clear that the two discoms will be asked to increase power tariff to meet their energy demand. 

 In all, the state government ought to have allotted at least 7,000 crore to ensure that there is no tariff hike in the ensuing year. With reduced allocations, the discoms will now propose a tariff hike to earn at least 2,900 crore! "We have already given counter guarantee for the loans raised by the discoms under UDAY scheme. This will save about 850 crore to the discoms," said a senior official of the finance department. Even after deduction of this amount, there will still be a gap of 2,050 crore, which would require the power utilities to effect more than 15% tariff hike for all consumers. 
 
 It was in the hope of a bailout from the state government that the discoms did not file their tariff proposals with the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC), for which they incurred the apex commission's wrath. The ERC, in an unprecedented move, threatened to fix tariff suo motu after the discoms failed to meet the deadline thrice.
 
 "We are trying to ascertain the total agriculture burden and the revenue gap after taking the benefit of the Uday scheme into account. We will file the revised tariff proposals in a few days. But with reduced budget allocations, a tariff hike is imminent. But it will not come into effect from April 1," said a senior energy department official.
