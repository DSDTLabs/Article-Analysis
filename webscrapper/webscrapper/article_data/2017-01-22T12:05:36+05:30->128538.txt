With rumours of   being adapted into a trilogy on-screen,   fans worldwide were happily looking forward to this creative treat. But looks like Potter-fans would now have to wait a bit longer to see their favourite book character on the big screen again. Putting rumours to rest J.K. Rowling, the author of the popular Harry Potter series, clarified on her official website that this piece of information is absolutely false. Rowling instead said that there are no plans of converting the play script into a movie, anytime soon.
 
  "A   has made its way all the way into the press that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will be made into a   â€“ and not just one film! A trilogy, with Dan, Emma and Rupert returning to their original roles, to be released in 2026... I have no idea how these stories emerge, but to set the record straight once and for all: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a stage play, it was conceived and written as a stage play, it was always intended to be a stage play and nothing else, and there are absolutely no plans for it to become a movie, a novel, a puppet show, a cartoon, a comic book series or Cursed Child on Ice," read a statement on her official website jkrowling.com.
  
  Rowling also took to social media where in a series of tweets she disclosed:
  
  
  
  
  
  Harry Potter-series would mark 20 years of its popularity among book-lovers worldwide this year. The first book in the fantasy novel series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in June, 1997.
