 A good teacher is like a candle; it consumes itself to light the way for others’. Undoubtedly, among all professions across the globe, one of the hardest and noblest is that of teaching. To let educators take a break from their schedule,   in association with   and cosponsored by R K Tours & Travels organized the Times NIE Teachers’ Meet 2017-18 on January 19 at Adlabs Imagica, Khopoli.
 
 More than 400 teachers from schools across Mumbai participated in the enriching event, which provided a platform for them to interact with other educators. “We see a lot of schools visiting us, where kids enjoy while the teachers are busy managing them. It was a pleasant change to see them relax and enjoy themselves,” said Colonel Ashutosh Kale, joint CEO and executive director, Adlabs Entertainment Ltd.
 
 That day at the popular theme park among the usually over excited children, one saw these teachers mingling with other teachers from schools across the city. “I would like to thank Times NIE for this out-of-the-box initiative, which let us all come together, share ideas and experience the thrill of an amusement park together,” beamed Lidwina Mascarenhas, a teacher from St Joseph’s High School, Wadala. It helped them overcome their inner fears while interacting with one another. “Interestingly, I ended up spending time with teachers who once taught me in school. This forum is truly empowering,” shared Anjali Bhat, a teacher from Vishwajyot High School, Kharghar.
 
 Primarily, this initiative was a token of admiration, ensuring that educators don’t miss out on the simple pleasures of life. Mundayur Radhakrishnan, owner, RK Tours & Travels, stated, “I believe that Times NIE Teachers’ Meet is an amazing platform as it allows all the educators to come under one roof.” Various takeaways were given in the end, bringing down the curtains on what was an extremely adventurous day for the teachers.
