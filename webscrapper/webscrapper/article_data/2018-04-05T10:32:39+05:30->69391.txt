SATNA: A 16-year-old   walked into the SP’s office in   with a   in a bag, and a horror story to tell.

 A Class X student, she said was raped seven months ago at knife-point, and repeatedly after that, but local police paid no heed to her complaints. She realized she was pregnant only after she had stomach pain, but had no one to turn to. 
 
 On Wednesday, she was in agony and boarded an auto with her mother to go to hospital but were waylaid by her rapist and his aides, she told police. She and her mother were taken to a doctor’s house, where the foetus was aborted by force.
 
 “The doctor put the foetus in a bag and gave it to me, saying ‘throw it in a nullah’. Then, they gave me Rs 20 for auto fare and shooed me away,” she says in her complaint, adding that she was threatened with dire consequences if she told anybody about the abortion.
 
 Undaunted, she went to the SP’s office and filed a complaint, naming Neeraj Pandey. Satna SP Rajesh Hingarkar said, “I was not in office when the survivor came. But a case is being registered against the accused.”
