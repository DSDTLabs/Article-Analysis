MARGAO: With the   (MMC) claiming to have completed all its pre-monsoon works, the civic body can now breathe easy ahead of the monsoons. Significantly, this is the first time in recent years that the   has completed the pre-monsoon works much ahead of the monsoons.

 Speaking to TOI, MMC chief officer   said that as the municipality had commenced its pre-monsoon works much earlier this year, they could complete most of the works much ahead of time.
 
 “All the drains have been desilted. Only the major nullahs are left, and we have written to the water resources department (WRD) to clean them,”   said. As is the practice, the WRD floats tenders for desilting of the 10-12 big nullahs in the town.
 
 The MMC engaged its team of over 300 workers for the works, sources said.
 
 However, Savio Coutinho of the  , contested MMC’s claims that it has completed all pre-monsoon works.
