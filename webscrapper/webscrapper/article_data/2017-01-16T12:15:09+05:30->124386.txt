MARGAO:   on Sunday frowned upon individual church leaders openly canvassing for a party or candidate for the   scheduled for February 4.

 Speaking exclusively to TOI, Ferrao said, “The   (CSJP) will soon issue guidelines (to the faithful on how to exercise their franchise during the upcoming polls).”
 
 On whether priests could openly canvass for a party or candidate of their preference, Ferrao replied, “He cannot do so. If you are aware, please inform me.”
 
 It may be recalled that during the annual Christmas get-together held at the Archbishop Palace, Altinho Panaji on December 27, 2016, the archbishop had expressed his opinion on the ruling government with regards to ‘not being taken into confidence while framing the proposed draft education policy, the attacks on the community and the extensive environmental and social damage to Goa which has generated rampant corruption and even weakened governance’.
 
 Ferrao clarified that the Church guidelines on how to exercise your franchise during the polls do not mention the names of any party or candidate.
