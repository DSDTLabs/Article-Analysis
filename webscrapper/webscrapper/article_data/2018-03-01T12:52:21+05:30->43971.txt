BERHAMPUR: A junior clerk working in Gajapati's Mohana block was arrested for misappropriating around Rs16.61 lakh meant for execution of Prime Minister   (PMAY). Block development officer (BDO) Padmanav Behera lodged a police complaint against Rama Krushna Nayak. 

 An internal inquiry by the department revealed that Rs 12 lakh was bungled but police have put the amount at Rs 16.61 lakh. "We think the amount might have increased after a thorough inquiry," said IIC of Mohana police station P K Behera. 
 
 He said the amounts were transferred to different bank accounts of four persons, all friends of the accused at different times. The account holders are under police scenner and their role into the misappropriation of government funds will be inquired into, he said. Nayak was working in the block office for the last four years and started the illegal transfer of funds only last year, police sources said. 
 
 Before lodging a police complaint against Nayak, the district administration suspended him on February 15. Police claimed the accused has confessed to have misappropriated the funds. 
 
 Earlier, BDO (Baliguda) in   district lodged an FIR against 12 government officers, including five former BDOs, for irregularities in PMAY in K. Nuagaon block and suspended three officers. 
 
 The district administration has issued show cause notices to the accused to refund the funds over Rs 75 lakh within 15 days of receipt of notice. At least five officers have refunded the money so far, sources said. 
 
 "We are waiting for some more days for refund of the money from the accused officers," said a senior officer. While in Gajapati district, the fund was misappropriated directly, in Kandhamal the money was siphoned off through improper selection of beneficiaries, sources said.
