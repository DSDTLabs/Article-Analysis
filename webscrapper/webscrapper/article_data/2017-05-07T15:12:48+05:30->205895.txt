Unidentified persons threw acid on several cows, calves and a bull in  , Porbandar in the wee hours of Saturday. There was some tension as the news of the attack spread in the area, prompting the police to deploy staff as apreventive measure. Meanwhile, the injured bovine were taken to the local panjarapol for treatment. The police have registered a complaint against unidentified persons. The attack comes at a time when the state has tightened its cow slaughter laws.

 According to sources, some of the local residents found the injured bovines around 6am on Saturday.
 
 “The acid had burnt their hides and the animals were in a great deal of pain. The local residents and NGO activists rushed to the spot and called an animal helpline to treat the cows. After primary treatment, the animals were shifted to a local panjarapol,“ the police said.
 
 Raju Mer, a local resident of Bokhari, said, “I was shocked when I saw the animals with burnt hide. It is so inhuman, why would someone want to hurt these mute animals? We demand the arrest of those responsible immediately and strictest possible punishment should be given to them.“

Though the cows have suffered burns, they are all safe and recovering.“   added that no one has clai med ownership of the bovine. “The animals will stay at panjrapol till they are well or someone comes to claim them,“ he said.
 
 Last month, the Gujarat Animal Preservation (Amendment) Bill 2017, which makes many strict provisions including life imprisonment for killing cows got the governor's nod and became an Act.
