Bhopal: A team of Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), Lucknow, would be arriving here on Tuesday to collect water samples from 20 more settlements close to deserted Union Carbide plant, where groundwater has become toxic and not fit for consumption due to spread of chemical waste dumped on the Union Carbide premises and solar ponds where liquid chemical waste used to be transported from the plant and dumped. The Supreme Court in a recent interim order acknowledged that water in 20 more colonies have become affected due spread of chemical waste and asked the IITR to carry out sampling of groundwater in these areas. Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGAI), which is a party in the PIL filed before the apex court for provision of clean drinking water to people in several areas across the country where groundwater was contaminated and residents didn’t have access to piped water supply including areas around Union Carbide plant, said with the addition of 20 more colonies among water-contaminated areas, the total number of such colonies has gone up to 42. Residents in 22 colonies are already being provided piped water by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) following the apex court’s intervention.  Holding the state and Central governments responsible for spread in areas where groundwater is getting contaminated, convener of BGIA Satinath Sarangi said, “I don’t know whether the state and the Union governments are waiting for contamination to spread all over the city before they act to cleanse the source of contamination.” He recalled that when Supreme Court passed its first interim order, the number of affected colonies was only 14, which has trebled to 42 now. “Yet, the government is doing nothing to curb the spread of chemicals that damage the brain, lungs, kidneys and liver and cause cancer and birth defects”, Sarangi said, while addressing a press conference on Monday.  BGIA co-convener Rachna Dhingra said “The groundwater contamination began with the unsafe burial of hazardous waste by the Union Carbide management. The government of India holds Dow Chemical legally liable for this second environmental disaster in Bhopal but in practice is doing everything possible to let the corporation get away without cleaning up the contaminated area as per the terms of the land lease.”
