Coimbatore: The   intends to attract more students from Tamil Nadu to apply for the   and at the same time explore business interests among local entrepreneurs to invest in the United Kingdom, deputy high commissioner Bharath Joshi, who is visiting educational institutions to reach out to students, said here on Friday.

 Speaking to reporters at the Coimbatore Golf Club in Chettipalayam, Joshi said, “Only 5% of the total applicants for the Chevening Scholarship are from Tamil Nadu. Last year, we had a total of five students selected for the scholarship out of about 100 applicants. This year, we have about 165 seats for the scholarship.”
 
 Asked about the reasons behind poor application rate from Tamil Nadu, Joshi said, “Given the quality of the students in the state, we should be receiving many applications. But, I think the fact that Chevening is for candidates, who intend to study and return to India, and that it demands a minimum of two years’ experience is a reason.” 
 
 Joshi plans to meet students at eight educational institutions. “I will be meeting students in Coimbatore and Ooty (Udhagamandalam). We wish to see more students from this area taking up the Chevening Scholarship,” he said.
 
 The deputy high commissioner also spoke about the United Kingdom’s plans to promote business interests among entrepreneurs. “We are looking at business interests in textiles, automobiles, automation and many other fields,” said Joshi.
 
 He also spoke about UK’s interest in sharing expertise to Coimbatore for the smart city project. “We have helped Kochi with water by providing experts from the UK. We are interested in sharing such expertise with Coimbatore too,” he said.
 
 Joshi said the number of Indian students travelling to the UK for higher education has slightly dipped from 18,000 last year. “But, the dip is because we only get genuine and better quality candidates,” he said.
