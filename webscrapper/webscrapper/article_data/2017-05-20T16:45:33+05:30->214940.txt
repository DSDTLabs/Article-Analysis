Bengaluru: To rectify incorrect land measurement records in the property tax system, the   will re-survey approximately 51  , 77 technology parks and thousands of major industrial units and apartment complexes. The exercise will begin from next week. 

 Palike officials will visit pre-identified properties to conduct the total station survey (TSS) against the measurements provided by property owners themselves under the Self-Assessment Scheme (SAS).
 
 MK Gunashekar, chairman of the standing committee on taxation and finance, had earlier said the panel is empowered under Section 110 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act 1976 to re-measure properties. As Till now, BBMP had identified 10 buildings whose owners paid lesser property tax and declared less than the actual built-up area, and recovered Rs 232 crore from them.
 
 “Work orders have been issued and we will re-audit the establishments from next week. We have already identified certain malls, tech parks and other large properties and our officials will visit various spots to conduct the exercise. We had announced in this year’s budget that tax defaulters will be brought to book and dues will be recovered,” he said.
 
 According to taxation and finance officials, the first phase will cover only malls and tech parks; identification and re-measuring of industries and apartment complexes will be done in subsequent phases. Considering that most industries don’t have multiple floors, BBMP has decided to undertake their re-measurement on its own manually, said Lakshmegowda, special officer to the taxation and finance chairman.
 
 “We hope to start with approximately 15 of the largest properties in the city. Based on survey results, we will add more properties to the list over the next three months,” he said, adding they are hoping to rack up Rs 300-500 crore in the form of tax. “The figure will become clearer once we start the work,” he said.

 Pay tax at stalls in 9 locations 
 
 To ease the process of property tax payment, BBMP has collaborated with Canara Bank to set up stalls at nine assistant revenue offices (AROs) which will accept property tax payments in cash up to Rs 25,000. This is being done mainly for the benefit of senior citizens and those from low-income households to avoid the hassle of standing in lines to get khata.
 
 “Now, people can pay at these counters and immediately get a receipt. They can identify the centre closest to their house and avail the service,” said MK Gunashekar. The service is available from May 19 at AROs in Jayanagar, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Dasarahalli, Mayo Hall, CV Raman Nagar, Bommanahalli, Hoodi, Marathahalli/Whitefield and Galianjaneyaswamy Temple.
