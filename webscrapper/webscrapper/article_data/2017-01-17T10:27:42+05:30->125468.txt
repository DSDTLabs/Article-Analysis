HYDERABAD: Suspended and jailed, for lending his support to the students' movement last year, assistant professor   from the department of mathematics said on Monday that the university has undergone a sea change over the last year. Sadly, not for the better, according to him.

 Sengupta, along with his colleague   (associate professor from the political science department), was arrested on March 22, 2016, on  .A group of 25 students were also arrested along with them. The professors were subsequently suspended by the UoH administration.
 
 “We were suspended for three months though the university claimed it had revoked the suspension much earlier. Despite conducting classes during that period, we were not paid our salaries,“ the as sistant professor said while lashing out at the Centre for distancing itself from the   and “openly backing“ vice-chancellor Appa Rao Podile by honouring him at the Indian Science Congress recently held at Tirupati.
 
 Speaking about the college administration's attitude towards students from economically backward and marginalized sections on campus, he said, “they are increasingly being targeted. Though the administration is aware of their poor financial situation and the fact that they are not receiving their fellowship funds, it is still pressuring them to clear mess and hostel dues.“
 
 Other issues plaguing the university , according to Sengupta, include a visible increase in “moral policing“ and “irregularities in faculty recruitments“. Instead of deserving candidates, people who are close to the administration are given prominent positions and promotions, he alleged. While the professor will be away in Mumbai, on academic work on Tuesday , he assured support for planned protests. “I express my complete solidarity will Dalit students here. I am sure that there will be some programme relating to Rohith's death anniversary in Mumbai as well and I will attend it,“ he said.
