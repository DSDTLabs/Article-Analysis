NAGPUR: The MIDC police on Monday night arrested two persons, including an HSC student, for   extracted from cobra and  

 Acting on a tip-off that some persons travelling in an Innova were planning to strike a deal for venom, police laid a trap in MIDC area and caught the accused.
 
 The two arrested have been identified as Gopal Singh Rainsingh Gaur (35), a resident of Swastik Apartment, Hudkeshwar, and   (18), a student, who hails from Talodi (Chandrapur), but studies in the city and stays with his sister-in-law.
 
 During a search of the vehicle, police found five test-tubes with 25ml venom. As the offence pertained to the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, the case was handed over to Hingna range forest officer (RFO) CH Patil on Tuesday morning.
 
 Patil said the kingpin Gopal Singh is giving conflicting statements. He told police officials that the venom was stolen by him from Saoner, when a deal was being made by some parties. He contradicted himself before forest officials by saying the venom was with him for five months and he was planning to sell it. However, the medical representative with whom Singh was negotiating a deal for Rs1 lakh turned out to be a decoy and landed him behind bars.
 
 The second accused, Amrutkar, is a HSC student and was to appear for his electronics paper on Wednesday. He told foresters that he was just accompanying Singh, who was a family friend, and did not know Singh was to strike a deal for venom.
 
 Both the accused were produced before Hingna   first class (JMFC) PP Deshmukh, who remanded both to forest custody remand (FCR) till March 24.
