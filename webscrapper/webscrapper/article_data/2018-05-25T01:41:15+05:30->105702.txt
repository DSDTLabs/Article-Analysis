Mumbai: A   has dragged the daughter of actors Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh,   Sultan, to court over a dispute in dates. A vacation bench of Justice S J Kathawalla heard the producer’s counsel, Sharan Jagtiani, who pleaded urgency. The court posted the matter for a hearing on Friday. 

 The producer has also made Sultan’s agent and a talent management company party in the suit to restrain her from working for another film, ‘Simba’, as he claimed that she had already committed dates to her debut film, ‘Kedarnath’. The complainant also wants the HC to direct her to complete her initial commitment first and demanded Rs 5 crore as damages. The question being raised in court is whether an actor can change dates already given and give them for another movie.
 
  In his complaint, the producer said in 2017, they undertook production of the film, tentatively named “Kedarnath’, to be directed by Abhishek Kapoor with Sushant Singh as the male lead. The complaint said Sultan signed an agreement to be the female lead last September. The plea in court is that though Sultan had agreed to be available for the shoot, when informed in May that the shoot would continue till July 5, her agent said she would not be available in June since she has to shoot for another film, which, according to the petitioner, is a “breach” of the agreement. tnn
