NEW DELHI: As couples ambled into   on Valentine’s Day for a romantic interlude, they came across another pair at the park entrance. The two weren’t gazing into each other’s eyes, but selling fruits. Harsh Yadav and Megha Mittal, students of  , thought February 14 would be a great way to jointly fulfil each other’s wishes.

 “We recently did a story on street hawkers for a college project and we wondered what their lives on the street would be like. So, we decided to set up a stall and sell something too,” said Mittal. A happy Yadav said, “This venture has been fruitful and we have already earned around Rs 200 in three hours.”
 
 Rooplal Prajapati, an ice-cream vendor at the garden since 1978, was impressed. “They showed the younger generation wants to do more than just spend time together on Valentine’s Day. They want to tell people about our lives.”
