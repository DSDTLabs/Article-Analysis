Television actors   and   were arrested on Wednesday by the Mumbai forest officials for posting photographs with a cobra on social media in October. 
Santosh  , range forest officer, Mumbai division, said, “The actors committed the violation under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, by posing with the snake, which comes under the protected category. We had taken them in judicial custody on Wednesday. It is a serious offence and they should be aware of the rules. We are taking them to the   police station from  .” 
 However, Shruti denied being in judicial custody. “This was something that happened two-and-a-half months back. A snake-catcher had visited our set in Film City during the 100-day celebration of the show, Nagarjun-Ek Yoddha. Since it was a real cobra, my adventurous streak pushed me to pose for pictures. Later, I uploaded those pictures on my social media account, completely unaware that it is a crime. The officials contacted us on Wednesday, and we co-operated with them.” 
 Pearl also denied that he was under judicial custody. He said, “We are definitely not arrested. Otherwise, how would I be talking right now? The forest officials called us to their office only to recognise the snake-catcher as he has committed a serious offence. We are not at fault here. I didn’t know that posing with a snake is a crime.”
 Interestingly, Kank disagreed. “If they are saying that they were not arrested or taken under judicial custody, they are lying. We will need to take details of how they caught hold of the cobra and posed for pictures with it,” the forest official said.
