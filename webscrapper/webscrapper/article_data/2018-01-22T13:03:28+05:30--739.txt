MYSURU: In a bid to ensure that all exhibits at the   in the city remain in a perfect condition, and that the toy train also gets a break,   have decided to shut operations at the museum every Wednesday starting January 24.

 The Rail Museum was set up in 1979 under the supervision of the Indian railways. Located opposite to the CSIR-Central Food technological Research institute campus in the city, the museum was the second-of-its-kind in the country. One of the distinctive features of the museum is that it is the only one to house exhibits of vintage locomotives outdoors. The museum boasts an extensive collection of ancient steam locomotives and carriages, with more than 8,000 people visiting it monthly.
 
 One of the prize possessions of the museum is the royal carriage that once belonged to the erstwhile Mysuru rulers. Visitors can also get a peek into two   that were once used by the Mysuru maharajas. One of the carriages, which dates back to 1899, has a kitchem , a dining unit and a lavatory, The other exhibits at the museum include ancient railway equipment such as signalling lights, clocks, and even a ceiling fan.
 
 In a bid to enhance its popularity, railway authorities have proposed renovation of the museum, and have sought ideas from the district administration for the same.
