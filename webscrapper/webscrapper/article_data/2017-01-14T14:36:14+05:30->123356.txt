Actors   and   may not be a couple any more but the ' ' star says there is 'so much love between them'. 

  
  
 Garfield, 33, who parted ways with the 'La La Land' actress last year in October after four years together, revealed that they still care about each other a lot. "There's so much love between us and so much respect... It's also been wonderful to have that kind of support for each other. It's nothing but a beautiful thing. 
 
 "We care about each other so much, and that's a given, that's kind of this unconditional thing," Garfield said. Garfield, who gave his former girlfriend a standing ovation as she picked up a   for the best actress- musical, said it is a pleasure to see Stone doing so well in her career. 
 
 "I'm her biggest fan as an artist. I'm constantly inspired by her work. I'm constantly inspired by how she handles and holds herself. "So, for me it's been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress she is."
