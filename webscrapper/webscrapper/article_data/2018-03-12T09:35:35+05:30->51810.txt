COIMBATORE/SALEM: Hitting out at actor  , CM   said there was no political vacuum in Tamil Nadu after the demise of J  .

 The people of TN had filled the vacuum created by the death of Jayalalithaa by extending their support to   government, he said. Addressing a meeting in his hometown Edappadi near Salem on Sunday to commemorate MGR’s birth anniversary, EPS hit out at Haasan, accusing him of not remunerating co-actor Gautami. “Till Kamal was acting in movies, he was not at all concerned about the welfare of TN. 
 
 How can he provide welfare for the people when he is not even giving remuneration to Gautami who acted in his movies?’’ EPS asked.
 
 Recalling Kamal’s statement that he would leave the country during the Viswaroopam row, EPS asked how can a person who wanted to flee the country save the TN people.
