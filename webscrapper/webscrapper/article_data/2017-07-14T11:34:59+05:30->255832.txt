AHMEDABAD: The Union minister of   and empowerment, Thawar Chand Gehlot, said there will be zero tolerance for those taking the law into their own hands. Union minister of state   said the self-styled gau rakshaks are actually ‘narbhaksh’ (maneaters) .

 The two were in Ahmedabad for the regional conference of the ministers of social welfare departments from Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra,  , Rajasthan and the Union terrorities of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.
 
  Gehlot, in reply to a question about the targeting and lynchings of minorities and dalits in the name of cow protection, said, “The party and the government are clear that no one will be spared. All those taking the law into their own hands in the name of cow protection will not be spared.”
 
 About the Una incident, Gehlot had praised the Gujarat government and said that justice would be done to all the victims, including those of the Una flogging incident. He said that the Gujarat government was quick to take action after the incident. Athawale said, “The governments in the country, including BJP governments, are taking action against those involved in attacking people in the name of beef or cow protection. 
 
 They are not cow protectors but narbhaksh (maneaters). There have been attacks on dalits in the past as well. Inter-caste marriages should be encouraged to bring these under control. We in the ministry are also working to encourage inter-caste marriage,” Athawale said. He said they were dealing with the so-called cow protectors, but the Congress was blaming the BJP for such attacks instead. “One needs to investigate whether those involved are from the BJP or Congress,” he added
 
 Athawale also supported   supremo Uddhav Thackeray’s statement that those involved in cow protection should go on the borders and fight terrorists.
