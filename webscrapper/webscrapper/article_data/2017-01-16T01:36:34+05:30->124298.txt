NOIDA: The traffic police is pulling out all stops to avoid major congestions on Mahamaya-Kalindi Kunj route from Monday as almost half of the road has been blocked for construction of an underpass which will connect sectors 94 and 95 to the Master Plan Road-III in Noida.

 Though diversions have been in place for the past three days, the traffic police has decided to increase the strength of its personnel at the spot where the underpass is being built. 
 
 SP (traffic) Prabal Pratap Singh told TOI that two head constables and two constables will be deployed on the stretch to monitor incoming traffic.
 
 An area of nearly 250 metres has been blocked on the   carriageway of the six-lane road near the upcoming   station in Sector 94 for the construction. The police had already urged heavy vehicle owners to avoid the Mahamaya flyover to   route owing to the construction undertaken by  .
 
 According to traffic police, increased cooperation with the Delhi traffic police is required to ensure that the three lanes from Noida to Delhi do not get crowded due to the blockage. 
 
 A traffic sub-inspector has been sent to request the Delhi traffic police to increase the duration of the red light at the   barrage chowki which falls in Delhi area, said an officer. 
 
 The underpass, which will join sectors 94, 95, 125, etc with the Master Plan III road, aims to decongest the stretch between Kalindi Kunj in Delhi and NH-24 signal-free. 
 
 The Rs 40-crore project has been delayed by almost one-and-a-half years due to a stay on construction from the Allahabad high court. The construction has been re-started after the Noida Authority got the stay vacated recently.
 
 A curved road has been created at the left side of the stretch for commuters going from Noida to Delhi via the route. This curve will be used for at least six-seven months till the work of the underpass gets completed.
