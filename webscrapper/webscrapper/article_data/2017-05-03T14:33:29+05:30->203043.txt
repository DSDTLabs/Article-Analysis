 If figures provided by the  , Hyderabad, and   are anything to go by, the  , priced over Rs 40 lakh, has hit the fast lane, racing to a three-year high during the 2016-17 financial year.
 
 The sales of   in the city has already shot up to 250-270 per month (around 3,000-3,300 for the year) in 2016-17, registering a 15% jump over 2015-16, RTA officials said, adding that of these, at least 200 were sold in the ultra-luxury segment in the Rs 1crore to Rs 6 crore bracket. Industry sources say that the Hyderabad market for luxury cars is growing at a faster clip than Bengaluru and Chennai going by the number of cars whizzing out of car showrooms and if things move at this pace, Hyderabad may well race past Bengaluru, which currently stands third in buying luxury cars after Mumbai and Delhi.
 
 "Apart from Tollywood stars, producers, directors and scriptwriters, pharma barons and promoters of infrastructure giants are the main buyers of ultra-luxury cars, nearly 20 of which are being sold each month," said J Pandurang Na ik, Joint Transport Commissioner, Hyderabad.
 
 Car dealers point out that cars in the Rs 40 lakh to Rs 70 lakh price range are the fastest moving in the luxury segment with buyers hailing from various age groups. â€œStarting from 25-year-olds, which includes young, upwardly mobile techies and promoters of startups, to those in the 50-55 age bracket are queuing up to buy their dream cars. The easy availability of finance has only accelerated this trend over the past three years," said the marketing manager of a luxury car dealership.
 
 Another reason for the jump in sales could be the fact that most of the buyers of luxury cars like to upgrade every three years on an average, industry sources said.
