NEW DELHI: The proposed high-profile review of the   (FDI) by prime minster   on Friday was deferred to a later date as finance minister   was not available.
 
  Jaitely, who is also the defence minister, had to attend the all-party meet on China. The meeting will now be held at a later date.
  
  Government is considering further liberalising the   to ease overseas investment in retail sector. Proposal to allow 100% FDI for retailing of India manufactured goods is being discussed along with the proposal of opening up sale of personal goods by food retailers up to 25%.
  
  In order to further ease processes government is also mulling to bring the single brand retail under the approval route. There are about five applications now pending with the DIPP for FDI in single brand retail.
  
  Overall, there are 70 FDI applications pending with the government after the abolition of the foreign investment promotion board. The DIPP is now the nodal ministry for ensuring FDI applications are cleared by the concerned ministries within strict timelines. The department will also be holding joint quarterly review meetings to take stock of the pendency of FDI applications.
  
  India recorded the highest ever foreign direct investment in 2016-17 at $43 billion â€” up 9% over last year. Last year, the government relaxed FDI rules in defence, civil aviation, construction and development and real estate, among others. Food retail was also opened up for foreign investors as long as products sold were manufactured and processed entirely in India.
  
  DIPP last week cleared the application of Amazon to enter the food retail segment in India making the US-b based ecommerce giant the first foreign entity to enter the sector since it was liberalised.
