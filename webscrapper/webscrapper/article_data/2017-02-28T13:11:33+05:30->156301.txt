CALANGUTE: Speaking at the   last Sunday,   said the panchayat has decided to build a roundabout around a traffic island, which has an electricity transformer, telephone switch box and a  .

 The road junction, on the Calangute-Arpora road, just after the Calangute market junction, was widened during the road-widening exercise undertaken by Calangute MLA Michael Lobo.
 
 Initially, during the road widening, it had been decided to shift the transformer, telephone switch box and the water pipeline valve to a suitable spot by the side of the widened road. But it could not be done as multiple agencies were involved and the matter had continued to linger on.
 
 Sequeira has now disclosed that the road would be further widened and the impromptu traffic island would be converted into a small roundabout. “It is impossible to do anything about shifting the transformer, telephone box and the water valve because a lot of things like cables and pipes would also have to be shifted, which would affect a large number of people. So we have decided to retain the spot as it is and convert it into a permanent traffic island,” he said.
