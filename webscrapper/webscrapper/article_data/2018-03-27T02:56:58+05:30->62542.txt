NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish   on Monday said that Delhi government would complete studying the proposed six corridors of Delhi Metroâ€™s Phase-IV project to find out which routes are viable and which are not.

 Sisodia told reporters that the routes are being studied by finance secretary S N Sahai, who would submit a report soon. He said that approving unviable routes would impact the fare structure of the proposed lines.
 
 During the inauguration of the Majlis Park-Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus section of Pink Line recently, CM Arvind Kejriwal had said that his government is soon going to approve all viable routes of Phase-IV project.
 
 The Aam Aadmi Party government had given its in-principle approval to the Phase IV project in January 2016, but is yet to give its formal approval and financial commitment for the project.
 
 The Phase IV of Delhi   has a total length of 104 kms and will cost Rs. 55,208 crore.
