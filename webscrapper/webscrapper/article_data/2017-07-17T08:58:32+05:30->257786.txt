MUMBAI:   of Sai Hall area in Bhandup (west) deliberately cut the tip of the tail of a   which was spotted in the locality on Saturday. When volunteers of Plant and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS-Mumbai) rushed to the spot, the locals told them that they did so as the tails of such species are `deadly' and fatal for humans.
 
  
 "Our volunteer Tanmay Kolte had got a call from Sai Hall that a foot-long monitor lizard has been spotted near a house. However, when we reached there, it was shocking to see that someone had cut off a tiny part from the tail end of the lizard, as the locals were under the impression that if the tail tip of a monitor lizard touches a human, it can be fatal as it is 'poisonous'. Fortunately, the rescued lizard is now responding well to treatment,'' said Sunish Subramanian of PAWS-Mumbai.
 
 The activists immediately reprimanded the locals and clarified to them that monitor lizard are quite harmless and that their tails are not at all deadly.
 
 Four kinds of Monitor Lizards are found in India and all of them are Schedule 1 protected species under Indiaâ€™s Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
 
 Subramanian further stated that the monitor lizard will be left in a forested region after its injured tail heals in a few days. "Through various media, we are also spreading awareness about reptiles such as snakes, since many people have several misconceptions about them as well,'' he said.
 
 PAWS-Mumbai along with the forest officials also rescued a malnourished monkey that was held captive in a slum at Ghatkopar (east) recently. It will be sent to a rehabilitation centre soon.
 
  
  
 If citizen come across such animal related incidents, they can report to PAWS-Mumbai Helpline 9833480388 or the Forest Department.
