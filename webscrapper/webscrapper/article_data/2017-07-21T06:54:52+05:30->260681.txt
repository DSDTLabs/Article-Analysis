NEW DELHI: There can be no justification for violence in the name of cow protection, but references to the need to protect bovines were included in the Constitution by stalwarts who did not hail from saffron backgrounds, FM   told the   on Thursday.

 Jaitley said the Constitution gives equal rights to all to practice their faith.“The government’s stand is clear. Nobody is allowed to do that ( ...in the name of cow protection). No argument of sentiments being hurt can be an explanation for this,” he said. 
 
 But he also sought to remind the opposition that it was the Constitution drafting committee, chaired by B R Ambedkar, that recommended cow protection.
 
 Replying to a two-day debate on lynchings and atrocities against Dalits and minorities, he said there was a majority section in India that supports cow protection.
 
 “The Constituent assembly debated the issue in detail... Article 48 (to prevent cow slaughter) was drafted by Ambedkar... it was not proposed by Narendra Modi or  ,” he said. Earlier, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar cited the Godhra train carnage, where 59 people were burnt alive, saying, “These were also lynchings.” This led an uproar from the opposition.
 
 The Leader of the House rejected the idea of a separate law against mob lynchings.
