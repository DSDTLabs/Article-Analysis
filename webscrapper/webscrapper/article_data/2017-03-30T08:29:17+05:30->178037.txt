KOCHI: An   who has been offering spoken English online course school through Skype to the students of upper primary classes at   visited them on Wednesday. 

  has been conducting online classes for the students of Classes V to VII for the past three months since January 2017. Immediately after the school got a smart classroom from MLA Hibi Eden's fund in November, the school headmistress contacted Hanson online and requested her if she could take spoken English classes for the 35 students in the school. Hanson agreed and so far she has conducted 30 classes.
 
 Interacting with the students for almost two hours, she spoke about the countries she had visited, the people she met and their cultures. "Hanson advised students not to restrict themselves and they should access all avenues to acquire knowledge," said  , headmistress, SRV School.
 
 Hanson then told the students that she had come after visiting her students in Kenya and she was eager to meet them. This made the students smile and they wanted to know more about the places she visited. The children had met their tutor online and shared with her in their broken English about the US and its culture. 
 
 "The students come from poor families and were anxious and excited to learn English from a foreigner. The interactions have helped the students and they are keen to speak in English," said Ambika.
 
 To ensure that students don't miss out on the spoken English class, they had adjusted the spoken English classes within the school timings. 
 
 "If we had arranged classes after regular hours, the students would have got a chance to interact with foreign students of their age. But that was not possible and we had to arrange the classes during the school hours," the headmistress said.
