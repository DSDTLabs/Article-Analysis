MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday questioned whether it was appropriate for calls to be made from a minister’s office to a court receiver appointed to take possession of  , Navi Mumbai.

 A division bench of Justices   and   said, “Somebody sitting in Mantralaya should not do this. We can understand may be a local representative who has a flat in the building, but is it appropriate for some one sitting in Mantralaya?” 
 
 The court receiver in his report informed the HC that when they had gone to take possession of one of the buildings, a local said that he had received a call from the personal assistant of the guardian minister seeking to talk to the officer. Calls were also made to the court receiver’s office, the court was told. Advocate general Rohit Deo assured the court an inquiry into the issue.
 
 The court was hearing a PIL about illegal buildings in Navi Mumbai. The state submitted a fresh draft policy that will protect illegal buildings across Maharashtra constructed prior to December 31, 2015 and pave the way for their regularisation as per rules. 
 
 The court, however, pointed out that various provisions in the draft policy that could give a back-door entry to  . “You are creating lots of loopholes for people to litigate,” remarked the judges. “While one clause says illegal buildings on prohibited land or public plots will not be regularised, another allows it if a no-objection certificate is granted by the planning authority. By virtue of some of the provisions commercial structures and even an industrial structure can be regularised in a residential zone. This can have disastrous consequences,” the judges added. The high court will continue to hear the case on Wednesday.
