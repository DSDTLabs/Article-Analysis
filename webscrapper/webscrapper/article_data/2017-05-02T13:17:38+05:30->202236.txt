An angry   asks   why did she create a drama? Bani tells her that she wanted to break Samar and Tina’s wedding. Bani says she has been doing this so that she wanted to hurt Thapki.
 
  Bani tells her that she hates Thapki and has always hated her eversince she had done her kanyadaan when she was young.
  
  Thapki recalls the moment when many years ago Shraddha had conspired against her and wore her face mask to hurt her family. But Bani refuses to believe her mother Thapki and says now she will do everything to destroy her mother's life.
  
  An angry Bani leaves the temple and Thapki recalls Bani’s words and is heartbroken.
  
  Bani reaches her home and cries. Kosi asks her about it and this is when Kosi tells her that she has told the truth to Thapki.
  
  Kosi says she has ruined everything. Bani tells her that Thapki had come to know about the party conspiracy so she has ruined everything.
  
  Kosi thinks Bani will get them thrown out of the house.
  
  Bani is called outside and they see Tina, Munna, Balwinder and Vasu standing.
  
  
 
  
  Vasu says Thapki has told them everything. Tina covers Bani's head with dupatta and says you are going to be a bride soon. Vasu tells her that she will be marrying Munna soon.
  
  Bani shouts at her mother Thapki and tells her that she has no right to think about her life.
  
  Thapki asks Bani to believe her and that whatever she is doing is for Bani's well being. Bani asks her mother to return her 15 years and asks her to bring back her father Bihaan. Thapki is shocked.
