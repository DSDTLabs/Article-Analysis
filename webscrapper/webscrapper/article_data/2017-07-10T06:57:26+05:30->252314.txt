CHENNAI: The Kilpauk police on Sunday arrested a 22-year-old man for raping a woman he had befriended and using sexually explicit video to blackmail her.

 Officers of the Kilpauk all-women police station arrested M Deepak alias  , of TP Chatram, on a complaint from the woman, also 22, and an   student in the city.
 
 An investigating officer said Deepak, an aspiring athlete, met the woman through her father, a physical trainer. The pair soon established a relationship and decided to get married.
 
 “Deepak took the woman around the city to visit various places and, on one occasion, later took her to his house,” the officer said. “The woman said he raped her there.”
 
 “We suspect that he served her cool drinks spiked with drugs and, when she lost consciousness, raped her repeatedly,” he said. “He also filmed the act with his cellphone.”
 
 The pair soon broke up because Deepak suspected that the woman was friendly with another man. But he was reluctant to let go nonetheless and wanted them to give their relationship another chance.
 
 “The woman’s father, meanwhile, was looking for a bridegroom for his daughter so she asked Deepak to stay away from her,” the officer said. “Deepak was enraged over this. He started to threaten her with the compromising video to force her to continue their relationship.”
 
 When his threats appeared to have no effect, Deepak obtained the cellphone number of her fiancé and sent a copy of the video to the man. This caused the would-be groom and his family to call off the wedding.
 
 “The woman was depressed and confided in her father, telling him what Deepak had done,” the officer said. “The family decided that the woman should lodge a police complaint against Deepak.
 
 Police arrested Deepak and booked him under IPC Section 376 (punishment for  ) and under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form).
