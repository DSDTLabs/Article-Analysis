It came as a surprise to many when pictures of Diamond Necklace fame actress Gauthami Nair’s wedding with filmmaker Srinath Rajendran, flooded the internet.

 Excited movie lovers are curious about the couple’s relationship, but Gauthami reveals to us that theirs was no 'filmy' affair. She adds, “We have been really close friends right from our first film Second Show. We never planned anything and there was nothing like ‘down on the knee’ proposal. We have been buddies for a long time, and share a great rapport with each other. One day during a conversation, we casually talked about sharing a life together.” Well, what could be more beautiful than having your best friend for a life partner? she asks.
 
 The couple got married in a traditional ceremony at a resort in Muhamma, Alappuzha on April 2. About the function, she says, “The guest list included only family and close friends, as we did not want to go overboard with the decorations and ceremonies. It was as simple as it could be.”
 
 And when two people of the Second Show team were getting united, how could   and  , who marked their Mollywood entry through the film, not be part of it? Gauthami says,” For me, my friends are my family, and they always knew about us. While Sunny was at the wedding venue throughout the day, Dulquer had to leave because of prior commitments.” Actor Suresh Gopi was also invited for the function.
 
 Gauthami, who is pursuing her Masters in Psychology, says that studies will always come first, and it would not take a backseat, now that she is married. She says, “I have no definite plans about films or studies and am just living in the present now. I am going with the flow.” Post marriage, she will continue her studies in Trivandrum, while Srinath will be working on his upcoming film project with Sunny Wayne.
