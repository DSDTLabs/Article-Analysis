NEW DELHI:Though among the earlier recruits of Indian Mujahideen, Abdul Subhan   or Tauqeer chose to stay in the background, playing the role of motivator and recruiter for the outfit by leading ideological indoctrination relating to jihad and firearms training at secret camps.

 Tauqeer, who like other ‘leading lights’ of IM had a SIMI link, was an expert bomb maker and motivator for disgruntled youngsters who joined the group between 2007 and 2013 and felt that Muslims should take up arms to “liberate India” and “restore” an Islamic society.
 
 He designed the outfit’s strategy of signing and sending emails in the name of ‘Al-Arbi’ owning responsibility for the bombs in considerable detail with references to regaining lost Muslim lands and “battles” such as Hyderabad, where the Nizam was displaced post-Partition, which gave security agencies their first clues of a connection with LeT and  .
 
 Officers who chased him for years said Qureshi didn’t leave a trail of his presence in the city where blasts happened. He was in Delhi in September 2008 conducting reconnaissance of targets along with Atif Ameen and others but vanished into thin air hours before the bombs went off. The Atif module was busted with the encounter claiming the life of Delhi Police officer  .
 
 “He remained underground for most of the time between 2007 and 2013, when Indian Mujahideen carried out 30 bomb blasts killing over 200 people. But it doesn’t mean that he wasn’t active,” said an officer who worked on IM for years, adding that “he used his skills to radicalize youth, arrange money and train the bombers”.
 
 The officer said that leaders of various IM modules – like Atif Ameen, Tehsin Monu and even its India head   remained the known faces of the outfit for years, but it was Qureshi who was a key planner.
