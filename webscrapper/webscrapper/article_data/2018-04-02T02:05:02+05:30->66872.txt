NEW DELHI: Deposing before a court, which is hearing the trial of journalist   murder, the doctor who had conducted her   said that the container, having the bullet that killed her, was in an “unsealed” condition as its “lid was lying open”.

 Dr Manish Kumath, a prosecution witness in the case, said that though he could identify the box containing the bullet, he could not identify the bullet itself.
 
 “From the said envelope, one glass transparent container containing a bullet was taken out. The said glass container was, however, unsealed as its lid was lying open. I can identify the box, which was handed over to the IO with the bullet, but not the bullet (sic),” Dr Kamath said in a statement during his examination.
 
 Since the doctors only took out the bullet from the body and put it in the container, they could identify the box that was handed over to the IO with the bullet, but not the bullet itself.
 
 Dr Kumath, a senior resident at the department of forensic medicine at AIIMS at that time, had on September 30, 2008, conducted Vishwanathan’s autopsy with Dr Sanjeev Lalwani.
 
 His statement before additional sessions judge Sunena Sharma also showed that a bullet was found lodged near the left side of fractured occipto-temporal bone of the skull. “The wound tract in brain matter was filled with blood and small pieces of bones. The brain shows sub-dural haemetoma in parieto-temporal and occipital region,” Dr Kumath stated in court.
 
 Vishwanathan (25) was found dead in her car in Vasant Kunj around 3.30am on September 30, 2008. She was shot in the back of her head. The accused in Soumya’s case are Ravi Kapoor, Baljeet Singh Malik, Amit Shukla, Ajay Kumar and Ajay Sethi. 
 
 Kapoor, Shukla and Malik were earlier convicted and sentenced in the 2009 murder case of IT executive Jigisha Gosh. While Kapoor and Shukla were given death penalty, Malik was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in August 2016.
