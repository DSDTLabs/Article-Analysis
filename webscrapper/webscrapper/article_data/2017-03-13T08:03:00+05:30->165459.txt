NEW DELHI: They were to get married within the next two months, but the houses of these four cousins were reduced to ashes right before their eyes. The joyous occasion of matrimonial bliss seems to have eluded 15 more   in the locality as even their weddings had been fixed in May. The grieving family members are now doubtful if they be able to marry off their daughters.

 “Since the past few months, we had been visiting shops buying things and preparing for the weddings of our daughters. But we had never thought that we would see such a day when everything we had collected would be burnt down. I can’t control my tears when I see my daughter standing and gazing at our collapsed house,” said Mumtaz.
 
 The families don’t think that they will be able to manage the costs of the weddings. “I had passed out of school last year and was supposed to get married. But even my   dress and the invitation cards have been reduced to a crisp,” said Sano.
 
 There were several others who were left wondering about their future. 
 
 “The fire spread swiftly and there was no way that I could have picked up my things, including my school documents. I ran for my life when I saw a fireball emerge behind me,” said Kaniz Bano.
 
 While some were grieving, there were others who sifted through the ashes trying to find their valuables. “I had recently bought a gold jewellery set for my daughter’s marriage and had kept it in this cupboard. I can’t afford to get it made again,” said Salman, who had managed to find a gold bangle amidst the ashes.
