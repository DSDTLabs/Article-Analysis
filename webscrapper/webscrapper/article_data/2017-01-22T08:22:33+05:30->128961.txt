AHMEDABAD: With the   for 2017-18 to be presented on February 1, the   ( ) has made suggestions regarding General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR), Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and increasing threshold  . These suggestions have been made in a memorandum submitted to the state government. 

 The state's apex industry body has urged the government to defer GAAR provisions that are to be applicable from the financial year 2017-18. GCCI's argument is that no guidelines for implementatiion of GAAR provisions have been laid down so far. It has also requested the government to issue guidelines at the earliest to bring clarity to industry.
 
 Apart from increasing tax exemption limits for transport and children' education allowances, the association has also asked the government to raise the limit under Section 80C of   to at least Rs 3 lakh from current the Rs 1.5 lakh. This would provide an impetus to insurance and other investments leading to more capital formation in the economy, the association has said.
 
 "It is suggested that the deduction of interest on housing loan may be increased from current Rs 2 lakh to Rs 4 lakh," GCCI has suggested in its memorandum.
 
 Other prominent demands of the GCCI include revision of the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) limit, re-introduction of standard deduction for salaried person, and abolition of alternate minimum tax (AMT) for units in the special economic zones (SEZs) as envisaged in the SEZ Act. In order to reduce compliance burden on the individual and the HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) taxpayers, GCCI has suggested that such taxpayers should be kept out of the purview of provisions of AMT.
 
 "With a view to accelerate the growth in infrastructure- this is very vital for the economic development of the country - the bonds issued by infrastructure companies should also be made qualified for tax saving," GCCI has stated.
