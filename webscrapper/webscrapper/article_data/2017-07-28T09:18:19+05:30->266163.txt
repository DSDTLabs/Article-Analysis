INDORE: A surprise visit by   (SDM) on Thursday exposed the   in government offices.

 SDM Pratul Sinha along with tehsildar Tapish Pandey visited a government high school in Dharnaka but no teachers turned up till 11.45am.
 
 “The school should start at 10.30am but the teachers had changed its timing as per their convenience. We have ordered that the classes be held as per the official schedule and have issued a show-cause notice to the teachers,” Sinha told TOI.
 
 He also found that sub-engineers posted in the public heath engineering department, a clerk at the nagar panchayat office and supervisors in the woman and child development department office were absent.
 
 The supervisors tried to mislead the SDM by giving him wrong information about them being out on field work.
 
 “We later confirmed that no supervisor was out on field work but were altogether absent. Show-cause notices have been issued to all the absentees. On the basis of their reply, further actions will be taken” Sinha said.
