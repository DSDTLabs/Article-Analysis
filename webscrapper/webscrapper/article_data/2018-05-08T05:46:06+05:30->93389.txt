MUMBAI: Construction of nearly 50% of piers for the 18.6 km-long   elevated corridor between DN Nagar and Dahisar via Link Road has been completed, an   official said. 

  
  
 “Nearly 481 of the total 957 piers have already been cast. Moreover, work is in progress on construction of all 17 stations,” said an official of   (MMRDA). 
 
 Kasturi Park in Malad will be the first station on the elevated corridor to be ready. 
 
 The official said, “We aim to complete the civil works by December 2018 or January 2019. There may be a delay of two to three months if there are any hurdles.” 
 
 The MMRDA has set a target of 2019 for the project, but delay in rolling stock procurement due to negotiations over loan and some issues with civil works lead to the corridor being commissioned in 2020. Work on this corridor commenced in 2016. The official said 95% of soil investigation work and 87% of utility works have also been completed. 
 
 Out of the 1430 girders to be laid, 513 have been cast (36%) and 363 erected (25%). MMRDA has invited bids for rolling stock (trains) after approval of loan from Asian Development Bank and New Development Bank. In April, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which is implementing the project, invited bids for the laying of the tracks. The work is expected to be completed by December.
