Kolkata: The Army rescued 680 people, including locals and tourists, from Sela Pass near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh on Monday. 

 The rescue operations in 320 vehicles continued till late into the night. 
 
 Situated nearly 13,700ft on the border between Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh, the pass connects the town of Tawang to Dirang and Guwahati.
 
 Those rescued included a one-and-a-half-year-old child who faced breathing difficulty and a 70-year-old tourist whose BP had spiked to more than 200. The critically ill patients were stabilized at the medical post at Ahirgarh and later evacuated.
 
 “More than 2ft of   fell since yesterday noon and a large number of vehicles got stuck in sub-zero temperatures between Ahirgarh and Sela Pass. Three rescue teams from the nearest base at Baisakhi worked till midnight. All the people and vehicles were brought to safety. One team led by Havildar Pr-asan Rai working north of Sela extricated 188 vehicles and nearly 400 civilians stuck inside them to the rescue ca-mp established at Jaswantgarh by 7.30pm from where they could move down on their own,” an Army officer said.
 
 Rescue work in sub-zero temperatures at an altitude of more than 13,000ft in a hazardous terrain under failing ambient light posed a formidable challenge. The troops of Baisakhi Brigade of the Blazing Sword Division under the Army’s Eastern Command toiled for more than seven hours to get all to safety. 
 
 Sudden heavy snowfall at the location had led to a massive rescue effort by the Army on March 18, 2017; 127 civilians were rescued.
