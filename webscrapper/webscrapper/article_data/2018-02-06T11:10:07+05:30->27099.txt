LUDHIANA: About 450 private schools affiliated to the Punjab   (PSEB) remained closed in the city on Monday, in protest against the state government’s move to introduce outside exam centres for the upcoming Class X and XII exams. 

 With the logjam between schools and the state government unlikely to be resolved soon, students said they were worried about what was in store for them. While PSEB schools could earlier conduct Class X and XII exams on their premises, the government has announced to allot government schools as exam centres for private ones this year and vice-versa. 
 
 A Class XII student, Sohan Singh, said his school had refused to provide transport for board exams. “My parents cannot drop and pick me from the exam centre. We were already anxious about the exams; this disagreement has added to the nervousness,” he said.
 
 Education minister Aruna Chaudhary has already refused to go back to the old formula for exam centres, saying that most schools allowed their students to cheat. The district secretary of   (RASA), Ranjeet Singh Saini, said they would now approach chief minister  . “We will decide on future course of action after meeting the CM on Tuesday,” he said.
