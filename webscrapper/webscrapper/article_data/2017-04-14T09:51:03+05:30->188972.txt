PATNA: RJD chief   on Thursday asked spokespersons of his party to counter the frequent allegations being levelled by senior BJP functionary Sushil Kumar Modi against him and his family members.

 Lalu, who convened a meeting at his 10, Circular Road residence, asked five spokespersons of the party to charge verbal arsenals against Modi and refute all allegations made by him.
 
 “Lalu ji said none of the allegations levelled by Modi is true and he (Modi) is just trying to give a bad name to his (Lalu’s) family in order to hog the limelight. The firms mentioned by Modi are very much legitimate and documents related to them, including involvement of   ji’s family, are in the public domain,” said one of the RJD spokespersons present at the meeting.
 
 Starting from April 4, Modi has levelled allegations against Lalu family for floating two shell companies – Delight Marketing Company Pvt. Ltd (now Lara Projects LLP) and A K Infosystems Pvt. Ltd. – for converting black money into white. Lalu’s wife and former CM   and his two minister sons – Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav – are directors in Lara, which is apparently the acronym for Lalu (La) + Rabri (Ra). Besides, Lalu’s two daughters – Chanda Lalu and   – are directors in A K Infosystems and 100% shares of the firm are owned by Rabri and Tejashwi.
 
 “Such attempts to defame Lalu ji and his family had been made in the past as well, but in vain. Modi wants to create a rift in the grand alliance by levelling false allegations and challenging CM   to take action,” said Mritunjay Tiwari, another RJD spokesperson. He added the spokespersons were also asked by Lalu to start preparations for a training camp for young party workers slated to be held at Rajgir from May 2 to 4.
