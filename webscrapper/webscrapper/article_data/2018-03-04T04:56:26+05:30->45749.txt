MUMBAI: A special   court on Saturday convicted and sentenced a 45-year-old deputy secretary from the Office of Protector of Emigrants, which is the ministry of external affairs, to four years' jail for demanding Rs 2 lakh   from a man to settle a CBI complaint. A lower divisional clerk,   (49), was also sentenced to two years imprisonment in the case. 

 The CBI had said that when   was at the Santacruz West office in 2008, he entered into a criminal conspiracy with Bose and they demanded a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from a private person on September 22, 2008 for settling a complaint with the CBI. The agency alleged that the complainant came to the office of Jambulkar, who, in turn, directed him to Bose to hand over the amount. Bose then directed the complainant to hand over the money to the employee of a private company. Bose then told the employee that he would visit his office in the afternoon and will collect the amount.
