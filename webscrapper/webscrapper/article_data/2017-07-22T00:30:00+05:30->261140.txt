Bengaluru: Faced with land and logistical issues, the state government’s pet project of establishing Indira canteens in 198 wards of Bengaluru has hit a roadblock, prompting it to set a new target.

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who chaired a multi-agency meeting on Friday to discuss the progress on the subsidized food joints, set a revised target: 125 canteens to open on August 15 and the remaining 73 on October 2, to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti.
 
 At the meeting, Siddaramaiah reportedly took officials to task for the delay in the project. But the officials told them the delay was largely because they couldn’t get possession of 67 sites from various government departments, where they proposed to set up the canteens.
 
 Officials told the CM that about 23 government departments are yet to hand over these sites to the BBMP, following which the CM issued stern orders to them to hand over the sites within the next three days. Of the 87 sites owned by various government departments identified to build canteens, the   has till date got only 36 sites, they told the CM.
 
 “The CM revised the target for the non-availability of suitable sites for canteens in 16 wards,” said Bengaluru development minister K J George, who also attended the meeting along with food and civil supplies minister U T Khader.
