RAIPUR: The   Kendra Vidyalaya ( ) has suspended a teacher, whose controversial statement on   stirred a storm in the country.

 KV-1 principal   said   Snehlata   was suspended and attached to another school on Wednesday evening after the complaint made by parents and girls against her was found to be true in initial investigation.
 
 
 “Based on a written complaint by the parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of the complaint, the panel submitted its preliminary investigation report to the KV deputy commissioner, who issued suspension orders,”   said.
 
 The teacher has been sent on temporary deputation to KV-2 till further orders. A high level inquiry will now be conducted against her by senior KV officials in Delhi, Ahire said.
 
 Shankhwar had allegedly converted her class into cringe worthy sermon sessions, telling students that ‘outgoing’ girls are asking for rape. In an audio clip secretly recorded by one of the students, the teacher is heard ‘warning’ girls against wearing jeans and lipstick as it attracts Nirbhaya-like ordeal. She is heard saying that it was “Nirbhaya’s mistake and not the boys”.
 
 “Girls have become so shameless, why did Nirbhaya go out so late at night with a boy who wasn’t her husband? It’s difficult to understand why an issue was made of this. Such incidents happen with girls in remote areas frequently. Nirbhaya’s mother shouldn’t have allowed her go out so late at night,” she allegedly said.
 
 She also allegedly told students that girls “expose their body only when they don’t have a beautiful face”.
 
 Shankhwar’s comments on Nirbhaya and girls’ dress sense had triggered nationwide outrage. On January 29, parents had marched to the school and demanded action against her. When the news got out, she tried to defend her statement.
 
 “What happened with Nirbhaya was wrong but she could have saved herself, if she had not gone out late,” she told media persons.
