RAJKOT: A man consumed poison at Rajkot police commissioner’s (CP) office due to harassment by moneylenders on Wednesday evening. Police identified the victim as Nile-sh Gohel (39), a resident of Ishwar Park, on Kotharia Road.

  Four years ago, Gohel had taken Rs 44 lakh credit on interest from Niraw Molia , a resident of Gitanjali Society in Rajkot; Kamlesh Sangani, who lives near Big Bazaar shopping centre in Rajkot; Vipul, a resident of Gondal, Rupesh Shah, Bipin Shah and Bhavesh Shah, all residents of Kotharia Road in Rajkot. 
 
 “Gohel alleged that despite making full payment of the credit with interest to the accused, they wanted to usurp his property, which is in the name of his uncle. Gohel came to make representation before the police commissioner, but he was not there in office. After this, he attempted suicide,” an official of Pradyumannagar police station said. Gohel has been admitted to civil hospital, where his condition is stable. No offence has been registered against him.
