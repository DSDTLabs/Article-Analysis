THANE: The crime branch arrested an   from a   mall in an Auragangabad   case on Thursday. 

 Santosh More, the accused, who was being tried a for the murder and was on the run since January 2017, was nabbed from   mall after the sleuths received information that he was visiting the place. The police said that More was involved in the murder of Anil Sharma, a local transporter, who was shot at point-blank range on the Ahmednagar Road. The severed body of Sharma was found in a sack in Kham river in   district, while his head was spotted in a drain on   on January 18 last year. 
 
 The police had nabbed More along with nine others and a trial was underway in a Vaijapur court. On January 24, 2017, when More was being taken to the Harsul Central Jail after a court hearing, he persuaded two constables escorting him to let him go to his house for lunch. He was being taken to the prison in a private car. While the constables gave in to his persuasion, More managed to give them a slip after reaching his house. 
 
 More was absconding since then and was hiding in different parts of Mumbai —Malvani, Dahisar, Malad etc.
 
 “We came to know that More would be visiting Cine Wonder mall area and so we deployed a team in plain clothes around the mall on Thursday. No sooner than he was spotted, our men nabbed him,” said inspector Nitin Thakare.
 
 It is learnt that the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court had pulled up the police for going soft on the accused.
