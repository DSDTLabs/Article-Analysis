A week after actor   gave a hint of his political entry,   said, "Given the current political scenario in  , I would say no one should enter politics. Not just Rajinikanth or any other actor. Any rational person will not do that. 

 Kamal's comment follows outrage expressed by some fringe outfits against Rajinikanth's possible entry into politics. When questions were asked about the opposition to Rajinikanth's entry citing that the superstar is not born as a Tamil,   said, "One's feeling as a Tamil is important rather than being born as a Tamil. Gandhi. Nehru, Bose are not Tamils by birth but many Tamil people keep the names of those leaders for their children. I am considered a Keralite by many Malayalees. If you ask whether I try to become the CM of Kerala, I would say I am not interested in that. "
 
 Speaking to reporters at an event here, he said, "Politics is about service and not about earning money. We must raise the salary for politicians and ask them to serve us well. But if you ask them to take it up as an act of sacrifice, they will use the opportunity in other ways." 
 
 Referring to Rajinikanth's remarks that the system is corrupt, Kamal said, "There is nothing wrong in what Rajinikanth said. The view is not new either."
