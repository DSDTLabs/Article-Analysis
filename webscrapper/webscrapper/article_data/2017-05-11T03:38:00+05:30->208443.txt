Panaji: In its aim to threaten the Manohar Parrikar-led government, the Congress has promised to put up a tough fight against Parrikar in the Panaji by-elections and is currently in talks with former Taleigao MLA and United Goans Party (UGP) chief Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate.

 While Monserrate is yet to clarify whether he will contest in Panaji against Parrikar, the Congress has not ruled out accepting Monserrate back in its fold.
 
 “We have a single-minded focus on defeating the communal forces of BJP. We are open to all options. I am in touch with all stakeholders, including Monserrate. We had a pre-poll alliance with him for the elections,” newly appointed Goa desk in-charge A Chellakumar said.
 
 Sitting BJP MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker, on Wednesday, resigned from the state legislature, paving the way for Parrikar to contest from his home turf.
 
 Earlier, Monserrate had hinted to TOI that he would contest from Panaji and attempt to defeat Parrikar if a byelection is held in Panaji constituency. 
 
 With the BJP scraping through with a wafer-thin majority of just 1,069 votes during the just concluded Goa assembly elections, Monserrate gave the BJP a brief scare. 
 
 Though the BJP managed to retain the former defence minister’s bastion, Monserrate indicated that he had the potential to dethrone Parrikar, who has represented Panaji since 1994.
 
 Monserrate won 6,855 votes while Kuncalienker won 7,924 votes. The Congress Party did not contest in Panaji.
 
 “Our first objective is to keep away this communal government, which was formed in an unethical way with money power. If Goa wants a clean government they have to vote this government out. We will definitely put up a strong candidate. We will call a meeting of block level leaders and the CLP to decide in the coming days,” Chellkumar said.
