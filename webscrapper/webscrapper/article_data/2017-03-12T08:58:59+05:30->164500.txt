PUNE: Visually challenged activists from the state would hold a demonstration at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on March 14 to seek ownership of land to construct a residential home for them.

 Pune district collector Saurabh Rao had referred the matter to the state government two years ago. But with no further action from the state government’s revenue department, the activists have decided to demonstrate in Mumbai.
 
 Activists Anil Khurana and   said two hectares in Sector 93/2 in Mauje Mohammadwadi had been awarded to the Poona Blind Men’s Association (PBMA) for a primary health centre and a residential home for the blind. But at present, the plot houses a hospital only. The land was granted to   over 20 years ago.
 
 After almost two decades, the district administration was convinced the land was allotted for both the purposes and acknowledged the lack of the home. However, the collector had referred the matter to the state government for the final order.
 
 Rangolle told TOI the state government had delayed their case.
 
 “We are aware of the violations and have referred the matter to higher authorities. We had even sent notices,” resident deputy collector   said. “The government will hear both the parties again and if there has been a violation, necessary action will be initiated,” he added.
