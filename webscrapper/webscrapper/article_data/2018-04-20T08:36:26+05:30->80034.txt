Union health minister   gave away awards to district hospital Jhunjhunu, district hospital   and Udaipur district’s community health centre situated in Nai. 

 National Health Mission director (state) Navin Jain said that all district hospitals secure marks on certain parameters. Those two securing highest marks get cash reward. Kayakalp awards are part of Swachh Bharat Mission. State nodal officer (Kayakalp awards), Dr   said, “There are six parameters on which district hospitals are judged. These parameters are hospital upkeep, sanitation and hygiene, bio medical waste management, Infection control and hygiene promotion.” 
 
 The top two district hospitals securing highest marks are felicitated by union health minister every year. One best CHC of the state is also felicitated along with two top district hospitals. 
 
 In 2017, Centre had awarded Hanumangarh and   district hospitals along with   in Jhunjhunu district. There is a set method of giving marks to district hospitals and community health centres under Kayakalp. Hospitals and CHCs conduct internal assessment first to find the gaps in services. Then, they fill these gaps.
