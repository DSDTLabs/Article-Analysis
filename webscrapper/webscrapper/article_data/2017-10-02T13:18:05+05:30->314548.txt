 Bhatia’s next project is the Telugu remake of the hit   starrer ‘Queen’. 

 The official remake of the hit was launched on Sunday in the presence of National award winner filmmaker G Neelakanta Reddy and producer Manu Kumaran, who will be making the film. The shooting of the Telugu remake will commence on October 25.
 
 While Tamannaah will be essaying the role in Telugu, Kajal Aggarwal will be seen in the Tamil remake of the same film, Manjima Mohan will be seen in Malayalam and Parul Yadav will be seen in the Kannada version. Talking during the launch, Tamannaah reportedly stated that she has always been motivated by roles that elevate women and empower them. She further stated that she can’t wait to begin shooting for the film.
 
 Tamannaah even unveiled the first look of the film on her social media, captioning the pictures, “On the way to launch #Queen #Queenonceagain Telugu.” (sic) The four remakes of ‘Queen’ are being helmed by separate directors. The Tamil and Kannada versions will be helmed by Ramesh Aravind. The Tamil version has been named ‘Paris Paris’ while the Malayalam version has been named ‘Zam Zam’. The filmmakers are yet to zero in on the director for the same. 
 
 Reports also state that Amy Jackson will be essaying the role of Lisa Haydon in all the remakes. While ‘Queen’ was a game-changer for Kangana Ranaut, winning her multiple National Awards, it remains to be seen how the movie will affect the actresses in the remakes.
