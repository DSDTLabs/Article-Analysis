PUNE: The   police on Sunday arrested a man from a village on the   border in connection with the murder of a woman, whose charred body was found in a nullah near the   bypass on December 31.

 Bajirao Mole, the senior inspector of Warje police station, said his team arrested the suspect, identified as  , 25, of Warje. The deceased woman has been identified as  , 28. She went missing on December 29, and her husband filed a missing person’s complaint. Her body was found on December 31.
 
 Police found that Gopal, a labour contractor, was also missing. Mole said Kavita used to work at construction sites as a labourer for Gopal. There could be two reasons for the murder. First, there may have been financial disputes, and second, they may have been in an illicit relationship, Mole said. “On December 29, Kavita met Gopal near the nullah, which also has a sewage pipeline. Both of them sat on the pipeline. While they were talking, Kavita accidentally fell. Gopal rushed down and on finding Kavita unconscious, he put her on some dried grass. He then set ablaze her and fled,” Mole said.
