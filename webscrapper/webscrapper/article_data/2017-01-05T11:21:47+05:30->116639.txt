HYDERABAD: Hundreds of protesting Ola and   drivers were taken into custody from Dharna Chowk at Indira Park on Wednesday. 

 Cabbies under the aegis of Telangana Cab Drivers' and Owners' Association (TCDOA), who began an indefinite hunger strike demanding scrapping of cab sharing system and ending of cab leasing scheme of taxi aggregators, were taken into custody as they did not vacate the protest site even after police issued multiple warnings.
 
 "The cabbies don't have permission for an indefinite strike. We clearly asked them to vacate the place by 5 pm. Even after extending permission by two hours, they did not vacate, so we forcefully detained them under section 151 of CrPC," M Sudharshan, Inspector, Chikkadpally, said. "We made them talk to our seniors. They were assured their problems would be brought to the notice of transport department." 
 
 On Wednesday, about 2,000 cabbies gathered at the Dharna Chowk and started an indefinite strike."It has been five days since we started striking, but till now neither taxi aggregators nor the state government responded. The police issued a warning that we can't stay here after 5 pm, but this is an indefinite strike and we intend to stay till our demands are met, even if we are taken into custody," V Shiva, president, TCDOA, said.
 
 Deepak Reddy, general manager, Uber Hyderabad, on Wednesday said that the issue would be resolved soon. "At Uber the safety of our driver partners and riders is our top priority. I want to assure you that we are taking all steps to address this situation. We have urged government authorities to step in to ensure safety...," Reddy said. Earlier in the day, the police denied cabbies permission to pay tribute to martyrs at Gun Park and take out a rally till Indira Park. Various organisations have come out in support of the cabbies.
