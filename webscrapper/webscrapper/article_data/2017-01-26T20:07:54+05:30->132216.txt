NEW DELHI: At a time when flight delays at Indian airports have become endemic and passengers troubled regularly by long waits to take off and land, the   (AAI) on R-Day launched its "central -   ( )" to cut flight delays. Airlines say Mumbai has become a "black spot" for flight delays due to air traffic congestion, followed by other busy airports like Delhi.

 AAI chairman  , who opened the dedicated C-ATFM facility at Delhiâ€™s new air traffic services complex on Thursday, said the authority is implementing this system at all major airports and then the entire Indian airspace. 
 
 "The C-ATFM system is primarily meant to address the balancing of capacity against the demand to achieve optimum utilization of the major resources like airports, airspace and aircraft at every Indian airport where there is a capacity constraint. ATFM Service relies on a number of supporting systems, processes and operational data which are already in place, for efficient management of air traffic flow across the country," said an official.
 
 Once implemented fully, AAI says ATFM will lead to annual fuel savings of Rs 1,680 crore by reducing fuel burn while hovering or waiting to land. Mohapatra said: "India is on the threshold of becoming seventh country in the world to implement the air traffic flow control measures across the nation which will accrue benefits in terms of reduced carbon foot print, embarking on green environment concept, fuel savings and economic benefits to the air travellers."
 
 The system displays weather information along with static information about airports, air spaces and air routes. It processes the demand/capacity information, provides decision making tools to the ATFM flow managers for collaborative decision making, in consultation with airlines, military and airports operators to facilitate the regulated flow of traffic in each airport in India.
