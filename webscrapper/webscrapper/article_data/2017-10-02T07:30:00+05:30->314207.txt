Mohali: The smart   system installed at Landran T-point by Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has become ineffective as it has failed to de-congest the T-point and regulate traffic flow.

 Recently, a high level meeting was also held at Mohali where the plan to ease the vehicular congestion at Landran T-point was discussed. Mohali deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra said, “The proposal was put before the secretary, PWD (B&R) Husan Lal regarding the approval for widening and construction of slips road to decongest the Landran T-point. Secretary has asked for complete report, along with designs and blue prints of the proposal, to construct the roads.” 
 
 As per the proposal, the Mohali administration plans to widen the existing road by another 50 feet on each side and construct slip roads from Mohali, Banur and Kharar side. Landran T-point connects Mohali with Banur, Fatehgarh Sahib and Kharar as alternate route for all the three destinations. According to the reports submitted by Mohali administration, over 5,000 vehicles cross the Landran T-point on a daily basis. 
 
 Sources in Mohali administration said the proposal also included construction of a flyover on Banur-Kharar road. 
 
 Another flyover has been planned to connect Mohali road with Fatehgarh Sahib Road.
