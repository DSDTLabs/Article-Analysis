PATNA: In an additional relief to   principal Dr S N Sinha, Bihar DGP P K Thakur on Tuesday directed Patna zone   to look afresh into the case of brawl between Dr Sinha and Dalit medico   on the PMCH premises on November 16 last year.
 
  The DGP’s directive comes close on the heels of the CID IG (weaker section) Anil Kishore Yadav’s order to the Patna police to arrest principal Dr Sinha. After supervising the case, IG Yadav had on February 11 also censured   (town) Kailash Prasad and other Patna police officers for their “failure” to deliver justice to a Dalit victim.
  
  The principal, meanwhile, moved a court for anticipatory bail and got relief as the court ordered that no coercive action be taken against him. While asking for the case diary from police, the court fixed February 28 as the next date for hearing the bail petition.
  
  When asked, DGP Thakur told TOI he sought a review of the supervision of the case after a delegation of doctors represented to him on Monday.
  
  Sources said IG Khan has been directed to review the supervision of not only Patna Police’s DSP, SP (city) and DIG but also IG Yadav. Yadav and Khan belongs to the same 1996 batch of IPS.
  
  “I am looking into the matter. In this regard, I had a meeting with City SP (central) Chandan  , DSP Kailash Prasad and the investigating officer of the case on Tuesday,” Khan told TOI, adding Kushwaha, in his supervision report, had also issued arrest orders against the principal.
  
  Sources said police would decide their future course of action in the case after Khan’s review report, which he said he would submit to the DGP soon.
