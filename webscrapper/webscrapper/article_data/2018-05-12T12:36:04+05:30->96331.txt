MARGAO: Chandor residents have decided to approach the town and country planning department seeking removal of the ‘state highway’ tag to the road passing through their village of historical importance. Locals were opposing the asphalting works citing damage to heritage structures in case road widening was undertaken in the future.

 PWD minister   told the villagers their interests would be protected. He urged people to allow the repairs as the stretch was in a bad state, and that fresh tendering post-tag removal would take at least a year.
 
 Chandor-Cavorim deputy sarpanch Mafaldina Martins told TOI people were not objecting to the tarring of the road but the SH-8 tag.
 
 “Dhavalikar partly agreed to our demands as he advised the officials to refrain from tarring the proposed SH-8 stretch and fill only potholes and hotmix the internal roads ,’’ said Mendes.
