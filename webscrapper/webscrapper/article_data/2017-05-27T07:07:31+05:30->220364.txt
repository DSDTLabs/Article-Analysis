PURULIAWEST MIDNAPORE: Nearly 9500  , including commandos and   (CIF), operating in the five   Extremism (LWE) districts are likely to get a   packet. 

 A high level committee headed by Union finance secretary   has recommended the abolition of `risk allowance'-a grant that's given to the state police by the Union home ministry as part of the compensation package in the LWE-affected districts.
 
 According to sources, roughly 9500 policemen are operating in the 37 LWEaffected police stations spread over five districts -West Midnapore, Jhargram, Purulia, Bankura and Birbhum. â€œThis 'risk allowance' is 30% of their basic and grade pay .
 
  Officers in the rank of sub-inspector get an additional amount of Rs 4000 to Rs 4500, an ASI gets an amount of Rs 3000 to 3500 and in case of a constable it's around Rs 2200 to Rs 2600.They are getting this from November 2009 after the joint operation started in these areas," a senior district police officer said. 
 
 Though the district police are yet to get any order from Nabanna, they are certain that the allowance will be withdrawn very soon.
 
 The state home department officials are of the opinion that this is another step towards stripping off the LWE tag for the districts following `zero' deaths and   of   in the last five years.
