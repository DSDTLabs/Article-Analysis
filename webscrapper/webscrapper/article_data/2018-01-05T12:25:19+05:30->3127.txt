PANAJI: Kerala-based trader  , who was arrested in the alleged Rs 35,000 crore alleged illegal   scam, has approached the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking that the main FIR in the case be quashed for being based “only” on the   report. 

 Jacob took objection to the FIR because he said the government had stated in the   that no action would be taken against mining lessees solely on the basis of the findings reported by the Justice M B Shah Commission and without the state making its own assessment of facts. The government had stated that the mining lessees would be given an opportunity to be heard and produce evidence in their defence before action was taken.
 
 The Goa Police, in its reply before the high court, said the complaint of the competent authority (mines department) was not based on the findings of the Shah Commission report.
 
 “The complainant has specifically mentioned the cognisable offences and requested that and FIR be registered against all the persons against whom there is prima facie evidence that offence has been committed under various acts and rules,” SIT PI  , said.
 
 The police said the present complaint filed by the director of mines is based particularly on his own assessment of facts with regard to the theft of iron ore in Goa. “There is no direction from the apex court that legal action cannot be taken against a person involved in the theft of iron ore and other illegalities,” Sawant said.
