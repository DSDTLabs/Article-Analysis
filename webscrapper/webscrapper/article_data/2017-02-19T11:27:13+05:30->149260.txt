NAGPUR: Deputy mayor Satish Holey’s son Mayur and his four aides have been slapped with charges of alleged bribe under Section 171E of Indian Penal Code (IPC) by Sakkardara police on Saturday. Satish is contesting election on   ticket from Prabhag 31 in south Nagpur. 

 According to sources, police were tipped off about Mayur along with his accomplices distributing cash through some coupons among women at   to influence voters for the coming election. A team of Sakkardara police, under PI  , reached there and recovered few coupons from the premises of a temple at Anand Nagar where the coupons were being distributed. 
 
 Police, however, did not find any objectionable thing, including cash or whatsoever, on the coupons as the one side of the coupons had the image of Saibaba with a message, ‘sabka malik ek hai’, on top and other side was left blank. 
 
 Police are investigating the motive behind the coupons distribution. The team quizzed some women, who apparently belonged to lower economic strata, regarding the coupon but failed to get any satisfactory reply. “We have registered a non-cognizable case in the matter against Mayur and four others,” said Nerlekar.
