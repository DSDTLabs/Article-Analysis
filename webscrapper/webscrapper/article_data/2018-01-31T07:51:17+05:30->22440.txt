CHARMINAR: A newly-laid BT Road is being dug up for laying a cable at Rakshapuram Colony near Santosh Nagar. Taking to Twitter to express their angst, residents alleged that the reason for the new road being dug up is the lack of co-ordination between departments.

 The issue came into light after   spokesperson Amjad Ullah Khan tweeted about the issue. Khan also asked the   commissioner to give orders to GHMC South Zone zonal commissioner to take action against those responsible for digging.
 
 “This is how our system is working, newly laid BT Road by @GHMCOnline is being dug for laying of Cable...,” he tweeted. Another resident of Old City, Kiran   (@kirankumargoli) said, “Pains (sic) to see how tax money is wasted. Agency digging the road should lay the BT road at zero cost to tax payer.”
 
 GHMC south zonal commissioner   said, “We do not give permission, unless it is absolutely necessary.”
