Surat: Traffic cops in the polluted Varachha area can breathe healthy air while on duty.  A city-based non-governmental organization (NGO) in association with traffic police have launched a pilot project to provide oxygen concentrators to the traffic cops. If the project is successful, the machine will be provided at all the important traffic junctions in the city. The US-made oxygen concentrator worth Rs 40,000 was provided at Varachha traffic chowky by Shree Jinagna Seva Trust (SJST). The oxygen concentrator helps inhale more oxygen to a user. It cleans the air and supplies it through tubes for the user. “We are planning to provide more oxygen concentrators and started the pilot project from Varachha since traffic density is higher in this area. This equipment is popular world over and has high standards,” Piyush Shah of SJST said. “Traffic on city roads is increasing every day. Policemen stay on the road for the entire day and their work is more hectic during heavy traffic. They are in need of clean air and therefore we gifted the unit to traffic police,” Shah added. “The level of pollution on road is high due to heavy traffic and policemen breathe polluted air. It adversely impacts their health. But by breathing with help of the oxygen concentrator for 10 minutes in morning and evening, it benefits a lot,” deputy commissioner of police, traffic, B R Pandor said. “The unit is donated to the traffic police with a noble cause and it is maintenance free since it requires only electricity. The trust will donate few more similar units,” Pandor added.
