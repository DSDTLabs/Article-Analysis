 Amanda Fantry, who did her medical school from New York, is in city and assisting Shah at his Sunshine Global Hospital since January 5. “My university started a voluntary program where fellows can visit different countries for few weeks and get global exposure. Since I wanted to work under foot and ankle specialist, I chose to come to India after getting reference from a doctor at Duke University,” said Fantry.

Shah told TOI: “To allow Fantry to conduct surgeries and assist me, we had to take permission from the  . Her visit was finalized after we got the permission from the council.”
 
 “In India doctors deal with and operate on patients with limited resources and innovative techniques. Back in US, the methods of surgery are same as here but to work with limited resources and innovative techniques is worth learning,” said Fantry, who is going to apply for fellowship in foot and ankle surgery after her current fellowship ends.
