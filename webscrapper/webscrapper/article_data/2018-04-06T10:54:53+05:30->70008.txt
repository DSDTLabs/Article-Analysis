A dawn-to-dusk bandh called by the DMK and its allies on Thursday to condemn the Centre’s failure to constitute a   management board evoked a mixed response in   with most shops remaining closed, but most essential services, including public transport being partially affected.

 Train services were affected in some places due to rail rokos and most autorickshaws and cabs were off the roads. As per police reports, at least 59,302 agitators were arrested. Separately, 13,015 people were arrested for squatting on railway tracks and 907 held for staging demonstrations.
 
 The police arrested around 398 people for burning effigies and 20 more for damaging windshields of about 45 MTC and   buses, booked under separate Sections of IPC.
 
 In Chennai, 6,000 protesters including 12 DMK legislators, and members of   and other parties were arrested in 51 incidents including sit-in protests on railway tracks.

A MTC official said protests were by and large peaceful.
 
 DMK working president M K Stalin, TNCC chief S Thirunavukkarasar, Dravida Kazhagam leader K Veeramani and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan were arrested when they staged a blockade on Anna Salai and were marching towards Anna Memorial. After Stalin was arrested, DMK workers turned violent, some of them toppling barricades. Almost all those arrested were released late in the evening, while those held for stone-throwing were sent to jail.

 A senior police officer said, “Had the agitators been allowed to run free, the impact would have been huge on Kamarajar Salai. We placed many hurdles in their path following information that DMK workers planned to barge on to Marina Beach.”
