NASHIK: A section of farmers have continued their opposition to the state government's move to acquire their land for construction of the Nagpur-Mumbai expressway.

 Some farmers have hung nooses on trees and set up pyres on their farms to send a message to the government that they would rather embrace death than part with their land. 
 
 “We will not give our land at any cost. The government can construct the highway through the nearby hills where nothing grows; the farmers there would be more than happy to get compensation,“ said   of Shivade village, as he prepared a pyre in his farm.
 
 The protests come in the wake of the district administration announcing rates for direct purchase of land through negotiations saying if the move fails, forced acquisition would be the only way out. Earlier, the farmers had hung nooses in their farms when land measurement was being carried out.
 
 “Every step the administration takes for land acquisition, will see our protests escalate. This time we are preparing the pyres and it is for us,“ said  , a local.   of Sonambe village questioned the project. “Small pieces of land being taken away for public projects can be understood. This is not a common public road; it will have controlled access,“ he said. “The day the government tries to take over the land we will end our lives,“ Sunil Wagh, another farmer warned.
