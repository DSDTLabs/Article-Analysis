Ahmedabad: There was a panic among passengers and crew alike when the Delhi-bound   flight from Ahmedabad aborted its   at the very last minute, as an Ahmedabad-bound IndiGo   from Bangalore, had not cleared the runway at   (SVPI) late on Friday. 

 The IndiGo flight was barely on the taxiway when crew reported seeing   and immediately stopped, according to the airport officials. Consequently, the SpiceJet flight that was to take-off next was delayed by around two and a half hours.
 
 SpiceJet officials said there were 142 passengers aboard their Delhi-bound flight. “The incident occurred on Friday night. IndiGo flight 6E-166 landed at around 9 pm. Soon after, the SpiceJet flight received take-off clearance from the air traffic controller (ATC). Meanwhile, the IndiGo crew reported to the ATC that the runway could not be vacated as there were rabbits on the taxiway. The take-off clearance for SpiceJet was immediately cancelled,” said a well-placed source in the city-airport.
 
 The incident sparked speculation that a collision was narrowly averted. The airport authority officials denied this. 
 
 The IndiGo aircraft was at the end of the runway, while the SpiceJet one was ready for the take off at the other end. There was no possibility of a collision. However, had the SpiceJet flight accelerated to take-off speed, the situation could have been precarious,” said an official.
 
 SpiceJet officials said, “The aircraft backtracked and lined up on the runway after being cleared for take-off by the ATC. However, the ATC soon instructed the SpiceJet pilots to hold position as the runway was not vacant. Following this, SpiceJet pilots rejected the take-off and returned to the bay. At all times, the SpiceJet pilots followed the ATC instructions.”
 
 The SpiceJet flight immediately returned to base for the necessary checks. The city airport officials added that the SpiceJet flight was delayed for nearly 150 minutes due to the incident. IndiGo officials were unavailable for comment.
