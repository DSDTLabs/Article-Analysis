RAIPUR: Jashpur district administration has come up with a unique way to validate the   status of its villages, where 49,189 students of primary and middle schools secretly submitted the names of villagers from across the state who still go out for open defecation. This system is being called 'Swacchata ballot'. 

 Talking to TOI, Jashpur collector   said, " Around 400 panchayats in the district are ready to be declared   but convincing the villagers to make a permanent change in their habits is a challenge. Hence, in order to change their behavior pattern and sensitize children against practice of open defecation, district administration conducted   in 1987 schools." 
 
 Once the list of defaulters is prepared by the 'Swacch' monitoring teams of each panchayat, special awareness sessions for them will be conducted by the monitoring teams. 
 
 The collector also added that a second ballot will be conducted after a certain gap after the special awareness sessions.
 
 To make the mission successful, this campaign was conducted on different levels for the villagers and panchayat secretaries since the last 15 days.
