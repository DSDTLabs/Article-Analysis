PANAJI: People should be more worried about Rajasthan’s health minister promoting drinking of cow urine, than being concerned about girls drinking beer, senior   leader   said on Sunday in Goa.

 The senior Congress leader was speaking to mediapersons about Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s comment expressing concern about the increase in the number of girls consuming beer.
 
 “I don’t want to be facetious, but a lot of people are worried about the health minister of Rajasthan promoting cow urine. I think people should be more worried about drinking cow urine than being worried about people drinking beer, that too of all places in Goa. I don’t think these kind of comments actually deserve any response to tell you the truth,” said Khurshid, speaking on the sidelines of the conference Difficult Dialogues on gender equality being hosted in Goa.
 
 Khurshid also said that the legislation against triple talaq had no meaning after the   judgement on the Islamic practice. 
 
 “After the apex court ruling saying talaq three times had no meaning, what is the need of bringing in a legislation to stop someone from saying something that has no meaning? And what is the sense in punishing that person? You are punishing someone for something that has no meaning. I think this will be the only legislation of this kind in the world where people are punished for meaningless words that they utter. I hope the Congress is able to mobilise all opposition against such a legislation,” said Khurshid.
