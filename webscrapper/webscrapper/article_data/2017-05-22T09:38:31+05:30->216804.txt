BHUBANESWAR: Despite failing to cash in on the  's alleged failures and controversies in recent  , the   on Sunday asserted that it would bounce back in next two years when   goes to polls. 

 Addressing mediapersons on a day when the BJD completed three years in power of its fourth consecutive term, Congress state president   said the opposition party is committed to expose the ruling party's alleged corruption and nepotism.
 
 "We might have failed to capitalise on the BJD's failures during panchayat elections. We admit we failed to perform well in the rural polls. But the party's poor performance has not affected our commitment. We will continue to fight against BJD," Prasad told reporters.
 
 He said the Congress will intensify its activities in the next two years. "We will reach out to the people and highlight failures of the BJD in every spheres, including health, education, agriculture and social security, among others. We did it in the run-up to the panchayat elections, though we did not get success," Prasad said against the backdrop of growing infighting and resentment against his leadership. 
 
 Demanding ouster of Prasad, a group of Congress leaders met Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi several times in Delhi. 
 
 The BJD said the Congress has been rejected by people in the state and several other states. People have tremendous faith in BJD government for its welfare measures. The Congress is desperate to hog headlines by raising non-issues, said a BJD spokesperson.
