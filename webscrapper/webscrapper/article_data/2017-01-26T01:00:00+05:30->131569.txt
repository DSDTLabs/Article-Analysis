Reinforcement was sent to rein in the unruly monks, who were resisting encroachment removal.

 As per reports, complaints of encroachment made by the Cambodian monastery were received by revenue department officials. On record verification and actual measurement, the complaints were found true. When the CO, along with local police, started removing encroachments, the monks allegedly assaulted the CO.
 
 Gaya DM Kumar Ravi said the anti-encroachment exercise was temporarily suspended after the violence. “The encroachment will be effectively removed,” the DM said. A criminal case against the offenders would be registered, he added.
 
 As per revenue records, nearly two dozens out of over 50 monasteries at Bodh Gaya and its neighbouring areas have been encroached by violating building laws. They have been served notices several times to remove the encroachments, but none of the monasteries paid any heed.

On December 30 the same year, Bangladesh monastery managers, in open defiance of the construction ban imposed by the  , went on with illegal construction and indulged in violence against officials responsible for the ban enforcement. A criminal case was instituted against Bangladesh monastery managers, but little has been heard in the case since then.
