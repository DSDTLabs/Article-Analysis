CHENNAI: Having first come to India in 2006 and camped in Chennai soon after in 2007 announcing   plans,   who made Chennai his home for 11 years is moving out of the city with a heavy heart.

 “I like this city. It has treated me very well,” Marc   said. “With a population of more than seven million people, Chennai is a pretty big city. But the pace of life is much better than it makes you feel the city is smaller,” hesaid.
 
 “Chennai airport is a very difficult airport when compared with Bengaluru, Hyderabad or Mumbai. We need a better airport with posh ambience. This is just not there when you compare with other airports,” hesaid.
 
 Llistosella also wanted the civic authorities to maintain clean beaches. “You all must utilise the beaches better. Open defecation on the beach makes thislovely place a dirty one. It’s a pity that such a wonderful place is so dirty,” he said.
 
 “Mumbai is a tough city and is bursting like New York. Delhi is an amazing city but highly polluted. I liked Hyderabad whileBengaluru isover hyped. While Chennai is ideally paced great city,” hesaid.
 
 Having lived in Akkarai on ECR, Llistosella said   where two of his children went (he is a father of six children) was very good.
 
 “We were very lucky that we did not meet any accidents and on that we were blessed with good luck,” he said, “something of mine will always stay in Chennai.” He bid adieutoChennai.
