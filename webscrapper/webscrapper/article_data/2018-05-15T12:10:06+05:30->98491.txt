PANAJI: The Aam Aadmi Party has criticized chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s video message to   party workers on Sunday, stating that Parrikar should have addressed the people of Goa first.   leader Valmiki Naik said that Parrikar’s address was stage managed for political gain. “It exposes the fact that the people of Goa do not take precedence over his party,” Naik said.

 In his first direct public communication, Parrikar, who left for the US in early March for medical treatment, said in a video message that he expects to be in Goa “within the next few weeks.” The video was played at BJP president Amit Shah’s meeting in Bambolim. 
 
 AAP also criticized Shah for not meeting alliance partners despite their sizeable strength in the government. It also alleged that the   was more concerned about an audience with Amit Shah than dealing with issues. 
 
 The party also come out in support of Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares’ locking of the mines department office. “The department of mines is abetting the crime of theft of ore and large scale violations,” Naik said. “Instead of booking him, they should have booked the mines minister, secretary and director.”
