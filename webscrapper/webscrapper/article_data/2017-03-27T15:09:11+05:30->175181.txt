 is on a professional high these days, thanks to the reviews his latest film ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’ has received from both the critics and the audience. Unlike his co-star, 
  who plans to take a break for a while to pursue other interests,   is already geared up for his next project. 

 The film has been lauded for its fresh take on feminism, quirky dialogues and brilliant performances by Varun and Alia. However, there was a scene in the movie that snowballed into a controversy. The said scene shows Varun’s character   being touched inappropriately and molested, while   Bhatt’s character laughs it off, Badri is left visibly shattered. This scene received some major criticism and flak from sections of the audience and critics. 
 
 When quizzed about his opinion, Varun reasoned that, “Out of 10, if two don’t like something, that doesn’t count as mass opinion. People who felt that way are entitled to their opinion” and he’s totally fine with it. He added that it was supposed to be a “funny scene” and “meant to portray how Badri’s male ego is being shattered”. He added, “In 3 Idiots, there’s a scene where a character confuses a Hindi word for `balatkar’. People should have been offended by that as well. We didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s sentiments and if we did so unknowingly, we apologise.”
