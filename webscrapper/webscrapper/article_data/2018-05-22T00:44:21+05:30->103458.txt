Kanyakumari: Health department officials in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts, which share their boundaries with Kerala, have sounded a red alert to all the primary health centres, private and government hospitals following the outbreak of   virus in Kerala. While the hospitals have been asked to check if anyone has symptoms similar to brain fever, officials have appealed to the public not to panic.

 In all, the alert has been given to the more than 450 hospitals in these two districts. In the past any infection of fever such as dengue that spread in Kerala has spread fast in Kanyakumari, as a sizeable population from here work in the construction and others sectors there.
 
 This has left people of this bordering district gripped in fear as rumours are also being circulated by word of mouth and on social media. Kanyakumari district collector Prashant M Wadnere has appeal to the public not to believe rumours pertaining to the rare virus and also assured that the health department is working in full swing to curtail the spread of the virus if it spreads to the district, the chances for which are remote.
 
 A circular has been sent to 141 private hospitals, 11 government hospitals and 42 primary health centres in the district to be on alert if anyone got admitted with strange or severe fever and to alert the health department officials and the district administration immediately. They have also been asked to inquire such patients if they worked or travel to or though Kerala to check the place of origin of the fever.
 
 The hospitals have also been asked to isolate such patients and to handle them with care. Even before the patient tests positive for Nipah, doctors and nurses treating and attending them have been advised to wear gloves and a mask to prevent them from contracting the disease. The advisory comes as a nurse in a government hospital at Perambra in Kozhikode, treating Nipah patients was infected and died.
