CHARMINAR: A cement concrete road was laid in  , a month after TOI highlighted the pathetic condition of the road with overflowing drains and broken manhole covers in the locality.

 Though the matter was brought under the notice of concerned authorities several times by residents, no work was initiated.
 
 One of the motorists, Mohammed Abdul   said how the battered road was a nightmare for everyone passing though this stretch. Traffic heading towards Ambedkar nagar and Tappachabutra and motorists commuting through   and   have a tough time.
 
 “A newly constructed cement road will give motorists smooth and hurdle-free ride. I appreciate how local leaders and authorities finally responded to the repeated please made by the residents," Samad added.
 
 Expressing gratitude, another resident Sadat said that authorities should regularly maintain the road now.“The entire lane looks neat and clean. Prior to this, passing through this lane, especially during night was risky. Its a great relief to Mustaidpura residents and shopkeepers," Sadat added.
