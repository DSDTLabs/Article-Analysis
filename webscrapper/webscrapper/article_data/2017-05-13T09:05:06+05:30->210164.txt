HUBBALLI: Even as his classmates were busy browsing websites to know their SSLC results, this boy was grazing cattle at Balehosur village in Gadag district.

 Manjunath Sandli, who scored 96.62% in the SSLC examination, would have a busy day, packed with school and work. 
 
 As his father Buddappa, who owns non-irrigation agricultural land of 4 acres, had to work in other's fields to repay a loan of Rs 40,000 taken for the diploma course of his other son and daughter, Manjunath worked in his family fields till 8pm. He studied from 8.30pm till midnight.
 
 Manjunath said he had been following the same routine since high school. “As my brother Irappa and sister Hanumavva are doing diploma third and second year respectively, I had to support my father in all the work. My mother Yallavva is bed-ridden due to paralysis for over four years,“ he said.
 
 His father   said: “As son Irappa scored 89% and stood second in Shirahatti taluk and daughter Hanumavva scored 70%, it was difficult to meet their education expenses. I also have to take care of my wife. The income obtained by cultivation of 4 acres is limited due to drought. I used to work in other's fields to repay the loan of Rs 40,000. So, Manjunath had to work in our fields. With his help, I'm free of all loans now. But there are fresh worries as Manjunath has scored 604 out of 625.“
 
 Manjunath would like to become a doctor and serve patients but his father is apprehensive about getting a Science seat in a good college.
 
 “He is willing to join a pres tigious institution in   or Udupi district,“ he added.
 
 Shivanand Gidnandi, headmaster,  , said Manjunath is a role model for poor and rural students. “He would often go to the fields directly after school. When we suggested he should study some more, he'd say he had no time. But he has been at the top in academics.His parents are illiterate but encouraged him to study well. But the family needs financial help,“ he said.
