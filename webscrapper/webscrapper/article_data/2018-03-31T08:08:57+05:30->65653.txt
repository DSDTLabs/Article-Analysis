BHOPAL: A   was intoxicated, kidnapped and raped for months. She was taken from Bhopal to New Delhi and was confined in a room where the accused repeatedly outraged her modesty.

 She was not allowed to move out of the room. Her ordeal lasted for five months. One day, she managed to return home and lodged a complaint at the Misrod police station.
 
 Police said there were three accused in the case -- one of them raped the girl while his two accomplices helped in kidnapping the girl.
 
 Police said the survivor is a resident of Hoshanbagad road in Bhopal. She worked in a mall. The incident took place on November 24, 2017, when she was heading for work in the morning. One of the accused, Tarun, who worked with her in the same mall, came to her and offered her Prasad laced with sedatives.
 
 The girl stated she lost conscious after eating the prasad and Traun along with his two friends abducted her in a vehicle. When she gained conscious, she realised that she was in New Delhi.
 
 She came to know this after hearing Tarun talking to someone over phone and sharing his location. Police said the girl stated he would outrage her modesty often and did not allow her to move out of the room.
 
 The arrangement of her food was made in the room itself by the accused, police added.
 
 However, on March 28 she got a chance to escape from the clutches of accused. She went to New Delhi railway station and boarded a train to Bhopal.
 
 On reaching her home, she narrated her plight to her family. She was in poor condition and was taken to hospital by her family and later to police where she got a case registered against the accused and his two friends, who are yet to be identified, police said, adding that a team would be sent to New Delhi in search of the accused.
