THANE: With temperatures   every single day, cold drink and fresh fruit juice sellers have been making brisk business as the demand for such drinks has increased.

 At almost every street corner across the city, one will find a stall set up selling fresh cut fruits, juices, sugarcane juice and other cold drinks. During  , these stall owners rake in the moolah as almost everyone travelling in the heat will stop by to quench their thirst. 
 
 Although fresh fruit juice scores more over aerated colas, most people often opt for light meals such as a plate of fresh fruit or a glass of chaas or lassi. Most lemon juice vendors sell anything between 150 to 200 glasses a day. And on weekends these numbers go up to 300 to 350. “Customers always want something to quench their thirst,” said Ganesh Pawar, a seller.
 
 Sugarcane juice vendors are in most demand as this is the best summer cooler and it is easily available almost everywhere. “Sugarcane is bought from the wholesale market, sometimes thrice a week if there is a demand,’’ said Nitin Tawde, a sugarcane seller.
 
 Meanwhile, college students and working professionals at times give their meals a skip and stick to a plate of fruits which is high on flavour as well as nutrition. ‘‘Fruit plates are complete value for money. Most students find it affordable and also filling,’’ said Manish Gaikwad, a student. While some sellers only serve watermelons, others serve a mix of oranges, sweet lines, kiwis, bananas and chickoos. 
 
 However, there are some who prefer water to colas and other juices. Many companies have started packing water in small carry-size bottles as it is easy for a person to carry. ‘‘Water is the only thing that can quench a person’s thirst. Colas and juices do not satisfy you,’’ said Kashmira Sinha, a working professional. Many vendors also sell packaged water bottles at signals and stations.
