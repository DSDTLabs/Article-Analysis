The feast of the Epiphany, also known as the  , will be celebrated at Cansaulim today.

 The feast mass will be concelebrated at 10.30am with archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao, as the main celebrant, and devotees from every nook and corner of Goa will be seen flocking to the Nossa Senhora dos Remedios Chapel at Cuelim with great reverence and devotion.
 
 Three young boys from the villages of Cansaulim, Arossim and Cuelim have been selected to enact the Three Kings, also known as the ‘Magi’ or the ‘Wise Men from the East’, who followed the guiding star to worship the child Jesus. These three boys travel on horseback through three different traditional footpaths and converge some distance from the chapel, from where they proceed together. They return home by a different way, totally transformed, resolving to follow Christ.
 
 The chapel is atop the 100m-high Cuelim hill. It is famous because of the feast of the Three Kings, celebrated every January 6. It was founded by Fr Gonsalo Carvalho, SJ, circa 1599, and is affiliated with St Thomas Church, Cansaulim. The chapel was said to be renovated in 1795 and the privilege to organize and celebrate the feast is given to the   (native villagers) of the comunidade of Cansaulim, Arossim and Cuelim. It is this inheritance that the boys; Alec Gracias, son of Apollo Gracias of Cansaulim, Nolan Bosco Fernades, son of Pifran Fernandes of Arossim, and  , son of Franklin Sequeira of Cuelim beget, by their anointing to participate in the kingship, prophetic mission and the royal priesthood of Jesus.
 
 Horses from Kolhapur, flagbearers, the firecracker igniter and the brass band have all been organized to commence this celebration going back four centuries. Devotees are requested not to bring their vehicles but to park them at St Thomas Church, Cansaulim, Our Lady of Assumption Church, Velsao, and the chapel at Ossoilem. Shuttle bus services have been arranged at the parking lots.
