JAIPUR: The new Goods and   ( ) regime has not gone down well with the   in the   of Jaipur. 

 It has brought all idols of Hindu gods in the tax bracket for the first time. These were earlier VAT-free and had no excise duty. Almost 10 days after the introduction of GST, idol makers are still demanding a rollback of GST on idols of Hindu deities as they feel it would spell doom for this large ancient industry of Jaipur. They are hoping that government would give some relaxation as idols were earlier free of VAT and excise duty.
 
 Jaipur, which is also known as 'Choti Kashi,' has an abundance of idol makers since the period when kings ruled Rajputana. More than 7,000 sculptors live in areas such as Khajane Walon Ka Raasta, Bhindon Ka Rasta, Kalyan Ji Ka Rasta and Khejron Ka Rasta. They are either sitting idle or they have halted the delivery of idols, mainly of Hindu deities, till there is clarity on GST and possible rollback. From about a week ago, over 3,000 shops and workshops making idols and sculptures, situated in the Walled City, have remained shut. "It is unfair to impose GST on statues of Hindu deities when they were free of VAT and excise duty. Some people are saying that GST on idols is 28% since they are made of marble while many are still are confused over the tax slab," said Naresh Moortiwala, an idol maker at Kalyan Ji Ka Rasta, on Monday. Shambhu Dayal, a 67-year-old man who owns a sculpture shop at Bhindon Ka Rasta, said, "They have imposed 28% GST on marble and majority of the idols of Hindu deities are made from marble. Many a time, when the idol is ready its nose or other parts get broken. In such cases, we have to redo it all over and the damaged piece becomes waste. In such a scenario, we are actually giving delivery of a 'previous' order, and hence cannot give a proper bill or invoice."
