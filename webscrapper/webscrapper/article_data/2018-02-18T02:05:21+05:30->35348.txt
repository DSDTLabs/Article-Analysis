MUMBAI: Police sub-inspector Daya  , who was recently given a clean chit in a corruption charge against him, has been promoted to the rank of assistant police inspector and shown as being posted to Nagpur. Last week a special court accepted the closure report submitted by the anti-corruption bureau ( ) in a disproportionate assets case. 

 ACB had filed the closure report as there was no evidence against him and that is the reason why the sanction was rejected thrice by the government as well as director-general of police. Nayak, who had been suspended for nearly five and a half years, was reinstated in 2012. 
 
 In 2010, when the ACB had submitted the closure report, it had said the competent authority had refused to grant sanction to prosecute him. Sources said he is expecting another promotion to the rank of police inspector by the end of this week. Nayak is among many officers promoted on Saturday.
