 Petitioners and domiciles of MP, Prithvi Naik, Shailaja Pandey and Priyanshu Agrawal contended that they had obtained good marks in NEET and they were sure of getting an admission in a medical college in the state. Following the order of the high court, Supreme Court also asked for re-counselling for admission. In keeping with the directive, two rounds of counselling were carried out, however, for the remaining seats, counselling was held on September 9 and 10, 2017. 
 
 The petitioners alleged that private medical colleges sold the seats for Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Since there was no action on complaints lodged by them, they were forced to move the high court, their counsel said. 
 
 Counsel for the petitioners said that even those domicile students who got admission in mop-up round had obtained less than 50% marks, violating the   (MCI) guidelines.
