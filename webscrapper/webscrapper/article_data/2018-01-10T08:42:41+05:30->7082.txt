SURAT:   (SMC) has issued notices to 1,571 shops and establishments in the past two days for displaying their boards and products in a much bigger size than permitted under   (GDCR) in the city. 

 SMC has demanded charges of Rs 3.25 crore from them for undertaking commercial advertisements.   from advertising constitutes a major part of income for municipal corporations. 
 
 As against Ahmedabad’s Rs 80 crore yearly income, Surat gets just Rs 10 crore revenue from advertising. SMC has framed a new policy and plans to generate at least Rs 100 crore   in the near future. It plans to regularize all forms of advertisements taking place in the city. However, some elected representatives have called SMC’s action against shops and establishments unjustified. 
 
 “GDCR allows establishments to display boards up to two feet only. Owners of malls and shops of buildings facing roads have used up the entire walls for display of their names and products. These are commercial advertisements and charges would be calculated accordingly,” an SMC officer said. 
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “It is time we get rid of chaos. Every municipal corporation gets its income from advertisements. Our survey found that more than 100 per cent people compared to people who paid for charges were not paying up what is due to the civic body.” 
 
  councillor and former standing committee chairman Nirav Shah said, “If I display a 200 feet board on my premises, can you regulate me? Why was this not implemented earlier when this regulation exists since 2013? The rates have to be fixed by the standing committee and general board of SMC only.”
