Vadodara: Even after Vadodara district education officer (DEO) issued a circular on Friday   to keep fee hike on hold, parents continued their protest against fee hike. 

 On Saturday, over 150 parents, whose wards are enrolled at Bright Day School’s   unit at Harni, staged protests by holding banners, placards and raising slogans against the fee hike introduced by the school’s management. With placards reading ‘Don’t play with students future,’ and ‘Stop treating parents as ATM machine,’ parents staged a demonstration outside school compound after which they were called for a meeting inside the school. 
 
 “While the total fee of standard III was Rs 39,500, for class IV to VIII was Rs 41,000 and class IX and X was Rs 44,000, the total fee of standard III this year is Rs 43,500, between class IV and VIII it is Rs 45,000 and for standard IX and X students it is Rs 49,000 this year. We made a strong representation against this,” said an agitating parent. 
 
 Parents have also been asked to pay Rs 7,500 for brunch facility instead of Rs 7,000 as collected last year, bringing the fee hike to nearly 15 per cent.
 
 School principal  , however, told TOI that since receiving circular, the school has decided not to increase fees till further directives. 
 
 “We have intimated the decision to parents. We have informed them that if they have not paid fee so far, they should not pay the fee till there are further directives,” she said. tnn
