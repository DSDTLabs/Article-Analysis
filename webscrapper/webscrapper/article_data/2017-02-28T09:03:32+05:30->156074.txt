MUMBAI: Taking a leaf out of Kerala tourism, the state will soon start operating   between the waters of Marve-Manori and  .

 Gorai Machchimar Sahakari Sanstha has sought permission from   (MMB) to operate houseboats in the creeks along Mumbai’s coast.
 
 MMB has received a total of 11 proposals from coastal districts to set up houseboats. “Like in Kerala, we want to promote houseboats in the backwaters of Maharashtra too. Houseboats already operate at Tarkarli in Sindhudurg district and are a big hit with tourists,” said a senior MMB official. A houseboat can accommodate two families at a time.
 
 “We will levy a 10% charge on what the operator charges each tourist. Besides, there will be a security deposit. The details will be worked out over the next couple of weeks,” said the officials.
 
 Neville D'Souza, secretary, Gorai Machchimar Sahakari Sanstha, said the state has proposed several schemes to promote tourism in the area. “We decided to implement the scheme ourselves instead of letting outsiders benefit from it. Also, we will ensure the scheme is implemented in an environmentally friendly way. We will take tourists through the creeks and show them mangroves.”
 
 Along with houseboats, MMB will also launch water   facilities in the next few months at Juhu, Versova, Aksa,  ,  , Gorai, Ghodbunder, Bhayandar and Vasai. This is the first time that these facilities are being introduced in Mumbai   and  . 
 
 “This year, we have received 65 applications from six districts,” said the official. The facilities include kayaking, banana rides, water scooters and speed boats. The operator will be charged Rs 10,000 per boat a year and a security deposit of similar amount.
