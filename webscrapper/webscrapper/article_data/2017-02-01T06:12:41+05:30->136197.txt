KOCHI: Though doctors in private hospitals in the state have been asking patients to go for pneumonia vaccines, they are not popular yet. As the vaccine has not been introduced in the government sector, not many has opted it since the cost is a huge concern.

 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) provides protection against different bacterial sub-types of pneumonia, a disease that infects the lungs. The cost of the vaccine varies between Rs 13,000 and Rs 14,000, making it the costliest vaccine in the immunization schedule of a child. The child needs at least three primary doses to get   and few doctors advise the fourth dose after 16 months.
 
 “Many find the vaccination expensive, but when you compare it with the cost of hospitalisation for pneumonia and the number of days spent by the child in the hospital, it is not much. There are some parents who ask me, whether they should opt for chicken pox vaccine or PCV and I ask them to go for the later, as pneumonia is more dangerous in children,“ said Dr   , former president of India Academy of Pediatrics. He said that due to overuse, misuse and abuse of antibiotics they are now coming across cases of drug resistance.Paediatricians said that it is often difficult to confirm   cases. “We do get cases of pneumonia and partially treated meningitis where patients do not respond to standard treatments. But the tests to confirm IPD are expensive and it is difficult to tell how many of these cases are confirmed,“ observed Dr Tonny Mampilly, neonatal and paediatric medicine,  
 
 Dr M  , president of the Kochi chapter of IMA and a paediatrician, said no exhaustive study has been done in Kerala to understand the IPD prevalence. “But with PCV available in market since last 5 to 6 years, I believe the incidence of IPD has come down,“ said Dr Narayanan.
