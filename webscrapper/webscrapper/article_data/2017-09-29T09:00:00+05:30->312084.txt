Ahmedabad: A healthy and athletic Abhay Singh didn’t have any past history of high cholesterol or high blood pressure or any family history, and yet suffered his first heart attack in 2001 when he was 29-year-old. Later, Singh, a chain smoker and an occasional drinker, suffered heart attacks twice in the next three years, leading to cardiac muscle damage. As the only remedy left for him was to go for the heart transplant, he underwent the surgery a year ago and now he is living a healthy life. 

 A marketing professional, Singh had been leading an erratic and unhealthy lifestyle. After two attacks, his heart muscles had started weakening and he was put on a strict medication protocol. Unfortunately, his heart muscles got damaged significantly after the third attack. He had been experiencing typical symptoms like shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and constant dizziness, as by now his heart was unable to effectively pump blood across his body. In August 2016, Singh (46 now) underwent heart transplant surgery in Chennai and since then he has been living a healthy life, but with precautions like avoiding crowded place and infections. “After the third attack, heart efficiency dropped considerably and it started affecting other organs. Water started getting accumulated in the body as the heart was not pumping effectively,” said Singh. “I then applied for heart transplantation and waited for five months to get the transplant done at a Chennai-based hospital because there was no such facility in Gujarat then.” 
 
 Dr Keyur Parikh, senior cardiologist at a city-based hospital, said, “Singh was kept under close observation post transplantation. He is on lifelong medication to ensure that his new heart is accepted by his body and does not suffer any damage.”
