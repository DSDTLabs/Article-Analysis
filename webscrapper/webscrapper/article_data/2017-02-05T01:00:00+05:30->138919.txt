 is keen that a slice of his upcoming film, 'The Ghazi Attack', remains with him. The movie is based on true events from the 1971 war, when Pakistani submarine Ghazi (Asia’s most powerful fast-attack submarine at that time) attempted to destroy the Indian aircraft carrier, INS  . 

 When the actor got to know that a major manufacturer has made a bike using metal sourced from INS Vikrant, he expressed a desire to buy it. A bike lover, what made this two-wheeler even more special for Rana is its connection with the country’s first aircraft carrier. The film will see him playing Naval officer Lieutenant Commander  , who is said to have remained underwater for 18 days during the war. Rana met many naval officers, especially those on board the ship, while preparing for the role.
