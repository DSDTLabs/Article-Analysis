PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A new bridge constructed over the   river near   on Pune-Bengaluru highway has no retaining wall. 

 While the service road passing from the bridge is partially closed, some two-wheeler riders tend to veer off the main road to the service road and may fall into the river below.
 
 The 140-km stretch of Pune-Satara highway (a part of Pune-Bengaluru highway) is being widened from four lanes to six lanes. Various works such as construction of new bridges, subways, and widening of existing subways are in progress on the highway stretch. A contractor, appointed by the  , is constructing these works. 
 
 On the new Ravet bridge, parallel to the main bridge, only a small drum has been put up at the start of the service road to prevent vehicles from using the road. 
 
 While many vehicle owners use the main road, it is observed that some two-wheeler riders travel on the service road and could meet with an accident. 
 
  officials said they have issued instructions to the contractor to close the service road. The completion of six-laning of the highway has been delayed. The contractor started work in March 2010 and the works were to be completed before March 2013. 
 
 However, the contractor has said that the work could not be completed because of land acquisition issues. The contractor has already got two extensions. 
 
 Four advertisement professionals had lost their lives on November 2, 2013 when their car plunged into the   near Shirval. 
 
 There was a 15-ft gap between the two bridges. The gap has now been barricaded by the contractor.
