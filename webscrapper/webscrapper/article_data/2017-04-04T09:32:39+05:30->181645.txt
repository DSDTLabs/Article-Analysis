JAIPUR: The   (NIA) on Monday submitted the closure report in the   Dargah blast case before a special court in Jaipur. The agency said that they had not found sufficient evidence to prosecute four suspects-Indresh Kumar,  , Rajendra alias Samandar and Prince-in the 2007   conspiracy case. Earlier, on March 22, the court had questioned the clean chit given by   to the four and asked the agency to either file a closure report on the clean chit or file a chargesheet against the suspects. 

 On Monday, NIA told the court that it couldn't corroborate the involvement of the four. The court has reserved its verdict on the report till April 17. Three people were killed in the Ajmer blast of October 11, 2007. "The NIA didn't find sufficient evidence against the four and, hence, filed the closure report on Monday," said special public prosecutor Ashwini Kumar. The special NIA court of Dinesh Kumar Gupta expressed its displeasure over the pace of investigation as the agency had failed to arrest absconders-Suresh Nair, Ramchandra Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange.
