The Nagpur Division of South East Central Railway (SECR) became the first in the zone to introduce a portable aluminium ramp facility for senior citizens, ailing and handicapped passengers, at Itwari railway station on Wednesday. The new facility will ensure passengers are shifted directly into the coach as against only the entry point earlier. Senior divisional commercial manager Arjun Sibal said, “The ramp is light weight and can be carried by one person. It costs Rs10,000 only. The design is a prototype of European and Japanese ramps, but has been customized locally.” SECR plans to introduce the ramp at 8 stations. It will be available along with the wheelchair and a staff. There are plans to further modify the design. Requests can be on 0712-2766058 or 0712-2764324.
