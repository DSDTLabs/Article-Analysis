 Preliminary probe revealed that Deepuraj would trawl job portals and professional networking sites to access contact details of women who aspired to work for international airlines as client relationship managers. He posed as vice-president (corporate HR) and reached out to aspirants, stating they had been shortlisted by an international carrier for a five-round interview which included two rounds of video-based physical examination and a fitness test.
 
 During the video call, he reportedly told the women to pose in different angles and video-recorded the interview. Subsequently, he would get in touch with the aspirant and coerce her to have a sex chat with him. If she refused, he would blackmail her by threatening to upload her video online.
 
 Cops said he targeted women job-seekers from other fields too. “Prima facie, his motive seems to be voyeuristic pleasure. We are yet to ascertain how many girls he has conned and if there’s any financial angle,” a police officer said on Wednesday. He was produced before the magistrate and remanded to judicial custody.
