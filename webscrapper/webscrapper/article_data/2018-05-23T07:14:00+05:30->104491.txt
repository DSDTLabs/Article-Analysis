GURUGRAM: Residents of   69 and 70 have complained that work on a 60-metre wide sector road, which had been on the cards for the past three years, was halted a month ago.

 According to residents, the road is only half built and has heaps of earth lying on it at many places, adding to the pollution problem. Recently, strong winds struck these mounds and blew dust into many apartments in the area, affecting residents of Tulip White, GPL Eden Heights and other societies. 
 
 Residents told TOI that the work on the road was left unfinished and there were no signs that it would be resumed soon.
 
 “There were no roads that linked us with the SPR,” said  , a resident of Sector 69. “This was just a muddy place. We had to travel all the way to   to reach Gurugram city. We made many requests with the authorities after which the work on the road was recently started.”
 
 Residents said that the construction of the road started last year. “The construction came to a halt a few months ago because eight towers of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam were coming in its way. The towers could not be removed and there was a deadlock. But after some deliberations, authorities decided to go ahead with the work anyway,” said  , another resident.
 
 However, over a month ago, authorities again halted work without notifying residents. “Since then, our problems have only worsened,” Mukherjee said. “They built half of the road but a 400-metre stretch was left unfinished. It has huge mounds of earth, which had been dug out, lying on it without any cover. The dust from the road enters our houses. Additionally, there are craters on the road which makes it difficult to drive or walk on it.”
 
  sources have told TOI that the patch of road residents are talking about is under litigation. “Work was started with the hope that the issue would be resolved by the time we reached that stretch but that has not been the case and this will take some time,” said officials.
