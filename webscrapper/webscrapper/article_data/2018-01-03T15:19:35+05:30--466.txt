NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s PWD has started the repair work at   flyover. PWD officials say the work will be carried out in two phases and will be completed by January  .

 PWD officials said that six expansion joints have to be changed in each carriageway along with routine maintenance of bearings. “For this, we will have to lift the sections of the flyover by providing support under it. During this period, vehicular movement is not possible. We will complete the work on one carriageway in 15 days,” said a senior PWD official.
 
 In the first phase, the carriageway from Ashram Chowk to Moolchand will be closed till January 14. Moolchand-bound traffic will have to take the adjoining road beneath the flyover during this period, a traffic official said.
 
 In the second phase, the carriageway from Moolchand to Ashram Chowk will be closed. Traffic officials say that peole should take alternate routes like Mathura road, Ashram chowk, Ring Road, Moolchand flyover/Lodhi Road, Bhishm Pitamah Road while commuting between south and central Delhi. 
 
 The traffic coming from Noida via DND flyway can take Barapullah elevated road to reach south and central Delhi.PWD officials said that they got the permission from traffic police to start the work on Monday and the work will be completed in a timebound manner.
 
 In April last year, PWD had carried out the repair of Defence Colony  . Though the entire work was to be completed by June, it got delayed by two months. Though the flyover was partially open for traffic, both the carriageways were reopened for public in September. According to an estimate, over three lakh vehicles cross the stretch between DND and Lajpat Nagar daily.
