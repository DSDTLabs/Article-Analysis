Q: What do you have to say about development works carried out in the past five years in SBS Nagar?

 A: Though the ward was under Ludhiana Improvement Trust, I have arranged everything for this locality through MC at my level. We got the roads constructed. We even arranged sweepers for SBS Nagar with the help of MC as the LIT did not have permanent sweepers. Moreover, A2Z waste management firm had been involved in garbage lifting.
 
 Q: What about the claims of residents that roads are in pathetic condition?
 
 A: The roads were constructed some time ago and even now I had got the agenda approved through LIT, but in between the assembly elections came and election code was imposed. Followed by this, the government changed and now Congress leaders do not let leaders from other parties to get their works done in the localities.
 
 Q: What according to you remained the major issue that crippled development of this locality?
 
 A: The only problem was the fact that area comes under LIT. I had tried to bring this area under MC and general house had approved the resolution as well, but then LIT got it dropped. The LIT does not have enough infrastructure to maintain the necessary basic amenities in the localities and this is the reason the areas under LIT remain in bad shape.
