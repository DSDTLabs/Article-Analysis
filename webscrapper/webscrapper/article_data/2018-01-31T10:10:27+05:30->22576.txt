CHANDIGARH:   said on Tuesday that his ministry would consider extending the terms of Chandigarh’s mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, from a year to five years. 

 He also hinted at introducing direct elections to the three posts to strengthen the civic body’s authority. At present, councillors vote for electing those who hold the three posts. The minister’s statement came in reply to a question by   councillors, during a closed-door meeting at the UT Guest House. “One-year mayor term is too short to understand the system. It takes a couple of months to even learn the basics. I agree there should be a five-year term for mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. We will consider it. Direct elections to the three posts are also crucial. Delhi has the same issue. I feel the same thing should be happen in Delhi too,” Rajnath told councillors and BJP leaders while discussing the issue.
 
 Sources in the BJP said direct   will benefit the city. “The home minster showed the keen interest in increasing the mayoral terms and holding direct elections to the three posts. He agreed to our plea that nothing can be done in a year’s tenure. We are hopeful the central will reach a decision on this very soon,” said a senior BJP leader.
 
 Some BJP councillors also raised the issue of a criminal case registered against former mayor   and other BJP leaders for going to orphanage Snehalaya, Maloya, last year. The BJP leaders demanded action against the officer concerned.
