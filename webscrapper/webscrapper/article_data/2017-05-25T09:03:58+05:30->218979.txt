PUNE: Experts and citizens hailed chief minister Devendra Fadnavisâ€™ suggestion of setting up integrated transport hubs in busy   and   areas to ease traffic movement and ensure commuters get public vehicles without any hassle.

 The Swargate and Shivjinagar are among the busiest areas with the presence of ST terminus, bus stand of   (PMPML), flyovers, underpasses and Bus Rapid Transit route. 
 
 Regular commuters stressed the present situation in both the areas was completely chaotic and not people-friendly. Haphazard development of transport utilities over the years led to gross mismanagement, they felt.
 
 Ramesh Shah, a regular traveller said chaos could go up in the near future with the addition of metro and mono rails. With limited space for expansion, there is a need to integrate transport utilities to avoid confusion among travellers.
 
 Pranjali Deshpande-Agashe, the state programme manager of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, said the safety of pedestrians and travellers was at stake because of non-planned development at Swargate and Shivajinagar. People are left confused after they get down from ST and PMPML buses at Swargate. She said there were no dedicated walkways for them to reach to bus stands and integrated approach would help deal with the issues.
