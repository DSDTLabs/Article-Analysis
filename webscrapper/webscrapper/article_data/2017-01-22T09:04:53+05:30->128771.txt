GANDHINAGAR: The   (RSS) cancelled a media interaction with its top brass scheduled for Sunday after the statements about the reservation system—which could be politically damaging for the BJP—by  , the akhil Bharatiya prachar pramukh of the organization at the Jaipur Literature Festival while elections in UP, Punjab, Goa and two other states are at hand.

 Vaidya and other RSS leaders came to Ahmedabad on Saturday for a three-day workshop of the RSS media cell, to discuss national media communication issues and strategy.
 
 The RSS had planned the media interaction on Sunday, but after the blunder by Vaidya, decided to cancel the media interaction to avoid any further controversy. 
 
 RSS’s sahsarsanghchalak   also attended the workshop. Both the leaders, however, avoided the local media. The RSS’s Gujarat unit also tried to do damage control on Vaidya’s statement.
 
 The RSS’s local unit, in a press statement, said: “Vaidya clearly said RSS supports reservation for backward class communities from SC, ST and   and never opposed it. 
 
 Reservation on the basis of religion is not as per the constitution. Reservation on the basis of religion promotes separatism in the country. RSS is against reservation on the basis on religion only.”
