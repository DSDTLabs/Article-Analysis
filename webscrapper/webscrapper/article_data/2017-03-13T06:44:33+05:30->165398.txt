HYDERABAD: Just a few days after the Hyderabad Metropolitan   (HMWS&SB) announced that the city will not face any water crisis this summer, the   officials have received an alert from the engineer-in-chief (E-in-C) of the irrigation and catchment area development (I&CAD) to make necessary arrangements to install emergency pumps at   in   district. 

 The water board has been drawing raw Krishna water from Puttamgandi (for lifting water from Nagarjunasagar), around 130km away from the city, for supplying 270 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to the city. Based on the I&CAD directive in 2016, the water board had installed 10 emergency pump sets by spending 10 crore. 
 
 "As the   ( ) has decided to allot Krishna water to both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for irrigation purpose, the irrigation department has directed us to install emergency pumps at Puttamgandi. The I&CAD has specifically said water can be drawn till levels reach 500 feet. The present water level in Nagarjunasagar is 512 feet," HMWS&SB director-technical P S Suryanarayana told TOI. 
 
 "In a letter, sent to the HMWS&SB, the I&CAD said that the installation of pump sets has to be completed by April-end. We will invite tenders in a day or two to supply and fit the emergency pump sets at Puttamgandi. By April 15, we will complete installation and keep them ready for pumping Krishna water. Once installed, a trail run will be conducted for two days," he said. The water board had installed emergency pump sets for the first time in 2005.
 
 "If the monsoon gets delayed, we can draw water from Nagarjunasagar till 490 feet too, but it again depends on the irrigation department's instructions," the official said. On power consumption charges, the official said, "We had received nearly 3 lakh per day in 2016. We had used 10 pump sets for two months to draw water last year."
