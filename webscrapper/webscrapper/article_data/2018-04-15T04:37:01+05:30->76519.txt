MUMBAI: Civic authorities have given the green signal to repair the MRI machine at civic-run   that has been nonfunctional since January 27 when a   resident got drawn into its magnetic field and died. 

 "The additional municipal commissioner has approved a proposal to repair the MRI machine within a budget of Rs 5 crore,'' Nair Hospital dean Dr   told TOI on Saturday. As per BMC procedure, the proposal will be come up before the standing committee next week for final approval. 
 
 While the hospital was keen on a new MRI machine, the costs are almost double and it would take much longer to fix and get operational, said Dr Bharmal. "We need a working machine at the earliest for patients,'' he said.
 
 On Friday, BMC released a preliminary investigation report into the mishap and held a ward boy and ayah for negligence that resulted in the 32-year-old textile salesman's death.
 
 On Saturday, his brother-in-law,  , told TOI that the family had received compensation of Rs 5 lakh from the state government and another Rs 1 lakh from the local MLA.
