NEW DELHI: The defence ministry has withdrawn a controversial order that downgraded the military officers in comparison with their counterparts in the   (AFHQ)  , which had caused a lot of heartburn over the entire issue of rank equivalence in the armed forces. 

 The defence ministry letter issued on October 18, 2016, had equated a Major General (Rear Admiral in   and   in IAF) with a principal director in AFHQ Civil Service. Similarly, a Brigadier (Commodore/Air Commodore) with 25-26 years of service was made equivalent to a director (with about 14 years of service), and a Colonel/Captain/Group Captain to a joint director in the civil service. 
 
 The order had led to widespread anger in the armed forces, who for long have contended that the bureaucracy has worked over the years to systematically downgrade their status, rank and pay. After facing protests, the defence ministry had stated that the rank parity issue would be “studied from all angles” to ensure “no false equivalence was created or allowed”. 
 
 On Friday, a defence ministry official said, “The letter of October 2016 on the issue of equivalence between armed forces officers and AFHQ Civil Service has been withdrawn with immediate effect on the orders of defence minister  .”
