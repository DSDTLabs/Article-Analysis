PUNE: Daily traffic congestion around ‘Wipro circle’ in Hinjewadi Phase II is set to be mitigated by next week. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has begun to reduce the diameter of the roundabout, to make space for an extra traffic lane. 

 The diameter at present is 40 feet and is set to be trimmed by half. The   had started the work on removing the soil and other fixtures inside the roundabout. The central installation, branding of the company which maintains the green cover on the circle will be retained.
 
 The work is set to be finished by this weekend. An official request in this regard was submitted by the   to MIDC and the head of the traffic branch around mid-July.
 
 The circle has been a fixture at IT Park for many years. It connects Phases II and III, and is a major transit point for thousands working in Hinjewadi. It is also at the mouth of the Infosys bus bay. Several buses navigate around the roundabout daily. The volume of traffic, combined with pedestrians and those getting off and on buses makes it prone to snarls in peak hours. On bad days, bumper-to-bumper traffic stretches over 1.5 kms on the Phase III road. IT professionals have demanded complete removal of the circle. 
 
 Techie Sudhir Deshmukh who has been fighting to decongest the IT Park through the ‘Free up Hinjewadi’ campaign, welcomes the move to   the circle. “On an average, I spend 40 minutes daily at  . Reducing the diameter of the circle will create one more lane for traffic, which should help to clear vehicles faster,” he said.
 
 The traffic division of Hinjewadi, however, has expressed scepticism. D A Patil, police inspector in charge of the division, said, “This is only going to shift the burden to adjoining roads which are not wide enough to clear out traffic any faster than they do now.”
