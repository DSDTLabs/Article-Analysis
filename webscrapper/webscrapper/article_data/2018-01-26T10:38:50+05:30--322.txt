SURAT: A 25-year-old man was convicted of raping a four-year-old girl and sentenced to 14-year imprisonment by a court on Thursday. Krishna Vilas  ,  , had raped the minor in   village in May 2013.

 On May 28, 2013, the girl’s mother, who stitches clothes at home, had gone out to buy threads from a shop near her house. The girl and her younger brother were alone at home. 
 
 Aaishi, who lived on the second floor of the same building as the girl’s family, noticed that the kids were alone. Taking advantage of the situation, he took the girl to his room and raped her.
 
 When her mother returned home in few minutes, she did not find her and started inquiring with neighbours. One of them informed her that he noticed her with a man wearing ring in his ear. She immediately identified the person from the description and directly went to Aaishi’s room. She found her daughter crying in the room and brought her home.
 
 She later noticed that the minor had suffered injuries in the private parts. Suspecting that she was sexually assaulted, she contacted her husband over phone and called him. Aaishi was then nabbed by the family and neighbours and thrashed before being handed over to police.
 
 Aaishi was also slapped with a Rs 40,000 fine.
