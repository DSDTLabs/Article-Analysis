 Malik’s character Ammaji, which was the central character of the show, was bumped off within three months in the second season and now five months later, the show is set to go off air owing to poor ratings. Meghna says, “In my tweet, I compared the show’s wrapping up to the sinking of the Titanic because it was with the beautiful imagination, creativity and hard work of the previous team that a show like   was created. Each one of us on the previous team had lent our body, heart and soul to the show. Today, it pains my heart that an iconic character like   and a popular show like Laado was tarnished by the writers in the second season. It is unfortunate that they could not understand the audience’s pulse or of the characters in the second season.”

 Meghna says she wasn’t aware that her track would barely last for three months. “When I was signed up to do the show, Ammaji was the central character, torch bearer and crusader of the show. And the fact that she would be bumped off within three months, was not known to me, but other co-actors knew of it, as I gather now. The least I expected was transparency from the team. In the second season, the audiences were expecting Ammaji to be exactly the way she was portrayed in the promos. The promo built up the expectation of the audiences, who waited for Ammaji to emerge even stronger than before. But what was shown to them was a weak-kneed, breathless woman, which disappointed the viewers. Therefore, though I signed up to play Ammaji, I never felt I was shooting for the show or playing the part. I only enjoyed shooting the promo.”
 
 It’s not about the ratings for her, she avers. “Actors like us have never worked for ratings. We only understand viewer connect. I wish the same was understood by the writers.”
