The hospital drew flak after the video showed the ward boy, Babu, transporting the baby in his arms with a relative carrying an oxygen cylinder in tow. 

 Speaking to reporters, superintendent of the hospital, Dr Ramesh Reddy, said, "We made enquiries and checked with officials and staff. Nobody asked Babu to carry the child when stretchers were available. So we have sacked him."
 
 Sources said, Babu in his defence told   officials he was driven by compassion and exigency to help the sick toddler as stretchers were not available then. Hospital authorities, however, dismissed his claim as lies. "The decision was not unilateral. We acted after checking facts," said Reddy.
