Chennai: Around 70 truckloads of   arrived at Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai early on Friday morning, a day before the beginning of the Pongal festival.

 Wholesalers expect at least 300 truckloads of sugarcane to arrive by Sunday to mark the harvest festival.
 
 Owing to good yield, the cost of sugarcane this year is low, with one bundle costing around Rs 300. 
 
 A bundle from Theni, which is considered to be of high quality, costs Rs 500. The prices are 20% less than those last year, say wholesale dealers. A bundle consists of 50 canes. 
 
 “Each cane will cost between Rs 15 and Rs 20,” said V R Soundararajan, Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor. The yield was thin in the last two years due to the deluge in some districts in 2015 and the drought the following year, he said.
 
 Most of the sugarcane produce that reachers Chennai are sourced from pockets in Thanjavur, Panruti in Cuddalore and villages in Madurai and Theni.
 
 In addition to sugrcane, around 50 small trucks carrying turmeric also arrived in Koyambedu market ahead of the festival.
