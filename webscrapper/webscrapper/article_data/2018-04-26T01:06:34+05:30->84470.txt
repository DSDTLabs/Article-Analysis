Coimbatore: The city Crime Branch sleuths on Wednesday arrested an employee of a cash replenishment firm for siphoning off as many as Rs 7.34 lakh over a period of time from the cash to be filled in the automated teller machines (ATMs) across Ramanathapuram in the city.

 M Suresh Kumar, 32, of Sowripalayam, was taken into custody based on a complaint lodged by the cash replenishment company.
 
 The fraud came to light while setting accounts at the end of the financial year, when banks noticed anomalies in the amount handled in the ATMs and the amount dispensed from their currency chest, said an investigation officer.
 
 After several banks submitted reports in this regard, the company conducted an internal inquiry and found that the money went missing only from the ATMs handled by Suresh Kumar.
 
 Suresh stole a total of Rs 7.34 lakh between November 20, 2017, and February 10, 2018. “He used to steal money while filling the ATMs and also from ATM lockers,” the official said.
 
 The cash replenishment firm then lodged a police compliant against Suresh Kumar. The police registered a case under Section 408 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and arrested Suresh Kumar.
 
 He was later produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody for 15 days. Following this, Suresh Kumar was lodged at the Coimbatore Central Prison.
 
 Further investigations are on.
