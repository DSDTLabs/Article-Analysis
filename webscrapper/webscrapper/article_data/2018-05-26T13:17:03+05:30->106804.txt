CHANDIGARH: Honeypreet Insan, the alleged adopted daughter of rape convict   chief Gurmeet   Singh, is among the inmates of   jail who have enrolled in courses of dress designing, block printing and beauty tips. 

 
 Honeypreet, whose actual name is Priyanka Taneja, has been lodged in the Ambala jail since October 2017 for allegedly conspiring to spread violence after the dera head was convicted by a CBI court in Panchkula on August 25, 2017, for raping two sadhvis (disciples).
 
 An Ambala-based skill development institute is offering the course under the supervision of Ambala district legal services authority (DSLA).
 
 Haryana inspector general (jails) Jagjeet Singh said such activities were organized throughout the year. “Our priority is to train convicts who are expected to complete their term. We allow undertrials (Honeypreet is one) to be enrolled based on availability of seats,” he said. He confirmed Honeypreet was enrolled in the three courses.
 
 Honeypreet essayed the female lead along with Ram Rahim in movies produced and directed by him, like ‘MSG: Messenger of God’ and ‘MSG-II’. She often appeared in designer clothes on the screen. Even on regular days, Honeypreet liked to dress up.
 
 She was named as the main conspirator of the violence, which broke out minutes after the court convicted Ram Rahim of rape on August 25. Honeypreet is reported to have chaired the meeting of the core committee in which she directed top officials of the dera to spread violence in case there was a conviction.
 
 According to information, she has been kept in a different cell and attends courses with inmates attached with her.
