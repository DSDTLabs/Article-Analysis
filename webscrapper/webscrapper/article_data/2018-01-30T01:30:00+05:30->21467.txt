Hyderabad: Setting an example of big corporates partnering with the startup ecosystem to find solutions for their problems, Copenhagen-headquartered brewer   Group has reached out to the Telangana government and evinced interest in partnering with the government-backed incubator T-Hub to devise innovative ways of reducing its water usage.

 “The CEO of Carlsberg (Cees ‘t Hart) at a meeting at WEF said they have a problem and asked if we could help him find a solution. He said that right now, if they have to produce 1 litre of beer, they have to use 3.8 litres of water, which they would ideally like to bring it down to 2 litres but for now if they are even able to bring it down to 3 litres, it will be a substantial achievement and will help conserve water,” Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao said at an event at T-Hub on Monday .Industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan pointed out that Carlsberg already has a bottling unit in the state and its senior officials are likely to visit T-Hub soon to discuss the agenda in detail. According to data revealed by the Union ministry of health last year, Telangana stands at the top among all the southern states when it comes to consumption of alcohol with 53.9% of men and 8.8% of women consuming alcohol.
