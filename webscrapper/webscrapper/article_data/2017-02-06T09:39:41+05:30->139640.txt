NEW DELHI: With barely a few days left for the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh, the   brass has hit the campaign trail, keeping surgical strikes and demonetisation at the centrestage to showcase the Modi government’s resolve to take on terror and corruption.

 The two issues have resonated in most of the rallies involving prominent leaders with PM   terming surgical strikes a measure to boost the morale of the armed forces while describing demonetisation as a war on corruption. 
  in Meerut on Saturday and Aligarh on Sunday, BJP chief   was in Mathura and Amroha while home minister   was out campaigning in nearby Agra.
 
 Modi’s mention of 
  evoked maximum response, vindicating the ruling party’s perception that along with demonetisation, it has gone down well with the common man. Even while unveiling the party manifesto recently, Shah had listed these two as major “achievements” of the Modi government.
 
 Rajnath Singh has been equally vocal about these issues, though he has been 
  on terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In a TV interview, Singh said he could not rule out more surgical strikes in future, signalling the government resolve against terrorists.
 
 BJP insiders said defence minister Manohar Parrikar will amplify surgical strikes as one of the milestones in Indian history as he is set to join the campaign after polling got over in Goa. Meanwhile, even though Modi has been the biggest crowd puller, his rallies in UP have been scaled down significantly allowing more space for other leaders, including those from the state.
 
 Party managers have assigned local leaders for ‘nukkad’ rallies to develop a direct connect with voters.
 
 Modi will address three-four rallies in each of the seven phases of polling in the state. He will address three more rallies, including one in Agra, before the first phase of polling on February 11.
