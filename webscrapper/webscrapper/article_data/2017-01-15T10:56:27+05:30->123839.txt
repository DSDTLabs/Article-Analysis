In the auspicious morning of  , even as her relatives WhatsApped sketches of pots of boiling rice, one hungry Tamilian sat in a McDonald’s outlet and replied with photos of Dosa Masala Brioche. Her irreparably South Indian stomach was ready to attack this newest attempt at localisation, all guns blazing and loaded with Tamil gunpowder. After all, this was an abdomen that — after spending eight days in Australia — had induced tears of joy on getting idli sambar on the flight back from Singapore. It was also the same juvenile core that had laughed when the evil Rice Plate Reddy from the 2009 film,  , invented a fast-food perversion called the ‘McDosa’ whose tagline was a subtle: ‘Eat my dosa or die’.  ,  ,   — this tummy had self-righteously junked many obscenities of fusion in the past so this latest cross-breeding should have been an easy target. Sadly, the   turned out to be a happy meal.

 For one, not only did the dish help our ignorant friend discover that ‘Brioche’ was a French pastry but also that the 'e' in Brioche, just as the ‘t’ in Filet, was silent. Secondly, she realised that the word ‘Dosa’ should probably be silent too. Inside the Brioche, there is no hint of dosa, only a crisp, iPhone-sleek patty of the potato masala that Udupi hotels notoriously love to skimp on. At Rs 42-a-piece, this patty burger is definitely cheaper than a masala dosa.
 
 With green peas, jeera, dal, mustard, onion and even pieces of curry leaves, this happy patty tasted surprisingly authentic. But it was really the molaga-podi-infused mayonnaise that seemed to give the invention its endearingly subversive feel — as if someone were slyly hanging lungis over a fence built by Trump. As she washed it down with filter coffee, the outlet manager told her that people were already liking the invention. He then handed her a feedback form for the dish. And all she could come up with was: "More gunpowder please."
