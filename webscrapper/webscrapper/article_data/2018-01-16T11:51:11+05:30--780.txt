Chandrapur: Bhadrawati police have arrested two persons from village   for repeatedly raping three minor girls. Parents of the victim girls filed a complaint on Sunday after one of the girls disclosed the regular exploitation to her father.

 The arrested accused have been identified as   (50) and   (20). Police sources claimed that Pimple raped two 11-year-old girls.   also raped these two girls, and another 10-year-old girl.

 Visapur is a small village of around 50 houses. The children go to a playground in the school premises to play after school hours too. The three girls were playing in the school premises around eight days back, when accused Hanwate lured one of the girls to the toilet and exploited her sexually. Then he took the other two girls also and exploited them similarly.
 
 Pimple learnt about Hanwateâ€™s act and he too took the two elder girls to the same school toilet and exploited them on subsequent days.
 
 Following repeated sexual harassment, one of the girls developed severe pain in her abdomen. After she complained to her father about the pain, the matter came to light. She also said that two other girls had also been harassed in similar fashion. After a complaint by the parents, the two accused were rounded up the same night.
 
 PSO   informed that the accused lived behind the school and frequented the empty school building to enjoy gutkha and kharra. Seeing the three girls alone, they took advantage of them. He said that the accused were presented before the sessions court at   on Monday and remanded to magisterial custody remand.
