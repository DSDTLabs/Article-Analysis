VADODARA:   at the   (BCA) is expected to improve in the coming months. 

 The association has decided to train the   and ensure that their skills are upgraded. The decision was taken during the umpires committee meeting that was organized after a gap of two years. Three members of this committee had alleged some days ago that BCA management was compromising with the umpiring standards. 
 
 “The management dominated by the Revival Group was allotting matches to only a select set of umpires who supported their group. Quality umpires were ignored and that affected umpiring standards at the BCA. We raised the issue during the umpires committee meeting and the members of the Revival Group accepted that there was bias in allotting matches to some umpires,” said Kalyan Haribhakti, member of the umpires committee. 
 
 “We were assured that from now on cricket matches will be allotted to all the qualified umpires. They asked us to forget the past. It was a positive meeting,” Haribhakti, who supports the Royal Group, told TOI. He added that now the umpires will be given coaching about their field. They will also appear for exams and grades will be given according to their performance.
 
 Haribhakti and two others had also objected to the co-opting of two new members in the umpires committee. He had alleged that the Revival Group wants majority in the committee to take decisions as per its will. “We raised the issue following which we were told that the BCA managing committee had taken the decision and it is legal. So we accepted it,” Haribhakti said. 
 
 Suhas Sapre and Manoj Kadakiya to the umpires committee have been co-opted in the committee. “They wanted to have co-opted member as umpire’s committee chairman but we objected to it. They agreed to appoint Amit Joshi as the chairman after managing committee ratifies the decision,” he added.
