BENGALURU: Forty-six days after the vicious attack on him, Lokayukta Justice   returned to office on Monday morning. But he chose a new spot to sit, away from where he was attacked, possibly to distance himself from memories of the incident that almost cost him his life.

 The attack took place on March 7 when Tejas Sharma, a petitioner, barged into Shetty’s office chamber and knifed him. He was caught by security personnel, while the Lokayukta was rushed to Mallya Hospital with stab wounds.
 
 The judge termed the attack ‘unfortunate’ and said he wanted to forget the episode and continue his work.
 
 Sources said Shetty opted to move his seat from the old location in his room where he was attacked and sit on the opposite side. His subordinate, the registrar, chose to sit near a large TV screen to monitor visitor movements through   cameras. 
 
 Shetty’s office will implement a new system, wherein every visitor will be issued a black-and-white temporary photo entry card with identity details of the person. The security procedure is likely to come into place within a few weeks, sources said.
