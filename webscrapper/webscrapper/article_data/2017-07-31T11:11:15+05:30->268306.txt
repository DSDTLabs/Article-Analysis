THRISSUR: Kerala state commission for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes chairman Justice P N   on Sunday visited the house of Vinayak, the 19-year-old dalit youth, who committed suicide after being taken into custody by the Pavaratty police. He was accompanied by Thrissur district collector A Kowsigan, Chavakkad tahsildar K V Ambrose, and rural SP N Vijayakumar.

 The commission chairman, who reached the house of   around 11am, met the deceased boy’s father, mother and only brother, who has returned from the Gulf. Vijayakumar said that he had directed the police chief that the investigation into the case must always be scrutinized by a legal expert. “In many serious crimes, culprits get acquitted because police won’t get correct legal advice during investigation.”
 
 Vijayakumar said he will immediately recommend the state government to appoint a special public prosecutor for the case. “As the government has already ordered investigation by a special agency, the commission will also watch the progress of the investigation. 
 
 The commission has also directed the district scheduled castes officer to release the monetary help to the family of the victim, as directed in Schedule 2 of the SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act,” he added.
 
 Justice Vijayakumar also visited Vinayak’s grave at his ancestral house. Minister for SC/ST welfare  , who was supposed to visit the house of Vinayak on Sunday, postponed his visit to Monday due to hartal.
