NEW DELHI: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party leader   on Friday took on the   government on law and order issues in the state that have been grabbing headlines lately. “Hum to badnaam thhey (our government was the one which earned a bad name for it), but why did this government discontinue some of the good things that our government had done like getting the police to arrive promptly on dialing 100 on the phone, or posting police personnel on the highways?”, Akhilesh wondered. 

 The SP leader was asked about the   as well as reports of dacoities, killings and rapes that are being reported from the state over the last few weeks, on the sidelines of the luncheon meeting of opposition parties to decide on the presidential elections, hosted by Congress president  . Asked if he or any of his party leaders have visited the villages where the tensions prevailed following clashes, Yadav said, “The question is not about who visited the places, the question that should be asked is why are these incidents happening”.
