HYDERABAD: With heavy showers lashing the city, the air around the   ( ) was filled with an acrid stench and the lake began frothing once again.

 On Wednesday, the road running parallel to the railway track, under the RK Puram flyover, was reeking of foul smell. That's not all, even the weir which feeds into the lake, was filled to the brim with white froth, which under the influence of the wind was flying into the air, and into the  , adjacent to it.
 
 Residents of the area who have been for long complaining about the deteriorating health of the lake rued how the foam had started to spill onto the roads now.
 
 “It was fine until a few days ago. But now, after the incessant rains it has begun frothing over once again. The bund is 12 feet tall, so if the foam is crossing this and spreading onto the road, this could prove deadly for the 2,000-odd residents living in this area,“ said D Prem Raj, a resident of the area.
 
 Some residents, like   and Laxmaiah, also lashed out at the Telangana State Pollution Control Booard (TSPCB) for turning a blind eye to their concerns.They rued how despite officials of the board visiting the lake twice and even collecting samples, they have taken no measures to put an end to the foaming issue.
 
 “The froth has begun flying into the air, and is now entering the Rythu Bazaar next to it. This is extremely harmful and can lead to serious repercussions. The pollution control board officials must soon check and find out if the produce in the market has been contaminated by the foam or not,“ said Laxmaiah, a resident of Sainik Nagar.
