CHENNAI: When   first picked up a camera several years ago, the engineer looked at it as nothing more than a   that his mathematical mind could toy with.
Today, the camera has turned from a mere gadget to his palette, with which Chari creates `photo-paintings' -quite literally photographs that look like abstracts in watercolour.
 
 Chari, who is currently exhibiting the photo series “Beyonder“ at the Eyemage Gallery on  , says it took him more than two years to capture his 'paintings' of the   and the  .
 
 “The theme I was looking for in this series was land and sky ,“ says the 40-year-old photographer, who has earlier exhibited his street life photo portraits at the Photo Biennale in Chennai last year. “It was always my dream to be a painter, but I was not very good at it. Until I realised I could use my camera as a brush.“
 
 He chanced on his technique one evening on his terrace when, at sundown, he focused on one point for a few seconds, and then shifted the focus to another point for a few seconds, using his camera like an artist would a paintbrush.
 
 “That added the textures, effects, and shades. And I had photographs that were taking on the dimensions of paintings,“ he adds.
 
 “The idea of the series was to take scenes from everyday life and make them magical,“ says Chari.
