NEW DELHI: Several opposition members raised on Thursday the issue of transaction surcharge on credit/debit   at petrol pumps as well as new charges after a certain number of ATM withdrawals.

 SP MP   said the government had promised a “digital India” and that no fuel surcharge would be levied on payment through credit and debit cards, but customers are still paying them. 
 
 Following this, deputy chairman   asked MoS for parliamentary affairs   to convey the concerns to the finance minister.
