 The suspects were supposed to arrange the pilgrimage before   last year. Despite waiting for months, the suspects failed to organise their travel. “Following this, the men approached Sayyed who had taken them to the operator. Sayyed followed the issue with the suspects. However, the conmen never arranged the tour. They have been ignoring Sayyed’s calls,” Kuvar said.
