HATHRAS/ETAH: Uttar Pradesh chief minister and 
  said on Tuesday that there was no place for loyalists of   in the party. 

 Though Akhilesh did not name his uncle, he unambiguously told his audience at a rally in Hathras that those who were not with him in his “fight” for the party had no place in SP. “Some insiders are responsible for the discord in the party, and the same people are either instigating or directly opposing our candidates in the polls,” he said. 
 
 Though Akhilesh did not say anything about his father directly, the rift between them was apparent as photos of erstwhile party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav were conspicuously missing from posters put up by the 
  . Earlier in the day, in Etah district, the chief minister made an emotional appeal to voters and said these elections would not only decide the country’s fate, but his own too. 
 
 “If I lose, those people who had earlier tried to create a rift in the party would succeed in their designs and get the opportunity to target me,” Akhilesh said. 
 
 Expressing his concerns at the damage caused to the party due to infighting in the Yadav clan, Akhilesh said, “Pehle to cycle ke liye hi ladna pada, ek samay aisa laga ki cycle haath se chali jayegi, lekin cycle phir mil gayi… socho ki upar wala bhi hamare aur aapke sath kis tarha khada hua hai (First we had to fight for our symbol; at one point it seemed that we would lose it, but then god has stood by us).”
