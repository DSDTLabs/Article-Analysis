INDORE: A number of central jail inmates recently refused to get shaved by jail staff members. They stated that hygiene was the reason behind their move.

 The prisoners alleged that employees deployed by the jail administration to shave inmates were using the same razor to shave several prisoners, which could lead to infection and severely affect their health.
 
 Jail sources said that prisoners were not ready to get shaved by the jail staff. They feared they would get infected as razor blades carry infectious germs which can lead to hazardous health conditions.
 
 However, senior officials of the central jail tried to brush the matter under carpet by saying that the jail administration was looking into the matter.
 
 “We have arrangements to shave inmates on a regular basis and maintain proper care and hygiene. The jail administration does not take prisoners out for a shave due to obvious reasons and shave the inmates with care,” said Ramesh Chandra Arya, Central Jail superintendent.
 
 Arya said that the matter was being looked into and the guilty will be punished if the allegations are found to be true.
 
 The inmates were earlier given use and throw razor blades which were later banned following an instruction that prohibited all outside items on jail premises. In a move to avoid any untoward incidents, simple razor blades were barred as well on jail premises.
 
 The matter came to light when some of the jail inmates informed their relatives who visited them about the matter. A complaint was also lodged with the jail administration by a visitor.
