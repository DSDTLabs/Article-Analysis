 fell in love with Paris while shooting for 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' in the city. She plays a girl from Lucknow in the hit movie which released last year. It seems that the gorgeous actress had a gala time not just on the sets of the film but also otherwise, doing touristy things across Paris. 

 Dharma Productions took to Twitter to share a throwback picture of Anushka, craving for crepes on a quaint Parisian street. It's a candid click of the 28-year-old beauty standing at a crepe counter warming up her palms in the Paris cold and waiting for her order.
 
 The picture was captioned as, "Haven't seen anyone more enthusiastic about crepes in #Paris than @AnushkaSharma during the #ADHM shoot! #ThrowbackThursday."
