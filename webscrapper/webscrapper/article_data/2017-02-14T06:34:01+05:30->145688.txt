ALLAHABAD: Union minister of state skill development and entrepreneurship (independent charge) and senior   (BJP) leader, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, said that people of state are done with the family feud of the   (SP) and petty politics being played by   (BSP), and are now looking for better prospects for the development of the state. 

 He said that BJP is the only option for people of UP as Prime Minister   is committed to overall development of Uttar Pradesh. Rudy was in the city on Monday to campaign for BJP candidates. He also interacted with people in both urban and rural areas of the district. 
 
 While BJP’s agenda was only development, the rival camps were into caste and religion-based politics, said Rudy, adding that people of the state want change and Modi’s positive image has forced people of the state to look up to BJP, which is concerned about growth, development and increasing resources of the state.
 
 Rudy said that BJP-ruled states have witnessed growth by leaps and bounds. He also claimed that UP is the backbone of the economy but SP and BSP have ruined the state during their misrule.
 
 Targeting UP chief minister and national president of Samajwadi Party, Rudy claimed the deteriorating law and order situation has turned UP into a crime state and that the condition of UP has become worse than Bihar.
 
 On being asked about the effects of demonetization on voters, Rudy said that at least 70% of UP’s population are daily wage earners\ labourers and workers. They were least affected by demonetization and people of the state, too, appreciated the PM’s move of note ban. 
 
 When asked about the BJPs show in first phase polling, Rudy said BJP would sweep the polls with absolute majority.
