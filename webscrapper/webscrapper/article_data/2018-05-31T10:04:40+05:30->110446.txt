HYDERABAD: After re-opening as per academic schedule for 2018-19, state-run schools will function for half-day from June 4 to 8, stated a circular issued by Ranjeeva Acharya, special chief secretary to  , on Wednesday. 

 
 The circular was issued after members of   State Recognised School Managements Association took a decision to reopen on June 11, in view of the heatwave conditions in the state. A representation was also submitted to deputy chief minister and education minister, Kadiyam Srihari. The decision will be followed by 13,000 private state-run schools.
 
 "Based on representations made by the teachers' union and parents association to the commissioner and director of school education, Hyderabad, to extend the vacation due to heat, it was decided that classes will reopen as per the academic calendar on June 1. State Formation Day will be celebrated on June 2. From June 4 to June 8, the schools will run on 'half-day' basis," read the circular. 
 
 It added that the Badi Bata programme to improve enrolment of students in government schools will also be conducted from June 4 to June 8 between 7am and 11am. 
 
 The decision, however, brought little relief to the parents' community, as they argued that early start to the school will not benefit the students. 
 
 "It is insensitive of the government to start the school as early as 7am. They will be coming back around 1pm, which is equally bad," said Sangitha Rao, a parent.
