 "I spoke to him the other week actually I shaved my head after seeing him do the same thing. He inspired that and I went through a stage of us going to the gym quite a bit and since he moved to New York I've not seen him," said McVey.
 
 "We celebrated his 18th and I haven't seen him since then. It's a shame that he is the other side of the world. I am sure we will bump into each other again soon. I do keep in contact. I think it's great. His photography and the skateboarding, he really fits in with that New York lifestyle," he added.
 
 Brooklyn has appeared in the band's video for   and the band loves hanging out with him.
