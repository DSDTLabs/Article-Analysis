He said that Government of India’s Childhood Care and Education Policy, 2013 is a welcome step to cater to this important section of children. However, in Himachal Pradesh, it is experienced that numerous Early Childhood Care and Education Centres are mushrooming without any regulation and accountability to any authority resulting in a vacuum in this particular sphere, her said.

 He said the Bill further provides for approval of the state government for the establishment of such Centres in Private Sector and also provides for intervention of the state government in certain circumstances while at the same time giving considerable freedom to the private institutions and organizations. “Our State will be the first state in the country to make such a welfare legislation and actually try and realize the true spirit of the National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy, 2013,” he added.
