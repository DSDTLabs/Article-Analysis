HYDERABAD: The   ( ) has decided to auction 229 plots in various layouts in the city. They expect to raise 200 to 250 crore through the auctions. The funds starved metropolitan authority will utilise the fund for infrastructure projects. 

 Officials said the plots are spread across 25 layouts both upmarket areas including Jubilee Hills, Madhapur, Shaikpet, Nallagandla, Tellapur, Gopanpally and Miyapur as well as outskirts like Ameenpur, Ghatkesar, Pocharam and Bhongiri. Sources said the plot's up set price range would be between 3,000 per square yard to Rs 80,000 per sq yard depending on the location, size and usage. The up set price has been finalized at one-and-half times more than basic value of the registration department. 
 
 "Initially, we planned to release the e-auction notice on Friday. But due to technical issues, the notification will be released by Monday," HMDA estate officer K Gangadhar told STOI. 
 
 HMDA authorities said of the 229 plots, 146 are in the HMDA developed layouts. The rest are layouts developed by private firms which were transferred to the authority by way of gift deed (3% of entire layout as per norms). The most plots are in Miyapur (48), followed by Ameenpur (22),   (19), Mylardev Pally (18), Bachupally (15) and Tellapur (15). The total extent of the plots comes to about 1.22 lakh sq yards.
 
 As the auction is being conducted after five years, the authority expect a huge response from public. "Most people prefer HMDA plots as their title is clear and litigation free. They do not face any problem in getting loans and building permissions," HMDA metropolitan commissioner   said.
 
 The municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department gave its nod for the auction a month ago. Most plots are stray bits in various layouts auctioned by the authority earlier. These were not sold due to uneven surface, lack of approach road or the plots had less than 10 metres frontage.
