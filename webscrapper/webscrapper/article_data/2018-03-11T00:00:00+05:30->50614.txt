Savitribai Phule Pune University’s ( ) night   for female students has been in place to ensure safe commuting for them within the campus. However, of late, the purpose is being defeated due to a clash between student rush hours and the cab driver’s dinner timing.

 The cab driver has a dinner break from 9-9.30 pm and many students return to the campus during the same time. But the unavailability of a driver forces the girls to either wait at the main gate or walk the distance between the gate and hostel. The university’s security lapses have been in the spotlight over the years and there are still many secluded areas where safety of students can be compromised. A few   cases too were reported by students to the police recently.
 
 In such a scenario, girl students have been demanding an alternate driver to man the cab during the regular driver’s dinner break to avoid untoward incidences. While authorities have promised to look into the matter, there has been no development on the front till date.

 When Pune Times visited the campus, out of the two battery operated vehicles (a rickshaw and a golf cart), only the golf cart was found to be making trips on campus.
