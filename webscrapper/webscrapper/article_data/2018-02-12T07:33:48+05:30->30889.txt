GAYA: Two of the three youths—   and Md Anwar— arrested on Saturday for suspected terror links were forwarded to judicial custody, while the third, Md Shaad, has been released on a personal bond. 

 All three are residents of   locality of the town. The two were produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate  , who forwarded them to judicial custody for two weeks. Earlier, police registered a case against the two under Unlawful Activities and Arms Act. During investigation, no incriminating evidence came against Shaad. However, he may be called for further questioning, said police.
 
 Sources said evidence of money remittance to a Srinagar-based recipient through several transactions have strengthened the doubts about the involvement of the youth in suspicious activities. Though the amount remitted was not very significant but transactions are questionable. Cops are trying to ascertain the end use of the remitted money.
 
 Meanwhile, some of the accomplices of the arrested duo continued to dodge cops. Raids continued even on Sunday in several localities of the town to nab the absconders. TNN
