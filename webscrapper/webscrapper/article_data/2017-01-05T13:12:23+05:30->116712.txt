CHENNAI: Taking morning flights to Delhi or other northern destinations may not be reliable as fog, which can develop suddenly these days, is throwing flight schedules out of gear. Delays in Delhi, where jets are stuck due to poor visibility, have a cascading effect on other airports.
There was no fog on Wednesday, but flights scheduled to land between 7am and 7.30am were delayed by an hour due to congestion. As a result, Chennai experienced 43% delays, flight tracking agencies said.
 
 Airlines deployed pilots trained to handle poor visibility on the Delhi route but Tuesday's delays affected Wednesday's plans. Flights from Chennai reached Delhi on time, but flights to Chennai were delayed and arrived late.
 
 Airlines use planes to fly to multiple destinations on domestic sectors and delays occur at smaller airports like Amritsar, Agra, Jaipur and Lucknow. Flights from Kolkata were also getting delayed without a warning, an airline official said.
 
 A pilot said they didn't anticipate the fog.
 
 “We expected a few days to be foggy in December. But the weather was good. Tuesday's disruption hit more than 100 flights,“ he said. This is a seasonal problem and it would be better to plan trips in advance, he added.
 
 Passengers prefer evening flights. Hayagreev, a student, was supposed to travel by   to Chennai, but it was delayed by 13 hours.
 
 “I had to spend `9,000 on an evening flight because of  ,“ Hayagreev said.
 
 Fog in UAE two days ago affected international passengers arriving in Chennai.
 
 An   official said the authority is taking steps to inform airlines in advance about delays. “A system is in place to alert airlines about weather congestions. But   can develop quickly. Delays occur because jets sometimes allow departures from far-off airports, hoping visibility will improve during the flight.“
