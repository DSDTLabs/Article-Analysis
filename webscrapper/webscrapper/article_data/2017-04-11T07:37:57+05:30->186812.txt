KOLKATA: At the all-party meeting held on Monday for the ensuing  ,   commissioner A K Singh reportedly lost his cool. All political parties and the poll panel, though, agreed on the dates. The polling and counting are likely to be held on May 14 and May 17 respectively.

 The SEC, which was supposed to announce the dates before the press on Monday, postponed it till Thursday, triggering tension among the opposition.
 
 “When I pointed out that   has a rally at Domkol on Wednesday and hence he is deferring the announcement till Thursday, he suddenly lost his cool and told me that I was a liar. This is not expected from an election commissioner. He later apologised for his behaviour,“ senior CPM leader   said.
 
 “If he starts losing temper so easily then we are worried about the elections to be held in the days ahead.After the election to seven municipalities, the panchayat poll is scheduled next. We are worried if he will be able to handle it,“ said Congress leader Debabrata Basu.
 
 Subrata Bakshi, who was instrumental in handling the situation at the meeting on Monday, said, “The job of the election commissioner is to listen to the demands of the political parties and assure them of a free and fair election. We are hopeful that the political parties will be able to file their nomination peacefully and the people will be able to cast votes in a peaceful environment.“
