DHARMAPURI: Life was anything but bitter for K  , 46, of   at   here, for the past 34 years with tumours taking a heavy toll on his health.

 Life was normal for Palanisami until the age of 12. “Then small tumors started appearing in my body. Doctors, who examined me, failed to ascertain the cause for this condition,” he says. 
 
 Palanisami presently has as many as eight tumours, weighing at least 18kg. Pointing to the huge tumour that hangs from his neck area, he says, “This is affecting my vocal cord and I can’t speak properly.”
 
 What pains him most is the people’s hesitation to mingle with him. “Everyone stares at me when i venture out on the streets and hesitates to move with me,” he laments.
 
 Palanisami is also not in a health condition to do any manual labour to make a living. “I am finding it difficult to make both ends meet,” he says.
 
 Palanisami had approached the Dharmapuri district administration seeking medical assistance and employment opportunity. “But, there was no response. I want the district administration and the state government to take care of my treatment and medical expenses,” he says.
 
 His relatives told TOI that they would appeal the district administration and the state government to provide financial assistance to meet his medical expenses.
