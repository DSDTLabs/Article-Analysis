PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: With just two days left for election to the standing committee of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the race among corporators to bag nomination for membership has heated up. The election to select the 16-member standing committee will be held during the general body meeting on March 23.

 The standing committee is crucial as it controls the financial expenditure of the municipal body and approves development projects and contracts. Political parties are entitled to nominate corporators to the standing committee corresponding to the strength of the party in the House. This translates roughly into one nomination for every eight corporators in the 128-member House.
 
 There Bharatiya Janata Party has 77 corporators, Nationalist Congress Party (36), Shiv Sena (9) and the   (1). There are five independent corporators. This means that the ruling BJP can nominate 10 corporators,   can nominate five and the Sena, one. The MNS and independent corporators do not have any nomination.
 
 However, this can change if the Sena and the independent candidates join hands and register as a separate group with the divisional commissioner. If this happens, two corporators of this group could be nominated, but, then, the NCP will get to nominate only four corporators.
 
 “We have not invited applications from corporators. All local leaders will hold a meeting to decide on the names of corporators to be nominated to the standing committee,” said ruling party leader Eknath Pawar.
 
 The BJP will have to strike a balance by choosing corporators from supporters of Chinchwad BJP MLA Laxman Jagtap;  , associate BJP MLA from Bhosari; BJP Rajya Sabha MP Amar Sable; and former mayor  .
 
 NCP group leader Yogesh Behl said, “Corporators have time till Tuesday evening to submit applications for the posts. This list will be forwarded to NCP leader Ajit Pawar for final approval.”
