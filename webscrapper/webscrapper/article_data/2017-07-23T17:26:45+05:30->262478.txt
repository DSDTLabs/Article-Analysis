NAGPUR: Maharashtra   woman commission president   was compelled to leave a press conference mid-way after   activists disrupted the proceedings at Ravi Bhavan on Sunday. 

 Rahatkar was addressing media regarding forthcoming international conference on human trafficking to be held in Mumbai.
 
 The NCP activists led by their city women president Alka   barged into the press conference beating drums followed by her followers. 
 
 Rahatkar tried to assure them of strict actions in cases of atrocities against women but an apparently exasperated Kamble seemed to be in no mood to pay heed to any promises being made before her. 
 
 Kamble, arguing police or other authorities are least concerned, continued creating ruckus as one single woman constable failed to control the situation.
 
 Sadar police station staffers reached the place before taking Kamble and others into custody.
 
 Apart from Kamble, who had earlier shown black flag to Prime minister Narendra Modi too during his visit, also shouted slogans against failure of the authorities to curb the attacks on women.
