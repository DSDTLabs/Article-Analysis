AHMEDABAD: The Saurashtra,   and north   regions are staring at a water crisis for the second straight year. Dams in Saurashtra and Kutch have only 11% of their storage capacity of water. The storage in the 20 dams in Kutch is even lower than last year. According to the state government, the dams in Kutch have only 10.74% of their storage capacity and the 138 dams in Saurashtra have 11.18% of capacity. Government data shows that the water situation is slightly better in central and south Gujarat, while north Gujarat has only 21.59% of its capacity.

  The   situation in the state is worrying, as all most the north Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra regions have only about 50 MCM more water than last year. The state had received very meagre rainfall in the 2015 monsoon and rainfall in 2016 was below optimum as well.
 
 Officials said some 300 million cubic metres (MCM) of water is released every day on average, to meet drinking water and irrigation needs.
 
 The 202 dams in the state have water levels at 36.75% of the 15,774.24 million cubic metres (MCM) capacity. However, this is still 2,378.55 MCM more than in 2016. Officials said most of the water released is from dams in central and south Gujarat.
 
 The officials further said that the   dam has around 42.85 MCM more than last year.
