BENGALURU: Traffic   and regulating vehicle movement need not keep a notepad and pen to jot down the registration numbers of vehicles violating traffic rules. Bengaluru city traffic police has begun equipping these policemen with new smartphones, which will be installed with Violation-Recording app.

 The app can easily capture pictures of several vehicles violating traffic rules at a time and send the data to the Traffic Management Centre ( ), which generates notices to the owners of the vehicles.
 
 R Hithendra, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said totally 250 such mobile phones will be provided to constables soon. “In the first stage, we have provided 88 smartphones to our constables attached with traffic police stations in the   area and the remaining will be distributed to other cops across the city,” he said.
 
 The officer said police constables were facing problems while making a note of violators. “At intersections, violations like signal jumping most of the times involves several vehicles making it impossible to jot down the numbers of all violators. Often, violators would demand proof,” he said, adding that the app addresses all these problems.
 
 “Constables can record vehicles violating traffic rules and transmit videos to the TMC automatically. Police can generate notices with   and send them to the violators,” Hithendra added.
