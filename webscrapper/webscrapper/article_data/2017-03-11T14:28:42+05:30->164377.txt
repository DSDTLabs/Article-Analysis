BHOPAL: While surfing ‘jihad’ on internet, Atif Mujjafar and his team had stumbled upon ISIS propaganda materials that calls on followers to spill ‘the kafir’s (non-Muslim) blood’. They also had an order from their virtual mentors to ‘kill a random kafir’.

 On October 26 in 2016, the wannabe jihadists zeroed in on a retired principal in Vishupuri area on Kanpur and shot him dead, said officials who interrogated Atif and his gang after their arrest in Tuesday’s Bhopal-Ujjain   that left 10 passengers injured.
 
 Deceased Ramesh Shukla, 62, a resident of Vishnupuri village, had retired from the post of principal two years ago, but used to teach students because of his passion for teaching, sources said. He was shot dead from behind when he was returning from a school on his bicycle after a teaching session, police said.
 
 He had suffered multiple gun shots. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. Initially, police suspected a family feud behind the killing, but failed to reach any conclusion. It remained a blind murder mystery till Atif spilled the beans during his confessional statement to interrogators. 
 
 “This murder case is a tale of how disaffected Muslim youths can easily and inexorably come under the spell of the   terror group,” said an officer.
 
  Police has geared up to hand over the investigations to the NIA. An informal correspondence has already been made in this regard. A decision to this effect was taken at a law and order review meeting convened by the chief minister on Thursday. Government officials said the decision to hand over the cases was taken by the home ministry so that they could be probed thoroughly, considering sensitiveness of the case.
