TUTICORIN: In a bid to reduce road accidents,   district police has launched a case registration spree this Pongal. Since travelling is more during the extended weekend, due to Pongal, the district police have registered more cases. In just the first two days of the drive- Sunday and Monday- a total of 5,668 cases have been booked and continued on Tuesday as well.

 As many as 2,556 cases including 1,333 for not wearing helmets, three for more than two persons riding a two-wheeler, 133 drunken driving, 72 for over speeding and 32 for using mobile phone while riding was booked on Sunday. On Monday 3,112 cases were registered including 1,449 for not wearing helmet, 341 triples on two-wheeler, 245 drunken driving, 153 mobile phone driving and 99 for over speeding.
 
 Superintendent of Police (SP) of   district P   said that stringent action taken by the police helped the number of road accident deaths in the district to come down last year. He said that this year they would be making optimum use of the   cameras installed in city limits and at a few places in the outskirts to book cases against violators. The focus will be on booking persons without helmets.
 
 Police sources said that the traffic police will serve notices by getting the address details of the vehicle and impose a fine on them. If the vehicle has been sold and not reregistered, the fine would be paid by the person on whose name the vehicle is still registered. While there are possibilities of some persons changing their address the police hoped that this would however reduce traffic violations.
 
 The district police also conducted awareness on wearing helmets this Pongal. A sand sculpture depicting helmet was made at Muthu Nagar Beach to create awareness on the rule. Police roped in artist  , a drawing teacher in a school in the city, who worked on it for two days and got it ready on Sunday.
