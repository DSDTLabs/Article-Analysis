HYDERABAD: In yet another jolt to TDP in Telangana, party strongman from Gajwel constituency   on Saturday quit in the presence of his supporters at Gajwel.

 Vanteru Pratap is likely to join the Congress. Sources close to him said he may join   in the presence of Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on May 18.
 
 Though T-TDP state president   said that he has not received any resignation letter yet,   announced his resignation to his followers at a specially-convened meeting at Gajwel. He had contested against KCR in 2014 Assembly elections. Leaders in TDP and Congress said he is a strong candidate to be pitched against KCR in 2019 elections.
