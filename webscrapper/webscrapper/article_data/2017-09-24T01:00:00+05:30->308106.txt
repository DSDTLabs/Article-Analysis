GAYA: Driver of the   passenger   R P  , who was thrashed by angry passengers at a short distance from   station on Friday, lodged a criminal case against deputy station superintendent S K Sinha on Saturday for deliberately forcing him in a situation where his (driver’s) life was at risk. The case has been registered with rail police station.

 The driver alleged despite knowing that the track was under repair and traffic was blocked for four hours, the deputy superintendent and one more official gave him the green signal at the Gaya station and got the train stopped at a short distance away. The passengers’ main grouse was that when traffic was blocked, why the officials forced the train out of the station. The train remained stranded at a deserted place for several hours making the passengers angry.
 
 Angry passengers tied the driver to a pole and thrashed him, which necessitated his hospitalisation. Rail area officer   said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. “Prima facie it appears that the train was stopped at the west home cabin due to lack of coordination between Gaya and Mughalsarai traffic control rooms. Instead of filing case against the deputy superintendent, the driver should have filed the case against the passengers who indulged in violence,” the area officer added.
