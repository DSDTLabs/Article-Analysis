RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: Chief minister   said on Thursday that the state government will pursue the process of changing Ahmedabad’s name to Karnavati.

 “We require two-thirds majority in the Parliament to get the name changed. This is an on-going process and we will surely make efforts in this direction in the future,” Rupani said to a question in Rajkot. The CM was in his hometown to celebrate  .
 
 The issue was raked up on Wednesday when Bapunagar MLA and former mayor Himmatsinh Patel asked a question in the state assembly that how many times has the state government represented to the Union government about renaming Ahmedabad to Karnavati in the past two years as on December 31, 2017, and what has been the central government's response to this request. The government replied on record that no proposal to change Ahmedabad's name to Karnavati has been made in past two years and there is no question of the central government's response to the same.
 
  alleged that BJP's double-faced approach on the issue has been exposed. “In the past, BJP had made tall promises to rename Ahmedabad as Karnavati to encash   votes. When BJP was first elected to power in   between 1987 and 1992, it had moved a proposal to change name to Karnavati,” Paten said.
 
 
 
 
 However, this proposal was turned down by then   government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy LK Advani. The issue is being used by BJP only to fetch Hindu votes and the party is not been serious about reviving the same," Patel told TOI. 
 
 In fact, after Vijay Rupani government was sworn-in in December 2017, senior BJP leader Subramanian   had invoked the BJP to rename the city as Karnavati. "I urge PM to restore original name Karnavati for Ahmedabad. As CM he had sent the proposal to PM MMS. Now Namo is PM so he must finalize it," Swamy had tweeted.
