VELLORE: Christian Medical College (CMC)   will celebrate the centenary of medical education with a series of conferences, medial camps and programmes. Celebrations will begin with the centenary run from the   campus to the Oval Ground at   on January 26.

 CMC was started on August 12, 1918 by Dr   to empower women with the “Not to be served but to serve”.
 
 “We never compromised on the vision and mission of the founder. We have continued to stay relevant in every possible way, to fill gaps to suit the present needs of the country,” said principal of the institution Anna B   on Tuesday.
 
 The first batch of licentiate medical programme had 18 girl students. While four dropped out of the three-year course, 14 students appeared for the final exam and cleared it. Four of them with distinction.
 
 From those humble beginnings, CMC today offers undergraduate, postgraduate and super speciality training courses through 49 departments. “Most of the doctors passed out from our institution are staying in the country and serving the rural people,” said Pulimood.
 
 CMC director Dr J V Peter said the institution was a “trendsetter in health care”. “We are following the bottom-up approach and models given to us 100 years ago. We are training very good doctors to transform the lives in rural areas,” he said.
 
 Calling the common counselling for admission as the biggest challenge faced by the institution, Pulimood said the Medical Council of India had come down hard on institutions indulging in admission malpractices. “We are not against the rules and regulations. But we want to stick to our selection process,” she said. The institution has been following a transparent triple-test selection process to get suitable candidates determined to serve rural people, she said expressing hope that the   would pass an order in favour of the institution.
