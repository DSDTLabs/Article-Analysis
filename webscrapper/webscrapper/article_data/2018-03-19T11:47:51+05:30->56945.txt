BHUBANESWAR: Students have alleged that the decision of the authorities to shut the   (CUO) sine die following their protest is harsh because they did not resort to any form of violence. However,   Sachidananda Mohanty defended his pre-emptive action, saying the situation could have gone out of hand. 

 Mohanty had ordered the shutting of CUO sine die on the second day of the indefinite strike called by the students on Thursday to press for their 60-point charter of demands. 
 
 Students had sat on a dharna at the main campus of the university at   in Koraput on Wednesday evening demanding the fulfilment of their demands. They include, among others, appointment of permanent professors, round-the-clock healthcare facilities at the campus,   and hostel facilities for research scholars, shifting of the main administrative office to its main campus. 
 
 During the agitation, there was a heated exchange of words between the students and the vice chancellor over these issues. To prevent any untoward incident, the vice chancellor had ordered shut the institution till further notice. The students condemned the move. "Is it wrong to stage a demonstration on campus to get our legitimate demands fulfilled? We did not indulge in any form of violence, but the university authorities surprisingly declared the institution closed sine die. Now who will recover the loss of study till the classes commence," said an aggrieved student. 
 
 They said the decision was too harsh. It shows the defiant attitude of the authorities, the students alleged. However, theVC said the university authorities took the decision after a long discussion with faculty members. "Some of the students heckled me and asked me to discuss the issues with them without taking any faculty member to the place of dharna. They had abducted an ambulance driver two days ago as a mark of protest. Some of my rivals are instigating the students to do all these things," he added.
