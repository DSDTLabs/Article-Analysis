PANAJI: Parts of Goa received light to moderate showers on Saturday evening due to an upper air cyclonic circulation over north interior   and adjoining Goa and Konkan.

 In some areas, the rain was very heavy and accompanied by thunder and flashes of lightning. “The rain is due to this upper air cyclonic circulation extending up to 1.5 km above mean sea level,” said M L  , director, meteorological centre.
 
 The showers caught many on the wrong foot, as the rain lasted for some time and pools of water formed, especially in the state capital. The meteorological centre is likely to review the situation on Sunday.
