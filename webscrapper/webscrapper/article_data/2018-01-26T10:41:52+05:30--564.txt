KOLKATA: Delhi edged out Uttar Pradesh by a mere three runs in a low-scoring Group B match to qualify for the final of the   meet on Thursday. Delhi will play Rajasthan in final on Friday.

 Delhi owed their maiden appearance in the final to their bowlers, who defended a below-par tally of 140/9 at the Jadavpur University's Salt Lake campus ground.
 
 Skipper   and fellow-pacers Kulwant Khejrolia, Subodh Bhati and Lalit Yadav maintained an immaculate line and length outside the off-stump to frustrate UP batsmen.
 
 Playing their last Super League match, which was a virtual semifinal, UP's top-four batsmen, including skipper  , got starts but failed to build a significant partnership in their pursuit of victory.
 
 Poor shot-selection proved to be UP's bane and they found themselves four down for 54 inside nine overs. Youngsters   (34) and Sarfraz Khan (13) raised hopes by stitching together 41 runs, but with both batsmen getting overambitious and falling to left-arm spinner  , UP needed 41 runs in the last five overs.
 
  kept them in the game with a delightful 33 off 18 balls.
 
 
  Delhi 140/9 (  58, Milind 32; Azim Khan 2/12) bt UP 137 in 20 overs (Rinku Singh 34; Pawan Negi 2/13)
