GHAZIABAD: The   is planning to   the Hindon   with the   skirting the main city, in an attempt to ease traffic congestion at Raj Nagar Extension.

 Officials in the GDA said they were looking for land in   area to construct the 5km link road. Once ready, the road will benefit those travelling to Delhi, who can skirt the traffic snarls at Raj Nagar Extension and head to the capital through Loni.
 
 Raj Nagar Extension witnesses long snarls during officer hours as it serves as an influx of vehicles to and from western Uttar Pradesh. The link road will take off before the Extension and pass through villages like Morti and Shahpur on the west of the elevated road to meet the Northern Peripheral Expressway.
 
 “A link road connecting the Hindon Elevated Road with the Northern Peripheral Expressway has been mentioned in our zonal plan. We knew once the elevated road was opened to vehicles, there would be massive traffic jams at Raj Nagar Extension,” said Ishtiyaque Ahmad, chief architect and town planner in the GDA. “The proposed link road is aimed at solving this problem,” he added.
 
 According to the official, GDA has already acquired 16 hectares for the proposed road and is in talks with farmers in Shahpur village for the remaining land. “Once the road is complete, Raj Nagar Extension will get connected to Delhi via Loni. This will be a big boost for inter-state movement of traffic via Ghaziabad,” Ahmed said.
 
 Movement of traffic got a leg up in Ghaziabad after the launch of the 10.5km elevated road, which brought down travel time between UP Gate and Raj Nagar Extension to a mere 10 minutes.
