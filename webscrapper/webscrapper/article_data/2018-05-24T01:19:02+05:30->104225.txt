NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Wednesday came to the rescue of   working on   for decades and ordered their   as teachers in various   run by Delhi government and the  .

 “The petitioners’ hope of returning to their homes and for peace in the Valley may not yet be attainable, but the acceptance of their claims should act as a balm, re-kindle their confidence in the society and our commitment to equality and equal opportunity,” a bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Deepa Sharma observed in its order.
 
 These migrants have been working in government and municipal schools on contract for over two decades but had not been regularised. HC noted that it was a “sad day” for the society that teachers have to move court for their rightful claim and directed Delhi government, the east, south and north municipal corporations, and New Delhi Municipal Council to pass orders within eight weeks so that the teachers get regularised from the date of their first appointment.
 
 Several teachers present in court, thanked the judges and broke down after pronouncement of the verdict. They had come to the capital in the mid-80s, faced with large-scale communal violence in the Kashmir Valley. 
 
 To provide employment to the educated migrants, the Delhi government had on April 2, 1994, decided to appoint one educated member from each migrant family as teacher depending on her or his suitability for the different categories of jobs. However, they had continued to remain on contract.
