 Coimbatore: If you’re heading out on vacation, here’s an item to add to your pre-vacation to-do list: Make sure your home isn’t an easy target for burglars.
 
 In the second such incident in the city within a week, burglars broke into a locked house at Cheran Maa Nagar and decamped with Rs 5lakh-worth gold jewellery. The house owner was in Udhagamandalam when the burglars struck, police said.
 
 “House owner Balaji had left for Udhagamandalam in Nilgiris district along with his family on May 10. He returned on Saturday evening to find the lock on the front door broke opened and gold jewellery missing,” an officer at the Peelamedu police station said. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police S Lakshmi requested those in holiday mood to inform their nearest police station before leaving on vacation. “We have also directed our personnel to collect details of locked houses at various police station limits. Our patrolling teams will monitor locked houses,” she told TOI.
 
 Simple measures like directing the newspaper boy to suspend delivery till you return can go a long way in preventing house burglaries, Lakshmi said. “Many people who go on vacation forget to suspend the delivery of newspaper. Noticing newspapers accumulated on the porch, burglars can easily deduce that the house is uninhabited. Some people are in the habit of keeping the porch light on before leaving. Such houses also attract burglars,” she said.
 
 As a precautionary measure, police are also keeping a tab on history-sheeters, the officer added.
 
 Last Wednesday, burglars broke opened an industrialist’s house on a posh residential colony at Ramanathapuram and took away 40 sovereigns of gold jewellery and Rs 1.25 lakh in cash. Shivanand, owner of a garment unit, was in Bengalauru at the time of the incident.
