I began dancing at the age of eight. I have always been an introvert by nature, so dancing proved to be a plus point in my growing up years. As I grew older, I got the confidence to just step out there and prove myself.

  To be even better became my goal. I began auditioning for various dance events and festivals from college, opened up to people through our practice sessions and just let myself loose. 
 
 It slowly dawned on me that through this passion of mine, I was becoming a different person. A change was happening for the better. It gave me my career. Being footloose helps me ooze out my frustration in a healthy way. It makes me feel lighter after a hard day at work. What, at times, I can’t really express in words, I express emotionally with my moves. 
 After entering this industry, pressure mounted because of stiff competition. But dance made my outlook very positive. I gave my all to my art instead of focusing my energies on all the negative vibes that were flowing around. Music and moving to the beats and rhythm made me calm, and infused more positive thoughts into me. It created a different kind of self awareness in me – I could just leave behind all the baggage that wasn’t needed, and focus on the changes I could bring about in myself. 
 
 Dancing is like dreaming with your feet. I am just dancing through all the good that comes my way!
