Mumbai: Minutes after the stampede broke out, Manish Mishra, a resident of the railway quarters close to  , dialled  , the  , at 10.32 am. The   personnel asked him to try the railway police since the accident had occurred on railway premises. “I dialled 182, RPF’s helpline, but couldn’t reach them for nearly 10 minutes. Then I got another number, 1322 (one of the railway helplines). They asked me to describe everything I saw and wasted time,” said Mishra, who along with many locals helped in rescue operations.

 “There was an ambulance outside the station that was used. We also hailed a few taxis to rush people to hospital,” said Mishra. Locals who played a major role in rescuing people said the response from security agencies such as police, the   (RPF) and the   (GRP) was cold.
 
 Kishore Kamat, another resident, said the police control room told him it would take 20-25 minutes for them to reach the spot. “We were waiting for ambulances. There were people who needed emergency medical help but the response wasn’t there as expected.” 
 
 There were just three GRP personnel at Elphinstone Road station. Since it is not a nodal station, there is no railway police outpost. It falls within the jurisdiction of Mumbai Central GRP. 
 
 The city police reached the spot before additional GRP forces could. “We took half an hour to reach Elphinstone after the incident was reported. By the time we arrived, victims were already being sent to hospitals in ambulances," said an official from Mumbai Central GRP. Later, RPF personnel arrived.
