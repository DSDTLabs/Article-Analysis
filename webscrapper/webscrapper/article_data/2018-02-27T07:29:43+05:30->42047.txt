RAJKOT: A large cache of liquor worth Rs 94 lakh was seized from a godown in Ektanagar area of Sihor town in   district on Sunday night. One person was arrested in this connection. 

 A total of 65,760 Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) bottles and 216 beer cans which are worth Rs 94 lakh was seized.
 
  alias Pintu (27), a resident of Pali district in Rajasthan, who used to work as a watchman at the godown was arrested from the spot. 
 
 “During interrogation, Pintu said that the liquor was sent by bootlegger   from Nadiad. Bootlegger Jayesh Makwana, who owns the godown, fled before the raid. Both Marwadi and Makwana are yet to be arrested,” said an investigating official.
 
 Police sources said that Makwana was an active   worker and had sought ticket to contest the recently held nagarpalika polls. But he was denied one. Instead, the BJP gave mandate to Makwana’s sister-in-law.
