BENGALURU:   MP and former Union minister   said the   government had missed out on exploiting the opportunities thrown up by the global economy.

 
 Speaking at a panel discussion on ‘Reshaping Ideals, Rethinking Policies’ on Saturday, Tharoor said: “Modi government seems to have missed the bus particularly in the manufacturing sector. Modi had promised two crore jobs every year before elections. Eight crore jobs should have been generated in the country by now. But the fact is that he managed to generate just 18 lakh jobs in the last four years.”
 
 “What happened to the Foxconn’s 3 billion investment promise under the Make In India programme? India’s position is dropping in all global rankings despite tall claims by Modi,” he said.
 
 Randeep Surjewala, chief spokesperson of Congress, alleged that private companies were the biggest beneficiaries of the Centre’s crop insurance scheme. “Private companies made more than Rs 14,500 crore under the crop insurance scheme but farmers were ignored.   has helped insurance companies not farmers”.
 
 ‘Politics interested in youth’
 
 At another event, Tharoor urged youngsters to vote, saying: “Too bad if you are not interested in politics, but politics is interested in you, because what happens in politics will determine your future and the opportunities you have in life.”
 
 He was speaking on ‘The Role of Reason in Indian Politics’ at the National Institute of Advanced Studies.
 
 Elaborating on the topic, Tharoor said that by giving power to emotions over interest, voters were being irrational. He emphasized how politics in recent years has seen the abandonment of reason by the ruling party that had unleashed forces that aren’t based on reason.
