BAREILLY: Three months after an accident happened at   level crossing near   railway station in  , a probe set up by railway authorities found station master guilty of negligence. An oil tanker driver,   was killed when   express train had rammed into his vehicle at Gausganj railway crossing on October 25.
 
  Station master   had been suspended after the incident.
  
  A senior official at the divisional railway manager’s office in   division said the three-member inquiry report has been sent to the general manager,   and appropriate action would be taken against the station master.
  
  After the incident, the railway authorities had admitted that it was a “human error” that had led to the accident and suspended the station master and gateman of the level crossing,  , for not closing the gate. While oil tanker driver Sohan Lal died on the spot, six passengers had sustained injuries. 
  
  It was only the last week when the government sent a cheque of Rs 2 lakh to Sohan Lal’s family.
  
  After the incident, the Northern Railway had initiated an inquiry into the matter. The inquiry team recorded evidence of more than 12 people, including a witness of the incident.
  
  “It is found that the station master didn’t inform the gateman to close the gate before the train arrived. The gateman had given a green signal to the train without exercising caution. Besides, the gate was not equipped with interlocking system of signalling. Had it been so, the accident could have been averted,” a senior railway official said, adding that the traffic department in railways had been instructed to take action against the station master.
