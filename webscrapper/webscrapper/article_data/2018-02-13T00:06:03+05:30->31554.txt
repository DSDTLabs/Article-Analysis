Mumbai: Mumbaikars heading to Goa will be able to cut travel time by two hours as Mumbai Port Trust plans to extend the   from   to  . MBPT had planned an 8km ropeway between Sewri and  .

 Union minister Nitin   said, “Those heading to Goa can cut travel time by two hours as they can take the highway to Goa after alighting at Uran.” A RoRo service has also been planned between Bhaucha Dhakka and Nerul, and Mandwa, from April 1. Indian Rail Port Corporation Ltd (IRPCL) will execute the ropeways.
 
 Gadkari, who was here to attend a seminar on ropeways, said, “Ropeways can greatly help reduce congestion. For example, a ropeway with a bus can be planned along the coast. This can help reduce congestion in suburban trains too.”
 
 Gadkari said the cost of a ropeway per km was cheaper than that for a Metro. He said, “The government will not provide any subsidy for the ropeway project as it is a profitable venture. Interested parties should manufacture the infrastructure in India so that capital costs come down, which will result in lower fares.”
 
 Anoop Agarwal, MD, IRPCL said, “An advanced ropeway cable car can carry 6,000 people in peak hours per direction, as against 150-400 with older technology.” 
 
 Vikram Singhalese, executive director & CEO, Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, said, “The government should provide a green channel for clearance as no trees will be cut.” tnn
