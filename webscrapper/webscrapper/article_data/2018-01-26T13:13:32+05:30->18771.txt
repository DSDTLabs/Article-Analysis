QUEPEM: A Rs 6-crore road   project from   to Tilamoll on the Margao-Curchorem highway, which has been already sanctioned by the government, has run into a hurdle with local residents expressing concern over the fate of houses along the stretch.

  and opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’  , who is pursuing the project, called a meeting with citizens on Thursdayafternoon to discuss the issue of broadening both sides of the   by a metre.
 
 Kavlekar told the residents that the widening is urgently required due to increasing traffic, as the road is very narrow. 
 
 Resident   said that road widening will not solve the problem and requested the   to place a proposal for a bypass road before the assembly session for a one-time solution.
 
 Another resident called for a blueprint of the plan to assess how many structures as well as underground pipelines will be affected due to the widening.
