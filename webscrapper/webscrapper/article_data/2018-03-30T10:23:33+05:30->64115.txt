AHMEDABAD: A group of   has decided to hold a meeting at the   in the city on March 31 to   against the decision of the   ( ) to conduct retests of class X mathematics and class XII economics papers.

 There was confusion among the parents and the students throughout the day on Thursday after some posts on social media platforms claimed that the retest would be held in the last week of April. Anxious parents began surfing the CBSE website but could not find any announcement there.
 
 Manish Panchal, whose son Deep had appeared in the class X examination, said, “My son was very happy when he returned from the examination centre. Soon after hearing the news of retest, the child became depressed. After seeing his condition, I thought that as a parent I should also do something as not only Deep, but many students like him have been facing similar anxiety. I then decided to hold a meeting of the parents at the Gujarat University on Saturday to chalk out the future plan.”
 
 Panchal was to go to Mumbai after his son’s examination. “Why should lakhs of students suffer for CBSE officials’ fault? It would have been pertinent to hold re-examinations at only those places where question papers were leaked.”
 
 Ketan Patel, a parent, said, “My son was to go out for a party yesterday night, but as soon he heard the news about retest, he locked himself in a room and began studying again. He is afraid that the board would set a difficult paper for retest.”
 
 An online petition, which was started on Wednesday evening, has so far got support from 30,000 students. The petition states that many students had planned to take part in other events after the exams. Families of many students had planned to go out of town. Some students are not in a position to appear in re-examination, the petition says.
