Rajkot: Bridegroom Vijay Vaghela had no idea that his marriage had turned into mourning and he tied the nuptial knot as per the rituals. Vijay had gone ahead in another car and had no clue that his 30 family members including parents were no more. 

 In fact, he was to travel in the same truck but the plan was changed at the last moment and he was sent in a car.
 
 He was deliberately not told about the tragedy by his relatives who got the news of the accident just before the marriage rituals were about to begin. Some community leaders had a quick discussion and unanimously decided that the marriage will not be cancelled. 
 
 “We did not inform Vijay about the tragedy. When he inquired about others, we told him that truck has deveoped some technical snag on the road and we should not be missing the muhurat (auspicious time period) of the marriage,” said on his relatives. The bride’s sister also got married in the same function. 
 
 It was only after all the rituals were over he and his bride were taken to their native Anida village where the news of the accident were broken to him.
 
 All the deceased were buried as per their rituals in Anida.
