JAIPUR:   University has extended the affiliation of government run B. Ed colleges Baba Bhagwan Das Government   (Chimanpura) and   (Kaladera) in Jaipur for another year with many discrepancies which has raised questions on policy makers.

 Both the colleges are having severe faculty crunch with Chimanpura having one teacher and Kaladera having six violating the guidelines provided by   (NCTE) 2014. According to the numbers prescribed by the NCTE 2014, for an intake of two basic units of 50 students each, that is total 200 students, there should be at least 16 teachers in the college.
 
 Surprisingly the college of Chimanpura with one faculty is granted affiliation unconditionally and Kaladera was asked to appoint proper faculty and give evidences for such till June 15, 2018. Even last year Rajasthan University extended affiliation to the Chimanpura College on the condition of hiring more teachers and was asked to provide evidences for the same. 
 
 Now the questions may arise about why the affiliation to both the colleges was extended even though they haven’t fulfilled last year’s condition. Also, about why affiliation to the   was granted unconditionally this year even after having one teacher and not to Kaladera who have six teachers. Even after violation of NCTE rules, no action has been taken against authorities.
 
 Students of the Chimanpura College have complained that they have never attended a single class for the last four months. Last year a no objection certificate was issued by the Commissioner of College Education, government of Rajasthan, in which it was mentioned that colleges affiliated by different universities should have required number of faculties in both these colleges (along with other government colleges). But the order is not fulfilled till date.
 
 None of the members of the higher education department and Rajstasthan University was available for comment.
