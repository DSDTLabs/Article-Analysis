  : Even as BJP projects   as the frontrunner for the position of chief minister, its ally Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) has raised the demand for a tribal chief minister. 

 "In all northeastern states, the chief ministers are tribal, except in Tripura which has been under communist rule so far. We feel BJP will change that," IPFT president NC Debbarma said. "This is our demand and we seek the attention of BJP leaders to this issue," he added.
 
 Since 1993, when   was chief minister, no tribal has occupied the post. IPFT's demand is bolstered by its good show in the assembly election, where it won eight of the nine seats it contested. 
 
 BJP's response was terse. "BJP legislators will elect their leader on Tuesday. But they will not be guided by IPFT or others. They will decide who the leader will be after taking into consideration all aspects," BJP general secretary   said. He added the BJP-IPFT government is likely to take the oath of office and secrecy on Friday in a grand event at the largest open stadium of the city. The schedule will be confirmed after Prime Minister  's presence at the swearing-in ceremony can be guaranteed. BJP president Amit Shah, Union home minister Rajnath Singh, road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari are expected to be in attendance.
