NEW DELHI: Expelled SP functionary   has claimed that   manoeuvred to ensure that the “cycle” symbol was not frozen in the wake of the factional feud in his party, and even suggested that the tussle between the SP founder and his son, UP CM  , was a fixed affair.

 “Let me tell you one undisclosed fact. Every father loves to lose at the hands of his son. Whatever the jhagda (wranglings), it was all artificial.
 
 It is my conviction and I have information to this effect that   secretly decided to give the bicycle symbol to Akhilesh, and on the day following the deadline, he wrote to the chief election commissioner requesting him to give the symbol to his son. Yeh pakki baat hai (it is a fact),” Singh told India TV.
 
 The assertion of Singh reinforces the suspicion that the SP patriarch scripted the tussle with Akhilesh to ensure a smooth transition of power to his son, and is at odds with the narrative that the UP CM had to rebel against his father because he wanted to make a clean break with the taint of corruption and lawlessness associated with the party.
 
 Asked whether the entire sequence of events during the SP “family battle” was a ‘drama’, Singh, who praised PM Modi and did not rule out joining BJP, replied, “What did you see in the end?   is sucking his thumb, Amar Singh stands expelled. I became an outsider, and those petty people became insiders.”
