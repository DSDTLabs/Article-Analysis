MUMBAI: After struggling with visa issues, reigning British champion jockey   landed in Mumbai late on Friday. The Brazilian saddle artist is set to ride Kolkata Derby winner Aggregated in the   (Grade 1) at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Sunday.

 
 The 37-year-old saw the Malesh Narredu-trained Kolkata challenger at the racecourse on Saturday morning for the first time and will directly sit astride the four-year-old colt in the Indian Derby. It begs the question - how will he ride the horse if he is yet to get a feel of him? “On the way from the paddock to the starting stalls is enough for me to get the feel of the horse,” De Sousa told TOI on Saturday. “It’s all about horsemanship,” he added with a smile.
 
 The added advantage for De Sousa is that he knows the Mahalaxmi racecourse like the back of his hand. It is here that he had learned the tricks of the trade while riding between 2005 and 2009 before becoming hot property in international racing after picking up two jockey championships in Britain in 2015 and 2017. “I learned a lot here after riding during those four years,” said the man who had guided Antonios to a famous victory in the 2009 Indian Derby.
 
 “The last two winners of the Kolkata Derby, Desert God (2016) and   (2017), came here and won the Indian Derby and I hope Aggregated will do the same,” said De Sousa, indicating that he had done his homework. “Malesh is an excellent trainer. He will let me know the secrets of how to handle Aggregated,” he added.
