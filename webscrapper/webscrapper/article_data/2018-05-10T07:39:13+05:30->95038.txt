"It is ascertained that there is less production of potato this year in the producing states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, which has led to the rise in price in our state.

"Potato is the most essential vegetable in the kitchen and in summer we use more of it. But due to high prices, we have had to cut its consumption," said Hemangini Das, a homemaker living in the capital city. 
 
 The civil supply department on Wednesday conducted raids at several vegetable mandis of Cuttack, including the one at  , following Yadav's letter. "We have conducted raid on 14 vegetable godowns and found no extra stock there," said district civil supply officer Amar Mohapatra.
