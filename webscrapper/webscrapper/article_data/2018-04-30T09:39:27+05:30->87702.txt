ANNING: Indian Davis Cupper   charged to the title in the $150,000   in Anning, China on Sunday. 

 
 The 28-year-old, unseeded in the highest grade event of the   circuit, beat Eygpt’s   in the final for the biggest win of his career. The Chennai-based pro, who pulled off a decisive win for India in the   earlier this month, started the tournament ranked 260 in the world. In the semifinal and final rounds of the clay court tournament, Gunneswaran came from behind to score victories.
 
 He beat Safwat 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 in the title round to take home $21,600 and, more importantly, 125 ranking points. Gunneswaran sent down four aces in the 1 hour 53-minute encounter, which he took charge of with his serve.
 
 “Mental toughness got me through this one,” Gunneswaran said after clinching his first ATP Challenger title. “I’m extremely happy that I found a way to win. It wasn’t my best match in terms of tennis, but one of my best mentally.”
 
 On Monday, the left-handed Gunneswaran will climb to a career-high ranking, around the 180 mark, which will make him third highest-ranked among Indians, behind Yuki Bhambri and Ramanathan Ramkumar.
