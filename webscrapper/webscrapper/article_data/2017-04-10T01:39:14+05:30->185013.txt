Lucknow: Citing recent attacks on people carrying cows, former minister and senior Samajwadi Party leader Mohammed   on Sunday returned the   which was gifted to him by Shankaracharya of Govardhan Peeth, Swami Adhokshjanand Maharaj, fearing that any vigilante could kill the animal to ‘defame’ him.

 The cow and the calf were sent to Govardhan Peeth on-board a truck accompanied by old Azam aide and Rampur district’s former SP chief Amrendra Singh Chauhan. He also sent a two-page expressing his inability to keep the bovine at his cattle shed in Masiyapura Shumali village of Rampur.
 
 In the letter, addressed to Swami Adhokshjanand, Azam says though he is indebted by the gift that he received in October 2015, he is afraid that if the cow and the calf died of any conspiracy or natural causes, the incident can take a serious turn particularly in the light of Alwar-like lynching incidents. Azam stated that he had taken good care of cow and the calf for a year and a half like all the other buffaloes at his cattle shed that were looked after but in the present scenario, he thought it was better to return the bovine.
 
 "Muslims were living in an atmosphere of insecurity ... Any cow vigilante might harm or even kill the beautiful and beneficial animal to defame me and the Muslim community," the letter said. Khan alleged a "vicious propaganda has been launched against Muslims in the country and their condition was even worse than that of slaves". In his letter Azam pointed out that cow vigilante were targeting hapless Muslims in the name of cow smuggling and in such a surcharged atmosphere people, particularly Muslims were feeling insecure and afraid. 
 
 He accused the BJP government of adopting double standards, claiming that the rich and the affluent were being served beef in five-star hotels but the poor were being deprived of it and being harassed, attacked and even eliminated.
