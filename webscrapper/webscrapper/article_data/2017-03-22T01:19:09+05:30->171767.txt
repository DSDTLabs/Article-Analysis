MUMBAI: Following the controversy, which has erupted over the BJP-led government’s directive stating that the state’s approval is a must for renewing the lease for the Mahalaxmi racecourse and gymkhanas in Mumbai, the Shiv Sena in the BMC said that nothing could deter their plans for a theme park over the racecourse. 

 The Sena on Tuesday said that by differentiating the racecourse and gymkhanas from other lease properties the government was trying to differentiate between two classes of the society. 
 
 “It’s only the elite, which visit the gymkhanas and racecourse while something like a theme park would be visited by all. Our demand for the theme park over the racecourse still remains,” said Shiv Sena leader in the BMC Yashwant Jadhav. 
 
 “The state’s directive has said that the government’s approval would be required in case of the racecourse and hence they will soon send a proposal to them ( ) for setting up of a theme park. “We will send the proposal and let the government decide if they want to horses to run over the racecourse or open it up to the public at large,” said Jadhav. 
 
 With the government directive, the BMC can now go ahead and implement the lease policy for the remaining properties. Therefore to renew the lease of each of these properties they would need to table a proposal before the civic improvements committee and the corporation that has the authority to approve it. However, in case of the racecourse and gymkhanas a separate policy from the government is being expected, said civic officials. 
 
 The racecourse is among 160 schedule ‘W’ properties that the state government owns, but which it has authorized the BMC to lease out and fix conditions for the lease. In May 2013, the Royal Western India Turf Club’s 99-year-old lease on the land ended and it is yet to be renewed.
