NEW DELHI: Three-time chief minister of Delhi   has   the   that   with the   and   would yield  . Based on her own experience she said, an elected government in Delhi faces complex governance challenges due to its special status under the Constitution. “Recognising the challenge, the elected government has to rise above politics to work with the LG and Centre to enable governance,” she told TOI.

 “I can say being the CM of Delhi can be tricky. One has to learn to work within the contours of the framework laid out under the Constitution,” she said.
 
 She added that there was no running away from the fact that under the Constitutional scheme, the LG has an important role as he steers decisions on land and police. “Also people don’t understand this legal position and they have all their expectations from the elected government. Compared to the Delhi Police or the Centre we (Delhi government) received the maximum flak in the aftermath of the Nirbhaya gangrape case,” Dikshit said.
 
 She refused to concede that she always had a comfortable equation with the LG and Centre. “There were many issues where challenges arose, but then I would in my weekly meetings with the LG, take the files and talk it over. Either I would convince him or he would manage to convince me. This is how things worked. In case of metro and CNG too, I went to the Centre to explain the need to convince them. It was a BJP government there. Look at where the the metro has reached today and CNG was so critical to deal with the pollution problem then,” she said.
 
 Dikshit reiterated that she did not have it easy as Delhi CM. “Once the people elect you they expect you to deliver and this is where the challenge is. To AAP, I only have one thing to say, they should not indulge in this confrontational politics with the LG and Centre.”
