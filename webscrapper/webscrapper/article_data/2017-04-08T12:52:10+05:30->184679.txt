Singer-turned-designer   says being in the former pop girl group ' ' has given her a lot of opportunities to learn an "enormous amount" of things. 

 During an interview with a UK magazine, the 42-year-old star opens up about how her pop star beginnings played a role in building her fashion empire.
 
  
  
 "Being in the 'Spice Girls' was so much fun. I was never the best   or dancer. I learned an enormous amount during that time, though: the staging, the lighting, the costumes the package excited me,"   said. 
 
 "But I love fashion this is what I'm genuinely interested in... When I look back at my past self, (the way I dressed and behaved) was probably a sign of my insecurities. I feel quite confident in myself now getting older doesn't bother me."
