Imagine a gathering with the creme de la creme of  , socialites and industrialists in attendance. Throw in platters of good food, Mir���s witty banter, generous amounts of industry gossip and oodles of glamour. What you get is a truly epic party. And, why not? After all, it was The Times Food Awards 2017 ��� the showpiece event at ITC Sonar that celebrated the best of food and feted its creators on Thursday evening. 
The event kickstarted with the dapper   and the stunning   launching the   2017 ��� authored by Salmoli Mukerji ��� and conferring the prestigious awards on those who���ve kept us licking our fingers all year round. As the winners came up on stage to accept their awards, Mir, the host for the evening, had everyone laughing their heads off with his funny repartees. ���If you were to cook Jisshu a romantic lunch, what would you prepare?��� he asked an 
 unprepared Paoli. To which, the actress, taking one good look at the newly launched book in her hand, asked him back, ���This book doesn���t list the recipes, does it?��� Prosenjit Chatterjee too fell prey to Mir���s hilarious antics. When the actor confessed that he has not had ilish maach bhaja since years, Mir asked, ���What about kisses? Has the number gone down with years as well?���the banquet broke into fits of laughter. Once the honours for the best restaurants, confectioneries, chef, nightclubs and other categories were given out, guests made their way towards the lavish buffet laid out by the award-winning restaurants. 
 Later in the night, we caught Jisshu rushing towards the food counters (he was busy catching up industry friends over cocktails) and asked him if it���s a cheat day for him. ���My whole life is a cheat day. I���m looking forward to the biryani and the desserts.��� We also stumped onto Sayantika,   and Nusrat, the inseparable trio of the evening, having a lot fun. ���We never diet and we mean it when we say it,��� Mimi and   echoed, much to our surprise. Nusrat added, ���I look forward to this party every year. What could be a better party than one with unlimited food on offer?��� Touch�� to that. What a night it has been!
 Here are the best moments from the epic party...
