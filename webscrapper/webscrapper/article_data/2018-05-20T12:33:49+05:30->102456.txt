KANNUR: CPM general secretary Sitaram   called B S Yeddyurappa’s resignation as the chief minister of Karnataka “a victory of people’s power over BJP’s machinations” and said the CPM would not allow democracy to be hijacked.

 
 Inaugurating the E K Nayanar Memorial Academy Complex, at   on Saturday, he also slammed the BJP saying that the party has now perfected the art of forming governments after losing elections.
 
 The BJP has done so in states like Goa, Manipur and  . In Bihar, too the party came to power through backdoor, he said.
 
 “That is what they wanted to do in Karnataka as well. But the pressure and vigilance of the people of Karnataka did not allow horse trading to go on,” he said. The timely intervention of the   also helped, said Yechury. Incidentally, the figure 13 was somehow associated with the BJP, he said. Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s first government in Delhi lasted for 13 days and the second government led by him lasted for 13 months. In Karnataka, B S Yeddyurappa gave a 13-page-long resignation speech, he pointed out.
 
 The Karnataka victory has reinforced the CPM’s commitment to be in the forefront of resistance wherever there were attacks on the fundamental democratic rights of citizens, he added.
 
 Asserting that the priority was to oust the BJP from power, Yechury said every institution in the country has come under the party’s attack and that it was mounting an offence of unreason against reason. Even as the country was facing an assault on its democratic institutions, the Sangh Parivar has been trying to create communal polarization, he added.
 
 “We have been facing a formidable threat, which has to be defeated by people’s movements with alternative policy directions,” he said, adding that the CPM was the only party with an ideology that could offer an alternative policy direction.
