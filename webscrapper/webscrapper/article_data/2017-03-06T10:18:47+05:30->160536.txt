BENGALURU:   haphazardly, loud music, growing garbage dumps -- all these and more are common to some tony residential areas of Bengaluru, thanks to unbriddled commercialization of these localities. Annoyed by the impact of rampant commercialization, a petition titled, '  for a better Bengaluru', is being mobilized on change.org to be sent to chief minister Siddaramaiah. 

  The   and Bengaluru Residents' Associations' Confederation Ensemble (BRACE), the group spearheading the petition, said: "We are committed to supporting residents who are suffering from and fighting the negative fallout of rampant, unheeded and unbridled commercialization of legally designated residential zones." 
 
 Till Sunday afternoon, the petition, which describes this kind of wanton commercialization as a violation of of zoning regulations, garnered close to 1,900 supporters. The petition also points to a   judgement which said that there shall be no commercial activity allowed in residential main and residential mixed zones if abutting roads are 40-ft or less in width. 
 
  "Large scale conversions and illegal usage of land violate the right to life as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, inter alia, by causing pollution, threat to ecology and environment, stress and public inconvenience, and lack of peace and comfort," the petition reads. 
 
  It points out that after BRACE took up the matter, the   commissioner had issued public notices decreeing closure of commercial establishments in residential areas where road width didn't exceed 40-ft. But even after 6 weeks, corporation officials have failed to execute the order, it noted. 
 
  The petition urges political leaders and government officials to do their job, enforce the law and execute the orders of the BBMP and the high court on zoning regulations.
