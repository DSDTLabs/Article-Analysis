PATNA: The   in the state has drastically come down since chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) severed its 17-year-long coalition with the   in 2013.

  police records say 5,143 people were convicted between January and November, 2016. Among them, 21 were awarded death sentence, 1,410 life imprisonment, 479 got jail term for more than ten years and 1,377 less than ten years.
 
 Police records showed an upward trend in conviction since Nitish-led JD(U)-BJP coalition government was formed in November 2005. Altogether 6,839 people were convicted in 2006 and the figure increased up to 14,311 persons in 2010 with 37 capital punishments, the maximum in the last ten years, 1,875 life imprisonment and 640 jailed for more than ten years. A total of 9,853 people were convicted in 2007, including 39 capital punishments, 2,168 life imprisonment and 680 for more than ten years. In 2008, 12,007 people were convicted and 27 of them got death, 2,307 life term and 610 imprisoned for more than ten years. In 2009, 13,146 persons were convicted, including 12 death sentences, 1,824 life imprisonment and 375 jailed for more than ten years.
 
 But, soon after 2010, the conviction rate started declining with the same pace. The year 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 had 11,962, 10,346, 9,078, 5,073 and 4,513 convictions, respectively. 
 
 “The law enforcement agencies work efficiently when government is stable and there is no political turmoil. Political influence also hits the smooth functioning of enforcement agencies, affecting efficiency to deal with the law and order situation,” said a top IPS officer on the condition of anonymity.
 
 “The JD(U)-BJP coalition government ensured speedy trials in serious criminal cases and created fear among the criminals. But the government lost its focus after the coalition broke. We also had put efforts to ensure that witnesses deposed. That is not happening anymore,” said BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.
 
 However, JD(U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh blamed the BJP led central government for the poor conviction rates in the state and cited the shortage of judges as the main reason. “The recruitment of judges is being delayed by the central government and it was even pointed out by former Chief Justice of India T S Thakur,” he said.
