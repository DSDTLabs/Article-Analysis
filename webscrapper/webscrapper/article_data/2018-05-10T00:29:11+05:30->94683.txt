Jaipur: Activists who earlier tipped off the administration about child marriages in the state swung into action again with a warning about two weddings to be held in Banswara district. On Tuesday, activists wrote to the district magistrate, Banswara, attaching images of wedding invitation cards. The weddings were scheduled in Bildi village of Sajjangarh tehsil, Banswara, and in Abapura, on May 9 and 10.

 Activists of the National Campaign Committee for Eradication of Bonded Labour, a network spread across the nation and working to identify and free bonded labourers, alerted district authorities of the impending weddings.
 
 Banswara additional district collector Himmat Singh Barhat told TOI that both families had been counselled against proceeding with the weddings. “Instances of child marriage have declined drastically now, and even among the tribal population people wait for adulthood before marrying off their children. There are very few such instances now, and we rush with policemen when alerted of any impending wedding,” he said.
 
 Delhi-based Nirmal Gorana, who had received images of the invitation cards on WhatsApp said, “All four kids involved in the two weddings in Banswara on May 9 and 10 were minors. We managed to alert authorities, who swung into action.”
