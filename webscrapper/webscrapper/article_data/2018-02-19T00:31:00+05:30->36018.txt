Bengaluru: The number of young voters (18-19 years) in Karnataka has crossed the 15-lakh mark, which is double the number registered prior to the 2013 assembly polls. Karnataka chief electoral officer Sanjeev Kumar on Saturday said as per the draft electoral rolls of 2018, the number of young voters stood at 145.42 lakh as compared to 7.18 lakh in 2013. The number could go up a bit as still there’s time for inclusion of names in electoral rolls.  Kumar attributed this massive jump to various communication activities taken up by the election commission. “Of the 15.42 lakh voters, 7.72 lakh were enrolled during the special summary revision undertaken from November 30, 2017. During this period, we contacted 2 crore people,” he added. The number of women voters to every 1,000 men voters has also gone up significantly. While the electoral rolls in 2013 had 958 women, now the ratio has increased to 972:1,000. “We are in the process of identifying people with disabilities and enrol them as voters,” he added. Kumar released a logo for the assembly polls which has a Karnataka map in red and yellow colour with a tagline ‘Inclusive, Accessible, Ethical Election’.
