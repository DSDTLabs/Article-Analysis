The road-digging exercise has left several parts of the city in a mess. Problems abound in the form of huge pits, pollution, traffic jams and threat to commuters.

 The problems have aggravated because two major agencies — public works department and   — have failed to ensure that the contractors concerned repair the roads after the digging gets over.
 
 Several roads in Alambagh, Durgapuri, Singarnagar, Transportnagar and Amausi have been dug up by the Lucknow Electricty Supply Authority for laying of underground cables. “These lines are being laid for last six months. It’s difficult to walk on the sides, or run shops because of the deep pits and heavy layers of dust all around,” said  , a resident.
 
 A private telecom company, too, is carrying out road digging in many areas to upgrade the technology for high-speed internet.
 
 This apart, even LMC’s digging exercise has left people fuming. The corporation has been widening drains on the stretch from Sector 20 to D block in   for the last five months. The traffic moves on one side as the other side has been dug up.
 
 While commuters get stuck in snarls, residents complain of rising dust pollution. Parts of   and  , too, are in the same condition as the corporation is widening drains. The main market in Takrohi in Indiranagar has not been repaired for the past 10 years after Jal Nigam laid sewer lines there.
