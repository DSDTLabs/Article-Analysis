CHANDIGARH: Even though the   (NGT) has directed the   to take the city’s entire garbage to its waste processing plant and process it properly,   have stuck to their demand of shifting both the   and garbage processing plant from the existing spots.

 A few days back, the residents had blocked the entry of garbage carrying vehicles at the dumping site. They had lifted the blockade only after they were pacified by the MC officials.
 
 For the past many years, Dadumajra residents have claimed that the area has become a home to deadly diseases due to the presence of the dumping site and many people have lost their lives due to this problem. The residents had taken up the issue during the monthly general house meeting of the MC.
 
 Area councilor Farmila had also raised the issue during the general house meeting, urging the authorities to shift the dumping site. “We don’t want any other option. Just shift the garbage dumping site from Dadumajra so that residents can live in a healthy atmosphere,” she had asked the mayor.
 
 Not only Dadumajra, the surrounding areas including sectors 38, 38 (west), 37, 25, 24, 15 and Dhanas have been affected by the continuous stink and poor hygiene. Residents of these areas have raised voice against the same issue.
