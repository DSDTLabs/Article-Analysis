Wrestling star and actor   and actress   were spotted together for the first time since their split in April.

  
  
 The formerly engaged couple were photographed together as they went for coffee and a casual stroll through   on Saturday.
 
 According to a report, they were originally supposed to get married on May 5. 
 
 Following their dramatic breakup, Cena has been working hard to win Bella back. 
 
 During a interview, he said: "I still love  . I still would love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole." 
 
 Those remarks left Bella speechless. "Wow. Well, I'm speechless. That's crazy," she said.
