PANCHKULA: A week after the release of the central government's Swachh Sarvekshan survey, which ranked Panchkula at 211 in its list of India's cleanest cities, its MLA,  , launched a fresh tirade against mayor   at a press conference. 

 He accused Walia of messing up the affairs of the  , the Panchkula municipal corporation. He also said that her husband,  , a former president of the  , intimidates employees of the civic body. 
 
 Gupta also strongly advocated 'uniform' projects in the tricity, so that Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula develop together at the same pace.
 
 "Instead of owning up to her failures, Walia has now started blaming civic body officials and employees. Isn't it strange that she is neither able to work with staff nor officials?" Gupta asked. "As far as strenghtening the infrastructure and beautification of the city is concerned, she has hardly achieved any milestone."
