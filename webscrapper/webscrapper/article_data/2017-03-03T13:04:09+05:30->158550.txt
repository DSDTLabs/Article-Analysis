NAVI MUMBAI: After making numerous changes, the   standing committee passed the   on Thursday. 

 “For the first time, the standing committee had to scale down the estimates. The revised figure was based on previous year’s estimates and recoveries to set a realistic target,” said committee chairman  . The budget for 2017-18 fiscal has been scaled down to Rs 2,934.29 crore from the proposed Rs 2,999.47 crore after a cut of Rs 65.18 crore. 
 
 Civic chief  , who proposed the budget, was not allowed to speak and has rejected the changes. 
 
 The latter, too, required three meetings to come to a consensus. Sticking to their stance, the committee refused to sanction any tax revisions under the water, property or town planning segments.
 
 The committee has reallocated funds for the expenditure. Setting aside projects such as construction of flyovers and installing CCTVs, which were termed “unnecessary” as they may not happen too soon, the committee has made additional allocation for pending projects such as the Ambedkar Bhavan memorial, solar project, entry gates for villages. 
 
 “The committee has reduced the means of revenue and yet expects administration to undertake more development projects. I am against the changes made. The budget estimate presented by administration was based on research,” said Mundhe.
