Navi Mumbai: Motorists had a tough time on water-logged and pothole-ridden arterial and interior roads as heavy rains lashed the city on Tuesday. 

 Fresh craters have surfaced on various roads with Sion-Panvel highway, Uran road, MIDC service and internal roads in trans-Thane creek corridor and Taloja MIDC being the most affected among other roads.
 
 Subways and low lying areas were waterlogged resulting in traffic snarls. 
 
 Poor visibility added to residents’ woes. Five cases of tree fall were reported in various nodes. The city recorded the highest single day shower in the season with an average of 160mm   in the last 24 hours.
 
 It was a bumpy ride for motorists on internal nodal roads of Nerul, Shirwane, Vashi, Kharghar, Kamothe, Uran, Ulve, Kalamboli, Taloja, Airoli, Digha and Ghansoli. The Airoli T-junction connecting Mulund and Thane-Belapur Road near Rabale MIDC police station was submerged in knee-deep water whereas Vitawa and Mukand subways on Thane-Belapur Road were equally bad. 
 
 Two-wheelers had to take extra care while negotiating the pockmarked and waterlogged patches. 
 
 Sanjay Gauda, a Ghansoli resident and an eyewitness to one of the accidents on Tuesday, said, “A biker fell in a manhole between Gothivli and Rabale service road at around 1.30pm on Tuesday. Fortunately, he survived with minor injuries. The fellow motorists rushed him to a nearby hospital.” 
 
 Sources from the city body said, patch work would be carried out soon once the rain recedes and asphalting can be taken up after monsoon. 
 
 The Sion-Panvel Road at Turbhe Naka, Shirwane, Uran Phata-CBD pass flyover and Kopra Gaon developed fresh  , causing slowdown of vehicles. 
 
 Subways at Juninagar, Sanpada, Vashi, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli and Airoli were waterlogged during the morning peak hours. 
 
 Cidco nodes offered the motorists a tough ride. “On our insistence, Cidco started patch work recently at various nodes,” said Panvel civic commissioner Dr Sudhakar Shinde.
