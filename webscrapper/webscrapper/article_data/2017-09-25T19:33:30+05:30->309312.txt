AGRA:   (AMU) appointed a new “provost” for Sir Syed North hall on Monday after students staged a protest on Sunday night by banging meal plates and spoons at the VC lodge to protest against the “poor” quality of food being served in the hostel.

 According to student leader,  , the cost of dining has increased by Rs 100 per student, from Rs 1000 in the last academic session to Rs 1100 in this, but the quality of food has gone from bad to worse. “We had complained many times regarding the quality of food but no one paid heed to our requests,” he said.
 
 “We were helpless so we had to protest yesterday in front of VC lodge with “roti and dal” to show him the quality and demanded the removal of provost,” said Imran adding that we just want proper food to eat.
 
 According to other students, not only food quality has gone down but the deficit charges have been increased from Rs 250 to Rs 300 per student. He said, if food has been served to more than the prescribed number of students in the dining hall, the extra amount (deficit)has been charged from students by dividing the costs among them.
 
 When contacted, registrar of the university, Prof  , said that the new provost, Prof Udai Dulla Bukhari, is a professor in Computer Science department. He said, the outgoing provost,   has not been well for some time and that could be the reason for some laxity in food quality.
 
 He admitted that the bills for dining have increased due to escalating cost food items but the administration is ensuring to provide good quality.
