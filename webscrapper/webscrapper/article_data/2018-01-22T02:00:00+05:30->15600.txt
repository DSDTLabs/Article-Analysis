PATNA: A Bihar Military Police (BMP) jawan allegedly tried to commit suicide by shooting himself with his INSAS rifle at a sentry post on the premises of chief minister Nitish Kumarâ€™s official residence at 1, Anne Marg under Sachiwalaya police late on Saturday night. The jawan of Gorkha battalion, Puran Gurung (28), is undergoing treatment at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). 

 Sources said no one heard the sound of firing as INSAS rifle makes less noise. The matter came to light only after another BJP jawan reached the sentry post around 10pm and spotted Gurung lying in a pool of blood. He was immediately rushed to PMCH. SHO of Sachivalaya police station R K Bhaskar said police were waiting for Gurung to recover so that his statement could be recorded.
 
 Sources said Gurung was facing financial crisis and his wife, a teacher, had reached the city from Darjeeling in West Bengal recently. He had joined BMP 16 years ago.
