BENGALURU: The 63rd additional   on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of  , who has been arrested in an attempt-to-murder case.

 This is the second time that the court has turned down the bail petition of Nalapad, who was arrested along with six of his associates for allegedly attacking 24-year-old Vidvat L in an upscale restaurant in UB City on February 17. The Karnataka high court too had rejected his bail plea on March 14, terming the attack brutal.
 
 Nalapad spent his 100th day in Central Prison ( ) on Wednesday. He was brought to the jail on February 20. 
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, P Usman, advocate for Nalapad, had argued that his client should be granted bail as police have already submitted the chargesheet in the case. “My client has been in jail for more than 90 days and investigation is over. The court should consider granting bail,” he had said.
 
 Special public prosecutor Shyam Sundar had opposed the bail plea arguing that the accused is an influential person and could destroy evidence. “Filing of the chargesheet and spending more than 90 days in prison don’t entitle the accused for bail,” he had said.
 
 Speaking to media outside the court on Wednesday, Sundar said the judge upheld his arguments on chances of the accused destroying evidence as he was an influential person.
