CHENNAI: If the city's suburban network were a rake, it would appear that it had suddenly hit a railroad switch to a busier line. Bucking a trend over the past two financial years, the transit system recorded an increase of 35 lakh commuters in 2016-17.

 From 38.69 crore passengers in 2015-16, the suburban system recorded 39.04 crore suburban commuters in 2016-17, the Chennai division of   said.
 
 This led to a `71-crore (4%) increase in passenger turnover. Officials attributed this to an upswing in reserved passengers, stringent ticket checks, the addition of 51crosssector services, and increased migration of people to developing areas in the suburbs.
 
 The numbers are likely to increase further, as the division has completed extension of platforms on the ChennaiArakkonam and ChennaiGummidipoondi sections so they can operate 12-car trains.The railways has to complete similar platform extensions only in the Senjipanampakkam and Korukkupet stations.The division uses nine-car rakes now, which leads to overcrowding.
 
 There was an increase of 10 lakh reserved passengers in 2016-17 over the previous year, a surge that officials said was a result of the division operating 2,098 special trains, a 16.36% a rise from the 2015-16 fiscal.
 
 The increase on the passenger front was, however, undone by a fall in freight income.The division's overall revenue in 2016-17 was down by `150 crore from the `3,458.25 crore of 2015-16 because of a 13% drop in revenue from freight. Officials said this was because of a fall of 27.5% in coal consignments and 54.5% in iron and steel cargo.
 
 Divisional railway manager, Chennai, Anupam   on Thursday said Southern Railway's focus will be to improve passenger amenities and develop infrastructure. This includes recent improvement work on platforms, opening pay-to-use toilets in all suburban stations and construction of platform shelters.
 
 Southern Railway is also taking efforts to improve the punctuality of trains, Sharma said.   train punctuality increased from 87.2% to 89.7% and suburban trains were on schedule 90% of the time in the last three months of the financial year, up from 80%.
 
 He said Southern Railway had improved safety measures over the past financial year, installing 124 security cameras in five stations and ensuring that entire platforms and concourse areas of these stations are covered.
