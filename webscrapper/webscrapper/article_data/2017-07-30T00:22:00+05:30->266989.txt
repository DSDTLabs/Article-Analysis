Bhopal: Rainfall this year may not have been as heavy as last year, but Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) emergency cell set up to assist in monsoon-related emergencies is buzzing with calls for help. Over 130 complaints have been received by the emergency cell of the civic body, said BMC official Iftekar Khan. Operating at a makeshift and dilapidated office opposite Sadar Manzil, the cramped centre is proving to be lifeline for many. “Complaints are primarily from low lying areas like Cholla, Khajuri Kalan and Karond. However till now, we have not been forced to use water pumps in these places,” said Khan. 

 Last year too, the emergency centre was flooded with complaints. Helpline calls are mostly related to choking of sewage lines , tree felling or old houses caving in. There was a reported ceiling wall collapse near New Market, but no one was injured.
 
 However, not all residents are satisfied with functioning of the BMC. “We have approached mayor Alok Sharma and senior officials to resolve issue of waterlogging near old Safia college, but nothing has been done yet,” said Shafiq, a local businessman. The approach road has been flooded to over three days. The knee high water makes it impossible for people to cross the road that connects Safia college to Hamidia road. 
 
 Delayed construction civic work by the BMC and other agencies has also added to citizens’ woes. Many are blaming the BMC for poor planning and construction. A newly constructed drain in New Market caved in within 24 hours of it being constructed. “The road in the area was repaired just ahead of the monsoon. Soon after, the BMC started laying its pipelines. Cable and telecom operators also dug up the road,” said a Moti Masjid resident. “The condition is pathetic, as potholes are leading to frequent accidents in the locality,” he added.
