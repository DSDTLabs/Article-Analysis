Panaji: Velsao beach, which is a favourite spot among picnickers, has also been attracting a lot of stray   owing to food visitors leave behind. 

 The stray dog problem in the state is not just a nuisance but can pose a potential rabies threat to the general public. “We’ve never had a stray dog problem until recently,” said Anthony Rodrigues of the Velsao panchayat.
 
 To counter this, they have availed of the government’s small animal rescue scheme aimed at capturing strays and sterilizing them before releasing them into their domain. All civic bodies who have signed MoUs with animal welfare organisations are eligible for the scheme. 
 
 So far, however, just 10 panchayats and one municipality have been granted funds under this scheme while the animal welfare organisation, People for Animals (PFA), has been roped in by the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) to implement this scheme at the various civic bodies.
 
 A total of Rs 75.4 lakh has been granted to civic bodies under this scheme this year. The annual budget for the same is Rs 2 crore.
