Last year in September, six gates of the dam had to be opened to release the overflowing water. 

 According to sources, the main catchment area of Bisalpur Dam is Bhilwara and Chittorgarh. 
 
 "It doesn't matter if Ajmer and Jaipur have good rains but if the rain is less in Bhilwara and Chittorgarh region, it would mean that Bisalpur will not get water," said an official. He added that even 311.95 metres of water in the dam is enough for the supply for next one year but the department always wishes that the dam remains filled to the brim.
 
 Last year, in the month of June, the water level in Bisalpur Dam had gone down to 310.30 metres. Even supply to Jaipur has been increased to 600 MLD per day which was nearly 400 MLD last year. 
 
 Officials said that they can draw drinking water from the dam till it has up to 299 metres of water. In current circumstances, the dam has enough water for both Jaipur and Ajmer. 
 
 This is because the fourth well was started last year and Ajmer is getting good amount of water. "Before last year, Ajmer was getting an average of 140 MLD water per day, but now it is getting 250 MLD per day and many times up to 300 MLD," added officials.
 
 Officials are hopeful that in the second or third spell of rains, Bisalpur will again overflow.
