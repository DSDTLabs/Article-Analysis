Kokata: Facing the heat of enquiry into the police presence in the air traffic control building in Kolkata last week by the civil aviation ministry despite an alert to prevent unauthorized entry into the sensitive zone to CISF a couple of weeks ago, the paramilitary force and Bidhannagar Police have claimed that the cops, including a female officer, had gone to the 3rd floor and not 7th floor of the building, where the tower is situated.

 Airport officials, though, said the claim was not tenable as monitoring of flights, including permission to land, was done from the area control situated in the 3rd floor of the air traffic services buildi-ng next to the old domestic te-rminal. The tower merely ha-ndles flights just before touc-hdown till just after takeoff.
 
 A CISF officer said the police had impressed upon Airports Authority of India officials to allow their entry into the building. “Technically, entry of cops into the building wasn’t unauthorized as they got permission from local AAI officials. But they were very much present in the place that matters. They were sitting right in the nerve centre, not some obscure room in the building. Everyone is trying to save their skin by saying th-ey were in the 3rd floor and not the 7th,” a source added.
 
 DCP (airport) Bhaskar Mukherjee refused to comment on the issue. Civil aviation ministry sources, though, said AAI was seriously probing the incident following minister of state Jayant Sinha’s query.
