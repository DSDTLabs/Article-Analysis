 Haryana housing minister   said on Sunday that chief minister   had approved a new affordable housing policy to provide cheaper houses to people of small urban areas, especially in the old city boundaries of the state. This would provide affordable houses to people near their workplaces. Jain further said the state government had formulated the policy for old cities within the jurisdiction of urban local bodies, to which the chief minister had accorded his approval. She added that although there was already a plan for setting up of sectors in urban areas by the Town and  , there was no such plan for old cities in urban areas.
