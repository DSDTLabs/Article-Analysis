NAGPUR: The three-day Pt CR   is all set to provide a musical treat to city audience. Raising the bar in terms of artistes and also the venue, the festival will be held at   6.30pm from February 8 to 10.

 Opening with a vocal performance by  , a disciple of Pt Vyas, the second presentation will be a sitar recital by  . 
 
 With its tradition of providing stage to upcoming artistes too, the second day will have flautists Parasnath brothers who will be performing in the city for the first time. The audience will get to enjoy the singing of renowned classical vocalist Ashwini Bhide Deshpande on the same day. 
 
 The final day performances include vocal by   and santoor recital by Pt Satish Vyas, who organizes the festival at Nagpur every year in memory of his father.
 
 “The concept entails providing a stage to senior artistes who require bigger platform. Kalpana Zokarkar has been singing wonderfully and so I wanted more listeners to enjoy her renditions,” Pt Vyas says. 
 
 Commenting on the change in venue, the musician added, “We tried to get Deshpande hall last year too but it was not available. I booked it in time this year and have set a line-up of some of the finest names in Hindustani classical music for this festival.” 
 
 Organizing such festivals in smaller cities like Nagpur help in giving a fillip to local organizations like Saptak which get associated with it, feels Vyas. “Smaller cities do not have the financial backing to host big names. My attempt through this festival is to make this happen,” he adds.
