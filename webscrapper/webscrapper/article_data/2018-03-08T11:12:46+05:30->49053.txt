CHENNAI: Actor-turned politician   on Tuesday asked students to be vigilant about the prevailing politics and said he would leave a better   behind.

 Speaking after inaugurating the annual cultural fest -- Instincts 2018 – at SSN College here, Kamal said, “I want you students to move Tamil Nadu forward. Be vigilant about the prevailing politics. Please vote without fail. Only because many people like us kept away from voting booths we are in this dire state today.”
 
 The actor said his newly launched party --   -- was “looking for people like you.” “Bring your ideas to us. We will listen to you and learn from you,” he said.
 
 “You are the centre of universe. Maiam (centre) is like the needle of the weighing scale. Maiam is the position of the judge. We will take sides after observing from the centre which side is the best. Being at maiam helps us judge better. Being at the maiam is like being honest. It requires effort and enthusiasm” he said.
 
 He said, “I am going to die in your service. I will leave a better Tamil Nadu behind.” 
 
 He told students to enjoy the college days. “You will not get this happiness in life again. Enjoy your freedom on the campus with responsibility. When you leave the campus, you will lead me. Naalai namathe (Tomorrow is ours),” Kamal said.
