NEW DELHI: A sedate hearing on the 70-year-old litigation over ownership of the 2.77 acres disputed land in   in the   suddenly came alive with senior advocate   characteristically infusing belligerence into it. 

  No sooner did senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for the 'Ram Lalla' deity, suggest exchange of synopsis of line of argument between parties, Dhavan, who appeared for lead petitioner M Siddiq, loudly repelled the suggestion. "I am going to start the arguments the way I want to in the case which is not only important for India but for the world. Seeking advance synopsis on line of argument is wrong, a hundred times wrong." 
 
 Dhavan's belligerence during the hearing on December 5 had invited caustic comments from the bench headed by   Dipak Misra. 
 
 Dhavan's eruption left Vaidyanathan stunned and the bench perplexed. Dhavan wanted to know whether the parties would get an uninterrupted hearing before the bench on a day to day basis given the present practice of truncated daily hearing by a constitution bench in the Aadhaar case.
 
  The CJI said the hearing of other matters was important as these were poor persons who had been awaiting compensation in car accidents. "There are 700 cases of poor litigants pending. Even half an hour is good enough for them to get succour," the CJI said.
