NEW DELHI:   president   on Friday said that HC’s decision to refer the case of the disqualification of 20   MLAs back to   was “unique proof” of the independence of the judiciary and freedom in Indian democracy. 

 Tiwari appealed to the election commission to hold a proper re-hearing. “We welcome the directions of the high court. EC should definitely give a proper re-hearing to the MLAs but, simultaneously, we should note that the high court has not absolved the MLAs of being beneficiaries of offices of profit,” Tiwari said. 
 
 Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta said   had only given temporary relief to the MLAs. “We welcome HC’s decision. However, the MLAs have not been cleared yet,” Gupta said.
 
 Gupta claimed that EC had already held 11 hearings, but the MLAs “ignored it completely”. The high court had not questioned the President’s order in the case, he claimed.
 
 Gupta said AAP had levelled serious charges against EC and it was unfortunate that the party was “playing politics over the issue of office of profit”. He said the party should not “cross boundaries”.
