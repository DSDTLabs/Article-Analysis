CHENNAI: The   on Wednesday reserved its orders on a writ appeal filed by India Cements Limited (ICL) challenging an earlier order by a single judge who dismissed their petition seeking to stay the operation of a notice issued by Enforcement Directorate in connection with the transaction of a franchise amount when IPL was held in South Africa. 

 The division bench of Justice KK Sasidharan and Justice R Subramanian reserved its orders to a further date. The issue pertains to allegation of infraction of the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act ( ) by the ICL authorities when IPL was held in South africa in 2009. 
 
 ICL which was a franchisee voiced its concern about the change of venue and to alleviate the concerns and costs of change in venue, the BCCI agreed to support the franchisees with regard to additional expenses to be incurred by them.
 
 The counsel for ICL submitted that ICL was not aware that amounts that were expended by Cricket South Africa (CSA) would result in a corresponding reduction in the Central Rights Fee payable by the BCCI to it. Again, in the normal course of a tournament played in India no such expenses would have been incurred at all and no amount was paid by the BCCI to CSA on behalf of ICL. Hence, there are no contraventions of FEMA.
