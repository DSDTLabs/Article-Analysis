PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare has ordered a departmental inquiry against veterinary officer Satish Gore for the unsatisfactory justification he provided and based on the conclusions of the two-member inquiry committee into the snake deaths at the civic-run Bahinabai Chaudhary Zoo in Akurdi.

 Speaking with TOI, assistant commissioner and chief of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s ( ) administration department   confirmed that Waghmare had directed a departmental inquiry against Gore.
 
 The committee was instituted after a corporator and other organisations registered complaints. Through its report in December, the committee brought to notice serious lacunae in the working of the veterinary officer. Gore had sought allowance from PCMC although he is not eligible for it. He hadn’t nullified the objections raised in the department’s audit report nor had he resolved the complaints on the   helpline immediately.
 
 Gore stated, “I have not received the order of the departmental inquiry so I cannot comment on it.”
 
 On November 20, snake rescuers had brought to light that, of the 50-60 rescued snakes, around two dozen had died and were kept in sacks and jars in the verandah of a store room in the zoo. There was also a severely foul smell emanating from the store room. 
 
 According to the rescuers, venomous and non-venomous snakes had been kept together in the sacks, which was a violation of   (CZAI) rules. The act had resulted in the death of the non-venomous snakes. The municipal commissioner had directed medical officer of health Anil Roy to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report.
