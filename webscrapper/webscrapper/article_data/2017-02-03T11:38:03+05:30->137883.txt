KOLHAPUR: Thousands of devotees visiting the Mahalaxmi temple for   were left disappointed as the sun rays failed to reach the face of the deity on the final day of the festival. The three-day fest began on January 31.

 One the first day, the sun rays reached the waist of the deity and on the second day as well the story remained the same. The third day too was nothing but disappointing as the sun rays were only able to reach to the feet of the deity.
 
 “I attended the festival for last two days. I was very happy that the rays reached the waist of the deity on Day 2 of the festival. I was expecting that the rays will reach the face of the deity on the last day, but it did not happen. This has been happing for many years now. The administration should take some concrete measures so that the essence of the festival remains intact,” said a devotee.
 
 K G Hiraskar, professor at   (KIT) and member of Kiranotsav Marg Nischitikaran Samiti, said, “This is a regular phenomenon since the past many years. We have already removed temporary obstacles. Therefore, the rays were able to reach up to the waist. The high rise buildings have caused to divert the angle of the rays falling on the face of deity. We will soon submit our report to the Town Planning (TP) department of   Municipal Corporation.”
 
 Another member of committee and environmental activist   said, “As the sun has started its movement from south to north, intensity of rays were not strong. If we remove physical obstacles, the festival will be successful.”
