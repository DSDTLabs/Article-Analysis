Trichy: Criticising the central government for delaying the formation of the Cauvery management board, VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan demanded the resignation of the 50 MPs of AIADMK to give pressure on the central government, here on Friday. 

 “They should resign so that it will become a constitutional crisis. Instead, their plan to protest with the support of the people will be farcical,” Thirumavalavan told the reporters at Trichy international airport today.
 
 Thiruma also said that with few days left for the formation of the cauvery management board, a central minister openly expressed their inability to form the board. It was decided at the all-party meeting that a representation will be given to the prime minister. But it was not implemented.
 
 “All party delegation should meet either the water resource minister or the president immediately,” he said.
 
 Thirumavalavan seconded the statement of the opposition leader MK Stalin that the contempt of court proceedings should be filed against the central government if the CMB was not formed within the time frame given by the Supreme Court.
 
 Citing the suicides of policemen due to the pressure from the higher officials, he demanded to constitute association for police in Tamil Nadu.
