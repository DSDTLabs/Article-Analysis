 who plays the heroine in a   film, says it was a childhood dream to work with the director. Incidentally, it was Manisha Koirala’s performance in  , that drew Aditi towards Ratnam’s brand of cinema. She says, “The first Mani Ratnam film I saw was Bombay. I used to watch   on screen and I would tell myself, ‘One day, I want to be there’. Even though I was a child, the film moved me in a way, which I couldn’t explain then, but it stayed with me forever. I am one of those actors who believes that a film essentially belongs to a director.”
