Pune: Officials of the Controller of Legal Metrology, Pune district, said on Sunday that they have not received any complaints about   of fuel dispensing machines at petrol pumps in their jurisdiction this year, so far.

 On Thursday, a special task force of the Uttar Pradesh police raided over a dozen petrol pumps in Lucknow. They found that the owners of these pumps had inserted a chip-like device in their dispensing machines to dupe consumers.
 
 Assistant controller of Legal Metrology, Pune district, SM Mahajan, said, “We have not received any complaint in this regard in our jurisdiction this year, so far. We conduct   inspections regularly. An inspector rank officer with concerned petrol company dealer carries out the inspection at petrol pumps. During the inspection, they check petrol pump meter’s circuit and dispensing machine too. As many as five such inspections are carried out in a year in the district, including Pune.”
 
 However, an inspector rank official said the possibility of meter tampering cannot be ruled out at petrol pumps in the rural areas. “Though, we have not come across any such cases in our jurisdiction, the petrol pumps in the rural areas need to be checked thoroughly,” he said.
 
 All India Petrol Dealers’ Association (AIPDA) spokesperson Ali Daruwala said, “All the dealers registered with AIPDA are aware that if they are found indulging in such activities (tampering of fuel dispensing machines), their licences will be terminated.” He added that the association has called for a meeting to discuss various issues related to petrol pumps on May 6 in New Delhi.
 
 “In this meeting, all issues related to petrol pumps, including tampering of meters, will be discussed in detail,” Daruwala said.
