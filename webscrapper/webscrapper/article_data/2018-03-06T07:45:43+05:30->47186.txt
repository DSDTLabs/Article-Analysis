AHMEDABAD:   on Monday quashed two contracts awarded by the   (AMC) for supply of   to two companies situated outside Gujarat.

 A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje held that AMC had accepted tenders of two companies from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in violation of the state government’s purchase policy.
 
 In this case, AMC had awarded the contract for supply of bandage rolls and gauze cloth for its hospitals to two companies situated outside Gujarat. 
 
 One of the suppliers who had bid for the contract raised objection on the ground that awarding contract to the companies situation outside the state is in violation of the state purchase policy.
 
 A government resolution issued on June 3, 2016 specifically mentioned 188 items for hospital use that the local authorities must buy from MSMEs located in Gujarat. 
 
 If any authority wants to procure goods from outside the state, it has to obtain an approval from the State Purchase Committee (SPC) by justifying the ground of quality and rate. AMC awarded the contract without getting any prior approval from the SPC.
 
 The supply contract was challenged by one Bharat Patel and the HC allowed his petition, quashed the contract and ordered for issuing the tenders again by May 31. The judges quashed the contract but have permitted the supply till May 31 so that medical services in AMC hospitals do not get affected, said petitioner’s advocate Bhargavi Thakar.
