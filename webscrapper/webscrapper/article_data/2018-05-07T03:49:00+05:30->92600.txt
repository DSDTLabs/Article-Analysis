Margao: Residents of   demanded that the Regional Plan (RP) 2021 as well as the central government’s recent ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme be immediately scrapped at the gram sabha held on Sunday.

 “People are furious with the government’s plan of giving heritage monuments and institutions in the hands of corporate firms. A resolution was moved opposing the scheme, as well as that of river nationalisation. They also want a special meeting to be convened to discuss the proposal to levy a tax of Rs 1,000 on only the small and medium hotels and not the starred resorts in this village,” former sarpanch Edwin Barreto told TOI.
 
 “Members have also objected to the new CRZ (coastal regulation zone) draft policy kept for scrutiny and demanded that a special gram sabha be summoned to deliberate upon this since almost 80% of the village lies under CRZ norms. The special gram sabha will be held this month,” Cavelossim sarpanch Denis Dias.
 
 The annual budget of Rs 1.8 crore, along with the annual accounts and annual plan were approved at the meet. Other issues discussed were the blocking of footpath access in some wards. The sarpanch informed the members that pre-monsoon works have already commenced.
