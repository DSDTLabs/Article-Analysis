AHMEDABAD:   on the street, being stared at and groped and having vulgar comments passed in public places are experiences most women relate to. 

 Questioning practices that instil a sense of fear and vulnerability among women, an intersectional group of individuals participated in the  , ‘I Will Go Out’ (IWGO), held in the city on Saturday. The march was part of a nationwide movement – IWGO – held across 20 Indian cities.
 
  According to   data, more than 1,000 cases of rape and sexual harassment were reported in Gujarat in 2015. Seeking to make public spaces safer, more than 100 participants were part of the march here. “Several minority communities also face the same sense of diffidence that women face, when it comes roaming around freely. It never goes without being judged or constant questioning. The fight against patriarchy is thus intersectional,” said  , who started the online community for queer persons and allies last year.
 
 Members of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer Intersex Asexual (LGBTQIA) community also participated in the march because they relate to the discrimination and faced by women. “As a member of the LGBTQIA community, I empathize with women because the issues faced by our community are no different. Even if she has to sit in her balcony, she’d have to watch how she dresses and conducts herself for the fear of being judged,” said  , a 43-year-old design consultant.
 
 “Lack of proper sex education is largely responsible for the inherent discrimination and lack of acceptance among people. They are not taught what a ‘safe touch’ is and what isn’t. If these things aren’t taught or even discussed openly among families, issues are bound to arise,” added Shah.
