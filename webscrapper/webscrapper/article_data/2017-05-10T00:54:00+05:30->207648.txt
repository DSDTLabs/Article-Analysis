Belagavi: In a fiercely competitive age, there is immense pressure on students to excel academically. However, remaining glued to textbooks can become a monotonous experience. In a bid to make learning more engaging and enjoyable, Shrikant Latkar of Belagavi has developed a micro gaming-cum-learning platform that is available across domains – web, Android and iOS.

 The first member of his family to become an engineer, Latkar started Oust Labs in the city in 2015 to help students prepare for entrance examinations for admission into reputed institutions. Latkar, who boasts of more than two decades’ experience at BPL’s research and development centre and multinational corporations such as Motorola among others, sought to combine learning with an element of competition that a game invoked.
 
 In the past two years, Oust Labs, which initially got seed-funding from Infosys, has expanded its operations to other cities too, making its presence felt in Bengaluru, Pune and the US. The startup is offering its platform and application to a host of educational institutions, and companies.
 
 “We want to ensure that every idle moment is turned into a fun-learning moment for people. Imagine a world where you can learn anything in just a moment. At Oust Labs, we want to make the learning process simple, effective and engaging,” said Latkar, adding that his company’s app was available in multiple Indian languages.
 
 Institute of Management Education and Research (IMER), Belagavi, is among the institutions to have taken to Oust Labs’ platform. IMER governing council chairman Raj Belgaonkar said, “While educational institutions have been dissuading students from using mobile phones, Oust devised a platform that could drive learning. We think this is a great innovation in the field of learning. Why ban mobile phones when they can become tools of learning?”
