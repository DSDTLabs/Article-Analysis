BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha assembly remained paralysed after question hour on Tuesday as   legislators demanded a response from the state government on the minimum support price (MSP) of tomatoes, which they termed as very low. 

 Raising the issue during Zero Hour, opposition whip   drew speaker  's attention to an incident on Monday in which several farmers in Keonjhar district destroyed around two quintal of their produce in front of the district collector's office in protest against the low MSP. 
 
 Joined by his colleagues in the Congress,   urged the speaker to give a ruling for a reply on the issue and jumped into the well of the house. Speaking to reporters outside the assembly, Bahinipati blamed the Centre and the state government for the situation. "Ever since demonetization, the vegetable price never picked up. Moreover, the state's failure to create enough storage space is forcing the farmers to spoil the vegetables," he said.
 
 The BJP has blamed the government. "It is deplorable the government has not prioritised this," BJP MLA Pradip Purohit said. 
 
  "The government is sensitive towards the loss of farmers. The matter will be taken up at the appropriate level in the government to prevent farmers' loss," said BJD farmers' cell convenor Sushant Singh.
