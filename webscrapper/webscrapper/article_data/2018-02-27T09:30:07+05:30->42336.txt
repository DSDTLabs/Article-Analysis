SAVADATTI (BELAGAVI): Driving from Ramdurg to Savadatti, 87km from Belagavi,   president   spotted a lone farmhouse and an entire family working in a sugarcane field.

 He immediately stopped his car and proceeded towards the field to talk to the farmer, at Chilmur cross in Sunnal village, Ramdurg taluk. Bhimappa and Ramakka Mayannavar, the farmer couple, were taken aback to see   and a big group of Congress workers walking into their field.
 
 Rahul discussed the loan waiver and other schemes of the state government with Mayannavar and also asked how government schemes are reaching farmers.
 
 Mayannavar wanted to gift Rahul a lamb, but security personnel did not allow it.
 
 Addressing a Congress convention in Savadatti, Rahul said former defence minister Manohar Parrikar was “busy buying fish in Goa, when PM Narendra Modi changed the Rafale deal contract in Paris”. The contract was signed during the UPA government, and was altered without being brought to the knowledge of then defence minister Parrikar.
 
 “Modi snatched the contract from   based HAL and gave it to his close friend, who’s never had any experience manufacturing battle planes,” he added.
 
 “We have questioned the reason behind changing the contact by increasing rates, even without getting a nod of the cabinet committee on security, but never got a reply,” Rahul said.
