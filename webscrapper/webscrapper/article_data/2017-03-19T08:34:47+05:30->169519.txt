BENGALURU: The revised transferable development right ( ) policy announced recently by the Karnataka government is likely to ensure equitable spread of development in Bengaluru.

 Introduced in 2010 by the then   government, TDR was envisaged to help the government save money on land acquisition and ensure monetary compensation for those who lost their property. The land loser can either develop the land or sell it to any developer who needs additional floor space index (FSI). However, owing to opacity of the rules, the TDR market has failed to take off.
 
 The   aims to make TDR attractive and foolproof as it envisages granting additional construction rights to builders, depending on the width of the road alongside a project site. No extra construction benefits in the form of TDR will be provided for projects on roads less than 9 metres wide.
 
 “Under the new rule, we have removed the zoning classification and linked it to guidance value. If the TDR is generated in, for example on MG Road, its buyer can use it for developing a property north of Bengaluru, say in Yelahanka, which will fetch him/her twice or thrice the value than if he/she wants it to use in the same area. The older policy worked in reverse direction, leading to more congestion and unplanned growth,’’ urban development secretary   said.
 
 “This is a very positive move. The earlier position of differentiation based on zones did not allow easy transfer of TDR rights. This one, based on guideline values, will be of more equitable valuation and hence easier to sell,”  , managing director, Value Designbuild, said.
 
 C N Govindaraju, managing director, Vaishnavi Group, said he was impressed with the clarity provided on the setbacks. “The draft policy clarifies how a builder should apply TDR and this enables a much clearer understanding and interpretation thereof. While the old policy provided for use of development right to the extent of 1.5 times the land surrendered, the new one proposes to increase this to two times. The old policy limited the benefit only against the land acquired while the new regulation takes into consideration the building demolished and compensates for it. This is a progressive move,’’ he added.
 
 But many large developers, including Credai, are not impressed as they feel the new policy will devalue old TDR rights and make it unattractive in the long run. The BBMP had so far issued around 1 crore sqft of TDR for land losers in lieu of land for taking up development project. This includes the Mysuru royal family which has been granted roughly around 25,000 sqft of TDR for the widening of Ballari and Jayamahal roads.
 
 “When rules are made, they should address future actions and not retrospective. Many existing plans based on old TDR will become redundant since they have to again get their certificates authenticated with guidance rate. This will devalue their hard earned rights. The new TDR rules will send a wrong signal to the market and make it unattractive in future,’’ Suresh Hari, secretary, Credai, said.
 
 The government went back on its promise to raise the TDR and make it attractive fearing payment of higher compensation to old TDR holders, especially the Mysuru royal family

 There is scope for further improvement in the TDR rules with perspective to monetary consideration taken of the area instead of the zoning rules. The scenario looks good and it will bring in more revenues. The earlier A, B, C zones are now on monetary consideration which helps the government raise more revenues. We can get total clarity only once we know the mechanism of how it will work. For a few, however it may mean loss of value
