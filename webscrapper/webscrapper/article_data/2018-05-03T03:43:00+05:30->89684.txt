Mapusa: Former union law minister Ramakant   lashed out at the government on Wednesday stating that the three-member cabinet advisory committee does not have any basis. Addressing reporters at the North Goa Pradesh Congress Committee office in Mapusa, Khalap said, “When there is no CM for the state, what is the point in having a cabinet advisory committee? This is a constitutional crisis. Does Goa deserve such a setup? We demand that such a structure be removed and there be a CM to run the state.” He added that,“It is a disgrace for the party and the leaders, and this kind of a setup is totally unacceptable in any democratic world.” tnn
