KOLKATA: They might not be as slick as the automated boom barriers that open and close in sync with traffic signals, but recent experiments with the manually-operated drop gates — resembling railway level crossing — have convinced Lalbazar officials that the cheaper variety might be the only solution at crossings that handle huge pedestrian movement.

 
  
 
 Weeks after a drop gate was installed under the   flyover on Strand Road, traffic officials have decided to install them at other spots in and around central Kolkata. Two more of these have been installed at the   crossing and   crossing. DC (traffic)   said the use of drop gates has been encouraging.
 
 “While you do need a personnel to operate them, there is no question of them breaking down. They also do not follow a fixed time cycle like boom barriers, so they can be operated when there is pedestrian pressure,” said an officer. They are also useful in areas like   where three wheelers like vans and tempos take up huge road space and slow down traffic movement on arterial roads as they flout signals.
 
 Traffic department officials, however, claimed that such solution has been planned only in areas where pedestrians outnumber or are equal to the number of vehicles crossing the spot at a given point of time. For vehicle intensive crossings, the cops will still depend on boom barriers.
 
 “Initially, there were some minor glitches with synchronisation but they were fixed soon. The Howrah traffic guard has adopted to the gate well. We will continue the trial run as part of sensitization for some more time. The teething troubles should also be fixed in due course,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.
 
 Police will plug the small gaps through which the pedestrians are sneaking past and start prosecuting jaywalkers.
