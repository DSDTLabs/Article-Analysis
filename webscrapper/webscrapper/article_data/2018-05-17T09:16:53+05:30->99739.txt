VIJAYAWADA: With a view to tapping the potential of   children, Andhra Pradesh State Creativity and Culture Commission, along with the Cultural Centre of   and Amaravati, started a five-day   arts, crafts, creative writing and storytelling workshop here on Wednesday.

 Around 30 street kids, mostly orphans from Sri Krishna Chaitanya Vidya Vihar Children’s Trust (SKCV), attended the   which started with dry brush and pencil drawing sessions. Most of the kids have spent days in Vijayawada railway station and other public places before they were rescued and rehabilited at SKCV. The state government is organising the camp as part of their programme to encourage creative thinking among street kids.
 
 A Pavan Kumar, who cleared SSC examinations with 9.0 score, said, “I attended the first day of the camp. It is thoroughly enjoyable. It will help us raise our creative skills. Learning new things are always interesting. A number of factors forced me to leave my family, but I'm happy that I'm getting love and care just as other children,” he said.
 
 K Anjali, who is studying intermediate vocational course at SKCV Amodini Campus, said many streets kids want to enjoy summer vacations and such camps help them do so. SKCV Foundation functionary Dr   said love and affection can help street kids.
 
 Dr D Vizai Bhaskar, CEO of AP Creativity and Culture Commission, said the motive behind the camp is to tap the potential and enhance the skills of the street kids. It is the responsibility of the government to support the street kids. We spot young talents and give them a platform to showcase their skills, he said.
 
 Any voluntary organisation coming forward to train kids to write Telugu poetry will be supported by AP State Creativity and Culture Commission under Sahitya Bhavishya Nidhi programme. “We want to pass on the art form to the future generations. We are thinking of making this a periodic programme,” said CCVA CEO E Siva Nagi Reddy.
