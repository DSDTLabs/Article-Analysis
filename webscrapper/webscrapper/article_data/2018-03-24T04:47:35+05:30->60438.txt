NEW DELHI:   has asked two pilots to quit after they turned up tipsy to operate flights twice. The airline is also investigating a complaint from a Bangkok hotel against another pilot who was allegedly so drunk he passed out in the lobby and relieved himself there earlier this month. The pilot has been called for questioning. According to sources, the two pilots who have been asked to resign are a captain and a co-pilot of a   737. 

 
 
 Sources said the airline followed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( ) norms and suspended their licences for three months after they failed the pre-flight breath analyser (BA) test. The two pilots had also failed BA tests before 2009. Though failing BA tests before 2009 are not counted while calculating the punishment for a repeat BA offence, the airline took a serious view of the second failure and asked the two to resign immediately in the interest of safety, according to sources. 
 
 When asked to comment on these issues, a Jet spokesman said: â€œSafety of guests is of paramount importance at Jet Airways and the company will take appropriate action against employees who abuse its code of conduct and prescribed regulations. As these are confidential personnel related matters the company cannot comment further.
 
 A pilot is grounded for three months, three years and permanently after failing preflight BA test for the first, second and third times, respectively. Those failing the breath analyser tests in post-flight checks get a year added to these groundings. 
 
 The DGCA had in 2016 directed registering of first information reports against two pilots and three cabin crew members of commercial airlines, who were found tipsy after operating international routes in post-flight BA tests. All pilots operating domestic flights undergo pre-flight alcohol tests to ensure only sober ones operate the planes. On international flights, pilots undergo post-flight checks as liquor is available onboard.
