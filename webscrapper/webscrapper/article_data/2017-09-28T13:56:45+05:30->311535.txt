*Jaitley's meeting with industry representatives comes a day after the BJP's own leader and former finance minister   called the   rollout "badly conceived and poorly implemented"

 *Representatives from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME), and the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) are expected to attend the meeting
 
 *These industry representatives will raise issues like input tax credit (credit received by the manufacturer for paying taxes toward manufacturing inputs) and timely refund of duties paid by exporters, sources told PTI
 
 *As in the past, FIEO is expected to raise issues related to the blockage of working capital and timely refund of GST. They have also asked that scrips be allowed to pay Integrated GST. Scrips are certificates that carry certain monetary value, and are incentives extended by the government to exporters. Currently, they can only be used to pay for basic customs duty.
 
 *Exporters may also reiterate the need for fast-tracking the refund process to avoid loss of competitiveness of the country's exports
 
 *Exporters warned last week that Rs 65,000 crore could get stuck in the July-October period, if the current mechanism of refunds for GST continues, but the government had disputed the number.
 
 *Minister of commerce and industry Suresh Prabhu on Wednesday said that he is working closely with other ministries "to address problems faced by exporters" with reference to GST
 
  
  
 
 *On Wednesday, Prime Minister   had asked the country's top bureaucrats to "handhold" traders to help resolve their GST-related grievances
 
 *Jaitley's meeting with industry representatives comes a day after the BJP's own leader and former   Yashwant Sinha called the GST rollout "badly conceived and poorly implemented"
 
 *Top BJP leaders came to their government's defence after Sinha's criticism, including his own son and minister of state for civil aviation  , who called GST and other economic reforms "game-changing efforts to formalise India's economy"
