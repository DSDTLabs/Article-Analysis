Viral videos of astronauts trying to eat food, drink water in zero gravity environment is something you would have come across quite often, but how about astronauts trying to play a sport in zero gravity. 

 
 So, while   was hogging all the press on Tuesday, crew members of the International Space Station of   – the Russian government space agency, decided to have little bit of fun with a game of badminton. As you could imagine, there was no court or net, but this special game in a special environment allowed the astronauts to move around 360 degrees - literally high-flying action, albeit in slow motion
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Athletes or rather astronauts from three countries -  , the United States and Japan - took part in the badminton orbital tournament.
 
 Alexander Misurkin, ISS commander and cosmonaut of ROSKOSMOSA had this to say about game: "The crew of the 54th expedition to the ISS played in a doubles badminton. And for me, it's all the same, that put the flag on Mars. You ask why badminton? Because I love it. Because badminton for me is not a sport, and not even a hobby. Badminton is a lifestyle. "
 
 In the first set, the Russian duo of Misurkin and Anton Shkaplerov took on Mark Vande hay of USA and Norishige Kanai of Japan. In the second set, Joseph Akaba replaced Vande hay; and while it wasn’t clear who one, but surely all the astronauts had super fun. 
 
 After the game, NASA   Vende Hay shared his positive emotions and noted that in the future, "in ships that will carry us to other worlds, it is necessary to provide a separate module for such a game, since it is very useful from the point of view of psychological relaxation and strengthening of friendly relations in a team ".
