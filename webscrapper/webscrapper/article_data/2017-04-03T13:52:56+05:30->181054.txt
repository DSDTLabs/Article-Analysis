THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Reiterating his demand that the education minister should resign following the SSLC question  , opposition leader   said the vigilance probe ordered was intended to deceive the public.

 Chennithala said the vigilance could probe only financial irregularities. He added that education minister   should face judicial probe.
 
 He also alleged that the government intended to save the pro-CPM teachers’ association which was entrusted with the responsibility of setting the questions and conducting the exams. “The examination was conducted bypassing the order of the previous government that the examination department should conduct the same. The question papers were set violating guidelines,” he said.
 
 “The investigation ordered is into the leak of maths paper only and not into the irregularities in connection with geography, journalism and Hindi papers of higher secondary exam.
