BHARUCH/SURAT: Jain monk Ratna Sunder Suri was given the   award on behalf of President of India by Gujarat chief minister   at Bharuch on Thursday for his distinguished services in the filed of spirituality and work for society. 

 ”The Padma Bhushan was given on the occasion of completion of Vijay Ratnasundar Surji’s 50th anniversary of his Sayyam Jeevan. Normally, Padma Bhushan is given at   by the President. But as Maharaj could not attend the ceremony on March 31, I was told to present the award to him on President’s behalf,” said Rupani. “I consider myself as one of the luckiest that as a Jain Shravak, God has chosen me on this occasion to honour most respectful saint. Earlier, only sportsmen, film stars and artists were chosen for such award. Now, those who are contributing to spiritual upliftment are being considered. It is truly a great step,” added Rupani. 
 
 While accepting the Padma award, Ratna Sunder Suri said, “I am happy to receive the Padma Bhushan award from Vijaybhai, a courageous CM who brought harsher law to stop killing of cow in Gujarat.”
