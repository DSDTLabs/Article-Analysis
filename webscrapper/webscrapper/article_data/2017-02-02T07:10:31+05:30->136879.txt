CHENNAI: The ruling AIADMK and DMK locked horns over the delay in conducting local body polls in the state, with the government passing a bill to extend the term of special officers so that they stay on until June or until the first meeting of the council is held after the election.

 Moving the   (Amendment) Bill and Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Bill, municipal administration and rural development minister S P Velumani said the government would hold elections as per rules as in the past. But his allegation that a petition filed by the DMK was the reason for the delay in holding polls set off a heated debate between the treasury and opposition benches. The polls were originally slated for October 17 and 19, but were put off in the eleventh hour after court intervention in a DMK petition.
 
 Armed with the court or der that set aside the poll notification in October, the DMK leader M K Stalin listed out the judge's observations that the election panel was rushing through the procedures in a hurried manner and not providing a level playing field for the contesting parties.
 
 Later, the House also passed a slew of bills, including the one exempting Tamil Nadu from   (NEET), enhancing the penalty for letting out sewage onto the drains and streets upto Rs two lakh, and omission of INTACH from the yet-to-be constituted Tamil Nadu Heritage Commission. Former Chennai mayor and Saidapet MLA M Subramanian strongly objected to the enhancement of penalty when the annexed areas of   are yet to receive proper sewerage infrastructure from the state. “The penalty has been levied based on the court order,“ Velumani explained.
 
 Meanwhile, DMK members walked out after Speaker P Dhanapal announced that Congress legislature party leader K R Ramasamy would be head of public accounts committee.
 
 Earlier, DMK MLAs led by Stalin walked out after Speaker did not heed to their request to not expunge the remarks of the DMK leader on Tuesday .
