KOCHI: A   has the right to get her evidence for the trial recorded early if she wishes to move on in life, the   has held. 

 "Calling upon a victim of rape to state her version of a gory incident while she is on the verge of setting up a new life should be avoided as far as possible. She is definitely entitled to have her evidence recorded expeditiously," a single bench judgment said.
 
  The decision came on a petition filed by a rape survivor from Malappuram. The case registered in February last year is pending trial before a special court in Malappuram for trial of offences against women and children. The survivor had sought expediting the trial proceedings as her marriage is scheduled to be held in a month. She feared that any collection of evidence after her marriage could affect her matrimonial life. 
 
 The prosecution informed the court during the hearing that police had filed a chargesheet in the case after completing the investigation. It also submitted that there were three witnesses, including the survivor, in the case. The bench directed the trial court to issue summons to witnesses and take steps to record their evidence within three weeks.
