CHANDIGARH: A Chandigarh district court on Friday issued a   to   Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak for failing to appear over a defamation suit filed against party colleagues.

 Both Singh and Pathak had moved defamation suits against Delhi MLA Devender  , Pavittar Singh, Lakhwinder Kaur and a former colleague Hardip Singh Kingra. The matter would again come up for hearing on April 26.
 
 Four separate complaints were filed against four persons in October 2016, but both Singh and Pathak appeared in the court only once and recorded their statements. Since then, a year has passed, the two have failed to appear.
 
 In a joint complaint against Sehrawat, they alleged that he was denigrating the party at the behest of opposition leaders. Sehrawat had written to Delhi CM   alleging that the complainants were indulging in sexual exploitation of women ticket aspirants from various constituencies in Punjab.
 
 The complainants had alleged that Pavittar and Lakhwinder had been repeatedly asking them to give a ticket to a person from Phillaur. Following this, the accused held a press conference earlier this year, in which they said that Singh and Pathak had demanded Rs 50 lakh.
 
 In the complaint filed by Pathak against Kingra, it was alleged that Kingra resigned after knowing that he would not get a ticket from Faridkot. Responding to it, Kingra held a press conference on September 1 in Chandigarh where he played an audio recording, purportedly between AAP worker from   and partyâ€™s Ludhiana sector observer Ambrish Trikha. In the said audio, Trikha is purportedly heard asking Dhillon that he would have to pay Rs 5 lakh per month to meet Pathak.
 
 In a separate complaint, Singh said that Kingra, in the same conference, mentioned that a member of the fund raising committee, Surinder Singh  , collected Rs 6 lakh and deposited only Rs 1 lakh in the party account, and gave Rs 5 lakh to Singh.
