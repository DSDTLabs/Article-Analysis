CHENNAI: On the pretext of seeking a lift, a gang of ten boys armed with knives seized a three-sovereign gold chain, two cell phones and Rs 3,000 from a lawyer on the   bypass road on Tuesday.

 Sivasubramani, a resident of  , was travelling on the bypass road early in the morning. When he reached Thalaipakkam near  , he saw a teenage boy in front of his car asking for a lift. 
 
 As soon as he stopped the car, he was surrounded by ten juveniles who brandished knives and started snatching things from him. He later lodged a complaint at the Kunrathur police station.
 
 Sivasubramani, who works as a legal advisor for a private company in  , told police that the boys appeared to be below the age of 15. Police have registered a case of robbery and launched a search for the boys.
 
 Police suspect that some history-sheeters may have trained the boys to carry out robberies. 
 
 “It is always risky to stop a vehicle on a deserted stretch, as there is no one to come to the rescue. This is the usual modus operandi of robbers who target motorists on the bypass road,” said an investigating officer.
 
 The road had witnessed similar cases last year, following which motorists requested police to keep patrol vehicles on the move to deter robbers.
