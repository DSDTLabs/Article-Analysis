VADODARA: The police are gathering evidences against the owner and plant in-charge of   GIDC-based Raykon Distribution which may lead to a major action against the duo in couple of days.

 The owner   and plant in-charge Divyesh Barot were booked at Nandesari police station last week for releasing acidic liquid in the ground. Police officials said that they conducted a punchnama at the plant on Monday and have taken statements of   (GPCB) officials.
 
 On Tuesday, the cops were expected to take statements of the company’s staff but that was not possible as the plant had been closed down. “We have been given enough evidences by GPCB and we are gathering some more following which we will arrest the accused,” said J K Patel, police inspector, Nandesari police station.
 
 A complaint was registered against the duo after the vigilance officials of GPCB conducted an inspection at the company in February and found an underground pipeline which was dumping sodium bi-sulphite in the ground which was acidic in nature and highly polluted. After the sample’s analysis report had arrived, the GPCB officials had approached the police.
