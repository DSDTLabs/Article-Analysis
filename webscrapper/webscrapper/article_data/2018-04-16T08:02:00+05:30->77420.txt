MANDYA: While   leaders and workers in the district are busy campaigning for the election, former district minister and   has stayed away from   district and is reportedly busy shooting for the movie Ambi Ninage Vayasaithu, a remake of Tamil movie Pa Paandi.

 It is said that   has distanced himself from active politics due to the sudden rise of former minister N   in the Congress. Nagamangala leader Cheluvarayaswamy, who had rebelled against JD(S) supremo HD   along with six other JD(S) MLAs, recently joined Congress in the presence of AICC president  .
 
 As Ambareesh, 65, kept himself away from the district, though he was made the district minister, he had to face the ire of both the public and party. In June 2016, chief minister Siddaramaiah dropped him from the ministry. The CM first made party strongman and energy minister  , and later housing minister M Krishnappa, both Vokkaliga leaders, district ministers.
 
 Congress sources say the party high command was furious with Ambareesh when he skipped the campaign in the district led by Rahul Gandhi. The actor-politician later cited health reasons for his absence.
