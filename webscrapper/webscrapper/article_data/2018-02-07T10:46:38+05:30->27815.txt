BHUBANESWAR: The ruling BJD and Congress on Tuesday termed the amount sanctioned for development of railways in the state as disappointing. Addressing a news conference here,   member Pratap Deb said the railways generate an annual revenue of Rs 16,000 crore from Odisha, but not a single new line has been allocated to Odisha, Deb said. 

 He said though the state government allotted 100 acres at Sitalapali in Ganjam district for a wagon manufacturing unit sanctioned in 2011-12, the project was dropped by the railways. "Before presentation of the budget, our chief minister had requested for the factory but the railways ignored it. It, however, sanctioned a coach manufacturing unit to Marathwada just a few days ahead of the budget," he added.
 
 Terming the claim of high allocation as an eyewash, the BJD MP said money allotted in the previous budget for crucial projects like   line, Jeypore-Nabarangapur line and   line could not be spent by the railway authorities. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister   said the claim of allocation of highest fund has no meaning as the Centre has failed to spend it. 
 
 Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said huge allocation of fund for Odisha during the   regime has put an end to the allegations Centre's negligence towards Odisha in the railway sector. 
 
 "While Odisha was receiving an average annual grant of Rs 838 crore during UPA-II, the NDA government has allocated Rs 5,252 crore in a year. This will give the much needed boost to economic activities and job creation in the state," Pradhan said. On allegations of funds could not be utilized, Pradhan said it was due to delay in acquisition of land by the state government.
