 The party claimed Dharmendra, a star campaigner for the BJP, made electoral promises regarding creation of job opportunities for local youths of Dhenkanal while attending an annual function of Dhenkanal (Autonomous) College on Tuesday. He announced this to woo voters in favour of the BJP, the party leaders alleged. 
 
 A delegation of the BJD, led by party general secretary Debasish Samantaray and spokesperson  , submitted a memorandum to the state election commission (SEC) demanding immediate action against Dharmendra and other BJP leaders present at the function. The BJD apprised the commission that these announcements were in violation of the model code of conduct.
 
 BJD spokesperson Prashanta Nanda claimed that Dharmendra told the gathering about future investments in the district. He also told the students that once investments come to the district, they would be able to get jobs.
 
 "Instead of talking about the institution and its annual function, the minister made poll promises in his speech. It clearly violates the poll code," Nanda said. 
 
 BJP state vice-president Samir Mohanty said the minister had not made any violation during the college function. "He had just mentioned the earlier announcement made by the government. He had not promised anything to woo the voters. The BJD should go through his speech in detail before coming up with such allegations," Mohanty said.
