 The IPV , an intramuscular vaccine, was the latest to be added to the vaccination programme of the state. IPV is given along with the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to inactivate viruses. But now, IPV is not available in a single government hospital. “We are not receiving supplies of IPV from the Centre. It is a global shortage. Not only Rajasthan, but all other states are also affected due to the short supply ,“ said Dr Satish Kumar Garg, state project director, immunization.
 
 The state had targeted to administer IPV to 17.5 lakh children annually . A child is first given IPV when he is one-and-a-half month old and the second dose of OPV when he is three-and-a-half years old. Earlier, the IPV was given as a single dose before a child completed one year. But, later, the health department started giving it in two doses.
 
 Dr Garg said there were two kinds of IPVs and OPVs. “We had eradicated polio from the state and the country using OPV only . There was no IPV at that time. In OPV there are `live' viruses, but in IPV there are inactivated viruses,“ Dr Garg said. The government has plans to replace OPV with IPV to get rid of live polio viruses. Besides, the government has shifted to bivalent OPV from trivalent as type 2 virus of polio has already been eliminated.
