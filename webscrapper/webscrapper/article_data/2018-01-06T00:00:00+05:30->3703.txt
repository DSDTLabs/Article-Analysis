 album is yet another musical mix inspired by the charm of Thrissur. 

 But the composer Gopi Sunder and lyricist Hari Narayanan have given it a fresh treatment, especially in the title song Kaatte Poora Kaatte, which makes the album interesting.
 
 The first track, titled Thrissur song, sung by Sannidhanandan, compares the locale to a beautiful girl and has a dappankuthu feel. The ethnic, groovy feel of the soundtrack stays true to the spirit of the place but the song can’t really be called catchy.
 Niranj Suresh sings the second song Innale Innale, which is all about random thoughts, faces and time periods. It’s a one-time delightful listen and the voice complements the idea very well. The apt rhythm makes you feel that the singer is just hopping from one stream of thought to the other, breezily. The track should sound better in film, if the scenes match the magic of the idea behind it.
 
 But the best track of the lot is Kaatte Poora Kaatte, again by Niranj. The song can be called the title track of the album. Its hook is not a simple or easy but works well with the song in its totality, just like the energetic pacing of the song. Accompanied with some adrenaline high scenes, the song can definitely be a show stealer.
