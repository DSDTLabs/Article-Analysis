NEW DELHI: Slamming the EC for the polling schedule in  ,   said the snow and chill of February will discourage voters in half the state and rob the exercise of a wider participation.

 Preparing to protest to the poll watchdog,   chief   said the party will write to the EC to reconsider the schedule.
 
 The views of the ruling Congress are shared by a wide section of society but political parties are wary of protesting lest it be seen as a sign of weakness, a reason why CM   told TOI that while chill is a factor, the schedule was a fait accompli.
 
 However, Upadhyay said Congress's concern over date of polling could not be interpreted as fear of polls since it was ready even for a December date. “It is about the convenience of voters,“ he said.
 
 The Congress functionary said that besides December, March would have been ideal when the effect of snow abates.
