It’s been five years since it has been on air. Soon, this daily soap will be celebrating 1,500 episodes. “And it has been a trendsetter from day one,” says Ravi Garani, the director of the serial  . “Now, we have gained another unique distinction as a serial which features the most faces from Sandalwood — they are either playing major characters or feature in cameos,” says Ravi.
 Playing in the prime slot of 9.30 pm, Amruthavarshini features veteran actor   in a powerful role and unlike the usual tale of conniving mothers-in-law, she is a protective and guiding force to her daughters-in-law. “Acclaimed actor  , Vinay Kashy, Madhuri and even Madarangi Krishna have played major roles or cameos on our show,” observes Ravi. Soon, the soap is set to witness the arrival of Pranaya Raja   and Padma Vasanthi who will lend further gravitas to the plot. “Since all of them already have a sizable fan base and are known names, audiences connect with them with ease. It adds to the attraction of the serial and with veterans around, it is always a pleasure to shoot,” Ravi wraps up.
