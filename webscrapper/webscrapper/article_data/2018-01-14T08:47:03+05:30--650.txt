CHENNAI:The Centre's move to shift headquarters of Animal Welfare Board of India ( ) from Chennai to New Delhi raised the heckles of officials and activists, who say it would dent the state's image as frontrunner for animal rights forums and compassion to animals. 

 India's first veterinary college was started in Chennai, and the   to Animals too originated in Tamil Nadu. AWBI, founded by  , also has its roots in the city.
 
 Board chairman S P Gupta said the proposal to shift the AWBI was indeed under the consideration of the Centre and that as per administrative rules, central government offices had to function from Delhi. The Centre has only asked the board to send a proposal for shifting the office. Instead of the head office, the Centre may set up a regional office of the board at Chennai, he said. 
 
 Another official from the board said the proposal first surfaced nearly two years ago and it was floated by the then chairman Maj Gen Kharb, who cited financial implications
 
 The decision to shift the office had been taken and sent to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change about a month ago.
 
 Former vice-chairman of the board Chinny Krishna pointed out that on the Centre's request, the then Tamil Nadu government immediately allotted lands in Tiruvanmiyur for the office and as well as for running a clinic. "Having spent so much for setting up the office, it will not make sense to shift the office to Delhi," he said.
 
 Animal welfare activist and co-founder of People for Animals ( ) Shiranee Pereira said her organisation had close interaction with the board for various animal welfare activities. "I do not know if the same kind of interaction will be possible if the office goes to Delhi," she doubted.
