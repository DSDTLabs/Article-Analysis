NEW DELHI: It was the tomb of an unknown Mughal noble. At some point, it even served as the local police station of  . Today, it’s a landmark used by traffic police and drivers when explaining directions for the area. It’s popularly (and mistakenly) called  . In reality, this monument has much more to it. 

 An ongoing conservation project jointly managed by Aga Khan Trust for Culture, Archaeological Survey of India, and Havell’s India Limited (under  ), aims to bring out its rich history and architectural details. It’s one of the earliest Mughal- era structures. 
 
 A unique building, it is richly ornamented with incised plasterwork, glazed ceramic tiles, wall paintings and decorative lattice stonework. The structure has suffered due to poor conservation in the past. The facade has been damaged, ornamentation has been lost, and there has been an impact of pollution too. Damage to the external and internal facade, loss of ornamentation work and high levels of pollution due its location at a roundabout where thousands of vehicles cross the monument daily. 
 
 The project started in November 2017 and is expected to be complete by December this year. Conservation work aims to ensure long-term structural stability of the structure as well as restoration of Mughal grandeur. Major works to be undertaken include repairing structural cracks on the upper dome, stabilising the foundation, providing plinth protection, restoring missing tile work on the neck of the dome, restoring intricate incised plasterwork patterns on the façade, and restoring missing sandstone lattice screens amongst others. 
 
 The tilework on the dome is one of the most challenging tasks and requires blue, green and yellow coloured tiles to be placed on the external dome. Each piece has to be precisely cut and shaped to fit into a specific space as per the original patterns still visible on the facade. The tiles are being made locally by Nizamuddin basti youngsters trained by expert artisans.
