PANAJI: The anti-corruption branch ( ) of the directorate of vigilance has registered a first information report against IPS officer   along with a woman police sub-inspector (PSI), her husband, and a police constable in an alleged bribery case.

 The ACB official said an FIR has been registered under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Gupta, woman (PSI) Devyani  , her husband and police constable Chetan Morajkar.
 
 The complaint, alleging a bribery case, was lodged by former ACB SP  , who had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the case.   came under the scanner following a bribery allegation made against him over closing a departmental enquiry against Ambekar.
 
 Last month, Ambekar and Morajkar were suspended for allegedly trying to influence the outcome of the inquiry. The file pertaining to the inquiry against Ambekar was with Gupta. It was alleged that money was paid to the then DIG through the police constable to close the inquiry, a source said.
 
 Ambekar was posted at the state police control room, while Morajkar of the IRB-Goa Police was posted at the office of the then DIG at the police headquarters.
 
 Last month, the state government relieved Gupta from the post of DIG. A day after Gupta was transferred out of Goa, chief minister   had said the IPS officer was relieved from the state administration because of his “not so good activities”.
