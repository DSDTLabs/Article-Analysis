NEW DELHI: In keeping with   orders, civic bodies on Monday continued the demolition of illegal structures built on footpaths across the capital. The traffic police department also checked illegally parked vehicles and several unattended cars and bikes were seized by the authorities.

 When TOI visited  , it found that only a few encroachments were being removed, mainly to follow the court’s orders. After towing only two vehicles, other car-owners were fined Rs 100 each.
 
 Traffic police said they were fining vehicle owners but the onus was on civic officials to undertake clearance of roads. SDMC officials, on the other hand, said it was the duty of the traffic police to tow vehicles that violated parking laws.
 
 The stretch adjacent to Amar Colony in Lajpat Nagar was cleared of parapets built illegally in front of shops. Vinita Gupta, a resident whose luxury car was being towed by officials, said: “Our car is not working and we have not been given enough time to even call a mechanic.”
 
 The south civic body carried out   drives at Captain Gaur Marg and Kalka Devi Marg and seized 12 vehicles. “Over 67 challans were issued by Delhi Traffic Police for illegal parking. Further, seven tin sheds were demolished, along with 36 illegal extensions like staircase, ramps, etc. Around 20 cycle rickshaws and 14 illegal carts were also seized,” a   official said.
 
 SDMC also carried out the drive at Lado Sarai T-point and seized two illegal carts and 18 other items, including water motors, PVC drum box, cooler, wooden takht, cycle and iron frames. North corporation, on the other hand, carried out encroachment removal drive at Shani Mandir, Vijay Nagar, Britannia Chowk and Peeragarhi Chowk.
