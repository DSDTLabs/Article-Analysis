LUCKNOW: Waiting in the heat and hunting for public transport to reach the nearest   station will soon become a thing of the past. Lucknow   ( ) has decided that e-rickshaws will be the feeder system to Metro because of their benefits to the environment and traffic flow.

 The e-rickshaws will be launched along the priority section from   to Charbagh from July to bring passengers from all colonies lying in Metro’s catchment area.
 
 The hunt for a suitable feeder system to Metro has been on for a year. LMRC had deputed a consultant to suggest the right kind of feeder system for Lucknow, considering its roads, traffic, congestion and localities near stations. After much brainstorming, e-rickshaws were finalised. In Delhi, Metro uses buses as the feeder system.
 
 The biggest benefit of the feeder is that Metro passengers hiring it need not carry cash for paying fair. The erickshaws will have GPS (global positioning system) and provided with a Metro card reader so that the fair is calculated based on the distance travelled. When the passenger swipes a Metro smart card, the required fair will be debited from the card.
 
 LMRC will sign an agreement next week with a Punebased company to provide erickshaws for its entire 23km-long North-South (NS) corridor between   and Munshipulia crossing. The complete corridor is expected to be commissioned in April 2019.
 
 “Everything is finalised. Both LMRC and the company will sign the dotted line next week. We needed a single provider of e-rickshaws for the complete corridor so that there is one source to talk about any improvement, fair or repair work.” Apart from being environment-friendly, e-rickshaws occupy less space and prevent traffic congestion. They can navigate through narrow lanes of colonies in Metro’s catchment area.
