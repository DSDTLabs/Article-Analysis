Director   is all set to introduce a gun-toting, badass female police officer in his next titled ‘Damini’.   Sengupta will be seen in the titular role as DCP  . This is the first time Rituparna will show her action chops and her character is loosely based on former IPS officer Kran Bedi. Bratya Basu will reportedly be seen in a negative role in ‘Damini’.

 The action flick has already gone on floors and on Sunday an action-packed sequence was shot at the Kolkata Police headquarter Lalbazar compound. Both Rituparna and Bratya Basu were present during the shooting. If all goes according to plan, the film will release at the end of the year. According to industry sources, the makers are also planning for the sequel of ‘Damini’. 
 
 Rituparna Sengupta’s last film was Kaushik Ganguly’s box-office hit ‘Drishtikone’ which also stars   in the lead. The narrative of this film, with matured dialogues, has really tugged at the heartstrings despite being an interesting thriller. The way director Kaushik Ganguly has treated the storyline and brilliant performances from all the artists have made this Bengali drama one of the biggest hits this year.
