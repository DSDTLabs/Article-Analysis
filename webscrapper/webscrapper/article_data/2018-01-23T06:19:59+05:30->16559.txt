AGRA: A major train collision was averted on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday as the   reportedly overshot a red signal at   and braked just a short distance behind another express train. 

 The former's engine and eight coaches went beyond the signal, while the  , late by nearly seven hours, was just 700 metres ahead on the same track.
 
 Both the trains had no halt at Mathura Junction. The Dehradun-bound express was heading towards Delhi from Agra at around 59kmph, while the other train was at 63 kmph.
 
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior railway official of the Agra division said, "Technically the train did not overshoot the red signal. It was a case of signal bobbing, in which a signal turns red automatically when a train is near. The loco pilots' alertness avoided the collision, as they brought the train to a halt before it collided with the train ahead of it."
 
 Railway oficials suspended the two very experienced loco pilots, identified as B D Rawat and  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, additional divisional railway manager of Agra division, D K Singh, said, "Prima facie it seems to be a case of human error, hence the two have been suspended for a while and a departmental inquiry has been setup to know the cause of the error." 
 
 A railway source claimed that, due to a curve in the track, the loco pilots of the weekly Pune-Delhi express train failed to see the signal and went ahead at a steady speed. However, when the message flashed out that they had missed the red signal, they immediately applied the brakes.
 
 In 2009, 22 passengers of Mewar Express were killed at Mathura Junction after the Delhi-bound   overshot a red signal and collided with it.
