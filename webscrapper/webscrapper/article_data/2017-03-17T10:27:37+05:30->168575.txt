PUNE: Three men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly duping   and jewellers by mortgaging   gold ornaments.

 The Khadak police recovered gold-plated ornaments worth Rs 7 lakh from the trio.
 
 Sanjay Gaikwad, sub-inspector of the Khadak police station, said, “So far, two moneylenders have complained against one of the suspects, Yogesh Oswal (34) of Guruwar Peth.”
 
 Gaikwad said that on March 12, a 45-year-old moneylender from Ganesh Peth approached the Khadak police and lodged a complaint that in October last year, Oswal had taken a loan of Rs 65,000 from him against a gold chain weighing 35g. 
 
 “Then, Oswal neither paid the instalments nor did he return the money to take the chain back,” Gaikwad said.
 
 Growing suspicious, the lender cut a piece of the chain and examined it, and found that it was made of copper. “While the police were probing this case, another moneylender lodged a complaint. Oswal had taken a loan of the same amount from him as well by mortgaging another gold-plated chain,” Gaikwad said.
 
 Police then laid a trap at Guruwar Peth and arrested Oswal on Tuesday. “During interrogation, Oswal revealed the names of his accomplices   (35), of Kharadi, and Arif Ansari (42), of Bhawani Peth. We have arrested them too,” Gaikwad said.
 
 According to police, the gang had taken loans from several moneylenders and jewellers using the same modus operandi. “We have recovered 700g of gold-plated ornaments form the trio,” Gaikwad said, adding that they were conducting a probe to find out where the trio obtained the   ornaments from.
