NEW DELHI:   has opened India's account at the   by clinching gold in the menâ€™s javelin throw event. In the F46 category, Sundar recorded his personal best effort of 60.36m on the very first night of the tournament and took the top honour.

  of Sri Lanka emerged second with 57.93m, followed by defending champion China's Guo Chunliang with a season best of 56.14m.
 
 Rajasthan's Sundar, a 21-year-old, was disqualified last year at the Rio Paralympics after he turned up late. Hene, he failed to compete in the F46 javelin throw category, the same event in which   won the gold medal. However, he had his moment in the sun in February this year, by putting in an inspiring show at the Fazza IPC Athletics Grand Prix, where he won three gold medals - one each in javelin throw, shot put and discus throw.
 
 A jubilated Sundar, after the win, said: "I was very disappointed after Rio, as I had prepared intensely and ultimately, could not compete. My morale was completely broken then, but I am delighted with this comeback to competition. I had trained hard for the World Championships as well, but not as much as I had done for Rio.
 
 "Hence, this gold medal is great motivation for me to perform even better from here on. I have recovered fully, and will do even better at the Asian Games (next year)."
