CHANDIGARH: Have you been to the park in  ? The park, which is located opposite the  , paints a picture of neglect. One visit to the park and you would instantly know that this property has not been maintained for a long time. 

 From   strewn across various places, to different kind of plastic waste, the park is in absolute  . Also, a huge pile of construction debris can be seen near the park.
 
 The kids refrain from playing here. The entire area is covered with dense grass. This thick undergrowth thus gives ample scope for the poisonous insects to breed. The residents are also worried about the ill maintenance of the park. “The parks in the city, otherwise, are so well kept, but we don’t know what has happened to this one? None of the portions of the park are fit enough to be used in any form by the residents. One cannot take a walk here because of the thick undergrowth. Moreover, garbage scattered here, has made it difficult to sit in this park ,” said Shivani, a resident of the area. 
 
 One of the benches is placed in such a way that it faces a wall. So, it is not used by the nearby residents or other people because the view gets obstructed.
 
 There’s one more reason why the children avoid playing here. The park has no swing. A plastic circular slide has been installed here only for the amusement of the kids. 
 
 Now, even though the park needs immediate attention, it still has a functional sprinkler in. “I have seen no cleanliness work taking place in this park for the last three months. This sprinkler waters the park in the evening, but for what? The wild grass just helps the weeds to grow,” said Rajeev Khanna, a nearby resident.
