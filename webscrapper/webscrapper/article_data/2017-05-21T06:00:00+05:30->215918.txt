Visakhapatnam: At 128 cm and 125 cm of height respectively, the sky is the limit for I Surendranath (23) and R Ravi (21). These two badminton players from the port city have been selected to participate in the World Dwarf Games to be held in Canada from August 4 this year. 

 However, lack of financial support from the government has forced them to look for sponsors who will pay them Rs 2 lakh each for all the travelling expenses. Height is not a hurdle to bring laurels to your country, but a little encouragement goes a long way, the sportspersons said, adding that they are confident of winning the gold. The duo took up the sport to get recognition from the society. Both the players have won silver medals in men’s doubles badminton tournament held in Hyderabad in February this year and were selected for the Indian team that would take part in World Dwarf Games. In the singles category, Surendranath won the bronze medal while Ravi stood fourth. They won the silver and bronze medals in Dwarf National Athletics also. Ravi said his father took a loan and paid Rs 70,000 registration fee for the games. 
 
 After learning about their zeal and enthusiasm, Chandra Sekhar, a badminton coach at Swarna Bharathi Stadium, volunteered to coach them for free. 
 
 “They are equally talented. We should be inspired by them and support them,” he said.
