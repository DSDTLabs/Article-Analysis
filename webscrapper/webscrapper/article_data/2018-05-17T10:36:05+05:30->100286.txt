LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh has been ranked first in the overall performance ranking of states in the sphere of rural development. The rankings have been released by the Union rural development ministry on Wednesday.

Likewise, UP scored the highest marks in job creation in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Other parameters where UP scored well included clean drinking water and national rural livelihood mission.
 
 
 Elated with the results, state rural development minister   said, “UP has scored well on all parameters which speaks for   government’s commitment for transparency. We will keep working hard to retain No. 1 position.” Principal secretary, rural development,   has been felicitated by the Union government for UP’s performance.
 
 
 Innovative transfer policy forofficers:Setting an example of sorts, the state rural development department has rolled out a performance based appraisal and transfer system for its class I officers. At least 65 officers got their transfer orders on the basis of a preferential ranking.
 
 
 “The officers were awarded marks on the basis of their performance against assigned targets. Thereafter, a merit list was released. Based on their scores, those eligible for transfer were asked to fill in the places of their choice. While the best scorer was allowed the place of choice, options decreased for low rankers,” explained NP Singh, mission director, national rural livelihood mission.
