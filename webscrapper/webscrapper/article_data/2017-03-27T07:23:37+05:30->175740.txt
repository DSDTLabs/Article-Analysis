 For the first time this year, the number of applicants was more than the number of seats available. However, in spite of the great demand, several students turned down schools allotted to them.

 Education officials said that while 60 students were rejected by schools for various reasons, there were 1,664 students who were allotted a seat but did not approach the schools for admission. “Parents want only specific schools.There are over 700 seats for which we have received no applications but there are seats for which more than three students have applied for. Parents need to understand that the child needs to be in school and not in a particular school,“ said an official.
 
 However, parents said that they had a difficult time completing admission formalities due to which they missed out.“The school asked us to get our income certificates signed by a BMC official. It took us over two days to get that done and by then, we missed the deadline,“ said a parent from Malad.
