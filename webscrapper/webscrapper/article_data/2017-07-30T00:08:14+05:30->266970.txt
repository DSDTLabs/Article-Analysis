Indore: The old and specially- abled people, who use the battery operated cars at Indore railway station, face inconvenience as they have to carry their bags along with them on seats in absence of luggage basket.

 The agency that operates the cars on the station premises has removed the luggage basket installed behind the cars. 
 
 “It has become very difficult for   in need of assistance to book the cars since they cannot carry more than two luggage bags along with them on the cars,” said a passenger Ashish Soni.
 
 There would be a separate basket behind the vehicles. The basket has been removed and if more than four passengers sit along with their luggage all of them have to carry their luggage with them on the seat, he said. 
 
 A canteen operator on the station premises said that the operator has removed   from three cars last week. “It has been a week since the operator removed the baskets from the cars. Due to this passengers have to sit along with their own luggage,” he said. 
 
 One of the battery operated cars had on July 15 carried heavy luggage on the station premises. The railways officials, after the matter came to their notice, imposed a penalty of Rs 5000 on the agency, which operates the cars. 
 
 Railway officials said that the buckets might have been removed from the cars to restrict the staff from transportation of heavy luggage with the help of the cars. “The agency, which operates the cars on the station premises, was instructed to keep a check on its staff,” said a senior railways official. 
 
 However, the operator said that the basket have been removed for a repair purpose. “The luggage baskets will be installed back in the vehicles as soon as they will come after repairing,” the agency manager Shreekant Yadav told TOI.
