GURUGRAM: It took a woman six months and an appeal to the chief minister’s grievance window to get an   registered over a   dispute in  .

 Nirmala Devi was allegedly denied help by the police at the Kherki Daula station, when she approached them in September last year to file a complaint against some persons who had allegedly occupied 15 of her shops in Shikohpur, Manesar, and were refusing to vacate.
 
 An FIR case was finally registered against the two accused in the case on Monday.
 
 Nirmala, who currently lives in Rewari with her husband, has 20 shops in Shikohpur. “The illegal occupants threatened to kill me when I asked them to vacate the shops,” she told the police.
 
 She said that the police, instead of filing an FIR against the accused, called both the parties at the police station for reconciliation, but it resulted in a spat. She then approached the   of the area, who, she claimed, was also not able to help her as the effort towards a settlement had further antagonised the two parties. Inspector Yashwant Yadav, in turn, said it was an old dispute within the family and the two accused named in the FIR are related to Nirmala. 
 
 “We consulted the state lawyers to ascertain if an offence had taken place and then a case was registered against the accused under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy),” said Yadav.
