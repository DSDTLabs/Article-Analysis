CHENNAI: After their repeated complaints against the dumping of garbage along the   went unheard, residents of a gated community in   have launched a petition campaign on change.org. Mounds of waste dumped by civic authorities in areas like Navalur not only inconveniences thousands of residents but also highlights the lack of a waste disposal system, says the petition.

 The space between gated communities on the IT corridor and the canal now resembles a dump yard, say residents. "On several days, garbage is burned there. On other days, especially during rain, the dumped garbage sends out such a stink that it is difficult to live here. Thousands of individuals and children are living with this unbearable stink and smoke," said  , who lives in a gated community.
 
 Many residents said their requests to panchayat officials to take steps to stop the dumping near the canal had fallen on deaf ears. Others said both panchayat workers and private vehicles resorted to the practice. "The volume of garbage being generated and dumped has increased, and it has become increasingly difficult for us to live in this area," said another resident.
 
 "We have been living with this problem for nearly two years now. Each time we go to the Tiruporur block office, we are told how the panchayat does not have land that can be used as a dump yard. And through the years, dumping and burning waste along the canal continues unabated," said Dr  , secretary of the Olympia Opaline Flat Owners Association.
 
 Residents said officials of the panchayat had denied dumping of garbage by its workers along the canal. The officials concerned were not available for comment.
