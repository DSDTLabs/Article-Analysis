CHARMINAR: The emphasis of the   that one should perform Haj in one's youth has now received scientific backing as Indian researchers point out that young pilgrims face less risk of health complications and mortality than old Hajis. 

 Data collected by doctors from various health camps and mobile clinics organised by the   during the Haj seasons in the last three years in Jeddah, Mecca and Medina reveals that a majority of patients hospitalised were between 70 and 90 years. Results of the data obtained from the Indian Medical Mission was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Infection and Public Health. 
 
 Lead author Dr Inam Danish Khan told TOI that old pilgrims should not go alone for Haj. The problem gets compounded if the couple are old. They should always be accompanied by an attendant as the average stay of pilgrims during Haj is about 45 days. 
 
 The mean age of old patients hospitalised was 73.89 per cent. On an average each patient stayed for at least three days. Old people are prone to minor injuries. 
 
 According to Dr Danish, many pilgrims take pain-killers to undertake physically demanding religious rituals. This abuse of pain-killer drugs causes health complications particularly those related to digestive system, kidneys, livery and heart.
 
 "Outdoor pilgrimage rituals are associated with dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and sunburn. Multiple comorbidities (several health problems in one individual) seen in about 20 per cent patients represent a big burden on tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia. It forms the main risk factor for mortality during Haj," warns Dr Danish. This is felt more if the pilgrim is a senior citizen.
