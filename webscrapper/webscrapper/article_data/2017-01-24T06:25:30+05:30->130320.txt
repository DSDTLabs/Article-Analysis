AHMEDABAD: A 26-year old youth has requested a local court to expedite criminal proceedings against him because the long-pendency of the case led to his divorce.
On Saturday morning,  , an engineer, filed an application for cancellation of warrant against him before the   No 14. While requesting the court to cancel the warrant issued against him for skipping a couple of court proceedings, Jogsan complained that six-year long pendency of the criminal proceeding against him resulted in his divorce. He submitted before the court that he was so disturbed following his divorce that he missed a couple of dates on which he had to appear before the court.
 
 Jogsan has been facing charges of molestation under   after a complaint for eveteasing was lodged against him and his friend   with Bapunagar police in 2011.
 
 According to Jogsan's advocate Anand Brambhatt, Jogsan's wife Devanshi waited for a couple of years to get the case over, as her husband assured her that he would be acquitted because false charges were invoked against him. But when the court case did not move further, the wife became desperate and began doubting her husband's word. “Three months ago, the couple finally got customary divorce,“ the lawyer said.
 
 The advocate said that the charges of eve-teasing were slapped as a counterblast of complaint lodged by them against the rival group. Since the charges were levelled on both the sides, the court granted bail to the accused. But the case first came up for hearing in 2013 only and the trial has not got over even after six years.
