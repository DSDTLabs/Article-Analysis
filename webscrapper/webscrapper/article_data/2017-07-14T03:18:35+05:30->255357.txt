NNEW DELHI: Opposition parties, who have been invited by external affairs minister   and home minister   for an all party meeting on Friday to discuss India's stand-off with China and the Kashmir situation post the terror strike at the Amarnath Yatra, are taking the government's offer with a pinch of salt. 

  An opposition party leader told TOI on Thursday, "Before Parliament session begins, this meeting is just an attempt to show that they (government) are taking Opposition on board, which this government never does, on crucial decision making that has to do with the border situations on both sides." 
 
 The   beginning on July 17 is expected to be stormy, with opposition parties gearing up to take on the government on issues like lynching deaths caused by cow vigilantes, communal and vendetta politics, unrest on the India-Pakistan and India-China border. 
 
 The government has called a special all party meeting on China and Kashmir for which invitations went out from Sushma Swaraj's side on Thursday. 
 
 The meeting whose likely venue is home minister Rajnath Singh's residence is aimed at briefing the opposition parties about the situation along the border in Sikkim where a stand-off has been continuing since June. 
 
 Two usual all party meetings have already been called for July 16, a day before the session begins. One of the opposition parties —Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress — has already decided to boycott the meeting called by parliamentary affairs minister where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be present, though it will attend the meeting of all the parties called by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on the same day.
