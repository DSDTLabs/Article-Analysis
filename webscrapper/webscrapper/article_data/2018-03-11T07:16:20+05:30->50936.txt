HYDERABAD: Irked by the rampant digging of roads in the area, scores of residents from the IT belt have now tuned to social media platforms to raise their voice and complain about incessant works. Commuters point to the bad road conditions as the primary cause for traffic chaos.

 Residents of localities such as PJR Enclave, Patrika Nagar, Madhapur, Gachibowli,  , Moosapet, KPHB and Bhandari Layout, while ruing how even new roads are not being laid properly, identify the frequent digging up of roads by various departments as the top concern. “Crores of rupees is being spent on laying roads that are then dug up for laying cable and pipelines within two or three months. Roads lie in pathetic condition for six months and then new roads are laid again and the cycle continues,” wrote  , on Twitter.
 
 Social media platforms are currently rife with such posts, addressed to the   (GHMC), the MAUD minister and other civic officials. “The PJR Enclave road is being continuously dug up for the past one year and your department is taking more than a month to complete pipeline laying for a 30-meter stretch. Horrible condition of PJR Enclave road due to continuous digging and there is also lots of dust and air pollution caused due to this. Request KTR Garu to send someone to visit and see the condition,” wrote  , a resident of Chandanagar.
 
 Dubey’s post in fact garnered a response from GHMC’s official Twitter handle. “The @HMWSSBOnline is laying two rows of pipelines. The work is not yet completed and about 30 metre length are left and junctions are to be connected. Discussed with @HMWSSBOnline authorities, they promised to complete within a week,” wrote engineers of GHMC’s Chandanagar division on February 4.
 
 However, despite GHMC’s promise, Chandanagar residents point out that condition of PJR enclave road has not improved yet. Sharath Grandhi, a resident of Moosapet, meanwhile turned to Twitter to describe the bad condition of a newly-laid road near   hospital.
