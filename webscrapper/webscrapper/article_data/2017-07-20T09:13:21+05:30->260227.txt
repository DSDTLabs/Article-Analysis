BHOPAL:   activist Medha Patekar was arrested from   station on Wednesday morning, as a ‘preventive measure’.

  She had come to the city to meet the chief minister to speak on the Sardar Sarovar dam issue. However, she, and hundred-odd supporters, were arrested before they could go to Gandhi Bhawan. AAP leader Alok Agarwal was also held and taken to Bhopal Jail. They were freed in the evening. 
 
 Those who were left behind at the station were raising slogans and protesting at the railway station. 
 
 According to the members of Narmada Bachao movement, more than thousand people were arrested, but as per police records only 116 people were held. They have been protesting against the increase in the height of Sardar Sarovar dam to 138.68 metres. This has put homes of as many as 40, 000 families in the   on the verge of submergence. “There is waterlogging at the rehabilitation centres and even basic amenities are not available. Instead of lending an ear to problems, government is in a hurry to displace 40,000 families,” they alleged.
 
 DIG Bhopal Santosh Singh said, “Preventive action was taken against 116 people; 13 were arrested by GRP at Bhopal station and, 103 were booked at Habibganj station. Such action was necessary as they wanted to go to areas where movement has been restricted due to Section 144.” 
 
 Leaders of the Narmada Bachao movement said the arrests made by the state government to stop them from meeting the chief minister is an ‘undeclared emergency’.
