MANGALURU: Union minister for skill development and entrepreneurship Anantkumar   again had foot firmly in the mouth by saying the country’s history has been recorded incorrectly.

 “The historians who documented India’s history had an English mindset,” Hegde said, at the   ceremony at   in Udupi on Thursday. “They’ve written the country’s history incorrectly. They say India has a history of 5,000 years. But the country has a history of sages, and not princely states and their exploits. When religious practices went awry, sages guided people towards the right path,” he said.
 
 He went on to add: “The Hindu religion is the one that believes in the worship of power. All our deities have weapons in their hands. We need to follow their footsteps and face challenges with grit and valour.”
 
 Reacting to Hegde’s remarks, major and medium industries minister,  , said. “He does not know what he is speaking. He can achieve nothing by provoking."
