Mumbai: In a setback to telecom giants   and   Cellular, the   refused to grant an interim stay against a September 17 notification of sector regulator   by which interconnection usage charge (IUC) has been slashed from 14 paise per minute to 6 paise with effect from October 1. The   will eventually drop to zero from January 1, 2020. 

 According to Trai, voice calls will form a very small faction of services being provided by such companies. The bulk of the revenue will be generated by data transfer, through  . IUC is a charge that the service provider of the calling party is liable to pay to the service provider of the call receiver for usage of its network to complete the call. For instance, if a   customer in Goa wants to connect with an Airtel customer in Delhi, these charges are to be paid by Vodafone to Airtel, and vice versa if the call is to be returned.
 
 Airtel counsel Janak Dwarkadas said that the company stands to lose Rs 140 crore a month due to the reduction, while Idea counsel Darius Khambata put the losses at approximately Rs 700 crore a year. Khambata, however, stressed that under Trai Act, the decision to change any technology was exclusively the privilege of the licenser, which is the Department of Technology (DoT), whereas Trai is only a recommendatory body. Hence, the September 17 notification, which talks of reducing IUC, is based on a new data transfer technology and therefore it had indirectly sought to bring in a change contrary to its powers.
 
 Trai counsels Ravi Kadam and Ameet Naik said that a legislation, even if a delegated one like this, cannot be stayed by the court unless there is manifest arbitrariness or illegality. A bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Z A Haq agreed with Kadam and declined relief to Airtel and Idea. The two telcos may now file an appeal with the SC.
