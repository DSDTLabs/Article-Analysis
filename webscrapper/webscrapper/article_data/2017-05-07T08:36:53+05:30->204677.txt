HYDERABAD: In a crackdown on rash driving in the city, traffic police late on Friday night caught 19 persons, mostly   high-end bikes and cars, near  ,   

 Banjara Hills traffic inspector N Vidya Sagar said 16 bikes and three cars, including an Audi A4 and a modified Maruti Gypsy were seized on the stretch between KBR Park main gate and Jubilee Hills checkpost. 
 
 “All the vehicles were seized during the drive and the drivers were asked to come to the court. Chargesheets will be filed against the erring motorists,” the inspector said. 
 
 Police said the riders were driving at high speed and many had modified silencers, creating sound pollution in the night. Many motorists were found driving zig-zag between 12am and 3am, he added. 
 
 The youngsters, in groups, were wandering around KBR Park, causing nuisance and indulging in hooliganism too. Their rash and dangerous driving disturbed the calm of the area. 
 
 In the past, Banjara Hills police had taken up several awareness programmes, especially on rash and negligent driving, and now the erring motorists are being produced in court. 
 
 Though police have been cracking down on youth racing on Necklace Road, KBR Park-Jubilee Hills Checkpost stretch and the ORR, it failed to deter the riders. Now, they would be produced in court and might even get a jail term like those driving under the influence of alcohol.
