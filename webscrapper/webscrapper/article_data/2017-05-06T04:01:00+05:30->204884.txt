AHMEDABAD: The city police have carved out   from the existing boundary area of   police station to make it 46th police station of the city police force. Apart from the 46, city police also has two woman police stations, one DCB police station and three traffic police stations, taking the total number to 52.

 As per a notification issued on Friday, the new police station will come into existence from 12 midnight on May 6. The   police chowky will be converted into the a police station. The proposal was pending for past two years but as the boundaries of Vejalpur and   police stations were redrawn due to inclusion of some of the areas currently in Ahmedabad rural police jurisdiction, the decision was taken to start a zero-budget police station.
 
 With the redrawn boundaries, areas such as Bakrol circle, Vanzar, Fatewadi and   would now be part of Ahmedabad city policeâ€™s jurisdiction, taking it closer to the municipal boundaries of the city.
