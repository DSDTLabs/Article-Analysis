TRICHY: After TOI reported the victimisation of a guest faculty in Perambalur Government Arts College, the regional joint director for collegiate education (RJDCE), Trichy, began an inquiry on Tuesday.

 Despite being appointed three months ago to the Tamil department as guest faculty by RJDCE,  , 38, was neither allotted classes nor allowed to join the college. He was a victim of the cold war between college administration and the head of Tamil department M  . 
 
 On Tuesday, Anbazhagan was summoned by   for inquiry. When contacted over phone, Senthamilselvi, while not disclosing the details of the inquiry, stated that she got Anbazhagan’s version on the whole row and will carry out an inquiry after visiting the college.
 
 When asked why there was no action all these months when a guest faculty was made to wait without salary, despite being appointed by the government, she said that the appointment of guest faculty was within the purview of the DCE. She said she would submit a report to the director of collegiate education (DCE) after the inquiry. DCE N Manjula was unavailable for comments despite several attempts to reach her over phone.
 
 The college administration had appointed Siva Kumar on the recommendations of DCE N Manjula. However, Anbazhagan refused to recognise the appointment as he was not consulted for the appointment made to the department which he heads.
 
 Anbazhagan prevented Siva Kumar’s appointment by not allotting classes to him for the past three months. Left with no option but to wait till the issue subsides, Siva Kumar had been sitting on the ground and library all these months to which the college administration remained a mere spectator.
