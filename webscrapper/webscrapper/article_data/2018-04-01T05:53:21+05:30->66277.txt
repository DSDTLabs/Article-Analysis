KOLKATA: The city, long seen as a traditional drug transit point, is slowly emerging as a fledgling market for costly party drugs. Acting on information provided by drug peddler  , who is now in police custody, the narcotics cell of   on Friday seized 140g of hash oil and 30g of charas from a house on Alimuddin Street.

 
  
 
 Shafique was arrested last week from the airport while trying to flee to Jaipur. He’s one of the eight persons nabbed recently by the detective department on charges of procuring, stocking and selling new age party drugs like LSD and   to students and IT professionals in the Park Street and   areas.
 
 Hash oil, claimed police sources, is a party drug widely used in Bengaluru and Delhi. The total cost of the sticky substance, which is a mixture of hashish and several life-threatening chemicals, is estimated to cost around Rs 49,000. Hash oil, sold in cartridges, are also used by pen vaporizers to discreetly smoke in public.
 
 “This oil is usually spread on a cigarette paper and smoked in rave parties. It sends an addict to a two-hour trance. It is comparatively less costly and thus very popular among students,” claimed a police source.
 
 This year, Kolkata Police has recovered 16.3g of MDMA and the NCB another 13.5g, besides nine tablets of Ecstasy. “This is way more seizure in the city than in the past five years. The reasons are simple — the cost of 1g of cocaine has gone up to Rs 10,000 as compared to LSD (that comes at Rs 3,000/g) and MDMA (Rs 6,000/g). The drug also gives a high within 45 minutes. We need to curtail these party drugs if we are planning to stop youths from getting attracted to rave parties,” said an officer.
