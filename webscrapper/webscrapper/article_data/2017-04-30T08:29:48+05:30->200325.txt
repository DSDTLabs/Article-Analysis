CHANDIGARH: To dispel doubts on EVM tampering, chief election commissioner (CEC) Nasim Zaidi said on Saturday that the Election Commission (EC) would soon convene an all-party meet over the issue. 

 He said that the commission intended to use voter-verified paper audit trail ( ) in all coming elections to bring in more transparency and boost the confidence of voters in the electoral process. “We will soon hold an all-party meeting in which they will be told how our EVMs can’t be tampered with and are secure as per our administrative and technical safeguard system,” the CEC told mediapersons here. Zaidi was responding to questions about allegations levelled by various political parties against EVMs. 
 
 
  
 
 Recently, 16 opposition parties had urged the EC to revert to ballot system, claiming that the faith of the people in EVMs had been “eroded”. Zaidi said the EC was planning to 
  to prove if the machines could be tampered with and a timeframe for this was being worked out. 
 
 On VVPAT machines, he said, “For VVPAT, we have got the funds. We have placed an order for the supply of 15 lakh VVPAT machines with two PSUs Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronic Corporation of India (ECI).” He said that the 15 lakh VVPAT machines are likely to be ready by September 2018. 
 
 “The commission’s objective is to use VVPATs in all coming elections. India will perhaps be the first country where there will be 100% use of VVPATs at all polling stations. It will boost voters’ confidence and bring more transparency in the election process,” Zaidi said, adding, an awareness campaign would be launched in this regard.
