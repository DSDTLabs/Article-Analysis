PATNA: A member of the RJD’s youth wing was shot dead at his home at   in   district on Saturday.
 
  Sources said   was a full-time politician and a close aide of jailed ex-MP Mohd Shahabuddin. The 28-year-old was shot in the head around 3.30am while he was asleep inside his two-storey house. Two empty cartridges of 9mm were recovered from the spot.
  
    police station SHO Dharmendra Kushwaha suspected the criminals numbering five were acquainted with him. “They knocked the door and barged into the house the moment a family member opened it. Without wasting time, they went to Minhaz’s room and fired at him,” another officer quoted family members as having told police.
  
  The criminals had reached the spot with two containers full of petrol. Besides the containers, country-made explosives and a carbine were recovered by police from the backyard of the house. “The criminals had ostensibly planned to set afire the house,” the police officer said.
  
  Police said   had criminal antecedents. He had gone to jail in the past. “However, we are yet to ascertain the reason for the murder,” the police officer said.
