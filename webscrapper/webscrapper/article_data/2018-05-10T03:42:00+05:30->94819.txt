MARGAO: Taking umbrage at   and Country Planning minister   Sardesai’s statement on Monday that he would “freeze” development in Salcete if so desired, former tourism minister Fransisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco challenged   to stop basic infrastructure development in even one constituency of Salcete.

 “As it is, the present government has not brought about any development since it came to power, and the   minister has the audacity to speak of stopping development,” Pacheco told mediapersons. “The weaker section of society in the state is still deprived of basic infrastructural amenities like water, electricity, and roads. How can one dare speak of freezing development?”
