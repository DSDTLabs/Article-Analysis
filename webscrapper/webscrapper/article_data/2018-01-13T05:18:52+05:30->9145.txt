NAVI MUMBAI:   will submit a final detailed project report this month-end, on metro connectivity from   international airport (CSIA) to Navi Mumbai international airport (NMIA) and Panvel, to MMRDA, the nodal agency for the project.

 MMRDA sources said the project’s cost and other details will be known after they get the report, but they have initiated talks with   for a location for a depot. “It has to be a bigger area as the CST-Panvel elevated metro corridor, with a spur to NMIA, will run on the same corridor from Mankhurd, where the two metros meet and bifurcate. The location for the depot, which will serve both metros, will be finalised soon,’’ they said.
 
 The NMIA deadline is fast approaching, in 2019-end or early 2020, for the maiden take-off for enhancing connectivity with Mumbai. The CST-Panvel corridor topped the agenda at the Union railway minister’s meeting with stakeholders on MUTP-III (A) projects on Friday.
