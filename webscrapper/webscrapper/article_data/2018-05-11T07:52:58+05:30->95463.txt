CHENNAI: A stray fawn, which had a near-death experience on Rajiv Gandhi Expressway (Old Mahabalipuram Road-OMR) early on Thursday, was   by wildlife officials.

 The six-month-old spotted deer was noticed on the service lane running parallel to OMR by morning walkers. It further strayed onto the main high-speed carriageway near   (VHS) premises. 
 
 Within seconds, it was hit by a motorcycle. The fawn jumped over the median in panic and darted across the OMR. It then got trapped in a trench dug up for a pipeline project under MRTS lane.
 
 Frantic calls to emergency number ‘100’ did not yield any response. Morning walkers even tried to get help from policemen manning the   traffic signal. When nothing worked, they then contacted media persons who alerted the wildlife officials.
 
 Responding promptly to alerts, wildlife officials from headquarters range office rushed to the spot and rescued the fawn, lying in the trench terrified and quivering. Wide-eyed and with raised ears, the fawn was shivering with the honking of vehicle horns.
 
 A team of wildlife officials, led by forester  , rescued the fawn and took it to their office on Velachery main road. A veterinarian from   will check the health condition of the animal,   said.
 
 The animal had a minor injury to its legs from being hit by the motorcycle. The animal is now in a separate enclosure on the forest office premises.
