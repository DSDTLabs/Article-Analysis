British actor   has said that he is eager to obtain US citizenship so he can play a part in opposing President Donald   and his controversial policies. 

 The 76-year-old 'X-Men' star married American singer   in 2013, and the couple lives in Brooklyn, New York. 
 
 Patrick had previously thought about applying for US citizenship, but he is now more determined than ever to become an American so he can protest Trump with purpose and use his future vote to try and make a difference. 
 
  
  
 "I am now applying for citizenship because I want to be an American too, because all my friends in Washington (DC) said there's one thing you can do: fight, fight, oppose, oppose," he told on a US talk show. "But I can't do it because I'm not a citizen."
