BAREILLY: Even two years after his murder, police are still groping in the dark to find a lead to crack the murder case of India Veterinary Research Institute’s ( ) principal scientist Deepak  .

 Sharma, then head of IVRI’s animal genetics department, was allegedly murdered by four unidentified people by a scalpel on July 30, 2015 at his campus residence.
 
 Following the directions of top cops, city superintendent of police (SP) Rohit Singh Sajwan issued strict instructions to investigating officer (IO) Naresh Tyagi to crack the case at the earliest.
 
 “There have been no concrete steps taken by you to work out the case. It has been two years since the incident took place, and it comes across that the IO has taken least interest in the case and has restricted all the developments to mere formality. My seniors have also raised strong objection to it,” Sajwan said in a notice to Tyagi and the station house officer at the   police station.
 
 According to his domestic help  , Sharma, 59, was allegedly killed by men known to him.
 
 Police said Deepa told them that at 9 pm, the doorbell rang and she opened the door to find a few people standing outside. One of them asked for Sharma and another man even shook hands with Sharma, said Deepa.
 
 “However, things took an ugly turn once the men entered the house. There were signs of a struggle between Sharma and the visitors, who overpowered him by pressing a pillow on his face and stabbed him with scissors in the neck. He succumbed to injuries on the spot,” said police.
 
 The sensational murder case had run into several twists during the initial investigation and had hogged media limelight for months before the investigation in the case lost its sheen and eventually hit a dead end with no breakthroughs in the past two years.
