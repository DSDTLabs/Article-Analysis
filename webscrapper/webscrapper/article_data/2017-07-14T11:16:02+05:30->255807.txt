  : In a major setback to Narottam Mishra, election commission of India has for the second time informed Madhya Pradesh   about his disqualification on Thursday, indicating that he cannot vote in the presidential election. Mishra has gone to court for a stay on his disqualification, saying he wants to vote in the Presidental polls. 

 Mishra's case is in Delhi high court, which reserved its order on Thursday.
 
 Sources in   confirmed that the   Vidhan Sabha has been informed that Mishra cannot vote. "He is ineligible provided the court decides otherwise. The EC's letter about Mishra's disqualification reached Vidhan Sabha minutes before it received the voters' list," a senior EC official said. Chief electoral officer of Madhya Pradesh, Salina Singh, refused to comment on this.
