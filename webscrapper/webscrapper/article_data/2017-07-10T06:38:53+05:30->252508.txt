GUWAHATI/KOHIMA: A day after former chief minister  's move to stage a coup d'état,   CM and ruling Naga People's Front (NPF) president Shurhozelie   struck back on Sunday , sacking four cabinet ministers and suspending them from the party along with six other MLAs, including his predecessor, T R Zeliang. The CM also sacked 10 parliamentary secretaries, of which four are from NPF and six are Independents, for supporting Zeliang.

 On Saturday , Zeliang had staked claim to form government, saying he had the support of 34 NPF legislators. On Sunday, he left for Delhi to meet state governor P B Acharya.
 
 To save the Liezietsu government, NPF led an emergency meeting in   on Sunday afternoon. NPF central officebearers resolved to appeal to the CM to “grant amnesty to those legislators led astray by few vested interests who are at present camping at a   resort, and to let them come back to the party fold in the larger interest of the party and the partyled government.“
 
 The meeting also supported the decision of the disciplinary committee to recommend the suspension of the 10 legislators and “vehemently condemn the shameful act of treason and betrayal perpetrated by a few ring leaders to destabilise the partyled government.“
 
 Zeilang, 65, was forced to step down five months ago amid public outcry over the government's move to reserve seats in urban local bodies for women.“The political crisis in Nagaland is solely due to CM Liezietsu's undemocratic style of functioning... Because of his style of functioning, the MLAs are not happy ... a majority of them want a change of guard,“ Zeliang said. He may meet PM Modi and home minister   in Delhi. The BJP is a partner of NPF in the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) government.
