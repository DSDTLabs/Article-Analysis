 The Devikulam sub-collector had banned trekking and MUV safari in the Kolukkumala route recently. “Around 70 to 120 Jeeps were conducting safaris on this route and now they are facing a huge financial crisis,” said Vijayan.

 “The MVD has directed all vehicles offering safari rides to present their vehicles for checking before April 30,” said Idukki RTO R Rajeev. During inspection, the MVD had found that many unfit vehicles were being used for safari.
 
 “Many Jeeps have no insurance and proper documents. From May 1, we will seize the illegal vehicles and issue identity cards to eligible drivers,” added Rajeev.
