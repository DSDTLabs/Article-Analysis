Indore: Bird lovers in Indore have a reason to rejoice as the city has for the first time   a  , a crow sized bird, which only perches at high masts or towers. The winter migratory bird was sighted by birders from the city at a high mast at Holkar stadium on Saturday evening. 

 The peregrine can be distinguished from crows, eagles and other similar looking birds on the basis of its blue-grey back, barred white under parts and a black head. Its flight is swift and powerful, which also sets it apart from other birds. 
 
 The bird sighted in Indore is a powerful, broad chested peregrine. It is an aerial predator, especially adapted for speed, long distance flight and killing birds in the air. In Indore the bird is estimated to have arrived from 
 
 “The reason why I feel the peregrine falcon has come to Indore is its dietary base- mainly pigeons and other smaller birds-which has increased in the city. The peregrine falcon was sighted commonly in different parts of India, but never in Indore, especially within the city,” bird watcher and expert Ajay Gadikar said. 
 
 The bird has characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom. The highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 kilometre per hour. 
 
 “The city has also developed greatly in the past years as there are now higher masts and towers, which give enough height to this predatory bird to dive down and hunt,” said another bird watcher Sajid Lodhi, who sighted the peregrine falcon. 
 
 The peregrine falcon is associated with mankind for long and has been used in falconry practiced in earlier times. Today in Middle East it is a symbol of prestige among the royalty and the wealthy. This bird is also one of the most widely distributed species in the world.
