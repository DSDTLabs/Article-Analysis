Nagpur: Urmila Kshirsagar of Niramay Bahu-uddeshiya Sanstha, Madhav Nagar, and Ashok Warnekar of Bhaskar Sanskar Kendra, Parbatipur, Assam, were bestowed with Ranjana Bhalchandra Mardikar and Bhalchandra Prabhakar Mardikar memorial awards by Bhaiyyaji Joshi, general secretary of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at a programme organized by Mardikar family and Yuva Zep Pratishthan at Scientific Society Hall on Tuesday. 

 The award is being given since last four years to the citizens who have contributed for the betterment of society in a selfless manner. The award carries cash, book and a certificate.
 
 Speaking on the idea behind holding the event, Arvind Mardikar said, “After my parents passed away, I was thinking of doing something for the society. It was after talking to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat that we decided to institute an award in their memory.”
 
 Joshi appreciated Mardikar’s way of remembering his parents and said he has set an example before others to follow. “It is difficult to find people who are genuine in their work. Today, there are a lot of people who do welfare activities just to get recognized and rewarded. This is not correct. Social service should be done with a feeling that we owe something to the society,” he said.
 
 He emphasized the importance of understanding the requirements and needs while extending help, with the realization that the society is God. “Having sympathy with those who need help is important, but this emotion should not lead to disappointment, rather it should act as motivation to offer one’s best for a cause,” Joshi said. 
 
 “The attitude should be such that we feel that what we have done is not enough as this alone will continue to motive us to serve better. He also spoke highly of the people who lack resources and yet give away whatever they have.
 
 Leader of the ruling party in Nagpur Municipal Corporation Sandeep Joshi was present.
