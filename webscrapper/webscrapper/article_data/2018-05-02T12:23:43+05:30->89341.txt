 CHARMINAR:The Telangana State Waqf Board ( ) is pushing for a new   for the residents of Maqta Madaar within the Eidgah grounds.
 
 TSWB chairman Mohammed Saleem inspected the Edigah ground along with officials and area corporators, officials said.
 
 Saleem said that a representation was made by the board for laying a new road by local corporator near the Eidgah side as the open ground was being used by residents for last several years. However, he said that a decision would be taken after a board meeting with the CEO and it's members.
 
 "In case the railway gate is closed, the residents can take the Eidgah route as an alternative one. In this regard, a proposal was submitted to the TSWB for laying permanent road from the Eidgah land. Locals have also come forward for this cause, but the board CEO and it's members will discuss over the matter and then only a decision will be taken. No work can be undertaken without any consultations with board members,'' said TSWB Chairman Mohammed Saleem.
 
 In the wake of Shab-e-Barat, TSWB chairman Saleem said all mosques, graveyards committees and mutawallis ensured proper facilities in and around the mosques and graveyards on the night of Shab-e-Barat.
 
 "If anyone fails to carry out his work, then a show cause notice will be served by TSWB,'' added Saleem.
 
 P. Vijaya Reddy, TRS corporator said MS Maqta has two entrances, one on the railway gate and another one on open Eidgah ground. She added that a permanent road must be laid with help from TSWB.
