PATNA: Bihar chief secretary   has convened a video conference with all the DMs and SPs on February 3 to review preparations for the Class XII and Class X examinations to be conducted by the   (BSEB) from February 14 and March 1 respectively.
 
  The Class XII exams last year, it may be recalled, were marred by what was came to be known as ‘toper scam’ involving senior BSEB officials who were alleged to have helped undeserving students top the exam. An FIR was lodged and several people, including the then BSEB chairman   and his wife  , were jailed.
  
  According to BSEB sources, a number of measures have been initiated to ensure fair pre and post-examination processes. However, BSEB chairman   refused to divulge details. “We will be using latest technology to plug the loopholes, but right now I cannot disclose much,” he told TOI on Monday.
  
  In a first in the annual Board examinations, the sources said, answer sheets would be barcoded as they were done in the compartmental examinations held in November last year. That is, the names and roll numbers of examinees would be removed from the sheets before sending them for evaluation.
  
  This will be done under the supervision of newly appointed chief secrecy officer of ADM rank, deputy chief secrecy officer of deputy collector rank and a secrecy officer of supervisor rank. Neither any BSEB employee nor any teacher will be involved in this exercise.
  
  Around 16.61 lakh students will write the Class XII examination while 15.77 lakh pupils will appear at the Class X examination this year.
  
  Kishore said security would also be beefed up in the strong room where answer sheets would be stored after the examinations. “A number of changes have been made. We are hopeful we will conduct fair examinations,” he said.
