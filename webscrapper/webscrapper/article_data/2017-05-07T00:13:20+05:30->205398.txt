 A host of eminent Kolkatans will join former quizzers in a two-hour session that will trace O’Brien’s contribution towards launching the quiz movement and popularising it in the city. 
 
 His associates and quiz enthusiasts will recall his role and the almost single-handed effort that he had put in to turn mundane question-answer sessions into riveting contests. 
 
 Among those who will participate is Dilip Chatterjee who conducted the first sponsored quiz in the city. IPS and IAS officers like Sanjoy Mukherjee and Atree Bhattacharya, who are former quizzers, will be part of the event. The discussion will be interspersed by an informal quiz.
 
 “It will be an evening of tribute that will also recall O’Brien’s contribution to quizzing. He was a multifaceted personality who contributed immensely to the fields of education and quiz. The discussion will cover various aspects of his work. Quiz, of course, will be the centre point,” said O’Brien’s son Derek, a member of Rajya Sabha. The event will also see the release of O’Brien’s book ‘Calcutta Quiz Book’.
