The 24 finalists came prepared to impress the judges, who had a tough time choosing eight finalists who will get an opportunity to represent their respective states at the grand finale in Mumbai, which will air on Colors. The judges for the evening were fashion designer Ashish N Soni, boxer   and actors Patralekhaa and  . While  , who also mentored the north zone contestants, gave some dhaakad performance on stage, Abhay told the audience that in his upcoming film he is playing a Dilli ka munda. “This is my favourite city and I love coming here. I always feel I belong here,” said Abhay.

In the next round, they donned shimmering lehengas, dhoti pants and embroidered tops designed by Payal Singhal.

 The evening concluded with the announcement of the eight winners by Neha Dhupia. “It’s been a great journey and I have big shoes to fill, including that of Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar. I interacted with all 24 finalists and some of them are already winners, while some need grooming, some need more confidence, but they all were amazing and I saw a winner in each one of them. I told the contestants that what set Manushi apart was that she was very real and relaxed. So I keep telling them to be real,” said Neha.
