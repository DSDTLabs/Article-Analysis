NAGPUR: Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is set to attend a meeting in Delhi on May 8 to review the situation of   in Maharashtra. It will be chaired by Union home minister  

 On Wednesday, he took a review meeting in Mumbai. A day earlier, Addl DG (operations)   had convened a meeting of senior officials of the state’s Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) and police district chiefs of Gondia and Gadchiroli in Nagpur.
 
 It’s learnt that the district collectors of Gondia and Gadchiroli, who could not attend Tuesday’s meeting, rushed to Mumbai to update Fadnavis on Naxalite activities in their districts. 
 
 Top bureaucrats too have been engaged in assimilating facts and statistics related to   terrorism in Maharashtra. Gadchiroli district, in east Vidarbha, is considered as the most affected part of the state with traces of the rebel movement found in adjoining Gondia district too. 
 
 Sources stated that the Delhi meeting would help state in getting budgetary allocations for pending projects and proposed installations including armed outposts around Surjagarh mining area where Naxalites had last year burned 80 vehicles and brought work to a halt. 
 
 Apart from security installations, the state government is learnt to have undertaken several development projects in Gadchiroli taking advantage of the waning Naxal movement. With security forces now having a dominating position, the Fadnavis government is keen to consolidate developmental projects. 
 
 Addl DG (operations) Kanakratnam and newly inducted ANO-chief Sharad Shellar are also attended the meeting.
