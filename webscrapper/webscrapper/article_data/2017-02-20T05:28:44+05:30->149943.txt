 Director of education G P Bhat on Friday met  , who has been on a day-long hunger strike for 45 days now, outside the directorate of education premises in Porvorim. Bhat assured Busa of carrying out a fresh inquiry into his complaint, but Busa decided to continue his strike until action is initiated against the accused school principal.
 
  Busa sits on a day-long hunger strike from 9am to 6pm everyday.
  
  When Bhat visited Basu, former president of higher secondary teachers association and secretary of all India Congress committee Girish Chodankar was also present. Chodankar called for early resolution of the  .
  
  Busa’s daughters were students at Taleigao’s  , whose headmistress   was accused of harassment in 2014, by several parents. An FIR was filed and a case was also registered in the children’s court, with regards to this matter.
  
  Busa’s daughters have since been transferred to a different school, but he continues to hold vigil outisde the directorate of education, demanding Afonso’s removal in the interest of students.
  
  Earlier, speaking about the case, Bhat told TOI that “we cannot help him as his daughters are no longer studying in the school. We have done the needful and the school management has found nothing wrong, so how can we take action?”
  
  But, following a social media campaign highlighting Busa’s plight, authorities have changed their stance and have promised to reinvestigate the matter.
  
  Afonso, who was charged for alleged child abuse, has been discharged by Goa children's court for lack of evidence in the case.
  
  The school management had earlier said that it has begun to initiate action against its staff members who were involved in “hatching a conspiracy of filing false complaints” against the headmistress.
