Tiruvannamalai: Tension gripped the premises of the district administration office in   after a 27 year-old youth threatened to end his life by jumping off the roof of the collectorate, to register his protest against the police, for failing to take action against the murderers of his father on Tuesday evening.

 Collector K S Kandasamy, however, pacified the youth and brought him down the roof of the two-storey building. The incident created a flutter on the campus for nearly an hour.
 
 The youth, Dhayalan, son of Annamalai of Kudisaikarai village, told the collector that his father was murdered by staffers of the public distribution system (PDS) shop and brokers over enmity. He alleged that the police did not inquire into the death of his father properly, to arrest the perpetrators.
 
 The collector sent the youth home after assuring appropriate action by the police.
 
 According to police, Dhayalan’s father Annamalai had gone to attend the final rites of his relative in Gangapuram, which is located across the river, two days ago. However, he did not return home and was found dead in Cheyyar river on Tuesday. 
 
 Police sources added that Dhayalan and his family had a fight with the staff of the PDS shop in the village a few months ago, for giving less quanitities of rice. The staff reportedly assaulted and abused Dhayalan’s mother and father, who in turn, lodged a complaint with the police.
 
 The police registered a case regarding Annamali’s death and sent the body to government hospital for post-mortem. An inquiry was on in this regard.
