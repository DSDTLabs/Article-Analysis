 Mehta claimed that the effort would be to reduce costs by Rs 2,525 crore.
 
 On how the BMC would do it, he said, “For instance, the current system of separate cadres of stenographers, clerks, and telephone operators shall be discontinued. All these functions shall be carried out by having a single post of ex ecutive assistant.“
 
 “Similarly, there would not be separate drivers, labourers or chawiwalas in the water department, but the key operator will be given a vehicle with equipment, and he will drive and operate the water valves as well,“ said the civic chief.
 
 He also said that restrictions have already been imposed on granting overtime allowances to employees.“The feasibility of outsourcing services, wherever possible, shall be explored, and instructions have also been given to curtail unnecessary day-to-day expenditure,“ Mehta added.
 
 Asked about the anticipated opposition from the employees union, Mehta said, “We are neither touching nor cutting the existing staff, but the new staff which will be recruited in future will have to follow the new measures.“
