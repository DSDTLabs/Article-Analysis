LA PAZ (Bolivia): The Peruvian leg of   lived up to its billing of being the most demanding examination of the riders' skill and grit. 

 
 In particular, the long road to Arequipa, the last full day of rallying in the country, provided no respite. With a total of 774-km of Stage 5 — the longest yet of this year's Dakar yet — the tsunami-like dunes that were being left behind as the rally moved into Bolivia bore tales of crashes, broken legs, helicopter evacuations and withdrawals.
 
 Putting back the misfortune of inadequate fuel two days ago, CS   of Hero then suffered a crash, lost time but was driven enough to hop right back on and continue with his mission.
 
 Fellow Indian P Aravind of   was not so lucky as he didn't make it out to the more barren – and relatively safer – flatlands that the Bolivia leg would have offered. He crashed out with a suspected broken ankle.
 
 However,  , Dakar debutant with Hero, made light of the elements, flying over the sands to clock in his best stage of the Dakar yet, finishing at 11th position, his second top 15 stage finish. Overall, Mena now stands at 21st position at the halfway stage. "It was probably one of the toughest stage of the race," said Mena later, “I am really happy to finish well without any major mistakes." Teammate Santosh decided to play it safe to finish the stage at 52nd position.
