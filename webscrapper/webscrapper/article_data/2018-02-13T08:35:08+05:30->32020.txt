AMRITSAR: Despite repeated directions by the Sikh high priests to restrain the volume of loudspeakers at the gurdwaras during daily katha (discourse) or kirtan recital, many gurdwaras, run by the   ( ) and other bodies, continue to flout the Akal Takht’s edict.

 Many people and organizations had approached the   seeking directions for the   management committees to keep the volume of loudspeakers in check so as not to disturb the students or elderly living in the vicinity.
 
 SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh told TOI on Monday that they often send circulars to the gurdwaras managed by it asking their managers to keep the volume of loudspeakers low so that no one in the vicinity, especially the students and elderly get disturbed. He expressed helplessness in getting the Akal Takht directives implemented in the private gurdwaras. “We can only request other gurdwaras to abide by the Akal Takht edict,” he said.
 
 Then Jathedar of  , in an edict issued on November 23, 2005 had restricted the use of loudspeakers in gurdwaras.   had directed the gurdwara managements to set a volume limit of the speakers during kirtan, katha and recital of Gurbani so that it didn’t affect those living in nearby areas.
 
 As the Akal Takht kept receiving numerous complaints of violation of the edict, current Jathedar  , in a resolution adopted during the meeting of Sikh high priests on March 25, 2013, decided that gurdwaras should restrain the use of loudspeakers.
 
 Manager of a private gurdwara on Loharka Road, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “We keep the volume high only on the request of people living nearby. Of course during examinations or when there is some specific complaint, we lower the volume.”
