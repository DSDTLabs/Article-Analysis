Chennai: A division bench of the Delhi High Court has directed ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) to produce all relevant documents with regard to the moderation procedure followed by the institute for the final exam results. 

 The order dated March 9 has come in response to an appeal filed by a group of students after confusion prevailed on January 17 when results were declared.
 
 Several students who passed as per the first information on results they accessed found that they had failed a few hours later. ICAI clarified that an internal communication with branches was inadvertently shared publicly. The institute said that the results declared on the website were final and correct. Close to 5000 students are said to have been impacted. Over 20 students teamed up to file a writ petition with the Delhi High Court and post a hearing on February 6th, Judge Rekha Palli dismissed the petition. A group of 10 students went on to file an appeal with a division bench of the Delhi High Court. “We informed the court that the ICAI is a statutory body whose one decision or act affects a large number of students. Once de-codification of results takes place, any change is affected by personal bias and individual interestIn this case, the change has been made post de-codification,” said Vikas Nagwan, Juris Law Offices and the advocate for the appellant. The next hearing is scheduled for May 8 by when ICAI will be requiredhave to file relevant documents. As students get into preparation mode with the next set offor exams coming in May, several prominent voices in the CA fraternity like Vinod Gupta, Sunil Maggo and Vivek Khurana have openly shown support, asking students to focus on their studies while they manage the appellate process. ICAI did not respond to an email sent by TOI seeking a response.
