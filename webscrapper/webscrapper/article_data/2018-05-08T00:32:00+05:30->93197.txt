Application based bike taxi system is another option to passengers in Trichy, provided they are traveling alone. Launched in the city a month ago for the first time in the state, Rapido bike taxi has been witnessing an average of 200 bookings per day mostly from college students and working professionals to ride as pillions for short distances.

 The two-wheeler bike taxi is an application-based transport service that charges Rs 3 per km for every ride in city limits. Launched in March 2018, with a fleet strength of 80 two-wheelers, the bike taxi firm Rapido claimed that the demand in Trichy was way higher than the other cities in Tamil Nadu. "Demand for bike taxis has been increasing each day and many have become our regular customers. A lot of youngsters including, unemployed rural people prefer to join us as bike riders as they can earn up to Rs 800 a day," John Prakash, operation executive, Rapido told TOI. To join as a two-wheeler rider in the taxi network, one should have a valid driving license, a two-wheeler (2009 and later models) with registration certificate, and an android mobile phone as mandatory components whereas helmets will be given free of cost for both rider and pillion.
 
 "Most of our customers are office goers and students," John Prakash said. Though available in Coimbatore and Madurai but not yet in Chennai, the management of the bike taxi firm claimed that Trichy being a small city suits well for their operations and also receives more bookings than other tier-II cities. Meanwhile, auto drivers said that the app-based autos and bike taxis are a threat to their livelihood.
