NEW DELHI: A 32-year-old youth, who had gone out for a   on Tuesday morning, was found   beside a garbage dump behind a DDA market in Rohini. 

 Abhishek Jain’s body had stab wounds on the throat, and the hands and feet were bound with plastic tags. Police said he had left home around 5am without telling his wife or carrying his phone. Around 7am, passersby told the police about Jain’s body lying about 300 metres from his house near G Block, K N Katju Marg. He had a track suit and walking shoes on. 
 
 Police said Jain was probably strangled first and then stabbed; the limbs were then tied together and the body dumped. 
 
 Jain’s wife told the police that he wasn’t a morning walker, but would often go out for a smoke around 7am. He would usually return within 15 minutes. She said she thought he had gone out for a smoke, but had got worried when he didn’t return after two hours. They also found his slippers, which he usually wore while going out, lying outside the room.
 
 When Jain’s wife called him, she realised that the phone was at home. She then informed her father-in-law who drove around the colony looking for him. Police also said that while scanning Jain’s phone, they found that he had deleted the call logs and WhatsApp messages before leaving. Family members said he had slept pretty late too. 
 
 Jain had got married three years ago and had been staying on the ground floor of a house. He had quit his job at a private company. 
 
 Police suspect someone who owed Jain money may have killed him. They have detained a few suspects.
