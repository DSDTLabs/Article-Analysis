Bhopal: Water in   — the lifeline of the state capital that meets almost 40% of need — is not expected to last till June, according to   (BMC) estimates. Given the situation, the civic body has proposed to minimise supply of water from the Upper Lake and substitute the supply with Kolar reservoir. A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting of BMC mayor Alok Sharma and divisional commissioner  , recently.

 “Water from Kolar and Narmada would be utilised to cater to needs of the area, which get supply from the Upper Lake. The situation is under control,” said acting BMC commissioner MP Singh. 
 
 On Wednesday, water level in Upper Lake stood at 1655.97 feet. And it is not possible to draw water from the lake once it touches 1652 feet dead level. In last 20 days, water has reduced by half a foot. During summer heat, the water requirement and evaporation levels increase drastically. Upper Lake meets water requirement for almost 40% of city’s drinking water needs. 
 
 From approximately 30 million gallon per day (MGD) drawn from Upper Lake, the BMC aims to reduce it to 15 MGD, a move challenged by Bhopal North MLA Arif Aqueel, who recently challenged BMC claims over supply of water through Narmada water supply. “There needs to be an investigation in the failure to link Narmada supply as planned for the city. The BMC is harbouring those who are guilty of shortcomings and the matter should be investigated,” said Aqueel. “I would welcome any measure that would ensure twice a day   in Bhopal,” he said.
 
 Experts point out one of the water supply reservoirs are at an optimum level. Kolar dam is way off its full tank level of 462.20 metres. At present, it hovers are 440 metres. Narmada supply is the saviour. However, much of the connecting pipeline is way behind schedule. “Work to connect end users with Narmada pipeline is going on,” said Singh.
