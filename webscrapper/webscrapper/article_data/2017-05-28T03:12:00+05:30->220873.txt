Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has already received approval from the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA) for the first phase of a brand new CCP commercial complex.   CCP mayor, Surendra Furtado said that the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) will be responsible for the tender and execution of the project. The section of the building along the Atmaram Borkar road where the old BSNL office was situated, will be taken up in the first phase. According to the existing plan, four, six-storied buildings with a built-up area of 14,000sqm will be part of the complex. These buildings will be accessible from Dr Pandurang Pissurlekar road, 18th June road as well as Atmaram Borkar road. The complex will host CCP, existing 25 shops and a number of government offices. “Not a single inch of land will be rented or sold to any private entity,” Furtado said.  Three floors of parking are expected to accommodate 300 vehicles, with separate provisions for CCP’s trucks. The present space in the middle of the CCP complex where trucks are parked, will be converted into a lively open, green courtyard for musicians. CCP will also have a larger town hall.  The complex is expected to cost between Rs 40-50 crore, and the mayor has plans of making a presentation of the new CCP complex plan to the chief minister, TCP minister, North Goa collector and other officials, next week.
