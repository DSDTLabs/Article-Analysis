LUCKNOW: As over 300 MLAs were sworn in on Tuesday at Vidhan Bhawan, Bulandshahar MLA Sanjay Sharma, coming after 132 legislators, surprised everyone by taking oath in Sanskrit. However, once the first-time MLA did it, there were several who followed suit as protem speaker Fateh Bahadur Singh and four designated senior MLAs adminstered the oath.

 After Sharma, Bahraich MLA and basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal, too, read out her pledge in Sanskrit. Thereafter, it was a steady flow of legislators, including two city MLAs -- Suresh Srivastava (West) and Neeraj Bora (North) -- opting for the ‘dev-bhasha’ (language of gods). Satish Dwivedi, Chandrika Prasad Upadhyaya, Pawan Kedia, Dhananjay Kannaujia, Anand Swaroop Shukla, Sunil Verma, Mahendra Singh and Shashank Trivedi, they all had their pledge in Sanskrit. 
 
 Chief Minister  , too, was present in the house for sometime when the MLAs began taking oath. Atrauli MLA and former CM Kalyan Singh’s grandson, who is also a junior minister, had to repeat the pledge at least four times to complete it properly. Several other MLAs also faltered but blamed it on secretariat typing error in oath paper. 
 
 Those MLAs who could not make it on Tuesday, can take pledge on Wednesday and Thursday.
