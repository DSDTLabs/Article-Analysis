CHANDIGARH: With two of its prominent faces — state president Bhagwant   and Kharar MLA   — missing from AAP campaign of its candidate Rattan Singh Kakkar Kalan for the Shahkot byelection, the party leadership has decided to make up by pitching in other leaders.

 Both Mann and Sandhu are travelling abroad and party leaders maintained that they had taken a break after informing the party. They would return only after the campaign for the May 28 election is over. 
 
 Punjab AAP co-president Balbir Singh said the party’s campaign would not be lacklustre as party incharge of Punjab affairs Manish   would be holding a road show on May 24. Besides, he said, AAP’s leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh   too would be joining the campaign as he had also accompanied the candidate when he filed his nomination papers.
 
 “I too have been camping in the constituency and other MLAs will be taking turns to join the campaign in the coming days. The party candidate has a strong local connect and will give a tough fight to the Congress and Akali candidates,” he added. Party leaders added that though there was no plan to rope in party convener Arvind Kejriwal for now, the state unit would make such a request if BJP’s Amit Shah or Congress’s Rahul Gandhi holds an event in the bypoll, though it seemed unlikely.
 
 Meanwhile, former head of its NRI wing Jagtar Singh Sanghera was on Thursday appointed state secretary of the Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), along with six other office-bearers as part of an organization-building exercise.
 
 A former deputy general manager of Punjab Mandi Board, Sanghera has been associated with the party right from the start.
 
 Besides him, eight newly-appointed general secretaries are Dr Sanjiv Sharma, J P Singh, Dinesh Chadha , ETO Harbhajan Singh , Dr Kanwaljit Singh, Amarpal Singh , Sarbjot Singh Dhanjal and Sukhjinder Singh Pannu.
