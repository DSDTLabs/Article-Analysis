 We must keep railway station as clean as our homes,” she said.
 
 She inspected platforms, offices and also inspected catering units and issued necessary instructions to the concerned officers.
 
 She briefed the staff on significance of cleanliness and hygiene.
 
 Divisional railway manager (DRM) Parveen Gaur Dewedi said, “Archana Srivastava also inspected the platforms of Panchkula and found that the platforms are comparatively untidy as compared to first platform.
