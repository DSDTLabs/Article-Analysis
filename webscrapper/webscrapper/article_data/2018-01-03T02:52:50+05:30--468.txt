NEW DELHI: The body of a 21-year-old   was found floating in Yamuna on Tuesday afternoon. As he was suffering from severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression, police   that he could have committed suicide. They are probing other angles as well.

 According to police, a cleaner noticed the body and alerted them about it. A team went to the spot and the man’s picture in tattered clothes was circulated on all WhatsApp groups. Within the next few minutes, the man was found to be a resident of Lal Quila area.
 
 Police said that a missing person’s complaint was registered at Lal Quila police post and since then several police teams were working to trace him.
 
 “My brother Rishi had OCD. On December 22, he asked my mother to clean the washroom ten times and kept standing outside to check whether she did it properly. My mother started to cry but did not utter a word to him because she knew he was not mentally healthy. Like her, we had problems too but we never showed it to him. Despite this, he was aware that we too were affected and that troubled him. He tried committing suicide earlier too but we intervened on time,” said Amit Verma, Rishi’s brother.
 
 He added that his mother was cooking and everybody else was away for work when Rishi left home. “When I realised he was not around, I started searching for him. Later, we registered a complaint and today afternoon were asked to identify a body,” he said.
 
 “The first thing I noticed was a locket on the body. It was the same one that I had gifted to Rishi on his birthday a few months ago,” he said.
