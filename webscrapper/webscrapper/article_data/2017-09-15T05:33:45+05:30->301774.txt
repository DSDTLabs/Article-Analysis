LUCKNOW: Three   are among 35   inducted in party president Amit Shah’s team to work out a winning formula in 120   seats across the country where the saffron party has never won an election.

 The leaders have been asked to identify reasons why BJP lost these seats in 2014 despite the clear Modi wave and work out a plan to win them in 2019.
 
 Party sources said Union minister of state for railways, Manoj Sinha, and two   ministers — Mahendra Singh and Swatantra Deo – have been chosen for their exceptional organizational skills and their long experience in making strategies that help party candidates win elections.
 
 While Sinha, MP from UP’s Ghazipur district, has been assigned five Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, Swantra Deo has got six constituencies in Madhya Pradesh. Mahendra Singh, who is primarily an organisational man and has vast experience in managing rallies and party affairs, has been given the responsibility of six seats Maharashtra.
 
 Swatantra Deo Singh has been allotted five Lok Sabha seats of Madhya Pradesh. Singh, primarily an organisational man, has a vast experience in managing rallies and party affairs. Interestingly, Singh has never won a direct election. He unsuccessfully contested UP Assembly election from Orai in 2012. When Singh became a minister in the Yogi cabinet, he was not a member of either House of UP and got elected to Vidhan Parishad only last week. 
 
 Mahendra Singh, who is also a BJP national secretary, has been allotted six Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. With Singh as party’s Assam incharge, BJP formed its first government in the northeast state in 2016. 
 
 While Manoj Sinha and Swatantra Deo Singh have already visited the states allotted to them, Mahendra Singh is expected to visit Maharashtra soon, sources said.
