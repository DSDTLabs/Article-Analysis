AHMEDABAD: After abolishing the subsidy for   pilgrims, the central government on Tuesday announced a drastic reduction in the air fare for the pilgrims who are bound to go to   on Haj this year.

 Minister for the minority affairs   said that the air ticket from Ahmedabad to   or   would cost Rs 65,015. The fare was Rs 98,750 during the pilgrimage in 2013-14. Similarly, the air fare from Mumbai to the pilgrimage centre will be nearly Rs 75,857. The chairman of Gujarat State Haj Committee, Mohammed  , welcomed the decision.
 
 In 2012, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to phase out the system of subsidy for the Haj pilgrimage. The subsidy was adjusted for the pilgrims in air fare. On the other hand, the government was also criticized by many for charging more from the pilgrims for the flight than Air India charges in normal course.
