LUCKNOW: The ongoing cash crisis at ATMs in the city and beyond has dented   sales majorly.

 Though the number of customers at jewellery shops was high on the occasion which is considered auspicious to buy gold, sale of the yellow metal and silver was disappointing compared to the record of many years.
 
  
  
 
 Jewellers in Lucknow were able to sell around 27kg of gold this year compared to 30kg in 2017. Sale of silver was also down as just about 85kg was sold compared to last year’s 110kg on the day.
 
 Another reason for the slump in business was attributed to the cost of gold. The price of gold shot to Rs 32,490 per 10gm on Wednesday, against last year’s rate of Rs 30,490 per 10gm on the festival.
 
 The price of silver, however, was low at Rs 41,000 per kg compared to Rs 41,500 last year. Even that, though, did not boost sales.
 
 For jewellers, a big shocker was that bullion and coins saw no takers.   secretary   told TOI, “It is very rare that bullion and coins experience such slump in sale. People are reluctant to invest in gold now. Only those customers are coming who have to buy ornaments for weddings or for gifting. All this buying is out of compulsion.”
 
 A shopkeeper in   said, “Bullion sale is insignificant this year. In no year has the category seen such a collapse. Only lighter ornaments like nose rings, earrings and finger rings have been bought by consumers to mark the occasion.”
 
 Jewellers are also attributing the slowdown to poor cash availability. They claim that since people are not getting enough cash from ATMs or banks, their spending capacity has reduced.
