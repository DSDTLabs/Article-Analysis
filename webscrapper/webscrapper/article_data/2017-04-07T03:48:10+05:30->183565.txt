NEW DELHI: Foreign minister   on Thursday said India had all the credentials to become a permanent member of the   and four permanent members, the US, the UK, France and Russia, had extended support to its bid. 

  The fifth member, China, had "not publicly opposed it," she said. The minister said India was expecting that new members would have the same rights, including the veto power enjoyed by the existing permanent members. 
 
  During question hour in Rajya Sabha, Swaraj said, "I am confident that if not this time, then next time, India will become a permanent member of the Security Council." 
 
 To a question whether India would also get 'veto' power, she said the country wants the same responsibilities, prerogatives as well as obligations as the current permanent members.
 
 "We don't want any discrimination between old and new members. We don't want two classes - that there is a first class and a second class of permanent members. This should make it clear that India wants the same responsibilities, prerogatives and obligations as the current permanent members," Swaraj said.
 
  She said India had been making diplomatic efforts to ensure not only expansion but also reform in the Security Council. The minister argued that India wanted expansion of its permanent as well as non-permanent membership of the council. 
 
  In her reply tabled in the House, Swaraj said on the issue of extending veto powers to new permanent members in their submission during the inter-governmental negotiation process of the 69th General Assembly, the US and the UK had opposed extension of veto to new members. 
 
  France supported the extension while Russia and China did not make any submission on the issue, she said.
