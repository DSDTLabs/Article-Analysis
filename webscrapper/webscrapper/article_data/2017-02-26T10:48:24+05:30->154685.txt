HYDERABAD: The   (TPCC) on Saturday took a serious view of chief minister  's “idiots“ and “bandits“ remarks. TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and other senior party leaders said they would pay KCR in his own coin if he did no desist from spewing venom against the Opposition.

 The Congress leaders accused KCR and his family of “robbing“ the wealth of Telangana through “dubious“ means. Besides Uttam Kumar Reddy, AICC secretary  , leaders of Opposition K Jana Reddy (Assembly) and   (Council), TPCC former chief Ponnala Lakshmaiah, its working president   and vice-president Mallu Ra vi addressed a press conference at Gandhi Bhavan here. They condemned the chief minister's remarks against Congress leaders at a press conference in Mahbubabad district on Friday.
 
 The TPCC chief said KCR stooped to the “lo west level“ in targeting the Opposition parties and their leaders to “justify his wrong actions“. He strongly objected to the language and tone used by him against the Opposition.
 
 “The donation of gold ornaments worth more than `6 crore to various temples from the Common Good Fund is illegal and the Congress has rightly condemned the decision. It is not appropriate for the chief minister to donate crores of rupees from the public exchequer while keeping the fee reimbursement dues pending,“ he added.
