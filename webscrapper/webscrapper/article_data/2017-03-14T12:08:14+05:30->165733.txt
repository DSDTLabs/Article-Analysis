THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finance minister T M   informed the assembly on Monday that the   that failed to complete their projects in time would be able to carry over the   to next financial year.

 “The only condition is that the local bodies should have commenced the projects already. The funds of the projects that are yet to begin will be lapsed,’’ said Isaac in reply to members of the house who pointed out that several civic bodies were unable to complete works of various projects that have been started already. 
 
 However, P K Basheer of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) said in the assembly that the model code of conduct that was enforced in Malappuram in view of the bypoll has severely affected plan fund utilisation. 
 
 He pointed out that now no local body in the district was able to use the funds due to this.
 
 In reply to this, local self-government minister K T Jaleel said the government has taken the issue seriously and would soon decide on a special arrangement on plan fund utilisation for the district. 
 
 He said with only 15 days left for the present financial year to end, the local self-government department has used only 34% of the total plan funds so far.
 
 After the   government came to power, 1,494 new posts have been created in the local self-government department. 
 
 Of the 30 vacancies of secretaries, 19 have been filled. The minister assured that it has been decided to set up modern slaughterhouses in every block across the state. “The setting up of abattoirs will be completed within five years,” the minister informed the assembly. tnn
