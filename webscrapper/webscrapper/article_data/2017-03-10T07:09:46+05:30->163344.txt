The swamp is yet to be filled,” said MS Kocchar, one of the residents at Central Park resorts. TOI had earlier reported that even weeks after Parvesh died, the local civic authorities took no action. Residents had alleged that they had been pressing the authorities for action on the swamp but to no effect. 
 
 According to the residents, they had filed several complaints with the MCG to clear the swamp in the area. When contacted, MCG officials said the area is a private land and falls under Huda in Sector 48.
 
 The boy, Parvesh, was playing with local kids in an empty plot behind the slum when he fell into the swamp on February 7.
