SURAT: Shankarsinh  , former leader of opposition in state assembly, who recently left   and floated Jan Vikalpa party to provide another alternative to people in the upcoming elections, lambasted the   government in Gujarat over corruption.

 Addressing reporters here on Tuesday, Vaghela said, “Town Planning (TP) schemes are biggest source of corruption for BJP. They take away 40 per cent of owners’ land when there can’t be more than 30 per cent deduction for public amenities.” 
 
 Vaghela said demonetization had hit the small businessmen hard. The government then implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST) which further clobbered the economy. He said GST should be suspended for 18 months and then brought in slowly. “Demonetization and GST have caused huge losses to diamond and textile sectors in the city. This government is not ready to listen to anyone. People are not being given permission to take out rallies and any opposition to the government is brutally crushed by the authorities. Law is there to help people and not to instil a sense of fear in them. The situation is such that not only businessmen, but even labourers are scared and running away from their places of work everywhere.” 
 
 He said people have opted for another party other than Congress and BJP in many states. Vaghela said if his Jan Vikalpa comes to power in Gujarat, his government would pay minimum support price of Rs 1,200 per quintal for groundnut and Rs 1,500 per quintal for cotton. He also promised reduction of VAT by 10 per cent on petrol and diesel. Vaghela also promised unemployment allowance of Rs 3,000 per month for youths who are class XII pass, Rs 4,000 for graduates and Rs 4,500 for PhDs with job offers within 100 days to them. 
 
 The Jan Vikalpa leader also announced to give 50 per cent relief in electricity bills to farmers and 30 per cent to domestic consumers.
