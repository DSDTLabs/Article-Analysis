Chennai: With ATM density on average at 1 machine for every 5,500 citizens, it translates into a machine every 60 km, while in Canada it is one every 545 citizens. Industry data, shows there is just 1 ATM for every 9,174 residents residents in rural areas, while there is 1 ATM for every 1,512 residents in India's metros. “Villagers also have to contend with the scarcity of bank branches. Only public-sector banks like State Bank of India have sizeable presence in rural areas, but private banks are mostly urban-centric,” said Loney Antony, managing director, Hitachi Payment Services Pvt. Ltd. Of India’s total ATM network of 2.4 lakh, only 17% machines are in rural areas servicing nearly 65% of the population, according to RBI data as of December 31, 2017. About 1.20 lakh ATMs (50%) are in urban and semi-urban locations and another 17% in semi-rural areas. “Rural India is largely underserved since banks were not keen on expansion. It was white-label operators that expanded into rural areas. But demonetisation pushed costs sky-high for the ATM industry, the business became unviable and the network shrunk,” says Antony of Hitachi, which had to slash its ATM network by half to 637 by February 2018 from 1,276 two years ago. Other white-label operators like RiddhiSiddhi Bullions have also had to bring down their ATM network to 128 from 210 post-demonetisation. Only larger players like Tata Communications Payment and BTI Payments have been able to expand their network. “In urban locations, ATMs are refilled every day. In rural areas, ATMs are replenished once in 2-3 days. These ATMs also run dry faster as they have to service a lot more people,” said Sanjeev Patel, CEO, Tata Telecommunication Payments. In certain remote locations, the ratio becomes even more skewered and there is just 1 ATM for every 200 km. For instance CMS Infosystems has an ATM in Drass, Jammu and Kashmir located 7,000 feet above sea level. There is also the problem of violence and robbery — affecting people’s access to cash in Naxal-affected areas like Pakhanjore, Kondagaon, Bacheli, ATM vans are stopped and raided at gun-point. In Jharkhand. For 2017, states like Jharkhand (Rs 1.58 crore), Bihar (Rs 3 crore), Haryana (Rs 4 crore) lost more money from robberies and ATM fraud than states like Tamil Nadu (Rs 79 lakh), Karnataka (Rs 98 lakh). The political unrest and lack of infrastructure are also reasons behind why ATM penetration is low in states like Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and high in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This disparity between the different states and the government's anti-cash digital policy has put India way behind its Asian counterparts. When its comes to a measure of ATMs per million country-wise, India on average 1 ATM for every 5,555 citizens, lagging behind South Korea (1 ATM:400 citizens), China (1 ATM: 1,858 citizens) and Singapore (1 ATM: 2,000 citizens) Even developed nations like Canada (1ATM: 545 citizens), France (1 ATM: 573 citizens), UK and Japan (1 ATM: 929 citizens) are still cash-dependent and continuing to invest in ATM infrastructure.
