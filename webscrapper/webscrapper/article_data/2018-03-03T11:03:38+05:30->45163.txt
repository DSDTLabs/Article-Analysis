NAGPUR: The highest collective decision making body of the RSS -   (ABPS) - is meeting in the city on March 9-11. There are indications that the current RSS Sarkaryavah   will step down and   (in picture) will be elected in his place. It is the ABPS which gives a sort of democratic colour to the otherwise non-transparent and closed nature of the RSS. Around 1,500 representatives of various constituents of the   get together for ABPS annually at different venues in the country. But once in three years, ABPS meets in Nagpur, the RSS headquarters. What makes the Nagpur ABPS crucial is the election for the post of Sarkaryavah that takes place during the meet. 

 Bhaiyyaji Joshi has been in the post for last nine years. In 2015 ABPS at Nagpur, Hosabale's name had cropped for the post. But it was dropped for some reasons and Joshi was handed out another term. Now in his early 70s, Joshi is grappling with some health problems and wants to step down, sources said. Known as politically more pragmatic, there are some in the RSS who feel that Hosabale is closer to the Modi-Shah duo who rule the country and hence his appointment to the no.2 position would mean further politicisation of the RSS. But there are others who feel that Hosabale, in his 60s, would be a dynamic force and help attracting the youth support.
