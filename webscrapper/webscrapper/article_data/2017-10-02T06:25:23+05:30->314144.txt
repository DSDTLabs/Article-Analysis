CHENNAI:   may have some advice for fellow-actor   Haasan, who recently announced his plans to enter politics.Speaking on Sunday at the inauguration of the memorial of   in  , where the two stars shared the stage, Rajinikanth said, "To succeed in politics, fame and wealth alone are not enough."

 "Sivaji Ganesan taught his followers a valuable lesson in politics," Rajinikanth said, even as he lauded the late star's acting prowess. "He started his own party , contested elections and lost in his own constituency."
 
 (Kamal recently said he intended to start his own party.) Rajinikanth said "there needs to be something more than fame and wealth" for success in politics. "Only the people know what that is. I promise I don't know. I think Kamal Haasan knows what that is. Even if he does he will not tell me," he joked to an audience of nearly 100 politicians, actors, reporters and fans who had packed a hall at the site as many more movie buffs gathered outside.
 
 Kamal would have told him what that is, Rajinikanth said, had he asked him two months earlier. Kamal had in July started attacks on "corruption" in government. "When I asked him what that is, Kamal Haasan said that he will tell me if I joined him," Rajinikanth said.
 
 Kamal, who took the stage next, did not comment on Rajinikanth's speech.
 
 "Sivaji is an actor who transcended state, national and continental boundaries," he said. "Even if I had not become an actor, I would have been at this event as a film lover."
 
 Kamal said he was one of thousands of actors trying desperately to achieve the standards Sivaji had set. "Any government that comes to power will have to respect this great actor."
 
 Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam inaugurated the memorial and the function largely turned out to be what it was meant to be: a tribute to a legendary actor.
 
 South Indian Artistes' Association president Nasser said, "This memorial is only a symbol. Sivaji resides in the hearts of seven crore Tamils."
