GURUGRAM: The district administration has announced up to 80%   on harvesting machines as part of its efforts to check stubble burning, considered to be one of the major contributing factors behind high pollution levels in the region especially during winters.

 The administration has also planned a series of awareness camps — from May 25 to June 15 — to educate farmers about various   available in the market and subsidies offered by the government.
 
 On Tuesday, while announcing the benefits, deputy commissioner   appealed to farmers to switch to mechanized harvesters — these machines chop off crops from roots, leaving behind smaller stubble.
 
 “The government is going to organise awareness camps for paddy farmers from May 25 to June 15. Farmers who are interested in purchasing subsidized machines will have to fill in a form by June 30. State officials will supply the machines by September 30,” said Singh.
 
 Officials said around 50% subsidy was being offered on machines like super straw management system, paddy straw chopper shredder, shrub master, reversible MB plough, rotary slasher, zero till seed drill etc. Also, up to 80% subsidy was available on some harvesters, they added.
 
 They said prices of such machines ranged from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 75 lakh, which could be purchased jointly by a group of farmers too. 
 
 Also, Farmer Produce Organisation will set up around 900 centres across the state to provide such machines on rent. Last year, 420 such centres were set up.
