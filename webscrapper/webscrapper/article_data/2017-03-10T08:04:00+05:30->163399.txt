NEW DELHI: Dharampal can finally smile. The owner of  , he had been at the centre of a legal storm since 2012. Now, the storm has blown over and his humble shop is still standing. 

 It was a   teacher who first broke the good news to him on Thursday that the publishers had withdrawn their case. A group of students who were present at the shop at that time broke into a spontaneous cheer.
 
  “I’m very happy with the decision and I believe that the media has played a part in this with their positive reporting. The last four-and-a-half years were tiresome and I was mentally harassed and financially affected because of the fear of these multinational companies,” Dharampal told TOI. 
 
 The publishers’ association said in a joint statement: “We continue to stand by our principles stated throughout this case. We support and seek to enable equitable access to knowledge for students and we understand and endorse the important role that course packs play in the education of students. We support our authors in helping them produce materials of the highest standard and we maintain that copyright law plays an important part in balancing the interests of those creating, curating, and disseminating learning materials with those requiring access to them.”
 
 “We look forward to working even more closely with academic institutions, teachers and students to understand and address their needs, while also ensuring that all those who contribute to and improve India’s education system—including authors and publishers—continue to do so for the long term.” 
 
 Thanking the publishers, Dharampal said: “This is a decision in students’ interest and the publishers should be thanked for that, though I have been through a lot in this period.”
