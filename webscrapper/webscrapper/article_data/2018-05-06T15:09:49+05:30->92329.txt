Parades, stunts, b-boying, EDM shows… the Motorbike Fest that has just been kicked off at Nedumbassery on May 6 is not just all about the mean machines. 

 The programme, which was inaugurated today morning by Anwar Sadat MLA, also has two world class DJs – Diego Miranda and Candice Redding, all set to make the city dance to their tunes in the evening. Hundreds of superbikes, vintage and classic bikes, custom and stroke bikes will also be on display at the show, which also has a riders café for the visitors. Alongside some fun with bikes, dance and music, visitors can also check out the events of arm wrestling, throttling and burnout which will be held today.
