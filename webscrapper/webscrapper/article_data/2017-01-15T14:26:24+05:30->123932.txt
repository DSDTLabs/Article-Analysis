SRINAGAR: The   have further scaled down their ongoing agitation by restricting the strike call to every Friday and have asked people to observe a 'black day' on Republic Day.

 In a fresh protest programme issued late last night, the separatists - hardline Hurriyat chairman  , moderate Hurriyat chief   and JKLF chief Yasin Malik - asked the people to observe strike only on Fridays.
 
 After the unrest broke out in the Valley following the killing of   militant Burhan Wani in July last year, the separatists have been issuing regular protest programmes. The protests have died away since November and the separatists restricted the strike to Friday and Saturday every week.
 
 In view of Republic Day, the separatists have called for a shutdown on Thursday as well this week. They have also called for joint protest on Monday after the afternoon prayer.
