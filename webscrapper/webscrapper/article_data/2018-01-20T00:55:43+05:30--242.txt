Kota: The state and Central government are totally indifferent to the grievances of the public and are focused on paving way for industrialists and business houses to earn money, alleged senior   and former minister of the state Bharat Singh on Friday after handing over a memorandum to the representatives of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) at Simliya toll plaza on NH-76. 

 Earlier in the day, Congress workers led by Singh held a meeting in Simliya town and later led a peaceful march to toll plaza at Simliya on NH-76. At toll plaza, Congress workers, lodging protest against NHAI officials and state government handed over a memorandum addressed to CGM-cum-RO, NHAI, to the representative of NHAI demanding re-carpeting and mending of NH-76, which is dotted with ditches and potholes. Speaking to TOI, Singh said as per the condition, NH-76 had to be re-carpeted and mended in 2015 but the work has not been carried out till today.
