NEW DELHI: As many as 539 families of street artists have left   near   in   and shifted to a transit camp to make way for Delhi Development Authority’s   on the site. DDA, which owns the land, had started issuing demolition slips to the colony residents December 19 onwards.

 Initially, the authority had to face criticism from residents and evacuation took place under heavy presence of paramilitary and police personnel, but they have not been facing much protests now. On Sunday, the authorities only demolished five houses. So far, over 400 houses have been razed.
 
 JP Agarwal, DDA principal commissioner (housing), said that residents have started realising that their interest lies in moving out of the settlement for a better lifestyle. “Many of them willingly moved out of the colony. The transit camp has far better facilities for them. They are being given beds, clothes, food and all other necessities to help them tackle adverse weather conditions,” he said.
 
 The residents who are not willing to move out of the area have expressed many concerns.
 
 “We are being asked to move out even though we have spent half our lives here. Our house was razed without our permission. My husband was away and the house next to mine was to be demolished, but the authorities even razed ours. I sent two of my daughters to their grandparents’ house as they fell ill due to the rain and cold,” said 22-year-old Vandana, a mother of four kids.
 
 Dilip Bhat, a leader of the community, said that a public toilet was also demolished on Sunday. “The area has anyway been neglected and lacks proper sanitation. The authorities shouldn’t have demolished the toilet as many people used it. Not everyone can build a toilet in their small homes,” he said.
