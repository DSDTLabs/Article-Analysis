In an interview with TOI, Madurai district superintendent of   N Manivannan talks about steps being taken against ganja peddlers and the measures taken to cut the availability of ganja to students.

 
 
 
 We came to know that ganja use is prevalent in the district and is spreading to the youngsters. We have formed a special team to tackle the menace and instructions have been given to the officers. After a few months of strict vigil, the intensity has come down. Our aim, however, is to bring it to zero.
 
 
 
 
 Many of the peddlers have been in the business for many years now. They are now reluctant to take up other jobs. We are ready to rehabilitate them if they were ready. At present the eradication drive is in full swing and once it is completed we will start the rehabilitation. With the help of banks, loans will be arranged for them to take up some other business.
 
 
 
 
 Earlier, it used to be cultivated in Western Ghats in Theni. It was wiped out by police many years ago. The peddlers now procure it from   and transport it to the state using various ways such as private vehicle, public transport and even parcel service. Unless, there is a specific info it is difficult to seize them. We have our own sources for that.
 
 Not just adults, students easily get access to ganja…
 
 We have taken all measures to clamp it. Special branch police is closely monitoring all the institutions. Once the kingpins are controlled they won’t be able to get it. Students should stay away from bad habits and focus on studies.
 
 Activists say that the peddling cannot take place without the collusion of police
 
 Stern action will be taken against the police personnel if they are found to have involved in such activities. Many have already faced it. Many such men have been transferred to other districts and they cannot work in any station in the same sub-division again.
