Panaji: Long queues and multiple visits to the directorate of transport offices may be a thing of the past with the department taking the initiative to dispatch driving licenses and registration certificate (RC) books in the form of smart cards directly to the applicants’ residence.

 After submitting the form applicants will get SMS updates about the status of their application until the smart cards are delivered to their residence by speed post. The department decided to implement this citizen-friendly measure following complaints it received from the public about having to make numerous visits to   offices to collect their smart cards. 
 
 Applicants, who presently pay Rs 50 as facilitation fee, will now have to pay an additional Rs 30 to receive their smart cards at their homes. The department is working in coordination with India post to ensure rapid dispatch of smart cards by speed post.
 
 Goa Electronics Limited (GEL) will manage the system and send SMS alerts, prepare smart cards and hand these over to the postal department on a daily basis for onward   to applicants. 
 
 Those who have already applied for licenses can opt to receive their cards by speed post, director of transport Nikhil Desai told TOI, adding that applicants will receive their smart cards within 24-28 hours once handed over to the postal department.
 
 The system is expected to be put in place by next week. “We will soon extend this initiative to other categories of services. The idea is to go paperless and reduce queues and crowds at the departments offices considering the magnitude of applications that the department receives,” he said. Last year the department issued a little under 27,000 smart card licenses.
