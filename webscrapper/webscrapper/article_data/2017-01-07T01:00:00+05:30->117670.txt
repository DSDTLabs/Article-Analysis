But unfortunately, the actor will no longer be a part of the show. The production house felt that Raza was looking a bit older for the role and therefore, informed him about their decision to replace him. Raza said, “I am not disappointed but my only grouse is that they did this after doing around three look tests. I also shot with them for two days and it was an extensive schedule. How can they throw me out after shooting with me for two days? I don’t mind being replaced because of my age as I 
can't fight my age, but they should have thought about it when they chose me first. ”
