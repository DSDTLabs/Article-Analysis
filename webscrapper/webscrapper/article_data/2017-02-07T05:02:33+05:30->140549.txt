Three fishermen, who were travelling in a boat that was hijacked by the   involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, were finally declared dead eight years after the incident. 

 A civil court in Navsari ordered the Gujarat government to issue death certificates to the kin of the three fishermen killed by the Pakistani terrorists.
 
 Five fishermen were on board 'Kuber' when their fishing boat was hijacked off the coast of Saurashtra by   and other Pakistani terrorists. Only the body of Amarsinh Solanki, the captain of the boat from Valsad, was found. Ramesh Solanki of Junagadh, Natwar alias Natu Nanu Rathod,   and Balvant Tandel from Vansi-Borse and Dandi villages in south Gujarat remain missing till date. The family members of Balvant, Natu Rathod and Mukesh Rathod came to terms that they had died. However, the state government was not ready to accept their submission as their bodies were yet to be found.
 
  This deprived the families compensation of Rs 3 lakh and other benefits given to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks. Damyanti Tandel, wife of Balvant, Natu's wife, Dharmistha, and Mukesh's grandmother, Lakshmi, had approached the civil court in January 2016. Additional civil judge R G Yadav declared the fishermen dead and ordered the authorities to issue death certificates to their families under the Special Relief Act. The families had approached Navsari district collector in 2015, seeking help before approaching the court. "The family members of the deceased approached the civil court in January 2016 as the fishermen had been missing since 2008. The families submitted in their applications that the fishermen be declared dead," district government pleader Tushar Sule said.
