 and   have forever remained arch-rivals, and things started becoming evident ever since Ranbir cheated on DP with Kat. At every interview, the two leading ladies of   dodge questions about their each other and refuse to comment anything related to their rival.

 But looks like Deepika’s beau   doesn’t like the soured relationship that the contemporaries share and so he is all out to mend things between them.
 
 A close source revealed to a leading daily, “The two actresses had a fallout over their ex  . It is only fitting that Deepika’s current beau sorts this problem out. Even if they don’t become friends, they can at least be cordial to each other in public. Like Salman Khan and Abhishek Bachchan and like Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor. Enough time has passed for the two actresses to now put their past behind them. Ranveer, who has become very fond of Katrina, is keen that the two actresses call a truce. Ranveer and Kat like and even follow each other on Instagram.”
 
 That is quite sweet of Ranveer to have an intervention between the Deepika and her so-called nemesis Katrina Kaif.
 
 We too hope that Ranveer succeeds in his efforts.
