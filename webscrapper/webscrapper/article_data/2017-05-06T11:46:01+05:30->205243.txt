CHANDIGARH: Aiming to inculcate a   among children, a   called `Cubs club' is set to begin its `Pass it on' campaign in   Initiated in 2016, the campaign has so far been limited to two schools -St. Soldier's School in Sector 16, Panchkula, and DAV school, Sector 15, Chandigarh.

 Under this initiative, a group of privileged or affluent students help poorer classmates by donating items of daily use -it could be stationery , books, school bags, pouches, or clothes. They are donated directly to needy children every now and then.
 
 Though the NGO started the drive in 2016, it was first launched by the club's founder and convenor Meenu Prashar and her daughter in 2012.
 
 “I lost my husband 10 years ago, and since then, I have raised my daughter on my own and wish to incorporate philanthropic values in her,“ Prashar said. “This initiative represents my desire to make every privileged child realize what he or she has, and make them learn the art of giving.“
 
 Students who've been part of this project shared how it has changed them. “I have no words to express my feelings about my first slum visit in Sector 8, when I donated all types of daily items to 20 poor kids who hardly get to eat two meals a day ,“ said St Soldier's school captain,  . “I have also written a poem in Hindi to motivate other school children and make them realize the need to give.“
 
 “That moment, I realized how lucky we are,“ said its vicecaptain,  .“We get nutritious food to eat, expensive clothes to wear, and most importantly , such amazing educational facilities.“
 
 Aishvarya, a class XII student at DAV , said: “I have learned the art of being content in life by interacting with underprivileged kids of the areas the Cubs' Club caters to.I have realized materialistic things are not the true source of happiness, but human relations and emotions are.“
