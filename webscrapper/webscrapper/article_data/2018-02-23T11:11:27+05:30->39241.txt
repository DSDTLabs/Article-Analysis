BHOPAL: A class 11 student was allegedly beheaded in front of her school in Kotma village — 30km from   — on Thursday, by a man who had been   her for years and was spurned. The accused was arrested later in the day.

 The victim, Pooja Panika, had her biology practicals at 1pm. She was on her way to school around 12.30pm when the accused ran up to her and attacked her, said a retired teacher, so far the only eyewitness. He hacked her neck thrice with a sword, severing it. Pooja died on the spot while the killer dropped the sword and fled.
 
 The teacher raised an alarm and police were summoned. None of the students witnessed the murder as they were inside the school. Teachers kept students away from the gory crime scene until police removed the body, sword and all traces of blood. Soon after, cops arrested a suspect — Dilip Sahu — from his residence on the basis of statements given by Pooja’s family.
