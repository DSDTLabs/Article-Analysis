NOIDA: Work remained suspended at  's Noida assembling centre for the third consecutive day following a massive protest against the alleged disrespect to the Indian tricolour by a Chinese officer of the company. The officer was sacked by Oppo on Wednesday. 

 The Noida police said that they were examining the company's   footage which shows the Oppo production manager, identified as Suhahu, throwing 'something' from the table into the dustbin. The footage, however, is not clear enough to establish what was thrown into the bin. 
 
 Suhahu is accused by Indian employees of the company of tearing up a poster with a picture of the Indian national flag and throwing it in a bin. The employees protested and demanded strict action against the officer.
 
 The company on Wednesday issued a statement saying that it has zero-tolerance for such incidents.
 
 Police have asked the accused person, who has been at large since the day of the incident, to join the investigation.
