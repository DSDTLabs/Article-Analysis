AGARTALA:  , a senior minister of   government, slammed the Centre's decision to abolish the  , while addressing a statehood day event on Sunday. He said the Centre's move has widened the gap between the state and the Centre. 

 "The state had received Rs 3,200 crore to speed up its development activities. It was a major boost for the state, but with the decision to abolish the Planning Commission, Tripura, along with 12 states, lost their special category tag. It came as a big blow for these states," Chowdhury said.
 
 Flaying the Modi-led government on demonetisation, he said the state government welcomes such moves but Centre's method of making the move work clearly reveals its lack of preparation. He added that cashless economy could hardly be successful in a country like India where 30 crore people are still illiterate. 
 
 Participating in the discussion, governor Tathagata Roy praised the Centre for its approach to address the holistic development of the country.
 
 He said Tripura has a long way to go especially in the field of employment generation. "There should be a sustained effort to become self-reliant and skill development plays a key role to achieve this. Depending on the Centre for dole will not help the state develop in all sectors," Roy said.
 
 The governor said, "The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNERGA) was implemented to provide jobs to millions of poor people but there should be sustained efforts to bring about a real change in the life of common people by making them skilled."
