HYDERABAD: The   president Shiva Vulkundakar ended his six-day hunger strike at the   on Tuesday. 

 However, the cab drivers refused to yield in their demands and said that they will take the legal route and battle it out in the courts.
 
 “We thank all who have supported us. But we will not stop until our pending demands are met. We are already planning our next course of action,“ Shiva said in a brittle voice. He broke his fast as he will leave for Sabarimala soon.
 
 Highly-placed sources said that the cab drivers will take up the issue with the ministry of road transport and highways in Delhi. Meanwhile, both Uber and Ola's operations have been restored in the city.
 
 Uber spokesperson Ruchika said, “We have been addressing the issues of cab drivers on an individual basis. We have been hiring new cab drivers and have also retained some of the old ones. Our strategy in providing the cab services will not change in any way.“ G Ramesh, the Uber dri ver who tried to set himself ablaze at the Panjagutta flyo ver, said, “My family has been plagued by debts and I was not able to pay for diesel or EMIs. I didn't know what to do. That is why I smashed my own car and was going to kill myself.“
 
 Retired Judge Chandra Kumar and   (CITU) state secretary Sai Baba were present at the hospital to extend support to the agitating cab drivers. “It is cruel that neither the blind government nor the cab aggregators have responded to their protests.From  's side, we will participate in their battle for rights,“ Sai Baba said.
 
 Justice Chandra Kumar said that the government has a moral responsibility to tell the cab aggregators to resolve the issue without destroying the cab drivers' livelihoods in any way.
 
 “From the government's reaction, we have understood that they are on the side of the corporates and have prefered to disown the debt-ridden drivers despite their protests and hunger strike led by the drivers,“ Chandra Kumar said.
