 Highly placed sources in the home department and in the city police said that at about 1am on Monday, Togadia had told his Z-plus security escort to come to VHP office on Monday noon.
 
 “Meanwhile an ASI and a constable of Rajasthan police approached Sola police station with an arrest warrant in a case registered at Ganganagar of Savai Modhapur district, Rajasthan. A Sola police team with Rajasthan police went to Togadia’s residence at about 10.30 am,” said a police official.
 
 Around 10.45 am on Monday morning, Togadia and a bearded VHP man told the security staff from the State Reserve Police (SRP), Vikramsinh, that they will be back within half an hour and left in an auto rickshaw, said a senior crime branch official.
 
 After that, Togadia was not reachable and his cellphone was switched off, said a police official. “We have handed over the inquiry to probe under which circumstances Togadia was allowed to leave without security cover.

 Meanwhile, police officials said they have identified the bearded VHP man as Dhirubhai who works with VHP office and had left with Togadia in an auto and will summon him to record his statement and track where Togadia had gone after leaving the VHP office.
