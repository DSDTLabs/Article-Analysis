MUMBAI:   board has directed all its schools to reserve one period daily from 2018-19 academic year for physical education for Std IX-XII. It wants to 'mainstream' the subject for holistic development of students. 

  (HPE) will be a mandatory for all schools and CBSE will release curriculum details. 
 
 CBSE's chairperson Anita Karwal wrote to schools: "CBSE has decided to mainstream HPE with the aim of holistic development of the child, leading to a well-balanced individual in all walks of life".
 
 Principals of CBSE schools in the city aren't happy with the last-minute change. "Students will enjoy more time for sports, but not if the curriculum has theory about physical education," said the principal of a school in the western suburbs. "In Mumbai, we might not have enough space to have a PE class for everyone everyday.." Principals also worry this will eat into academic time. "Especially for classes X and XII which are board-exam years, it will disrupt their regular lessons," said Kalpana Diwedi, principal, St Joseph High School, Panvel.
