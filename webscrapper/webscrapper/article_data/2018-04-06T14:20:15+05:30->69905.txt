VADODARA: The District Consumer Redressal Forum had last month asked directors of   Limited, one of the group companies of   (DPIL), to return the token amount of Rs 1.5 lakh along with 8% interest and Rs 6,000 towards mental harassment and legal cost to one of their customers. 

 The order was passed as   Spaces had failed to hand over possession of a flat in its ‘Eklavya’ project, at Karodiya in Gorwa, within the promised period to  , a resident of Gorwa, who had paid a token amount of Rs 1.5 lakh for the property. However, after the judgement, several other persons have come forward with similar complaints.
 
 “After the judgement was delivered on March 19, two to three victims have been approaching me daily to file similar cases of cheating against Northway Spaces in the consumer forum. I asked them to track down all those who have been cheated so that we can file a joint complaint in the forum,” said P V Moorjani, a city-based consumer lawyer, who fought Solanki’s case.
 
 Northway Spaces has Mona Amit Bhatnagar, Richa Sumit Bhatnagar and   as its directors. Moorjani said that all the victims had given token amount ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh for buying 1BHK flat in the scheme, which was on the lines of MIG homes of the state government but with modern facilities. “But none of them have been given possession. When the project was initiated, 43 towers of 13 floors each were promised, but so far only six floors of four towers have been constructed,” Moorjani claimed.
 
 He said that during the hearing of Solanki’s case, the court commissioner drew an inquest of the project during which it came to light that plaster work of the building was pending. The sanitation work was also incomplete as were electrification, elevator in the building, water and drainage connection and doors and windows.
