MYSURU : A week after impounding thousands of sub-standard   by Mysuru city police, confusion prevails over its identification whether headgears being used by over 6.5 lakh two-wheeler users are of ISI/BIS standard or not.

 Police personnel have contacted the department of legal metrology in Mysuru seeking its assistance in identifying   and awaiting reply from them.
 
 Usually, police take assistance of legal metrology authorities to check auto fare meters whether they have been tampered or not.
 
 The confusion here is who has to certify whether the helmets conform to the BIS standards or if the police are competent enough to differentiate them or has the power to impound them.
  
  
 R Girijesh, a retired police officer, claimed that police as a law enforcing authority have powers to impound ‘doubtful’ goods for verification and secondly, as per the provisions of Karnataka Police Act, a police officer can use his best endeavours to avert any accident or danger to public.
 
 Police had seized 15,501 helmets during a special drive – Operation Safe Ride – following which there was an uproar questioning police action. However, they didn’t levy fine on the riders during the five-hour drive, but educated them on buying standard helmets.
 
 Though provisions of Motor Vehicles Act 1988 are clear that every person driving a motor cycle of any class or description shall wear protective headgears conforming to standards of BIS, but lack of knowledge on the issue may have probably created the confusion.
 
 Police have put off the drive twice and have extended the deadline till January 31.
 
 Police commissioner A Subramanyeshwara Rao told TOI: “We have sought assistance of legal metrology to assist us on identifying non-ISI standard helmets. Meanwhile, we will shortly issue a release with regard to ISI-marked helmets.”
 
 Number of vehicles is more than 8.6 lakh, of which 79.96% are two-wheelers in Mysuru.
