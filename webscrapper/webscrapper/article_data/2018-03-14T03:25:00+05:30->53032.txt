Mapusa: Pernem police arrested four persons on charges of rioting and abduction after the Pernem   parade on Tuesday.

 Police sources said that while the Pernem ‘romtamell’ group was in the procession, the Bardez group said that they were unhappy that the event was being judged. They said they were not performing for competition sake, but for public viewing. The Bardez group said they wanted to perform one rhythm of the ‘romtamell’ which requires 12 minutes, but they were not allowed to perform. This sparked tension at the Shigmo parade. Police said that later in the evening, some members from the Pernem group went to have a meal at a restaurant at Dhargalim. Two of their accomplices were on their way from Pernem to join them at Dhargalim.
 
 Sources said that the complainant, Manoj Parab, stated that the Bardez ‘romtamell’ group chased them in a car and on a two-wheeler and dashed them. Parab was taken hostage, while his friend fled and alerted the other group members. The Pernem group managed to rescue their friends and caught hold of one of the accused, while the other fled. Police arrested Hashish Chari, Jadish Chari, Mayur Usapkar and Santosh Gawade, who were released on bail.
