Pune: Over 40% of the city’s population living in slums can hope for larger homes. 

 The Pune Municipal Corporation is currently considering a proposal to offer bigger homes to slum dwellers. The increased size of houses will essentially help provide better sanitation facilities.
 
 “The height of the room will be increased, which will automatically increase the size. More space will be available for users,” said corporator Bapu Karne, who has submitted the proposal.
 
 Currently, the maximum height of a dwelling is set at 14ft. The proposal seeks to increase it to 30ft so that a two-storey building can be constructed and sanitation facilities, such as a toilet, can be built within the premises.
 
 “Right now, most slum dwellers have constructed toilets on the streets, which has led to many issues such as the roads becoming narrow. If the permission to build taller dwellings is given, these roads can be made free for commuting,” said Karne.
 
 The city has around 564 slums, housing over 15 lakh citizens. “The proposal was discussed in the city improvement committee. A review has been sought and the report is expected to be tabled before the committee next week,” said a senior PMC official.
 
 According data available with PMC, of 302 flats under the slum rehabilitation authority scheme, 51 were vacant due to lack of demand.
