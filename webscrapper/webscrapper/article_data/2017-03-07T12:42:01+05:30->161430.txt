 is in headlines nowadays for a hell lot of reasons. Whether it's her latest movie Rangoon, her controversial statements on Koffee With Karan, her relationship status or her fashion sense... the actress just doesn't stay out of news. And here's another reason- a good one. 
Kangana has graced  's March cover, for the first time ever, and looked gorgeous. She can be seen a pink lacy slip dress, teamed up with a vibrant jacket, and statement earrings. Her subtle make-up plays a key role in making her look elegant and graceful. Plus, her soft curls further added oomph to her look. Isn't she painting a picture straight out of a modern fairy tale?!
