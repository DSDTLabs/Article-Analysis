CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu finance minister D   on Thursday presented a tax-free budget for 2017-18, despite a falling tax revenue and increasing expenditure due to higher subsidies. 

 
 
 The state’s fiscal deficit for 2016-17 overshot the 3% GSDP, the percentage permitted under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.
 
 “The tax revenue growth has been lower than that estimated in the revised budget for 2016-17 due to uncertainty in domestic economy. There is significant drop in state’s own tax revenue growth rate, especially in the receipts from stamp and registration charges. The breach in FRBM Act is due to takeover of Tangedco debt of Rs 14,000 crore under the Uday scheme,” said the finance minister.
 
 The government, however, is hopeful of bringing down the fiscal deficit within 3% in the 2017-18. “As the takeover of the Tangedco debt is only temporary, the fiscal deficit will be lowered and will be below 3%,” said Jayakumar.
 
 Despite not reaching the revenue target, the government has set a tax revenue target of Rs 99,590.14 crore which is around 9.8% increase. Compared to this in the current year, the government’s revenue has fallen short by 3% than the budget estimates of 2016-17.
 
 “The low economic growth, demonetisation and the ban on sale of property in unapproved layouts have dented the receipts from stamp duty and registration charges severely. Considering these factors, receipts from stamp duty and registration charges are expected to be Rs 8,220 crore during 2017-18, as against Rs 7,985 crore,” said the finance minister.
 
 Despite the poor financial situation, the government has refused to slacken its welfare measures and subsidies. The total subsidy and grants is expected to be Rs 72,615.76 crore against Rs 68,211.05 crore estimated last year.
 
 School education has received the maximum allocation as in each with Rs 26,932 crore for 2017-18. The next higher allocation is for the electricity sector. The government has allocated Rs 16,998 crore and out of this Rs 8,538 crore will as subsidy to Tangedco for providing 100 units free power to domestic consumers and free power to farmers.
 
 To prevent fragmentation of land holdings, the government has proposed a new scheme called farmer producer groups which will be federated into farmer producer organisations to promote collective farming for credit mobilisation, better adoption of technology and to facilitate effective forward and backward linkages. “In 2017-18, as a pilot project, 2,000 such farmer producer groups will be promoted, each comprising not less than 100 farmers,” said Jayakumar.
