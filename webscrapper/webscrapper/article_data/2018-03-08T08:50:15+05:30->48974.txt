HYDERABAD:   of the Hyderabad high court on Thursday initiated proceedings under the contempt of courts Act against Telangana special chief secretary (housing)   and Ramky Infra authorised signatory M  .

  The high court directed the two to appear before the court on April 6. On that day, the duo will have to explain the reasons for their failure to register flats in  , Gachibowli, in favour of buyers who paid the total cost of the flat.
 
 Justice SV Bhatt was dealing with two separate contempt cases filed by A Gayatri Sekhar and B  , who were aggrieved with the scant regard shown by Chitra Ramachandran and  towards the court order issued on March 9, 2017. This court order had directed Chitra Ramachandran and M Sridhar Reddy to complete the registrations in favour of buyers who had paid the total value of flats at Ramky Towers in Gachibowli.
 
 
 Petitioners’ advocates Arcot Chandrasekhar and S Sridhar informed the high court that the tussle between Ramky Towers and the state housing board is adversely affecting the buyers. “We paid the total money and are still waiting for the registrations to be done,” the petitioners’ advocates told the High Court As many as 150 customers are caught in this conflict. 
 
 Last year, the State and Ramky Towers had assured the court that registration of flats will be done, however, it has not been done till now. Believing their assurances, the court had directed them to complete the registration process within 4 weeks. But it has not been done yet, the advocates said. The judge noted that a prima facie contempt case has been made out and issued contempt notices to Chitra Ramachandran and M Sridhar Reddy.
