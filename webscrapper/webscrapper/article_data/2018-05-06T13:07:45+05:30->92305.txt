KOCHI: Students from Tamil Nadu are grateful for the assistance provided by the state government here, said S  , the advocate who had filled a petition at the Madras high court, requesting that NEET centres be relocated to Tamil Nadu. 

 Mylavan had driven to Kochi from   with his family as his daughter is writing NEET on Sunday at Ernakulam. Soon after he arrived, he dropped his family at a hotel and rushed to   railway station, where he met anxious students and their families.
 
 "It was an excruciating journey for students and their families as they came in the packed general compartment of various trains. Furthermore, they were worried about how they would communicate once they arrived here because most of them are not fluent in English, Malayalam or Hindi. They only know Tamil," he said.
 
 Mylavan said the state government's initiative was very helpful as help desks were in place with people who knew Tamil to assist visiting families with information on transportation and accommodation. "It was hectic because we were also expecting the centres to be shifted. It was not bad in my daughter's case because we had a car. I filed the petition in court as many others cannot afford such a trip," he said. He said for many students , it was difficult to communicate once they were outside Tamil Nadu. "When I spoke to the students, they were relieved by the assistance the state government had provided," he added.
