HYDERABAD:   was away at   when a bomb ripped through   He lost no one; neither was anybody he knew injured in the blast. Yet, a year after that Imran’s life changed completely — only, for the worse.

 “I was asleep at my house in   when the police turned up at my doorstep one night. It was about 1am. They did not know my name then, yet they picked me up and dragged me to the police station on charges of curating the blast,” recalled Imran, who was all of 22 years then.
 
 What followed was 18 months and 24 days of merciless torture behind iron bars. “They did everything to break me down and make me falsely confess to masterminding the blast. They beat me, gave me electric shocks and even deprived me of sleep. I kept crying and begging with them to show mercy but failed,” Imran said, his voice quivering each time he narrated a detail from his scarred past. He continued: “At one point when the police picked up my two siblings, I gave in and decided to accept all charges. Thankfully, the court sided with me and pronounced me notguilty.”
 
 But the legal relief failed to bring Imran’s life back on track, immediately. It took him another year. “Starting life all over again was not easy, as people treated me and my family very differently. I had to change jobs at least four times,” he added.
 
 Though his life is now settled, after the verdict, Imran fears that people might start pointing fingers at him again. “Also, people lost their loved ones need answers. I have lost all faith in the law,” he said.
