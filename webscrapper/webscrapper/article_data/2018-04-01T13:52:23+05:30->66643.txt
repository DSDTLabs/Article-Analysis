MADURAI: In a daring incident, unidentified men barged into a house on Friday night, allegedly murdered a 32-year-old woman and escaped with gold jewellery weighing 16 sovereigns. The incident, which took place in Sivaganga district came to light when the victimâ€™s nine-year-old son, who was left unharmed by the gang, alerted the neighbours.

 Police identified the victim as A Shanthi from   village near Karaikudi. Police said that Shanthi was staying in the house along with her son A Santhosh and her relative, Priya. Her husband   is working abroad.
 
 A gang with the motive of looting the house, knocked on the doors on Friday night. Shanthi, who was sleeping, came to open the door. The gang pushed her inside and locked themselves inside the house. As she tried to raise an alarm, the gang administered chloroform and made her unconscious.
 
 Police said that when Priya came out of the room hearing the commotion, she also was calmed down by giving the chloroform. The gang then threatened the little boy and made him to lie down. They searched for valuables in the nook and cranny of the house. But they could not find anything. They then escaped with the gold jewellery worn by the woman. Soon after the gang left, Santhosh sprinkled water on the two and tried to revive them.
 
 While Priya responded, his mother could not be revived. He alerted the neighbours, who in turn alerted the Chettinad police station. A team rushed there and shifted Shanthi to a hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.
 
 Based on a complaint a case was registered and a search was on for the suspects.
