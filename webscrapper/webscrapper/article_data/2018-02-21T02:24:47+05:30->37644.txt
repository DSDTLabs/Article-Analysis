GREATER NOIDA: The   Industrial Development Authority ( ) is set to carry out a drive against   hoardings, kiosks and   in the city and has threatened strict action against offenders.

 On the first day of the drive on Tuesday, the GNIDA removed and demolished over 20 large unipoles that were illegally hosting advertisements in the city.
 
 GNIDA officials said they would keep watch on each and every crossing, roundabout, roadside and other public places for unauthorised hoardings. “The drive will be conducted in the entire city against illegal hoardings, kiosks and posters so that the city remains ‘free of eyesores’,” said KM Chaudhary, a senior manager looking after the encroachment cell in Greater Noida.
 
 “No one will be spared. For starters, we scanned one of the busiest crossings in the city,   rotary and carried out the exercise amid heavy police presence,” he said. “Once such hoardings and posters are removed, a vigilance will be done against the offenders and deterrent action taken. The aim is to clear the city of illegal advertisements,” he added.
 
 The official further said GNIDA was yet to finalise the advertising policy and so imposing fines and lodging of FIRs against offenders was yet to be initiated. “This policy is under consideration but action is on the cards, soon,” he said.
