CHANDIGARH: A 65-year-old woman was burnt alive when the roof of the hut she had taken shelter in to escape field blaze caved-in. The incident happened at Barhad village near   town in   district on Sunday night. 

 According to villagers, the wheat straw kept in fields caught fire due to a spark in electricity cables passing overhead and winds fanned the flames further. In order to reach a safe place,   alias Karishmi Devi ran into a thatched-roof hut build in the field but it caught fire. Chhatar was burnt alive after the hut’s roof caved-in. Even the pouring rain failed to douse the flames.
 
 Her son   alleged that the fire brigade did not reach in time. Gharaunda station house officer (SHO) inspector   admitted that the arrival of fire tenders was delayed. “We took 40 minutes to reach the spot as the village and fields are in deep interiors. Despite our wireless messages, fire tenders did not come,” he SHO said.
 
 Since the hut had heaps of cow dung cakes and stubble lying inside, it went up in flames like a tinderbox and there was no escape for the old woman. Her body was removed in the morning and handed over to kin after the autopsy, SHO Kumar said.
