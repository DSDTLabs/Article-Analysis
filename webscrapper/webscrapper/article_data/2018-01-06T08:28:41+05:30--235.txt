COIMBATORE: A supporter of   leader   has approached a Coimbatore court seeking action against actor   for defaming Dhinakaran and   voters.

 The petitioner,   from Ganapathy area in the city, filed a defamation suit at the judicial magistrate court II on Friday. The petition would be taken up for consideration on January 12.
 
 The petitioner, referring to an article written by   Haasan in a Tamil weekly, sought action against the actor under IPC sections 500 (defamation) and 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory). 
 
 In the article that dwelt on the recently concluded R K Nagar bypoll, Kamal had hit hard on Dhinakaran, who won the elections, alleging that the votes were obtained by bribing the voters. He also slammed the voters of R K Nagar, stating that receiving money for votes was akin to begging from a thief.
 
 Dhinakaran had hit back at Kamal for the allegations stating that such statements only showed the ignorance of the actor. 
 
 The petitioner, however, said that he had approached the court on his individual capacity and Dhinakaran was not aware of the petition. “The number of votes polled by Dhinakaran shows the respect and love he commands among R K Nagar voters. Kamal cannot defame and denigrate such a leader and the voters,’’ Ilangovan said.
