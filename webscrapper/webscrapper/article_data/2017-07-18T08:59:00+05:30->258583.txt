Panaji: Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral on Monday said he has decided to file a   of privilege against Facebook on Tuesday for allowing activist Kashinath Shetye to upload a starred legislative   question (LAQ) document before it could come up for discussion in the House.

  The assembly’s monsoon session is set to commence on Tuesday.
 
 Cabral has already moved a breach of privilege against Shetye before speaker Pramod Sawant.
 
 “My question is not uploaded on the assembly website, I have not received any reply. But it appears on Facebook,” said Cabral.
 
  “I’ve moved the breach of privilege against Shetye for uploading the question on social media before it was presented in the House, and I will move breach of privilege   against Facebook on Tuesday,” he added, further saying that he will follow up on the matter.
 
 The MLA had sought an answer on “Whether the government is aware that Kashinath Shetye working as junior engineer in the Goa electricity department is indulging in gross violation of central civil service (CCS) conduct rules by filing cases in high courts, Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal and various other courts and forums and working as a full time activist thereby not behaving like a government servant?”
 
  Curchorem MLA also questioned how, Shetye — a power department employee on government salary — finds time to file RTI applications.
 
  “If he wants to do activism, he should leave his job and do it. I put the LAQ to find out the details of his duties and what he has been doing in the department for last few years,” the legislator said.
 
 Crime branch, on Friday night, registered an FIR against Shetye for allegedly stealing a starred LAQ document and uploading it on social media before it came up for discussion in the assembly. On July 12, Shetye had uploaded the LAQ asked by Cabral on his Facebook page.
