  "The dog bit her ears, lips and face. There are at least 10 bite marks on the face while the skin on the lips, ears and eyes have been torn off," he explained. Seven-year-old Arpita who was in the house saw the dog attacking the baby and alerted everyone. 
 
  
 
 
  "We first brought the baby to Shiralakoppa Government Hospital where there were no doctors or an ambulance. As the condition of the baby was serious, we hired a private cab and reached McGann hospital, Shivamogga, where doctors treated the girl. Later we shifted her to a private hospital," explained Kalal.
