Surat: The Surat Diamond Association (SDA) has urged the diamond workers visiting their hometowns in Saurashtra and north Gujarat to take maximum benefit of the buses operated by the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) with state government reducing one-way tariff during the festive season. 

 The association had asked government to reduce the one-way tariff from Surat to various destinations in Saurashtra and north Gujarat to facilitate the diamond workers and their families. The demand was accepted and a letter to this effect was sent by GSRTC to SDA with the revised one-way tariff. 
 
 Sources said that one-way tariff was earlier charged for extra buses run by GSRTC at 1.65% of the actual rate. However, the same has been reduced to 1.25%. However, the diamond workers travelling to their native places will get benefit of Rs 100 on the one-way ticket. 
 
 SDA members said GSRTC is collecting return fare from those travelling from Surat to Saurashtra during Diwali vacation. The GSRTC has been doing this to recover the cost of diesel spent on the travel from Surat to Saurashtra region. Because, almost 90% of the buses have to return without passengers. 
 
 SDA president Babu Gujarati said, “The diamond polishers are literally looted by private luxury operators who charge as high as Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 for one-way journey from Surat to various destinations in Saurashtra. In order to facilitate the diamond polishers, GSRTC has accepted our demand and reduced the one-way fare for extra buses being operated during Diwali festival.”
