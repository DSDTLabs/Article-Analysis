The city’s art connoisseurs were in for a treat early this week, when US-based Sri Lankan artist   held a   exhibition of her work. The proceeds of the show were in aid of underprivileged children suffering from cleft lip and palate, and art lovers wasted no time in picking up the paintings. The show was curated by   and supported by Deutsche Cleft’s Regional Director, South Asia, Dushyant Prasad, and Lalit Sanghvi.
