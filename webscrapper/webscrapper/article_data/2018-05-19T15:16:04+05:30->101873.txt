Summers are golden, carefree days with vacations stretching away into the horizon. But as every parent knows, the excitement of the beginning of the summer vacations soon fizzles away leaving kids with too much time on their hands, a lot of pent up energy and nothing to do with either of them. ‘Boredom’ looms large and is something that every parent dreads.

  
 This is something that the experts at Leon’s World Centre for Holistic Learning and Development, at Rustomjee Urbania, Thane are all too aware of and so they designed a series of activities through the month of May to ensure that the summer sun brings with it loads of  . The activities have been planned to encourage all round development in the children and cover all aspects from sports to music, art to drama and also a healthy dose of intelligent and thought provoking workshops to keep their grey cells ticking.
 
  
 Children got to choose to do a few or all the activities that are lined up for the summer, including sports like table tennis, football and skating. Drama and stories are a necessary part of growing up and something that all kids look forward to. To encourage the questioning and inquisitive nature of children and get them involved with science, there were several workshops including Science Camp, Lego Robotics and Mathemazing Fun. Sundays had more activities like pottery, theatre, dance and music.
 
  
 All the activities will be conducted by organisers who are experts in their field and have several years of experience in honing the skills and talents of young children in an easy and entertaining manner that makes learning fun! The parents have not been forgotten either and there are workshops planned for them as well including Salsa and a parenting workshop that guides parents on how to approach sensitive topics with children.
