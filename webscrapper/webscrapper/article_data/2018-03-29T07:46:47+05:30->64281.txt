FEROZEPUR: Two youth organisations in   are up in arms against the district administration here for not taking care of a building in the town that was used as a hideout by freedom fighter  , and the main office of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).

 The protesters, belonging to   (PSU) and Naujawan Bharat Sabha (NBS), staged a protest on Wednesday to demand that the building be converted into a museum and library, as had been promised by tourism and cultural affairs minister Navjot Singh Sidhu a few months ago, they said. 
 
 The protesters observed a sit-in outside the office of the Ferozepur deputy commissioner (DC) too. They claimed that the building continued to suffer neglect, even though it had been notified as a protected monument two years ago.
 
 PSU zonal leader Gurvinder Singh and NBS’s   said many important plans were discussed between the revolutionaries at the hideout. “This is the place where our martyrs dreamt of an independent India. There is a need to keep their ideology alive and preserve this place as a motivating force for the coming generation.”
 
 After prolonged struggle by Ferozeopur residents, followed by a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the   and Haryana high court by advocate H C  , the Punjab department of tourism and cultural affairs had declared the building a protected monument on December 17, 2015, under the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1964. However, no steps had been initiated to take over the building for preservation or allocate funds for the purpose.
 
 A few months ago, Sidhu, during a visit to Ferozepur, had promised to provide Rs 15 lakh for renovation of the building. The funds are still awaited. PSU and NBS activists said their fight would continue until the hideout was given a practical shape of converting it into a museum and a library.
