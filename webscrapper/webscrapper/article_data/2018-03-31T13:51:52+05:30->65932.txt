One of the most celebrated filmmakers in the world,  , is on a four-day tour to India as a part of ‘Reframing The Future of Film’, an initiative that supports the cause of film preservation and restoration. Nolan, along with his wife   and children Magnus, Flora, Rory and Oliver, arrived in Mumbai on Friday. Interestingly, the British filmmaker met our very own ‘Ulaganayagan’   at a dinner party last night.

 Sharing the picture on Twitter, Kamal wrote, “Met Mr Christopher Nolan. Apologized for seeing 'Dunkirk' in the digital format and in return am sending 'Hey Ram' in digital format for him to see. Was surprised to know he had seen 'Paapanaasam'.” 
 
 Needless to say, the picture has gone viral on social media, with some hailing Haasan as the ‘Indian Nolan’. What’s amusing about the meeting is the fact that Nolan had watched Haasan’s ‘Papanasam’, a remake of the Malayalam blockbuster ‘Drishyam’.
 
 Haasan was also clicked with noted cinematographers   and Ravi K Chandran at the dinner party. It must be noted that Kamal Haasan and   were the two filmmakers who launched the 'Film Preservation and Restoration' workshop in Chennai, which was organised by Film Heritage Foundation.
 
  On the work front, Kamal Haasan awaits the release of his much-awaited ‘Vishwaroopam 2’. The National Award-winning actor will also be teaming up with Shankar for ‘Indian 2’ later this year.
