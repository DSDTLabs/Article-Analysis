CHANDIGARH: An NRI enjoyed his drink so much with a friend at a tavern in Sector 24 that he forgot his bag containing 26,000   (Rs 16 lakh approximately) at the watering hole, which luckily for him the owner found but unluckily, he would not be able to get it back for a while at least.

 The tavern owner handed over the bag, which also had two mobile phones and a passport, to the police. Cops contacted  , the owner of the bag, and asked him to get it released through court. Police also informed   (IT) department about the cash.
 
 Naresh Kumar, who works in the tavern, noticed the bag under the seat of a table on the night of February 1. By the time he could call the NRI and his friend, the two left. He handed over the bag to the owner, who said they tried to switch on the two mobile phones but they were out of battery. When they noticed the cash, he informed the police.
 
 Dalbir Singh, officiating station house officer, Sector 11, said cops from Sector 24 police post reached the tavern and collected the bag. When police officials contacted Rathore, who hails from Saharanpur in  , he told them that he worked in a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. Police said he had come to India last month to attend the wedding of his younger brother. “I had come to the city to exchange the US dollars with Indian currency. The money is my hard-earned savings,” Rathore said.
 
 The SHO, however, said, “If anybody is carrying such a huge foreign currency, he has to declare it to the customs department at the airport following which it issues a declaration form. The NRI was not able to produce the declaration form,” the SHO said. However, Rathore claimed that he has the declaration form and would submit it to the police in a day or two. The SHO said when the NRI would declare the source of the money and if the authority would be satisfied with his reply, his money would be released.
