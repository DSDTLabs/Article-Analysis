GURGAON: The state government has set the ball rolling for   elections that have been due for over six months. An official said the polls could be held on the first week of March.

 The urban local bodies department on Friday issued a notification for delimitation of wards, the exercise that has been holding up the polls, and invited objections and suggestions from residents by January 23. The final notification is expected by the first week of February after which the voter list and election schedule can be announced.
 
 The notification comes days after municipal polls were held in Faridabad, also after a long delay. The ad hoc committee formed by the   government last year has recommended that number of wards should remain at 35 after delimitation. Six wards will be reserved for SC/ST candidates, two of which will be for women. Of the remaining 29 wards, two will be reserved for OBCs while 10 others in the general category will only have women contestants. In all, 12 wards will be reserved for women to meet the 33% reservation target. As reported by TOI earlier, this time around, the mayor’s post has been reserved for a woman candidate from the SC/ST category.
 
 While it is yet to be decided which six wards will be reserved for SC/STs, they are likely to be wards 1 (Palam Vihar), 7 (Rajeev Nagar, Sanjay Gram), 11 (Rajendra Park), 17 (Nayi Basti, Prem Nagar), 21 (Feroze Gandhi colony, Ravi Nagar, Veer Nagar, Shakti Nagar and  ). The sixth could be either ward 8 ( ) or 25 (Badshapur).
 
 “We have tried to maintain a balance while drawing the boundaries of each ward. The idea was that each ward should have both rural and urban areas. Last time around, some wards were totally rural while some had only urban areas,” said GL Sharma, a member of the committee.
