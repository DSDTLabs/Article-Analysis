NEW DELHI: Indian   ( ) has recalled its “heaviest communication satellite” Gsat-11 from Arianespace’s spaceport in   to carry out more tests on the satellite and has rescheduled its launch date. The launch of 5.7 tonne satellite was initially planned on May 25.

 
 Talking to TOI, Isro chairman   said, “Gsat-11 has been recalled from French Guiana not because of any glitch. We want to carry out more tests on the satellite to ensure its launch is glitchfree.”
 
 He said, “Our team in French Guiana is working on modalities to bring the satellite back to India. After all the tests and checks on Gsat-11 in India, we will decide on its next launch date.”
 
 The high-throughput satellite, which carries 40 transponders in Ku-band and Ka-band frequencies, is capable of “providing high bandwidth connectivity” with up to 14 gigabit per second (GBPS) data transfer speed. The heavy-duty satellite is so massive that each solar panel is over four metres long, equivalent to the size of a room.
 
 Isro is taking all precautions for satellite launches especially after the agency lost communication link with its recently launched satellite Gsat-6A.
