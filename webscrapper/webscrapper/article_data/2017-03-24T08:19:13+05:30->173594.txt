"Till all the states, the GST Coun cil agree, we won't start imposing tax on these," he said. On demonetisation, Jaitley said it was required in the larger interests of the economy to curb "cash being a facilitator of crime" in "a largely tax non-compliant nation", and the move had been welcomed by people at large as was evident from the recent state assembly results.
