After the success of   (MM),   says he has been getting plenty of offers. But there is an interesting story behind how he came on board that film. “I must thank  , Karthikeyan and of course, director   for that film. The movie earned me a good name because of Rathna Kumar. But there’s an interesting story... I was in love with him for almost a year and literally stalked him,” he says with a laugh.

 On a serious note, he adds, “I was behind him to make that film. He wanted to do a different script, but I really liked the story of MM. I am glad it was received well. It gave me a good break and recognition. People who thought I was good only in multistarrers accepted me as a solo lead. But that doesn’t mean I won’t act in multistarrers. Lately, I have been getting only films which have me as the solo lead. It doesn’t matter if it’s a solo lead project or a multistarrer film — as long as I get a solid role, I am happy.” 
 
 Vaibhav is presently working on   with Deekay, in which he plays a ‘funny’ goon. He says, “This is a thriller comedy... there is an equal dose of both in the film. I play a con artiste, who works under a don... more like comical goon, I must say. I’m thankful to   for casting me in this one.”
 
 The actor is also part of two other projects, which will take off by the end of this month. Ask him if he’s part of Karthik Subbaraj’s film with   and he smiles, “No, I think he has finalised all the actors for Thalaivar’s film. But I will definitely ask him to give me a tiny role... it is okay even if I come for 10 seconds.”
