HYDERABAD: Increasing demand for short holidays to places in Thailand, Singapore and Dubai are the new travel trends ahead of Sankaranti. 

 With holiday packages starting at a cheap Rs 10,000 per person for three days, it is obvious that families in the metropolitan area are opting for   over domestic ones, said an employee of Makemytrip, Hyderabad.
 
 Holiday destinations in Turkey, Vietnam, Macaw and Greece are gaining popularity, said Wahaj Amjad of Sky Routes travels. With the provision of Service apartments, more families are showing interest in these tours, he added. Over the past one month, 250 bookings were done, Wahaj said.
 
 While international destinations were favourites for air travellers,   and Jubilee Bus Station saw a huge rush of people jostling for a seat to go to their native places. Nearly 900 buses have left from   bus stand alone, said Raghavendra Reddy, a senior official at MGBS. “We are expecting more passengers in the next few days,” he said.
 
 With the sudden rush of buses and cars from Thursday morning, there was a 2-km traffic jam near the Patangi toll plaza of Choutuppal mandal on the city’s outskirts. Though all the five lanes were opened to avoid congestion, traffic slowed down as commuters were seen using swiping machines at the toll gates.
 
 The rush was the most at railways stations, especially the Secunderabad station. About 130 special trains were being run by the railways from Secunderabad and Hyderabad during this period and seven special trains were being run exclusively to meet passenger rush during the festival.
 
 Passengers hailed the online ticket booking system that spared them from standing in long queues. “I booked my ticket to Mumbai two weeks ago. It was in waiting list and just got confirmed. Even though the ticket prices are high compared to last year, I am thankful to IRCTC website. I didn’t have to stand in queue,” said Reshma, a software employee heading to the railway station from Lakdikapul.
