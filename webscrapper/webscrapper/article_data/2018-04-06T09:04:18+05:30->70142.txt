JAIPUR: Legendary Australian legspinner   feels many people who have a grudge against Australia are using the ball-tampering fiasco as an opportunity to hit back at Australia. 

 
 
 
 “Some of them are using this to slam their boot into Australia,” the   mentor, who joined the team here on Thursday, said on the sidelines of their jersey launching event. Royals, returning to the   after two years, will play their first match in Hyderabad on Monday “There is unnecessary hysteria over the issue (ball tampering),”
 
 
 
 Warne said: “Of course it has been an embarrassment and I am not defending it in any way, but some people are going overboard.” 
 
 He suggested that things would be better if it toned down a little. The Australian added that this was an opportunity for other countries to do some fact findings as well. 
 
 “Australia need to think about how to carry on from here, but other countries should also start looking into their backyards,” he said. There could be some cleaning up to do, he is of the opinion.
 
 Following undeniable video footage and subsequent confessions,  , David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were suspended by Cricket Australia for nine to 12 months. Coach Darren Lehman resigned and Warne expects more heads to roll.
 
 Although Smith’s absence could adversely affect the Royals, Warne feels this is the best team they have ever had. “Our guys did a very good job in getting these combinations,” he said.
 
 In fact, he even went a step ahead in saying that Ajinkya Rahane was the best captain in the game. “I have seen how he functions and I must say we are very lucky to have him. My job would be just to help him and the others out. I am looking forward to being with the boys.”
