NEW DELHI: The   has upheld the   granted to a man who stabbed his wife 21 times with a  , six years ago.

 A bench of justices Sunil Gaur and Prathiba M Singh dismissed the appeal of   saying it was without any substance and upheld his conviction and sentence of life imprisonment by the trial court.
 
 “It is quite evident that Dass had brutally assaulted his wife. So, in our opinion, in the instant case, it cannot be said that the offence committed by Dass is ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’. It is a case of brutal murder,” the bench observed, dismissing the plea of the man that his crime should be treated with lesser gravity and reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 
 A court-appointed amicus appearing for Dass submitted that evidence showed “Dass is a drunkard and in a fit of anger, he had assaulted his wife and so, the offence committed by appellant comes within the definition of Section 304, Part-I of IPC.”
 
 His lawyer further prayed for leniency, arguing that Dass had undergone a sentence of about six years and has no previous criminal record, while his conduct in the jail is satisfactory.
 
  Urging HC to consider the circumstances and the fact that he has to support his minor children, the amicus said his punishment should be reduced to the period already undergone by him.
 
 But HC noted that the assault on the woman’s head was “so brutal” that it resulted in fracture of underlying skull bone and can’t be treated as culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 
 According to the prosecution, Dass murdered his wife on the intervening night of October 31 and November 1, 2012 by stabbing her 21 times with a peeler knife and hitting with a brick. He committed the crime following a quarrel with his wife.
