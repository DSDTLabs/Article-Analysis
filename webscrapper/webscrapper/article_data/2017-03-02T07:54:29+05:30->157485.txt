AHMEDABAD: The legal fraternity at the city sessions court was surprised when a special   (POCSO) court pointed to the shastras to justify its decision to exonerate a man accused of raping a minor.

 Besides trying to explain the complex situation, where the rape victims married the accused, the court expressed its anguish at the “degeneration” in society.
 
 Probably drawing inspiration from German philosopher   on how objects of opposite natures actually complement each other, special judge   puts childhood (shaishav) and adulthood (pukht) as complementary in his order on the rape of a minor. This has been observed in two cases. The boys were booked on rape charges and under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) after elopement because the victims were minor girls in both cases. In one year’s time, the girls married the accused in both the cases. All the witnesses turned hostile at trial and the court did not find any evidence against the accused. This led to their acquittal.
 
 In the order, the judge quotes from a book ‘Atithi – Hari no Gothiyo’ using language reminiscent of the famous Gujarati work of fiction ‘Bhadrambhadra’. He cites ‘Alankaar Shastra’ to define Mother Nature as an innocent woman and advises restraint for men, to secure the purity of the fair sex, “If men’s behaviour improves, it would only secure the piousness of women.” 
 
 After a paragraph on how love can change the course of the world, the court further says, “In the art of sculpture (Shilp Shastra), man and woman shown together reflects the pleasure of conception. That is why we enjoy sculptures in a temple and the art of a painter.”
