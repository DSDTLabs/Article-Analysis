MUMBAI: The   on Friday asked the railways to set up   (EMRs) at all stations on central and western lines in a phased manner. 

 “The criteria to set up EMRs should not be the number of accidents that have occurred at a particular station,” said a division bench of   and  . “EMRs over a period of time should be set up at all stations on suburban railways.”
 
 The court was hearing a PIL by activist   on the issue of track deaths. In March 2015, the railways had undertaken before the HC that in addition to the EMR at Dadar, it would make available similar units on 23 other stations on Central, Western and Harbour line stations that had witnessed more than 100 accidents in a year. 
 
 Advocate Jamshed Mistry, amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the case, informed the HC that Central Railways had decided to set up additional EMRS at all stations that had witnessed between 50 and 100 accidents last year. The advocate said that Western Railways should also consider it at its stations that had seen over 50 accidents.
