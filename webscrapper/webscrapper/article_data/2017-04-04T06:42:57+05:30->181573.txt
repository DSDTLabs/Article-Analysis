BENGALURU: BBMP and education department officials appeared before   P   on Monday in relation to a complaint lodged by students of Netaji   Bose government high school,  . The kids had complained against construction of a temple on the campus. 

 The Lokayukta had summoned the executive engineer and assistant executive engineer of BBMP (Wilson Garden) and the block education officer of the South 3 division. He questioned the officials on how the temple construction was permitted inside the school premises.
 
 "I am convinced that the land belongs to the school and no temple can come up on its premises," said the Lokayukta. The officials have been asked to appear again on April 7. "Constructing a temple may be laudable, but the objective can be achieved by building it on land which doesn't belong to the school. The school must be allowed to retain the land for the benefit and enjoyment of students over the years to come," the Lokayukta said. 
 
  TOI had published a report on the temple construction in the school premises on March 24, 2017. The TOI query had resulted in the Lokayukta taking up a suo motu case and directing the BBMP engineers and education department officials concerned to stop the work immediately. 
 
  On March 31, the block education officer of south 3 division, under whose purview the school falls, had filed a complaint with Wilson Garden police to immediately halt the work and has sought protection from the encroachers.
