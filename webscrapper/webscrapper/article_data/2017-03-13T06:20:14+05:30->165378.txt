 Started by a city-based entrepreneur, Jai Eapen, Britecamp works as a market place for students who not only wish to showcase and sell their artwork but who are also willing to contribute to the development of society. "We have tied up with dozens of schools in Hyderabad where this platform is offered for free. Students can upload their artwork including paintings and handmade jewellery and put it up for sale. Friends, relatives or anyone for that matter can encourage students' and buy the product. Almost 50% of the revenue generated goes to an NGO," said Eapen. 
 
 The online platform has also started crowdfunding. It has already collected over Rs 3.37 lakh within a few days. 
 
 School managements have welcomed the platform as they believe it is 'by the students and for the students'. "Due to high penetration of technology and gadgets, students get distracted by social media easily. This platform makes them take up art. We introduced this in our school and so far we have got great a response from students," said  , principal of the   in Attapur.
