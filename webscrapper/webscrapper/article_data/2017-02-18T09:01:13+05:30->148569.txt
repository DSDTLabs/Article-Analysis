MARGAO: Unlike Panaji, the   in Margao will once again be held on the new route from Margao Old Market-Colva circle via Ravindra Bhavan, Fatorda, and culminate in front of Borkar superstores opposite the Nehru stadium, Fatorda, on February 26.

 Margao   (MMC) chief officer Yeshwant Tawde, who heads the Margao carnival organising committee, said he had already issued instructions to   officials to inspect the parade route (first utilised last year) as he had read reports of the route being dangerous to spectators who could fall into the low-lying nullah.
 
 Tawde quickly clarified that he had not received any complaint and added that this route was being inspected, with both the additional district magistrate Roncon Pereira as well as the   executive engineer assuring him that adequate precautions would be taken to ensure safety. 
 
 Tawde said the MMC had received Rs 10 lakh in two installments of Rs 5 lakh each from the government to organise the festivities.
 
 Tawde added, “As no politician can be invited to partake in the celebrations as a chief guest, we will approach the chief secretary, secretary of tourism department or the urban development department, state election commissioner, DGP, IGP or South Goa Collector with whoever consenting being invited as the chief guest for the floats parade. Today, all members were present for the meeting except the official from the PWD works division XXII.”
