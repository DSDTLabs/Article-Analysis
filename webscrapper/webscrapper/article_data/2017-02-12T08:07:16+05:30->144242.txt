HYDERABAD: A man was taken into custody by   police on Saturday for allegedly abducting and then extorting `10 lakh from a woman. The victim is the daughter of Rangam, who was the commissioner of police in erstwhile Hyderabad state.

 Police said that the incident happened in the last week of December, but the victim approached the police two days ago. The victim, who owns a business in Panjagutta, was being blackmailed by her manager from the last few months.
 
 â€œIt seems the victim sacrificed an animal as oblation and the manager was blackmailing her that he would tell everyone about the incident,'' deputy commissioner of police (West Zone) A   said. The manager also hired two persons who abducted the victim by saying they were Task Force sleuths from Vijayawada. They took her into a car and started demanding `50 lakh.They let her go only after she transferred the amount online.
