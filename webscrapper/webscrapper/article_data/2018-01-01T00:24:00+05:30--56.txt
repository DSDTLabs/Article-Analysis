Madurai: Residents joined by various organisations entered the Sellur tank in Madurai in another attempt to clean and restore the glory of one of the main tanks in Madurai city on Sunday, New Year's Eve and said that they proposed to carry out the work whenever they have time throughout next year.

 Sellur tank in Madurai is situated on the northern bank of river Vaigai and is one of the important tanks in the city which gets water from river Vaigai. But, this tank which has shrunk to about 38.4 hectares from its original 75 hectares is holding water only in one portion and the people want to make sure that at least this water is conserved and kept clean. It was cleaned a few months ago, but is again covered with juliflora plants and garbage.
 
 Members from organisations such as Neernilaigal Paathukaapu Iyakkam, Kalam organisation, Sattapanchayat Iyakkam, Paravai Aindhinai Iyakkam, Sellur Arignar Anna Narpani Mandram, Uthavum Uravugal and Meenambalpuram womens SHG, entered the water which had entered the tank after over a year.
 
 R Abubucker of Neernilaigal Paathukaapu Iyakkam said that there was an urgent need to ensure that the water that had entered the tank was stored properly and that it was cleaned of the water hyacinths. “When the tank runs dry, the ground water also goes down to more than 1,000 feet,” he said.
 
 The volunteers entered the water, which was a few feet deep and removed it and pulled it out with poles. He said that they were doing it with the minimal funds they had been able to collect and that they would be able to do a better job if the government helped them. “The youngsters who take bath here, complained of itching recently,” said Jansi, a resident.
