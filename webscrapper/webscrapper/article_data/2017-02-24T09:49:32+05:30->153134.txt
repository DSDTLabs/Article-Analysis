MUMBAI: A large chunk of BJP seats have come from the belt between Dahisar and Goregaon as well as Mulund-Ghatkopar and the south Mumbai stretch from TardeoNana Chowk to Walkeshwar-Malabar Hill, all areas with large Gujarati enclaves.

 These were pockets that saw a significant surge in voting. Despite talk of the impact of demonetisation on trade and industry, results indicate overwhelming support for BJP from Gujaratis, a predominantly mercantile community.
 
 In the north, between Dahisar and Goregaon, more than 50% of its candidates prevailed. Of the total 58 seats, it secured 32. Candidate from Borivli, Pravin Shah, won by 19,580 votes, a staggering number considering the average base of a ward is only about 40,000 voters. Media professional Dhimantt Bhatt said, “Gujaratis are upset with Sena. Also, Jain community was not happy with the Sena's stand on Paryushan.“ In a tactical move, BJP had strengthened its connect with the community by offering tickets to several Gujaratis.Of its 82 winning candidates, 26 are corporators of Gujarati origin.
 
 In Ghatkopar (E), the party won two and lost one narrowly. Cong ress heavyweight   had provided freebies like CCTVs to housing societies in what was largely an upper middle class borough. But he was defeated by debutant Parag Shah, a builder who disclosed assets worth Rs 690 crore.
 
 Chheda polled around 11,000 vo tes but lost by 2,800 votes. A BJP worker said, “We could not have won but for the loyalty of Gujarati workers towards BJP.“
 
 The party also swept all six seats in Mulund, thanks to the Gujarati-Kutchi community's support.Said  , son of veteran BJP MP   who won from ward 108 in Mulund, “The Gujaratis stayed with BJP though there are rival parties (like Sena) pitching for Gujarati and Jain candidates to split votes.“ Sena candidate against him was Mukesh Karia, a Gujarati Jain well known in the area for his cable TV business.
