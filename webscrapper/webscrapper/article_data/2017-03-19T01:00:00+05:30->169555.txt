CHHAPRA: J P University VC Prof Harikesh Singh on Friday invoked socialist leader Jayaprakash Narain and said it was high time that his proposal on the right to recall non-performing elected representatives was enforced.

 “An active nation cannot wait for five years for the fruits of election to benefit it. We should, therefore, legalise the right to recall our non-performing people in power, as proposed by JP,” the VC said after inaugurating a National Service Scheme camp at Rajendra College in Chhapra. 
 
 Singh also batted for bridging the gap in the society. “Socialism will automatically occur the day the gap between the ‘Manch’ (honorable) and the ‘Panch’(common man) ends,” he said.
 
 The VC appealed to the college students to attend classes regularly. “A devotee in a temple, mosque or gurdwara gets the divine blessing even in the absence of priests because of the positive vibes inside the shrine. Similarly, the vibes that this college named after Rajendra Prasad generates, will surely benefit you,” he said.
 
 The VC asked the teachers, especially those coming from far-off places, to be regular. He praised college principal R S Ray for maintaining cleanliness on the premises. In a gesture that won him acoolades, the VC also gave Rs 500 from his packet to a sweeper who was seen cleaning the campus even in the scorching sun when the VC arrived in the college.
