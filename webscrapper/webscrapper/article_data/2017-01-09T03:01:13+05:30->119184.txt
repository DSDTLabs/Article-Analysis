GURUGRAM: People working in   are staring at a bleak future, with more traffic jams, less parking space and scarcity of water, as HSIIDC and industry bodies failed to come up with a plan for infrastructure development, to offset the recently increased floor area ratio (FAR) in the industrial estate. 

 In its new estate management policy, introduced last year, the state government had increased FAR to 250 for IT companies and 175 for others. The industries were supposed to compensate for the increase by paying   or increased   charges, which could be used to create infrastructure to support the greater numbers of people expected to work in the area, once more floors were added under the new FAR. 
 
 The corporation, along with industry associations, was supposed to come up with a plan for the required infrastructure, and on the same basis, calculate the augmentation charges. But sources have revealed some industry members are not keen on loosening their purse strings for any infrastructure work. 
 
 “The estate is already suffering from traffic and parking woes. If more people come here, more cars will come along with them. We need to create additional parking space,” said a senior HSIIDC official. “Unless we decide the kind of infrastructure upgrade required in the estate, we cannot decide the augmentation charges,” the official added. 
 
  “The charges for increased FAR are somewhere around Rs 4,000 per sq yd, which is too much to bear,” said  , president Udyog Vihar Industrial Association.
