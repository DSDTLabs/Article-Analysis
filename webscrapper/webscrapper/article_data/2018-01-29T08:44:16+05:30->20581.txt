BHAGALPUR: To strengthen linkage between scientists and farming community and provide science-based information at famers’ doorsteps, the Bihar Agricultural University (BAU) initiated ‘Kisan Chaupal’, which is now likely to be adopted across the country for disseminating scientific information to farmers.

 The   (ICAR) and the   (NITI Aayog), have also sought detailed information about ‘Kisan Chaupal’ from the BAU so that it can be implemented at national level.m“The NITI Aayog and ICAR, after going through the success stories of ‘Kisan Chaupal’, have shown interest in the ‘chaupal’ and have advised the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) across the country to implement it in their respective areas,” said BAU director extension and registrar RK   here on Sunday.
 
 BAU started ‘Kisan Chaupal’ in April 2012 in collaboration with 20 ‘Krishi Vigyan Kendras’ (KVKs) and the colleges under it which includes   (Sabour, Bhagalpur), Mandan Bharti Agriculture College (Saharsa), Bhola Paswan Shashtri Agriculture College (Purnia), Dr   (Kishanganj),   (Patna), Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Dairy Technology (Patna), College of Horticulture (Nalanda),   (Dumraon, Buxar).
 
 Since April 2012, ‘Kisan Chaupal’ is being organized every Saturday with the theme “Bihar Krishi Vishwa Vidyalay Kisano Ke Dwar- Kisan Chaupal” (Bihar Agricultural University at the doorstep of farmers).
 
 Sohane said that the ‘Chaupal’, was introduced to motivate the farmers to adopt modern farming practices besides providing area specific information to the farmers at their doorsteps through videos on cropping practices and allied activities.“It aims to collect feedback from the farmers’ fields and communicate it to the researchers for formulating research priorities,” added Sohane saying, “Our efforts are to revive the tradition village Chaupal to help farmers solve their problems on their own.”
 
 Referring to the statistics, Sohane said over 2 lakh farmers were benefitted since the launch of ‘Kisan Chaupal’ in 24 districts across the state. “The state government too has included the concept of ‘Kisan Chaupal’ in its ‘agriculture roadmap’ and has decided to implement it at panchayat-level across the state,” added the BAU official.
