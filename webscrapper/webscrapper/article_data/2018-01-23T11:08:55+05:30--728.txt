CHENNAI: The employees of   (TNEB) are an aggrieved lot. Unlike their transport counterparts, whose wage hike is yet to be settled,   employees and the management have arrived at an agreement for an overall wage hike of 2.57% but the management is awaiting orders from the government to formally announce the hike. 

 The agreement is said to have been signed between the management and various unions in December last year but the government is not ready to allow the management to formally announce the hike as this will add fuel to fire when a retired judge is hearing both sides on the transport department issue. 
 
 Soon after banners and posters with pictures of   union leaders thanking TNEB chairman M Saikumar appeared outside the board headquarters, they have since been removed. 
 
 "Talks went on for nearly a year on various issues put forth by the unions including the percentage of the pay hike, the date from which new wages will come into effect, filling up of vacancies etc. After much deliberation, the unions and management came to an agreement on 2.57% and on other issues," said a senior TNEB official. 
 
 The government first asked the TNEB management to wait till the end of   byelection as the model code was in effect. 
 
 "We expected the government to give its approval by end of December but it was not to be. Pongal was the next date we thought we will be allowed to announce but by then transport strike crippled the state. Now, we are not sure of the date on which the announcement will be made as talks with   are on," said the official.
