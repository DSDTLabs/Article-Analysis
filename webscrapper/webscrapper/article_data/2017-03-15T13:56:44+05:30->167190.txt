NEW DELHI: Decision Review System is in the news. Everywhere. Be it the ongoing India v Australia or Sri Lanka v Bangladesh Test series. There are dozens of instances where the controversial review system has been a source of amusement. Teams are yet to come to terms with the proper usage of technology as far as DRS is concerned and it sometimes results in both ugly controversies or funny instances. 

 One such hilarious incident happened during the first Sri Lanka v Bangladesh Test in Galle which the hosts won in an emphatic fashion. Bangladesh batsman   was clean bowled by   during the visitorâ€™s second innings but he still opted for reviewing that decision. 
 
 A well-set Sarkar was batting on 53 when he failed to read a delivery from spinner Gunaratne that was pitched on middle and off and spun away to beat his bat and pad to clip the off stump. The Sri Lankans appealed and the umpire took a moment before raising his finger.
 
 But Sarkar had no clue where the ball had travelled to and probably seeing the umpire taking some time before making the decision, he signalled for the review system. As the replays cleared he was out bowled, Sarkar had to take a long walk back to the dressing room before his team eventually was bowled out for 197 runs to lose by 259 runs.
