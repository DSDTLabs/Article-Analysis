 TOI reported on Tuesday the torture the young girl from Jhotwara was put through by her family, to prevent the couple from getting together. Commission’s chairperson Suman Sharma said, “We were so angry that the parents of the girl had nearly shaved off all her hair and tortured her. We first called them and told them that what they did was a criminal offence. In the past two days, we have been in talks with parents of both the young woman and the man she loves. The two are both about 20 years old, so we roped in the families. It seemed to us that they were a stable couple, and we encouraged the parents to allow the marriage. The families have now come around, there is no dowry in this, and the wedding will be performed at noon on Thursday. We are also getting a court marriage done so the young woman is secure.”
