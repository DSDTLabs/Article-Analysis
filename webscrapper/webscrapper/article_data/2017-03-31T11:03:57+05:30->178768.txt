NEW DELHI:  , though denied tickets, have been asked to make presentations showcasing their “achievements“. The first in the series was the east corporation whose mayor, leader of the house and standing committee chairman on Thursday outlined the civic body's initiatives in the past five years.

 Although badly cash strapped, the corporation cited waiving of the house tax for properties up to 50 Guz -a large chunk in east Delhi -as one of its achievements. The step was taken in February during its annual budget.
 
 BJP, however, has protested against the house tax waiver promised by AAP. Standing committee chairman Jitender Chaudhary said, “Section 177 of Delhi Municpal Corporation Act empowers the civic body to provide temporary tax relief. We are not talking about total removal of the tax but a relief for poor.“
 
 Experts, however, said the same route might be used by AAP.
 
 “While we came to power, we had 24% expenses of the joint MCD and only 14% of the income. The deficit of Rs 1,000 crore created adverse situations but we have managed to perform well,“ said Rajender Babbar, vice-president in Delhi BJP.
