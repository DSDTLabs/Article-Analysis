VIJAYAWADA: In a change of strategy, the TDP has decided to call off its proposed bus yatra by party MPs. Instead, party president and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will address public meetings across the state, beginning with one in Guntur on April 20, and convey to the people the betrayal by BJP-led NDA government. 

 TDP MPs, who were to return from Delhi and set out on a bus yatra across the 13 districts, have been told to go to their respective constituencies and hold separate meetings. "After meeting party leaders at his camp office on Tuesday, the CM has decided against the bus yatra and instead focus on big public meetings to be addressed by him and smaller interactions by TDP elected representatives," a source said.
 
 Naidu will hold a public meet in Guntur on April 20 followed by another in   on April 30. In the Guntur meet, the CM would counter  's campaign against TDP and highlight the "villainous" roles played by   and  . According to party sources, the Tirupati meet will coincide with the fourth anniversary of PM  's election meeting in 2014 where he had promised special status for AP.
 
 "Naidu will replay Modi's speeches made in Tirupati and Amaravati and tell the people they have been betrayed by false promises. This would be the main theme of Naidu's speeches," said a source. The dates and venues for other public meetings will be finalised in the next few days.
