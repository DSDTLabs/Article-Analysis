NEW DELHI:   (IOA) is likely to name a 335-member contingent for the   Commonwealth Games (CWG), which may see as many as 27   officials accompanying the contingent in different capacities. It’s also learnt that a total of 74 support staff and coaches will travel with 222 athletes to the Games, scheduled from April 4 to 15.

 
 Seven press attaché and three contingent managers, along with   as the chef-de-mission, will form the other part of the contingent. IOA is still in the process of finalising the names, a reason why the list of contingent hasn’t reached the sports ministry’s doorsteps yet. The ministry is fuming over the delay since – according to an official – several logistical issues need to be taken care of.
 
 It would be interesting to see how the ministry reacts to the list of 27 officials. The ministry has been very particular about cutting down on the contingent size, especially on the officials’ front. Of course, the IOA could always contend that since they have found enough sponsors for the CWG, they can fund the officials’ trip and wouldn’t depend on government funding.
