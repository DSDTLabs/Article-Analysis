UDHAGAMANDALAM: Residents of   village near   in the Nilgiris petitioned the district collector condemning the local police who had arrested a man from the village on Friday.

 The police personnel, who were not in uniform, did not reveal why   was secured, the residents said. “Also, the police personnel did not carry an arrest warrant,” a villager said.
 
 “We have given a petition to the collector seeking her intervention. The rude behaviour of the police personnel while securing Dhaya Shankar is highly condemnable. A policeman snatched a mobile phone from his wife and threw it away,” the villager added.
 
 Meanwhile, police sources said that Dhaya Shankar was arrested in connection with a fire incident.
 
  “A   liquor shop near Jagathala village was set on fire on July 20. Dhaya Shankar has been identified as one of the suspects in connection with the incident. He was secured from his house in the village on Friday morning for interrogation,” a police officer told TOI.
 
 The villagers also demanded the collector to shift the Tasmac shop located in the village. 
 
 “After receiving the petition, the collector said she would consider shifting the liquor shop after inspecting the location,” the villager added.
