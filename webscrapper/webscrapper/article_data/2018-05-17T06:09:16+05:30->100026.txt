MUMBAI: The teenager who leapt off the 14th floor of a   highrise on Tuesday had sent apology messages to a few of his school friends on WhatsApp minutes before taking the extreme step, said   cops after going through his cellphone data on Wednesday. 

 
 The 15-year-old left his grandfather's 10th floor flat around 2.30am and went to the refuge area on the 14th floor where he spent hours before jumping off the building around 5.55am. 
 
 "Around 3am, the teen had sent the same message on   apologizing to everyone for his act. The exact motive of his action is unclear but it is suspected that he was upset after being scolded for playing games on his mobile phone late at night and for not sleeping," said a Samta Nagar police officer.
 
 His father, who was in   on work, returned to the city on Wednesday. 
 
 "He posted on a WhatsApp group that he had lost his son and requested that his family be left alone in this difficult time. He said he would inform us about the last rites," a person known to the family told TOI.
