NOIDA: The wife of a gardener, who had been diagnosed with   in her womb, has delivered  , taking doctors at the district hospital by surprise.

 Radha, a resident of   village in Sector 12, already has a five-year-old daughter. While the three baby girls she delivered on Sunday morning are doing well, the condition of her son is a bit critical and he has been transferred to a neighbouring child hospital for observation.
 
 Although the family is happy with the babies, the husband-wife duo are equally worried about their upkeep.
 
 “My husband earns around Rs 7,000 a month and we already have a daughter. It is not about a daughter or a son. We are worried about the financial expenses we have to incur to bring them up,” Radha said from her bed at the district hospital.
 
 “With our minimal income, it will be extremely difficult for us to raise five children. We are hoping to get government support,” she added.
 
 Radha said she was expecting twins as the private health centre she had visited for a check-up a few months ago had told her so.
 
 “It was my second pregnancy and I wasn’t aware that I would deliver quadruplets. I already have a five-year-old daughter. There is a private health centre in Sector 35 where I had got an ultrasound done. They said I had twins and I knew about the two kids,” she told TOI.
 
 Dr Archana Tyagi, who oversaw the normal delivery, said she, too, wasn’t aware of the quadruplets.
 
 “I had left the delivery after the two daughters were born, but noticed suddenly that that it was yet to be complete,” she said.
 
 Radha said she was worried about the condition of her son, who continued to be in a critical condition. At the time of delivery, the boy was under-weight (below 1.4kg) and is currently on ventilator support in the NICU.
