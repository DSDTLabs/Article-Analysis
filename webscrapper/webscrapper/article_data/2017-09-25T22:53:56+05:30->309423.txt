MUMBAI: The slab of a portion of a ground plus four storey building at   in   collapsed yesterday evening. However as the structure was largely vacant no one was trapped under the debris.

 On Monday evening, around 6.30 pm the Mumbai fire brigade received a call about the second and third floor slab   building at   Road having crashed. Three fire engines were rushed to the spot. "There were commercial shops on the ground floor. The back side portion of the second and third floor of the structure collapsed largely and therefore no person was injured. Those working on the ground floor of the building were immediately pulled out. The ground floor however is still intact,” said Devidas Kshirsagar-assistant municipal commissioner of   D ward.
 
 Haziz Habib is a MHADA cess building. “A watchman was also present in the building who immediately ran out," said a BMC official.
