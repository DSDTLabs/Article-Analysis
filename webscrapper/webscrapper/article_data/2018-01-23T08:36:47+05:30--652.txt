 Villagers and members of  , a pelican conservation group, said the mating patterns and other habits of the migratory birds were normal. 
 
 "On Monday, three birds fell from a rain tree. Th e feet, legs and t he fleshy pouch under the beaks of all the dead birds were much darker. The pouch, which is supposed to be red, turned darker around the time they died,"  , president of the  , said. 
 
  Officials from the forest department and range forest officer Rajeshwari N S visited the site a month ago to look into the deaths and ruled out the possibility of bird flu. 
 
  "In December, four bird carcasses were taken for tests and worms were found in the stomach that had led to the deaths. Monday's deaths are the first after spraying of antibiotics. We had done a similar exercise in 2016," said range forest officer N S Rajeshwari.
