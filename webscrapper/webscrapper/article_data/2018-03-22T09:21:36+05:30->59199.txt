Bollywood’s Baadshah   might be busy with his professional commitments, but that doesn’t stop him from spending quality time with his family. Shah Rukh’s youngest child   is the apple of his eye. So much so that he takes him along to every possible film shoot and spends quality time with him between takes and rehearsals. And despite his hectic schedule, doting daddy SRK has taken some time off and is vacationing with wife Gauri Khan and son AbRam in Switzerland.

 Gauri took to Instagram to share a picture of her hubby and son with the caption, “Snowmen... ⛄️ ❤️ @iamsrk”
 
  
  
 
 SRK too shared a picture on his Twitter handle with a caption, “@gaurikhan here’s the rest of it...My lil holiday with the lil big skier...in the bed, in the lift, in the  ...With him, one does get more than one can ski...always.”
 
  
  
 
 From the pictures, we can see how much fun are they having in the snow, away from the city's heat and traffic.
