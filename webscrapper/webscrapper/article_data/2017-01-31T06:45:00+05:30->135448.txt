CHANDIGARH: Former Congress leader and former deputy speaker of Punjab assembly   Singh on Monday extended his unconditional support to AAP in the presence of party candidate Dr Balbir Singh and leader   on Monday in Patiala.

 Dr Balbir Singh told TOI that Bir Devinder was the one who had brought allegations of corruption against   president Capt   to light and his support has come as a shot in the arm for his party. “He has considerable personal influence in the area and will campaign for AAP. However, he has not formally joined AAP.” In Patiala, Dr Balbir Singh is pitted against Capt Amarinder.
 
 After making a comeback to Congress, Devinder had again parted ways after being expelled for six years last year. The move had come despite Congress strategist Prashant Kishor’s efforts to resolve the differences between the former Deputy Speaker and Capt Amarinder Singh. He has not joined any party after that.
 
 Meanwhile, Gautambir Singh, media in-charge of   and close aide of TMC Punjab chief Jagmeet Singh Brar joined AAP in the presence of party’s state in-charge Sanjay Singh.
 
 Welcoming the new entrants, Sanjay Singh said people are fed up with the working style of traditional political parties and want to change the political system in state.
