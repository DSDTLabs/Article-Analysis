Rajkot: Around 73 persons complained of vomiting, stomach ache and loose motion after having food at a marriage function in Khirsara village of Keshod taluka in Junagadh district on Tuesday. 

 All were rushed to Keshod government hospital. Nearly 600 people had come to attend the marriage of local resident Pravin Gondalia’s son that was followed by lunch. The guests were served vegetarian food with some milk sweets. Those admitted told doctors that they felt uneasy after consuming the dessert.
 
 Initially, few people complained of uneasiness, but the number grew as time passed. They were first taken to the primary health centre in the village and later shifted to Keshod hospital and 108 emergency ambulances called from Vanthli, Manavadar, Maliya Hatina, Gadu and Keshod. 
 
 Private practitioners were called in the government hospital for assistance. Four people — three women and a man — were shifted to Junagadh Civil hospital after their health deteriorated. 
 
 N K Vanza, Keshod police sub-inspector, said, “We suspect food poisoning and have sent the samples for testing.”
