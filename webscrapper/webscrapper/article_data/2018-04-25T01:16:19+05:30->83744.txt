Udhagamandalam: Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya issued naththam pattas to 155 residents of Kinnakorai in the district on Tuesday. The village, nestling in a valley close to Kerala border and located 65km away from Ooty, lacks water and health facilities. Kinnakorai village comprising about 8 hamlets houses nearly 500 families. The market value of naththam lands has been out at Rs 7.27 lakh. A special grama sabha was conducted at Kinnakorai village to mark the National Panchayati Raj Day. The villagers petitioned the collector for opening of the Kinnakorai-Geddai road to facilitate them to reach Mettupalayam, a distance of 30km. Else they have to travel a distance of around 100km via Ooty Road to reach Mettupalayam. They also requested the collector to set up a primary health centre in the village.  Further, the villagers requested for a permanent line-man for the village. While speaking on the occasion, Divya assured the villagers that they would soon get a permanent line-man. “Dialogues will be held with health department for a primary health centre in Kinnkorai. With regard to water facility to the village the damaged old water lines will be replaced with new pipes”, she added. In connection with Kinnakorai Geddai road, there is an objection by the forest department as around 500 metres of the road falls under reserve forest area. “We will soon arrive at a balanced decision after having a detailed dialogue with the forest department”, said the collector.
