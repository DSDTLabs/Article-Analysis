CHENNAI: Calf meat brought illegally to the city from neighbouring states ends up on your table, in the plate of biriyani that you ordered in restaurants and at roadside stalls, often without your knowledge and toteh detriment of your health.

 But lacunae in the rule book is preventing the city corporation and state food safety department from taking action against traders responsible for the illegal import.
 
 The corporation health department has in 10 days thrice impounded meat for being illegally transported to the city. All the cases were in Chintadripet and they were all the handiwork of a repeat offender, Sakthivel. “He lives in Chintadripet but sells meat in Egmore,” said Chintadripet police inspector Sahadevan.
 
 Sakthivel obtained bail every time by paying a small sum as a fine. The police tried to hold him under IPC Section 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), but little came of the attempts.
 
 There is no provision under the  , 1919, to penalise such offenders, officials said.
 
 “The procedure istosend samples to labs, wait for a report and then pursue a case. The time taken allows offenders to walk free,” a food safety officer said. “The district collector can charge a suspect under Section 110 of the CrPC and declare him a habitual offender. We have to work around the shortcomings in the law in the interest of public safety.”
 
 Retired Madras high court judge   said a grey area in law, in which no department or wing has the power to take action, was at the bottom of the problem.
 
 “Unless the high court pushes for changes to legislation, that is unlikely to happen,” he said.
