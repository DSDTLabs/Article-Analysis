LUDHIANA: Police on Sunday arrested a 20-year-old law student for stealing his neighbour's SUV. 

  Kant, who is pursuing LLB from a   college, stole the SUV while playing truth-and-dare game with his friends, police said. 
 
 "The youth has confessed to the crime. He said when they were playing truth and dare at his house in Sohi Street, College Road, his friends dared him to steal his neighbour's car," a cop added. 
 
 Inquiry officer sub-inspector Angrej Singh said, "Ranjeesh Dhir, a cycle parts manufacturer, had parked his SUV outside his house. Both the families are good friends and Anand would often visit their house." 
 
 On Saturday, Anand went to Dhir's house and stole the keys of his SUV. The next morning around 10am, he sped away with the vehicle. When Dhir found his SUV missing, he checked the footage of   cameras installed outside his house. He called up the police on seeing Anand taking away his four-wheeler. Cops soon reached the spot and started tracing Anand after scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in naerby areas. 
 
 Police said Anand had taken the SUV to his friend's residence in   to show that he had met the challenge. 
 
 Police have booked Anand, the son of a former professor of SCD Government College.
