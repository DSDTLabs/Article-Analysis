New Delhi: Alleging that the BJP-led corporations were corrupt, Aam Aadmi Party questioned the achievements of East Delhi Municipal Corporation that were highlighted in a report card earlier this week.

 AAP shared statistics to claim that the corporation failed in management of waste and garbage.   pointed out that in November last year, the Delhi high court had lashed out at the civic bodies for the poor state of sanitation. He quoted the court order, “The problem is that there is no garbage removal mechanism. What is your action plan? How will you clean Delhi? The corporations failed to provide an efficient garbage removal system”. Pandey added, “Later, the CAG report came and it hit out at the corporations over the spread of chikunguniya, dengue and malaria. They failed to keep a check on mosquito breeding and wasted funds on insecticides”.
 
 On solid waste management, Pandey alleged that “last year’s CAG report said the corporations were able to dispose only 25% of the garbage and they have no long-term plan”. “Ghazipur landfill is 50 metres high, even when environment norms say it should not be more than 20-25 metres. The construction and demolition waste management plant is yet to be made functional,” Pandey added.
 
 Pandey also shared data and sought to know “how the civic body running in a cash deficit of about Rs 180 crore be presenting a report card of achievements”. Pandey said, “East corporation is claiming success in giving healthcare facilities. From 2012-13, the Delhi government had given Rs 10 crore for development of infrastructure of hospitals but that amount is being carried forward every year. When the hospitals are in poor shape, why is the money not being utilised”. Meanwhile, water minister Kapil Mishra put out a video message for the public, reiterating Kejriwal’s claim that both BJP and Congress parties have “hatched a conspiracy” to snatch the power and water departments from the government.
