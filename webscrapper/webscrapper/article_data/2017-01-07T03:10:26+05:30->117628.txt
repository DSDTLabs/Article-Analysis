NEW DELHI: Under a new initiative,   is looking to fund projects through corporate social responsibility. At present, it has identified four such projects, including decentralised sewage treatment using natural treatment systems, rejuvenation of   bodies and baolis across Delhi, conservation of   water body and water ATMs.

 Sources explained that for new technologies, government agencies like   have neither enough   nor policy guidelines to test them and hence, if someone was willing to invest in their trials, it would help them set up such projects and test their viability.
 
 “All these projects have been tested at least in one place in India or abroad and DJB has a detailed project report drawn up for them. However, in a hierarchy of projects that DJB has to implement, these are not in the top but are still important. The Board has therefore decided to seek financial assistance through   and if the impact of these projects if worthwhile, then the government can take them up formally at a later stage,” said a source.
 
 According to officials, corporates have already expressed interest in the projects, including a few telecom and tech companies.
 
 The four projects for which funds are being sought include decentralised sewage treatment using natural treatment systems. NEERI and IIT Bombay hold the patent for this technology which has reduced the cost of small sewage treatment plants by a large margin and these are the types of plants that Delhi needs. Rejuvenation of water bodies and baolis is another project for which funds are being sought. DJB has already installed water ATMs at a few locations in the city and is looking for CSR funds to set up more.
