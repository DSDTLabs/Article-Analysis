Adoor Gopalakrishnan, National award winner and filmmaker lashes out against the attitude of public towards award films.

 The veteran director spoke about it at a public event held recently at Kozhikode. He said that the cramming of viewers at the theatres to watch films like  's   reveals our culture. He said at present films are not receiving any recognition just like those received earlier for National award-winning film,  . The public have developed a mentality that there is no need to go and watch a film if it is an award movie, Adoor explained.
 
 The filmmaker concluded saying, that though he had made films revolving around the Malayali viewers here, the true acknowledgement was received from outside the state and abroad.
