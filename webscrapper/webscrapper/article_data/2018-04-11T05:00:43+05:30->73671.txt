KOLKATA: A luxury cab driver,   (40), was shot dead on Monday night by unknown assailants at his Noapara home in  . The victim was having dinner around 11.30pm when the incident occurred. He died on the spot after the bullet hit his ribs.

 Cops said someone called out   from outside his house. “When he approached the door, a person fired at him from a window. His son failed to spot any assailant,” said a source. Police said that Mistri’s wife   claimed that Samir’s recent involvement in real estate business was behind the murder.
