HYDERABAD: Water woes in at least 11 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) peripherals are expected to worsen this summer. Works pertaining to  , construction of service  , which were scheduled to be completed this month, is moving at a snail's pace.

 For instance, a total of 56 service reservoirs, including 'ground level service reservoirs' (GLSRs) and ' ' (ELSRs) were proposed in these 11  . But work on 54 of those reservoirs is yet to begin as land in the proposed Kowkur and Jonnabanda villages have not yet started.
 
 The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), which is the implementing agency , earlier claimed that works would be completed by March and ensured that water would be supplied before summer. The government sanctioned `1,900 crore to complete the water supply improvement project in these 11GHMC peripherals and said the water supply project would benefit 15 lakh population. Currently , the Water Board is supplying water three to four days a week in few of these GHMC peripherals.
 
 “The water supply project is aimed at supplying 16 million gallons of Godavari water per day to 11 GHMC peripherals after completion. But the works are delayed due to road cutting permission and land acquisi tion. Rainy season and demonetisation (workers not available) were also major hurdles for laying of pipeline works,“ HMWS&SB chief general manager, project construction circle-III, D Ramachandra Reddy told TOI.
 
 Similar problems exist over the Malkajgiri Comprehensive Water Supply Improvement Scheme, which was to be completed by November 2016 as per the schedule. But it has been extended by another five months.“We are confident that by next month, works pertaining to 12 service reservoirs will be completed,“ said a senior HMWS&SB official.
 
 As a result of the delays, doubts have cropped up over water supplies to 15 lakh residents in the GHMC peripherals and Malkajgiri GHMC circle during this summer.
