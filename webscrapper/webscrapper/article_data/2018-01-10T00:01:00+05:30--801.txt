Vellore: Nearly 750 state transport employees, along with their family members, staged a demonstration in front of the Vellore regional office of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) Limited here pressing for their demands, including a wage revision, as the transport union strike entered the sixth day on Tuesday.

  The employees have been demanding to fix the minimum basic pay (at Rs 19,500 per month), to have a wage hike of 2.57% every three years and to settle the dues of the retired employees.
 
  The employees are planning to stage a demonstration in front of labour office, as part of the state-wide protest, on Wednesday, said CITU district secretary S Parasuraman. Despite the strike, the TNSTC has been operating around 80% of the buses by roping in temporary drivers. The police department escorted several buses to ensure the safety of the passengers and to avert any stone pelting incidents.
