CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president Capt   has asked the Centre and Haryana the government to take all necessary steps to prevent any violation of Punjab's borders by Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), which has threatened to march from Haryana into the state to start the digging of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal on February 23.

 Reacting to INLD leader  's statement that his party workers were ready to force their way into neighbouring Punjab from Ambala, with or without permission from the district administration, Amarinder has demanded action by the Haryana government to prevent the eruption of an inter-state crisis.
 
 “Chautala's inflammatory statement has the potential of further escalating tension already triggered by the ongoing Jat agitation in Haryana,“ said Amarinder, asking the Centre to also initiate stern measures to maintain law and order.
 
 With the code of conduct still in place in Punjab and elections in progress in some other states, Amarinder asked the Election Commission (EC) to take note of the development and direct the Centre to intervene to ensure that peace is maintained at all costs.
 
 Amarinder asked the SAD-led Punjab government to protect the state's borders from any infringement. “It is time for chief minister   to prove his self-proclaimed commitment to protecting the interests of Punjab,“ he said. Amarinder warned Badal against “betraying“ the people of Punjab again.
 
 He accused the Chautalas of indulging in political misadventure and trying to take advantage of their proximity to the Badals.
