Surat: Residents of Baleswar village near Palsana in Surat district have been complaining of a pungent smell during night hours for some time now, but Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) has chosen to disregard their cries for help.  Residents of the area could not sleep twice in the last one week because of this pungent smell which is a health hazard to not only them but other villages in the vicinity too. The source of foul smell could be one of the five industries in the area.  Jayesh Patel, a resident of Baleswar village, told TOI, “We have two Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP), a pharmaceutical unit, a dyeing and chemical unit and an incinerator plant. All of them release foul odour in the area. We have complained several times to GPCB officials but nothing has been done so far.”  The pungent smell forced people of Baleswar village to come out of their houses on Thursday night. They found an employee of a unit checking the extent to which the foul odour was stinging one’s nostrils. He was caught by local people and his superiors called for a talk.  Devang Patel, a resident of the village, said, “Recycling of water at CETP kills bacteria but it creates a foul smell. The dyeing and chemical unit creates a pungent smell by releasing mixed gases. Burning of hazardous waste also creates foul odour.”  GPCB in-charge official Sajiv Viajnapurkar said, “We had issued closure notice to Geo Hybrid Industrial Solution Private Limited’s incinerator plant in the past. We issued it a notice in May and also asked it to keep its odour under control. It is a hazardous waste disposal plant and creates maximum foul smell in the area. We are monitoring the situation in the village closely.”
