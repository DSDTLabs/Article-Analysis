KOZHIKODE:   president   said on Monday that the   government has lost its `humane' face.
After inaugurating the hunger strike organized by the UDF at Valayam on Monday in protest against the delay in arresting those responsible for the death of Jishnu Pranoy, Sudheeran said that the state government was not protecting public interest in this case. The BTech student was found hanging at the hostel of the Nehru college of Engineering and   at Pampady.
 
 “The gap between chief minister and public interest has widened. The state go vernment is protecting the interests of those who viola ted the law. Though Jishnu's family submitted a compliant to the chief minister, detailing the lapses that had happened in the way police handled the case, no steps were taken to provide justice,“ he said. Sudheeran said that he could not understand the reason why the chief minister failed to visit the house of Jishnu to console the family.“The chief minister should be more humane,“ he said, adding that the government should provide a job to Jishnu's mother Mahija.
 
 Sudheeran visited the house of Jishnu before arriving at the venue of agitation.
