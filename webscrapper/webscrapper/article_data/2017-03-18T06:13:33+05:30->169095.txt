JAIPUR: The Jaipur police arrested 18 bookies allegedly involved in a multi-crore assembly election betting racket on late Thursday night.The bookies had come to the state capital to attend a `meeting' to discuss the heavy losses incurred following the  's unprecedented victory in   polls.

 Deputy commissioner of police (Jaipur-east) Kunwar Rashtradeep told TOI that the `kingpins of the racket' had refused to make outstanding payments to bookies after the election results. This triggered panic among bookies who called a meeting at a ho tel to prepare a further strategy. However, the main kingpins did not come to attend the meeting.
 
 “The bookies were under pressure to pay up the money which they had collected from people during the course of multi-phase polling,“ Rashtradeep said. “The bookies had incurred heavy losses as they had predicted around 200 seats for BJP but the party got over 300 seats,“ Rashtradeep said, adding that the meeting was organised at a leading hotel in the garb of a `conference.' A specific input was received that about 70 bookies were staying at a posh hotel near   area, said police.
 
 “Bookies from Delhi, Punjab, UP and different districts of Rajasthan had come to attend the meeting,“ Rashtradeep said.
 
 Soon after the meeting on Thursday night, the cops arrested 18 bookies under Sec tion 151 (preventive detention) of CrPC, while others fled. Rashtradeep said that police were filing a suo motu FIR against the accused.
 
 A senior official told TOI that bookies had placed bets to the tune of about Rs 500 crore; however, their bosses refused to pay up the promised amount post poll results. “We are examining the   footage of the hotel to check who all had come to attend the meeting,“ the official said.
