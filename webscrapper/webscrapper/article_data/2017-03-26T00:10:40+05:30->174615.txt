Panaji: Coach   is likely to persist with   despite the availability of regular captain   Fernandes for the   final on Sunday.
 
  Francis, a former India midfielder and among the four players to have won the Santosh Trophy in the past, led Goa for the first three matches but sat out of the last two games, including the semifinal, with injury. Costa handpicked Peter to lead the team for the last two matches and the Quepem-born veteran did a wonderful job at the heart of Goa’s defence.
  
  For the final, Costa is faced with a dilemma but it is unlikely that he will snatch the armband from Peter.
  
  “Francis is our regular captain but I have to see whether he is fit enough to start. A call will be taken after consultations with the physiotherapist in the morning,” said Costa.
  
  Even if Francis is fit, he is only likely to be handed a second-half role.
