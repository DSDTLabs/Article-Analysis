KOLKATA: The   ( ) promised to take Indian football to the next level. But behind the candelabra lie a number of queries, as exemplified by the midnight madness around defending champions  's home match against   at the   on Wednesday.

 In a first in Indian football, the match kicked off at 10.45 pm and went on well past midnight.  's fourth-minute goal for ATK was cancelled out by FC Goa's Spanish striker and current top-scorer   in the 24th minute.
 
 The 1-1 result was a moral victory for FC Goa, given the odds they had to overcome in taking the field. Having landed at the Kolkata airport at 9 pm, the FC Goa team went straight to the stadium and got into the game without a proper warmup session. Organisers are yet to come up with an explanation as to what prompted them to go ahead with the fixture so late on a January night and put the players at risk of being injured.
 
 FC Goa coach Sergio Lobera, however, made no bones about his displeasure. "I have never faced (such a situation) in professional football. ISL is a great league but it doesn't deserve matches like this. The circumstances we faced in the last couple of days did not permit us to play this game. I think it called for a force majeure," Lobera said.
 
 ATK coach Teddy Sheringham described it as 'unusual.' "It is the first time I've finished a game at 1 am and this is very unusual," he said.
