This firm is currently maintaining the cricket stadium in Dehradun and is a partner in the GIFT City, Gandhinagar,” the official added. The stadium committee will now forward its decision to the managing committee that will take a final call.
 
 When contacted, BCA treasurer Amul Jikar said, “We cannot reveal the decision of the stadium committee as it is confidential. The managing committee will take decision about hiring the firm.” He refused to comment further. 
 
 The association had acquired 74 bighas of land in Kotambi in 2013 but the stadium project got delayed due to the NA permission, which the BCA finally got last year. The managing committee then passed a resolution to build cricket stadium in Kotambi in January this year. 
 
 BCA plans to build a state-of- art cricket stadium with a capacity of more than 40,000 spectators along with big dressing rooms and other sporting facilities for the players.
