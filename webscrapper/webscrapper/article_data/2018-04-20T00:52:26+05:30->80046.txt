 The victim, R Thangaraj, was walking towards his home at Sivanandha Colony near Gandhi Nagar Junction on Thursday morning when K Radhakrishnan approached him. “Two of his relatives Arumugham and Paramasivam also reached the spot. They picked up a quarrel with Thangaraj, alleging that he is converting Hindus to Christianity. During the heated argument, Radhakrishnan took out a sickle and attacked Thangaraj. The others tried to stop him and calmed him down. Thangaraj sustained injuries on his head and shoulders. He was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital,” a police officer said.
 
 Thangaraj told police that Radhakrishnan had been threatening to murder him for several years. “Everytime, he saw him, he would tell him that he was converting others to Christianity and threatened him,” said a pastor. 
 
 Thangaraj, police said, had earlier held a party post in BJP in ward 50 in the Coimbatore corporation. He had converted to Christianity in 1994. While party men did not confirm if he was still a BJP member, police said while he was a BJP worker, he was not active.
 
 Rathinapuri police registered a case and are investigating the incident. They arrested Radhakrishnan later in the evening and booked a case for promoting disharmony between religions, uttering obscene words, voluntarily causing hurt using a weapon and for criminal intimidation. Police said he will be remanded in judicial custody.
