  Speaking to Mirror, Krishna said, “Within one hour there were around 20 different links on which it h a d b e e n u p l o a d e d .

  l We just wanted to reveal the look. Of course watching it on the big screen is a different experience altogether. So we are not releasing the video songs of the film now. Only the teasers of three more songs will be released before the film hits the big screen. And then there is the trailer that fans are awaiting.It will be the bumper offer before the film's release,“ Krishna said.
  
  The film brings together Sudeep and Ravichandran together on screen again after Maanikya. Ravichandran played Sudeep's father in the earlier film; in Hebbuli he plays his elder brother. Sudeep is playing a military officer for the first time in his career.
