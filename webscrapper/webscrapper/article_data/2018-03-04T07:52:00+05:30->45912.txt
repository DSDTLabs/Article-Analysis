Ludhiana: Railway authorities at local level have approached a number of several non-government organisations (NGOs) to paint graffiti on the boundary walls as well as foot overbridge of the Ludhiana railway station, which may play an important role in enhancing its overall look.

 The city station is already facing a lot of flak due to the alleged apathy of the railway officials towards maintaining cleanliness.
 
 Director of Ludhiana railway station Abhinav Singla said, “We have called up several city-based NGOs to carry out graffiti works on the boundary walls as well as foot overbridge, which will help in beautifying the city station. Earlier too the authorities have put up graffiti works on the foot overbridge. However, within months of its completion, the stain of Paan on them ruined them. This was a major embarrassment for both the railway officials and the frequent passengers.”
 
 “This time, the railway has also given a freehand to some college and university authorities to bring their students at Ludhiana railway station and carry out graffiti and design works as it has been done on some of the city flyovers.”
 
 Moreover, we are looking for some NGOs, which can install sanitary pad disposal machines at the ladies’ washrooms inside the premises of the railway station.
 
 Escalator to function from April 1st week
 
 The completion of escalator project has already missed several deadlines in past more than a year. Station director Abhinav Singla said the construction department officials will take one more month to complete the much-awaited project as the railway authorities have given another final deadline. Final date has been fixed in the first week of April, said Singla.
