RANCHI: In the interiors of Jharkhand's   district, Limra village is a classic example of the gap between policy on paper and its execution on ground. When you visit this small village it is hard to miss the many newly toilet units next to the huts. Some are still being given the final touches but structurally they appear rough and very weak.
