Actor   believes he would have been a great Joker had he been given an opportunity to play the iconic comic book  . The 54-year-old actor, who played the superhero character   in two films and voiced   in 'Teen Titans Go! To The Movies', said he has moved onto other things as his comic book days are behind him. 

 "I'm onto other things, but I always thought I'd make a great Joker and I always thought that I would've been a good villain in one of the Marvel (movies) like Doctor Doom. But, Doctor Doom you have to wear that mask, but I thought the story leading up to Doctor Doom could've been interesting," Cage said.
 
 "At this point if I was to go back into the format it would probably have to be as a villain," he added. Cage said the role of Joker would 'be the perfect' for him because he could 'go even more off the rails' than he normally does.
