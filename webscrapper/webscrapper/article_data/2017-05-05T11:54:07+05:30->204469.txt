MUMBAI: The   on Thursday stayed the addendum to the racing license issued by the   which sought to restrict voting to the  's   elections only to those members who attend races for minimum 15% of days. The order was passed by Justice A S Oka and Justice A K Menon. Senior Counsel   appeared for the petitioners   and others.

 There was great anger among members of the RWITC last year in April when the condition was imposed. Many members believed that not attending races due to various constraints despite passionate interest in the sport should not be reason for disqualification of their voting rights.
 
 With the stay order, it appears that the status quo prevails for this year. Should the Government impose this condition in the new license for the year 2017-18, it will be up to the respective parties to either challenge it or support it.
 
 Sources say the stay was granted on limited technical grounds and the merits of the case were not deliberated. However, the power to impose the condition in future rests with the state.
