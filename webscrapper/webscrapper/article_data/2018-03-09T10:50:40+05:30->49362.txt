MUMBAI:   will launch its Rs 4,473-crore initial public offering ( ) — the largest by any bank in India — on March 15. The bank will be selling 1,193 lakh shares, representing 10% of its post-IPO capital, at a price range of Rs 370-375. This values the company at around Rs 44,700 crore at the higher end.

 The bank will sell up to 977 lakh new shares in the IPO, which will close for subscription on March 19. The remaining 216 lakh shares are an offer for sale by  , which is part of the World Bank Group, and IFC FIG. Bandhan, which earlier operated as a micro-finance company, obtained a full-fledged banking licence along with IDFC in 2014. The bank started operations in August 2015. The current pricing makes the three-year-old lender the eighth most valuable bank in the country, just after Yes Bank. State Bank of India is the only public sector lender to have a higher valuation than Bandhan Bank.
 
 Speaking at the launch, founder and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh said that one of the conditions for obtaining a banking licence was that the promoters dilute their holding through an IPO within three years. He said that although the bank had a capital adequacy of 24%, it would need capital as it was growing at 30%.
 
 The Kolkata-headquartered bank had reported a net profit of Rs 960 crore for the nine months ended December 2017 as compared to Rs 1,100 crore for FY17. The bank has a network of 887 branches and 433 ATMs.
 
 As on December 31, 2017, Bandhan Bank’s deposits stood at Rs 25,293 crore, and advances at Rs 24,463 crore. The bank has converted its erstwhile business correspondent network into ‘doorstep service centres’ and now has a network of 2,763 representatives and 96 lakh micro-finance customers.
 
 Kotak Mahindra Capital, Axis Capital, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities,   and J P Morgan India are the book-running lead managers to the issue.
