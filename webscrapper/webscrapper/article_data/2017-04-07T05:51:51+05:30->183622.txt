CHARMINAR: Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen(MIM) president   on Thursday described cow protection vigilantes as terrorists even as he accused the Centre of appeasing these radical groups.

 Speaking to TOI, Owaisi rejected the expression 'cow protection activists' and said that these men are indulging in acts of terrorism in the guise of stopping cow slaughter. “They (cow vigilantes) are definitely going towards radicalisation or have already been radicalised. They are indulging in terrorism in the name of the cow. It is wrong to call them cow protection activists. It is actually because of the soft stand that the government has taken these groups they have become so emboldened (sic),“ he said. The Hyderabad parliamentarian said that the Centre should use its de-radicalisation programme on these cow protection vigilantes first. “The state governments should deal with them in the strictest possible way,“ he added.
