NEW DELHI: The ‘schools of excellence’ started   to nursery, KG, Class I and Class II for the new academic session on Thursday. The last date to submit forms is March 24. 

 Admission would be carried out on the basis of neighbourhood criteria in these English-medium government schools, with no screening of parents or the applicants. Classes would begin from April 2. 
 
 A DoE circular says preference would be given to students living within 1km of the school. In case there are not enough candidates from that distance range, students from 1-3km, 3-6km and beyond 6km would be taken. 
 
 Selection of students, where the number of applications is more than the number of seats, would be through draw of lots that’s scheduled for March 27. Results would be declared the day after. Intake would be between March 31 and April 5. In case seats stay vacant, heads of schools must keep wait-lists handy through the year to fill up those seats, the circular directed.
 
 The government has also observed an age limit, keeping nursery at three to four years, KG at four to five years, Class I at five to six years and Class II at six to seven years. Special age relaxation would be given to children with disabilities. 
 
 Parents would be given forms free of cost. Photographs, age and residence proofs would have to be provided but no child would be denied admission due to lack of documents. A 30-day window would be provided to get all papers. Each class would have three sections of not more than 25 students each.
