THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The average   due to   in the state every year is around 4,000. But, the   who   every year is  . 

 According to data, males, especially those in the age groups 30 to 44 and 45 to 60 lead the suicide table every year. In 2013, a total of 8,646 persons committed suicide. Among these, 6,701 were males and 1,945 were females. In 2014, the figure was 8,446 out of which 6,412 were males and 2,034 were females. In the year 2015, the total number of suicide victims was 7,692 (5,828 males, 1,864 females)
 
 "It is high time the authorities identify high suicide rate in the state as a public health issue," said Dr G Mohan Roy, consultant psychiatrist, Thiruvananthapuram medical college. The rise in suicides is also an index of rise in depressive disorder, which warrants equal importance as any other disease outbreak.
 
 Regarding the high number of men among suicide victims, Dr Mohan Roy said this has been the case globally. 'Statistically, even though women attempt suicide more, it is men who complete the attempt succesfully,'' he said. 
 
 This is because woman are genetically, socially and culturally more capable of handling pressures in life. It is often seen that men fail in handling midlife crisis, which drive them to extreme measures such as suicide. Family problems tops the list of causes of suicide of males followed by illness. Though the case is same for females too, their number is far less than that of the males.
