ONGOLE: The government has not paid ex gratia to even 10% of the family members of farmers who killed themselves in the last two-and-a half years. Only 96 of the 986 bereaved families received Rs 5 lakh since the   government came to power.

 This was revealed on Thursday by the   (HRF), which sourced the data from the   (DCRB). “It is an appalling state for the families of farmers who committed suicide to live without the support they are entitled to,“ said VS Krishna,   . He said that the government was rejecting several genuine cases on flimsy grounds. “Some were not given ex gratia as the land was not in the farmer's name,“ he said.
