Singer 
  Karthik's recent slanderous outbursts on social media has rocked and shaken many in   industry.She's taken on actors, actresses, composers, directors, and even producers, and has made oblique and even direct allegations of them seeking or receiving sexual favours in return for roles in films, and has even alleged being physically abused by a senior actor.

 
 
 While social media is all agog with Suchitra's tweets and her almost-daily declarations of what next she's going to leak, there's more to these scurrilous posts that meets the voyeuristic eye.While her husband Karthik, who   says in one of her alleged tweets she's divorced from, maintained a dignified silence when the controversy first erupted, sometime in the last week of February, later clarified that Suchitra's account was hacked.
 
 However, the hacking theory lacks substance because the account was not deactivated for the longest time, nor was there any let-up in the salacious and smutty posts, which also includes gross videos, being tweeted from it. The more cogent explanation for this bizarre behaviour from the singer is that she's not in the best of mental health presently. Reports of her suffering from some kind of manic bipolar disorder have also been doing the rounds. What adds a certain credibility to this is the fact that she's reportedly seeing a well-known psychiatrist for some time, an indication of which was given by the singer herself in yet another of her tweets, or at least in what was her official Twitter handle.
 
 However, what baffles and intrigues us is why and how Suchitra continues to have access to her social media accounts if indeed she's not in the right frame of mind, and in the event her account has been hacked, how is it that it took so long to deactivate it? We consider it unethical and insensitive to reproduce screenshots of those whose privacy has been compromised with by these indiscriminate and indiscreet tweets, here are a few of the controversial tweets.
