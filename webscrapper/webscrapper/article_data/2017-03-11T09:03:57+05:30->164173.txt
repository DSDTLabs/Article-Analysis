THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If it was   who surprised everyone in August 2004 by suddenly announcing his resignation as chief minister, it was the turn of his one-time lieutenant   on Friday when he announced that he was quitting as   president.

 Sudheeran, who had a fall during a public function at Kozhikode last week, cited health reasons for deciding to step down. “I have taken this decision purely on health grounds. There is nothing beyond that. I have not consulted any party leaders and it is purely my personal decision,’’ Sudheeran said at a hurriedly convened news conference.
 
 The party high command has its task cut out for it to find a replacement for Sudheeran. Both   and   had consistently tried to remove Sudheeran from the post but the latter’s sudden decision has, ironically, caught his rivals within the   on the wrong foot. The party which is going through a tough phase needs the service of a senior leader to rejuvenate it.
 
 Chandy is a popular choice but the high command may not be really enthused about him. Chandy himself has been sulking, and has kept away from major responsibilities after the Congress defeat in the last Assembly elections. On Friday too, Chandy repeated his decision to stay away.
