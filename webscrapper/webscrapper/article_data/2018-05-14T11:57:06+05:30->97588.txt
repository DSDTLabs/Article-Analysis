COIMBATORE: A PhD student of the Anna University’s Coimbatore regional centre on Sunday petitioned chief minister   when he was in Erode to address a gathering, seeking an inquiry commission to probe into the allegations against associate professor J Venkatesh of the Anna University regional centre.

  from Gobichettipalayam, in his petition, said in 2010 he had enrolled for PhD under Venkatesh. “Venkatesh had promised that he would help me finish my PhD in three years and had got money from me saying it was for DC meetings and for publishing research articles. At the end of three years, when I asked about the final thesis submission, he gave me contradictory information and demanded more money for completing my thesis,” he said in his petition. 
 
 Kirubaharan added that he had lost several lakhs of rupees to Venkatesh and several other students had also come out with similar complaints. “Despite several representations to the university, there has not been any action so far,”   said.
