VASCO: In a  , the   (MMC) on Friday resolved to ask crematoriums within its jurisdiction to refrain from   before cremation.

 MMC chief officer   told TOI that the council received directions from the directorate of municipal administration to inform crematoriums about it. “The crematorium in charge asked us to make a formal resolution first. We discussed the issue at the council meet and passed the resolution,” she said.
 
 In December last year, Bailancho Saad, an NGO, had petitioned the Goa Human Rights Commission to prevent disrobing of deceased women before cremation. In the letter, the NGO said that in some communities all the clothes of the deceased women are removed publicly in the crematorium, before placing the body on the pyre. This causes anguish to family and friends. Three such incidents have been brought to their notice.
 
 In one case when his young wife died during child birth, after a year of marriage, the husband was already in a state of shock when his wife was disrobed in front of his father, brother and other men. This traumatized him more. He also heard the men attending the funeral passing derogatory remarks. Women should not be abused this way, he said.
 
 Similarly, another young man felt helpless when his young wife was disrobed and the community dictated terms during the rituals of the cremation.
 
  volunteer approached the association after his son went into a state of shock. The volunteer had lost his mother and when his teenage son saw his grandmother being disrobed in front of men, he left the rituals midway.
 
 The NGO has since started a campaign ‘Prevent Public Disrobing of Women During Cremation’.
