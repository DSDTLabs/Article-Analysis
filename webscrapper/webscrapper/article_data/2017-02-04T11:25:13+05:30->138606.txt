VADODARA: The   (VMC)   on Friday did not take a decision on the proposal to give   to the city police for establishing a police station there. The standing committee has passed on the proposal to the general board that will now take it up.

 The city police had sought the land and was even going to pay for it. 
 
 The Panigate police station that is presently operating from a small premises opposite the   was to be shifted to a new building to be constructed at the site where the   once stood. The settlement along with shops was razed last year amidst violence.
