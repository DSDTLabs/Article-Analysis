New Delhi: For the second consecutive day, dense   stalled runway operations for nearly three hours at Indira Gandhi International ( )  , resulting in over 300 flights getting either delayed or cancelled, while backlog of flights continued for the rest of the day. Trains were equally hit with 15 being cancelled in the morning and over 50 getting delayed.

 According to airport officials, no plane could take off between 7.30am and 10am as the runway visual range (RVR) fell below 125 metres. While some flights were arriving intermittently during this period, no departure was possible as an aircraft requires more than 125 metres of RVR to take off. With no departure, it soon became difficult to find parking bays for arriving flights. 
 
 Nearly 270 domestic and around 70 international flights were delayed by Monday evening, while eight domestic ones were cancelled. Low-visibility procedures were initiated as early as 12.40am on Monday and continued till 1.35pm.
 
 The delays also meant a huge rush at the airport with people standing in queues for their flight to commence boarding. The delays for some flights extended for up to six hours and people took to Twitter to vent out their anger. Vistara Airlines has announced a waiver on changing/cancellation fees for all flights on January 1 and 2.
 
 An airport official said one flight had to be diverted due to a technical problem in the aircraft.
 
 Similar conditions were reported on Sunday when over 200 flights were delayed, diverted and cancelled after dense fog saw visibility falling below 50 metres. It led to runway operations being halted for nearly four hours till 11am.
 
 A railway official said that till 6.30am on Monday, 56 trains were delayed, 20 rescheduled and 15 cancelled. Over 400 trains were delayed till the midnight of December 31.
