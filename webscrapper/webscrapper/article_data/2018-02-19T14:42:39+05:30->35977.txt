COIMBATORE: The   (CPI) on Sunday threatened to file a contempt petition against Prime Minister   if the   verdict on   river water is not followed.

 Addressing a news conference, CPI leader D Pandian said that the Cauvery management board should be constituted by the Centre within the stipulated time. “Tamil Nadu is respecting the Supreme Court’s order on Cauvery water sharing and the Union government should respect the feelings of the people of the state. The Union government is in the position to constitute the Cauvery management board. If it fails to do so, then a contempt case will be filed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.
 
 “Modi is always talking about digital India and cashless transaction. He should take steps to install systems to monitor Cauvery water sharing and should appoint representatives for four states to monitor the water sharing,” Pandian said.
 
 If the SC verdict is not implemented, CPI will intensify protest against the Union government across the state, Pandian added. TNN
