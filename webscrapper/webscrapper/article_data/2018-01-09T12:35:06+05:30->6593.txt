KOZHIKODE: The reports that some of its former members from the state have joined the   ( ) came as a shock to   of India (PFI), according to an internal circular distributed among the   cadres.

 “Though the number is not very significant this happened in violation of our organizational teachings and it is a matter of serious concern,” said the circular, dated November 30, 2017, issued by the national chairman of the PFI, E Aboobacker, to be read and discussed at the unit meetings.
 
 Recalling an earlier circular against the IS issued on September 11, 2014, Aboobacker said, “Popular Front is an organization that identified the dangers inherent in IS in the early stage itself when news about the same started appearing in the media. Since then our organization has been instructing our members and the masses about the anti-religious and anti-national nature of IS.”
 
 He claimed that PFI had warned its cadres on “the possible attempts of IS recruitment on various occasions and through various means and alerting the members to be cautious about getting trapped in it.”
 
 The PFI chairman said that the organization had warned that its “members must be extremely cautious about the mysterious groups, their brainwashing efforts and their attempts of infiltration and precaution have to be taken during social media interventions.”
 
 The circular in 2014 had reminded the members that “if any organization member is found to be deviating from our organizational approach, the matter has to be brought to the notice of district and state leadership without any delay.”
 
 The new circular was issued after it became evident that at least 15 former PFI cadres, including a former divisional convener from  , had joined the IS despite these warnings.
