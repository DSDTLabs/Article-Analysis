AURANGABAD: The 42-year-old   printing and circulating   counterfeit currency has revealed that he came up with the idea in a bid to pay off his   into   

 The city police on May 19 arrested Majed aslias   Bismillah Khan (42), a resident of Indira Nagar, and seized 455 counterfeit notes, including 210 notes of Rs 2,000, 152 notes of Rs 500 and 93 notes of Rs 100. Khan, who has not even completed his schooling, printed   notes using printers, scanners and computer.
 
 Police said Khan is already a criminal on police record and facing case involving forgery charges. Investigations revealed that Mota Mujju aspired to become a corporator and in an attempt to win over the residents of his locality, he started spending money lavishly.
 
 After he ran out of money, he started borrowing from private money lenders. Deteriorating financial conditions forced Khan to take up plying auto-rickshaw in the city, but he still struggled to make both ends meet. It was after the private money lenders started pulling him up to recover the debts that he decided to find a way out to overcome the debt-web.
 
 An officer privy to the investigations said the accused has repaid loan of Rs 10 lakh, using the counterfeit notes in the past eight months. His sudden move to return money came as a surprise even to his close associates and family members.
 
 Jinsi police inspector   said, “The investigation has found that the accused has been into manufacturing and circulation of counterfeit currency notes for a good span of time.”
 
 The police have also found that the accused was spending lavishly on his supporters. He has even sold off his auto-rickshaw and is said to have been spending money earned from alleged illegitimate source. Even the ATS has questioned him in this case.
