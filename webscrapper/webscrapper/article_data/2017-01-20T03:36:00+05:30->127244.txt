MUMBAI: The Mumbai airport has suspended two officials for fraudulent recording of departure times of 22 flights in the past two months. 

 In a letter sent to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, a Mumbai International Airport Pvt ltd (MIAL) official said that departure time of 10 flights in December and 12 flights in November was recorded incorrectly and the two officials concerned were placed under suspension from January 16. The Mumbai airport handles about 13,000 departures a month.
 
 The letter doesn’t name the airlines whose arrival flight timings were wrongly recorded. An MIAL spokesperson said that the matter was under probe and so she couldn’t comment further.
 
 The Mumbai airport had turned into ground zero in the battle between airlines over their on-time performance (OTP) that is, flight schedule punctuality. Any flight whose arrival or departure is late by 15 minutes or more is deemed as a delayed flight.
