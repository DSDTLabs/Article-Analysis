KOHIMA: With the NDPP-BJP alliance all set to form the government in  , the big question that stares them in the face now is how the protracted Naga political problem will be resolved.

 The process to find a solution to the demand for a greater Nagaland by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), has been in the works for decades. Greater Nagaland, or Nagalim, encompasses Naga-dominated areas of Assam, Manipur and   besides Nagaland. This demand has been a bone of contention between Nagaland and its neighbours.
 
 The Centre took a huge step forward in peace talks by signing a Framework Agreement with   (I-M) in 2015. Last year, six other Naga national political groups (NNPGs) joined the peace process as well. The Centre has also been trying to get NSCN (Khaplang) to join the peace talks.
 
 PM   had also promised early solution during his campaign in the state. Political parties in the state, including  , know that BJP has to be involved in the government to make progress in the peace talks.
 
 BJP, on its part, wants to come out from being a “fringe player” in state politics and has also put high stakes in the peace talks so that it paves the way for a bigger role in Nagaland politics. Winning 11 seats in the state this time, from only one in 2013, has provided BJP the much-needed fillip to play its role in state politics.
