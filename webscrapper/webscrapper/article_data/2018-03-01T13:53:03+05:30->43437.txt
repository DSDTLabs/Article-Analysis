TRICHY: Though the district administration has opened 26 direct procurement centres for purchasing paddy grains from across the district heeding the demand of farmers, only 40 tonnes of grains have been procured so far. Better price for the fine quality of rice in open market and lethargic approach of TNCSC officials are attributed to the reason for poor procurement of paddy in   district, farmers alleged. 
 
 However, 62,000 tonnes of paddy has been procured in Nagapattinam and 75,000 tonnes from 520 DPCs against the target of 2 lakh tonnes in Thanjavur district. The   (TNCSC) opened 26 DPCs across Trichy district at various places to purchase samba paddy from the farmers raised from around 1.03 lakh acres. As per the new procurement price fixed by the state government, farmers would get Rs 1,660 including Rs 70 as increment for ‘A’ grade variety and Rs 1,550 including Rs 50 as increment price for common variety. For both varieties, the allowable moisture is fixed as 17 per cent. 
  
 The agriculture department had recommended to the farmers to use   – 49, TKM 13, NLR, Co R 50 and Trichy 3 varieties which are pest-resistant. However, most of the farmers cultivate Andhra Ponni due to better price despite official’s warning about false smut disease. Since even the private traders are ready to give Rs 1,780 to 1,810 per tonne, farmers prefer to sell their produce to them instead of DPCs, said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of  . 
  
 “There are no activities at these DPCs and we could not find any staff there. If the situation is so, who would go there to sell their produce? ” Veerasekaran asked. 
  
 However, senior officials from TNCSC in Trichy denied the allegations. They said they had deputed the required staff at all the centres. Since they expect more arrivals from Lalgudi area, at present they were concentrating more on the 11 centres opened in that block.
