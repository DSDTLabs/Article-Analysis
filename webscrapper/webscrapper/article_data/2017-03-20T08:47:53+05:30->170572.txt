LUCKNOW: What left crowd guessing at the swearing-in ceremony was an interaction where Prime Minister   was all ears to   when the SP founder walked up to him and whispered something in his hear as Modi nodded his head in affirmation. 

 All through the conversation, that lasted almost 10 seconds,   and waved at the gathering as chants of "Modi Modi" filled the air. Before this, Mulayam had walked up to Modi and shook hands once the swearing in ceremony concluded. As the two leaders exchanged pleasantries,   chief  , who was standing nearby called Akhilesh who walked up to them and shook hands with Modi after a "Namaste". The four of them talked and laughed before Modi went ahead to meet other dignitaries present on the stage including a host of union ministers and chief ministers from various states. All through the event, while Mulayam appeared more relaxed than Akhilesh.
 
 This was not the first time that Modi and Mulayam camaraderie had caught the media glare. In 2014, when Mulayam went to attend Narendra Modi's swearing in ceremony as took a seat in the back rows, BJP chief Amit Shah held his hand and brought him to the front rows. Later in February 2015, Mulayam invited Modi to attend the tilak ceremony of SP patriarch Mulayam's grand nephew and Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap in Saifai and the PM obliged. Mulayam had often described Modi as a self made man who was risen from the ranks while Modi in turn had lauded the SP founder as a seasoned politician.
