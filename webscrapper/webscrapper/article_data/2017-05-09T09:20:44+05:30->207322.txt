ALLAHABAD: Preparations are on in full swing to turn three   of the   (AU) into ' '. 

  The concept is not new on the campus as the university had tried implementing it in 2012, and had witnessed  . As many as 1,000 students, including girl occupants, sat on a   for over 30 hours. Even the then VC, Prof AK Singh, was held hostage for 30 hours at his office. The concept, protested by the hostellers, was practised every year till 1977. This is the reason AU hostels and those run by the trusts were free of illegal occupants, said AU PRO, Prof Harsh Kumar, adding that students would vacate the hostels after completion of the examinations. And, students who used to stay back, would shift to summer hostels. In due course of time, however, the concept vanished and illegal occupants continued staying put at the hostels, said Prof Harsh.
