NEW DELHI: In a first, the   ( ) has published a list of essential diagnostic tests which identifies the most needed examinations for diseases like Type-2 diabetes, HIV and tuberculosis.

 "An accurate diagnosis is the first step to getting effective treatment," WHO director-general Dr   said. "No one should suffer or die because of lack of diagnostic services, or because the right tests were not available."
 
 The move assumes significance as many developing countries have a list of essential medicines but this is for the first time that any health agency has recommended adoption of diagnostics as critical to prevention of premature deaths through early management of diseases. Of the 113 tests on the list, 58 are listed for detection and diagnosis of common conditions that can help screening and management of patients. The remaining 55 tests are designed for detection, diagnosis and monitoring of "priority" diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, Hepatitis-B and C, human papillomavirus and syphilis.
 
 Health experts say essential diagnostics are key to improving access to treatment and while the government has been working in the direction to make diagnostic facilities accessible and available to all, the WHO’s   is likely to serve as a reference for countries to update or develop their own list of essential diagnostics.
 
 "As treatment providers we have observed that essential diagnostics are key to improving access to treatment in HIV and viral hepatitis... WHO’s technical work in this area is welcome and is the first step in addressing this gap in public health and access to treatment," said Leena Menghaney of MSF’s access campaign.
 
 WHO assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, Mariangela Simao said "Our aim is to provide a tool that can be useful to all countries, to test and treat better, but also to use health funds more efficiently by concentrating on the truly essential tests."
