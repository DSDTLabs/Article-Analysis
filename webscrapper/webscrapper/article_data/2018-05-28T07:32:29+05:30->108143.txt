KOCHI: The number of passport holders, who apply for reissuance of new passport after deleting ECR (Emigration Check Required), has reduced at   regional passport office (RPO). Of the three lakh applicants in 2013, 12,905 applied for deleting ECR and reissuance of a new passport. In 2017, of the five lakh total passport applicants only 11,617 applied for the same.

 
 “The main reason is that with people opting for higher studies, the number passports issued with   has reduced. Most youths do not have ECR stamp on their passport. People who went abroad, especially to   countries in the 90s, came here for deleting ECR,” said regional passport officer  .
 
 As per the Emigration Act, 1983, emigration check required (ECR) category of Indian passport holders, require emigration clearance from the office of the protector of emigrants (POE), ministry of overseas Indian affairs to visit 18 countries.
 
 However, the ministry (emigration policy division) has allowed ECR passport holders to travel abroad for purposes others than employment on production of a valid passport, valid visa and return ticket at the immigration counters at international airports in India.
 
 ECRis not requiredif a person has passed Class X and pays regular  . Otherwise, they have to stay abroad for over three years (the period could be one stretch or broken).
 
 “Earlier, people used to forget the number of years they stayed abroad or their educational qualifications to avoid emigration clearance. But after we started taking strict action, including registering FIR, such instances have reduced,” said Chandran.
 
 “Also, we have noticed that many of them who had ECR stamp on their passport have re-appeared for Class X exams and come to us for re-issuance of passport without ECR,” added Chandran.
