Coimbatore: Online marketplace Amazon India would expand its ‘I have space’ program across the country by adding thousands of store owners for delivering packages, a senior official said. 

 The program now covers about 12500 stores across 180 cities, including 1,000 in Tamil Nadu and 50 in Coimbatore. 
 
 The channel handles a significant proportion of Amazon Logistics’ volumes in cities where it is present, Amazon India spokesperson Ashwini Samraj said. 
 
 The larger expansion would happen during the Diwali season when sales volumes on Amazon would be high, she said
 
 Under the program, Amazon India partners with local store owners to provide pickup and delivery services to customers across different cities within a 2-4 km radius of their store. 
 
 The company has enabled store owners to supplement their regular income and generate more footballs in their stores, Ashwini said. 
 
 The program that started with 2,500 stores in 2015 has grown to 12,500 now.
 
 Store partners deliver between 30-40 packages a day, earning a fixed amount per delivery under the program which is open to all store owners who have the ability to service on foot or a two-wheeler. 
 
 “The only requirement to be an ‘I have space partner’ is for the store owner to have sufficient manpower to make local deliveries during their off-peak hours and space for storage of the packages,” Amazon India said. 
 
 Currently, the program primarily consists of grocery, telecom, stationery, chemists, general stores and other modern trade outlets.
