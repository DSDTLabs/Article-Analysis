The real estate regulator plans to crackdown on unauthorized construction. "The authorities concerned have assured us that they would report cases of unauthorized constructions to the respective collector. The developers not registering with the authority will face action under the Act," said a   ( ) official. 

  The regulator will adopt a stringent monitoring system to ensure that 88% of the 16,300 projects registered with it are completed by 2022.
 
 MahaRERA secretary   spoke to TOI on Monday, a day before the regulator turns one year old. 
 
 On the way forward, Prabhu said the authority will focus on districts with project registrations in single digits, such as Gadchiroli, Beed and Hingoli. "We will conduct awareness programmes among developers in these areas and ensure that more number of ongoing projects are registered with the MahaRERA," Prabhu said.
 
 MahaRERA, among the many firsts, has started a conciliation forum, which is a platform formed by the members of the   and developer bodies, such as Credai. Presently there are conciliation benches in Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur.
