BENGALURU: Defending the move to give tickets to brothers and associates of tainted mining baron G  , BJP national president   on Friday claimed his party had fielded them only because they had no cases pending against them.

 
 Participating as the guest of honour at the day-long   Now conclave organized by   and Vijay Karnataka, Shah said they had not given the tickets at the instance of Janardhana, and did so only after verifying that they had no pending cases against them.
 
 “How can anyone deny a ticket to a person just because he or she is the relative of an accused? Our candidates have no cases against them. So, you cannot draw parallel with our stand on Robert Vadra (son-in-law of Congress party president Sonia Gandhi and husband of  ) as he still has many cases pending against him,’’ Shah said.
 
 Interestingly, the affidavit of G Somashekara Reddy, the younger brother of Janardhana contesting on a BJP ticket from Ballari city, reveals that he has five cases pending against him - three in Ballari, one each in Hyderabad and Bengaluru courts.
 
 The BJP chief also claimed that they had not given tickets based on anyone’s religion, but had gone purely on the basis of merit and their contribution to the party.
 
 Accusing the Congress government of minority appeasement, Shah said, they will ban   and the Popular Front of India (PFI), organisations that he alleged were behind the murders of BJP and RSS workers in the state, if the BJP came to power.
