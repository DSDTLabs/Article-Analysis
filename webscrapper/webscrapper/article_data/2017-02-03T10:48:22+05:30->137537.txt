NAGPUR: The district and additional sessions judge OP Jaiswal on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail application of two accused involved in killing of Khapa tigress and two sambars.

 The two accused,   (46), Temburdoh, and Devidas Boriwar (40), Maharkund, both contract farmers, are absconding since the day of incident on January 13, when a full-grown tigress and two sambars were electrocuted in their farm on Surewani road near Maharkund.
 
 The Nagpur forest officials have registered a primary offence report (POR) against the accused under various sections of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 but there is no arrest owing to lax probe by Khapa range forest officer (RFO)  .
 
 Nagpur deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) G Mallikarjuna has already issued show-cause notice to Tagde for negligence in the case last week.
 
 When the officials learnt about anticipatory bail, forest department’s law officer Kavita Bhongde, district government pleader (DGP)  , assistant government pleaders (AGPs) Aasawari Parsodkar and   made a strong case. Though the accused pleaded not guilty, prosecution argued that unless the accused are arrested it will be difficult to make progress in investigations and know about the modus operandi.
 
 Both the accused had illegally flown electric current from 11kv line passing through the farm. When the accused found a tigress and two sambars dead, they dumped one sambar on the road to divert attention of officials. The spot is close to Mansinghdeo Wildlife Sanctuary and this may be a regular practice.
 
 However, forest department could track the dead tigress with the help of dog squad. The accused were making attempt to destroy evidence by burying the tigress. They had also chopped skull of the sambar and had dig a pit in one corner of the farm.
 
 Forest department sources said the accused may move the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court for seeking bail. “We are well prepared and will nail them,” said officials.
