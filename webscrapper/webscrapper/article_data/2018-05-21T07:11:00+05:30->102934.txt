GURUGRAM:   officials demolished an unauthorised boundary wall in   village that was obstructing the way to four Huda plots and had encroached upon two more plots owned by the authority.

 The villager who had encroached on the plots owns an adjoining 300sq-yard-plot. 
 
 He had, however, built a boundary wall around 475 sq yards of land, encroaching on around 175sq yards falling in two Huda plots nearby his own and blocking the thoroughfare to another four plots in the process. 
 
 Notably, during the acquisition of land in the area by Huda, the plot owner had been awarded relief from the Punjab and Haryana high court stating his land couldn’t be acquired by Huda. 
 
 A team of six Huda officials and 15 cops demolished the wall on Saturday. 
 
 A duty magistrate was also appointed by the district administration to avoid any untoward situation. 
 
 “We had received multiple complaints in this regard from other plot owners who had been affected by this unauthorised wall. The brick wall has now been demolished by our team, and the encroachment has been removed,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer 2, Huda.
