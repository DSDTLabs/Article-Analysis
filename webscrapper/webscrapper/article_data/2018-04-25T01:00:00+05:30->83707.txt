Ileana D’Cruz, who has been working in the 
  industry as a leading lady for more than a decade, has strong views on  . She spoke with her trademark frankness when asked, if women were truly empowered in the film industry. She said, “I don’t think a movement, silent protests and banners will magically empower women. What really needs to change is the mindset. People have to change the way they think about women. I saw a commercial where a woman was being harassed under the pretext of masti. It’s weird that such things are considered normal. Millions of people need to change the way they think about these things. In fact, I was watching a song from a film that I was offered but I didn’t end up doing. The depiction was crass to say the least, because of the way the woman was being grabbed. She is not a piece of meat. It’s not surprising that films like these do well because the mindset is like that. As far as roles in films for women are concerned, it is changing. Women put their foot down now and say that, ‘I am not going to do it’ especially when they are uncomfortable with the portrayal. Since they have started doing that, filmmakers have had to re-think the kind of roles they write and offer to women.”
