ULHASNAGAR:   candidate Dimple Thakur has been served a notice by the state election commission for allegedly violating poll norms by using her father’s picture and name on campaign posters and banners in Ulhasnagar. 

 Sources said Dimple is trying to pass off her father, Narendra Thakur, as a candidate to influence voters. Dimple is contesting poll from panel number 9-A where from Narendra had won elections for the last two terms. However, since the seat was reserved for a woman candidate this time around, Narendra fielded Dimple as a candidate. The EC served the notice after Dimple’s rival from SAI Party complained about the use of Narendra’s photo and name instead of Dimple’s in the publicity material.
