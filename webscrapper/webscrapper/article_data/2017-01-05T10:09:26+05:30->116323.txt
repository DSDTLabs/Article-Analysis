SURAT: The state government and   (SMC) are propagating hard for  , but when it comes to dealing with beneficiaries of housing scheme for poor, government asks them to come with Rs 10,000 in cash for registration of the documents.

  of Surat, went to get his register his friend’s a few days ago and he was asked to come with Rs 10,000 in cash on Monday for registration of EWS (economically weaker sections) quarters by the clerk of property registrar’s office. They explained that they did not have any other means of accepting money. 
 
 “How can a poor man get Rs 10,000 cash when nobody has cash on hand? They must also adopt other means of accepting money,” said Jotania. 
 
 However, district collector,   said, “This problem is not limited to Surat. It is a state-wide issue. Government has to decide on who will bear the expenses if money is paid by credit/debit cards or by other means. Unless that decision is taken by state government, we can at the most instruct property registrar’s office to accept payment in demand draft.”
