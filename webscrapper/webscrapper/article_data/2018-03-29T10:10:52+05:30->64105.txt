AHMEDABAD: The   re-test shock, that the   and   will be conducted again robbed students of their happiness and relief that the exams had ended, and a volcano of anger mixed with despair erupted. 

 The agitation was such that Gujarat education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama was flooded by calls from anxious parents which prompted him to call HRD minister Prakash Javadekar, urging him to spare students here the retest and limit the fresh exam only to regions impacted by the paper leak.
 
  
  “I got a large number of calls from anxious and agitated students following which I called HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. I requested him that if the paper had leaked in Delhi, then students of the entire country need not be punished. It would be more prudent if the retest is conducted only in regions impacted by paper leak. There has been no instance of paper leak in Gujarat,” Chudasama said.
 
 Chudasama added, “Javdekar said that a meeting with CBSE and other top officials has been convened on Thursday and a decision will be taken then.”
 
 Meanwhile, student and parents of CBSE board students were crestfallen. “The re-examination is an extremely disappointing development. I am very disturbed. My paper went well and our family was headed to the UAE for a vacation on April 4. It will have to be cancelled now. I fear that my retest will not be as good as my earlier performance, as it seems impossible to study again,” said Anay Nanavati, a class X student. 
 
 “My daughter is very upset and is not in favour of giving a re-test. All our vacation plans will also have to be cancelled,” said Rudy Prince, the parent of a class X student.
 
 In fact, many students and parents were signing petitions against the re-examination by the CBSE and insisted that the re-test be held only in regions where the paper leak had happened.
