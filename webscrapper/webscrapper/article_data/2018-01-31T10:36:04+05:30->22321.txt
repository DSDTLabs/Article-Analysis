KOLKATA: Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has resented infringement on privacy of citizens, echoing the views of petitioners challenging the central law and rules making   linkage mandatory to a host of individual possessions such as bank accounts, phone numbers and PAN.

 While reading out the Governor’s speech in the   Assembly Budget Session on Tuesday, the governor stopped short of mentioning Aadhaar as it is a subjudice matter, but said: “My government led by my dynamic chief minister strongly believes in individual freedom and strongly resents any infringement on individual freedom or any compromise with the sanctity of the privacy of citizens.” The statement is in sync with chief minister   taking on the   government the other day when the CM went to the extent of saying that she would surrender her phone if the service provider insisted on Aadhaar linkage.
 
 Strange it may sound that the view came from Keshari Nath Tripathi, but the opposition didn’t take it as Tripathi’s personal view but as the government’s stand. “It’s true that the governor is the head of the state. But he has to read out the speech prepared by the state government. The governor can send back certain portions of the speech for review but can’t change it,” leader of the opposition   said. Mannan recalled a case during the second United   government in 1969. “Governor   had dissolved the first United Front government. But when the second United Front government came to office, the same governor had to condemn his own act while reading out the governor’s speech because the government wanted so. Dharma Vira had suggested changes in few words in the speech but that didn’t find favour with the government,” Mannan said.
 
 Going with the logic, Tripathi’s clean chit to his government over maintaining peace and tranquillity in the state didn’t seem at odds with the governor-CM spat over the Basirhat flare-up, six months ago in July 2017.
