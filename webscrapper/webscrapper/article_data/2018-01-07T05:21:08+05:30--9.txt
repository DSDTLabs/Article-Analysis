NEW DELHI/GURGAON: Saturday was the   day so far this winter in the capital and Gurgaon as the mercury dived under the 5 degrees Celsius mark in both cities. Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 4.2 degrees Celsius. Gurgaon was colder at just 4 degrees Celsius.

 Officials at the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) Delhi told TOI clear skies and northerly winds from Jammu and Kashmir pushed the mercury down a notch from the 5-6 degrees mark it was hovering around over the last couple of days.
 
 The weathermen said there was “no unusual weather activity at all”, and that wind speed was likely to pick up further, causing the blanket of fog lingering over the region to dissipate. “Due to the clear skies and brisk wind speed, the temperature dipped. We are likely to see colder days where the minimum will stay at 4 degrees Celsius average. We will continue to see foggy conditions but it will be shallow,” said an official at RFWC.
 
 
  
  
 
 The new week is likely to begin on an even chillier note with the minimum temperature expected to fall to 3 degrees Celsius.
 
 In parts of Delhi, Saturday morning visibility fell to as low as 50 metres. By noon, however, there was a significant improvement to over 1,000 metres. The fall in mercury also resulted in a spike in the pollution levels with Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) touching “severe” with an index of 404 – the second time this week. Gurgaon’s AQI was a shade better at 355, but still in the ‘very poor’ category. Ghaziabad, though, was the most polluted place in NCR with an AQI of 480, which is classified as ‘severe’.
 
 D Saha, head of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory said the deterioration in air quality was due to the drop in temperatures and an increase in humidity levels. “Air quality will stay similar in the next few days and it may even deteriorate by 5-10%,” said Saha.
