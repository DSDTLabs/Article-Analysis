Mumbai: The BJP is firm on extracting 115 of the total 227   seats from its ally, the  . The BJP's tough stance may derail the seat sharing talks between the two saffron parties ahead of the Mumbai civic elections. Both parties are gearing up to go their separate ways should talks fail, sources said. 

 In support of its claim, the BJP cites the 2014 state assembly election results in Mumbai. "In the 2014 assembly elections, the BJP was No. 1 in 115 civic wards in Mumbai. By this logic there is no plausible reason for us to settle for anything less than 115 municipal wards for the upcoming BMC elections," said a senior BJP leader on Monday, hours before the BJP-Sena's first round of formal talks.
 
 Key BJP leaders, including Raosaheb Danve, Ashish Shelar, ministers Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, MLA, held talks with Sena functionaries Anil Desai, MP, Anil Parab and Ravindra Mirlekar. Shelar told mediapersons, "We did not discuss numbers. We are trying to evolve a consensus and have a deadline of January 21 to decide on the alliance. The final decision will be taken by CM Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray."
 
 Apart from the number game, selection of wards will be a thorny issue. "The BJP has set its eyes on Marathi-dominated wards in order to cut the Sena to size in the civic elections," he said.
