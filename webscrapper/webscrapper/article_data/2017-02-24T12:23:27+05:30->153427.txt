 is delighted that after ' ', which bagged the 1992 National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, his directorial debut, ' ', will now be digitally restored by the NFDC.

 The process is underway with the 16 mm film being re-synced, and Sudhir, along with movie connoisseurs, is looking forward to revisiting the film, which had won him the   Award for Best First Film of a Director.
 
  
  
 He was just 27 when he shot the film over 40 days in his hometown Lucknow with family and friends, and even his actors, many of them drawn from the local theatre, pitching in. The trigger was a   remark that the reason 75,000 Europeans could rule over 20 crore Indians was because some collaborated with them. It led to a story of student activism, of betrayal by comrades and conscience, as memories resurface when a trio is confronted by political skirmishes which mar the centenary celebrations of their school for which they have returned to Rajpur. 
 
 "Many believe I started my career with 'Dharavi'. But Javed saab (lyricist-scriptwriter   ) and I became friends because he liked 'Yeh Woh Manzil To Nahin'. He's often told me I should remake it because the story is still relevant," informs Sudhir, admitting that restoring it is better than remaking because he won't be able to replicate how he thought back then when he was a young, angry and somewhat na√Øve 27-year-old director. "This way the film remains the way it was with only the technical quality enhanced, giving it a new lease of life on TV, DVD and digital."
 
 There's a third film to be restored, ' ' (1988), and, according to Sudhir, is Deepti Naval's best performance.
