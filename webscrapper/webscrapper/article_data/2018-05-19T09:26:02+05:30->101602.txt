KOLKATA: The traffic management plan on Rajarhat Expressway will be changed near the   bus stand from Saturday to facilitate construction of a   station on the New Garia-Airport route. With the Salt Lake-bound flank of Rajarhat Expressway blocked for around 300m to allow construction of the “Bidhan Nagar” station, cops will ask motorists driving into the city to turn left at the base of the flyover in front of Axis Mall and drive towards Nazrul Tirtha using the service lane and roads running through the township.

 
  
 
 “The vehicles coming from   towards the city will take a left from Axis Mall crossing by following Street Nos. 240, 175 and 24,” said Amit Jawalgi, the deputy commissioner (headquarter) of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.
 
 Vehicles coming from the New Town bus stand towards the city and the cars heading towards the airport can travel along usual routes. The airportbound traffic has been offered an additional route through the township — they can turn left around 70m ahead of the New Town bus stand and drive straight down Street No. 70 till 50m ahead of Utsa Garden housing complex. At that point, they have to turn right and move towards Pride Hotel, from where they can get back on the Rajarhat Expressway.
 
 “The airport-bound main carriageway will remain open all the time and there are two more substitute roads available to reach Axis Mall and the BSNL office — along the service road and along bylanes of the township through Street Nos. 24, 106, and 175,” said Jawalgi.
