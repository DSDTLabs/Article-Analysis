 MOHALI: Out of the 20 Mohali  , 15 are from one school — Senior Secondary Residential School for Meritorious Students, Sector 70, Mohali. And, out of these 15, 14 are girls.
 
 Shivani, a non-medical student who topped in Mohali district with 94.4% and Aarti, who scored 94% and stood second, belong to the same school. Shivani’s father works as a compounder in a government hospital, while Aarti’s father is a daily-wage worker.
 
 The school was established in 2014 in Mohali along with other districts of the state and is meant for poor but brilliant students.
 
 Talking to TOI,   of Anandpur Sahib said, “I am feeling delighted after hearing the news that I have topped the exam in district. I had studied regularly throughout the session. I appeared for the IIT-JEE as well as PUCET exam. I have an aspiration to become an engineer. My mother always inspired me. I had never taken pressure of board exams”.
 
 Aarti, another student from the same school, said, “I had never thought that I would get second position in the district in board exams. My mother is a housewife. I had scored 95 marks in Class X board exams. To achieve this position, I had studied throughout the night. I am determined that I would change my family’s condition by my hard work. I have two siblings, my brother and sister, studying in Hindi medium. Today, I am feeling awesome as I fulfilled the dream of my parents.”
 
 “I want to become a teacher, so that I can provide quality of education to the poor and needy students,” Aarti said.
 
 Kuldeep Singh, principal, said 14 students from economically weaker background from this school cracked JEE mains last year. Teachers have hoped that many of their students would crack IIT-JEE as well as NEET exam this time also.
 
 In meritorious school at Mohali, only students from science and commerce streams get a chance to study.
