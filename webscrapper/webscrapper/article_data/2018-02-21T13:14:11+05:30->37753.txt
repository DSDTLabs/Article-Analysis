Subrahmanya: Ill-health almost derailed   president Amit Shah’s visit to Dakshina Kannada, where he launched the party’s Navashakti conventions for the state, in the run up to assembly elections, at this pilgrimage centre on Tuesday. 

 While a bout of   kept him from addressing party workers outside   at Kenjar on Monday, Shah felt its after-effects even on Tuesday, which delayed his schedule for the day, exactly by an hour.
 
 Shah, who was supposed to address the first of the Navashakti conventions at a nearby private ground at Kulkunda at 9am, left for Kukke Sri Subrahmanya Temple at 9.03am where he had darshan of the presiding deity and later met Sri Vidyaprasanna Teertha, seer of Samputa Narasimha Math. He then returned to the VVIP Adishesha guest house of the temple at 9.32am, changed his dress, and then left for the grounds. He reached the grounds at 10.30 am, 90 minutes behind schedule.
 
 Government physicians who attended to Shah at the guest house, said the BJP chief was clearly feeling the effects of fever, but had come prepared with his own medications, which his personal aide administered to him. Shah had breakfast of uppittu, kesari bath and idli vada with black coffee. He also tucked into idli sambar, thanking Satish Bhat and the staff of Hotel Kumara Krupa, who prepared it for him. He was particularly appreciative of the drumstick sambar.
 
 However, once at Kulkunda, Shah got into campaign mode, and appeared none the worse for the fever that kept him down the previous day, and early through the day. Taking medicines given to him by his aide on stage, Shah in the course of his 30-minute speech, inspired the Navashakti office-bearers and highlighted failures of the state government. His in-camera Q and A session post his address to students at Puttur, started at 12.15pm against the scheduled time of 10.30 am.
