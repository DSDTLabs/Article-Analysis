GURUGRAM: The   have made yet another trial diversion at the ‘Z Chowk’ near Huda City Centre   station, which is a major choke point.

 The latest change is for commuters coming from Iffco Chowk side or from the Wazirabad/Ardee City side. 
 
 For traffic heading towards the Metro station, the right turn at ‘Z Chowk’ has been closed for the trial period. The trial started on Tuesday morning, and several commuters who were unaware of the turn, had to make adjustments to their routes on the way to work.
 
 DCP (traffic) Simardeep Singh, speaking to TOI on Tuesday evening, said traffic gets choked at the chowk, as there is only one lane to pass, with all other lanes blocked. This increases wait time at the junction. “With this change, the wait time will reduce considerably,” he said.
 
 For commuters approaching from the Ardee City/Wazirabad side, the right turn going towards Golf Course Road will also be closed down. To cross the chowk and reach the other side, vehicles will have to cross the red light and take a U-turn near Max Hospital.
 
 Singh said he visited the site on Tuesday morning to observe the situation and got a positive response from people. “We’re going to take more feedback from commuters and decide whether this diversion is to be made permanent,” he said.
 
 When TOI asked Singh if the space for the U-turn will pose a hurdle for longer vehicles to take the turn, he said police will take the issue up with Huda and MCG as and when they decide upon making it permanent. “We’ll meet and talk about widening the U-turn if after Friday, it is decided to be kept permanently,” he said.
 
 However, some commuters were unhappy with the change. One of the tweets responding to the new diversion read, “It seems to be causing way more nuisance than normal, especially with the annoying signal near Iffco Chowk.”
