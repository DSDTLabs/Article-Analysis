BHUBANESWAR: Odisha police have objected to construction of bitumen approach roads to the   bridge, which is nearing completion in Maoist-hit   district. Instead, police want concrete approach roads because rebels can easily plant improvised explosive devices (IEDs) targeting security forces in bitumen roads. 

 Additional director general (operations) R P Koche in a letter to works secretary   stated that the Maoist groups operating in the area are opposing construction of the bridge and might target it in the future. Recently, the district administration installed   cameras at different locations near the bridge to prevent any damage to it by Maoists.
 
 A senior official in the works department said though it has taken note of the proposal made by the police for bitumen approach roads, it may not construct concrete roads immediately. "Since the initial design was for bitumen approach roads, the executing agency has already completed construction. We will plan for concrete roads in the future," the official said requesting anonymity.
 
 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik would dedicate the bridge to the public in June. Construction of the 910-metre bridge was carried out amid thick security by police and paramilitary forces. At least five BSF camps have been set up between Chitrakonda and Janbai for the purpose.
 
 Though foundation of the bridge was laid in 1982 by the then chief minister   and again by chief minister Naveen Patnaik in 2000, the construction activities could not be taken up over the years due to intense protest by the Left-wing extremists. The bridge would provide connectivity to around 151 villages spread over seven panchayats in the cut-off areas of Malkangiri district.
