Karwar: A stag, which strayed into   area in   city on Monday, was saved by some people after it leapt into the sea in a bid to escape. It is suspected that the   was in search of water as there is acute shortage in some parts of the Western Ghats. Some morning walkers spotted the stag first near NH-66, around 6am. They tried to rescue the animal as   were chasing it. The panicky stag, said to be around two years old, reportedly ran towards the sea. It swam for more than 10 minutes until citizens caught hold of the animal with help from fishermen.

 Forest officials shifted the stag to their nursery in Karwar. “Stags suffer a heart attack when they come in contact with human beings and also when attacked by other animals. Fortunately, this stag did not have any problem when it was caught,” said an official. “Once it is out of shock, it will be released in the forest where abundant water is available,” said   officials.
