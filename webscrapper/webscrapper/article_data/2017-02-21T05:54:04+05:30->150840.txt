BENGALURU: If everything goes as planned by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), residents of west Bengaluru will soon get a solution to their connectivity issues. The proposed 11-km   connecting Rajajinagar 1st Block to Gollarahatti, off NICE Road, is expected to decongest the area. 

 The flyover, estimated to cost Rs 90 crore, will connect Rajajinagar and surrounding areas to   as well as to NICE peripheral road so that exit towards Mysuru, Tumakuru and Magadi will be a smooth affair.
 
 Mayor   said the BBMP will construct a portion of the flyover from Bovipalya to   located close to ORR. “The remaining part from Sumanahalli point of ORR up to Gollarahatti, off NICE Road, will be built using local area development grants of legislatiors and MPs,” she added.
 
 The mayor along with Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh, Rajarajeshwari Nagar MLA Munirathna Naidu and Mahalakshmi Layout MLA K Gopalaiah undertook an inspection of the proposed corridor on Monday.
 
 The mayor claimed that no trees will be cut or park space will be used for the project. “A detailed plan in this regard is getting ready. The same will be announced in the BBMP budget as well as the state budget,” she added.
 
 However, B Bhadregowda, chairman, BBMP ward-level works standing committee, who was part of the inspection team, said they may not go for a flyover for the stretch between Bovipalya and Kamalanagar. 
 
 “We have suggested to widen the existing road and facilitate smooth traffic flow till the ring road. A final decision will be taken after the monthly council meeting in the last week of this month,” he added.
