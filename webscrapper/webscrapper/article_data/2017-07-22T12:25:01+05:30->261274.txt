 Muzaffarpur   attributed the clash to an old dispute over the immovable properties of   between its board members and Kazim.
 
 “Kazim had issued a fatwa last Friday, saying the properties of the waqf board would be locked by his supporters on July 21. In view of this, police personnel had been deployed in the area,” the SSP said, adding 14 cases were already pending against Kazim and even an arrest warrant was pending to be executed against him.
 
 Kazim along with supporters allegedly tried to lock the shops and other buildings in the area, but the administration stopped them even as another group of locals assembled to oppose Kazim.
 
 “In the ensuing violence between the two groups, Kazim’s women supporters sprayed pepper powder on the faces of policemen, including DSP Anand,” the SSP said and added Kazim was later arrested.
 
 According to SDO Kumar, the waqf board owns three bighas of land. “At least   were also exchanged between the two groups,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Kazim’s family member Ghaznafar Raza said Kazim’s wife Runi Kazim had her limb fractured in police lathicharge. “Instead of doing welfare work, the waqf board was selling its assets. Kazim would oppose it and had also called upon people not to pay rent to the waqf board,” Raza told TOI over the phone.
