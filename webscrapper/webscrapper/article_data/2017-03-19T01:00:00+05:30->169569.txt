One of the highlights of the recent Royal Stag   was when   and   took to the stage. The audience went hysteric as Anushka rapped live for the peppy number 'Naughty Billo' from her upcoming romantic film,  . Diljit, who is a popular singer and actor, sang the song along with Anushka, much to the delight of the audiences, who cheered them on. 
Anushka said, “I was very scared because to rap, you need to have that swag in you and I was actually dying thinking about it. But I am happy to see that people have loved the song and my 
 rapping, which I have done for the first time.” 
 
 Diljit was full of praise for her rapping skills and said, “She is not only an actor and producer, she has now shown she can rap as well. She is an all-out performer!” 'Phillauri' releases on March 24 and the music is by T-Series.
 
 The audience at Mirchi Music Awards was among the first to watch the duo perform the number live. Catch this and other power-packed performances at the Royal Stag Mirchi Music Awards tonight at 8 pm on Zee TV.
