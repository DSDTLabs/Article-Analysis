MUMBAI: Being the hosts of the tournament is tough because of the weight of expectations of playing in your own backyard. With 90 days to go for the  , the Indian team surely must be feeling such kind of pressure, especially knowing they'll be the first Indian team to participate in a   tournament.

 India's group opponent though, seems to think otherwise. Orlando  , the coach of Colombia, who are in the same pool as the hosts, said it's actually pressure on the opponents. "Playing the host nation will be more difficult because there will be a lot of focus on us. If we were any team then there wouldn't be as much pressure. It's a big responsibility too. The crowd will be against us. More importantly, the host nation is always the most charged up so it will be difficult, but I'm sure that we will do well," he told TOI on the sidelines of the draw ceremony here.
 
 Another challenge that his team faces is acclimatising itself to the hot and humid conditions of Mumbai. "We plan to play in places like Dubai and some European countries that have similar conditions. So yes, hopefully we will be prepared to face the weather," he said.
 
 "Our Colombian teams are good for practise. So we will be totally prepared," he said.
