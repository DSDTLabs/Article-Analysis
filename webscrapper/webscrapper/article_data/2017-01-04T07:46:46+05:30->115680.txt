KOLKATA: Civic bosses in Kolkata and Bidhannagar seem to have been nudged out of their slumber by the National Consumer Forum’s order that accepted a   as “an accident” and directed an insurance firm to pay up.

 Having decided to intensify the civic body’s drive against   and dengue, KMC health department bosses plan to open three more dengue detection centres and launch a citywide awareness campaign against malaria and dengue from January 7. “We plan to offer treatment for malaria and dengue in all the 144 city wards. The additional dengue detection centres will enhance the infrastructure to tackle the situation if crisis arises,” said Atin Ghosh, member, mayor-in-council, overseeing the civic health department. The KMC will also strengthen its rapid action force (RAF) team, in charge of prevention of malaria and dengue. The civic body may tie up with insurance firms for round-the-year prevention drives. “If need be , we will approach the insurance firms for a tie-up,” Ghosh said. 
 
 Taking lesson from last year’s dengue onslaught, in which nine people—including a nine-year-old boy—died in   and Rajarhat, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation have decided to develop the existing facilities in advance to ensure the disease is kept in check.
 
 Bidhannagar corporation MMiC (health) Pranay Roy said anti-malaria and anti-dengue drives would begin from February-end, to be fully prepared before the onset of monsoon, when the disease spreads its wings. “We will increase the number of civic workers in the area. Action will be taken to keep all neighbourhoods clean, clear undergrowth and stop water from accumulating,” Roy said. “The civic body also plans a mass awareness campaign through talk shows, short films, pamphlets and hoardings.” He added there would be separate vector-borne control units, along with special fever clinics and health camps, where blood test samples would be collected and tested at Matri Sadan hospital in Salt Lake.
