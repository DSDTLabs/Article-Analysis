DUMKA:   and JMM working president   on Monday accused the state government of going beyond its jurisdiction to introduce the amendments in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and   (SPT) laws. 

 Addressing a press conference at his Khijuria-based residence, Soren said, "The state government does not have the power to tamper with the tenancy laws and JMM is seriously considering to go to the court to nullify the amendments." Soren's remarks comes a day before the commencement of the budget session of the state assembly.
 
 Soren said the legal option to challenge the amendments in the tenancy laws was open. He added that JMM functionaries of all the six districts of Santhal Pargana were directed to ensure maximum opposition from people on   Diwas programme to protest the, what he termed as, 'anti-state' policies of the state government.
 
 The JMM leader further alleged the central government was hand in glove with the state government and has taken a casual approach on the issue which has threatened the existence of the tribals. He also said the BJP was itself is a divided house on the issue as party MLAs came forward to oppose it on several occassions.
 
 The divisional level party meet was attended by all party MLAs and Rajmahal MP  , apart from functionaries of respective district units.
 
 Soren conducted a divisional-level meeting earlier during the day, to discuss preparations for the annual Jharkhand Diwas programme, traditionally organized at Gandhi Maidan Dumka on February 2 every year, to mark the party's establishment day.
