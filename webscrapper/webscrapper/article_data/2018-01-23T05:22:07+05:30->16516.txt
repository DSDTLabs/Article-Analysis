Actress   said she doesn't need to do anything to achieve her full, evenly-arched brows and she never "touches" them.

 
  
 "My only tip is that I don't touch my eyebrows. I don't wax them. I don't touch them at all... I get them from my grandmother, and my grandmother doesn't do anything to her   either," Fanning said on the red carpet of 24th  .
 
 The   actress walked the red carpet in a blush pink gown, and opted for barely-there nude make-up, with peach eyeshadow accented by a glittery pale pink on the inner corners and lids, while her cheeks and lips were also flesh-toned pink.
