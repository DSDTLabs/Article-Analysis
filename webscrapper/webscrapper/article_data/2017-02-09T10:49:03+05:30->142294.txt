CHENNAI: A day after alleging that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa was poisoned by   general secretary V K Sasikala and her family, former assembly speaker and a founding member of the AIADMK P H Pandian claimed that Dr K S Sivakumar, a personal physician of Jayalalithaa and a close relative of Sasikala, had administered a wrong medicine for diabetes and this complicated the condition of the former chief minister, leading to her death. 

 “By evening Sasikala and her family will be exposed, as a private TV channel will air a programme accusing Dr Sivakumar of administering a wrong injection to treat Jayalalithaa for diabetes,” said Pandian. 
 
 The AIADMK stalwart vented his anger on Sasikala and her family members once again on Wednesday. “Sasikala and her family are only after money. Due to this they have either sidelined or sent out many senior leaders of the party. Now, after Jayalalithaa’ death, they want to capture power and add to their wealth,” said Pandian. 
 
 Accusing the AIADMK general secretary of amassing wealth through liquor manufacture, Pandian said, “annually, Sasikala and family earn a total revenue of Rs 17,000 crore from the liquor company Midas. Do we need a general secretary who earns in crores when cadres are in a hand-to-mouth situation?” 
 
 He threatened to file a first information report on the ‘atrocities’ committed by Sasikala and her family members.
