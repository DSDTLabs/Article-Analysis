KOLHAPUR: Citizens felt let down by Saturday's budget as no new projects were announced to boost   and the tourism potential. 

 The only   mention in the budget refers to the approval of developing the Jotiba Temple. Expectations were high as the public hoped for the sanction of substantial funds for pending and proposed projects. Several plans were on the cards for the last few years, most concerned with river pollution and the Mahalaxmi Temple.
 
  MLA, Rajesh Kshirsagar, said, "We were hopeful that the state would give approval to develop the Mahalaxmi temple as the plan was discussed several times with the ministers. The state kept aside over Rs 900 crore for the Mula Mutha rivers. But, the equally polluted Panchganga was not given a single penny." 
 
 The state recently sanctioned Rs 72 crore to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( ) to undertake the work to lay an underground drainage network, but the amount is yet to be released. The budget mentioned several infrastructure projects to be undertaken under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. The state has made a Rs 1,870-crore provision under the Amrut mission in 44 cities in the state for issues like water supply, sewage and urban transport.
 
  Congress MLC Satej Patil, said, "When I was minister, we got funds sanctioned for projects such as water supply, road construction, revamping heritage sites, developing lakes and sewage treatment plants. We expected funds for projects such as construction of Shahu Memorial, airport development and a circuit bench for the Bombay high court. Chandrakant Patil is second in rank in the state. But, his influence hardly helped the citizens."
