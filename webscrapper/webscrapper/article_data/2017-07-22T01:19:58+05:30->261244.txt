MUMBAI: All   have been cleared from Tardeo, Andheri, Borivli and Wadala   and only   in possession of ‘authority letters’ from transport agencies were allowed to operate on Friday, said RTO officials. 

 Transport commissioner Praveen Gedam had issued directives to make all RTOs free of touts. “According to an HC directive, if agents have   from either transport agencies or state transport undertakings or private contractors , we cannot stop them from entering our premises,” said a senior RTO official.
