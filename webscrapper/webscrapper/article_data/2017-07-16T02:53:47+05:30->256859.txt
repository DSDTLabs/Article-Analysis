GURUGRAM: Increasing humidity over the last couple of days, along with the absence of rain, have seen the mercury edging up in Gurgaon.

 The temperature in Gurgaon is generally one to two degrees Celsius higher than that of Delhi. 
 
 School children, in particular, had a tough time dealing with the heat. “Generally we play football in the evening, but these days it’s so humid we prefer to stay indoors,” said Rohit Solanki (18) who lives in Sushant Lok 1. “It’s terrible outside. We had expected it would rain.”
 
 The met office had predicted heavy rain for three days, July 11, 12 and 13, across   but the prediction proved to be wrong. “There were some scattered spells of rain, but these were of no use. On the contrary, they aggravated humid condition across the city,” said Sushir, a resident of Mahindra Aura in Palam Vihar. “It feels as if you are sitting inside a sauna.”
 
 On Saturday, the maximum temperature in the city touched 33 degrees Celsius, but the himidity made the real feel around 44 degrees Celsius. The minimum was 27 degrees Celsius.
 
 However,   has again predicted there will light rainfall for three days starting Sunday evening. “There is an advancement of the south-west monsoon into the area,” said a senior IMD official. “Under its effect, we might see light rainfall from Sunday evening. There will be sporadic rains across Delhi-NCR, including Gurgaon on July 17 and 18 as well.”
 
 An IMD official said the fresh spell of rain will bring down temperature across the city and provide much needed relief. “The month of July is likely to be humid, except few days when rainfall will bring temperatures down,” said the official.
