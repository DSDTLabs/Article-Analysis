CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday rejected a petition seeking   for the late   chief minister J Jayalalithaa.

 A high court bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar also declined to dictate the central government over conferring India's highest civilian honour to Jayalalithaa. 
 
 The bench, while hearing the PIL filed by K K Ramesh, also made it clear that deciding on conferring such honours was on the realm of the committee concerned and that courts could not issue directions even to consider representations. 
 
 Ramesh in his PIL had cited an earlier order of another division bench that had asked authorities to consider representations demanding the award for Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
 
 However, the first bench made it clear that deciding on conferring such honours was the on the realm of the committee concerned and that courts could not issue directions even to consider representations.
 
 In his petition, Ramesh said Jayalalithaa was a three-time chief minister of Tamil Nadu and that she had implemented several welfare schemes such as low cost canteens, free laptops and bicycles for students to alleviate sufferings of common people. 
 
 The petitioner, who is from Tamil Nadu Centre for Public Interest Litigation, said Jayalalithaa got best actress award in Tamil Nadu and honours at Russian film festival.
 
 Earlier, the Tamil Nadu   had decided to recommend the late AIADMK chief for the Bharat Ratna. Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam had met Prime Minister   in Delhi to hand over a letter that would request the government to bestow the Bharat Ratna on Jayalalithaa and to install her bronze statue in the Parliament complex.
