AHMEDABAD: After the implementation of the Gujarat   (Regulation of Fees) Bill, 2017, fees of several schools are likely to be reduced. Education experts say the direct impact of the reduction is likely to be on the quality of education as schools’ budgets may shrink. The experts suggested that schools will first start cutting   and some facilities. Cutting down the number of teachers is also another possibility. 

 Private schools are evaluating ways to maintain quality in the face of fee caps. “Our school’s approach to maintain quality is holistic and if fees are reduced, it will be difficult to retain current procedures,” said Kamal Mangal, trustee, Anand Niketan School Group. “Schools are operated through private loans and the reduction in fees will make it all the more difficult to manage expenditure.”
 
 Schools feel they will have to cut down on extra-curricular activities and activity-based learning. Moreover, school authorities say, expenditure will only increase with the implementation of the seventh pay commission and the need to maintain the mandated student-teacher ratio. If education quality diminishes, schools will be forced to reduce fees further as results would be poor.
 
 Manan Choksi, trustee, Udgam School, said: “The key requirements of   are well-qualified teachers, emphasis on co-curricular and sports activities.” Choksi said CBSE stipulates a student-teacher ratio of 1.5. “We are maintaining a 2.5 ratio,” Choksi said. “The speaker system and digital media for teaching are among the school’s amenities. However, everything has a cost and if our budgets are limited, we may have to cut down on them.”
 
 Some schools believe that there is no connection between fees and quality of education.  , director, Nirma School, said: “Education is not a commercial product. What is being sown is what will be reaped. The reduction of fees is not likely to affect the quality of education at all.”
