 is someone who is not much into the gossip circles of Tollywood. 

 The brother of Stylish star Allu Arjun is making his steps towards sealing his image in the industry only lately. With a couple of average youthful entertainers, Sirish always keeps his profile low-key.
 
 
 Stunning everyone on Monday morning, pictures of the actor surfaced while he was partying and having fun with none other than the GVK grand daughter, designer Shriya Bhupal, who called off her wedding to Akkineni sicon Akhil, after a lavish engagement ceremony, very recently.
 
 
 The pictures have been going viral ever since and depicted the actor in a merry mood as he lifted up Shriya with one hand. In another picture, the Sirish was seen swaying with Shriya dancing all along.
 
 These pictures have raised many eyebrows and wondered many, both inside the industry and out. Shriya Bhupal hogged the attention of commoners when she was announced as the fiancee of Akhil followed by an elaborate fairy tale engagement. While we never know what must have caused their relationship to hit the rock, these pictures only hint that the both of them are having a gala time at a gathering.
 
 Allu family and Konidela family are said to be close friends of GVK's and we do know that Upasana Konidela, one of the close friends of Shriya was the centre of attraction at the latter's engagement ceremony. Rumours also had it that Upasana tried to look into the issue about their break-up, but in vain.
 
 Meanwhile, Shriya just returned from a long vacation at the US and is said to be soon tying the knot with an NRI business man. The designer is too sure enjoying her life post cancellation of engagement and wedding with Akkineni Akhil.
 
 Let us wait for more updates on the same.
