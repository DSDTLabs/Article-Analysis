MYSURU: The   has issued only five Completion Report’s (CR) in the last 18 months, said MCC commissioner G Jagadeesha at the   Regulation and Development Act meet here on Tuesday.

 Pointing at the violations by builders and individuals, he said, “The sanctioned plans submitted to the Mysuru City Corporation were different from the built plan submitted to obtain CRs. Builders and individuals need to comply with the   act.”
 
 “If the building is built without any violation, I will see to it that the CR is issued within a week’s time,” Jagadeesha said.
 
 Assistant engineer of RERA Karnataka, Satya Narayan said, “As per the act, any project which is executed on an area of over 500 sq mt (5281 sq ft) and has over 8 units on the site, be it a commercial building, apartment complex, or residential complex, they will have to adhere to the act.”
 
 Stating that the real estate sector will be streamlined through the act, he said, “RERA will usher in transparency and ensure the consumer is safeguarded. It is beneficial for the builders as well. However, those builders who used to collect advances and fail to deliver will be the ones who will bear the brunt of the act.”
 
 Consumer adjudication officer of RERA Karnataka,   said, “Buyers who buy properties from RERA registered builders or through RERA registered property agents can report about issues they have faced on the website. We are bound by the act to resolve the issue within 60 days in 3 sittings.”
 
 “However, if a property is bought by an individual through an agent or builder who is not registered under RERA, then we can’t do much,” he added.
 
 Claiming that 35 complaints have been resolved so far, Palakshappa said, “Up until this month, we have resolved 35 complaints and are set to resolve another 20 in the coming days.”
 
 Builders and cooperative society members who were part of the meet voiced their concerns over the snail’s pace at which files move at the DC office, MCC, and MUDA.
