Nagpur: Two goons allegedly fired a round towards 29-year-old Rahul Joshi, a devotee of Asaram Bapu, on January 14. Joshi was heading to the ashram located in Fetri on Katol Road from Gorewada ring road in his car when the incident took place. The goons, who too were in a car, overtook Joshi’s vehicle and shot at the driver’s side window and fled from the spot as they missed the target.

 A frightened Joshi lost control over the wheel and dashed his vehicle on the road side. He immediately informed Gittikhadan   who too rushed to the spot. The offence of attempt to murder was registered against the assailants on Sunday. Joshi claimed one of the assailants was Punit, alias Piyush, who belonged to the trustees’ group who managed funds of Asaram ashram. 
 
 However, investigators are not convinced that a   had actually been fired as they found no evidence to back the claim.
 
 Cops said Asaram devotees split into two groups, trustees and Sadhak (seekers), in 2007. The Sadhaks were not happy with the trustees, alleging that they had misused funds. The delay in the release of Asaram, who is incarcerated on charges from sexual assault, also added to the dispute, with the Sadhaks claiming that the trustees wasted a substantial amount of funds in lawyer’s fees.
 
 Earlier too, Joshi, residing in Itwari, was thrashed by trustees in the Jodhpur ashram. An offence had also been registered in the local police station.
 
 Sources from the Gittikhadan police station said Joshi had given letter to CP office, stating that he was getting threat calls.
 
 “Police rushed to the spot and forensic experts, too, were summoned. We saw that the front window was broken and vehicle too was damaged at the front lower side,” said an officer. He, however, doubted Joshi’s claim that a bullet had been fired, since the police did not find any crucial evidence inside the complainant’s car.
