MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday questioned the state why police personnel travel in suburban train  .

 A bench headed by   heard a PIL by   who is 50% disabled and travels on Central and Western Railway lines to reach his Mahim workplace. In his petition, he said he regularly suffered while boarding and alighting the coach due to unauthorized commuters, policemen, GRP, RPF personnel and railway servants travelling illegally in it. 
 
 In September 2013 the state’s disability commissioner directed that action be taken on Gaikwad’s complaint. The railways was also ordered to install CCTV cameras in the coaches for the disabled, and provide seating arrangements on platforms and audio visual assistance. His advocate Jaideep Tanna said there has been no compliance with the 2013 order.
 
 Advocate T J Pandian, appearing for railways, said RPF is monitoring the coaches and taking action against trespassers. A note submitted to the court said action has been taken against 105 trespassers, including policemen, by imposing fines, but the menace continues. 
 
 Pandian said the director general of police has been informed about the menace. The judges asked him to serve a copy to the state to get its response. “The contention seems to be that the state police are doing this,’’ Justice Oka said. The judges have posted the hearing on January 18 saying the court will pass “effective” directions.
