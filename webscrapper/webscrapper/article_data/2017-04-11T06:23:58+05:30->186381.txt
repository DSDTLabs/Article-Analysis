BENGALURU: A   under the  , forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has approved the state’s proposal to set up   (ESZs) around 12  .

 At a recent meeting, the panel recommended that ESZs be established in 12 forest areas, including Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on the outskirts of Bengaluru and Ramadevara Betta Vulture Sanctuary in Ramanagara district. Only   didn’t get the committee’s nod.
 
 Declaration of ESZs around wildlife sanctuaries or national parks will go a long way in protecting wildlife as it will help regulate activities which can threaten protected areas. The national meeting saw representatives from many states who presented various ESZ proposals. From Karnataka, P Ravi Kumar, additional chief secretary, forests, and BJ Hosmath, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), attended the meeting.
 
 For BNP, which spans over 260.51 sqkm, the original proposal envisaged an ESZ spread across 268.96 sqkm. However, the state government revised the proposal to reduce the size to 181.57 sqkm; the area includes 16 revenue enclosures. The expert committee recommended the finalization of the draft notification, subject to the views of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on the inclusion of revenue enclosures in the ESZ.
 
 For Ramadevara Betta Vulture Sanctuary, which is spread over 3.46 sqkm, the government’s proposal of a 7.56 sqkm ESZ was approved. The state, however, suggested a few changes with regard to construction activities. The state also requested a few changes regarding setting up of industries, establishment of hotels and resorts, and installation of electrical lines. The committee then asked the state for a list of endangered species of animals, especially vultures. 
 
 The panel recommended 32 proposals across the country and deferred 15.
