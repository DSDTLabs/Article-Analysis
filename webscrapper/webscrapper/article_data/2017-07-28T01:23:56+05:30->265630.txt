NEW DELHI: Delhi government is going to prune the number of   for 10,000 new autorickshaw   to weed out existing  . The list of applicants is now expected to get shorter.

 The transport department had invited applications for new permits in January and the deadline was end of February. The response was unprecedented as more than 22,000 applications were received. The department shortlisted 11,177 applications, but the plan to issue new permits was put on hold after complaints about many applicants having already held permits earlier.
 
 In December last year, the high court had directed Delhi government to complete the process of issuing 10,000 fresh permits by March 31, 2017, but later extended the deadline to July 31. “We have moved an application in the court. Delhi government is of the view that only new people should get permits,” transport minister   said.
 
 The new permits were scheduled to be issued from the first week of July for which the transport department had made major arrangements at its   fitness centre in north Delhi’s Burari. With the process getting delayed, the arrangements have now been dismantled. While shortlisting applicants, priority was given on seniority of licence held by the applicant. This meant that somebody who held a permit 10 years ago would have featured at the top of the list and would have got a permit again. The process was halted to stop any allegations from surfacing later.
