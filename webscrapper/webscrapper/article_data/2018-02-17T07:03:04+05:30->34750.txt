AHMEDABAD: The alleged Rs 11,000-crore fraud by   echoed in the   board meeting.   leaders demanded an inquiry and an explanation from officials, over supplying a vendor a letter of intent (LoI) for setting up the ‘Ahmedabad Eye’, on the lines of the London Eye.

 Dinesh  , Congress’s leader of opposition in the  , during the budget meeting said that a scam similar to Nirav Modi’s may have been committed in the AMC. He alleged that the Sabarmati River Front Development Corporation has given a letter of intent, allocating 20,000 square metres of land, for setting up a London eye on the riverfront. The letter of intent was given to Saloria Architects.
 
 Sharma, drawing a parallel, said that Nirav Modi siphoned off crores only through a letter of intent. “I wonder if the London-based Saloria Architects are the letter of intent from the corporation to secure loans from banks. The architecture firm signed a memorandum of understanding in 2011 and the corporation has increased the timeframe for setting up of the ‘Ahmedabad Eye’ on three occasions.”
 
 Sharma said the architect is yet to provide a proposal for the project. “I suspect the architect would have taken loans from banks based on the letter of intent. I request the commissioner and mayor to assure the board that the architect has not committed any fraud or taken any loan. If such a loan is taken or fraud is committed, the commissioner or mayor should take responsibility for it.”
