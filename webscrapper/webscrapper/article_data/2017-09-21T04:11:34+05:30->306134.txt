NEW DELHI: In one of their biggest seizures this year, customs arrested a passenger at the   on Tuesday evening for trying to smuggle in gold bars worth over Rs 3 crores. Officials said the passenger is suspected to be a carrier, with interrogation underway to determine where the gold may have been headed.

 The incident occurred on Tuesday evening when a 39-year-old Egyptian national arrived from Dubai through flight EK-516. Customs officials said the passenger was intercepted purely on the basis of suspicion after he appeared to be extremely nervous while crossing the green channel.
 
 “He was walking strangely and slowly. He also appeared nervous, so he was intercepted for checking. While his luggage revealed nothing, gold bars weighing nearly 1 Kg each were discovered hidden inside his jeans,” said a senior customs official.
 
 Officials say a total of 13 gold bars were found which had been concealed inside the jeans of the passenger, making them extremely heavy and slowing down his pace. The total value of the gold recovered is around 3.03 crores, officials said.
 
 Customs believe the man may have been asked to deliver the gold to an individual or group in Delhi. “Preliminary investigation reveals that he was simply a carrier and was supposed to deliver it here in Delhi,” said the customs official.
 
 The Egyptian national has been arrested and the gold weighing 10.25 Kgs in total has been recovered, customs official said.
