KOLKATA: A box of crayons and a handmade postcard can connect two kids from opposite ends of the earth in a way that technology cannot.  , a 44-year-old IIT-Kanpur alumnus, is running a global initiative to revive the lost art of letter-writing among at least 50,000 children — half of them underprivileged — to bring them closer by breaking barriers.

 Saha, a chemical engineer from  , said the practice of exchanging one letter a month with children born and brought up in a well-heeled environment would boost confidence among the underprivileged kids.
 
 “Imagine two kids from two different backgrounds in terms of class, economy and distance exchanging neatly written and hand-painted letters. Each tells a story of identity, perspective, hope and friendship. It automatically becomes a learning process for both children and gives them a chance to share ideas,” said Saha, head of Crayons of Hope, a non-profit organization.
 
 Any child between seven and 14 can join this multilingual programme — Hopelets — by exchanging ‘letters of hope’ for a year with a new friend.
 
 “Parents just need to enrol their child’s name with us and follow our curriculum,” added Saha.
 
 Each month, before writing a letter, Hopelets volunteers guide the kids through workshops and interaction programmes.
 
 For Mumpy, a Hopelets member from Australia, it is a chance to inform her friend   in Delhi about  . In return, she gets a colourful postcard of Qutub Minar.
 
 Swastika Gurung, cofounder and CEO of the project, explained: “Suppose, a Hopelets child sends a letter about his mission to become a teacher, he/she will have to draw a classroom on the back leaf of the letter. When he receives a reply from a New York school kid, who wants to become an astronaut, it will have an illustration of a rocket or a spacecraft.”
 
 Some of the topics that the Hopelets kids have talked about in their letters include favourite games, best tourist spot visited, favourite person in life, home and school.
