PUNE: At a time when the city’s civic body is groping in the dark about what to do  , Kagal is looking for more waste.

 The historic town in Kolhapur district with a population of 35,000 has set up environment friendly garbage processing unit, generating electricity for streetlights in Kagal. The processing unit needs more trash to generate more power and so the Kagal civic body is holding talks with other entities to get waste.
 
 Over 300 streetlights in Kagal are lit by the electricity generated at Kagal Municipal Council’s processing unit set up by spending Rs3.5 crore using  , developed in Germany. The local administration is planning to light over 15,000 street lamps over the next one year provided it gets adequate waste to run the plant at its full capacity.
 
 Located around 12km from Kolhapur city, Kagal generates about 9 tonnes of waste every day. The civic body there has decided to import waste from nearby villages and industrial units located at its periphery to run the plant at full capacity.
 
 Nitin Kamble, the chief sanitary inspector of the municipal council, said, “We have approached nearby villages and industrial units to provide waste generated in the markets, hotels and canteens. We shall be saving around Rs2.5 lakh every month once all 15,000 street lamps are lit with the help of electricity generated in the plant. At present, we are generating 0.5MW of electricity every day.”
 
 Aneeta Gokhale-Benninger, the president of National Societies for Clean Cities (NSCC), Pune, said, “The cities succeeding in tackling the garbage problem have been able to do it only because of active role of civic bodies and involvement of citizens.
 
  In Pune, the municipal corporation is shrugging off its responsibility and has given a sub-contract to an agency to collect garbage. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) must collect garbage and make citizens segregate their waste. Citizens pay taxes to the PMC and it must take care of the city’s garbage.”
