CHANDIGARH:   (PU) syndicate on Saturday decided to re-advertise posts for dean college development council (DCDC) and chief of university security (CUS). For the post of DCDC, the applications will be invited considering the new   guidelines. 

 A screening committee had already shortlisted 13 candidates for the post of DCDC and interview letters were also issued to the eligible candidates. However, the then outgoing DCDC, Naval Kishore, had reached the Punjab and Haryana High Court with the matter and the court asked the competent authority to take a decision. 
 
 It was after the high court's decision on April 18, 2017, to permit the university to 'take further steps pursuant to impugned advertisement' that the PU had written to the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) to fill the post. 
 
 The syndicate has accepted to fall back to 2+2+1 formula instead of 3+2 for re-employment of superannuated principals of the colleges affiliated to the university. 
 
 Syndicate member   gave his dissent on the matter stating that he was against the re-employment beyond the age of 60 years. 
 
 In addition to this, it was unanimously decided to evolve a skill training process for the staff and introduce incentive scheme for rewarding the performers.
 
 Meanwhile, the varsity vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover briefed the syndicate regarding an MoU between   (NTU) and Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh. 
 
 He said that NTU wants to run courses in partnership with the PU for joint degree to be given by both the universities as large diaspora of Punjabi students are located in that University.
