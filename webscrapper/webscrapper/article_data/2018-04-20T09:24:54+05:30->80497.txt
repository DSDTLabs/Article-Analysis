PUNE:   on Wednesday booked a woman from Ahmedabad for   of a public sector bank and withdrawing Rs8.17 lakh from the account of a central government office on Paud road. 

 A complaint was lodged with the Deccan police on Thursday. Senior inspector Ajay Kadam of the Deccan Gymkhana police said an offence of cheating and forgery had been registered against the woman. The crime occurred last November and came to light during an audit.
 
 The woman made fake cheques of the bank's Ahmedabad branch. The cheques had all the details of the office, including the account number and the name. 
 
 The woman withdrew Rs3.21 lakh on November 20 from another public sector bank's Karve road branch, Kadam said. Within seven days, the woman encashed another cheque for Rs4.96 lakh.
 
 "In the last week of November, she deposited a third cheque to withdraw another large sum but this time, the bank official became suspicious and halted the payment. The bank officials then informed the central government office and an internal investigation ensued," Kadam said.
 
 The officials studied the cheques and realized they were clever forgeries. The fake cheques have been sent to government agencies which specialize in forensic analysis of such documents. "We are studying how the cheques were made, where they were printed," he said.
