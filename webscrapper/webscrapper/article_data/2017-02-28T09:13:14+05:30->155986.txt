DHARAMSHALA: To check  ,   has launched operation ‘Neugal Model’, named after the rivulet flowing through Palampur. Police will now book offenders under sections 379 (theft of government property) and 447 (trespassing) of the IPC, to stop them from exploiting the natural resources with heavy machines.

 It is for the first time that such provisions are being invoked against those resorting to illegal mining in the state.
 
 Kangra superintendent of police Sanjeev Gandhi told TOI that routine penalties imposed on them had failed to check   in the area. “They (those penalised) used to pay fines in court to get their machines released. It had become a routine for them,” he said.
 
 Gandhi said that they had imposed this rule for the first time in Palampur, which had been witnessing defacing of scenic water sources in the Dhauladhar ranges. “We filed the first such FIR under theft and trespassing at Neugal, which has shown positive results as mining has stopped there,” he added emphatically. 
 
 Now, the same would be implemented in the state border areas adjacent to Punjab (areas infamous for mining activities). “Since January 4 this year we have seized about 16 JCBs, tractors, tippers and pock-lane machines in this operation against illegal mining,” the SP added.
 
 Earlier, cases of illegal mining were registered under the Mines and Mineral Act. These would only attract a fine of Rs 25,000. Under the theft and trespassing cases, the accused now had to go to court for bail and get their confiscated machinery released, said sources. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police have ordered a ban on mining activities till the demarcation is not done of areas adjacent to Punjab borders.
