BENGALURU: The gunrunner, who is being interrogated for his alleged links with the killing of journalist-activist  , disclosed that he had sourced the live bullets from Uttar Pradesh.

  alias Hotte Manja, a right-wing activist from Maddur in Karnataka's Mandya district, who is now in the custody of the   (SIT), was arrested from a   bus stand on February 18. Fifteen live bullets were recovered from him. His resemblance to CCTV footage of the biker conducting reconnaissance near Gauri's house on the day she was killed and two days before landed him in SIT custody.
 
 "He said a man from a neighbouring state promised him to get bullets from Uttar Pradesh for Rs 1,000 each. According to his confession, Naveen hatched a conspiracy to kill a Mysuru-based rationalist," SIT sources said. SIT is awaiting forensic reports to ascertain if Naveen was the biker spotted near Gauri's residence.
 
 On the target-practice camp that Naveen allegedly organised, sources said they need more time to comment on it. "Naveen claims he was visiting a relative's farmhouse. We are investigating the forests and farmhouse," another officer said.
