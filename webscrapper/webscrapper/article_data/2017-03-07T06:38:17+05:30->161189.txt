BHADOHI: Politics aside, in the Muslim-dominated villages of  , boundary walls around `kabristans' are wanted by not only Muslims but also the Hindus. Locals say such walls have helped resolve everyday conflict in these villages.

 “Every time they (Muslims) brought a body for burial, there would be an argument over claims that they were burying the body outside the burial grounds,“ said Lalchand Misra of   gram sabha. To resolve the situation, a boundary wall was erected around the `kabristan' using gram panchayat funds. More than half of Rutahan's population is Muslim and the villagers pooled in money to get the boundary wall built around the burial ground.
 
 “Brahmins, OBCs are among those doing farming in our villages. They have been helped the most through the move as they often complained of encroachment of their fields by burials in the  .The argument at times used to take an ugly turn. Now, their fields will not be encroached upon,“ said Jaddupur pradhan Mohd Muslim.
 
 In some villages, it was `kabristan' land itself that was encroached upon. “ A big portion of the kabristan's land was encroached upon by OBCs in our village and they do farming on that land. Now, at least the walled area will be protected,“ said one Islamuddin.
