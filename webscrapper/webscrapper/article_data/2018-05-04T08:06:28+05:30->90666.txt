KOLKATA: After the   station incident on Monday night, there has been a   from youths, who shared their encounters with moral police. On Metro Railways’ Facebook page, a young chef wrote about his experience on Nalin Sarkar Street. Saptarshi Mandal and his girlfriend, Tulika Bandhu, insist such incidents prove moral guardians are suddenly gaining strength in a city that earlier had a progressive image.

 
 According to Mandal, moral police targeted him for just “speaking” to his girlfriend on Sunday morning. “My girlfriend and I were strolling in our locality around 8.40am before I went to work at11am. An elderly person on a cycle suddenly started abusing us verbally and accused us of making out,” he said.
 
 Bandhu was equally aghast, “As the man hurled abuses and said we weren’t allowed to make out in a respectable locality, others joined in the clamour.”
 
 Mandal alleged an elderly woman pushed him. “Everyone wanted to give us lectures on how we were spoiling Kolkata’s image.An inebriated van-puller packed a few punches at my boyfriend,” Bandhu said.
 
 When TOI contacted to Atin Ghosh, MMiC (health), he said he wasn’t aware of it. “Two youngsters can always stand and talk to each other. Nobody can object if they aren’t crossing limits. If people have done what these youngsters are claiming, it is wrong. I’ll look into it.”
