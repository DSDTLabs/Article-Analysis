AHMEDABAD: The state government has formed a new   (FRC) headed by  ,  . The committee will decide on the fees in the  , pharmacy, MBA, MCA, architecture and other technical courses in the state.

 The committee will decide the fee structure for nearly 600 colleges in the state. Officials said that other members of the committee include  , who had served two terms as the vice-chancellor of  , Jaimin Vakil a chartered accountant, Anil Patel, president of Ganpat institutes and the director of technical education.
 
 The only change in the committee was that of Kamlesh Joshipura replacing Manoj Soni, while Jaimin Shah replaced B M Shah as chartered accountant. The new committee will fix the fees for three years and it is making efforts to ensure that the fee structure is fixed well before the students take admission in the professional courses.
 
 The admission committee has asked colleges to send the details of their expenditures and audited accounts. This would be the fourth revision in the fee structure since fee regulation for the professional courses came into effect in Gujarat from 2008.
 
 Officials said that this would be the second term for Justice Akshay Mehta as his first term for three years ended on April 30. The committee is likely to permit an increase of around 10% in the fee structure as not many students are opting for admission in engineering and MBA and MCA courses.
 
 Last year during admissions around 50 engineering and MBA colleges had written to the fee regulatory committee for professional courses not to increase their fees as they were finding it difficult to get students. The committee will decide three different fees for the next three years which would be applicable to students from their entry year.
