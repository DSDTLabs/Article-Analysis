LUCKNOW: Union textile minister  , though not naming BJP leader  , on Saturday, suggested that women—be it in politics or otherwise—should be respected by all.

 She said that the comment on Priyanka Gandhi was of such a nature that she would not be able to read it out.
 
 Irani was referring to Katiyar’s alleged comment that there were more beautiful (Congress) campaigners than Priyanka Gandhi. 
 
 Replying to a question on the remark by Katiyar, Irani said, “Women should be respected but I would like to ask Priyanka, why this selective silence and selective outrage? Why didn’t Priyanka react when remarks were made on me. Is it that reactions would come as per her political convenience,” Irani said. 
 
 She said UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, his wife and Kannauj MP  , Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka should give their opinion on triple talaq.
 
 “I believe there should be discussion on women’s honour. Akhilesh, Rahul, Dimple or Priyanka should discuss our views on triple talaq. They should all share their opinion on triple talaq,” said Irani.
