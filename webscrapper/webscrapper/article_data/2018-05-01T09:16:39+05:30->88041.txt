CHENNAI: Technologies that support the recycling of waste through solar powered mobiles, reduction of the oil contamination at petrol bunks and other gas stations, monitoring and prevention of preterm births were among the seven research proposals selected under IIT Madras’s I-NCUBATE progamme to find a scope in the business market. 

 The seven weeks training provided the researchers a platform to demonstrate their ideas and witness the implementation in the markets. The students expressed that the programme has changed their approach towards research. “During the first week, we were bombarded with all technical terms and it was extremely difficult to follow them. But during the course, we learnt the vitality of interaction and and studied the market. This led us to know how powerful and successful we can be,” said one of the participants.
 
 Provided with a target of interacting with over 100 business units in the seven weeks, Dan  , director,  , stated that the only way to get their research recognised is to force researchers to get their findings into the market. 
 
 I-NCUBATE is a programme organised by the Gopalakrishnan-Deshpande Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (GDC). 
 
 The event witnessed the coming together of several talented researchers, guided by professionals from IIT-Madras and George Washington University. GDC plans to identify 50 more potential start-up ideas from various scientific and engineering institutions from all over the country by the end of this year.
