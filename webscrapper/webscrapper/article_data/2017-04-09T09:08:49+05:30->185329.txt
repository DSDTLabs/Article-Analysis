LUCKNOW: Evading clear reply to whether former state   Mohammad   and his family members have been indicted by the Central   Council or not, Union minister for minority affairs   said, “Jo imaandar hai usey chheda nahin jaayega aur jo beimaan hai usey chhoda nahin jaayega (honest will not be touched and corrupt will not be spared).” 

 In city on Saturday, after his first meeting with state minority affairs department officials, Naqvi said that since the time Modi government came to power, Rs 15,000 crore was given for various minority welfare schemes and whether any of it had been misused would be clear only after a detailed study.
 
 Naqvi also announced that the Union government would soon launch Ghareeb Nawaz Skill Development centres in UP for minority with a ratio of 60:40. He added that 40% per cent seats would be reserved for women from minority community and around 20 centres would be opened in the state.
