CHANDIGARH: A day after Mount Carmel School's principal said they did not activate their   because parents did not pay for it, the parents' association of the Sector 47 school questioned the claim in an email on Wednesday.

 The association said the school never asked for a payment and they had been paying increased fee for transport since the school introduced GPS and   cameras in buses. “We, on behalf of members of the association, would like to tell you that payment for installation of GPS in buses has already been paid to the schoolbus contractor for the past two years as and when demanded by the school management. But, no fees has been demanded for GPS app (SIC),“ the association said.
 
 The association said doubted the school's claim that an app was ready. “When we asked the contractor about it on Tuesday , the contractor told us that the GPS system access had not be given to parents as the company had not provided such provision to date,“ Gurpreet Katwal, a member of the association, told TOI.
 
 The association also asked the school to provide record of CCTV cameras and the GPS installed along with a communication through which school demanded money for the service.
 
 `SCHOOLS' CLAIM NOT JUSTIFIED'
 
 State transport authority (STA) additional secretary Rajiv Tewari said schools claiming that the GPS service was not activated because some parents had not paid for the it was not justified. “It is about students' safety.
 
 Schools cannot dodge their responsibilities,“ he said.
