NEW DELHI: The Pro Wrestling League ( ), whose previous two editions were marred by instances of organisational mismanagement, has once again found itself in the news for wrong reasons.

 Less than 24 hours after the   pulled out of the PWL accusing the organisers of "cheating", the franchise, captained by Rio Olympics bronze medallist  , made a complete u-turn and returned to the league, blaming a private sports management firm for the mess.
 
 Late on Wednesday night, an official press release from the Maharathi's media team had claimed that "in a reaction to cheating by the PWL organisers, led by ProSportify CEO  , the team owners of the Maharathi have decided to withdraw from the third edition of the PWL with immediate effect".
 
 The trigger for their haphazard decision was an incident that occurred during the toss time between Maharathi and their opponent, Veer Marathas. After Malik won the toss, she opted to block the wrestler in the 74kg category but was prevented from doing so by the organisers in a clear violation of the rules, alleged the release.
 
 Malik then had no option but to block a wrestler in another weight category and the 74kg category proved vital in the final outcome of the match, as Maharathi lost the tie 3-4 to Marathas.
 
 Meanwhile,Punjab Royals scored a 6-1 victory over Delhi Sultans on Thursday.
