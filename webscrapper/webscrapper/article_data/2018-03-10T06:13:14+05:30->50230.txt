BENGALURU: In an interesting turn of events relating to the bail plea hearing of Mohammed Nalapad  , accused of assaulting   L, both the special public prosecutor ( ) and high court judge expressed doubts about the veracity of the victim's medical records, produced by the petitioner. 

 While Justice   was surprised by the reference at the end of Vidvat's discharge summary, which said "no untoward incidents had happened at his hospital", SSP M S Shyam Sundar raised doubts over the authenticity of daily reports and the discharge summary produced before the court by  , son of the Shantinagar MLA N A Haris.
 
  The judge wanted to know from senior advocate C V Nagesh, who's representing Haris, whether he had seen a discharge summary containing such a reference. "How can a doctor issue such a discharge summary? It appears to be stage-managed," the judge observed. Nagesh requested the court to ignore it. 
 
 The SPP claimed he was shocked how the accused accessed the documents when they were denied to the investigator. He said the fabricated reports have been produced to stall the probe. Strongly opposing the bail plea, the SPP said if the petitioner can exert such influence and manoeuvre the investigation by destroying evidence even after being lodged in jail, he can do more harm if he gets bail.
 
 
 
  The SPP added that Dr Anand, who had issued the discharge summary, is a plastic surgeon and relative of  , a close political associate of N A Haris, father of the petitioner. He's also an aspirant for an MLC seat. Sundar said the investigator had issued notice to both the hospital and the doctor.
