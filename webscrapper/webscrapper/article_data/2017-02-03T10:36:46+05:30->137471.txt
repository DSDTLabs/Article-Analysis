ALLAHABAD: The upcoming state Assembly elections have come as a saviour for the cash-strapped   ( ) which would be deploying over 4,500 buses for ferrying  , police and homeguards on poll duties in various parts of the state.

 In Allahabad district alone, the police headquarters have demanded a total of 150 buses for  , of which 25 have been already dispatched.
 
 Regional managers of UPSRTC have been asked by the police department to reserve the latest buses for election duty so that any technical fault or breakdown does not affects the transport of security forces. The buses to be provided by regional offices of the state will be on election duty till March 1, till the elections end. 
 
 Regional managers have asked to send the buses with equal number of drivers and reserving 5% of the drivers for emergencies. 
 
 Regional officer of UPSRTC, Harishchandra Yadav said, “Presently UPSRTC is suffering losses to the tune of crores of rupees so the demand for buses is a boon for the corporation. We have already dispatched 25 buses of the total number of 125 additional buses demanded by police headquarters. The requirement may shoot up to 250 later.”
 
 UPSRTC sources said the deployment of buses is likely to hit the regular operations, as the buses sent for election duty are returned only after the elections end. “As most officials will be supervising the buses sent on election duties, UPSRTC will be left with little manpower to manage its regular operations,” said an official of UPSRCTC regional office on condition of anonymity.
