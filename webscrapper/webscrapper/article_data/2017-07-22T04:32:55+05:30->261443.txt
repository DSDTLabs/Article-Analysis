KOHIMA: Two days after taking charge of the state from his predecessor  ,   CM TR   on Friday won the vote of confidence. Forty-seven legislators backed Zeliang, while 11 members voted against him in the 60-member Nagaland assembly.

 Of those who supported Zeliang, 36 belong to the NPF, four BJP and seven Independents. On the other hand, 10   MLAs and one Independent voted for Liezietsu, who is yet to become a member of the House. One seat is currently vacant.
 
 Soon after the trust vote, Speaker Imtiwabang Aier adjourned the House sine die.
 
 The voting took place amid confusion over separate whips issued by two NPF factions owing allegiance to Zeliang and Liezietsu. On Thursday evening, Kiyanilie Peseyie, who was appointed NPF chief whip on November 14, 2014, issued a whip asking NPF legislators to vote against Zeliang.
