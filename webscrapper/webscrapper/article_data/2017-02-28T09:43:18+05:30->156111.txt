TRICHY: Never claim special treatment for being a woman, urged the first woman director of National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NIT-T) Mini Shaji Thomas. She was speaking to students of the Women’s Studies department at   ( ), as part of a two day national seminar on “Gender and   and Technocrats: Strategies and Concerns’ on Monday. 

 She said it was difficult for many to accept her as a woman leading from the front. “There is no doubt that you need to work hard to succeed especially when you are a woman,” she said, adding that a woman has the additional responsibility of taking care of the family.
 
 “But that shouldn’t be reason to claim special treatment. This would only strengthen the general perception that as women, we cannot innovate,” she said.
 
 “It is evidenced in researchers, that the career choices of women are limited by the systemic errors and hostile institutional environment,” said head of Women Studies Department N Manimekalai. 
 
 Women faculty and students fail to participate like men in terms of working long hours, attending additional classes, labs and libraries in general, though it is happening in a few cases.
 
 To a certain extent, globalization and digitalization has given autonomy to women in terms of participation in the labour market, employment in IT sector, and corporate enterprises for women, added Manimegalai. 
 
 The two day seminar will discuss the kinds of issues that women face and try to arrive at strategies to provide guidelines to frame policies to increase the retention of women in science, technology, engineering and math.
