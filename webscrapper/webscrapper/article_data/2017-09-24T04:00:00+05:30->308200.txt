Surtis planning Diwali holidays are fuming over inflated rates of air tickets for flights from Surat. While regular airfare to New Delhi is Rs 4,500,   

 “I will spend Bestu Varas (New Year) travelling to Mumbai via road and then fly out to New Delhi with my family. This way we will save on an entire holiday budget to Ooty this Diwali,” said Mihir Bhatia (38), an engineer who works for a private company in Hazira.
 
 “SpiceJet has doubled its price at Rs 9,000 as a one-way fare, while Air India is charging four times the price at Rs 22,000 as a single way fare to New Delhi,” confirmed ticketing agent and holiday arranger Hardik Desai. 
 
 Denizens are upset about wasting a day to get cheaper and better connectivity during Diwali season when almost everyone in the city is in travel mode because of long stretch of holidays from Diwali till ‘Labh Pacham’. Surtis are demanding a cap on airfare and a dedicated train to New Delhi.
 
 Activist for rail and air connectivity Rajesh Modi said, “The city of Surat has 50 per cent population of migrants from New Delhi, Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The entire textile and diamond industry enjoys a weeklong holiday period post Diwali. Unfortunately, in spite of Surat railway station having Rs 400 crore plus revenue, the rail connectivity for a city of 60 lakh population is very limited to New Delhi. A common man cannot dream of flying to New Delhi during this period because of steep rise in prices of air tickets. It is like flying to Dubai. The Udan scheme of cheap airfare is only a distant dream for Surtis, not a reality yet.”
