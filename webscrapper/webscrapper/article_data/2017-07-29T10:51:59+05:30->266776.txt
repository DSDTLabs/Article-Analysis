GUWAHATI: Chief minister   has proposed the central team currently assessing flood situation in   to develop state's 5000 KM stretch of embankment under Prime Minister's special flood and erosion control programme.

 The team came to the state on Tuesday on Prime Minister  's direction to conduct on-the-spot-assessment of damages caused by the recent waves of flood, which has claimed at least 76 lives and affected about 16 lakh people, besides leaving trail of devastation by damaging infrastructure and croplands. Over two lakh hectare cropland are damaged by the deluge.
 
  
  
 
 During a meeting with the seven-member team headed by union home ministry joint secretary   here on Friday, Sonowal suggested the embankments should also be used as roads so that it not only provide flood protection but also provide rural connectivity.
 
  
  
 
 
 Though the state government had earlier submitted the proposal on embankment-cum-road project to the Centre, Sonowal told the team to include in their report this proposal as one of its recommendations.
 
 The chief minister pointed out that most of the embankments which were constructed as a safeguard to rural economy and habitations from flood have outlived their life.
 
  
  
 
 "Once the 5000-KM stretch of embankment is converted into road-cum-embankments, this would help rural people in terms of connectivity and will benefit rural economy as well as tourism. This initiative would also facilitate implementation of PMGSY to connect every village in the state," Sonowal said.
