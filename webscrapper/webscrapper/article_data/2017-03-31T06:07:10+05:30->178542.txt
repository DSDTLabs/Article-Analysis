Kolkata: If you thought travelling with luggage in a cab and forgetting to take it while alighting is strange, listen to this. Not one, or even two, but 20 riders who booked   cabs in the city forgot to take their suitcase and backpacks last year. 

 They are among 1,600 Kolkata riders who reported lost items to Uber last year, the fifth highest among 29 Indian cities where Uber cabs ply. 
 
 If it is any consolation, the most forgetful riders are in Bengaluru, followed by Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. “Kolkatans seem to have been the only ones forgetting their luggage in the car, marking almost five such incidents every quarter,” an Uber spokesperson said after releasing the Lost & Found India   that captures interesting rider insights.
 
 According to the index,   and rings are the two most commonly forgotten items countrywide, along with chargers and sunglasses. Surprisingly, there have been instances of riders who have left behind bulletproof vests, potted plants, pool sticks, kites, and even puppies.
 
 Among the other unique items forgotten in Uber cabs in the country are a cheque worth Rs 15 lakh, a keyboard, expensive watch and footwear, liquor bottles, grocery bags and cricket bats.
 
 And it is invariably in the festive month of December, when joy is in the air, that riders get most forgetful. Of the top five forgetful weeks, four are in December. Saturday is the most common day when Indians forget things in cabs, followed by Friday and Sunday.
 
 “Through this data and rider insight-backed index, we want to bring riders’ attention to the options available to them in case they lose something in an Uber in a fun and playful manner,” said,  , general manager, Bengaluru, Uber India.
