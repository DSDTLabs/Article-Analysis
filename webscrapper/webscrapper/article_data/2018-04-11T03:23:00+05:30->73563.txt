Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court issued notices to the Election Commission of India ( ), the election officials concerned and the state government, over a petition filed by former   and the defeated 2017 candidate, Narayan Patel of the BJP.

 Patel has sought action against election officials for their inaction by which two voters – Haresh Patel and Dipaben Patel — were registered in the constituency twice. Patel demanded the registration of a complaint under section 131 of the Representation of the People Act against the chief election officer, for failing to perform his duty and act against these two persons who knowingly allowed themselves to be registered as voters at two different places and had perhaps voted at two places on December 14, 2017 for the assembly election.
 
 The petitioner’s advocate, Shivang Jani, contended that the candidate had brought the issue to the notice of election officials in February and was told on March 15 that his information was correct. The voters were indeed registered twice due to oversight and both voters had given applications to delete their names.
