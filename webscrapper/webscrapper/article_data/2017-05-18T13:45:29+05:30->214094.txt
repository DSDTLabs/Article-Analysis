NAGPUR: A nine-acre land at Nara in Jaripatka, the market value of which is around Rs36 crore, is likely to be returned to the complainant   and his partners at   through   at the   on Thursday.

 Omprakash Bajaj and Sukhdev Bhagchandani, who too were partners of the firm, would set to accord mutual consent to cancel the sale deed of the plot which was grabbed by Bajaj’s brothers, Jaiprakash and Suresh, through forged documents.
 
 Omprakash and Sukhdev were sent to police custody for a day on Wednesday after being produced before the court by Special Investigation team (SIT), who had placed the duo under arrest. SIT had sought a seven-day PCR. Omprakash’s counsel argued that the accused was ready to be part of the mediation process to settle the issue amicably.
 
 Police said Jhulelal developers, in which Dodhani, Bhagchandani, Omprakash and others were partners, had purchased a land from Kamlesh Jaiswal and others in 1999-2000. Subsequently, there was a ‘status quo’ on the land due to a civil litigation. In 2005, Omprakash and Bhagchandani connived to prepare a power of attorney in favour of Jaiprakash without informing other partners of their firm.
 
 With the POA, Jaiprakash had prepared a sale deed in his and brother Suresh’s favour purchasing the land for only Rs23 lakh. 
 
 After learning about the cheating, Dodhani and other partners had approached cops. Following their complaint, SIT had registered offence against Bajaj brothers, Bhagchandani and also deputy registrar, talathi and circle inspector of Sitabuldi from the revenue department.
