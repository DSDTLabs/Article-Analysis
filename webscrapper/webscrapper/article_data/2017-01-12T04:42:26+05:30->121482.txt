MUMBAI: The   ( ) has identified about 32,000 entities that were involved in manipulating penny stocks for long-term capital gains, against which it is proposing action by the income tax department. The market regulatorâ€™s board is expected to discuss this and recommend appropriate steps in its meeting on January 14, sources said.

 Earlier, investigations by Sebi had found that several entities had joined hands to manipulate prices of stocks that were either not traded for long or were in low single-digits. These stocks were used to create artificial profits and losses for the manipulators and others for a price. 
 
 A large number of these entities were found to be misusing the stock exchange platform to book long-term capital gains, which was illegal. Sebi has identified several such manipulators who violated securities laws in addition to tax laws. Some of those stocks have been suspended by the exchanges, and a large number of manipulators have been barred from the market.
 
 The Sebi board, which is scheduled to meet at Jaipur, is also expected to decide on some measures aimed at attracting municipalities to offer bonds to investors. On December 24, in his inaugural speech at the   (NISM) at Patalganga near the city, Prime Minister   had asked Sebi and the department of economic affairs (of finance ministry) if they can ensure at least 10 cities in India issue municipal bonds within one year. 
 
 The Sebi board will also consider tightening settlement norms, while fresh steps would be taken to popularise new investment vehicles like REITs and InvITs, a senior official said. It would also consider allowing mutual funds to invest in REITs and InvITs.
