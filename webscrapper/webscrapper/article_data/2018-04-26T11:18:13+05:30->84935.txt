INDORE: Delhi Public School ( ) on Wednesday blamed the bus driver for January 5 accident that killed him and five students and told Indore bench of high court that his family has been adequately compensated.

 The bus was checked for mechanical faults and cleared by experts around 11 days before the accident took place in   area on Indore Bypass, DPS said, in a reply submitted before division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice SK Awasthi.
 
 RTO had also issued a fitness certificate following the inspection.
 
 Some norms laid by the state government like mention of driver’s contact number on bus were yet to be covered by the school, DPS’s counsel   said adding these issues could not have led to the accident.
 
 School claimed that government had fixed a maximum speed limit of 60 kmph. The bus was moving at 64 kmph, when the accident took place, DPS said in reply to a PIL by one Pramod Dwivedi.
 
 DPS’ counsel told court that the school has paid Rs eight lakh as compensation to family of the driver. His wife has been offered a compassionate appointment by the school administration.
 
 The school has also made arrangements for free education to his children, the court was told. The school alleged that the petition was not maintainable as it is based on newspaper reports and no concrete evidence has been presented by the petitioner. It can’t be considered as a public interest litigation.
 
 DPS counsel said that the school holds the security of children as foremost priority.
 
 DPS bus accident had evoked strong reactions from different quarters. Police had later booked DPS principal Sudarshan Sonar, its transport officer   and speed governor suppliers   and Jalaj Meshram, in connection to the accident.
