SURAT: City   police will shortly start a helpline number to receive complaints from citizens as a part of the many initiatives being taken by them to improve the overall traffic scenario in Surat. The helpline number will be a medium for the cops to receive feedback and complaints from citizens. People can also send on the helpline number through social media applications images relating to traffic problems for their quick resolution. Citizens have often been contacting senior officers over telephone and action too was taken, but police authorities feel there is a need to streamline the process and thus have thought about this helpline number. 

 “Police will receive complaints over telephone about traffic-related issues and they would be redressed immediately. We have started the process and the announcement regarding helpline number will be made soon. People will be able to send photos as well to the helpline number,” city police commissioner   said.
 
 The police had placed barricades at a few locations in the past few weeks to divert traffic at crowded locations. They had also banned auto-rickshaws on   during peak hours in morning and evening to reduce traffic congestion.
