AHMEDABAD: Cases presented to the full bench of the   ( ) during its visit to   recently had blown holes in the state’s claims on the human rights situation here. The national commission pointed out that redress institutions were being ignored. Shockingly, the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) is so badly ignored by the Gujarat government that it has been rendered headless, without a chairman, for the last six months. Government officials said the   does not have a chairman or the two members it needs, and it just forwards cases to the police to conduct inquiries into them. 

 Serious cases of human rights violations, like custodial torture leading to death, cannot be taken up by the commission without a chairman. 
 
 According to an RTI reply, there were 55 custodial deaths in Gujarat in 2017. The SHRC had so far received 553 cases involving custodial deaths, of which 60 are still pending.
 
 Government sources say the chairman’s post has been vacant since the death of the last chairman, Bhagwati Prasad, a former HC judge, in November last year.
 
 Additionally, one of the commission’s two members left a year ago and the other left last month. The registrar’s post is also vacant.
 
 ADGP P B Gondia, who hold additional charge of investigations in the SHRC, confirmed that no appointments were made to the SHRC after Justice Bhagwati’s death. Junior home minister   was unavailable for comment.
 
 Kaushik Parmar, an activist from Mehsana who has taken up several human rights violation cases with the SHRC said that the vacancies reflect the government’s apathy to the protection of human rights.
 
 “The SHRC posts must be filled immediately and the chairperson and members, whoever they are, should protect the rights of the people and not the government,” said Parmar.
