INDORE: Moments after winning the   title with  ,   brought up the importance of relegating teams in first-class cricket, saying he preferred the idea of   divisions in India’s premier domestic competition. “What worries me is the way teams finishing at the bottom of the table approach the game. I quite liked the idea of having Elite and Plate divisions,” Jaffer said.

 The Indian cricket board (BCCI) did away with the Elite and Plate format five years ago. It divided teams into Group A, B and C. Group C was equivalent to the Plate group, with two teams from the lowes-tranked teams going into the knockouts and thereby getting a place in either Group A or B. But the board decided to shelve this format too and introduced four groups, equally dividing all 28 teams.
 
 “I don’t see the teams finishing last in the groups trying hard enough. The BCCI needs to take action or have a plan against these teams. There are some good players in those teams but the environment in the team isn’t positive enough,” Jaffer said. “There has to be some motivation for all teams throughout the tournament. Going into the Elite group is a good incentive and the fear of relegation will retain the context in the games.”
 
 Jaffer, however, acknowledged: “The quality of cricket has improved. The infrastructure has been upgraded. You can see how that has had an impact. Gujarat won the Ranji Trophy last year. When I started playing, nobody gave them a chance. Even Saurashtra have come up. Assam have also grown well.”
