HYDERABAD: A staggering 142 faculty members from various technical colleges in the city approached the   Technological  , Hyderabad, against college managements saying they had not 'relieved' them even after their resignations had been submitted. 

 The faculty members fear they are part of 'ghost faculty' and that their names have not been deleted from the colleges' websites because of this reason. This, they say, makes it difficult for their current employers to register them. The law says any professor found to be part of two organisations will be immediately blacklisted.
 
 JNTU, has issued a notice to 92 erring colleges and asked them to submit explanations before Saturday, failing which the university will initiate action against the colleges.
 
 "You are hereby informed that the university is in receipt of complaints from few faculty members that they are 'not relieved' (by way of deleting the particulars of the faculty member(s) from your college portal) from your respective colleges even after their submission of resignation as per procedure. In this regard, the university seeks an explanation as to why the following faculty members have not been relieved from your college (sic)," read the notice issued to colleges. 
 
 University officials further said that in case colleges don't respond or their explanation is not satisfactory, the faculty's name and registration numbers will be removed from the college portal by the university to enable them to join a college of their choice.
 
 "The explanation of the college should reach the university on or before April 4, 2017, 5 pm," said Dr  , registrar of JNTU.The move comes after   asked all faculty members with more than one registration number to submit an undertaking, failing which, they will be blacklisted and will also have to face punitive action. 
 
 In 2016, JNTU has blacklisted about 900 teaching faculty for possessing multiple registration numbers.
