MARGAO: Sanvordem MLA Deepak Pauskar has put forth a proposal before the   (GTDC) to develop Dudhsagar waterfalls and Tambdi   temple as part of the state’s tourism circuit.

 Pauskar told TOI that while several facilities for tourists could be developed at the Dudhsagar waterfalls, at Tambdi Surla, the temple and its surroundings could be developed into an eco-tourism spot. “There are several water bodies in Tambdi Surla known for its medicinal properties. I have placed a proposal before GTDC for construction of a ropeway which can attract a large number of tourists,” Pauskar said.
 
 Stating that the Centre’s rural development funds could be utilized for the purpose,   (GSIDC) chairman further said that he has also asked   MP   to take steps in that regard. 
 
 As regards the road leading to the Dudhsagar waterfalls, Pauskar said that interlocking pavers will soon be laid along the 5km stretch from Kulem to Dudhsagar. A proposal in that regard has already been moved to the forest department and the chief minister, he said. 
 
 “Approval from the wildlife board has also been sought, and the work is likely to start within the next two to three months,” Pauskar told TOI.
