Amritsar: In an exemplary judgment, a Pathankot court has awarded 10 years’ imprisonment to a snatcher. According to an official release issued here on Thursday, Pathankot sessions judge Tejwinder Singh has sentence a man to 10 years in jail for snatching earrings of a woman on April 1, 2016. 

 The judge also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 after holding Raj Kumar guilty under Section 379 (theft) of the IPC. He also ordered further imprisonment of two years and a fine of Rs 2,000 under Section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC on him. In case of non-payment of fine, the convict will have to undergo a sentence of two more months.
 
 “It is a landmark judgment that will warn the snatchers that they can’t escape from the clutches of law or get away with mild sentences,” said Pathankot chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Amandeep Kaur Chahal, who is also secretary of district legal services authority (DLSA). She said both sentences would run concurrently.
 
 The judge also expressed concern over increased incidents of snatching of chains, earrings and handbags in the district. She added that 10 years was maximum sentence under the law for such crimes.
