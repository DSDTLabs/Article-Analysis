  Childline, in collaboration with  , a city-based theatre group, will stage the play at Sundarshan Rangamanch at 7pm on August 4.
 
 “As a part of silver jubilee celebrations, we are planning to hold workshops for all those working closely with children and deal with child abuse cases on a daily basis. This play is a part of those workshops,” said Anuradha Sahasrabuddhe, the director of Dnyana Devi Childline.
 
 Established in 1992, the NGO works for the betterment of underprivileged women and children. The spurt in child abuse cases was the reason why Dnyana Devi chose to stage a play on it.
 
 Dnyana Devi has a history of addressing social issues through theatre. Saggherr Loadhii, who has directed the play, has been associated with the NGO for the past 12 years. He has directed plays for them on women education and empowerment.
 
 “For this play, we followed the ‘devised theatre’ form. In this form, the script for the play is not written by a person but is a collective effort by all the members of the troupe. For ‘Shout’, every member came up with monologues, poems and dialogues,” Loadhii said.
 
 “The script of the play will change according to the audience. If the play is being staged for the police, cases highlighting the loopholes in the system will be included. If it is staged for parents and teachers, cases of ignorance will be included in the script,” Loadhii added.
