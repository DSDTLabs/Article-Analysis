NEW DELHI: Having explained the “foolproof” administrative and technical safeguards of EVMs at the all-party meeting on Friday, the   now plans to hold its “EVM challenge” later this month. 

 The challenge will offer political party representatives and technical experts an opportunity to demonstrate   used by  , including those used in the recently concluded assembly polls, over a week to 10 days.
 
 Sources said EC is likely to announce the dates of the upcoming challenge in the first half of next week. The challenge is likely to be timed in the fourth week of this month, giving the parties enough time to prepare.
 
 While the modalities of the challenge are still being finalised, it will be conducted on the lines of a similar exercise held in 2009. 
 
 The EC will offer a set of EVMs to parties to make a demonstration in presence of its technical experts that the EVM can be manipulated and results altered to suit a particular candidate or party. 
 
 As per ground rules being discussed, no participant can bring his own EVM prototype to demonstrate tamperability or take ECI EVM out of the premises where the challenge will be held. EC plans to videograph each of the demonstrations.
 
 Incidentally, there was a debate between AAP and EC on nomenclature of the   at the all-party meeting attended by all seven national parties and 35 recognised state parties. While AAP persisted with its demand for a “hackathon”, EC refused to describe its upcoming challenge as such. 
 
 This even prompted Delhi deputy CM   to tweet from inside the venue that EC was going back on holding the “hackathon”. As TOI had reported first, EC has objected to the word “hackathon” as it maintains that its standalone machines with a one-time programmable chip cannot be “hacked”.
 
 “We are only challenging parties to demonstrate the allegations of tamperability with EVMs. So the nomenclature ‘EVM challenge’ is more appropriate. The difference is just semantics,” said a senior EC functionary.
