PATNA: With the mercury hovering around 40 degree Celsius, hospitals in the city have started receiving patients of heat exhaustion even though it’s just the onset of summer season.

 According to Paras-HMRI hospital’s Dr  , heatstroke is bound to affect many people in these extreme weather conditions. “Forty degree Celsius is dangerous for body; people should be cautious,” he said, adding his hospital received two such cases.
 
 It is also an open secret that water-borne diseases are quite common in summer months. One should avoid eating roadside or stale food and drinking impure water, say doctors.
 
  superintendent Dr  , however, said the premier government hospital was yet to come across any case of heat exhaustion so far. “Most of the cases of heatstroke or heat exhaustion come in the months of May or June. But it’s too hot even in April this year, and people, especially sportspersons and those moving outdoors for work, must take special precautions to prevent stroke,” he said.
 
 Summer is good for your skin, however. “Skin remains constantly moisturised due to sweat and oil secretion,” said dermatologist Dr  .
 
 But sweating may cause fungal or bacterial infection in some people. To prevent this, the doctor advises, one should take bath in the evening as well and avoid wearing wet clothes. 
 
 “After every bath, dry off your skin properly. Avoid using harsh soaps. Use mild soaps instead. Apply moisturiser and sunscreen. Wash face at regular intervals with simple water to get rid of accumulated dirt,” he added.
