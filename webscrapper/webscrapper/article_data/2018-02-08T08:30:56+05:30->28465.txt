HYDERABAD: Blaming authorities for the mental torture he is going through, suspended PhD student Kaluram   of University of Hyderabad (UoH) said that the   is slowly pushing him towards death.

 Speaking to TOI, he said that the varsity is mentally harassing him for his ‘mistake’ and added that without his PhD he has no future.
 
 “I know I have made a mistake by using a wrong word against the professor. I pulled down the post as soon as I realized it (within 20 minutes). Instead of judging me for the word I used, the varsity should see my intent. I wrote the post out of agony, as   questioned the ideology I respect and he has no authority to ask such questions,” said Palsaniya who was rusticated by the university for a period of one year after he was found guilty of posting abusive messages on social media and questioning the credibility of Prof K Laxminarayana of the Department of Economics.
 
 He added that he is a first generation learner from his family and would be the first one to receive a PhD.
 
 “My parents are unaware of my suspension and they would be shattered if they come to know about it. Only my brother knows that I was rusticated, that too after the varsity authorities called him to take me after my suspension,” said Palsaniya, adding that the relay hunger strike which had begun on Tuesday will continue till his suspension is revoked.
 
 Palsaniya, the ex-president of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad(ABVP), UoH, further demanded the varsity to initiate action against   for ‘saffronising’ education and for bringing politics inside the classroom.
 
 He further alleged that the university did not even bother to inform him about his suspension and he was informed about it through media.
 
 Varsity officials, on the other hand, said that Palsaniya and other students did not seek permission to stage relay hunger strike at South Shop-Com and added that they’ll soon take a decision on the issue.
