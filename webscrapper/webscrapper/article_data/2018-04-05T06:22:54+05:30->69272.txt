HYDERABAD: Six-year-old D   holds a baton firmly, adjusts his cap and uniform and thunders “I will catch all thieves and put them in jail.”

 Ishan, suffering from blood cancer and undergoing treatment at   in the city, dreams to be a police officer one day. The terminallyill child’s wish was fulfilled on Wednesday.
 
 “We lost count how many toy revolvers he has. He runs around the house playing a cop. Finally, he feels like one and his smile says it all. His wish has been fulfilled,” D  , mother of Ishan, recalled with her eyes welled with tears.
 
 Ishan, who has been dreaming of becoming a cop one day, did not think twice when he was asked about his wish. The boy, who wore khaki uniform with a nameplate on the chest like other police officials, said he would teach the bad guys a lesson.
 
 “I have this one stick (baton) today and will threaten the thieves using it. I will put them in jail and control law and order in the city to make the streets safe for people,” the little cop said. When asked specifically about safety of women, Ishan said he would increase the number of SHE Teams to make the streets safe for the women.
 
 In December, Ishan and his family got news about his disease. The family took Ishan to hospital after a bout of high fever, which later turned out to be blood cancer. Since then, the family has spent over ?3 lakh on his treatment and were trying to fulfill all his wishes.
 
 “Doctors said only after chemotherapy they can say whether he can survive or not. Since December, they have conducted two sessions of chemotherapy. After each session, he cries and becomes weak. I cannot express my feelings, especially seeing him laugh merrily after a long time, in words,” his father   said.
