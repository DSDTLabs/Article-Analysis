NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board ( ) has gone back to white   for the ongoing   domestic tournament. The board had switched from   to   in the limited-overs tournaments — which is used in international and IPL matches — in December 2015 so that the domestic players could get a feel of what was being used at the highest level.

 However, the current variety of the SG ball doesn’t seem to have pleased the seasoned players in the tournament. “I don’t know why they are using this ball. This doesn’t feel right at all,” an India cricketer told TOI on Wednesday. “If the ODIs and T20Is at home are played with the Kookaburra Turf balls, it makes little sense to play with these balls in domesticT20,” the player added.
 
 According to the players, this ball is hard like marbles and is not travelling off the bat as well as the Turf balls do. “The seam is a lot more pronounced. The balls is taking a lot more turn and if the morning pitch has some assistance, it moves a lot more than usual,” explained the player.
 
 “This is a newly upgraded variety of the SG white ball. It is being tested for the first time in this tournament,” a BCCI official told TOI. The quality of the SG Test ball, which used in home Tests and first-class matches, has also come under scrutiny over the last three years.
 
 
 
 
 The board also decided to do away with having teams from five zones for the knockout stages of the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament. The state associations were informed only after the zonal league stage got underway that two teams from each zone will qualify for the super league unlike last year when a combined team each from five zones played. The participating teams’ officials here at the Ferozeshah Kotla got clarity on the situation on Wednesday afternoon, three days after the tournament started. The knockouts will be held in Kolkata from January 21.
