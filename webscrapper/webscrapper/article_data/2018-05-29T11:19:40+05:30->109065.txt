Meghna Gulzar’s ‘Raazi’ became the fifth movie this year to enter into the Rs 100 crore clubs. The   and Dharma Productions’ film collected Rs 1.82 crore on Monday taking its grand total to Rs 104.32 crore at the box-office.

  approached   for ‘Raazi’ even before she has the script ready for the film and Alia too agreed to do the film, even though they both weren’t sure how and when it will happen. The project was meant for Alia as it landed up with Junglee Pictures and Karan Johar’s Dharma production. Speaking on which Alia had said, “After I met Meghna and I heard that one line it was pretty clear to me that this is a film I have to be a part of at whatever stage in my career as that time there was no clarity as to when it will happen. And then what happened was that it arrived home, it came to   and Junglee Pictures were already on board. So it seemed like a perfect fit where three creative minds; Meghna, Dharma and Junglee came together and it was the perfect timing.”
  
  
 With ‘Raazi’ entering the Rs 100 crore clubs, for Alia, it is her third film to go past Rs 100 crore after ‘2 States’ and ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’.
 
 Directed by a female director and lead by a female actor, ‘Raazi’ sure did break old Bollywood stereotypes and rules of unconventional cinema.
 
 ‘Raazi’ is produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
