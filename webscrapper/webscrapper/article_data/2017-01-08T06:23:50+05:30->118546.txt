AHMEDABAD: The   scare in the city has taken a serious turn, just two days before the Vibrant Gujarat Summit (VGS). The   has asked   to conduct an inquiry into how and why the birds infected with the deadly bird flu virus landed in the city.

 Sources said the collector has asked Ahmedabad rural police to uncover the trail of the birds, from Mumbai to Ahmedabad. Questions have also been raised on why an offence was not registered against the NGO right at the onset by police, for causing danger to public health.
 
 A senior police official of Ahmedabad rural police told TOI that though an offence has not been registered yet, the collector has asked them to conduct a thorough inquiry into the bird flu scare.
 
 “The inquiry will start after VGS summit is over. Our team will visit Mumbai soon,” a top police official said.
 
 The episode started after a team from department of animal husbandry visited Asha Foundation in Hathijan area on December 31 after heavy mortality of the birds kept was reported. The following day, the same organization got over 600 guineafowls abandoned in Vastral area.
 
 As the samples of 10 birds —   — tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the influenza virus, a total of 291 birds and animals at the facility were culled. Harmesh Bhatt, running the foundation, had mentioned that the infected birds were rescued by an animal lover from Crawford Market in Mumbai. The person had handed over 80 guineafowls and 40 turkeys for treatment at the foundation.
 
 On Friday, a two-member team of doctors from Delhi-based National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Safdarjung Hospital visited Hathijan area in the city and reviewed the measures taken by the state administration to curb the spread of the dreaded H5N1virus.
