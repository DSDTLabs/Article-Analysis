HYDERABAD: Mumbai police on Sunday raided the residence of a former history-sheeter in   in connection with an illegal arms case. However, they did not find weapons at the home.

 
  police said Sheikh  ,45, was arrested by Mumbai police a week ago when he was in the process of acquiring ammunition for a country-made weapon he had purchased earlier. They also seized the weapon.
 
 Waheed was taken into police custody after seeking court permission. As part of investigation, a team from Mumbai came to Hyderabad and raided his house in search of weapons.
 
 Waheed had gone to Mumbai to meet one Anand, a native of   and involved in sale of country-made weapons, and bought a weapon and returned to Hyderabad. He was promised ammunition later. On this issue, Waheed went to Mumbai to meet   again and Mumbai police, who were tipped-off, nabbed the duo and arrested them.
 
 In 2015, Hyderabad police had closed a history-sheet against Waheed, pending against him for allegedly participating in some illegal activities. “We closed the historysheet since Waheed’s conduct was good and there were no pending cases. Since Mumbai police have arrested Waheed, we will consider reopening a history-sheet against him,’’ deputy commissioner of police (South Zone) V   said. According to police, Waheed wanted to buy the weapon just to flaunt it.
