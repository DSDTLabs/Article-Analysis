ARA:   ( ) is holding its senate election on Monday after a gap of 10 years. The varsity has 17 constituent colleges spread over four districts of Bhojpur , Buxar , Rohtas and Kaimur .

 Vice-chancellor   said, “The election will be held to elect 11 senate members, out of which nine members will be from the teachers’ category, one member will be elected from the PG electoral body and one will be from non–teaching employees. The tenure of senate members is three years. But there are some senate members, whose term has expired six years back, but as no election was held, they continue to remain in the senate. There are also some members who have retired during the last 10 years.’’ 
 
 Dean student welfare (DSW)   said, “All preparation is complete for holding the senate election and polling booths have been set up in all the 17 constituent colleges and one at the university headquarters.”
 
 There are altogether 18 polling booths for teachers and 10 for the non-teaching employees. While 11 teachers are in the fray for five general category seats, eight candidates are trying their luck for the two OBC seats, two for the SC seat for teachers and only one for the ST seat, who is likely to be elected unopposed as there is no other candidate. For the PG seat, three candidates are in the fray, and five candidates are in the fray for one senate seat for non-teaching employees,’’ said the DSW. The result will be announced on Tuesday.
