NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the   forest department to ensure that two   delivered by the problem tigress T1 at   remain safe. 

 Taking cognisance of the TOI report on the birth of two cubs, the court granted 15 days to the department to verify if the newborns belong to the same tigress.
 
 In the last hearing, the court had asked the forest officials to capture the tigress after staying the shoot orders. Counsel  , appearing for the petitioner Dr  , argued that the animal cannot be tranquillized as the lives of the newly born cubs will be endangered.
 
 The counsel argued no incidents of   attacks on humans have been reported so there is no need to capture the animal. Stateâ€™s counsel argued that there was no evidence to establish whether the cubs belong to the problem tigress.
