Calangute: Deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo announced plans to make Calangute constituency, particularly Candolim and Calangute, garbage-free within six months even as slammed the tourism department for failing to clear garbage from the Calangute-Candolim beach belt. Large amounts of garbage have accumulated on the beach, he said. “All attempts to clear the garbage from the beach have failed. Garbage is not being collected for 5-6 days at a time. The previous garbage cleaning contractor was terminated because of corruption allegations in the Lok Ayukta and Drishti Lifesaving were given the responsibility and they have also failed,” he said at a press conference on Monday.  “Now the tourism department is going to come out with a fresh tender for garbage management of the beach. We will give them 30 days to clear the garbage on the beach. If they fail, the garbage collection money should instead be given to the village panchayat who can do a better job,” Lobo said in the presence of members of all four panchayats in Calangute constituency. Calangute sarpanch Anthony Menezes said if the tourism department fails to keep the beach clean, then all panch members would meet chief minister Manohar Parrikar and ask him to terminate the contract and give the money to the panchayats. “The village panchayats can handle this better as we're already collecting garbage from the village,” he said. Lobo added that the tourism department along with the Solid Waste Management Corporation (SWMC) should prepare a proper plan for clearing garbage from the beach. He said dustbins would be placed close to 50 metres from each other in the four villages of Candolim, Calangute, Parra and Arpora.
