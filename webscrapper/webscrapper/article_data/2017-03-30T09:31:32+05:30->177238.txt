SHIMLA: At a time when some politicians have questioned the credibility of   (EVMs) in the recently held assembly elections in five states, the Election Commission has decided to use the voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines attached to EVMs in byelection for Bhoranj assembly segment in Himachal Pradesh scheduled for April 9. VVPAT helps voters verify their choice of vote cast through EVMs.

 An official from state election department said once a voter   of his choice in the EVM, a printed paper containing the name of the selected candidate and poll symbol comes out so that he could verify it. He said that after the voter views the receipt, it goes inside a container linked to the EVM after seven seconds. He said VVPAT ensures the transparency in the entire election process.
 
 Bhoranj bypoll has become a prestige issue for both the BJP and Congress. BJP would be contesting not only to retain the seat which fell vacant following the demise of senior BJP leader and former education minister I D Dhiman in November last year, but also to launch its Mission 50 plus campaign. On the other hand, Congress would contest not only to reclaim the seat, but also to launch its ‘Mission Repeat’ with a victory right before assembly elections.
 
 So far, both the parties have not been able to launch the campaign with full force due to ensuing budget session of state assembly which would conclude on April 7, but sources said most likely the budget session would be cut short.
 
 The Congress list of star campaigner includes AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, Punjab chief minister  , deputy leader of opposition (Rajya Sabha) Anand Sharma, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh among others.
 
 The BJP’s list of star campaigners includes former chief minister and leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal, Kangra MP Shanta Kumar, Union health minister  , Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur among others.
