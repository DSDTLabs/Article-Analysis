He made a memorable debut in   as the antagonist in Shankar’s magnum opus with  , I. Now, after three years,   has signed on his next project here. He will be seen playing the villain in Kannan’s film with Atharvaa, which will go on floors this month.

 Confirming the news, the director says, “I met Upen in Mumbai last week and he was quite taken by the script. He is the ideal fit for the role and he was quite excited with the scope his character offers him. Upen told me that though he had been getting a lot of offers from the south industry, he hadn’t signed on any because they were all quite similar to what he had done before. Right now, we are finalising his looks and other details. I’m excited about the climax action sequence between him and Atharvaa.”
 
 The team will begin shooting from January 19 in Chennai.   adds, “Apart from Atharvaa, Megha Akash, Upen, RJ Balaji and Sathish, we’ve also roped in Suhasini ma’am (Maniratnam) for an important role.”
