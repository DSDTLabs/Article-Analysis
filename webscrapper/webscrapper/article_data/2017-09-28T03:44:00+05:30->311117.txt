Ponda: Following directives from the Ponda sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Ponda police on Wednesday booked Jharkhand native Manojkumar Singh on charges of culpable homicide of his wife. His wife, Anamika, succumbed to burn injuries in the couple’s rented room at Usgao last month. Ponda police said that Anamika, 19, was rushed to the Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim, where she died on August 15.

 During the inquiry, the deceased’s mother, Savitridevi, told the SDM that her son-in-law was harassing her daughter to buy him a motorcycle through funding from her parents. She expressed her suspicion that her daughter could have set herself ablaze.
