GURUGRAM: A city   on Monday rejected the   application of a 16-year-old boy, accused of murdering a seven-year-old child of a prominent school in Gurugram. This is the third time the juvenile’s bail application has been declined since he was taken into custody by CBI in November last year. He’s currently lodged in a Faridabad remand facility.

 The boy’s lawyers, Satya Paul Gupta and  , moved the bail application in the court of additional sessions judge JS Kundu on the ground that the CBI has failed to conclude its investigation within the prescribed limit of 60 days. But the court dismissed the plea, saying the stage was not fit for granting bail.
 
 “The   deserves to be given the benefit of compulsive bail as the CBI has failed to conclude the investigation within the statutory limitation of 60 days. The prescribed period of 60 days has expired long back but the agency had failed to furnish the chargesheet in the court and thus the juvenile has become entitled for bail,” the lawyers argued.
 
 However, the CBI counsel countered, saying, there is no time limit of 60 days for completion of investigation in case of heinous crimes. “Graver the offence, the more time to collect the incriminating evidence which has to be provided for conducting a fair trial,” the counsel argued.
 
 The bail plea submission was also opposed by advocate Sushil Tekriwal, appearing for the seven-year old victim, saying “it’s devoid of any merit”.
 
 On January 8 also, the court rejected the bail plea of the juvenile and imposed a fine of Rs 21,000 on his father for wasting its precious time. The Juvenile Justice Board had also rejected the bail plea of the boy in December last year before passing an order to treat him as an adult.
