On Thursday afternoon, workers were busy decking up the replica of a peacock, and arranging flower pots to create stunning thematic structures. The glasshouse saw the 30 ft replica of   being decked up with tons of fresh flowers brought from across the country. A vertical garden was also being constructed to make people aware of the possibility of gardening even in small urban spaces. The park, especially the pillars, gleamed under a fresh coat of silver paint.
