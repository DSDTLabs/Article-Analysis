GAYA: Illegal sand   continues unabated in the   under Barachatti police station area in the district. If sources are to be believed, about 2,500 tonnes of sand is illegally mined in the river every day. The sand is then dumped in nearby areas falling in Jharkhand.

 Sand mining is not allowed in the   river for ecological reasons. However, sources alleged the uncontrolled plundering of sand by the mafia in the Bhalua riverbed has the backing of local police. There is no authorised sand mining point in the Barachatti police station area and local sand users have to get it either from Dobhi or Mohanpur police station areas.
 
  SSP Garima Malik said though complaints of illegal mining have come from several parts of the district, no specific complaint has been received from the Barachatti police station area. “All complaints of illegal sand mining have been taken very seriously. A junior police officer has been suspended in this connection,” Malik said.
 
 She added the police would probe reports of illegal sand mining in the Bhalua river. “Stern action will be taken against those involved in sand quarrying. Even the policemen will not be spared if they are found guilty of hobnobbing with the sand mafia,” the SSP added.
