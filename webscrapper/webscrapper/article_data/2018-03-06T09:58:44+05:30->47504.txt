GORAKHPUR: It is 9pm and   is holding a meeting with her team at the party headquarters. The   candidate for

  seems unfazed at the announcement of BSP support to SP candidate.
 
 “This will be a triangular fight. SP has fielded a weak candidate and even within Nishads, there is no consensus on the party they will support. I do not see any en bloc voting for anyone,” says Dr Kareem, who has a close connection with Lucknow.
 
 Her father was in UP Police and Kareem completed her senior Cambridge from Loreto Convent Lucknow in 1974. “I have been in Gorakhpur since the last 30 years and active in Congress since 2002 when my husband and I joined the party. Both of us are doctors and people here recognise my contribution to society,” she says. Kareem contested the mayoral elections in 2012 and lost by about 20,000 votes. This time, support has been building for her on her alma mater groups with messages about her candidature circulating on social media.
 
 At present, not only does she have to deal with popular support for BJP and chief minister  , she is also trying to dismiss rumours that Congress will support the SP candidate Praveen Nishad. Praveen Nishad’s father and Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad told TOI that Congress is acting as a front for SP. “Congress will ensure that voters unhappy with SP for any reason will move to them and not go to BJP. It was a deliberate move to give the Congress ticket to a Muslim candidate,” Nishad said. Laughing at this claim, Kareem said she would be more than happy to get SP’s votes.
 
 “See, if one were to go by candidate, Congress has the best. However, Congress cannot match up with BJP in money power. Irrespective of what anyone is claiming, the votes that were to go to SP and BSP will not come to us. Congress is battling this out on its own,” she said.
