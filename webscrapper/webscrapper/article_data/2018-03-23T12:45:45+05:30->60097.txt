Sameer informs the family that Karan and Preeta are returning home and tells Rishabh about the same. Sherlyn thinks that Prithvi would seek revenge from Karan and Preeta anyhow. She eagerly waits for the drama to unfold. Preeta asks Prithvi where he had been. Prithvi stops her and questions where had they been the entire night. He doubts her character. Preeta gets shocked and says that they were actually looking for him. Karan gets annoyed after Sherlyn too sides Prithvi. Karan has an argument with Sherlyn but Kareena scolds him and questions Preeta as to why she was with Karan all night. She doesnâ€™t even let Sarla interfere. Preeta explains that she went to look out for Prithvi.  Sarla assures Karan that she trusts him as much as she trusts her daughter. Karan tells Prithvi and the entire family of how Preeta wanted to go look for Prithvi after he left angrily.
