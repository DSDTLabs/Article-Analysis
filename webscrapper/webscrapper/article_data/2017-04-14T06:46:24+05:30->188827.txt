THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   commission has recommended the government to bring in a legislation to make all hospitals, including those in the  , to set up   cameras in ICUs, and operation theatres. 

 The recommendation, intended to bring in transparency in hospital procedures, was made on a petition that sought the attention of the government, especially senior officials of the health and local self-government departments.
 
 Petitioner Dr   said that "when a patient is admitted to a hospital he/she and his/her relatives think that the patients are safe in the hands of medical experts. But the reality is that they are really looted by the hospital authorities."
 
 The petition further said that a patient was treated in secrecy. "What happens inside the hospital, namely operation theatre, intensive care unit, post-operative ward, etc is not known to the relatives. Atrocities are committed in some of the leading hospitals where even a dead patient is charged for the operation and ventilator charges'', the petitioner said, adding that the relatives were often handed over a hefty bill.
 
 Dr Bhaskar asked the commission to ensure that the patient and bystanders and relatives were made of the treatment. "This can be ensured by making a new enactment," he said.
 
 Right commission acting chairperson   noted that the allegation were made by an experienced doctor. Reports of deaths due to negligence were not rare.
 
 "Hence, I hereby direct the secretary to health, revenue, LSGI and the chief secretary to bestow their special attention in the matter and file a report. The reports shall be filed within one month," he said.
