JOHANNESBURG: With debutant  , the man of the match in Centurion, not making South Africa feel the loss of   so far, it's their fast bowling that'll once again look to corner India and clinch the series 3-0 at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.

 
 
 Kagiso Rabada, Lungi's senior by a year and once his under-19 teammate, is waiting for Monday to arrive when work begins again. "Actually cricket's off my mind at the moment, we're having some fun right now," he says.
 
 
 
 The young man has earned it. Along with Ngidi, the duo became the first black South African bowlers to pick all the wickets in an innings of a Test match. That calls for celebration indeed.
 
 He's happy for Ngidi and says it was "special" bowling with him at Centurion. "We played together in the under-19. We even toured India I remember, but he got injured unfortunately and his trip was cut short. But we played together at school and we have a history. So it's just nice to play with your friend, from when you were a teenager. So hopefully long may it continue, and we can form a great partnership. I know he has enjoyed bowling with the likes of   and   as well," said the No. 1 ranked bowler.
 
 When the time comes for Johannesburg to be in focus, Rabada says he'll be ready. "We'll have a look at the pitch. We'll have a good training session. We've played here (at the Wanderers) lots and we know how the conditions behave," he said.
 
 The 22-year-old is not discounting India despite the series having been decided. He remembers well how close India came to clinching the Wanderers Test back in 2013. "India played really well here the last time they were here and Kohli got a hundred.
 
 "Wanderers is a good wicket, it's normally a moving wicket. There's always a result. It's a pitch where if you bat well you can score some runs, and if you bowl well you'll take wickets. You're sort of never really 'in' on that pitch. Let's see what is to come. The fast bowlers are excited to bowl," Rabada said.
