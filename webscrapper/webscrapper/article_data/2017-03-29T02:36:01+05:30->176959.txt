The   has decided to do away with the penalty imposed on   on unauthorized residential flats measuring 600 sqft or less. Earlier, the   would collect twice the property tax from such flats.

 According to a government resolution, unauthorized properties measuring between 601 and 1,000 sqft will have to pay 50% more property tax as penalty and those measuring more than 1,001 sqft area will have to pay 100% more tax. The new rates will be effective from April 1 this year. 
 
 “People often purchase houses and shops from builders not knowing that they have been illegally constructed. A penalty is charged from the buyers for no fault of theirs,” said J N Patil, a senior official in the state urban development department, on Monday.
 
 The BMC too levies a 200% penalty on flat owners in illegal structures. “A need for such a decision was felt considering that the occupier of the property was not responsible for the structure being illegal in nature and therefore, there was always a question on why should they pay the penalty,” said a civic official. 
 
 The revenue collected through property tax in this financial year so far has been Rs 4,000 crore. The BMC is racing against time to meet its target of Rs 5,200 crore considering last year the revenue from property tax was Rs 4,900 crore.
 
 “This is good news for flat owners who are suffering because of the mistakes of the builders. The state’s move will safeguard the interest of the common people,” Pune mayor Mukta Tilak said.
 
 But a few activists feel the move may provide relief to builders who have been deliberately involved in unauthorized construction. 
 
 “The government should make a provision to punish those who construct unauthorized buildings. The buyers should not be asked to bear the additional penalty; the builders should be penalized,” said Vivek Velankar, founder of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.
