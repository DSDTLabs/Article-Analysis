NOIDA: The   (NTC), which conducted a detailed survey of the 24-km Noida-Greater Noida expressway to rectify infrastructural lapses and improve road safety, has suggested a few steps to make the ride smoother on the high-speed expressway. 

 “The suggestions include creation of a rotary at the intersection near Sector 108. Secondly, a curved road from the expressway near Sector 93 towards Dadri road needs to be closed as it is very dangerous. Third, a central verge at 45-metre road near Sector 108 should be closed and two U-turns built at the point for smooth flow of traffic,” said Sandeep Chandra, traffic cell incharge,  . 
 
 “We have also suggested several low-cost techniques which will further smoothen traffic flow. However, a detailed work on rectifying the infrastructure of the e-way will be carried out only after the assembly elections and once the   (CRRI) submits its report,” he added. A report from the   regarding improvements for the road connecting the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida is awaited, officials told.
 
 Earlier, Deepak Agarwal, CEO, Noida Authority, had pointed out that the entry and exit points from the expressway are random and poorly designed. “Since the opening of the expressway in 2002, several haphazard ingress and egress points have been created along the both sides of the road, which are dangerous for commuters,” said Agarwal. “The designs at some points along the expressway are also not as per the laid down norms for road safety and engineering,” he explained. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Chandra said: “We have found that the four entry and exit points along both carriageways of the e-way are regular and needed. In addition, there is one exit from the e-way near Sector 105 and another entry to the expressway from Sector 125, which are also necessary for commuters,” he added.
