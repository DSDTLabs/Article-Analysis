Ludhiana: A group of miscreants allegedly attacked the residents of Bihari Colony on Tajpur Road late on Friday evening, when the latter stopped the former from creating a nuisance in the area by promoting drugs.

 According to residents, a group of youths sit in an abandoned plot in the area, consume drugs, and create nuisance in the locality. Earlier too, residents had tried to stop them, but to no avail. On Friday, Jai Prakash (55) and two neighbours reached the plot and stopped the youths from promoting drugs in the area. At that time, the youths fled from there, but by late evening, they returned with their accomplices and barged into the house of Jai Prakash, who alleged that the youths thrashed him and his family with sticks and rods, before fleeing from there.
 
 On informing the police, cops from Tajpur Road reached the spot, visited the abandoned plot, and recovered some liquor bottles and syringes lying there. Investigating officer Resham Singh said the police had received a complaint, and an FIR would be lodged after the probe.
