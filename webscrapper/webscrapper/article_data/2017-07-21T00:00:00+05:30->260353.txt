When he played the tough-yet-lovable bike race coach years ago in Bangalore Days,   wouldn’t have imagined that the character would pave the way for many other roles, that too not just in Mollywood. 

 The ad filmmaker-cum-actor, who has already acted in three South Indian industries, has now stepped into Bollywood in style! In the upcoming Sidharth Malhothra -   movie A Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky; Sijoy plays a RAW official named Ramachandra Rao. The film is helmed by director duo Raj and D.K.
 
 Sijoy recalls, “I met Raj and D.K on the sets of Bangalore Days’ Tamil version Bangalore Naatkal, in Hyderabad. They are friends of Rana Daggubati.” Speaking about his character, the actor reveals, “I am a RAW official in the movie, and work mostly in disguise. In fact, a glance at me would make people wonder whether I belong to the underworld,” says Sijoy, in jest. Apparently, he gives out a gangster feel so that it is easier to collect the required information. “Ramachandra Rao is a Tamilian, who is a smart, intelligent officer who goes to any extend to get his job done. My character is chasing after Sidharth’s,” Sijoy says. 
 
 How was it working in Bollywood? Sijoy says, “I loved it. Not only did I feel respected and also satisfied with my work, the disciplined, planned out execution of the film was also quite impressive. No last minute corrections in terms of costumes or dialogues. Sidharth, who has many fans, is pretty chilled out and fun to work with.” The movie was mostly shot in Miami, Thailand and Mumbai. Sunil Shetty also plays a notable role in the movie. 
 In Malayalam, Sijoy has Syamdhar’s Mammootty film, an upcoming Tovino project and Anil Radhakrishna Menon’s Diwanjimoola Grand Prix coming up in a few months.
