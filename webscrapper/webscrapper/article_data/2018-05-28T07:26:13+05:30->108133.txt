MUMBAI: It is not just builders who derail projects. The Bombay HC recently found that a bank played a “collusive” role to try and deprive property buyers their rights. The HC pulled up the   for, prima facie, colluding with a builder to create a mortgage in its favour in a case where 300 shop buyers have waited for over five years for property possession; some had made bookings about a decade ago.

 
 Justice S J   restrained the SBI from seeking to exercise any right in its favour over the alleged mortgage, created in 2012 by the developer,  .
 
 The property, an industrial unit in  , caused gala buyers “sleepless nights” as the bank had moved the   (NCLT) to declare the builder insolvent and get rights to the prime land to recover a Rs40crore loan, based on a mortgage. But in a relief to the buyers, who had moved court, Justice Kathawalla held that the NCLT lacks jurisdiction to hear the bank’s plea when shop buyers have alleged fraud in mortgage creation.
 
 “It appears, prima facie, that the SBI was also involved in the creation of a sham mortgage facility,” said the HC, based on “expired documents”. The judge agreed with Janak Dwarkadas, counsel for the buyers, that the mortgage is “invalid”.
