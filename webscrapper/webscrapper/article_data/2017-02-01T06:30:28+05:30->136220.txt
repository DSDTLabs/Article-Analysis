GANDHINAGAR: A day ahead of the NDA government's   2017, the   expressed concerns and demanded that Gujarat not face injustice from the central government like in last year's budget. Congress also demanded a complete waiver of farm loans, sops for MSMEs and other industries.

 Bharatsinh Solanki, Gujarat Congress president said: “When Gujarat CM   took over as PM, BJP claimed it will be like “mother serving food at one's maternal grandparents' home“ but in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the central allocation to Gujarat was drastically , reduced by around Rs 7,500 crore. We hope Gujarat will not face in justice in the 2017-18 budget, like last year.“
 
 Solanki said: “By merging the railway budget and general budget, the NDA government is likely to mislead people with jugglery . Earlier they claimed 8% GDP growth but now RBI has accepted that growth will not be more than 7% while many rating agencies have estimate a decline in growth rate by between 1% and 3% in 2017-18.“
 
 “Fiscal deficit has gone out of control. Congress waived farmers loans while BJP has just waived interest on it. We demand a complete waiver of farm loans. We expect that the BJP-led NDA government increase the exemption limit from present Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per annum and take steps to help the poor and middle class,“ Solanki added.
 
 Shankersinh Vaghela, leader of opposition in the state assembly , said: “When the Union government claims that the merger of railway budget and general budget will help the poor and middle class, the government must reduce railway fares and other prices. Government should reduce services tax, excise and other taxes on petrol, diesel and other products to give relief to the common people. After demonetization around 1 crore people have their lost jobs. There must be incentives to restore these jobs.“
