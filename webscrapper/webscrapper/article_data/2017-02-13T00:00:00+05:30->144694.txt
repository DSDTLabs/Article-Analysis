Take a stroll along the lakeside area of the   and a riot of colours welcome you. On a closer examination you will realise that these are no ordinary garden décor but made out of recycled materials — seats made of tyres, flowerbeds made of used bottles, and an old boat painted with bright colours. 

 The brains behind the innovative park are the students of the college who made use of their leisure time after their classes to come up with a recreational space in the college.
  Antony John Joseph, from the department of Economics, who has been part of the team who worked on the park says, “We were thinking of how to recycle the materials in the college premises in an efficient way, when this idea dawned upon us.” What they came up with was Kadavu, a park near the lakeside that would provide a space to relax and enjoy the scenery.
 
  The young minds made use of everything they could find from old tyres, marble pieces, coconut shells, used bottles and glasses to even bottle caps.
 Ajin Joy, chairperson of the college, says, “Our main purpose was to make better use of the junk around. But to our surprise we found that a lot of amazing things could be made out of the materials.”
 
 When other students came to know of the plan, many came up with innovative ideas to be part of the project.
 Antony says, “While some of our efforts went in vain, others became an instant hit. Within three weeks starting from January first week, we came up with the park.”
 
 The park has been garnering wide attention not only inside the campus but from outside as well. Actor Nivin Pauly, who came to the college for one of their culture fests, was all praise for the park. Similarly, artist Bose Krishnamachari too visited it and lauded the work.”
  Tom Jose, a second year B Com student, who is one of the masterminds behind the project, says, “We have even created a snake and ladder table, where students can de-stress.” Expressing his happiness with the outcome, he adds that a lot of his college mates are making use of it these days.
  Ajin and friends say that up next they plan to put up a swing there. Meanwhile, the students are also thinking of utilising the park to the maximum by mooting for open classrooms near the lake.
