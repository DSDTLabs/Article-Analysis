Eminent artist  , who showcased his artworks recently in city, takes time out for a quick chat with Hyderabad Times.

 
 Isn’t that a game we all grow up playing, and continue to play? as we grow up, the lemon and spoon are replaced by other things, as we strive to achieve a balance while continuing our race. In my paintings, I replaced the lemon with an egg as it signifies new life and new beginnings. These works also represent my own journey as an artist, but my concept is universal and is relevant to everyone. 
 
 
 Travel and people. I have travelled to various countries during my artistic endeavours... From Venice to  , I realised, people are similar everywhere... 
 
 
  has won the silver for us in an international arena, and even the movie industry is making waves globally, but somehow when it comes to art, we are still lagging behind. I believe that there has to be a mechanism for Hyderabad’s art to spread out to the world and a means to allow our artists to showcase their work globally. For instance, I am a practising artist, but I continue to get trained from artists world over so that I can be part of the global art scene.
