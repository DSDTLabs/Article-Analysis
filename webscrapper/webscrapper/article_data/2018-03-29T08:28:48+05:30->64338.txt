HYDERABAD: Keeping with the growing demand in the housing sector, at least 10,000-15,000 new homes have been launched in Hyderabad over the last 14 months, say industry sources. The only catch: none of them are registered and thus, ineligible for being marketed or sold.

 This, courtesy the prolonged delay in setting up of the   (RERA) by the government that had implemented the central RERA Act, in  , in August last year. While it made it mandatory for every project, launched on and after January 1, 2017, to be officially green-signalled by the authority, the regulatory body is still far from being conceived.
 
 “It is not economically viable for developers to hold onto projects for so long. Many have, therefore, submitted applications with the ad-hoc committee in place right now, assuring to comply with the RERA norms, and started work on the ground. The progress, though, is very slow,” said a representative of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (CREDAI-Hyderabad), claiming that the count – of fresh housing units – could be even 20,000 or more. The dilemma facing Ashwin   of Manbhum Constructions is much the same. While his firm too has begun work on its project in Whitefields, Kondapur, it hasn’t still been ‘formally’ launched. “We have given them all suitable documentation and plans. But we cannot wait eternally; so, we are going ahead with construction,” said Rao.
 
 Analysts fear that this delay might come as a blow to not just developers but also home buyers, with a thinning stock pushing the price of houses further upwards.
