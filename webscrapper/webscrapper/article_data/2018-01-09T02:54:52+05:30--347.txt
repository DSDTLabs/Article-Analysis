NEW DELHI: Justice  , who as the chief justice of Delhi HC had in 2009 given a judgment decriminalising   between consenting adults in private, said the decision of the   to refer the issue to a larger bench was due, considering that the nine-judge Constitution bench on the privacy order had already favoured freedom of individual’s sexual orientation.

 Speaking to TOI, Justice Shah said a curative petition, against the SC verdict striking down the Delhi HC order in 2013, is already pending before a five-judge bench and Monday’s decision of the SC to refer the matter to a larger bench will possibly be heard together by the same bench.
 
 “The observations of the nine-judge bench are very clear which had declared citizen’s right to privacy, including individual’s right to sexual orientation, as part of fundamental rights,” Shah said, adding that it is most likely the five-judge bench will not go against the nine-judge bench.
 
 The nine-judge bench on the privacy issue had found “sexual orientation an essential attribute of privacy” and any discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation as deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual.
