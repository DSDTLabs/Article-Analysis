Mumbai: The adjudication authority on Monday cross examined former   president   in connection with transfer of funds from India to South Africa in 2009 for the   (IPL) without mandatory permission from the   (RBI). 

 
 
 It is alleged that in 2009, BCCI transferred foreign exchange equivalent to Rs 243 crore into the account of Cricket South Africa (CSA) in South Africa to organise IPL tournament there. 
 
 In 2009, Shashank Manohar was the president of BCCI and N Srinivasan the secretary (he took over as president in 2011). Lalit Modi was, at that time, the vice-president of the BCCI alongside being appointed the commissioner of IPL.
 
 During the cross examination proceedings on Monday, Srinivasan’s representative read out his earlier statement where he had mentioned that Modi was also part of the decision-making process related with the transfer of the funds, said a source.
 
  Srinivasan also said that he was just following the instruction of than BCCI president (Manohar) and the cricket board’s working committee. Both Srinivasan and Manohar declined comment.
 
 Modi’s lawyer Mehmood Abdi said: “During the proceeding, Srinivasan tried to put the entire blame on Shashank stating that he was chief functionary of BCCI and everyone was working under him. Shashank is blaming Srinivasan. Modi was not involved in the financial decision-making process of the board or shifting of the IPL matches.”
