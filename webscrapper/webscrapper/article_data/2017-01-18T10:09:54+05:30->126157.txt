LUCKNOW: With chief minister   replacing his father   on the   throne as its national president and an SP-Congress alliance in the offing, the political spotlight is back on BSP chief   for whom the   would determine her very political existence.

 On Tuesday, even as the SP camp drew out a roadmap for an alliance, Mayawati called up a group of close party ranks from west UP to strategise her campaign in the region where she has fielded Muslim candidates in significant numbers.
 
 Sources said the BSP supremo not only ascertained the party's preparation, she also sought feedback on the impact of unprecedented development in the SP camp in the region, especially on the Muslim electorate which has been siding significantly with the Samajwadi Party . Sources said the meeting, lasting for more than an hour, saw Mayawati being detailed on the collective perception of the minority community vis-a-vis BSP and its main rival SP, which is now seeking an alliance with the Congress.
 
 Mayawati is learnt to have directed her cadre to carry on with their campaign, away from media attention, besides speeding up preparations for her rallies expected to start from Meerut and Aligarh from February 1. Party sources said Mayawati is likely to address more than a dozen rallies in west UP .
 
 Keen to play the Dalit-Muslim consolidation card, Mayawati has decided to field 97 Muslim candidates, of whom more than 36 will be from western UP . Mayawati is eyeing a strong Muslim vote share through a direct fight with the BJP in the west UP by placing herself squarely against the saffron outfit.
