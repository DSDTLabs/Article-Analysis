KOLKATA: The alleged murder case of Dakshineshwar's engineering student   took a new turn on Wednesday after the final post-mortem report revealed strangulation marks.

 Police said a number of persons could have been involved in the murder. They suspect that a dispute over an illicit affair with a married woman could have led to the murder. 
 
 According to police sources, a couple and a girl known to the victim are being questioned in this connection. 
 
 Deep's decomposed body was found floating in a pond adjacent to the   police housing complex off BT Road on January 6 after he had gone missing from a New Year party in the complex on December 31.
 
 Police on Wednesday said the victim was thrashed before being strangulated. "Some injury marks were also found on his face and chest in the post-mortem report. We suspect he was assaulted and strangled to death before being dumped in the pond," the officer said.
 
 During investigation, police found that Barik had gone to a park in Hooghly's   with a married woman on December 31. "Prima facie it appears that he had developed a relationship with a jewellery trader's wife. He also had a tiff with the trader over phone on December 31 when he found out about their Chandernagore trip. Later in the evening, Sanjay   who was arrested earlier called Barik to the New Year party," the officer said.
 
 The trader, his wife and a girl who was in a close relationship with Barik are now being questioned.
