Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) has started the process to regularize unauthorized constructions, layouts and plots. General body is set to fix a window of six months during which regularization will be done.

 Mayor Nanda Jichkar has summoned a meeting of general body on January 20 at Town Hall in Mahal. Nine general body questions will come up for discussion. One pending and 10 policy decision-making proposals will also be tabled before the House for discussion.
 
 One of the proposals is related to regularization of unauthorized constructions, layouts and plots. The state government had launched a special scheme to regularize unauthorized constructions, layouts and plots cropped up on or before December 31, 2015. As per the scheme, the civic body has to fix a time frame of six months in which applications are to be received followed by regularization.
 
 As per the proposal, the NMC will recover non-refundable scrutiny charges of Rs5,000 from the applicants. Charges, to be finalized by the general body, will be recovered from the applicants. A large number of unauthorized constructions are likely to be regularized under the scheme.
 
 Already, the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has started regularization process in areas coming under its jurisdiction.
 
 Another important proposal before the general body is to distribute ownership rights to eligible slum-dwellers in seven localities — Rambagh, Borkar Nagar, Bansod Mohalla, Gujar Nagar, Mehtarpura, Sudarshan Nagar and Takiya. The ownership rights will be distributed after recovering charges from the eligible slum-dwellers.
 
 A proposal to make it mandatory to attach updated property tax receipts while registering sale deeds of properties has been tabled before the general body. The proposal will be submitted to the state government after general body’s consent. The motive behind the proposal is to recover huge arrears pending on open plots.
