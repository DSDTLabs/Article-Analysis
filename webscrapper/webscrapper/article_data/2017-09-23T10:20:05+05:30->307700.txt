MUMBAI: At a time when administrative tussles have robbed cricket of its charm and romance in India, this was a poignant moment.

 On a sultry Friday afternoon, the iconic Cricket Club of India ( ), which is no more a member of the   (BCCI), paid the best-possible tribute to perhaps its most valuable member, former   president and a self-confessed “cricket tragic”  , by naming its main gate after him. The idea was mooted by none other than one of 'Raj bhai's' largesse's major beneficiaries, batting legend  , back in 2009.
 
 Apparently, Tendulkar had mooted the idea in a condolence meeting after Dungarpur's death, for which he had turned up just a day after returning from Sri Lanka. He had also dedicated his century in an ODI Tri-series final he had scored in Colombo, to Dungarpur.
 
 “He was the life of CCI. I requested this (naming the gate after him) in 2009. Thank you for making it happen,” said Tendulkar, who was the special invitee for the occasion. Paying rich tributes to the ex-India chief selector, the retired great said: “It was always a joy to see Raj bhai full of energy and enthusiasm. Raj Bhai was no less than a guru to all youngsters. He was the heart of CCI.”
 
 Recalling 'Raj bhai's' contribution in the early part of his career, the retired maestro said: “When it comes to Raj bhai, I really don't know where to start because I get confused. We had that kind of a relationship. He has guided me all the way.
 
 “In fact, the first time when Raj bhai saw me was when I was 13 or 14. I had scored some runs against CCI, while playing for Shivaji Park Youngsters. At that time, Raj bhai told me to play for CCI and bent all possible rules and allowed me to get in the dressing room at the age of 14,” he said. “Raj bhai always helped youngsters. I'm the lucky one. There were occasions where I had to go on foreign tours. One did not have deep pockets then. Raj bhai was instrumental in getting the sponsors to make sure that I get that experience.”
