AGRA: The   (NGT) on Thursday issued notice to an Aligarh-based slaughterhouse for discarding animal carcass and blood in a nearby drain. Replies have also been sought from district magistrate   and UP pollution control board, among others, in the matter. The district authorities had earlier given an affidavit in the tribunal saying they will not allow any slaughterhouse to run without prior permission under the Water and Air Act.
 
  The court was hearing a petition filed by Delhi-based environmentalist Shailesh Singh against the slaughterhouse situated at   under Koal tehsil of Aligarh. Singh had alleged that presence of the slaughterhouse was not only causing environmental pollution but had also made the lives of people living nearby miserable.
  
  “The slaughterhouse discarded animal parts in the drain. We sought an inspection by the NGT but the tribunal clarified that there was no need for it since the photographs and videos that were submitted clearly showed the condition of nearby areas. The court then directed the slaughterhouse’s owner and district authorities to file their replies within two weeks,” said Singh.
  
  He also said that by not taking any action against the erring slaughterhouse, authorities were abetting its illegal acts.
  
  In October last year, the district authorities had told NGT that no slaughterhouse will be allowed to operate in the state without having permission under the Water and Air Act, especially in areas such as Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Sambhal and Aligarh.
