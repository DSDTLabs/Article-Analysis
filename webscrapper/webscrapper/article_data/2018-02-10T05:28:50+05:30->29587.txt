MUMBAI:The   recently arrested a foreign national for allegedly paying   to a   officer to clear his consignment through a chartered accountant. 

 The Japanese national allegedly told interrogators he was not aware it was a bribe and he had been misled by the CA. 
 
 However, the CA scotched his claims. All the three accused are in judicial custody. The CBI is inquiring if the CA and Customs officer had teamed up earlier too. Police said Takashi Kuroda was held while he was giving Rs 2 lakh bribe to assistant commissioner of customs, Kalicharan Panda. CA Sanjeev Malhotra was also present. 
 
 Panda allegedly demanded the bribe to clear Kuroda’s consignment. Takashi is a director in Mumbai-based Hope (India) Diamond Trading Company. The CBI learnt about the deal through technical surveillance and arrested the accused red-handed. 
 
 An officer said, “Kuroda was trying to shift blame on the CA stating he had been misled. But, it’s irrelevant as the
 CA has stated Kuroda was aware of the deal.” 
 
 Kuroda applied for bail through advocate Satish Maneshinde. In his bail plea, Kuroda told the court he had been falsely implicated and there was no evidence to show he had handed the bribe to Panda. 
 
 His bail plea states the trap at Panda’s office was laid without any reliable information or proof of demand of illegal gratification or proper investigation of information.
 
 The plea also said Kuroda had been living in the city for five years with his family. He has said nothing incriminating was found by the investigating agency during searches. Advocate for Panda, Ashish Chavan submitted there was no evidence to connect him to cash recovered at his office. 
 
 The prosecution strongly opposed the pleas on the grounds that the investigation was at a primary stage and granting relief to the accused would hamper investigation. Hearing in the case has been adjourned to Tuesday when the court may pronounce order on the bail pleas.
