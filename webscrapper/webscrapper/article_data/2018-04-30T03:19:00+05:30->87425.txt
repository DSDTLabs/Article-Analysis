Margao: The Benaulim gram sabha held on Sunday extended support to Goencho Avaaz, spearheading the movement to oppose the regional plan 2021. Voicing their disagreement over conversion of vast tracts of green areas into settlement zones, villagers demanded that the plan be scrapped and a new one be formulated in consultation with all stakeholders.  The gram sabha also expressed opposition to the draft notification issued by the directorate of panchayats that gram sabhas should not discuss matters that are not listed in the agenda. Members also objected to the proposal that gram sabhas should begin at 11am, on the grounds that it would only delay the proceedings. Currently, the meetings start by 10am.  While concerns were raised over the large number of illegal structures in the village, the panchayat said it would initiate action against kiosks by issuing show cause notices to owners. The kiosks have been set up in areas where road widening work was being done.  Members were informed that the panchayat had collected the largest amount of waste in South Goa.
