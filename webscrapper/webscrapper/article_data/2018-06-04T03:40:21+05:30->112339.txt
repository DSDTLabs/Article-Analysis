MUMBAI: A five-year-old girl, Prapti Patil, who was on a picnic with her family at   on Friday, drowned in the   inside a  .

 The Arnala coastal police have registered a case of accidental death. While the parents have not filed a case of negligence against the resort, the police said that the resort owners and staffers will be questioned. There was no   or even a staffer posted at the pool. 
 
 On Friday, the Patils, who live in Narangi in Virar, went to Arnala beach along with relatives for a picnic. After spending the day on the beach, around 5pm, Prapti’s father Naresh approached Nisarg Resort, located near the beach, for permission to freshen up. The staffers allowed the group to use the washrooms for a fee.
 
 While some members of the family were in the washroom, Naresh, his wife and Prapti entered the swimming pool on the resort premises. None of the staffers saw them get into the pool, Naresh told the police. He claimed that while they were frolicking in the water, Prapti came down the slide and before they could catch her, she slipped through their hands and went under the water. Her parents managed to get an unconscious Prapti out of the pool and tried to resuscitate her. The staffers were alerted and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was declared ‘brought dead’ by the doctors. 
 
 The resort has two adult pools and one for children. Prapti and her parents were in one of the adult pools. 
 
 During summer vacation, picnickners from Mumbai and Thane often throng Arnala beach, which is lined with resorts. Most of the resorts do not have certified lifeguards at their pools, said police officials.
