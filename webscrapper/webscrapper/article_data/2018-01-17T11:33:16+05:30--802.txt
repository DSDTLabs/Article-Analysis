PUNE: The workers’ union of   ( ) is mulling over taking legal action against the transport facility for sacking 158 drivers working on daily wage.

 The PMPML officials defended the move, stating that the action was taken because of gross absenteeism, but the office-bearers of the   (Intuc), with 7,000 members, will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday.
 
 “How can the PMPML sack so many employees at one go? We are talking to the lawyers and had a meeting with them on Monday. We plan to take legal action against the PMPML and further action will be decided in Tuesday’s meeting,” said  , the president of the union.
 
 After   was appointed the chairman and managing director of the transport body, more than 200 drivers and other staffers, including senior employees, have been dismissed. Many were suspended, too. “On Monday, we had planned a protest in front of the PMPML office but the authorities stopped us. They are just trying to suppress our voice,” Kharade said.
 
 “We are not thinking about going on a strike at this moment. We are not saying that PMPML shouldn’t take action against those at fault. But the sacking of so many employees at a time doesn’t make sense at all,” Kharade said.
 
 PMPML public relations officer   told TOI, “The dismissal letters were served on the daily wage drivers on Monday. According to the regulations, they have to be present on duty for at least 22 days in a month. It was found that there was gross absenteeism. New drivers are being recruited to replace them.”
 
 The maximum number of drivers sacked belonged to the Hadapsar depot (28), followed by Tanaji wadi (18). At present, the PMPML has a total of 2,545 drivers.
