The makers of the south remakes of   have roped in popular choreographer Caesar Gonsalves, of the   duo, for their versions of the London Thumakada song.  , who is playing the lead in the Kannada version,  , which she is also co-producing, was instrumental in getting him onboard. Since Bosco-Caesar had worked on the original, Parul wanted them to work on the south films as well. “Caesar will choreograph the ‘Wedding Song’ in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu. We wanted the setting to be as authentic as possible, so, instead of having professional dancers on set, we have got 150 junior artistes for the shoot. All three versions will be shot in   shortly,” says Parul.
But considering that south Indian weddings are vastly different from those up north, what kind of preparation has Caesar been doing? “I am not entirely unfamiliar with south Indian traditions as my wife is of Tamil-Telugu descent. Moreover, I have worked in south Indian films earlier. The makers of the Queen remakes also shared a bunch of candid wedding videos to give me a clear picture so that I can plan each version differently. They have also translated the lyrics of the songs for me. The three songs will be different, with glimpses of local rituals, etc.,” says Caesar, who will join the team in early April.
