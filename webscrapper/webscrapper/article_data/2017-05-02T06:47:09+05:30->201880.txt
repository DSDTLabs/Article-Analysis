NAGPUR: Reliance Foundation (RF) along with district administration on Monday launched a service that will provide free   to over 1.5 lakh   in Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts on their mobiles. This is part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project of Reliance group.

 The facility was launched by Nagpur guardian minister   and district collector Sachin Kurve. “Voice messages are based on information handed over to the foundation by the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) and the other institutions under the   (ICAR). We are only providing technology to reach it to the farmers,” said Dhamdeep Gondane, assistant programme officer of RF.
 
 The messages will be released every day around 6pm and will have information on cultivation practices, animal husbandry, weather, government schemes related to agriculture etc. “We have a list of 1.5 lakh farmers, taluka wise from the state agriculture department. Hence those not covered under the project should get in touch with the taluka agriculture officer and register there to avail the facility. Reaching crop insurance information details in simplest possible manner is also one of the target areas for the foundation,” said Gondane. 
 
 The project plans to rope in various technical experts too to make the advisory more accurate and reliable. The project has already been implemented in certain   districts like Wardha, Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana, Washim and Amravati and covers 4.5 lakh farmers.
 
 Rural development is one of the target areas of the RF. “We want to reach the right information at right time to right people. The voice messages project is a step in this direction,” said Gondane.
 
 For any query, farmers can also call the toll free number of the foundation 18004198800. The project is being implemented by the Reliance Foundation Information Service.
