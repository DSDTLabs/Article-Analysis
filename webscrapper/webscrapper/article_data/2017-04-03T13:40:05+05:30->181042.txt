NOIDA:  's Noida assembling centre on Monday re-opened a week after it was closed over Indian flag incident. A team of   personnel were deployed for safety reasons outside the office in Sector 63. Armed security guards were deployed at the entry gate of the company. The employees rejoined the work peacefully.

 Last Monday some workers at the Oppo Company alleged that a Chinese official had torn and thrown a photo of the Indian flag into the dustbin. They alleged that the Oppoâ€™s production manager, identified by the police as  , had torn up a poster which had a picture of the Indian national flag and thrown it into a dustbin. The police had registered an FIR against Suhahu, based on the workers' complaint. The company later sacked the manager.
 
 On Thursday, the Noida police said that they were examining the company's   camera footage which shows Suhahu throwing 'something' from the table into the dustbin. The footage, however, is not clear enough to establish what was thrown into the bin. Ashok Kumar, Chowki incharge Sector 63, said that the police officials are investigating the matter.
 
 A group of jobseekers were also at the company office in the morning. The company officials however asked to come some other time. Oppo officials did not share the details of internal investigation into the matter.
