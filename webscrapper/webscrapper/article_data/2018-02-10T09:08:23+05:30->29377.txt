CHENNAI: Even as about 56,000 lawyers in Tamil Nadu are gearing up to cast their votes in elections to   and Puducherry, a   wants   (none of the above) option for the voters. 

 Bar council polls are to be held across the state on March 28.
 
 When the PIL, filed by advocate  , came up for admission before the first bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   on Friday, the bench asked the council’s special committee to consider the PIL-petitioner’s representation on the matter.
 
 Arumugam, pointing out that voters participating in general elections had an option not to vote to anyone, such a provision was not available in the Bar council elections. 
 
 “The handicap of non provision for Nota in elections to BCTP irked me, and some other advocates too had the same view,” he said adding that his representation to the BCTP calling upon the statutory body to make provision for Notadid not evoke any response. 
 
 Since he did not receive any reply, he felt constrained to filed the PIL in the high court, Arumugam said.
