Hyderabad: In a relief for city-based pharma player   Pharma, the US district court of Delaware has ruled in its favour in a patent infringement case related to Mucinex DM drug filed by Reckitt Benckiser.

 Reckitt Benckiser had filed a patent infringement suit against Aurobindo Pharma Limited and its arm -- Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc, which had submitted an abbreviated new drug application to market a generic version of Mucinex DM. The drug is used in the treatment of cold and flu.
 
 In its ruling, the court said, “Having reviewed the record in the light most favorable to Reckitt, and drawing all reasonable inferences in Reckitt's favor, the Court concludes that this circumstantial evidence does not provide an adequate basis on which a reasonable factfinder could find infringement.”
