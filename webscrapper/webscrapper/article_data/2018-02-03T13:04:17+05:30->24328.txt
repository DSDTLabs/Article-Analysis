Tirunelveli: All India Congress Committee national spokesperson and actor-turned-politician   had some embarrassing moments during her visit to   on Friday as the party’s urban district office where she was supposed to visit was shut. Khushbu was later forced to go to a hotel where she addressed reporters on politics and budget.

 Though representatives of the Tirunelveli urban district were not there to receive or accompany her, the party’s Tirunelveli East and West district units were with Khushbu. She was here to address cadre and public in a meeting at   on the outskirts of the city. The meeting was organised by the Tirunelveli East unit.
 
 While president of the urban district unit Sankarapandian (loyalist of party’s state president  ) told reporters that he was not informed of her visit, party representatives of the east district unit said they had informed the urban district unit. Party sources said that the incident was unexpected and had exposed the intra-party tangle.
 
 When asked about the incident, Khushbu said that it could have been avoided. She said that she was here on the instruction of the party high command as part of their responsibilities to strengthen the party.
 
 Khushbu added that the party’s state unit was also aware of her taking part in the event and that any issue within the party could have been brought to her notice and sorted out. “I will continue taking part in meetings to strengthen the party,” she added.
 
 Criticising the Union budget, she said the Centre had failed to come out with schemes benefiting the poor and working class over the last four years. 
 
 “The   government lacked individuality and has only taken the pain to rename a few welfare schemes that were introduced by the Congress-led UPA government,” she said.
