CHENNAI: After keeping him on “wait list” for three months, the   government on Thursday appointed former   P   as director of the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Chennai.

 The senior bureaucrat was removed from the post in December, a day after the Income Tax sleuths conducted a search at his Anna Nagar residence and at his official chamber in the secretariat, bringing much embarrassment to the government. He was replaced by Girija Vaidyanathan.
 
 Incidentally, Rao had told reporters then that he continued to be the chief secretary of the state and alleged that he was being targeted because he was being seen as a big hurdle for many forces. He said the raids by the I-T department were illegal as the warrant issued was not on his name. 
 
 The public department on Thursday transferred K Rajaraman from the EDI and posted him as commissioner of land administration department.
