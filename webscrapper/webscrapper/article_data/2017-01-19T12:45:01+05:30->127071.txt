For all those who have watched  , one cannot forget the iconic tree that was frequented by Archi ( ) and Parshya ( ) during their courtship days? 

  
  
 And with the film striking gold in Box Office and being termed as a cult film of Marathi cinema, the tree, which is in Solapur’s  , couldn’t escape limelight either. It has been a popular tourist spot of sorts for young lovers. However, it is now reported that the dried tree branch finally gave way recently, not being able to withstand the wrath of selfies and pictures that were clicked atop the tree. Sad end to the symbol of love and affection. Meanwhile, Sairat’s actors Rinku and Akash have recently been roped in by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to be brand ambassadors of the upcoming elections and urge young voters to come out and exercise their power.
