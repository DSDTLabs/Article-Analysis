AHMEDABAD: In the rarest of the rare surgery, doctors at Civil hospital in   removed a fetus from a 7-month-old baby girl,  , from Chhota Udepur. 

 This medical condition called ‘Fetus in Fetu’ occurs one in five lakh cases and only 200 such cases have been recorded in medical history. 
 
 Prinsa, the first child of her parents, from Kavant village in Chhota Udepur, was found with a big lump in her abdomen two months ago. 
 
 Her parents,   and Manisha Rathwa, who are farm labourers, brought the child to the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad.
 
  She underwent surgery on February 19 and doctors led by Dr  , the head of the paediatric surgery department, recovered a fetus weighing around 130 gram with a head, spine, limb buds and anal cavity.
 
 “Fetus in fetu is a rare condition that has been defined as the presence of one of the twins in the body of the other,” Joshi said. 
 
 “The most important part of this rare surgery was the fact that vital structures like liver, portal vein, aorta, renal vessels, pancreas and inferior vena cava (or IVC), a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart, were meticulously preserved.”
 
 The patient recovered well in post-operative period without any complications, said the doctors. With various kinds of sonography available during pregnancy, it is not difficult to spot such abnormalities but the patient’s parents are from a village and did not have such facilities, said doctors.
 
 The parents said that they were not aware about their kid’s condition until she started developing a lump in the abdominal area. Even medical examinations during pregnancy could not reveal the fetus-like structure. 
 
 In 2006, a big fetus was discovered inside the stomach of a 36-year-old male,  , from Nagpur city of Maharashtra. That fetus had developed limbs, jaw, hair, long finger nails, and genitalia.
