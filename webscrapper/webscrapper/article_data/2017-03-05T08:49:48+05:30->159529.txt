AHMEDABAD: A state of the art food laboratory in Vadodara is being set up to test food, pharmaceutical samples for any sort of hazardous contaminants and adulterants in a matter of hours. Gujarat’s food and drugs control administration on Saturday signed an MoU for strategic partnership for this purpose with 50-year-old French company, bioMerieux.

 To start with, the company will establish a training programme in microbiological testing technologies for pharmaceutical and food sectors at the upcoming laboratory. The partnership was signed between bioMerieux corporate VP,  , Gujarat’s joint secretary, health and family welfare, Vanrajsinh Vanzara, and   commissioner  .
 
 “Our typical laboratory tests for microbiological contamination takes a good 14 days for confirmation. Here bioMerieux will help upgrade our labs to test the same food samples for contamination within 24 hours,” said Koshia. “The French company will also train our biotechnology division in the latest diagnostic techniques,” he added. 
 
 Koshia said it was important that the lab inculcate technologies to help rapid monitoring of micro-organisms — environmental, spoilage as well as pathogenic.   of bioMerieux told TOI, “Gujarat is also one of the country’s largest pharma hubs. After the government, we also plan to reach out to private pharma enterprises and even train them in the latest industrial scale technology for monitoring agents like pesticides, hazardous chemicals, toxins, micro-organisms and even allergens in products or food.”
 
 Koshia added that in the coming days rapid diagnostics will be a key driver for industries to improve efficacies of their pharmaceutical products including cosmetics. 
 
 “For us, an upgraded laboratory with rapid diagnostics will mean better enforcement of quality standards and keeping check over dubious products,” he said.
