Nagpur: Did you know the state forest department has posts of wardboys, paniwala, nakedar, black smith, sharpener, compounder, matron, khalasi, box boy, PT master, mechanic, lethman among many others? Even as the forest department talks of taking to modern times, many of its cadre posts are still age-old and one fails to understand if these posts are being still in use or being misused? Information sought under RTI Act by activist Abhay Kolarkar reveals that there are 151 cadre posts with a strength of 20,060 staff. Of these, 17,772 posts have been filled while a huge chunk of 2,288 are lying vacant. There are many posts which are still in existence despite their role coming to an end. However, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) for administration and subordinate cadre agreed that there is no relevance of many posts. “Over 100 such posts will be merged with other departments where there is shortage,” said Singh. Among the top level posts that are vacant include two CCFs, four each CFs & DyCFs, 23 DFOs, 57 ACFs among others. In Group A, there are 110 vacant posts. Similarly, under Group B, 161 posts of RFOs and 21 of office superintendents are lying vacant. Not only crucial field level posts but many clerical posts are also lying vacant. Under Group C, 254 posts of foresters and 787 posts of forest guards are vacant. “How can the objective of forest protection be achieved under such circumstances,” asks Kolarkar. On the contrary, APCCF Singh says the figures about vacant posts have been wrongly fed. “There are not so many vacancies. Recently, we filled 11,000 posts of forest guards and around 250 RFOs. I’m looking into the issue,” he added. However, the RTI information was supplied on vacant posts till March 2017.
