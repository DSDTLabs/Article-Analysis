PATNA: As part of the first step towards taking a decision for the joint celebration of the four-year achievements of PM   by the Bihar  , CM   would participate in its meet in Patna on June 7.

 It was decided on Sunday after state BJP president Nityanand Rai and party’s state general secretary (organization) Nagendraji met Nitish. Rai said the CM agreed to participate in the June 7 meet. However, the venue was yet to be decided.
 
 Rai and Nagendraji informed the CM about the formal launch of the celebration on Sunday by organizing a meet of the ‘prabuddha varg’ at Gyan Bhavan here. The duo also discussed with the CM the need to have a joint celebration of the achievements of PM Modi. Union ministers from Bihar, ministers in the state government and office-bearers of   NDA partners would participate in the meet, which in some ways is expected to make the state NDA a seamless political entity.
 
 After the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi quit the NDA and joined the fold led by RJD, the Bihar NDA in the state have Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party as well as the JD(U) led by Nitish.
 
 Interestingly, it would be the first meet of the NDA with the JD(U) also in it, after Nitish walked out of the ‘mahagathbandhan’ in July last year and formed government with the BJP. Otherwise, the grand alliance comprised JD(U), RJD and  . 
 
 The state BJP has already announced to have the fortnight-long celebration of the achievements of PM Modi down to the booth level in the state, underlining it with the slogan ‘booth jeeto, chunao jeeto’. In a way, the celebration that is to be completed on June 11 is considered to be the BJP’s plunge for the organizational preparations with an eye on the 2019 parliamentary elections.
