NASHIK/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   was laid to rest on Saturday after a fresh postmortem was conducted at Government Medical College,  , following his family’s allegations that there were injury marks on his body.

 Roy, who hailed from   district in Kerala, was found hanging from the ceiling of an abandoned barrack on the premises of Centre of Artillery at Deolali on Thursday. He was missing since February 25. His family had complained to the Kerala chief minister and the   chief on March 1. A day later, the Army confirmed his death.
 
 The body was flown to Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday after postmortem at Nashik civil hospital. The relatives wanted a fresh postmortem, but were prevented by the Army men accompanying the body from Maharashtra. Later, the district collector and Kollam (rural) SP intervened and the body was shifted to the medical college hospital.
 
 The Army issued a statement a day ago saying Roy might have hanged himself.
 
 It was also pointed out that the Army had found him to be responsible for leaking information to an online news portal about the ‘sahayak’system in the force.
 
 Roy’s brother   claimed he saw injury marks on the body and demanded a postmortem to be conducted in Kerala.
 
 “I accompanied Roy’s body from Deolali to Thiruvananthapuram.
 I noticed marks of beating on his feet and blood clots.
 
 We suspect he was harassed,” he told. Minister of state for defence, Subhash Bhamre, had on Friday announced a high-level probe into the death to ascertain how an earlier video featuring Roy had gone viral..
