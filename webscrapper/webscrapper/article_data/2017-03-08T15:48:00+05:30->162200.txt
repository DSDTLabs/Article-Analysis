Singer   says he is 'desperately sad' his son would not get to meet his 'amazing' godmother  .

 The 43-year-old singer says he is upset as his eight-month-old son, whom he shares with his wife  , will never 'get to know her'. "She's the most amazing person I know and I'm really desperately sad he won't get to know her but I have many memories, many stories I'll be able to tell him," Blunt says. 
 
  
  
 He previously admitted that "life won't be as fun" without Fisher, with whom he struck up an unlikely friendship after ex-girlfriend  , whose family are long-time friends of the   star, introduced them. 
 
 Fisher died on December 27 last year after suffering a cardiac episode aboard an airplane.
