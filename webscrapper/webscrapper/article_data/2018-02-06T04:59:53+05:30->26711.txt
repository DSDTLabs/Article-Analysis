NEW DELHI: The family accused of last week's "honour" killing in west Delhi had a previous brush with inter-faith alliance. Another daughter of the Muslim family - a cousin of the girl over whom Thursday's violence took place - had married a Brahmin priest three years ago. The family had since barred her from entering their Raghubir Nagar house. 

  The cousin now stays with her husband and in-laws in a rented house near Bihari Mandi in Raghubir Nagar. "She has turned into a vegetarian, like her husband, and occasionally meets her grandmother, but only at the market. The girl's mother has banned her entry to their house," said Priya, a family friend. 
 
 On Thursday, the girl's father, uncle and mother allegedly attacked 23-year-old  , slitting his throat with a knife and killing him. Ankit was seeing their daughter.
