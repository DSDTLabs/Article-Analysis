Years ago, director   acted and directed in a short film called Simply Kailasam. While he then went on to make the transition to the big screen by directing  , acting remained a passion and he chose to star in his next project '   ' which is slated to release this week. A romantic comedy with a philosophical twist, the film, says Srinivas, has all elements of a commercial potboiler, including an introductory song for him, which the team will release online on Wednesday.

 The song, says the actor-director, is special to him on many levels. 'Written by lyricist-director  , it is a peppy dance number that goes Bettadh Mele Srinivaasu, Namdhu Hesru Same Bossu. The idea behind the song is that all miracles start in darkness, and my song does so as well. We are also highlighting the fact that there is a culture of having an intro number for every hero. Not many know that I was a choreographer around 10 years ago. I used to be a background dancer for most big stars for their stage shows. This song will show people that I can dance as well."
 
 But what will stand out the most, adds Srinivas, are the four sets that will be seen in the film that were done on minimal budgets. 'Our art director   is famed for having worked on big-budget films, but with this song he has shown that even junk material can look awesome onscreen. We used material like empty paint cans, white shirts, aluminum foil and magazines to create varying backdrops for the song. Once that was in place, execution became important and we had to make sure to make the most within our limited resources. My choreographer  , who is making his debut with this film, has done an amazing job. Overall, though, the song will become a talking point for its art direction and cinematography,' he says.
