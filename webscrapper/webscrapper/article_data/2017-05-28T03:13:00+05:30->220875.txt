Panaji: Students and researchers at the Krishnadas Shama Goa State Central Library were in for a surprise on Saturday afternoon when they begun to feel vibrations in the state-of-the-art building. The vibrations, which lasted for around 20 minutes, were experienced at periodic intervals, even by those sitting on the fourth and fifth floors in the rare Goan history section and the reference and audio visual section. The librarians alerted officials who requested that the work of piling for the footbridge behind the library be stopped. The library’s compound wall and the pavers and pier of its footbridge have already suffered some damage due to a ongoing work on a private project adjacent to the library.  CCP had issued the builders a stop work order in March this year. Minister for art and culture Govind Gaude had also said then that Gera Developments would bear the entire cost of repairs to the damages to the library building, that also houses the directorate of art and culture. After that, a diaphragm wall was built around the construction to ensure that there is no further destruction to the library building.  Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) is constructing a footbridge from Patto to Mala, and has undertaken piling work behind the library. The upcoming cable-stayed footbridge will be a single pylon steel footbridge sans any columns in the Rua de Ourem creek.  The bridge work is being undertaken under the central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme.
