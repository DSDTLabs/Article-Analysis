SHIMLA: Chief minister   has said that the state government was committed to filling all posts of doctors and para-medical staff on priority so that people do not suffer for want of staff. He said that 262 posts of MBBS doctors had been filled through walk-in-interviews and 200 posts of doctors would be filled through state public service commission so as to meet the shortage of doctors in health institutions, particularly in rural and far-flung areas. 

 He said this while presiding over the inauguration of ‘Interventional Radiology Outreach’ programme organized by the department of radio-diagnosis,   and Hospital (IGMCH) here. He further stated that the government was committed to further strengthening the IGMCH with advanced facilities and latest equipment. He said that a Rs 9 crore digital subtraction angiography machine was being installed at the IGMCH. “The state government will provide the remaining amount of Rs 1.50 crore required for this machine,” he added. The CM said that a C-ARM would also be provided in the department soon.
 
 Jai Ram said that necessary staff would be hired for making the Rs 23 crore linear accelerator machine functional, which had been lying unused at Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda in Kangra district, for want of requisite staff. He said that a similar machine would be installed at the IGMCH as soon as the new building was made available. 
 
 While inspecting the progress of the under-construction OPD building coming up at a cost of Rs 56.20 crore, he directed the officers concerned to complete the work within the stipulated time.
