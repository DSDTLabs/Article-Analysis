BENGALURU: Accusing police of 'rough behaviour' and filing a false case against him, activist-journalist   alias Agni   petitioned director general and inspector general of police (DG-IGP)   on Monday against additional commissioner of police Hemanth   and his team.

 On February 8, a police team led by Nimbalkar raided Sridhar's house and arrested seven men, including Amanul la alias  , a rowdy-sheeter and close associate of Sridhar.
 
 “With a search warrant from the court, police entered my house and searched for  , who is the officebearer of a social organization. Nimbalkar accused me of sheltering criminals and having contacts with north Indian contract killers. On Nimbalkar's direction, an inspector slapped me.
 
 They booked me and others in a false criminal case,“ Sridhar wrote in his petition. R K Dutta told TOI: “I have received the petition and will look into it.“
