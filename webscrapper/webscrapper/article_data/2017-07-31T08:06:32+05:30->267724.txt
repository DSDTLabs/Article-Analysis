GUNTUR: Despite good rain so far this monsoon,   falls, which is a major monsoon tourist destination in   district of Andhra Pradesh, remains completely dry. Located about 15km away from   dam on   river, Ethipothala falls gets its water from Krishna right canal. 

 This year, tourists from Hyderabad and other nearby places visiting the falls were disappointed to see no water. In fact, many didn’t even bother to venture beyond the gate of the observatory after guards informed them about lack of water in the falls.
 
 The tourist complex of the falls, which was inaugurated in December 2002, also had an illumination show in the evening. This has been discontinued now since there is no water in the falls. The 70ft tall cascade attracts tourists visiting Nagarjunsagar dam during monsoon.
 
 “The water in the falls depends on Krishna right canal. If the water is not released in the canal, there won’t be any water in the falls,” said Datta Kumar, who is in-charge of the tourist complex of the waterfall. “It all depends on the rain. Even last year, there was no water in July. Usually, water flows normally after September,” Datta added.
 
 So far, both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have reportedly received excess rainfall this monsoon.
 
 However, less rainfall in catchment areas of Krishna river and its tributaries has reduced inflows to Almatti dam in Karnataka from where Nagarjunsagar receives its inflow, which is the prime source of water for the falls.
