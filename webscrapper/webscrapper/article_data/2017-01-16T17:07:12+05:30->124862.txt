 Rudrapur: When sub-inspector Ram Pradesh ventured out on his motorcycle without wearing a helmet on Sunday morning, little did he imagine that he would draw the attention of a vigilante youth and get a rap from the additional superintendent of police. A City Patrol Unit (CPU) officer, Pradesh was driving around Rudrapur, when Gurpinder Singh Lalpuriya of Awas Vikas colony clicked his photograph and posted it on a WhatsApp group that had ASP Manjunath TC as a member.   The ASP, who leads the CPU, chanced upon Pradesh’s photo on WhatsApp that Lalpuriya had shared and immediately issued an order to track him down and issue a challan.    “Social media is a way of having more eyes and ears among people. At times we see incidents being reported on such platforms first. But it also helps us. Ram Pradesh was issued a challan moments after I received the picture,” said Manjunath.    Lalpuriya, while talking to TOI, said he was quite astonished to see a traffic cop, flouting the same norms he is supposed to enforce. “But I’m happy that my action brought results and that he was taken to task.”    Motorcycle-borne CPU was introduced in Rudrapur last year to reduce incidence of crime and traffic violations in the city. Eight teams of these officers, dressed in blue and armed with equipment like alcometers, pistols and pepper sprays take to the streets to ensure road safety. These teams fine traffic violators for overspeeding, wearing no helmets, talking on phone while driving, etc. “There has been a significant decline in the number of road accidents since October and 95% of the bikers have started wearing helmets and following traffic rules,” CPU inspector SL Kanyal claimed.
