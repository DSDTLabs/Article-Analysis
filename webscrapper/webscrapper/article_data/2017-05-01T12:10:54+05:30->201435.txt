HYDERABAD:   and  ,   (Telangana amendment) Act 2016 received three major amendments and underwent 10 changes during a specially convened Assembly session on Sunday. 

 The changes recommended by   have far-reaching implications as this has further strengthened  , tenants, agriculture labour and artisans.
 
 The first amendment was to include 'without affecting vested rights', which means the Act after getting the President's assent would have an 'overriding and retrospective effect', but without affecting vested interests of those affected. Actually, the state government wanted to override pending litigation since 2014 through the Act, but the Union law ministry pointed out that denial of vested rights of the aggrieved may not stand legal scrutiny. Accordingly, the clause 1 (3) was amended.
 
 The second amendment added the sentence - Provided that no agreement or the lump sum amount towards rehabilitation and resettlement as may be prescribed, shall be abnormally at variance to the disadvantage of the land owners. This is aimed to ensure land owners should get higher compensation which should be comparable with existing market rates of land. 
 
 The third amendment is similar to the second, but aimed at protecting rights of agriculture labour, artisans and local people that get affected with the land acquisition. Four old clauses were omitted and three new clauses were renumbered in the final bill that will go to the President.
 
 "Amendments are aimed to ensure fair compensation and rehabilitation to all affected with land acquisition," said B R Meena, special chief secretary of revenue department.
