AL Vijay, famous for his 
  'Madrasapattinam' and ' ', has come up with a horror film titled '
 ' in Tamil and '
 ' in Telugu. The film that has been acted for release since long has finally seen the light of day. 

 Starring  ,   and   in lead roles, the film charts the journey of the newly married couple Krishna (Naga Shaurya) and Tulasi (Sai Pallavi). Lovers since they were teenagers, Krishna is eager and happy to have married Tulasi after a wait of five years. Tulasi however seems to be stuck in the past, to an incident that changed her life forever. While their marriage seems complicated in itself, with the couple trying hard to put the past behind them and make it work, they have a third wheel, an unseen entity, not making it any easier for them.
 
 The first half sees Priyadarshi play the role of SI Agni, a cowardly officer obsessed with food and Bigg Boss. Unlike him, his constables however are playing close attention to all the mysterious deaths that surround the couple, especially Tulasi. 'Kanam' has so far been a predictable yet engaging ride, with all the deaths playing out with an innovativeness reminiscent of 'Final Destination'. However, the film does drag on a bit in the first half when it gets a tad bit repetitive. 
 
 With all the cards laid out right before the interval, it remains to be seen if 'Kanam' has any surprises in store in the second half. 
 
 Watch this space for full   of movie 'Kanam'.
