 While this category saw a slip of seven marks, according to the scores released by the   ( ), on Monday, the cut-off for backward class candidates recorded this year was 45 (as opposed to 49 in 2017), 29 for scheduled caste (as against 32) and 24 for scheduled tribe (as against 27).

 Experts attributed this steady drop in cut-off to CBSE’s decision to enhance the number of candidates qualifying for JEE (Advanced).
 
 “This year, it was decided that an additional 4,000 students would be selected for the Advanced stage. Since the difficulty level of the paper was increased, the board had no choice but to reduce the cut-off score to achieve the desired figures,” said  , IIT exam head at Triumphant Institute of Management Education, Hyderabad. Educationalists said that the decision to hike the count of qualifying students is rooted in the increase in number of total seats across IITs.
 
 “Many students who clear the Advanced exam ultimately drop out — thus leaving several seats vacant. To avoid that, the board had made this move,” said an expert. In comparison to last year when 1,09,585 candidates from across the country (in general category) qualified for the Advanced exam, this year the number is a high 1,11,275 — a rise of 1,690 candidates. The overall number of candidates qualifying for JEE (Advanced) also increased to 2,31,024 this year from 2,21,427 last year.
