BENGALURU: A 30-year-old woman from Kolkata has been arrested for allegedly stealing Rs 24,500 from the handbag of a passenger during baggage screening at Kempegowda International Airport.

 Chitra  , who flew from Bengaluru to Mumbai on an IndiGo flight on Saturday, complained to the Central Industrial Security Force in Mumbai that someone had stolen cash from her handbag.   officials alerted their counterparts at   about the theft.
 
 
 CISF inspector   began scouring CCTV footage at the airport and found that a woman stole money from Bhavani’s handbag during baggage screening at KIA at 1.48pm on Saturday.
 
 The culprit was identified as Munmun Husen Baruva, a singer from Kolkata.
 
 
 Woman confessed to the crime, say police
 
 She had travelled from Bengaluru to Hyderabad the same day on an   flight.   personnel, who had learnt that she had booked a return flight to Bengaluru, caught her on Monday midnight and handed her over to the KIA police.
 
 “No one steals at the airport’s security and screening section as everything is visible. But the CCTV footage baffled us. A woman frisked by the security personnel was seen opening Bhavani’s handbag and taking out the cash. Everything happened in a few seconds and the woman walked away before Bhavani completed the screening process and came to collect her bag,” a source said. Police said they have arrested Munmun based on a complaint lodged by CISF officials, who also provided the CCTV footage of the incident.
 
 “We’ve registered a case of theft and arrested her. She confessed to the crime. She said it was her first, and promised not to repeat it. We produced her before court, which remanded her in judicial custody,” a police officer said.
 
 Munmun told police she performs at parties in major cities. Investigations said she separated from her husband a few years ago and lived with her parents and son in Kolkata.
