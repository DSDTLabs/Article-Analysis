INDORE: Cricket is a game of numbers. Runs, wickets, averages, strike rate, economy, records all are numbers. The cricketers these days are mindful of what number of jersey they wear. Though none of them accepts it publicly, they follow certain suggested by numerologists.

 Nagpur based numerologist Sumiit Messhram, who was in Indore on Saturday, said number 6 has a great significance to the Indian cricket. “Number 6 is very lucky for India. India with the date of independence August 15 ruled by 1+5=6 and name number 3 are always lucky for Team India. Whether it's calender year or date of the match if total is 6 or 3, India have an advantage. A great example is 1983 World Cup with total 1+9+8+3= 21= 2+1= 3. It was also the third world cup. The final score also 183= 1+8+3=12=1+2=3,” Messhram, who claims to have given numerological tips to fast bowler Umesh Yadav, told TOI.
 
 Messhram also claims to have given tips to other India A and domestic cricketers. Messhram, a physiotherapist by profession, said 6, 15, 24, 3, 12, 21, 30 dates are lucky for Team India. “Numbers can also predict whether you can win or lose. No, it’s not statistics it’s numerology. Believe it or not numbers follow us,” he said.
 
 “India won the Twenty20 World Cup defeating Pakistan on September 24, 2007. The total of which is 6. The historical Kolkata Test, which India won after being asked to follow on, started on March 15, 2001. The first ODI double century, hit by master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, came on February 24, 2010 against South Africa.
 
 Messhram claims India have won high percentage of games on date 24. “I don’t remember India lost on any 24th. Recently on August 24, we witnessed India won miraculously after losing seven wickets for 133 against Sri Lanka. Bhuvneshwar Kumar with jersey number 15=1+5=(6) rescued team with handy knock. The players, who are having birth number 6, or destiny number (total of birth date) are also the players who took Indian cricket to the great heights. Sachin Tendulkar was born on April 24. The man who gave us the first ICC world cup -   was born on January 6. Mahendra Singh Dhoni has destiny number 6. 7+7+1+9+8+1=33=3+3=6. He gave us three ICC trophies. Now   who birth date in November 5, 1988. It also comes to 6,” he explained.
 
 As per name numerology Indore also adds up to 6. No wonder India have won all five matches here at Holkar Stadium. They became No.1 in Tests here last year after a thumping win and now they became No.1 in One-dayers here as well. And, the man who took India to five-wicket victory on Sunday,  , had No.33 on his back.
