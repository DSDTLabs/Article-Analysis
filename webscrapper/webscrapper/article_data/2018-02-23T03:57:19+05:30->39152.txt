MUMBAI:   has taken a dig at NCP president   for opposing caste-based reservations in the education sector and employment.

 Pointing out that   was the first and the only leader to support reservations on economic considerations, Thackeray said: “Pawar has taken 50 years to endorse Balasaheb’s views on reservation.”
 
 He was talking to journalists on the sidelines of a party function on Thursday. “Had Pawar backed job and education reservations on economic grounds, there wouldn’t have been such sharp caste divisions and prolonged enmity between communities in Maharashtra,” he said. 
 
 In an open-house interview with MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Pune on Wednesday, Pawar underscored the need to review the reservation policy. “Reservations should be based not on caste but economic considerations,” he said.
