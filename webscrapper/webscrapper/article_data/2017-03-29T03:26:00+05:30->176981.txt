Panaji: Urban development minister Francis D’Souza said that urban villages which are categorized in the 2011 census as ‘census towns’ are eligible to be elevated to municipalities. Of the 190 village panchayats, 56 were declared as ‘census towns’ in 2011. Of these, 40 are in North Goa and 16 in South Goa. “The government has not taken any decision. It is up to the respective village panchayats to decide. They need to adopt a resolution and send it to the government which in turn will take a call,” D’Souza said. Prominent in North Goa are Arambol, Mandrem, Morjim, all major villages of Bardez, including Calangute, Candolim, Siolim, Guirim, Socorro, Salvador do Mundo, Anjuna, Moira, Nerul, Pilerne. In Tiswadi, Bambolim, Chimbel, St Cruz, St Estevam, Cumbharjua are among those coming under ‘census towns’. In Salcete, Benaulim, Navelim, Curtorim, Raia, Nuvem, Davorlim, Verna also come under this category.  Past attempts to convert Calangute panchayat into a municipality was met with resistance and then the government had to drop its plans. In 2002, chief minister Manohar Parrikar had proposed to include Porvorim, Penha da Franca, St Cruz, Merces, in the Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) while retaining Taleigao as a panchayat. The government had to roll back its decision due to opposition.
