MUMBAI: A 42-year-old man was arrested for making off with a co-commuter’s bag, containing valuables worth Rs 14 lakh, after offering to safeguard it on a crowded Andheri-bound  . 

 The accused, Manik  , who works as a gold polisher with a jeweller in  , was tracked down with help of footage of CCTV cameras installed at the station and arrested on Tuesday. He has been remanded in police custody.
 
 The incident took place on July 14, when the victim, Udaysingh Dulawat, a jeweller, carrying a leather bag, boarded the general compartment of the 9.23am Andheri train. When the train reached Nalasopara, Dulawat, who was standing on the footboard, got pushed inside but his bag remained near the door. Santra, who boarded the train at Nalasopara, saw the bag and offered to hold on to it. However, Santra alighted with the bag at Bhayander at 9.45am. Dulawat raised an alarm but Santra escaped. Dulawat then filed a complaint with the Vasai GRP.
 
 Investigating officer Darshan Patil said that they kept a tab on CCTVs after the incident but could not find the accused. “We then examined past footages of up to a month and found him,” said Patil.
 
 After making inquiries, the officials came to know that Santra had not gone to work since July 14. His employer said Santra had come to office on July 14 with the bag but left within 15 minutes, claiming his wife was unwell. Santra was arrested from his home in Nalasopara. He has claimed that this was his first crime.
 
 Santra has told police he works with a jeweller and he was sure the bag contained valuables but did not know it would be gold rings, diamonds and precious stones worth Rs 14.31 lakh. The valuables have been recovered. Santra spent the Rs 15,000 cash which he found in the bag. He said he was still undecided on what he would do with the other valuables and was stressed because of it. Santra’s family was not aware of the theft till he was arrested.
