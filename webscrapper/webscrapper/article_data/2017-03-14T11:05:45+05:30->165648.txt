Vineet Jain, MD Times Group, hosted his annual star-studded Holi party at the Sun & Sand Hotel, Mumbai. A number of 
  stars like 
 , 
 , 
 ,  , Urvashi Rautela, along with a host of television personalities and beauty queens joined in the colourful festivities on Monday morning. 

 All dressed in white, these celebrities went all out to bathe themselves in Holi colours. While some kept dry by just applying coloured powder on the other, there were others who did not mind picking up watercolours and getting creative while they were at it. 
 
 Varun and his ‘
 ’ co-star Alia, hit the dance floor and grooved to some of the latest hits. It was a mini ‘Student Of The Year’ reunion of sorts when   arrived at the party and brought the house down with his hit party track ‘Kala Chashma’.
