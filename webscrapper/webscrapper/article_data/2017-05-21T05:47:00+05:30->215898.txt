 Speaking to TOI, the station’s RJ Neel said the children would learn different profiles at a radio station. “It is an in and out visit. The children will be shown the studio. They will learn the functions of a copywriter, a producer, an RJ etc.”
 
 Explaining the working of a radio station, Neel said it is divided into two departments —  . “The   is the brain behind the working of the station,” he said.
 
 The programming department produces content as per the requirement of the sales department. The RJs and the production team makes ads, spots and jingles.
 
 Every radio station has two RJ profiles — copywriter and promo producers. “The copywriters conceptualize and write the programmes while promo producers compose music for it,” said.
 
 Providing insight into how RJs prepare for every programme, Neel said preparation of almost an hour or two is required before RJs go on air. 
 
 “Everything the RJs say on air involves rigorous preparation. They have to brainstorm every day and come up with ideas before going on air. The ideas also have to be approved by the immediate heads,” Neel said.
 
 The NFK Club members will also be briefed about the exciting opportunities in the field of radio broadcasting. “We will discuss the skill sets required to work at a radio station,” he said.
