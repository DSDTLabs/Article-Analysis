THANE: The downpour since Tuesday that continued on Wednesday has brought with it a string of   and water logging incidents in the city. 

 Over 14 pockets, including Naupada’s Chikalwadi area, Court Naka, Patlipada, Manpada, Glady Alvares road area, Thane station area, Vitawa, Srinagar’s Bhatwadi area, etc were flooded as the city received over 259mm of rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
 As many as 24 tree falls were reported over the past two days, one of which fell on a tempo at Majiwada on Tuesday night causing minor injuries to the driver and a passerby, while another crashed atop another tempo as well as two homes on Pokhran Road 2 on Wednesday morning damaging the vehicle and roof of these houses.
 
 However, as the heavy   intensified overnight, many schools, colleges and even offices were declared shut and thus, not many ventured out through the day resulting in lesser traffic and lesser panic.
 
 Many who did step out for work also had a smooth sailing day despite the heavy rains and the civic body was working overtime to resolve rain-related issues.
 
 “There was water logging near our society at Naupada and we couldn’t get any autos for a while as they didn’t want to come into the rising waters. However, as soon as we complained on the TMC helpline, officials came and started pumping the water out. I walked to the station and caught my train to CSMT and reached work safely,” said Sandeep Desai, a Naupada resident.
 
 Weathermen asserted that the next few days will see intermittent rains. “The sudden heavy showers were a result of the development of a cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea and a low pressure area of the Bay of Bengal. This situation is already in the process of fading away and the next few days will see intermittent showers,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at skymetweather.
