THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police team probing the Rasikan   murder case are yet to record the arrest of the men taken into custody from Idukki on Friday. Attingal deputy SP P Anilkumar, who is leading the special investigation team, said that the men are being interrogated and they would move to procedures such as arrest only after they confirm the men’s role in the crime. 

 The team had taken a few men into custody from Anakkulam in Idukki for allegedly aiding the main culprits, who had killed Rajesh inside his studio.
 
 Sources said that at present three men were in police custody. Of this, two have criminal cases pending against their name. After they were apprehended, it was revealed that the two were wanted in connection with an assault case registered at Kilikolloor police station in Kollam city.
 
 
 Till date, police could arrest only one person who was only involved in the conspiracy part of the crime. The main culprits, who are still at large, plotted the crime in such a way that they had the help of many in executing the crime. While some of them were aware of what was being planned, others were not.
 
 “We had taken many people into custody and later let them go after questioning. We do not want to implicate a wrong person,” said the policeman.
 
 It is suspected that Qatarbased businessman,  , had ordered a hit on Rajesh after he began an extramarital relationship with his then wife. The crime was allegedly committed by a gang led by Sathar’s employee   alias Alibhai. Police have initiated steps to extradite the duo.
