 The Indian Civil Service (ICS) was the   of the   rule in India. It was starte din 1855 and the first batch joined in 1856. Though the first exam for   was held in 1855 in London, not a single Indian, pejoratively called natives then, was there to take the exam because either Indians did not possess the required education and grooming or did not have enough means to travel to London which also included the expenses for boarding and lodging.
 
 Besides, Indian society was superstitious and crossing oceans was considered a bad omen, especially among Hindus. Initially, the ICS was an allwhite affair, but the elder brother of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyendranath Tagore, became the first Indian to qualify the ICS in 1863. Satyendranath was allotted Bombay Presidency Cadre and retired after more than 30 years of service. By 1871, only four Indians had joined the service. By 1883, the total number of Indian ICS were12 and in 1915, exactly 60 years after the first competitive examination of ICS, only 63 Indians had joined the ICS.
 
 
 Most Indian ICS aspirants took loans to go abroad. In the late1890s, the philanthropist JN Tata set up a scholarship/loan fund for Indians to study abroad, which included as a condition that they give the ICS exam (by 1924, over a third of all Indian ICS officers were Tata scholars).
 
 ThefirstIndian tostandfirst in one of the two parts of ICS exam held in 1904 was Gurusaday Dutt of Bengal.
 
 In 98 years of British rule over Punjab, 11 Sikh officers were selected for the ICS. They were Sir Datar Singh (1921 Central Provinces), Hardit Singh Malik (1921-Punjab), Ram Parsad Singh Grewal alias S Pertab (ICS-1921-Punjab); Justice Shamsher Singh Dulat (1928-Punjab); Nawab Singh (1929-Punjab); Kapur Singh (1933-Punjab); MS Randhawa (1934-United Provinces, later Punjab); BS Grewal (1936-Punjab); Tarlok Singh (1937-Punjab); Kewal Singh Chaudhary (1939-Punjab) andGian SinghKahlon (1938-Bengal).
 
 Among them three officers — Kapur Singh ICS, Gian Singh Kahlon ICS and Shamsher Singh Dulat ICS — were nominated officers, whereas the others were competitioners.
 
 Kapur Singh became the first ICS officer to be removed from service in 1948.
 
 Sir William Wedderburn,
 
 ICS, of the 1859 batch, who remained judge of the Bombay high court and retired as chief secretary, Bombay Presidency (present day Maharashtra Gujarat and Sindh province of Pakistan), along with retired director general of agriculture of Government of India AO Hume, ICS, founded the Congress party in 1885.
 
 Hume became its first president in 1885, whereas Wedderburn served as Congress presidentin 1889 and1910.
 
 The first person to qualify for the ICS exam from north India was Sir Shadi Lal Aggarwal of Rewari (Haryana), who was selected in 1902. It’s not well known that Sir Shadi Lal after his training in Haileybury resigned and started practicing as a barrister in Lahore. He later became a judge and chief justice of chief’s court (later upgraded as Lahore high court on March 21,1919).
 
 The ICS officers were given morethan 50% Judgeship in the state high courts and rest were generally elevated from the high court bar. At the time of Partition, there were high courts at Patna, Madras, Nagpur, Bombay, Lahore, Allahabad and Calcutta. There were chief courtsin Sindh andOudh.
 
 The ICS examination was held in London from 1855 to 1921 and from 1922 onwards the exams were held both in Allahabad and London. The only Indian to top the ICS examination in 88 yearswasKumar Padmanabha Sankara Menon, who stood first in the1921batch. In the1920 batch of ICS, interestingly, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose stood fourth. Bose reported for training and resigned in April 1921 and joined the freedom movement and became Congress president in 1938 and1939.
 
 The ICS officers’ grip over the administrative machinery and knowledge of law made their reputation and gave life to their domination over their sphereof activity.But authority and mystique percolated downwards. The glamour and the dazzle came fully buttressed by moral authority. The habit of command flowed from prestige, not the other way round. The mastery of direction was rooted in superiority proven in testing times.
 
 The last ICS to retire as a judge of the high court/Supreme Court in India was Justice SBCapoor,ICS of 1931batch, who retired as a judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court in 1969.
 
 In one of the meetings held in August 1947 in Lahore, Sir Evans Jenkins ICS (1920 batch Punjab cadre), the then governor of Punjab, had said: “You wantustoleaveIndia. Wewould leave very soon but one thing you must remember that you would not be able to maintain those vaulting standards of fairness, honesty, efficaciousness and diligence in administration, which we maintained becauseof theconspicuous role of the ICS and other services despite difficulties of governing and numerous odds faced by us. Time would come when many of youwould remember uswith tears in your eyes and nobody to console you. “After independence asthetime passedby many Indians felt that he was correct in his prognostications.
