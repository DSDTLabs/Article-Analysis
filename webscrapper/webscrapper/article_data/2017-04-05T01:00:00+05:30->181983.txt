Ileana D’Cruz, who was missing in action in Bollywood in 2015 and resurfaced last year with 'Rustom', has two releases lined up this year. Ask her what prompted her to take up ' ' starring   and ' ' opposite   and the actress is quick to reply, “For my role in 'Baadshaho', I wondered whether the character would stand out or blend into the background. I look for something significant and challenging and the film offered me just that.” 
As for 'Mubarakan', Ileana adds, “I’m playing a character called Sweety, who is in complete contrast to my role in 'Barfi'. I looked at the film in its entirety and knew that it’s going to be super entertaining to watch. Playing a Punjabi is a lot of fun. Imagine, I’m a Goan chick who’s trying to speak in Punjabi! And that has kept people on the set in splits.”
