AHMEDABAD: In a   that occurred while making colour in Aarvee Denims   on  , one worker, Navghan Sanev, hailing from Orissa, died, while four others were rushed to   in a critical condition. 

 Police said the victims had been affected by the smoke which emitted while making colour.
 
 The LG hospital officials said that all four patients have been shifted to intensive care unit. “We suspect that the patients have been affected as they might have inhaled some chemical fumes,” said an official from the hospital.
 
 Vatva police station sub-inspector K S Patel said they have registered a case of accidental death at present and are probing whether there was any negligence on the part of the factory management.
 
 According to sub-inspector Patel, around 1 pm, Sanev was making colour, while the other four were working nearby.
 
 “That time smoke emitted from the chemical mixture. All five fell unconscious. Factory manager Bhavin Patel rushed all of them to LG Hospital where Sanev was declared dead, while the four others—Virendra Chiku, 45, Mukesh Guatam, 30, Rajan Yadav, 30, and Paresh Tiwari, 45, all residents of Narol,— were admitted in a critical condition,” Patel said.
 
 Police said they had called forensic experts from DFS Gandhinagar to know the exact nature of chemical reaction which took place while making the colour.
 
 “We are also probing whether proper safety apparatus had been provided to the workers while making the colour or doing other jobs in the factory or not” added Patel.
 
 Police said they have recorded the statement of Bhavin Patel who has mentioned that the smoke had indeed emitted due to chemical reaction.
 
 However, the factory authorities could not be reached for their comments regarding the incident over phone and the text messages sent to them on their cellphones, too, went unanswered.
