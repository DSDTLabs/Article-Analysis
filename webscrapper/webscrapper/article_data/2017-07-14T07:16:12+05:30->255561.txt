HYDERABAD: Ruling out conferring exclusive privileges to either of the two warring NGO outfits, the   on Thursday held that the   at Gunfoundry area in Hyderabad can be used by the members of both AP NGOs association and the members of the  . If there are more requests for the space by members on any single day much beyond the available space, then the 'First Come First Serve' norm operates, the   said. The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice T Rajani made this arrangement while hearing an appeal by   which was questioning the decision of the AP association that was denying them any space in the association. 

 Appearing for the Telangana association, senior counsel A Sudarsan Reddy told the bench that all the members of the T association were members of the AP association in the past. In fact, they continue to be members of the AP association also even now. When the revenue authorities earmarked some of the rooms and halls to T NGOs association, a single judge stayed the division of space. "What all we are seeking is that some space for us also. Or, at least, allow us to use this space on par with other members," he said.
 
 Contending that this space was bought by their association in 1967, the AP NGOs association leaders are contending that dividing their area into two parts is unacceptable to them. Senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana argued their case and told the court that the single judge intervened in the matter because the revenue officials unlawfully interfered in the internal matter of the association. Without any authority of law and without putting the AP association on notice, the officials had divided the space into two parts, he said.
 
 The bench too said that the action of the officials cannot be supported. But it advised both the groups to settle the issue amicably. 
 
 If there is any tussle again, you can come back to us, the bench said and posted the case to Monday.
