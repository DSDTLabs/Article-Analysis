RANCHI: Over 100   and   took to the streets on Wednesday under the aegis of  , an affiliated body of National Hawkers Federation (NHF), demanding   in the state capital. 

 The vendors protested near the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) entrance gate in the afternoon while demanding for permanent markets. The corporation evicted them following a high court order to free the Mahatma Gandhi Road (Main Road) from encroachers who were causing traffic snarls.
 
 Deepak Singh, president of the association said, "Almost a year has passed since we were removed from the main road but RMC has not allotted any kind of permanent vending zone to us to carry out our businesses which is our only source of livelihood. The vendors are now selling their goods door to door or in different localities for which their daily earnings have dipped." 
 
 Singh added that they demanded that they should be relocated to an area near Zilla School and to the vacant space near the administration block of Ranchi University. Anita Das, general secretary of the association said there has been no effective plan for their rehabilitation, "We wanted the chief minister's advice as the issue has reached a stalemate between RMC and the hawkers," she said. 
 
 Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra who was apprised about the protest outside her office said, "For the hawkers we have already started constructing various permanent markets on the southern side of Jaipal Singh stadium. It is a two-year project and hopefully by the end of the year, the construction will be completed and 400 shops will be allocated to the hawkers and street-vendors."
