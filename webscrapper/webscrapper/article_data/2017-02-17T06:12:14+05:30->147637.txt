INDORE: The   seeking to control the   on weddings is drawing a   from the people in the city with the   and people associated with the wedding business calling it a negative move. 

 According to the bill, a family must declare the amount it wishes to spend on a wedding, and if the amount exceeds Rs 5 lakh, ten percent of the total amount must be donated to a   of girls whose families are below poverty line. The bill also seeks to limit the number of dishes on the menu and guests invited to weddings. 
 
 “Instead of benefitting the poor, this move might cause harm. From a fixed budget that families have for weddings, if 10 per cent is donated, the amount left for the actual wedding will reduce that will affect quality of work. It will ultimately affect the people involved in wedding businesses,” Sonal Anand, wedding conceptualizer from the city said. 
 
 Event planners also feel that even if the bill comes out as law, people will find loopholes and circumvent the law, leading to illegal transactions. 
 
 For medium to large scale weddings, the cost of venues itself reaches above Rs 5 lakh. Ten per cent of any amount above Rs 5 lakh is a significant amount, out of the hard earned money collected by families. 
 
 “The limit should be increased to Rs 10-12 lakh at least and the percentage of donation should be decreased. It should also be kept as a choice and not a mandate,” Milind Dekhane, who recently organized his daughter’s marriage, said. 
 
 The bill proposed by Congress MP Ranjeet Rajan is set to be introduced in the upcoming Lok Sabha session.
