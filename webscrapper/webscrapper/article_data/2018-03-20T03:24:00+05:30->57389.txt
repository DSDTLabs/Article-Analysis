Ponda: The ruling panel of the Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) has blamed the delayed Outer Development Plan (ODP) for pending developmental works. The council had sought zone changing to facilitate some of their ambitious projects, but the ODP has not been finalised and the plans remain in abeyance. In 2016, PMC had planned to construct several multi-storied projects across the town and had sought zone changing and increased Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for lands coming under settlement zones. The PMC had also approved proposals regarding changes in ODP to facilitate its projects like a recreation building and parking near the old busstand, etc. Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) had even approved four major development projects worth Rs 100 crore including Shastri Hall, Municipal Garden, Underpass at St Annes Church and the City centre project.  The projects were expected to be complete by the end of the councilâ€™s tenure.
