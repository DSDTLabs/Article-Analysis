HYDERABAD: Despite third party consultants assisting the Greater   (GHMC) quality control department, several contractors continue to do shoddy civic works.

 
 The amount of fines imposed on contractors for carrying out   is increasing each year.
 
 
 In the year 2016-17 fines worth Rs 152 lakh were imposed for Rs 1,07,747 lakh worth works executed. Works were inspected by GHMC and contractors were asked to re-do them. In the year 2015-16, fines worth Rs 125 lakh were imposed and in 2014-15 contractors were penalised with Rs 106 lakh.
 
 
 While the locals demand better civic amenities, activists suggest that naming the contractor on the pylon or erecting a flexie with the name and agency to whom the work has been avoided can save public money.
 
 
 “Instead of having the name of politicians on the pylon, the name of the contractor or the name of the agency to which the work has been given should be displayed with the telephone numbers of the contractor as well as the concerned officials,” said  , general secretary, Loksatta Greater Hyderabad.
 
 
 Activists also said that there should be a slab on the number of works awarded to a contractor. “Blacklisting the contractors and ensuring that the contractors get only limited work can ensure better civic amenities,” said  , a road safety expert.
