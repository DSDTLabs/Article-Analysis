CHENNAI: Dozens of fishermen came in 20 boats and converged at the site where   Energy Company Limited, Vallur (NTECL) power plant is setting up a 140-acre coal ash pond in a   area. The ongoing construction also encroaches into the Kuruvimedu Periya Kaalvai, a navigation channel used for transport of salt from salt pans to  .

 “The Kuruvimedu Kaalvai is an important area for fish breeding. Because of the presence of mangroves, this is one part of the creek that is still intact. This construction will affect the natural state of the area gravely,” said Selvaraj, a fisherman from Kaatukuppam.
 
 “The failure of   and the district administration to enforce the law is affecting our health and livelihoods,” said R L Srinivasan, president of Kattukuppam Fisher Welfare Cooperative Society.
 
 Charging authorities with inaction, Vijaya, a fisherwoman from  , said, “This river is not only ours, it belongs to our future generation too. When it is being destroyed in front of us, it is our responsibility to act. We invite the authorities to intervene at least now and remedy the situation.”
 
  of Coastal Resources Centre said the NTECL’s construction fell afoul of the fly ash Notification and the CRZ Notification. NTECL obtained its environmental clearance by guaranteeing that no fly ash would be dumped in the coal ash pond.
 
 NTECL’s proposed ash pond will obliterate 34 acres of mangroves within the 140-acre tidal creek, activists said.
