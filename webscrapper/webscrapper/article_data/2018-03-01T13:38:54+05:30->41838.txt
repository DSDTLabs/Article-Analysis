INDORE: Indore bench of high court has directed the civic body to pass appropriate orders regarding construction of a ‘skywalk’ between C21 and   mall, within 30 days of receipt of certified copy of the order. 

 Justice SC Sharma passed this direction in the petition filed by owner of the two malls seeking sanction for skywalk from Indore Municipal Corporation. The petitioner had argued that for the permission, only NOC of town and country planning department (TnCP) and   was needed. 
 
 IMC was ready to give NOC, but also directed the owner to take the same from   (IDA), claiming that   stated that ‘authority’ must provide an NOC.
 
 The petitioner moved the court with the pleading that NOC from IDA was not needed since the definition of ‘authority’ was TnCP department. 
 
 IDA too stated that they were not the authority to give NOC for skywalks as per Bhumi Vikas Niyam, and hence they should be exempted from it. 
 
 After taking on record submissions of all concerned departments the court ruled that the IDA was not required to give a NOC for construction of skywalk and IMC was the responsible authority to issue permission for the same. Hence, the court directed IMC to pass appropriate order in the petition filled by owner of two malls within 30 days of receipt of the certified copy of the order. 
 
 IMC had previously granted NOC for construction, and now the permission for the same is awaited. 
 
 C21 and Malhar Mega mall were constructed at AB Road in July and August 2008 and application for permission to build the sky walk was submitted to TnCP in 2014.
