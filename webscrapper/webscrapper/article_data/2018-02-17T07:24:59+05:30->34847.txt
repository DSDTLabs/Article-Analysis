BHOPAL: Presence of doctors including neuro and orthopaedic surgeons and awareness about emergency facilities through media and hoardings are crucial for the golden hour, the first hour after a traumatic injury, when treatment is most likely to be successful. 

 Doctors said though several trauma centres and units have come up in the city, they will yield results only when they have a team of doctors present for emergency treatment. "Proper diagnosis of any accident victim is the first and foremost thing and that can be achieved only when a team of doctors is available in the trauma unit. 
 
  
  
 
 The government is taking steps in this regard," said Dr  , general secretary,   Doctors Forum. He said presence of neuro, orthopaedic surgeons and other staff yield better results in saving the lives. Doctors also insisted on the need of increased awareness about available emergency services. "Often an accident victim is deprived of emergency treatment during golden hour because the people, who were helping, did not know where to take the patient. Precious time is lost when a victim is taken to one hospital from other," said Dr  , vice-president of Medical Teachers' Association.
 
 He suggested awareness could be increased by installing hoardings with information about trauma centres or hospitals available in the vicinity. Advertisements on FM radio channels, electronic and social media also help increase awareness.
 
 He said presence of experts for MRI scan and other technical works increase of the chances of saving lives.
 
 Dr B N   said the city was well-equipped with emergency services.
 
  "There are 200 hospitals across the city catering to the need. Besides, there are 500 108 ambulances and 900 Janani   across the state," said Chauhan. He said results would come only when facilities are increased. "There should be easy movement for emergency services like 108 ambulance," said Chauhan.
