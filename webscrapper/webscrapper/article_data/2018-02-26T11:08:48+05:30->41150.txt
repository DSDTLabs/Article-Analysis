Karthik Sennimalai from Namakkal rail users association stated that Salem – Namakkal – Karur section is 85 km when compared to Salem – Erode – Karur section which is 125 km. Further, trains running through Erode require locomotive reversal which is not required when operated through Namakkal. Thus trains will save time and distance, he said.
