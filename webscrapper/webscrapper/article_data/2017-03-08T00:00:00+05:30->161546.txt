Playing ‘then and now’ of a character in the same film is child’s play for  , who has taken up similar roles for movies such as Vikramadithyan and Ennu Ninte Moideen. The actress is doing it again in Prithviraj-starrer Vimanam, as her character has two timelines – 25 years apart.

  “She plays Prithviraj’s neighbour in the film and is one of those few people who genuinely hope that the hero and heroine’s love comes to fruition,” says the film’s director Pradeep M Nair, adding that Lena plays an equally prominent role as   in the movie.
 
  Meanwhile, Lena says that her character evolves along with that of Prithviraj’s in the movie. “I play daughter to Nedumudi Venu who is also Prithviraj’s mentor in the film. She is a warm person and shares a close bond with Prithviraj. As the movie has kind of a biographical note, my character too evolves along with his.” 
 
 Lena adds that she has just finished shooting for the latter half of the film, in Kochi. “The earlier span will be shot in Mangalore. On the changes in her look for the sequences, Lena says, “In terms of body language and dressing, my character goes through a big transformation. I put on some weight for the role, and also wore a grey wig for some of the scenes.”
 
  Speaking further on her role, Lena says that her character also has an element of suspense. “I always wanted to do such kind of roles and that’s what also attracted me to take up the film,” she says.
