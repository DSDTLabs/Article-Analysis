KOCHI: They were restless when they joined school two months ago. They first came to school in shabby dresses not bothering to bathe and were a disorderly lot who bullied classmates, if the teachers are to be believed. “We had a tough time to teach them how to behave, the need to bath everyday and other things. Now they are the brightest students in the class,“ said Roopa John, special language instructor in   commenting on migrant students, who were found pestering teachers with the demand to serve them `sambar' during school meal time.

 Roopa is one among the eight instructors appointed by the   (SSA) in eight schools for communicating with migrant students and their parents and to help other teachers. There are 49 migrant students in the school. Of this, 20 students who live in   joined on November 14. Since the district is witnessing a rise in the number of migrant children joining the government and aided schools, the need of such instructors who know both   and Hindi or other languages, has also increased.
 
 “We have 913 schools in Ernakulam. There are 2,053 migrant students studying in these schools. This year we have placed a proposal before the government for financial support for appointing instructors in 15 more schools. We hope the instructors will be available from block resource centres (BRC),“ said Babitha Deepu,   SSA coordinator.
 
 Teachers in Thrikkanarvattom school are full of praise for migrant students who excel in all activities. `We need to just show how to write a word on board. They easily understand it and follow our instructions.Now they come to school after bathing from railway station and wear uniforms we have arranged for them. When they come to class, they pester us to teach them something. They ask for books and pencil instead of gift. Migrants students are more brilliant than Malayali students,“ said K K Rasiya, a teacher.
