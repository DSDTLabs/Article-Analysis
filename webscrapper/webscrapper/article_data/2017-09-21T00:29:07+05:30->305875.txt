MUMBAI: A sessions   recently provided respite to a 30-year-old man who was caught for   in 2016 and was sentenced to 30 days in prison by a magistrate court. While reducing the sentence to seven days already served by the man, the court observed, “(There is) no   at the hand of the trial (magistrate) court as to why it was necessary to impose imprisonment as well as a fine amount. I conclude that imprisonment of 30 days is excessive.” 

 The court pointed out that the man had no record, indicating this was his second crime. It said the punishment provided under section 187 or Motor Vehicle Act, the charge under which the man was booked, was simple imprisonment or fine, or both. The court directed the man to pay the fine of Rs 2,500. 
 
 The   man had moved the sessions court after the Borivli magistrate court had pronounced the verdict on February 9, 2016. The employee with a corporate firm was arrested on February 8, 2016, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was released after being granted cash bail. The man told the sessions court that the following day he was present before the magistrate court without engaging a lawyer. He claimed someone told him that if he pleaded guilty he would only be fined. The man said he admitted his guilty and was shocked to be sentenced to 30 days in jail and pay a fine. 
 
 When he submitted the appeal before the sessions court, he sought suspension of sentence and bail. While seeking to be released, he told the court it would take time for the appeal to be disposed of. Both pleas were granted by the court. The court ordered for his release on furnishing a bond of Rs 15,000. 
 
 Challenging the sentence, he told the sessions court there were no medical papers to show that that a blood test was carried out by the prosecution. He prayed for leniency and urged the court to reduce the sentence.
