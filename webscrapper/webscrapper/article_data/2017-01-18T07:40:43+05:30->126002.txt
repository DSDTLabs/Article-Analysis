HYDERABAD: Special Judge Parthasarathy of the   in Hyderabad on Tuesday dismissed the petition of   that was seeking penal action against Vizag's Araku MP   for evading repayment of the 25 crore loan she had taken from the bank. The court however confirmed the two year jail term and 25 crore penalty awarded to her husband P   for availing this loan in the name of his company and for becoming a defaulter later. 

 A trial court at Erramanjil had earlier convicted Ramakoteswara Rao and acquitted Geetha from the case filed by the bank which charged both of them with wilful default. The bank argued that both of them as directors of   company availed the loan and evaded repayment. While Ramakoteswara Rao preferred an appeal against his conviction, the bank too preferred an appeal challenging the acquittal of the MP.
 
 The economic offences court which heard these appeals dismissed both of them. The EOC court also directed the trial court to issue a non bailable warrant against Koteswara Rao as he failed to appear before the court on Tuesday.
