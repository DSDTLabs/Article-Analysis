CHENNAI: Proceedings in the Justice Arumughaswamy commission, which is tasked with finding the circumstances surrounding former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death, took a curious turn on Monday with evidences being submitted regarding AIADMK leaders who were removed from party posts after 2011.

 On Monday, Kartikeyan, an assistant to   and her close aide V K  , was cross-examined by Sasikala’s lawyers. “I was shown clippings of Namathu MGR and asked about the removal of AIADMK leaders from 2011 onwards,” he said.
 
 Sasikala’s counsels have filed affidavits containing the press clippings of the undivided AIADMK’s erstwhile mouthpiece  , which carried Jayalalithaa’s statements ordering removal of party leaders Natham Viswanathan, O Pannerselvam’s son Raveendranath, R Nataraj, T Nagar Sathya, Thoppu Venkatachalam, V Maithreyan and K P Munusamy.
 
 “Why we have done this, you will come to know later,” said  , Sasikala’s counsel, indicating that they were laying the field for something bigger later.
 
 Sources said that the original affidavit filed by Sasikala states that she was removed from the party in 2011 due to former Thuglak editor Cho Ramaswamy’s machinations. This was confirmed by Pandian to TOI.
 
 Curiously, Sasikala’s counsel has submitted a memo, stating that they don’t want to cross-examine former IPS officers Amaresh Pujari, K Ramanujam, Thamarai Kannan and J K Tripathy; and Jayalalithaa’s two drivers Kannan and Iyappan.
 
 “These IPS officers were asked about Sasikala’s removal from the party in 2011. They have categorically told the commission that there are no audio recordings or tapes which show a conspiracy against Jayalalithaa by Sasikala,” Pandian said, adding that they have cross-examined only those people they wanted to.
 
 Of the 35 witnesses, 24 have been cross-examined and only a few more were left, Pandian said, indicating that they were in no way delaying the   as alluded to by the Justice Arumughaswamy in his earlier orders.
