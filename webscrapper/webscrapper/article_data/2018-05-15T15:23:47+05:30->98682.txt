LUDHIANA: The collapse of a retaining wall of Gill Chowk flyover on Sunday night has sparked panic among residents of Ludhiana, with many of them saying that a garbage dump located right under the flyover caused the wall to fall.

 Most residents said they had complained to the   of garbage eroding walls of the flyover, but no action was taken. “Rats, snakes and mongooses are a common sight under the flyover,” said Surinder Singh, a businessman in.
 
 He added that garbage had eroded the retaining wall which collapsed from both sides. “Officials, I guess, are waiting for a mishap,” he said.
 
 Another resident,  , said MC staff kept on lifting sand from both sides of the road, but they did not pay attention to the retaining wall. “Had they paid attention towards it, all this would not have happened,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, some residents even recorded videos of the problem of rats under the flyover. They said they sent similar videos to officials, but they did not listen. No official of the MC was willing to come on record.
 
 No councillor
 
 As Gill Chowk flyover acts like the division line between wards 50 and 51 of the civic body, no councillor tries to take care of it, said area residents. While   is the councilor from   51, Swarandeep Singh Chahal represents Ward 50.
