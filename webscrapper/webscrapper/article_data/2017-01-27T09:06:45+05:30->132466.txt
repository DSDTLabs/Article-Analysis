MADURAI: In a bizarre accident, a government bus driver was killed after he jumped off the moving vehicle anticipating an accident. The rear wheels of the bus he was driving had hit the median, a few metres before an unused toll plaza, on the outskirts of Madurai city, and disconnected from the vehicle. Anticipating a major accident, the 40-year old jumped off the bus in a bid to escape. Ironically, he landed in front of the front tyres of the moving vehicle, which eventually ran over him, killing him instantly.

 It was sheer miscalculation on the part of the driver as the vehicle came to a safe halt and all passengers escaped unhurt. With the rear wheels detached, the bus toppled as it came to a halt. Based on a complaint, a case was registered with town traffic investigating wing, which is probing the matter.
 
 The driver, Suresh, 40, was driving a government bus on Thursday morning with around 40 passengers on board bound for   in Madurai from Nagercoil. The accident took place at around 7.50am, when the bus was about to pass through an unused toll collection point on   in the outskirts of the city.
 
 Many of the passengers had been sleeping when the accident took place. The shaken passengers scampered out of the bus after it came to a halt.
 
 A police team shifted the driver's body to the Government Rajaji Hospital. A case was registered with   under section 304 (A) Â­ punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and 279 rash driving.
 
 Police sources said that Suresh was speeding when the accident took place. He was trying to overtake slow moving vehicles ahead of him, driving in the lane meant for vehicles travelling in the opposite direction.
 
 As luck would have it, a bus was approaching his vehicle at high speed. To avoid hitting the bus, he veered his vehicle. However, the rear wheels hit the median and detached from the chassis.
