PUNE: Four persons abducted a truck driver after beating him up and robbed more than 44,350 bottles of liquor worth about Rs60 lakh in the early hours of Wednesday at Khalad village near Saswad, approximately 40km from here.

 The suspects also robbed the truck driver’s two cell phones and Rs6,000. The abducted driver (33) found the abandoned truck in the morning along the   bypass at Tathawade. He approached the Saswad police on Thursday and lodged a complaint against the robbers.
 
 Inspector Krantikumar Patil of the Saswad police said the complainant worked for a transport company. He loaded 924 boxes of liquor in his truck on Tuesday at the company at Lonand in Satara district. He left Lonand in the evening to deliver the consignment at   near Pune.
 
 “When the truck reached   in Khalad village late in the night, the four men riding on two motorcycles blocked its way,” Patil said. The suspects dragged the driver out of the truck’s cabin and beat him up. “They then gagged him with towel and forced him inside the cabin. One of them took charge of wheel and left the spot,” Patil said.
 
 The driver managed to free himself on Wednesday morning and found that the truck was parked along the bypass at Tathawade. “When he checked the rear of the truck, he found that the liquor boxes were missing,” Patil said.
 
 The truck driver first approached the local police and then came to the Saswad police station to lodge the complaint. The offence has been registered under sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing  ) of IPC.
 
 Patil said, “The suspects might have shifted the boxes into another vehicle and fled. We are working on Some clues. We will soon arrest the suspects.”
