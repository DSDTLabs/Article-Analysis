HYDERABAD: Former minister and opposition leader in the   Md   on Saturday accused chief minister   of being a pseudo-secular leader. 

 
 "When all opposition parties are trying to unite against the Modi-led   government to save secularism in India, KCR is going in a different direction. He is dancing to the tunes of PM Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah because of his earlier cases that have been dug out by Modi. KCR is scared that Modi-Shah will pursue these cases against him," Shabbir Ali said.
 
 Referring to KCR's trip to Bangalore to meet   a day before his swearing-in, Shabbir Ali said that KCR did not have the courage to look into the eyes of Sonia Gandhi.
 
 AICC general secretary RC Khuntia said, "Modi should give answers to 41 questions posed by  . Modi has failed to fulfil his promise of bringing back black money stashed in foreign countries and failed to give jobs to youth," Khuntia said.
 
 The Congress leaders participated in 'Vishwasghat Day' rally taken out to observe Modi-led BJP's four years' rule.
