MUMBAI: The state board’s SSC   are lost in translation yet again. Teachers have pointed out several   in the   and sentence constructionin the Class X   textbook. They have also spotted an erroneous representation of the female reproductive system.

 Last year, similar errors had cropped up in the Class XII sociology textbook. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 This time, a Class X chapter tries to explain the objectives of disaster management but all five statements used are riddled with syntactic errors (see box). “The textbooks, which were originally drafted in Marathi, are lost in translation. Several other   errors can be spotted in the textbook, which is an indication that the content was not proofread,” said a former state board member. The chapter on reproduction, for one, has tagged a part of the male genital tract as female’s. 
 
 Teachers said errors take up extra time in class. “The state does not invite English medium teachers for translation. In our school, we read out chapters in class and make corrections while doing so,” said a principal, also a science teacher. 
 
 Sunil Magar, director,   and Curriculum Research, said, “The nature of the process is that the texts are first written in Marathi and then translated. There could be some mistakes in the first edition. We are open to suggestions. Mistakes should be brought to our notice. We will discuss them. If found to be valid, they’ll be corrected in new prints.”
