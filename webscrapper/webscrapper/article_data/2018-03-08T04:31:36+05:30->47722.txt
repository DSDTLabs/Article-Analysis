MUMBAI: The state government announced an   inquiry into the alleged Rs 600 crore   in the   department in which over 6,000 fake appointment letters were said to have been issued to teachers. A central scheme, Integrated Education for Disabled Children, was stopped in 2009-10, leaving 595 teachers in the lurch. Congress MLC Chandrakant Raghuvanshi said the 595 should have been merged into local bodies as primary teachers but some officials collected Rs 16-18 lakh to issue recommendation letters.
