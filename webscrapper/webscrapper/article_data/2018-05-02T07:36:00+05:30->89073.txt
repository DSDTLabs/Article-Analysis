Amritsar: A couple of days after Pakistani Islamist leader Abdul Rehman Makki used objectionable language against the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev, during a rally held at Multan, his brother-in-law and co-founder of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba Hafiz Saeed, who has a $10 million bounty on his head, has come out with a video to win the confidence of Sikh population of Pakistan.

 Saeed is aiming to appease Sikhs for his terror outfit’s political front Milli Muslim League (MML) that is contesting the general elections in Pakistan.
 
 In a video of the November 2008 Mumbai terror attack mastermind Saeed, which has gone viral on the internet, he is heard alleging that Sikhs were a highly oppressed community in India. “Sikh community is one of the most oppressed communities of the world and is forced to bear the government atrocities upon them,” he said.
 
 Saeed further alleged in the video that like Muslims, Sikhs were also a victim of state-sponsored terrorism. He also accused the Pakistan government of ignoring the persecution of Sikhs and extending a hand of friendship towards India.
 
 Intelligence agencies in India said Saeed’s recent statement has come in the wake of Makki’s objectionable utterings against Sikhs which could cause possible damage to the political prospects of MML in the Sikh majority areas of Pakistan.
 
 Saeed along with MML president Saifullaha had attended their party’s political convention at Nankana Sahib on April 28.
