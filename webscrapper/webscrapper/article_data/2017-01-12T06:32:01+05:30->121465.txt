AHMEDABAD: Unlike other states,   often wear a deserted look and   hardly encounter any delays in making their purchases. However, thanks to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit (VGS) 2017, there is an unprecedented rush at permit liquor stores at leading hotels in the city, making permit holders wait in queues – a rare sight otherwise. Estimates indicate there is a 30% rise in the number of   at permit shops in the city.

 “I had to stand in a queue for half an hour to get my quota of red wine, which on normal days takes me less than five minutes. It was unusual to see people from various states and countries queue up for liquor,” says Rakesh Bhatia, a permit holder. 
 
 “The number of customers at liquor stores has jumped by 30% due to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit. We have permission to keep it open for extended hours and this has also added to the rush,” said Narendra Somani, owner of the TGB Banquet and Hotel, Ahmedabad.
 
 “The rush is more after delegates return at around 4 pm and it goes on till closing time. Most delegates who are putting up at the hotel come in during the evening hours and approach the liquor store,” confirmed an official at Hyatt Hotel, which has a permit shop.
 
 Permit liquor stores across the city stocked up on premium liquor brands, anticipating hefty demand and rush. This includes single malts costing upto Rs 50,000, vintage French champagnes, premium scotch whiskies costing around Rs 25,000 and fine European wines costing around Rs 7,000, among others. Hoteliers believe this has also added to the rush at the stores.
 
 “There is demand for premium brands, especially those that are not available regularly. We don’t keep them because there is hardly any demand,” said an employee at a luxury hotel in Ramdevnagar.
