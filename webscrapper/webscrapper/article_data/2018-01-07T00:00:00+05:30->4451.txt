Actress   who played Kaitheri Makkam, the queen of Pazhassi Raja, in Mammootty’s epic movie Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja is all excited to join the actor again in  . 

 Directed by debutant Shaji Padoor, the film will see Kaniha playing a bold character. “I had taken a year’s break from films to concentrate on an entrepreneurial venture. I didn’t want to take up some random movie either so I waited. I learned the virtue of patience,” she says, adding that she feels lucky that the team found her apt for the role. “It is a powerful and pivotal character,” she says.
 
 Kaniha, who has acted in four films with Mammootty including Ranjith’s Bavuttiyude Namathil, will be teaming up with the actor after a gap of three years. “Mammootty is also a reason for me to choose the movie, apart from my character.” The actress will join the shoot of the movie at Kochi in the second week of January.
 
 “I feel 2018 is going to be a bright one. I am also joining Ranjith’s movie   which will be shot in London. It has Anu Sithara, Niranj and Shajon as well. Ranjit sir has always given a different dimension to explore as an actor,” Kaniha signs off.
