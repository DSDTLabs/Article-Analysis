LUCKNOW: The   survivor was brought to Lucknow along with her family members by a six-member   team and the   police on Saturday. She was taken to the Dr RML Hospital for her medico-legal examination.

 
 Under tight police and CBI protection, a gynaecologist at the hospital conducted age determination, gynaecological and X-ray tests, which took around three hours. Officials said that slides had been sent to the forensic science laboratory. Once the reports come, they will be handed over to the CBI.
 
 The survivor was accompanied by her mother, uncle, brother and two cousins. The survivor’s uncle said, “Six members of the family, including the girl, were brought to Lucknow in two cars. We left from Unnao around 9.45am and reached the hospital after 11.30am. The girl and her mother are inside and we don’t know what is being done.”
