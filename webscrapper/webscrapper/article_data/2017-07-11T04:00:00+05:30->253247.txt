Gandhinagar: Even as technical assessment by National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) found that beleaguered imported coal-based power plants of   and   are fit to be taken over,   on Monday said the the state government had no plan to invest in white elephants.

 The technical assessment of   run by   is likely to be completed in a week’s time.
 
 “Gujarat government has no plan to invest public money in any white elephants (referring to the stressed power projects),” said Sapariya when asked about Adani Power, Tata Power and Essar Power’s offer to sell 51% stakes in their respective power projects in state to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL).
 
 “Sufficient power is available in the state for current as well as future requirements. It does not matter much if they (Adani, Essar and Tata) supply power or not. Technical assessment reports have reportedly been prepared with regard to these power projects. If government of India wants to do some hand-holding, it can, but we will not do it,’’ he added.
 
 The Union power ministry has taken the stand that it is a matter to be decided by the stakeholders, including the state government, but it can do some hand-holding to prevent further power sector non-performing assets for lenders.
 
 Reeling under financial losses on account of expensive imported coal, all the three private players have offered to 51% stakes in their respective power projects in Gujarat to the GUVNL, the state-run power utility, for a nominal value of Rs 1 each. The GUVNL receives power from these producers under long term power purchase agreement.
 
 After the Supreme Court in April this year disallowed compensatory tariff to Tata and Adani to make up for costlier coal imported from Indonesia, these power producers have complained of financial unviability of the projects on account of expensive imported coal. They have also sought government’s help to resolve the issue.
