Lucknow: The growing population has created tremendous pressure on land availability which has led to shortfall in   units. As of 2014, the shortfall in housing units in UP was around 21 lakh which has grown more now. To cater to this demand, the NDA government has started the Pradhan Mantri Awas   to provide affordable housing units to urban dwellers. The first project under the Yojana was launched in the city on Tuesday.

 The project spread over an area of 10 acre is coming up on Kanpur Road, about five kilometre from Amuasi airport. “This is the first project launched under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna in Lucknow which has begun construction work already and targets to complete around 2500 flats by 2020. People would be able to get possession in next 3 years,” said PN Mishra, CMD of Parth Infrabuild Pvt Ltd which is handling the project.
 
 Being a part of smart city township, it will provide all smart solutions like customer portal, traffic management system, Wi-Fi zone, PNG gas, iconic tower, open and green spaces, optical fibre accessibility etc even to the lowest cost flats like LIG and EWS category. Under this smart city project, people can aim to get EWS houses at almost 40% cheaper price because of the Centre’s subsidy. It offers flats under EWS, LIG, MIG, HIG category and also gives many waivers on taxes because of central scheme. In order to avail homes, buyers will have to qualify under   scheme which has income limits for different categories. The EWS & LIG flats are priced between Rs 6 and Rs 11 lakh approximately.
