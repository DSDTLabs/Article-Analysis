NEW DELHI: It was a harrowing time for the family of Rashmi Rani Acharya, a 52-year-old   patient from Odisha, who went missing from   on Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday morning, she was found unconscious near Deer Park in  .

 Rashmi Rekha Acharya, a resident of Bhubaneswar, reached Delhi with her husband Jageswar on Tuesday morning. She has been suffering from a brain tumour and requires occasional treatment. Jageswar asked her to wait on the ground floor and went to meet a doctor on the seventh floor. On coming back after 45 minutes, he could not find her. 
 
 “He went to the security room to report the matter but the guards refused to help him and referred him to the Hauz Khas   station,” said   Acharya, a relative who stays at Malviya Nagar. The family also started looking for her. “We informed someone in the Odisha police for help,” said Sushree.
 
 The family and the police scanned the area till late in the night but could not find Rashmi. On Wednesday, an unknown person called Sushree and told him about Rashmi lying bleeding near Deer Park. “We reached the spot and the police took her to AIIMS Trauma Center. She has been treated for her injuries in the head but is still in shock,” said Sushree. 
 
 In the evening, Rashmi said a couple had offered her food and asked her to accompany them but she could not remember how she was injured or when she fell unconscious. The police are likely to record her statement on Thursday.
