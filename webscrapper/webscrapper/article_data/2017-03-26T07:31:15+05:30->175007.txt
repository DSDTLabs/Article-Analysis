CHENNAI: A public meeting is generally termed a nuisance by residents, mainly for the 'heat and dust' generated. On Saturday night, however, a meeting convened by the   at   came in handy for police posted there to nab two phone snatchers trying to flee on a two-wheeler. 

 Around 8.15pm, the two cruising on their bike snatched an expensive mobile phone from a man walking along Poes Garden. He was engrossed in a conversation on the phone when they snatched it and sped away. The victim raised an alarm and a few other road users, some on bikes, gave chase to the robbers.
 
 The bike-borne duo thought they had shaken off their pursuers when they ran into an impenetrable crowd on   in Teynampet. They couldn't turn back either. As the pursuing bikers pointed out to them, the police contingent deployed at the spot nabbed the two men. 
 
 They were taken to the police station and questioning is on to establish their identity.
