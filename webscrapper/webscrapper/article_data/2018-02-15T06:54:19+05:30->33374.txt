AHMEDABAD:   in Bhavnagar district have approached   protesting against the government’s efforts to take   for a thermal power project.

 Ninty-three farmers from Badi village near Ghogha town have sought a declaration from the court that the land acquisition proceedings initiated more than two decades ago, with compensation paid thereafter should be considered to have lapsed. The farmers are claiming that the land acquisition has lapsed according to section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
 
 They argue that the government paid compensation to farmers, but physical possession of land was not taken for more than five years. Hence, the government cannot take possession of the land now.
 
 Some 1,355 hectares in 12 villages was under acquisition for a thermal power plant, lignite mines, constructing a colony, ash dumping etc. for the Gujarat Power Corporation Ltd since 1993-94. The consent award was passed between 1997 and 2001 and compensation was also paid to farmers – Rs 48,000 per hectare for non-irrigated land and Rs 72,000 per hectare for irrigated land.
 
 The 30-year land lease conditions stipulated that GPCL would set up a power plant in two years and start using the land for raw material. The mining lease was executed in 2005, and Bhavnagar Thermal Power Plant (BTPP) was commissioned near village Padva in 2017. The farmers claim that the plant was to be commissioned by 2000, and the project was delayed for so many years.
 
 The farmers urged the HC to declare the land acquired in these villages as lapsed now because two conditions of the amended land acquisition laws have not been fulfilled. They have also requested the court to stop government officials from initiating action to take possession of the land.
 
 The court is likely to hear this petition on Friday.
