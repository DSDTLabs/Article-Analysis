LUCKNOW: It’s been three days since the   suspended its services after hostellers vandalized the place on Tuesday night over food shortage and poor quality, and since then the hostel inmates are having a real tough time.

 The focus of inmates has shifted from studies to survival and arranging food for themselves.
 
 The inmates of the six boys’ hostels have now demanded that the university should make some temporary arrangement till the mess services are resumed.
 
 “We are not allowed to keep heaters in hostels. There is no food joint near the hostel and hence we have to spend not only on having meals outside but also on transportation,” said BSc student   while ruing that his mess fees has gone down the drain.
 
 Another student Anand Krishna said, “The authorities are claiming that the services will resume in a week but what about our hardships. We are spending on meals even after paying the mess fees”.
 
 “I got late for lectures today as I was making arrangements for breakfast and lunch. Even for having a tea we have to go kilometres,” said  .
 
 “I would have opted for a tiffin service if the mess had not been a compulsion along with the hostel allotment,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, university authorities said that the decision on resuming mess services will be taken on Saturday.
