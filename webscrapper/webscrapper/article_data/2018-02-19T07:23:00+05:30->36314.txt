NOIDA: A 28-year-old   engaged by a   for glass work in a housing society in Sector 119 was found dead face down in the complex on Saturday morning.

 Sanjeev Kumar’s relatives have alleged that the contractor, originally a resident of Bulandshahr, was pushed off the balcony of Eldeco Inspire by some company officials with whom he had had a heated argument a few days ago. The police are trying to ascertain if Sanjeev was pushed or he fell to his death accidentally.
 
 The developer could not be reached for a comment.
 
 Kanshiram, the developer’s brother, said Sanjeev was on the verge on completing the glass work project in the housing society but was yet to get any payment. “A few days ago, my brother had had an argument over the issue with some of the company officials,”   said.
 
 According to Kanshiram, his brother had gone to work as usual on Saturday. “They took him to some upper floor and threw him off the balcony. My brother suffered critical injuries and bled heavily,” he said.
 
 Sanjeev was taken to a private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.
 
 Amit Kumar Singh, the SHO of Phase III police station, said a   case had been registered against six officials of the company. “It is not clear if he fell down or was pushed. We are investigating the matter,” he said.
