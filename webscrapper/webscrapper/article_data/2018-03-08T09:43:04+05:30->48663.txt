PANAJI: A development plan worth Rs 10 crore will be tendered for   school complex this month to construct a drop-off point for students to alight from vehicles right outside the complex. 

 Gates will be built at the spot to limit vehicles entering the complex, and the area inside will largely be reserved for pedestrian use. Plans are underway to construct a parking lot for close to 1,000 vehicles, harvest rainwater from a seasonal stream and plant about 170 trees within the complex that is expected to debut in June.
 
  
  
 
 Sidharth  , chairman of the task force for Cujira school complex, also announced that the complex will be named Deen Dayal   Vidya Sankul, Cujira, from now on with Upadhyay’s statue erected at the entrance.
 
 Kuncolienkar also said that in an attempt to find a solution to the traffic woes in the area, architect  , who has designed the EDC complex at Patto, was roped in to draw this new development plan. 
 
 Earlier in June 2017, major traffic snarls in and around the complex had led to students reporting late to school.
 
 Presenting the new plan, Deshpande said the circular drop-off point has been created for parents to drop their kids without entering the complex. 
 
 School buses and staffers’ vehicles will have a separate entry leading directly to the parking lot.
