VADODARA/ANAND: Can dairy federations which have experience of marketing milk products provide market linkage for bee-keepers? Yes, according to chairman of the   (NDDB)  . 

 Speaking at a national seminar on the scientific benefits of bee-keeping organised by NDDB and National Bee Board (NBB), Rath said dairy federations in the country can provide market linkage for bee-keepers to sell their products.
 
 The seminar was organised on Friday at the Dr Kurien auditorium at NDDB campus in milk city Anand. 
 
 Rath said engaging milk producers in multiple streams of income through different non-farm activities aimed at their livelihood diversification is important for building their economic resilience and well-being. Government of India intends to promote beekeeping in the country as a part of their initiative of doubling the farmer’s income. 
 
 Rath said that the strength of the dairy cooperative’s network can be leveraged for planning suitable interventions in bee-keeping for boosting honey production in the country and providing additional income to small scale dairy farmers.
 
 NDDB’s executive director Sangram Chaudhary said around 15 countries together contribute 90 percent of global honey production. The global demand for honey increased sharply at an average of 19,000 tonnes per year since 2010, primarily led by United States. “In India, as per 2016-17 estimates, about 30 lakh bee colonies will produce 94.5 thousand metric tonnes of honey,” he said. 
 
 NBB’s executive director Dr B L Saraswat suggested to converge the activities of beekeeping and   given the extensive coverage that cooperatives enjoy in rural India. Chaudhary facilitated a brainstorming session on possible organisation structure for bee-keeping within the cooperative framework.
