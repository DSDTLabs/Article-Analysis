NOIDA: Residents under Rajputana Vikas Sangathan (RVS) Noida wing along with the RWA federation met city magistrate   on Tuesday and handed a letter addressed to Prime Minister   as well as President   demanding a ban on caste-based reservation. 

 The residents pleaded a case for the upper castes suffering from economic oblivion and urged reservation for all poor people irrespective of caste.
 
 “Regardless of their caste, people like  , MP and president of Lok Janshakti Party and BSP supremo Mayawati don’t need reservation as they do not fall under the category of economically weaker section of the society. They are not poor and thus do not need benefits of reservation policy. If at all reservation has to be given, it should be given to the poor irrespective of caste as there are many upper castes Brahmins, Rajputs, Kashtriyas etc. who are living below poverty line and are in need of reservation,” N P Singh, president, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) and member of RVS wrote in the letter.
 
 RVS president S P Chauhan maintained that “Due to  , our country is headed towards division and confrontation between different castes. This defeats the purpose of unity in diversity and ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” said Chauhan.
