The   on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra DGP to conduct a thorough probe to unearth an interstate prostitution racket that came to light when 68 girls, including 18 minors, were rescued from brothels in Nandurbar in January last year. 

 A bench of Justice J Chelameswar and Justice   asked the DGP, who appeared before it in compliance of its order, that it seemed to be a case of well organised prostitution racket and proper inquiry was needed to catch the culprits and to unearth the systematic channel of human trafficking.
 
 Slamming the state police in the last hearing for not properly investigating the case, the court had summoned the DGP to appear before it. The court said all the girls came from six districts of Rajasthan and it showed that there might be a channel through which they had been pushed into the  .Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, told the bench that the DGP was personally monitoring the probe and he had talked to his counterpart in Rajasthan to conduct an extensive probe. He said an SIT had been formed to conduct the probe and the culprits would be booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. The court passed the order on a petition filed by an NGO- Rescue Foundation, which pleaded the court to intervene to protect the interests of minor girls who were rescued last year but were handed over to their alleged guardians without following the due process of law.
