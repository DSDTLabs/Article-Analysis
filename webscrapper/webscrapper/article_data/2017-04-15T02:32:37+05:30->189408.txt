NAVI MUMBAI: NMMC plans to resume free   sessions in popular games like kabaddi and taekwondo soon. These classes have been devised for young kids below 16 years during the summer vacation at the refurbished civic-run Rajiv Gandhi stadium in CBD Belapur for 45 days. 

 Each game will have a maximum of 160 children who will be trained free in their chosen games. Out of which 50 each will be selected on merit for further training on non-residential pattern throughout the year.
 
 According to sources, NMMC is the first such civic body to facilitate this training facility to tap the young sporting talent in the city. A sum of Rs 2.5 lakh has been proposed to be spent on the children’s diet, T-shirts and coaching. Cricket will also be part of the coaching programme. But except for civic school students, others will be charged a nominal fee of Rs 300 for the special training slot during the vacation period.
 
 After a gap of over one year, NMMC sports department has decided to train the kids free in these two games. The ground was taken up for renovation in March last year. As the turf is getting ready in the next few days, NMMC has started enrolling children for the training camp.
 
 “We have received good response for cricket. Due to encouraging demand we have fixed marginal fees to restrict the number,” said NMMC sports officer Revappa Gurav.
 
 Children will be trained in taekwondo and kabaddi on mattress in two batches—morning and evening. “This is good news that the stadium will have some activities after more than a year,” said a resident. 
 
  “By the end of the 45-day camp, 50 talented kids from each game (kabaddi, taekwondo) will be picked for annual training which will be on non-residential pattern. They will be provided with nutritionist, physiotherapist and psychologist. We are chalking out an appropriate plan.”
