NEW DELHI: Reacting to the Supreme Court decision to examine the validity of practice of polygamy, Nikah Halala, Nikah Mutah and Nikah Misyar in Muslim community, BJP on Monday said it is a serious issue concerning gender rights and the apex court adjudication will ensure justice to women.

 
 “After Supreme Court ruling ending the practice of triple talaq... we are confident that justice will be done to the Muslim women,” said BJP spokesperson and newly elected   MP, Sambit Patra. 
 
 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud agreed with a plea that validity of the practice needed to be examined in light of constitutional principles and issued notice to Centre to make its stand clear on banning the practice for violating constitutional provisions. 
 
 On Monday, CPM politburo member   said her party agreed there was a need for reform in personal law but they would have preferred the suggestions came from within the community than from outside. “The All India Democratic Women’s Association has for... said women under the Muslim personal law should have the same standards of justice as every other person governed by it,” she said. 
 
  spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi also said the party will take a stand after reading the Court’s order. Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev taunted the Centre in a tweet: “Go beyond tokenism @narendramodi ji & act on your own volition.”
