  : "We raided their vehicle and found Rs 5,300 in   of Rs 500 and Rs 50. All these notes had the same  . During primary interrogation, we found that they had received the money from a person in Delhi," cops said. 

 During their probe on Sunday, the cops found that the trio were earlier involved in circulating fake currency notes of old denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
 
 "The gang's modus operandi involved sending a team to cities with sample counterfeit notes. They would go to market and buy stuff using these notes to check whether the local people can spot the difference between the real and fake notes," cops said.
 
 Sources within the district police told TOI that they have taken the accused along with them to Delhi to unearth the racket.
