Bhopal: If you are a cab-commuter in Bhopal, chances are you have got into — or will get into — a defective   or an unreliable driver. The fortnight-long drive by Regional Transport office ( ) and police revealed a high number of taxis that had no business plying on the road.

 Every day, four or more taxis are found unfit or plying without valid permits, an RTO official told TOI. As many as 56 taxis were fined during the drive between January 1 and 15.
 
 The drive started on New Year’s Day across the state capital as the administration decided to crack down on traffic violators. Several traffic hotspots, including Hoshangabad Road, Board Office and Jehangirabad, came in for special scrutiny. Officials say fines totalling Rs Rs 23.53 lakh were collected in just 15 days.
 
 The team checked 1,532 vehicles, of which 357 were fined. Fifty-six of these were cabs. “These taxis include both IT-enabled and private operators. They were caught violating several norms of Motor Vehicles Act and were plying illegally. We were shocked to see a rising number of violators among cabbies. Within a week, we caught 25 taxis violating norms, who paid a fine of Rs 1 lakh. Then, we launched a special drive on January 15 only to check taxis,” said Girijesh Verma, regional transport inspector in RTO’s flying squad.
 
 The maximum fines imposed during the drive ranged from Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,200 and the most common offences were carrying invalid permit, driving without pollution-under-control certificate, outdated fitness certificate, and expired registrations. Police were surprised to see a high number of non-certified drivers behind the wheels and private vehicles plying as taxis illegally. As many as 65 vehicles were fined for overloading. Most of them were private intercity buses, autos and tempos. At least 24 vehicles were seized and Rs 6.74 lakh in motor taxes claimed.
