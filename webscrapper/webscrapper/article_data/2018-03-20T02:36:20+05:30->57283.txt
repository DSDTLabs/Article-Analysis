NEW DELHI: A group of men allegedly attacked a businessman near   on Saturday night and fled with his bag containing gold jewellery and cash after throwing chilli powder into his eyes. Sunil Kumar (58), who owns a jewellery shop in Chandni Chowk, claimed that the assailants also threatened to shoot him when he tried to resist them. 

 He alleged that police filed an FIR under weaker sections of IPC and that he now planned to approach senior officers for help.
 
 Kumar said he was returning home on his two-wheeler after closing his shop. As he crossed a traffic signal   Shanti Van, six men on three motorcycles intercepted him. While one of them threw chilli powder into his eyes, the others tried to snatch his bag. When Kumar resisted, one of the men allegedly pulled out a pistol and threatened to shoot him. Kumar relented and the men fled with the bag.
 
 “Cops told me that as I won’t be able to identify the criminals and that they would handle the case. They asked me to sign on a blank paper with the promise that they will take necessary action,” he alleged. However, Kumar claimed, that he later found that a case had been registered under sections of theft and not robbery. He also alleged that his statement was altered to mention that he lost his bag when he got off to relieve himself. 
 
 DCP (north) Jatin Narwal said an inquiry has been ordered in the incident.
