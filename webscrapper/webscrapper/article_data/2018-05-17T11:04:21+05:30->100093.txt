CHANDIGARH: The   ( ) of Sector 22 has proposed to deploy enforcement marshals in the city to monitor   and assist the demolition squads of the municipal corporation in their campaigns.

 GHRWS president   has stated in the memorandum that members of the welfare society can be deployed as marshals on honorarium to report encroachment and illegal vendors in the markets. “The enforcement marshals will work like traffic marshals,” he said. The society has asked the municipal authorities that when traffic police follow the rule to challan any vehicle parked on the footpaths, why the civic body wasn’t interested in taking action against the unauthorized street vendors that occupied the same roadsides.
 
 In the memorandum, the Sector 22 residents have asked the civic authorities to take action against the vendors who flouted the rules against encroaching upon government land. The society said that in Sector 22, it was an uphill task for the mail van crew to reach to the area’s post office, since street vendors had occupied the road leading to this spot. Residents said encroachment by street vendors was taking sheen off the reputation of City Beautiful.
 
 Another major issue that the society raised with the municipal authorities is that the land grabbers use vehicles as their stores or warehouses and, therefore, many parking spaces in these markets remain occupied permanently. Residents demand that roadside vendors be asked to clear the vehicles from the markets after winding up the day’s business.
 
 The society wants the MC to carry out random campaigns against encroachment in all affected prime areas of the city and make these drives more effective and meaningful by involving the RWAs concerned and agreeing to the proposal for deploying enforcement marshals.   takes the help of traffic marshals quite regularly. The society represents all 1,280 government houses of Sector 22, spread over 10 clusters.
