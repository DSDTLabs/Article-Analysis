TIRUVARUR: An abandoned pipeline, belonging to the Oil and   (ONGC) at Erukattur, reportedly cracked causing oil sludge spill in   river in Tiruvarur district on Thursday. 

 A senior ONGC official stated that there was no environmental hazard due to the spill and claimed that they notified the same to the pollution control board. 
 
 He further mentioned that the crack was only of pinhole sized and that oil sludge spill was minimal. “We have also removed the pipeline now,” the official told TOI. 
 
 In   and Tiruvarur districts, ONGC conducts crude oil extraction process. The oil, that is extracted, gets transported to the refinery at Narimanam in Nagapattinam district. 
 
 Reportedly, of the four pipelines at Erukattur, only three are being used for the oil transportation process. At this point of time, one underground pipeline, which has not been suspended from functioning for the past few months, cracked in the morning. It is said that some amount of oil sludge, which still remained, started to spill. Since the pipeline is along the banks of Pandiyaru, the oil got mixed with water. 
 
 Farmers and local residents from the nearby area soon thronged the place and checked the water and the level of oil spill.
