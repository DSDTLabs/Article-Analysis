MAPUSA: The state government’s ambitious greenfield international airport project at Mopa received a jolt on Saturday, with tourism minister and   legislator,   ‘Babu’  , stalling construction work. 

 Azgaonkar, who visited the site along with his supporters, claimed that the project would provide no benefits to locals on the employment front. 
 
 The minister warned   (GGIAL) — the entity that will build and operate the airport — that there would be an agitation if locals were kept out of the purview of benefits. “We feel cheated, we don’t want this project. Neither are there any employment opportunities nor benefits in allied activities,” he said. “I have stopped work, and workmen have been asked to vacate the site. Status quo will continue till the company comes clean on these two aspects,” he said. “Our visit to the site revealed that there is no involvement of   in any of the activities undertaken by the company. Even machinery for the project has been sourced from outside,’’ Azgaonkar said. 
 
 The state government, in October 2015, had added some clauses to the draft concession agreement for the project, making it binding for the concessionaire to train and employ 75 Goans. It had also announced the setting up of an aviation skill development centre. 
 
 In November last year, GGIAL handed over appointment letters and announced rehabilitation packages to one member from each of the 15 displaced families belonging to the Dhangar community. The state government had assured job guarantees to the farmers who had to part with their land for the greenfield airport. 
 
 There is an apprehension in the minds of the locals that it is very unlikely that unskilled local workforce will get any employment in the absence of the institutions promised to be constructed onsite, including a hospitality training institute. Azgaonkar later said he was given to understand that 100% employment will be provided to the locals by providing them proper skills and training.
