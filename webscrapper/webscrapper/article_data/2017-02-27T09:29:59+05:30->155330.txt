BHUBANESWAR: Petroleum minister   on Sunday blasted the   government for the latter 's decision to withdraw fiscal incentives to  ' s Paradip refinery. Dharmendra attributed the action to Naveen 's personal hatred towards him. 

 "I can understand Naveen babu 's state of mind now and his anger towards me. However, political rivalry should not influence decisions that may affect state' s interest , and that will affect the livelihood of   youths," Pradhan said at a news conference here. 
 
 Pradhan was speaking on the state cabinet's Wednesday decision to withdraw the provision of interest-free loan equivalent on sales tax to IOCL's Paradip refinery for 11 years, as mentioned in the MoU signed between Odisha and IOCL in 2004. The state had agreed to defer the collection of sales taxes from Paradip refinery for 11 years and would charge no interest on the pending amount after the moratorium period.
 
 "I request the government to reconsider its decision and honour its commitments. Otherwise it will send a wrong signal to investors and Odisha's industrialization dream," Pradhan added.
 
 The oil minister also released a letter sent by Sanjiv Singh, director of Paradip refineries, to the state finance department, which said that withdrawing the incentives at this stage when production has commenced is a breach of trust.
 
 Stating that Pradhan is trying to link the states decision on stopping sops to IOCL with panchayat election outcome, BJD spokesperson   said, "Odisha has been objecting to the interest free loan to IOCL since 2011. It was taken up with IOCL in multiple rounds before culminating in the cabinet decision on February 22."
 
 Deb said Pradhan is responsible for creating a false notion about jobs for Odisha youths at the IOCL. "The sales tax holiday was promised to IOCL on the presumption that the project may not be viable. However, the company made Rs 15,800 crore profit in the last financial year itself," Deb said.
