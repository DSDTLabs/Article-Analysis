PATNA: A Patna police team arrested Shankar Kumar Chaudhary and Vishal Raj alias Saurabh Kumar alias Ricky from Powai area in Mumbai in connection with the murder of   cinema hall owner Nirbhay Singh (58). The duo belong to Yarpur area in the city and was brought to Patna on Tuesday.

 Police also arrested one Mohammad Shabbir from Shanichara Mandir locality under the Bahadurpur police station area in Patna. All the three are in their 20s.
 
 Nirbhay, the owner of Uday Chitra Mandir at Bihta, was shot dead on September 15. Police had arrested Akshay Kumar (21) alias Prince alias Golu and Pappu Singh (50) for their involvement in the murder.
 
 Nirbhay was also the president of the Bihta Traders Association. Police said Akshay’s father Mukesh Singh had taken Rs6 lakh from Nirbhay a few years back and the loan amount was allegedly the main reason behind the murder. “Mukesh was killed on August 17 last year. Nirbhay had thrashed Akshay and misbehaved with his mother a few days back and asked them to return the money. Akshay confessed that he planned to kill Nirbhay because of that,” police said.
 
 City SP (West) Ravindra Kumar said Shankar and Vishal had fled from Patna within hours of the murder and took a ‘chawl’ on rent in Powai. “After they were arrested, police got information about Shabbir and he was arrested from Bahadurpur locality,” the SP said.
 
 He also said Akshay had paid Rs2 lakh to Amit Singh, who had arranged the shooters. “Shankar was paid just Rs4000 while Vishal was paid Rs10,000 by Amit for killing Nirbhay. Amit, along with two others, are yet to be arrested,” the SP said.
 
 He also said three countrymade semi-automatic pistols were used in the murder. But the weapons are yet to be recovered.
