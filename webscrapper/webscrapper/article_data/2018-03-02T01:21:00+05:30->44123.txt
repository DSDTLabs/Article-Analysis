Cleared/215 Words Tirunelveli: Women from the narikurava community have sought the intervention of the collector to get relief from police harassment so that they could continue their traditional beads business. Their demand comes even as the menfolk have made representations to the collector seeking loans to establish their business.  C Jothi, 21, says she is having a tough time selling handmade beads and articles at the Sankarankovil, Surandai and Tirunelveli Junction bus stands as she and fellow narikurava women are chased by the Tirunelveli district and the city police personnel. “They mistake us for pickpockets and thieves. Where else would we go? We have to continue the traditional business as we cannot establish a shop in a prominent place. We are losing business that we used to make for Rs 100 or Rs 200 a day as we are running from the police with our basket in one hand and child in the other,” she added. Officials in the district administration said that this issue has to be dealt with care and that they would discuss it with the police, as there had been incidents of people of the community having a nexus with criminals. Police sources said that they chase these women as many are indulging in creating nuisance to public at bus stands by seeking alms.
