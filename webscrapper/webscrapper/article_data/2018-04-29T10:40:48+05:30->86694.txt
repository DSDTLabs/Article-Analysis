MARGAO: Navelim Congress MLA   on Saturday denied allegations of having undertaken any ‘illegal’ land conversion in Cavelossim in South Goa in the Regional Plan (RP) 2021.

 Terming the allegations made by the organisers of Friday’s public meeting held at Lohia Maidan,  , as ‘defamatory and misleading’,   said he refused to ‘get into any confrontation by filing a defamation case against them as he did not want to discredit or criticise the movement since he, too, is against the RP 2021 as well as the Planning and Development Authorities (PDAs) and Outline Development Plans (ODPs).’
 
 Displaying an RP2012 map he clarified that ‘the areas in pink had been partly changed from settlement to non-settlement in the RP 2021. “It is 50m from the mainland. Seven to eight houses were eliminated as they were difficult to maintain.”
