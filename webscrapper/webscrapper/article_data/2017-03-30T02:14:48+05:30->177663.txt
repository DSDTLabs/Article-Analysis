MUMBAI:   and BJP MLA   on Wednesday raised the issue of validity of a 1995 circular related to acquisition of plots under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation ( ) in the legislative assembly. Ironically, he is under the scanner for a   deal in Pune by his family members, when he was the revenue minister.

 Khadse is currently facing inquiry by a single-member committee under retired high court judge Dinkar Zoting and a case is also going on in the high court. He had resigned after allegations of land grab and misuse of power over a land acquisition by his wife and daughter at Bhosari, Pune. 
 
 Khadse cited a 1995 circular issued by the then government which mentions that if acquisition of a land is not completed with three years then its stands cancelled. He asked the government to clarify whether the circular was still valid or not. “There are massive irregularities and illegalities in the land allotment of MIDC. Many plots of have been acquired but the documents still have the names of old owners,” said Khadse.
 
 Minister Subhash Desai said that since the matter was sub-judice he will not be able to give an answer. 
 
 Pune-based builder Hemant Gawande had claimed that Khadse had purchased land in the MIDC area of Bhosari at a paltry rate. However, Khadse had argued that the plot was freehold land. TNN
