PANAJI: The government committee, set up to examine why the   ( ) and Hospital missed out on doing a cadaveric transplant last week, convened its first meeting on Thursday.

 The meeting was inconclusive, as members of various GMC departments told the committee that the hospital is ready to carry out a cadaveric transplant even though a different picture is being painted about the entire incident.
 
 It was also suggested that the government should, without any further delay, establish a state organ and tissue transplant organization ( ) at GMC and also set up a crossmatch laboratory in the premier hospital so that it does not lose out on an opportunity to conduct a cadaveric transplant in future.
 
 A liver and two kidneys harvested from a brain-dead donor at   hospital,  , were distributed to patients in Mumbai last Friday.
