CHENNAI: The   (KF) has triggered a controversy over an   to the ministry of culture regarding lapses in renovation of its auditorium, Koothambalam, in January. 

 This was after it issued memos to five officials including ex-director Leela Samson as part of a move to fix responsibility for lapses in the work.
 
 The memos on which the investigative report was based, however, has been stayed by the Madras high court in two separate cases filed by  , an engineer at KF and  , a railway officer, who is also a former deputy director of the foundation.
 
 The Madras high court stayed the memo issued to Menon in December and ordered status quo in the case filed by Srinivasan in November. Documents show foundation director Priyadarshini Govind sent the comprehensive investigative report to the culture ministry on January 23. Though Govind could not be reached for comment, sources said the report was neither tabled in the governing board meeting on Saturday nor sent to members.
 
 Minutes of the previous meetings show state culture and tourism secretary   objected to disciplinary action against Menon, saying he was not in the organisation when the tenders were awarded. The memos were issued in September based on a CVC report.
