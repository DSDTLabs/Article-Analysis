 Gena Ram had alleged in his suicide note that he was being harassed by an   and other junior rank policemen for several years. "ASI Radha Kishan and Gena Ram were good friends, but in 2012, Kishan had filed a case of theft against Gena Ram and his family. A final report was also filed by the police in this case but Kishan kept challenging it in different courts due to which Gena Ram was under mental pressure," said an official.
 
 Several Dalit rights groups have been demanding immediate arrest of the guilty cop and proper investigation into Gena Ram's suicide.
