LUCKNOW: Always known as an unorthodox governor, Ram Naik got started two new traditions in a single day on Monday. 

 The first of them was start of new protocol while welcoming the governor before the start of the session. So, in a departure from tradition, Naik was received at the portico of the UP   by Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit, chief minister   and the chairman of the legislative council. They all formed a procession led by Naik to enter the Assembly amidst playing of bugle and national anthem.
 
 Before leaving for Assembly, the governor was accorded a guard of honour at   and then at the Assembly which is a new protocol as sanctioned by the President. This has never happened in the past. Even during the   government, when the President had sent his recommendations for the new protocol, it was not accepted. The issue of the uniform protocol was raised by Naik at the governors' conference in 2015 in Delhi. And he got it implemented when the BJP came to power in UP.
 
 Another new tradition he set was addition of two slogans in his speech. Naik today concluded his speech by raising the slogan of " Bharat Mata Ki Jai" and "Vande Matram" which were not there in the speech delivered to him by the state government.
 
  Normally, neither the President nor the governor in the states can add to or delete from the speech given to him by the government .The matter was once challenged in the Supreme Court also that the President and the governors be empowered to make their own amendments in their speeches in the Houses, but the apex court had turned down the petition.
