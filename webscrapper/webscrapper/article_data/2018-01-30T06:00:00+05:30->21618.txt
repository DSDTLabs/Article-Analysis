Kolkata: Though you will not find the word ‘GST’ printed in any bill at the International Kolkata  , it will be the invisible goliath that will control book pricing this time. This time, publishers have been forced to hike the price of books to accommodate the steep rise in making cost that they have been incurring ever since the GST has been imposed.

 There will be a 20% rise in book prices across sections since the publishers are shelling out more to composers, printers and binders. Take the case of printing, for example. A printer has to buy raw materials by paying 28% GST. However, he can charge only 12% while delivering the printed material to the publisher. The publisher sends the printed matter to the binder, who is charging 18%-20% while supplying the finished books. The publishers are in a bind because there is no provision for them to charge any additional GST while selling books.
 
 “We have no choice but to increase the prices. We are incurring huge expenses this time because of different GST rates that have been imposed on every stage of publishing,” rued Indrani Roy, joint MD of Mitra Ghosh Publishers. 
 
 Most publishers are cutting down on the number of orders as a counter-mechanism. “We are bringing out 70 new titles this time but instead of placing orders for 1100 copies, as is the accepted number one prints for every edition, this time every edition is 500 copies. We will whet the demand and then place more orders. On an average we have cut down on our orders by 25%,” explained Apurba Dey, spokesperson of Dey’s Publishing.
 
 Publishers and Booksellers Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee agreed that it is a catch-22 situation. While publishers have to bear its brunt, they cannot charge additional GST while billing buyers. “We are forced to hike the price of books by 20%-25%. How else do we keep the book business alive?” Chatterjee wondered.
