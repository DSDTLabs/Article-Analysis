NEW DELHI: Justice A M   of the   on Tuesday recused himself from hearing an appeal challenging a Delhi high court judgment closing the politically sensitive   payoff case as well as acquitting the UKbased Hinduja brothers. 

 Petitioner advocate Ajay Agrawal had filed an appeal against the HC’s 2005 verdict and kept the case alive as the CBI was not permitted by the Congress-led UPA government to challenge the decision in the SC. 
 
 Agrawal had filed an application seeking the recusal of Chief Justice Dipak Misra from hearing the case, claiming the CJI was under pressure to dismiss the appeal as senior advocate   had appeared before the Justice Misra-led bench in the last hearing and questioned the petitioner’s locus standi. 
 
 The petitioner claimed Sibal, also a senior   leader, had taken the lead in canvassing support for a removal motion against the CJI in the medical scam case. 
 
 On Tuesday, additional solicitors general Tushar Mehta and Maninder Singh informed the bench headed by the CJI that the CBI had filed an appeal challenging the HC’s 2005 verdict and requested the court to hear the appeal along with the pending one. However, the CJI informed the ASGs that Justice Khanwilkar wished to recuse himself from the case. 
 
 The CJI ordered listing of the appeals before “an appropriate bench of which Justice Khanwilkar is not part of ” on March 28.
