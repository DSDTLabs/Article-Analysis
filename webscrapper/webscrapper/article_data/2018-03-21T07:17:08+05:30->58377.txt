KOLKATA : The city could be lashed by a thunderstorm during the latter half of the week, according to the Met office. Conditions are turning conducive for one and it could strike between Thursday and Saturday. While thunderstorms have eluded Kolkata on three previous occasions — between February 26 and March 17 — this one could have a proper impact, said weathermen.

 “A circulation over Bihar and Jharkhand could start forming by Wednesday. There has been considerable moisture incursion and the conditions are turning favourabe for a thunderstorm. It is still early to predict the storm more precisely, but this could hit Kolkata with a greater intensity than the previous ones that gave the city a miss. We will have a better idea on Wednesday,” said GK Das, director of   ( ).
 
 Around a dozen thundershowers hit Kolkata between March and May. But all of them may not be nor’westers. They form and strike Kolkata when hot air spirals up from the Chhotanagpur plateau. It attracts moisture-laden winds from the  . When the moisture particles reach a saturation point, they form a cloud which is then drawn towards Kolkata by the highpressure zone that forms over the city following a scorching spell. On February 26, the city had been hit by a latenight storm that didn’t qualify as a squall. Last Saturday, too, a thunderstorm had been predicted. It resulted only in light drizzle.
 
 The conditions for the storm will ripen from the second half of Thursday. Depending on the movement of the circulation, it could strike anytime from then on.
 
 The city, however, could remain warm but dry over the next one week. “It has not been too humid so far. In fact, humidity had dropped sharply on Monday, which led to an evening chill. Over the next 24 hours, it could get more humid,” added Das.
