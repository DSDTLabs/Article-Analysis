LUCKNOW: In a setback to   in the state, the number of applications has seen a steep fall this year as compared to  . In fact, the number of applications this year is the lowest in the past three years. 

 So far,  , which is organising the BEd entrance, has received only 65,000 applications as compared to about 4.5 lakh applications received last year - a sharp decline of 3.8 lakh candidates. 
 
 The entrance will be held for 1.8 lakh seats in 2,400 BEd colleges in UP. The numbers are unlikely to shoot as only four days remain for the online registrations to close.
 
 In 2015 around 1.8 lakh candidates had applied and the figure rose to 2.3 lakh applicants in 2016. 
 
 "LU has been conducting BEd entrance test for three years, but the number of applications this year is the lowest," said state coordinator for BEd entrance  .
 
 He said the courses have received a poor response owing to shrinking job opportunities. There is more demand for Teacher's Eligibility Test (TET) qualified and for Bachelor in Elementary Education. "Candidates are opting for these two courses as they offer more job openings in government colleges," Khare added.
 
 Since the number of applicants was high last year, LU made the entire admission process online this year for the convenience of candidates. But even that has failed to attract candidates.
