Let no woman defend and diminish that right of my sisters and my daughters in this industry," Haasan said, while reacting to a statement by Bollywood choreographer  , who defended the prevalance of 'casting couch in the industry. 

 Kamal was responding to questions from the media at the end of Model Grama Sabha session his party organised to mark the 25th year of the enactment of Panchayat Raj Act.
 
 "That is another form of corruption in politics. We have to put an end to this, wherever it prevails," Kamal said, reacting to another query about Congress leader   saying casting couch exists even in politics.
 
 Having had enough on casting couch, Kamal Haasan appealed to the media to focus on the larger issue of villages for which the event has been organised. "We are in the process of casting a new state and place it on the progressive path. There is no couch here. Only the floor, the land. We want to make it fertile," he said.
 
 MNM will conest the local body polls in  , as and when they are held. The local body polls in the state, which have been delayed for more than a year, could well prove to be the electoral testing ground for MNM, which was launched in February this year.
 
 "Absolutely. That's what we are aiming at," said MNM president Kamal Haasan, while responding to a question from the media on whether his party will contest in local body polls, which have been delayed due to legal tangles over re-classification of wards under various categories.
