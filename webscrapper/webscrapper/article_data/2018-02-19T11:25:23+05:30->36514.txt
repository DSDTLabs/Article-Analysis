CHENNAI: R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran on Sunday accused the   of attempting to destroy the  . Speaking to reporters, Dhinakaran said Prime Minister   was worried after former chief minister J Jayalalithaa decided not to align with the BJP for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

 “The AIADMK decided to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections alone and brought out a separate manifesto. The party bagged 37 seats in the poll, which was hyped as a contest between Modi and Jayalalithaa. Modi could not do anything when Jayalalithaa was alive. So he has launched attempts to target the family members who were close to Jayalalithaa during turbulent times,” he said.
 
 He said either V K Sasikala or he himself could have become the chief minister immediately after the death of Jayalalithaa.
 
 “The leaders had then realised that OPS (deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam) became an agent of the BJP and urged Sasikala to become the next chief minister,” he said.
 
 He said that a majority of the ministers and MLAs of the party openly declared that they would not continue to accept Panneerselvam as the chief minister as he changed colours after the death of Jayalalithaa.
 
 Later, while speaking to reporters after attending a wedding ceremony at Ranipet in Vellore district, he urged the Union government to constitute the Cauvery Management Board at the earliest to implement the Supreme Court’s order on sharing of water among Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.
 
 He condemned Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah for attempting to prevent the constitution of the Cauvery Management Board.
