RAIPUR: Change is in the air. Days after an   caught attention by deciding to send his five-year-old daughter to a government school for studies in  , a Parliamentary secretary-cum-legislator has got his son admitted in a government school in tribal Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh, continuing the trend, now. 

 Pathalgaon legislator and Parliamentary secretary Shivshankar Paikra got his five-year-old son admitted in Class I at Shaskiya Prathamik Shala at Bangaon ‘B’ in Pathalgaon block of Jashpur district on Saturday. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Paikra said that though there’s no English medium private school in the region, he could have sent his son to some place else for studies, but he doesn’t want to burden his son, Kartikeya Kaurav Paikra who has been comfortable with Hindi language, with new language at a tender age.
 
 Paikra said that language is most important for development of brain and learning for children and if he gets admitted to a private English medium school, the family members won’t be able to help him in his studies. Moreover, his comfort is most important in language. 
 
 Denying being inspired from anyone, Paikra said that his two daughters also studied in government school initially and were later admitted in private English medium schools. While he admits that the condition of government schools isn't too good in state, he said that in his region, he was doing best he could to uplift the standard of schools. 
 
 Balrampur collector Awanish Sharan had recently got his little daughter admitted at a government school. While Sharan feels that it wasn’t newsworthy, he has in a way set a trend and has gathered attention from media and bureaucrats. Sharan is known for his commendable job in field of uplifting education system in Balrampur in past two years of his posting.
