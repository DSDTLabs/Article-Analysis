A bustling   looks like an ageing career actor who forgot to take care of herself. Years of neglect have left Bengaluru’s oldest commercial hub with unkept bylanes and encroached roads prone to floods while its bazaar keeps its charm intact.

 
 
  
 
 As voting day nears, Chickpet’s first choice will be the incumbent whose political career has more misses than hits. A nervous RV Devaraj of   hopes laying of sanitary pipes and supply of drinking water in slums pays back.
 
 The   and JD(S) candidates have resentment within their parties to tide over, for starters.
 
 BJP’s choice of Uday B Garudachar, who lost to Devaraj in 2013, over Hemachandra Sagar who had defeated the Congressman in 2008, saw the latter move to JD(S).
 
 Sagar’s migration takes away some sting from BJP but also dents his chances as a discontent JD(S) cadre, unhappy with a nonparty man getting the ticket, is unlikely to give him full support.
 
 Added tothis, another ticket aspirant from BJP, NR Ramesh, may also work against the party despite not having quit. He has made allegations about senior leaders joining hands with Devraj. It may still not be easy for Devaraj. The 15,000-strong trader community — mostly migrants from Gujarat and Rajasthan — appear to be in favour of BJP, while the Tigalas (15,000) and   (20,000) will need some convincing. Even if Devaraj’s slum programmes rake in 70,000 votes, he will still need most of the 40,000-odd Muslim votes for the numbers to add up.
 
 “In 2013, I barely had 15 days to campaign, and still secured more than 30,000 votes. Devaraj has not managed to transform Chickpet and that will hurt him,” says Garudachar.
 
 Sagar, who’s banking on his ‘Modernise Chickpet’ mantra, says it’ll be a repeat of 2008. Devraj counters, “Sagar won in 2008, but did nothing. Garudachar is a builder who can’t give his complete attention here. I’ll win.”
