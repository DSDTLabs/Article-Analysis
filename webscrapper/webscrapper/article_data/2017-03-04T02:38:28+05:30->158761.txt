NEW DELHI: The mystery behind the alleged suicide of Army jawan Roy Mathew is likely to be resolved with the help of a diary found on him, sources told TOI.

 Mathew, who was found dead days after he featured in a news website’s sting operation critical of the Army’s sahayak or ‘buddy’ system, claimed in his diary that the voice in the op video was not his, the sources added.
 
 In the diary, which is likely to be considered a suicide note and is now in police’s possession, Mathew wrote in Malayalam that it was “better to die than face a courtmartial”.
 
 He also penned an apology to his wife, other family members, and the colonel to whom he reported.
 
 Meanwhile, police in Nashik, where Roy’s body was found, are questioning other sepoys of his unit. The journalist who conducted the sting operation may also be questioned, sources said. The cops will also record his wife Fini’s statement to determine what he said in their last phone conversation.
 
 TOI had reported on Friday that Roy was crying while talking to his wife. He had reportedly also sent a text to the colonel in question that read “Sorry”.
 
 Medical examiners found no external injuries during Roy’s autopsy. His family has alleged foul play in Roy’s death. Police have launched an inquiry into the alleged suicide, and are seeking legal opinion on whether a case of abetment was made out in the given circumstances. The Army is conducting a court of inquiry into the entire episode.
