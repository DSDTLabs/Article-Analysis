HYDERABAD: In a rare surgery, a robotic spleen preserving   was performed on a 39-year-old male patient,  , by doctors at   ( ) Hospitals in Secunderabad.

 While the surgery is usually performed via an open surgery or laparoscopic approach, this time it was a robotic arm and console that was used to safely operate on the patient about 20 days ago. The patient was discharged within four days.
 
 Unlike those suffering from diabetes, the patient was diagnosed with high levels of insulin in the body, resulting in hypoglycemia or low sugar levels, which can trigger confusion, anxiety, personality disorders, aggressiveness, sweating, palpitations, feelings of hunger, dizziness and drowsiness and even seizures.
 
 “The robot, which was procured by the hospital in 2013, has two components — a console and a robotic arm. While the surgeon performs the necessary manoeuvres and actions on the console, it will simultaneously be replicated by the robotic arm.  , while it is commonly used for urological surgeries, is rarely used for a pancreatectomy,” said Ujwal Zambare, surgical gastroenterologist at KIMS hospitals.
 
 In addition to doing away with concerns about tremors in hand movements of surgeons during the operation, using a robot also ensures more precision, said doctors. “Meticulous dissection is extremely important in pancreatectomy. Robotic surgery, due to smaller incisions, causes fewer traumas to the body and offers greater surgical precision. Unlike traditional open procedures, robotic surgery means a shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, less pain and fewer complications,” said Daga Sachin V, consultant surgical gastroenterologist at KIMS Hospital.
