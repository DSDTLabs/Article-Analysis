 The accused identified as   was resident of the same locality and the victim’s family was known to him. The accused was caught red-handed by the locals and after a sound thrashing he was handed over to the police.

 “We are trying to find what exactly the accused was up to. We are also looking for   footage in the locality, so that they not only act as evidence in the court but also give us more clarity about the incident,” Hashmi said.
 
 Fearing social stigma the victim’s family avoided registering a complaint for a day, but on Monday an offence was registered against the accused and he was finally arrested.
