 isn't ready to talk specifically about the sexual misconduct allegations against her co-star and  ,   writer-director  

  
  
 According to report, the actress, who has been a champion of the 'Me Too' and 'Time's Up' movements, wants to make her experience dealing with Louis C.K.'s sexual misconduct allegations part of the broader movement against sexual harassment.
 
 While talking at the Sundance Festival, when asked about her personal experience and how she dealt with the scandal after working so closely with C.K., she said, "I could single in and talk about my experience, but I think it's more important to talk about the entire movement as a whole."
 
 She continued pointing out the progress already being made just by having these conversations at major film festivals.
 
 "I'm one of the hundreds of thousands of women in so many different industries that has a story. You could ask anyone in this room and all of us could give you 10 stories, I'm sure. I think it's just nice, the communication, and the fact that you asked this question at Sundance in a video suite, this never would have happened two years ago," continued Moretz.
 
 She also shared, "So the fact that it's a conversation and it's a question is monumental, and I think that shouldn't be looked past or looked over. We've all been through a lot of stuff, but at least we're communicating and people are going to be held accountable."
 
 In November, five women accused Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct. The next day, the comedian issued a lengthy statement in which he said it was all true.
