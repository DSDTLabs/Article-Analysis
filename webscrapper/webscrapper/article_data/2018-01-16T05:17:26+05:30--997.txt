NEW DELHI: Four people were severely burnt when a fire broke out due to leakage in an   cylinder in a JJ cluster in southeast Delhi’s Sriniwaspuri on Sunday night. 

 The fire department received a call around 7.40pm from Indira Camp-2 and four fire tenders managed to bring the fire under control in an hour. At least 17 more residents were also injured.
 
 The incident started at the house of Kishan Kumar   (46), an auto driver. His wife Leelawati was trying to fix the regulator on a new   when it started leaking. Leelawati panicked and put it out in the narrow alley, calling for help. 
 
 “The cylinder fell and the gas spread into around 20 houses,” said Manoj Kumar, whose sister-in-law Sadhna (34) is in ICU. As the gas spread, it caught fire wherever it found a spark. People were caught unaware as flames suddenly enveloped them. Most of the victims are women as most of the men and the kids had gone to a park for a birthday celebration.
 
 “We heard noises from the alley and thought kids were playing. But soon we could see the flames,”   said. A mechanic who fixes LPG stoves managed to control the leak till fire officials arrived but himself suffered burns. The injured were taken to Safdarjung Hospital. Many were later shifted to LNJP and private hospitals.
 
 Police said Soni and his wife Leelawati have suffered more than 50% burns. Kesanta, whose niece’s birthday was being celebrated, is critical while her neighbour, Sadhna, is in ICU.
