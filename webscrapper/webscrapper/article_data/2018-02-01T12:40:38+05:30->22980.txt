RAJKOT: Massive plumes of smoke were billowing from the warehouse on   highway, where fire had broke out on Tuesday evening, gutting huge stock of groundnut. 

 Twelve fire tenders continued to battle the blaze on Wednesday and nearly 500 barrels of water was used to douse the flames. Close to 1.35 lakh bags of groundnut worth Rs 28 crore was gutted in the fire. 
 
 Suspicion is growing strong that the fire was not accidental but pre-planned. Sources said that the groundnut stock purchased at minimum support price ( ) is difficult to sell and hence someone could have deliberately set off the fire.
 
 The district administration has decided to strengthen the security and install   cameras in other warehouses of Rajkot district. 
 
 The collectorate raided some of the warehouse early this month and revealed malpractices like substandard groundnut and stones and soil in the bags. 
 
 Nafed, the procuring agency, had written to state government to shut down some of the procurement centers outside   to curb the malpractice. District administration has also ordered an inquiry and given an application to   police to initiate criminal action against the culprits. 
 
 District collector   told  : “We suspect that some insiders are responsible for this massive fire. We are investigating all aspects. We have decided to install CCTV cameras in 44 other warehouses in the district and strengthen the security.” 
 
 Nearly 3.50 lakh quintal groundnut procured at MSP is stocked in the warehouses.
 
 Mobile phones of Nafed officials were switched off after the fire broke out but sources said this was the private warehouse hired by the agency for the procurement and no accident or fire insurance was taken.
