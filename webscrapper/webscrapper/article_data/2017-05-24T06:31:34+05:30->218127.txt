UDHAGAMANDALAM: Journalists were kept away from the function at   at Lovedale, near Ooty, in which   Pranab Mukherjee was the chief guest. The school celebrated its 159th Founder’s Day’ on Tuesday. 

  The President’s visit was confirmed by the school 10 days ago. Journalists were asked by the public relations officer in Ooty to provide their stamp size photographs and personal details for a special identification card. The school also verified the details with each reporter over the phone. However, till Sunday there was no sign of ID cards being issued to the reporters or information about the time of the function. The PRO, when asked, said he had not received any information from the school.
 
  When contacted on Sunday, Sangita Chima, headmistress, Lawrence School, told TOI, “As the security is so tight here in connection with the visit of the President, we don’t think we will be able to handle the press and other media. Hence, there is no invite for media persons.”
 
  However, sources at the   (DSSC) said, “A journalist attached to a leading English daily did not stand when the national anthem was played at a function in the college recently. Apparently this is why a decision was taken to keep away the media during the President’s visit to the school.”
 
  At the DSSC convocation ceremony on April 17, the reporter refused to stand up when the National Anthem was played. Though officers of the DSSC requested him, he did not oblige, according to DSSC sources.
 
  Later, an FIR was filed against the reporter under the Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act (1971) with the Wellington police station.
 
  On Tuesday, the press and electronic media persons of Ooty expressed their protest against being kept off the President’s function by standing near the Nilgiris Collectorate holding placards that read, ‘PRESS’, while the President’s convoy moved on.
