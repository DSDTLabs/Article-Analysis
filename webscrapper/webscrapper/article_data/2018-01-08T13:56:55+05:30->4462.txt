  UV ways
 
  Decor expert Astha Khetan says that ultra violet adds a certain depth to a space. Whether you are using a statement pillow, painting, accent wall, a few sprigs of lilac or a vintage rug – a simple touch of the magical hue is all you need to transform your space. Her advice: “The easiest way to start decorating with a new colour is to take baby steps and not go overboard.” 
 
  Ultra violet, with its bold and vivid blue, is a perfect match with raw materials such as concrete and natural wood. For statement corners, try ultra violet in different combinations; with sage green, lemon yellow, or vermillion. “In small spaces, avoid using ultra violet vertically like in curtains and walls. Use in small accessories on floor and below eye level,” suggests decor expert  . In large spaces, experiment with walls in ultra violet juxtaposed against contrasting furniture.
