LUCKNOW: City Montessori School has lodged an FIR with Thakurganj police station against former principal of   branch   and former lab assistant  . They have been accused of misusing CMS’s official letterhead for taking personal loans.

 
 “Bedi was dismissed on June 29, 2017. Later lab assistant Sheetla Sahai was also sacked when she was also found to be involved. Bedi wrote a letter to CMS director on June 23, 2017, stating that she would sell her house in   and repay the loans. Then CMS management, in the public interest, had refrained from filing any FIR against her,” said CMS public relation officer Rishi Khanna.
