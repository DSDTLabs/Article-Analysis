MUMBAI: The   on Monday declined to hear in public interest a plea that has urged for guidelines to prevent the misuse of the  , saying it cannot assume there is "wholesale" abuse of it. 

 A model (20) and a businessman   (34) against whom she had filed a rape case that was subsequently withdrawn had approached the HC in December 2016 to question sexual assault charges applied in cases registered after a failed relationship. They urged the court to frame norms for the police to follow in cases where a woman has repeated consensual sex with a man and then alleges rape after they break up. An earlier bench of the court allowed them to convert their petition into a PIL.
 
 But a bench headed by Justice   questioned how it can be heard as a PIL and added that the court cannot assume "gross or wholesale abuse of the law". The bench said any person aggrieved by the action of the police in respect of Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code can avail "all remedies open in law". And, also that the court cannot treat such individual pleas as affecting a larger interest. "This cannot be a PIL,'' said the bench. The matter will be heard as a writ petition.
 
 The state had filed its replying stating that it cannot frame such guidelines and added that if a complaint prima facie discloses an offence of rape, the police are bound to register an FIR.
