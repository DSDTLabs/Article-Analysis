WASHINGTON: US President Trump said on Saturday that former   chief strategist   “cried” when he fired him. Trump said this in a tweet while ridiculing a new book in which   is extensively quoted as being highly critical of him and his family.

 “(Author) Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used   Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!” the President posted on Twitter.
 
 The White House has described the book titled ‘Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House’ as being full of “misinformation”. In an interview, Wolff stood by the content of his book and his criticism of the president. “When you write a book like this, people regret what they said to me. But I will tell you, they said it.”
