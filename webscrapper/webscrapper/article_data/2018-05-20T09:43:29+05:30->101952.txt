CHENNAI: The release of 1,855   from Tamil Nadu’s prisons, as promised by chief minister  , is hanging fire after governor   asked for separate processing of papers of the prisoners. 

 Following a government order early this year, the chief minister announced that prisoners who have completed 10 years of imprisonment by February 28 would be given premature release. Officials at the secretariat confirmed that the governor’ office wanted the papers of remission to be processed separately for the 1,855 prisoners.
 
 “This is a herculean task, something which the   never insisted on in the past,” said an official, pointing out the one-strike release of 1,405 prisoners during the DMK rule in 2008. An intelligence official said the reason could be that the Centre wants to scrutinise the political background of the crimes the prisoners were convicted for. “In case of murders, the political background of the victim may matter,” said the officer. Jail officials said many prisoners were upbeat after the announcement, but have now started asking if there was a problem. “Many had packed and were waiting to meet their families,” said an official. If the Raj Bhavan decides to vet the list, some may be disappointed.
