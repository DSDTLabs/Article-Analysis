Bijnor: At a time when “adarsh gaon” (ideal village) selected in Bijnor have still not been developed, three new adarsh villages have been shortlisted in the second phase. These are Machchhmar village in Afjalgarh block, Tosotara village in Najibabad block and Swahedi Khurd in Mohammad Pur Devmol.       These three villages fall in three Lok Sabha constituencies — Bijnor, Nagina and Moradabad. All the three MPs have promised to develop their respective villages as model villages.        The selection of three more villages in the adarsh list comes at a time when Begrajpur village, shortlisted in the first phase, is yet to become a model one. Of the 43 development works that were to be carried out here, only 31 have been carried out so far.        Interestingly, two years ago, it was Nagina MP Yashwant Singh who had selected Begrajpur as adarsh village. This village was to have proper sanitation, pucca roads, a health sector, NRLM, drinking water and sports facilities to name a few schemes it was to benefit from.        Giving details, chief development officer Indramani Tripathi said, “There were 43 points on which work was to be done. So far, we have covered 31 points. The work by Jal Nigam and horticulture is going on.. There was no additional budget for this village. All development work has been done under government schemes. The work will be completed here soon. Besides, we have preparing separate development projects for the newly selected villages.”        Begrajpur village head Neeraj Tyagi said, “Several works like construction of a water tank and laying of water pipes are being done at the village. Our village has, a health centre, Some pucca roads have also been constructed. Some development works are yet to be completed. Apart from this, old power cables have been replaced.”            According to Nagina MP, Yashwant Singh, “I had called a meeting of respective officials some days ago and asked them to complete all development work in the village, I think, Begrajpur will become an ideal village. This time, I have selected Tisotara village.”            On the other hand, Bijnor MP, Bhartendra Singh, said, “Earlier, I had selected Shukrataal as an adarsh gaon and now this, I have selected Swahedi village. I am set to hold a meeting at Swahedi to take the opinions from all quarters of the village. Then, projects will be prepared.”
