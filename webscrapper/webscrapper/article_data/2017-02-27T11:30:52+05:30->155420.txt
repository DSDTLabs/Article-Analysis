LUCKNOW: Body of a 29-year-old man who was reported missing five months back was found in a   in the house of his maternal uncle where he used to stay in Hariomnagar   on Sunday. Neighbours complained to the landlord Janakraj of a foul smell emanating from the house and when police, with the help of sanitation workers found the decomposed body of his nephew Shiva, he said he suspected the role of Shiva’s wife Madhu Asthana alias Dolly and her relative Neeraj in the matter. Police arrested Madhu but Neeraj could not be traced. 

 Janakraj is resident of sector C,   and had let out his Madiaon house to Shiva, where he lived with Madhu of Wazirganj. Madiaon SHO Nagesh Mishra said during interrogation it came to light that Madhu and Neeraj had an affair since before she married Shiva and when he saw them in a comprising position on October 16, they murdered him and hid his body in the tank.
 
 Madhu filed a missing report and misled police that he had gone to Balrampur after a fight with her. She was, however, seen most of the time with Neeraj. Madiaon police circle officer Meenakshi Gupta said, “Efforts are on to nab Neeraj.”
