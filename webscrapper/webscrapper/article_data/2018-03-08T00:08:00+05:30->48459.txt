When it comes to   management, there are far more   handling organizational tasks than men across the globe. Of course, the patriarchal issues and gender biases still persist in our society. For instance, a woman is still being judged by her sense of dressing or who she has been accompanied by in corporate meetings. There have also been times when a womanâ€™s voice is paid lesser attention to by technicians or other teams at a production set, or it is taken for granted that women can't get a hang of technology. But none of these should be considered a hindrance, as women are much more efficient and diligent in handling administrative responsibilities. We need more women to take charge of things and stay assertive and positive.
