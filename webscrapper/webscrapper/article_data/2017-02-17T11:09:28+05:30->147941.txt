RANCHI: The global investors’ summit could well mark the beginning of a string of similar mega state-sponsored event designed to draw investment and attention to the state. Next on agenda for the state government is Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where non-resident Jharkhandis will be invited. In 2019 the state government plans to hold its second investors’ summit. 

 While concluding his address at the inaugural session of the two-day business summit, chief minister   announced, “Pravasi Divas will be organised from November 28 to November 30, 2018, for the people of Jharkhand who stay abroad. This will be followed by an investors’ summit in 2019-2020.” 
 
 Das seems to be following a model propagated by the Prime Minister  . As the chief minister of Gujarat, Modi had initiated the idea of inviting Non-Resident Gujaratis for a meeting in 2003 before organising the Vibrant Gujarat. Now, the PBD is celebrated in January every year to mark the contribution of overseas Indian community in the development of India. 
 
 PBD conventions provide a platform to the overseas community to engage with the government and people for mutually beneficial activities. These conventions are have proved to be very useful in networking among the overseas Indian community.
 
 During the event, individuals of exceptional merit are honoured with the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award to appreciate their role in India’s growth. In 2017 eight non-resident Gujaratis were honoured during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, 2017, held in Bangalore.
