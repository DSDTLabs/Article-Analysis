KOCHI: The construction works for laying pipes from Perumanoor to Karuvelipady pump house will be completed by March 20, said district collector Muhammad Y Safirulla. He was speaking after reviewing the progress of works on Sunday. 

 The works on laying new pipes replacing the old primo pipes were started on January 27 after resolving the issues between concerned departments. "More than 50,000 families in   can benefit from the new pipe-laying works. Foreseeing the drought situation, district administration was taking special steps under disaster management rules to speed up works," the collector said.
 
 The steps for replacing the pipelines to West Kochi were started in 2005, but the project got government sanction only in 2014 for Rs 10.75 crore. But the concerned departments did not give permission to dig roads for pipe-laying, resulting delay in kick starting works.
 
 The existing pipelines, transporting water from Chowara pump house in Periyar to Mattancherry and Kochi were laid in 1914. The distribution capacity of the Chowara pump house was 2.3MLD water at that time. When a plant was installed in Aluva, the distribution capacity of the plant increased to 225 MLD on several occasions.
 
 The water from Aluva plant has been pumped to Perumanoor pump house in 900mm pipe and from Perumanoor the water was pumped to Karuvelipady pump house in 700mm primo pipe. But when the population rose in Greater Cochin area and Kochi city, people in West Kochi deprived of getting adequate water.
 
 Though the   tried to replace pipeline works by placing under DFID (department for   development) and   National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), it failed to take forward.
 
 Now, the old 700mm pipelines from Perumanoor to Karuvelipady are replaced with new ones.
