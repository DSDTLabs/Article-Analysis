KOLKATA: The BA and BSc Part I results of   ( ), published on Thursday, saw below-par results. The arts performance was especially bad: merely 43% students managed to pass, making it the worst show in the last five years.

 Of the 64,543 candidates who appeared in the BA Part I examinations in July last year, only 27,475 made the cut. The 43% figure is a sharp drop from last year's 69%. A source said, however, that the results of 10,000 Bengali First Language candidates were "incomplete". These have been kept out of the pass percentage calculation for now. 
 
 Even the   were way below expectations, said a source. Of the 15,125 candidates who appeared, only 10,738 (or 71%) managed to pass, which is a drop from last year's 75%.
 
 Combining the two streams, only 38,213 of 79,668 students - or 48% - managed to secure pass marks. A source in CU said the matter needed to be probed. "We need to know why so many students have failed," he said. 
 
 Pro-VC (academics)   had a possible reason for the poor show. "According to the new regulations introduced from 2016, an Honours student has to pass all Honours papers as well as at least one general paper. Earlier, the Honours candidates were only required to pass the Honours papers. Similarly, students studying general (pass) degree course are now required to qualify in two general papers of three. Till last year, they were considered pass if the student could qualify even in one general paper," he said.
 
 A number of students said erroneous evaluation could have lowered the pass percentage. "We will have to seek re-evaluation," said a student.
