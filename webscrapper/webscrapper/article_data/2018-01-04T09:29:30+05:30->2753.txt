PANAJI: The Goa state pollution control   ( ) has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on   municipal council (MMC) in connection with burning of solid   at various places in its jurisdiction despite a national green tribunal (NGT) order not to do so. 

 The tribunal, in its order dated December 22, 2016, had prohibited burning of waste in open places and announced a fine of Rs 25,000 on each incident of bulk burning of waste, including at landfill sites.
 
 A citizen from  , Raj Vaidya, who had seen the burning of waste in the open by MMC workers, sent photographs to the board.
 
 In a letter issued recently, the board directed the council to comply with the tribunal’s judgment in the matter of Almitra Patel vs Union of India, seeking compliance with the solid waste management rules, 2016.
 
 Further, the board has directed the council to file a compliance report with regard to house-to-house collection of segregated waste within seven days. “We have issued the letter related to the fine for burning of waste and asked for a compliance report on segregation of waste, its treatment and disposal as per SWM rules 2016,” an official said.
 
 MMC is perhaps the first civic body to be slapped a fine as per the NGT order. The panchayats of St Cruz and Taleigao were penalized last year.
 
 “It is unfortunate that workers of MMC themselves are resorting to this unscientific and environmentally-harmful method of disposing waste,” Vaidya said.
 
 The open burning of waste continues across the state even as litter and garbage continues to be strewn by the roadside and water bodies.
