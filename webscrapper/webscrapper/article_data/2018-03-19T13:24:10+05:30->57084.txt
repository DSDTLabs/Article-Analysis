PANAJI: Union minister   will arrive in Goa on Monday to hold consultations with mining stakeholders, politicians and party members with a view of finding a solution on the mining issue.

 Speaking to mediapersons, Rajya Sabha MP and   state president Vinay Tendulkar said that Gadkari will arrive on Monday and meet BJP leaders to discuss how to resolve the mining issue. Gadkari will be on a two-day visit to the state.
 
 Tendulkar said said that Gadkari will meet barge owners, truck owners, machinery owners and representatives of mining companies. Gadkari will also meet the MLAs belonging to coalition partners. Tendulkar said that   legislators can also come and meet Gadkari as he is visiting the state as a union minister and not as a BJP leader. Tendulkar said that there has been a delay in resolving the mining issue as chief minister   is indisposed.
 
 Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik said that the Union and state governments are working in tandem to arrive at a solution, as the   decision has severely impacted mining dependents. "We have to resolve the issue in the interest of the public," Naik added.
 
 Last week, three BJP MPs had met Gadkari and BJP national president  , and had briefed them about the mining scenario in the state.
 
 The BJP on Saturday held a brainstorming session to discuss various solutions to the issue. During the meeting, one BJP legislator suggested that the government should form a corporation to operate the mines in the state.
