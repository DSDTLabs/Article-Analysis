KOLKATA: A woman was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly setting up her stepdaughter to be raped by an outsider. Police are looking for the man who has been absconding after allegedly raping the 22-year-old homemaker on Monday evening. 

 The incident occurred when the newlywed was at her father's home in North Dum Dum. The homemaker got married to a goldsmith four months ago. On Saturday, the couple went to the woman's parental home at Sahapara.
 
 According to the complaint, the survivor's husband and father were at work on Monday evening when her stepmother allegedly let a man into the house and rape her. "When I tried to resist, the man locked the room from inside and overpowered me. My stepmother didn't respond to my repeated screams," the survivor said.
 
 When her father and husband returned home, she narrated her plight to the duo, who accompanied her to   police station. "The woman will be produced in a Barrackpore court on Wednesday. We suspect the rapist is a local youth. Efforts are on to nab him," a senior police officer said.
