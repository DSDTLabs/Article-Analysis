BHOPAL: A tantric was arrested on Wednesday for inciting four men to murder a friend, saying he will make cash rain on his dead body. Tigers and leopards have been killed for such black magic rituals in  , but a human sacrifice is a first in decades.

 The case dates back to April 18 when villagers in Murjhat of Balaghat’s   area found a body sticking out of the sand on the banks of River Sarrati and called police. The victim was identified as a local, Kamlesh. When the autopsy said that he was beaten brutally and the strangled, police started checking who he was last seen with. They zeroed in on Kewal, Ramashankar, Chhannulal Gautam and   and arrested them on May 3.
 
 Their interrogation revealed a bone-chilling account of how they fell for a self-styled tantric’s claims of black-magic money and murdered a friend when they could not find a dead body. “They were asked by self-proclaimed tantric Kunjilal that they only had to bring a body to get as much money as they want. He told them that with the body he can make   from the sky,”   SP Amit Sanghi told TOI. 
 
 After failing to arrange for a corpse, the four invited Kamlesh to a booze party on April 11, said police. They got him drunk and started beating him when he couldn’t defend himself, say police. “After strangling him, they buried the body in the riverbank, under the instructions of Kunjilal who said that he will perform the puja for money after 15 days,” Sanghi said. 
 
 But a week later, parts of the decomposing body surfaced out of the sand and villagers called police. “The accused tantric was arrested today,” the SP said.
