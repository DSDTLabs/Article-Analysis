BENGALURU: The evaluation for II   started across 53 centres on Monday even as department officials said 30% of the lecturers did not turn up for the exercise.

 PU board director C Shikha said appointment orders for evaluation were sent to 24,054 lecturers, but only 16,000 turned up, indicating that 30% were absent. Additionally, notices will be issued to lecturers who did not attend the camps on Monday, she said.
 
 However,   general secretary K R Manjunath claimed 15% lecturers were absent for evaluation work.
 
 The lecturers had threatened to boycott the exercise to protest the 6th  , which they claimed, ignored their demands. The protest was called off on March 21 following a meeting with   Tanveer Sait.
 
 “This absenteeism has nothing to do with the protest as that was called off last week,” said Manjunath.
