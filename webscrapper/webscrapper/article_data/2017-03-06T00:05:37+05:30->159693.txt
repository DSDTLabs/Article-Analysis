Gurgaon: Rishab Sapra, a 15-year-old boy, stuffs a construction vessel with cement, gravel and water. Mixing up the components, he lets the mixture spread itself on a crater-ridden road and then caresses the mixture until the imperfections on the surface are smoothed out.

 Rishav, a Class XI student, is busy doing something which will benefit 3,600 villagers of   — a rural hamlet — little more than a kilometre away from the repair site. Every day villagers who use this road for commuting have to endure a bumpy and woeful ride.
 
 Residents of Bandhwari said the road has been in a dilapidated state for many years now, and the authorities have not at all been bothered to repair the road.
 
 As many as 35 students of Pathways School in Baliawas, Gurgaon have joined hands with Earth Saviour Foundation to mend the impaired road and gift the villagers a decent road, which has been eluding them since years .
 
 “This is a wonderful experience for me. I have never done such work. It is both intriguing and emotionally comforting since I realise it will benefit the people,” Rishav told TOI.
 
 Another student, Tara Nouri said, “I feel very proud to do something for the community. It is a lifetime experience for me.”
 
 Organiser Ravi Kalra, who heads the Earth Saviour Foundation, said he faced difficult in roping in students for the social cause since exams were round the corner. “But they were motivated enough to come out and work for the people,” Kalra explained. “Patients, elderly people and villagers face a lot of problem while crossing this road,” Kalra added.
 
 The villagers lauded the school children for their effort. “I feel proud that small children are repairing the road for us. Now, the authorities should wake from their slumber and repair all the other roads of the village as well, ” said S Sharma, a villager resident. 
 
 Kalra, too, expressed hope that this act of volunteering by the school students will draw attention of the municipal authorities.
