VIJAYAWADA: A  , carrying 38 passengers, made an emergency   following a   on Tuesday morning. 

 The flight (No. 2T200) took off from Hyderabad at around 6.40am and landed at the   airport at 7.05am. Forty-five minutes later, the flight was off to Chennai but within 10 minutes, the pilot requested the airport authorities for a "priority landing" due to the snag. "The pilot had requested for priority landing and we made the arrangements in 10 minutes," airport director   said. 
 
 However, the snag could not be rectified as the airport does not the have technicians' expertise. Some of the passengers waited for more than two hours before they made alternative arrangements for their onward journey. The TruJet management later made arrangements for Chennai-bound passengers.
