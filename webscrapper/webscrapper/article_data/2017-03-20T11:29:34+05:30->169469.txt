Dipika Kakar,  
Love can change you. I say that because it has changed me completely. When Shoaib came into my life, I wasn’t confident as a person and didn’t know myself well. He nurtured me into who I am today. We didn’t fall in love at first sight. We were friends, and we were both going through challenging periods in our lives. 
 
 Shoaib’s love has been the biggest transformation in my life. Love has that power. I am more confident and happy today. I’ve started writing poetry in Hindi – I’ve written some 20 poems. The right partner in your life can help you to realise your true potential. We all go through highs and lows, but connecting to a right partner can help us awaken our higher consciousness.
