They say a lot defines the way one uses his or her vocabulary. In today’s smartphone-crazy world, the same applies to the emojis that one often uses in   conversations. Everyone has a go-to emoticon — whether it is for an over-enthusiastic hello or for a non-committal response. And a special emoji, especially when talking to that special someone. Here’s decoding what kind of a Valentine you are, depending on the   you use... 

 
 
 You’re the one that everyone loves to be like. Your uber cool approach towards the idea of love and romance, as if it doesn’t bother you much, makes people envious of you. We wonder, though, if this chilled out exterior is a mask for the warm, romantic person that you’re protecting inside.
 
 
 
 You love to laugh and your choice of emoji proves that. You always look at the positive things in life and chances are that your sense of humour and free spirit will keep your relationship afloat when in trouble. Stay this way, though don’t allow people to take you granted as the designated clown.
 
 
 
 You’re the one who knows how to mask anything flirty or controversial with a clever one-liner. You can play the field and walk out victorious, without leaving the other person feeling played. You know how to multi-task (you know what we mean), and still not get caught.
 
 
 
 You are borderline romantic. You just need someone to tip you over to fall into this ocean called love. Unfortunately, though, you have inhibitions, which leaves you most often choosing a nonchalant response towards anything that revolves around love.
 
 
 
 When you’re in love, chances are that everyone else will know it before you do. Your expressions reveal more than what you want to tell, which can be both beneficial and worrisome for you. But fret not, it’s better to be lovelorn than to not have loved at all.
