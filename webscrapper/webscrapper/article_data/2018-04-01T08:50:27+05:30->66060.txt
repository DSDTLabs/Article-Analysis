JAIPUR : Long wait for drinking water for the residents of   ( ) will continue as the   ( ) has refused to provide financial assistance to the public health and engineering department ( ) for developing infrastructure.

 To supply drinking water from   in PRN scheme, the PHED has drafted Rs 256 crore proposal for laying transmission lines in north and south regions. After receiving a nod from the PHED technical committee, the proposal was forwarded to the JDA for seeking assistance. However, the JDA has bluntly denied providing funds to the project.
 
 “The proposal has been drafted to supply water in 800 colonies. As JDA would be collecting development charge from these residents of PRN, we have forwarded the proposal for financial assistance. But JDA seems in no mood to provide funds. Now, the matter will be taken up to state government,” said a senior PHED official.
 
 “Earlier, the JDA had provided Rs 60 crore to develop the infrastructure. However, the amount is not sufficient,” he added. An official informed that for north region, the PHED has estimated to supply 40 MLD of water per day from Bisalpur. The demand for the entire PRN scheme is around 85 MLD of water.
 
 According to the officials, the department has prepared a detailed project report (DPR) to supply drinking water in the north PRN region. However, the plan cannot be finalised due to non-availability of land. “To provide immediate relief to residents, we have decided to lay transmission lines. We have also prepared a Rs 700 crore proposal to lay internal lines but it has been not finalised yet,” said a senior PHED official.
 
 According to the previous plan, the PHED department had decided to supply water from Bisalpur to PRN scheme in two phases. However, since this proposal was time consuming, the department prepared a new proposal.
