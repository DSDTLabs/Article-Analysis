Erode: A goat was killed after a crude bomb went off in its mouth near Nambiyur here on Saturday.

 According to Puliyampatty police, the incident took place when Palaniammal, 68, took his 10 goats for grazing near an open pond at Kavilipalayam Vengalkadu village. 
 
 One of the goats suddenly bit something, which exploded with a loud noise. The animal was killed on the spot. Palaniammal immediately alerted the fellow villagers, who rushed to the spot and found two crude bombs. They alerted the Puliyampatty police, who defused the crude bombs that are often used to kill wild boars.
 
 The Puliyampatty police have registered a case and initiated inquiry. The reason for placing the crude bombs near the open pond was yet to be ascertained.
 
  “We have launched a manhunt for the person who placed the bombs near the pond,” the police said.
