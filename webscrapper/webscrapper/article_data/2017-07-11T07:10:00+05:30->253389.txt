GURUGRAM:   are upset with the recurring   in the area. Residents told TOI, for the last couple of weeks, supply has been very erratic.

 “Water is released in our areas at arbitrary timings,” said Gaurav, a resident of S Block. “Nothing is fixed. Sometimes   is supplied during the afternoon, but mostly it is during midnight hours,” Gaurav added.
 
 Gaurav said residents in S-51, S-52, S-53 and S-54 suffer the most. “The blocks that are ahead of these lanes get proper water supply,” Sakshi, another resident said. “By the time it’s our turn, the supply dries up and we are left without water. That is the second aspect of this problem. The first being that the supply is erratic.”
 
 Residents also said after 1-2 days without water, they have no option but to rely on tanker companies, which often take undue advantage of the situation and charge hefty amounts. 
 
 “They tell us there are also other residents in the line, so it will take them another 2-3 days before they can send a tanker. As a bargain, they raise the price by Rs 200-500 extra,” said Gaurav. 
 
 Other residents also said that due to arbitrary water supply, some households have employed attendants to collect water on behalf of them. “Since we get water supply during midnight hours, several residents pay around Rs 3,000 and hire people to stay awake all night and collect water,” said Kushal, a resident. “We cannot afford to pay so much every month, so we end up ruining our own sleep and stay awake to collect water.”
 
 When TOI tried contacting  , general manager (maintenance), DLF, for a comment, he did not take our calls. We will publish the comments if he reverts to us.
