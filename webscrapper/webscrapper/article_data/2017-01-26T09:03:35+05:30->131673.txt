AHMEDABAD:   has issued notice to the ministries of home affairs and external affairs over a petition filed by the wife of a  , who is believed to be languishing in a   for the last eight years.

 Gitaben Gohil, wife of fisherman Kalubhai Gohil from Jamwala village of Gir Somnath district, has urged the court to direct government authorities to ensure and secure Gohil’s release from the Pakistan jail and for his repatriation to India.
 
 The petitioner has claimed that Gohil went missing on November 17, 2008 after his boat met with an accident in the Arabian Sea. He managed to swim to a coast, from where Pakistani authorities captured him. Assuming him dead, the family had even performed his last rites. But in 2015, one of the fishermen who returned from a Pakistan jail, Kanubhai Gohil, informed the family that Kalubhai was alive and lodged in a jail in Karachi. Before his arrest, he had been enslaved by Pakistani fishermen for nearly six months before they handed him over to authorities by branding him as a spy.
 
 After unsuccessfully making several representations before the ministries over last two years for the release of her husband, Gitaben has finally approached Gujarat high court. She has complained that authorities have not made any genuine effort for her husband’s release. 
 
 “Adequate effort has not been given to effectively represent the case of the petitioner,” she told the court and added that Pakistan has not given any reply to the High Commissioner of India, who had sought confirmation of her husband's presence.
 
 After issuing notice to the ministries,   has posted hearing on this matter on February 1.
