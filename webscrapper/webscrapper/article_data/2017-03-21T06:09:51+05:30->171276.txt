THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   convener   has said that the front will project it’s ‘secular credentials and the achievements of the LDF government’ in Malappuram Lok Sabha by-election, where he said secular and democratic forces will come together to play a crucial role.

 “The LDF has also decided to launch a strong campaign in the constituency ensuring active participation of chief minister  , senior leaders, including V S Achuthanandan, and the entire brigade of LDF MLAs,” he said after the LDF meeting held here on Monday.
 
 Queried whether the poll result would be an assessment on the LDF government’s performance, Viswan reiterated that the government’s achievements would be projected during the campaign.
 
 Alleging a tacit understanding between the BJP and the UDF in the poll, he said the state was about to witness another instance of ‘infamous’ Congress-League-BJP coalition to defeat the LDF. 
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader  , in a statement on Monday, said the CPM was trying for a secret pact with the BJP, ‘to reduce the UDF’s winning margin’. “Both the CPM and the BJP know that they can’t win in Malappuram. So it’s their common agenda to see that the UDF’s majority is at least reduced,” he said.
 
 Chennithala also said CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Achuthanadan were alleging a ‘UDF-BJP coalition’, to cover up their move for such an understanding with the BJP.
 
 Monday’s LDF meeting also demanded the government for a speedy rehabilitation of chemical engineering students of TOMS College, Mattakkara, after securing the approval of AICTE for additional seats in other self-financing colleges.
