MANGALURU: Don’t panic next time when you don’t get immediate access to first aid in case you meet with an accident in Dakshina Kannada. Coming to your aid will be the staff of hotel and dhabha along the highways in the district who will turn into   in such critical times.

 Conceptualised by DK SP Bhushan Gulabrao Borase, the initiative is a result of his observation regarding steep rise in   resulting in injuries and loss of lives. The victims are not getting timely treatment as police and medical persons are finding it difficult to reach the accident spots on time. 
 
 “To address this issue the department has chalked out a plan to train the staff of the hotels and dhabhas situated along the highways to provide immediate medical care to the road accident victims,” Borase said.
 
 Police have already identified around 65 eateries on the B C Road – Gundya, B C Road – Charmadi and Mani – Kallugundi stretches.
 
 Borase added that to take this initiative further, the department is searching organisations who can provide first-aid kits to these eateries. Personnels of the police department will identify trainees. Selected persons of these eateries will be trained by the district health department officers. 
 
 “These people can reach the accident spot as quickly as possible and send the victims to the nearby hospitals after giving them primary medication,” he said.
 
 The reasons for increasing accidents in DK roads is due to unscientific road construction, lack of signboards, cat eyes, speed breakers, retaining walls and reflectors.
