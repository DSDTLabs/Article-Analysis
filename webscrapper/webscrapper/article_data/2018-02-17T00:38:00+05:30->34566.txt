Trichy: Understanding the threats that damaged pedestrian platforms pose to people, the urban local body has repaired a couple of these platforms. Trichy Corporation officials stated that they have exhausted the entire fund sanctioned in previous budget to promote the pedestrian platforms and added that the ensuing local body’s budget will focus on building basic infrastructure available for pedestrians.

 The pedestrian platforms running parallel to almost all the arterial roads remain are in bad shape particularly in Sasthri road, Williams road and Salai road with either missing slabs or massive poholes forcing people to walk on the roads. Corporation in the last few days repaired a portion of platform for pedestrians bordering the Royals road close to the Central bus stand. 
 
 Adjacent to the corporation’s park where the civil works for open gymnasium is underway, corporation workers replaced the damaged parts with RCC slabs.
 
 The pedestrian platform along the Bharathidasan Salai and Heber road near the district court complex was given an overhaul. When contacted, city engineer S Amuthavalli said, “We have been refurbishing parts of damaged pedestrian platforms. Since we have made use of the entire funds meant for establishing and renovating the pedestrian pathways, through the ensuing budget of the civic body, we will take up the civil works for pedestrian platforms at required places after March 2018.”
 
 The absence of pedestrian platforms was not only a demerit for walkers but also with multiple cavities and uncovered slabs, solid waste that get carried away by the wind lands in these drains and clogs them, adding burden to the sanitary workers.
 
 It may be recalled that TOI highlighted the poor infrastructure available for pedestrians across the city in a news report carried on February 9, 2018, titled ‘Trichy Unsafe For Walkers’.
