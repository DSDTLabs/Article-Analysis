Ahmedabad: More than 13,500 residential societies in Ahmedabad depend on groundwater for their daily requirements. An average Amdavadi household consumes almost 110 litres of groundwater per individual per day over and above the 150 to 180 litres per individual per day water supply rationed by the civic body. 

 A recent analysis of total dissolved solids (TDS) and acidic levels of the groundwater from 33 areas has revealed that the TDS levels were higher than the highest desirable limit (HDL) of 500 mg per litre. This study revealed how over-extraction of groundwater in the city has led to higher TDS levels.
 
 
 Areas like Vastral, Ramol Sardarnagar, Bopal had the highest amounts of TDS levels in groundwater used in residential areas. The study was carried out by associate professors of KK Shah Jarodwala college in Maninagar, Mihir Suthar and KV Kanjariya, Tejal Suthar, lecturer at government nursing college in Siddhpur, and Dhruv Talati, lecturer of Parekh Brothers Science College, Kapadwanj.
 
 “We have installed portable reverse osmosis machines in our homes that demineralize. But I am concerned, as to get 1 litre of RO water nearly 8 to 11 litres of water is drained, which leads to wastage of water,” says Prayag Joshi a resident of Sabarmati area and a student of a science college in Navrangpura .
 
 A Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) report of 2011-12 suggests that the high TDS levels may be due to the aquifer structure of the area. “Aquifer structure depends on the rock structure below ground that allows flow of groundwater. The mineral composition of the aquifer affects the quality of the groundwater as well,” said a senior GPCB official. 
 
 “The predominant ions of the aquifer like calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulphate and nitrate may affect groundwater,” he added. Presence of these ions in higher level leads to high TDS, hardness and alkalinity in the water.
