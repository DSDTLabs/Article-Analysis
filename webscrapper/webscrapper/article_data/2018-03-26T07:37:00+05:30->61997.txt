PATIALA: Six days after Sikh activist Bhai Gurbaksh Singh   died after jumping from a water tank, his mortal remains were consigned to flames at his native Thaska Ali Village on Sunday.

 The family of the former militant and members of the Sikh community had on Saturday evening agreed to cremate the body after the   government gave a written assurance of meeting all their demands.
 
 Refusing to conduct his last rites, the family members had been protesting against the state police’s move of registering a murder case against unidentified policemen. The family members demanded that a case of abetment to suicide be registered against the cops who were responsible for his death. They had also sought transfer of SP   Abhishek Garg and DSP  . They had also demanded that a magisterial probe ordered into the death of the Sikh activist.
 
 After long deliberations amongst the members of the Sikh community and representatives of the state government it had finally been agreed that all their demands would be met after which the family agreed to cremation.
 
 However, just before the body of Bhai Khalsa was to be cremated some Sikh leaders demanded a copy of suspension orders of the SHOs.
 
 Deputy commissioner of Kurukshetra S S   handed over a letter ordering a magisterial inquiry by Shahbad sub-divisional magistrate into Khalsa’s suicide, thus pacifying the protesting family.
 
 Khalsa had jump off a water tank on Tuesday while demanding release of Sikh prisoners who have already completed their jail terms. The family had alleged that the policemen present at the spot had forced him to do it.
