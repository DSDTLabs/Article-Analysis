Jagera (Ludhiana): Even as the two motorcycle borne assailants were caught in a CCTV footage fitted at the Sirsa Dera branch in village Jagera, police are yet to get more clues about their identities. While the total ‘operation’ by the assailants took half a minute, one of the assailants was captured while looking at a CCTV camera with his eyes under the glasses clearly visible.

 Khanna SSP Satinder Singh said they had formed teams to probe the case, and were collecting all technical data to get a breakthrough in the case. Sources said police officials were scanning footage of CCTV cameras to find out where the assailants came from, and then in which direction they escaped on their bike after the killings. “Till now, there is no information about any personal animosity, as the family had been stating that they had no dispute with anybody. We are looking at all angles, including terror,” said the SSP.
 
 Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Hospital said the post-mortem report indicated that Ramesh had suffered three bullet injuries (two in the shoulder area, and one across his temple), whereas his father Satpal had a bullet injury in the head and chest area. They added that the bullets were probably from a .32-bore weapon.
