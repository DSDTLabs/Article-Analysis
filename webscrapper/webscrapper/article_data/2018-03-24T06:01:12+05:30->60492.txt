LUCKNOW: In a major gaffe, a   ( ) question in physical education paper of BA/BSc-I on Thursday asked students whether SP  , the current vice-chancellor (VC), was the varsity’s VC. The students had to answer the objective-type question in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.

 Admitting that it was a lapse on the part of the university’s moderation committee, which clears all question papers, LU officials clarified that the question had connection with the physical education syllabus.
 
 Controller of examination AK   has sought an explanation from the paper-setter. If the explanation was found to be unsatisfactory, then action might be taken against the paper-setter concerned, said LU spokesman  .
 
 “A panel of the board of studies suggests the name of the professor or subject expert who frames the question paper. Next, it is crosschecked by the moderation committee,” said an LU official.
 
 In another blooper, two compulsory questions were found missing from the varsity’s BA final English paper. The missing questions, carrying two marks each, were later manually added and dictated when authorities noticed the blunder. After the lapses were spotted, Lucknow University officials had to pass telephonic instructions to principals and examination superintendents at 25 centres.
 
 
 On March 20, BCom-I question paper made headlines for a question on the   government’s schemes.
