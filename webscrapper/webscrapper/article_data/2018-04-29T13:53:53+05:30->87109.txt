INDORE: Pithampur   on Saturday registered a case of criminal intimidation against a man for making   posts   to kill policemen and unleashing a reign of terror if police fail to find his wife and three sons who went missing three years ago.

 Police have also made a special team and contacted cyber experts to trace the accused, who identified himself as  , on social media and claimed to have taken the step due to promptness shown by police in catching alleged molesters of a model, after she took to social media.
 
 “We have booked Shekhar Singh for criminal intimidation and defamation for threatening to kill policemen through social media posts. We are trying to ascertain his location and catch him,” additional SP Sachin Sharma told reporters.
 
 Singh had also accused the police of taking bribe to trace his sons.
 
 “If police can find the molesters of the model from scratch, why can’t they find my kids? I have taken to Twitter to let people know, like the model did. I am left with no option other than giving police a month’s time, before I enter the world of crime,” Sudhir Singh had told TOI. He created Twitter ID two months ago.
 
 Singh, who worked as a dumper driver in Pithampur, says his wife Parveen Pathan and sons Prem, Karan and Aditya — then aged between 18 months and 5 years — disappeared when he was out on work in October 2015. 
 
 Pithampur Sector 1 police station in-charge   confirmed that a missing persons’ complaint was lodged regarding the kids and their mother. “We have received threatening calls from Shekhar, who we believe has lost his mind,” Dudhi said.
 
 Singh, who moved to Pithampur after marrying Parveen in 2010, said a separate missing complaint has been filed by her mother at her native city, Pune. He says he has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
