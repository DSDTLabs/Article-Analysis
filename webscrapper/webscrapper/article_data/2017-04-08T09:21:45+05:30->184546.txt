NEW DELHI: Journalist   was attacked by a 22-year-old youth from a nearby JJ cluster, Delhi Police has said.

 The youth named Sanjay, a   and an alcoholic, would often come to the park and watch Kalra walk. On Wednesday, this worker at a nail paint factory had a few drinks and came to the park. 
 
 Joint CP (northern range) Rajesh Khurana said Sanjay accosted her in a bid to initiate a conversation with Kalra. But as his speech was incoherent, Kalra shunned him. Enraged at being snubbed that way, Sanjay picked up a piece of rock lying nearby and hit Kalra on the head. Seeing her fall, he fled the spot. 
 
 As a badly injured Kalra was hospitalised, police rounded up the petty criminals of the area and questioned them. Police scanned through CCTV footage of the surrounding area and took note of the people who frequented the spot between 5.50pm and 6.30pm. By Thursday evening, police zeroed in on Sanjay and two others. The three were detained.
 
 The other two told the police that Sanjay used to visit the park regularly and drink under a tree near the spot where the incident occurred. By Friday morning, Sanjay confessed to his crime. Police commissioner   congratulated northwest district police for cracking the case in just 40 hours. 
 
 Meanwhile, Kalra has gained consciousness. Family members said she could identify her parents, but felt pain in the head. “An officer tried to record her statement, but she couldn’t recall the incident properly due to trauma. We will wait until she recovers a bit more,” said Prachi, her elder sister. She would undergo a CT scan on Saturday.
