Shah Rukh Khan, who is riding high on the success of ‘Raees’, has Imtiaz Ali’s next opposite   up for release this year. While   took to Twitter to announce the release date of the film – August 11, the movie which was tentatively titled ‘The Ring’ according to sources, has now been named ‘Rehnuma’. The word, which means guide or leader in Urdu, will have SRK essaying the role of one as well. 

  While the film was being shot in Prague, the working title was ‘The Ring’ as the film’s story revolves around Sharma’s character, who sets out on a mission to unearth a lost engagement ring, ably aided by a guide played by Khan. Another reason for the English title was apparently because of Ali’s love for English words in his film’s name. Now that the film has been christened ‘Rehnuma’, speculations with respect to the name can finally be put to rest.
