COIMBATORE: A six-year-old boy and his father were killed and another two of the family injured after the car they were travelling in crashed into a roadside tree near Sulur here on the early hours of Saturday.

 The accident took place when they were returning to their house at   after attending a church service at   near Sulur.
 
 The deceased were identified as C Thirulogachandar, 42, and his son T Daniel, 6. Thirulogachandar’s wife Ezhilarasi, 35, and daughter  , a Class VI student, were critically injured in the accident.
 
 Thirulogachandar, an investigation officer said, was a machine operator with a private firm in the city, while his wife was employed with a nationalised bank at Thiruvannamalai. Daniel was a Class II student, he added.
 
 “On Friday night, the family had gone to a church to attend night prayers. After the service, they headed back to their house in a car. Thirulogachandar was at the wheel. When the car reached Kurumbapalayam near Sulur Pirivu, he dozed off for a moment and lost the control over the vehicle, which crashed into a roadside tree,” the officer said.
 
 The front portion of the car was mangled completely. Thirulogachandar and his son died on the spot, while his wife and daughter sustained severe injuries.
 
 When alerted, the Sulur police reached the spot and sent the injured to a private hospital at Neelambur. While Ezhilarasi’s condition is said to be critical, Shivani’s condition is stable.
 
 The bodies were, meanwhile, sent to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. The bodies would be handed over to the family members after the autopsy on Sunday afternoon.
 
 The Sulur police have registered a case and further investigation is on.
