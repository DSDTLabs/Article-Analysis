LUCKNOW: Targeting the state government over the violence and arson in Kasganj,   chief   said on Sunday that law and order situation in the state has deteriorated under chief minister Yogi Adityanath. "The Kasganj violence shows complete failure of state government in controlling the situation," said BSP president.

 Demanding arrest of those involved in the violence that led to the death of a youth, Mayawati said that the incident was essentially a result of 'criminalisation of   and its associated organisations'. She said that despite the precarious law and order situation, the state government was taking back criminal cases lodged against BJP leaders in the past.
