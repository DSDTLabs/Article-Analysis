 ‘’I believe fashion is the politest way of speaking about sex—but I also like the subtle unspoken word which is left for the imagination of the wearer. The glamour and sensuality in this collection comes through the use of sheer and lucid fabrics, the delicate placement of embellishments, the drapes and the unexpected details and what they reveal or conceal, ” explains Suneet Varma.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 ‘’Evening couture is like a sixth sense of seduction. It has its own vocabulary and language, like an elaborate braid entwined with history, myth, and tradition. It may be modern, whimsical or demure but always magnificent like a Shining Star,” he adds.
