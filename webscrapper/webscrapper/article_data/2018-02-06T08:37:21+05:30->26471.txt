CHENNAI: The third edition of the   held on Sunday between IAS-11 and IPS-11 seemed like the most-awaited sporting event for government officials.

 The ‘grudge’ match, in which the   team lifted the trophy at the Marina Grounds for the first time in two years, had all the vigour of an India-Pakistan rivalry in cricket with an extra dose of in-service politics, gossip, jokes and fun. They won the match by six wickets, under the captainship of state environment and forest secretary Nasimuddin. His team scored 164 for loss of four wickets in 21.4 overs, while their opponents had 163/6 in 25 overs.
 
 Soon, the score card compiled by   Cricket Association went viral among IAS officials. On Monday, the IAS team trooped into the secretariat to show their trophy to the chief secretary  . “It was a friendly match. We enjoy playing this every year,” said Nasimuddin.
 
 But for many younger members of the team, winning the match seemed the most important thing. “We practised very hard for three days,” said disability rights commissioner Arun Roy. “So much so that I injured my back on Saturday and could not even play on Sunday.” Trichy sub-collector   who picked two wickets and scored 25 runs (not out) was declared the man of the match.
 
 But the winning team couldn’t help acknowledging some players in the   team – C Kalaiselvan, who was one of their best batsmen, bowlers Sai Shasanth, Mayil Vahanan and captain ADGP Sunil Kumar. “We lost because they played well,” said Kumar. “But thinking about it, they had a much younger team. Most had passed out after 2010,” he said.
