Panaji: Twenty-three recovered psychiatric patients, five male and 18 female, of the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour ( ), Bambolim, have found a new home at the Provedoria-run home for aged at Chimbel.

 TOI had reported in April 2015 that about 120 recovered psychiatric patients who were occupying beds at the IPHB would be shifted to the asylum.
 
 Then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had said that the families of these patients have abandoned them and are untraceable. Resultantly, the patients had been staying at the institute for an extended period. Due to this, IPHB has had to often send back new patients who need to be admitted, he had said.
 
 The inmates were moved to the Chimbel-based home in February. They have been currently kept together in rooms separate from the other inmates of the home. While the recovered male patients of IPHB have been given a room on the ground floor, the females have a room to themselves on the first floor.
