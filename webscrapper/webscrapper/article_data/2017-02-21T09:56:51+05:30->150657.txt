LUCKNOW: Two days after they were diagnosed HIV-positive, a   in their 30s committed suicide in the early hours of Monday. Residents of Preetinagar in  , the couple hanged themselves at their home, leaving behind a 10-month-old son and ailing parents. They embraced each other before taking the extreme step and police found it difficult to separate the bodies.

 At 2am, parents of the man were woken by the incessant wails of the little one. On going to the room, they found their son and his wife hanging from the ceiling with a stole tied around their necks. They called the neighbours who informed police on Dial 100. 
 
 Aliganj police circle officer Meenakshi Gupta said according to the man’s father, the couple were depressed after being tested HIV+ on Saturday. “We recovered some anti-depressant drugs from the room and   of the couple, though no suicide note was found. Bodies have been sent for post mortem,” said Gupta. 
 
 According to his father, the man used to work in a private firm in Delhi and got married one-and-a-half-year ago. In December, the firm transferred him to Uttrakhand but he went on leave as he was not keeping well and had developed rashes all over his body. He came to Lucknow along with his wife and son for treatment and was supposed to join office in Uttrakhand on March 1. When treatment did not help, he went to KGMU for complete check up. The couple were advised to go for blood test and they got the report on Saturday stating they were both HIV+. “I was shocked to hear about the test report and we were planning to go for expert advice for further line of treatment but before we could do that, they took the extreme step,” said the father.
