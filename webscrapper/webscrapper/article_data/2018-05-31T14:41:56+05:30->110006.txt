INDORE: More than 20   of   area displaced by Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) are bound to live in open and unhygienic conditions for the past one week in lack of   sheds. 

 
 The residents of the area have alleged that their structures were removed by the civic body, but they were not provided temporary  . 
 
 “There were 135 families whose houses were removed by IMC. While 115 families were given temporary sheds, 20 of us were not,” alleged   Singh, whose house has been removed. 
 
 He said that he had been living in the area for the past 40 years. “They came and demolished my house without any intimation. Now they have refused to give me alternate space,” he alleged. 
 
 Where am I supposed to go with other four members of my family, he rued. 
 
 Another resident, Ganesh said, “This is unfair. They have removed my house and now they are saying that we will have to make arrangement on our own. We have been living in this area for the past 45 years.” 
 
 Tamer and Ganesh are not the only residents, who have not been given temporary shed for living, there are 18 other families, who are left with no option but to make their own arrangements till they are allotted alternate space. 
 
 “Forget about the sheds, even the toilets that they have placed here are not up to mark. They are so dirty and insecure to use,” an elderly woman Vasu Bai said. 
 
 The civic body had on May 23 removed several houses in Bhuri Tekri area for rehabilitation of people under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. While the residents claimed that there were 135 houses, the civic body officials said that only 115 structures were removed. IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said that some houses had two or more families living in them owing to which this problem has aroused. “We will cross check the record of these families. If found genuine, they will be given temporary sheds for sure,” he said.
