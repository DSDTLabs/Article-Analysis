In May 2016, Prithviraj's much awaited family film 'James and Alice,' starring   as the female lead, had hit theaters.

 While the film was awaited with much expectations, it met a lukewarm response at the box office owing to a dragging narrative and overall preachy tone. In a recent interview, Prithviraj said that he can't help that some films succumb to such a fate. The actor said that sometimes, audience simply might not like a story that he feels is good or moving and there is no choice but accept it.
 
 The film was the directorial debut of Sujit Vaassudev and it also had Parvathy Nair,  , Kishore Satya and Saiku
