VASCO: A flower shop was   in Vasco on Friday, causing a loss of nearly Rs 15 lakh. The fire even damaged the walls and ceiling.

 At 5.40am, joggers noticed a woman residing in the building near St Andrew’s church pointing to the smoke from the shop, ‘Tender Hearts’, situated on the ground floor. They immediately alerted the fire services personnel who rushed to the site. The smoke grew thicker, so people from the flats above started evacuating the building.
 
 The shop’s shutter had to be broken open. Two fire tenders were used to douse the fire which destroyed material like computers, a laptop, flowers, and gifts were charred in the blaze. 
 
 Shop owner Christina D’Costa confirmed the amount of loss.
