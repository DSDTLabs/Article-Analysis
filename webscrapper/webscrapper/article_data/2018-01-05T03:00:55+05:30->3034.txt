NOIDA: Baby Rohaan, who was flown to India from Lahore for treatment weeks after his birth, will return home to Pakistan this week after successfully undergoing surgery to treat a rare congenital heart disease.

 Rohaan, now five months old, was brought to Noida on September 7 last year after his father appealed to external affairs minister   on her Twitter handle, the same oath other Pakistanis in health emergencies had successfully taken before.
 
 Rohaan was just five days old when he was detected with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Initially, his parents were unable to get an Indian medical visa. His father Muhammad Faisal Javaid, an IT professional, then appealed to Sushma, who directed officials to facilitate medical visas for the baby and the family.
 
 Javed, his wife Mehwish Mukhtar, a former broadcaster and lecturer at University of Punjab, Pakistan, came to India on September 7 with Rohaan and their elder son Mohammad Riayyan Faisal (3). Mehwish said the baby’s surgery was performed the next day by a team of doctors led by Rajesh Sharma, director of paediatric cardiology, at Jaypee hospital.
 
 Mehwish said doctors in Pakistan had told her surgery needed to be done within a month. “We were concerned for the safety of our child. We decided to approach India’s external affairs minister through a small campaign on Twitter. I am really thankful to the minister and the doctors whose attempts have saved my child’s life,” she told TOI.
