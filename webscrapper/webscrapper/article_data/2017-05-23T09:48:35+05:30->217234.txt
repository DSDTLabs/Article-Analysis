PANAJI: Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) chairman I   has assured chief minister   that all precautions would be taken to prevent an oil spill following the partial grounding of the 60,000 deadweight tonne floating dry dock at   Limited. To ensure that the situation does not deteriorate further, MPT has set up a 24X7 monitoring system, while Western India Shipyard has promised to remove any fuel present on the dry dock.

 “We have given the chief minister a briefing on the situation. He asked us for an action plan for the floating dry dock and we have presented factual data. We have now set-up a watch and ward system, where every four hours, we will be recording the position of the dry dock. This data will be reported to the signal station,” said Jeyakumar.
 
 On Monday, the chief minister sought information on the partially submerged dry dock and the grounded passenger vessel to ascertain the risk of an oil spill around Vasco. “MPT chairman has submitted that there is no oil in the WISL dry dock, but about 100 litres of diesel is present in the generator and WISL will remove the same by May 23,” an official from Parrikar’s office said.
 
 MPT will monitor the floating dry dock and the grounded passenger vessel MV Qing to see if there is a change in the stability of both the vessels or trace of oil in water. “We have laid oil spill booms around the vessel,” Jeyakumar said.
 
 Following a notice from the government, Western India Shipyard Limited (WISL) officials held a meeting with MPT to take stock of the situation. During the meeting it was decided that salvage operations for both the grounded vessels would be safe only after monsoons. 
 
 “The monsoon are imminent and there is no time to completely salvage the vessels. There is risk and if something goes wrong during the salvage process there could be an oil spill,” Jeyakumar said.
