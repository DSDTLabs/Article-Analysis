ISLAMABAD: Islamabad high court (IHC) on Wednesday granted permission to Uzma Ahmed, who was forced on gunpoint to marry a resident of   town in northwest Pakistan, to return to India. The court also directed the police to provide security to Uzma till the Wagah Border through which she would cross over to her home country. It also rejected Uzma’s husband   Ali’s request to meet her. “If Uzma does not want to meet Tahir she will not be forced to do so,” the court’s judge remarked. On May 19, Uzma had submitted a six-page reply to the high court reiterating her earlier claim that she was forced to sign the marriage contract. Claiming that Tahir’s affidavit was based on lies, Uzma sought permission to be allowed to travel to India as her visa would expire on May 30. The incident had surfaced when   lodged a complaint with the police to help him recover his wife, who went to the Indian embassy and did not return. Ali had met Uzma in Malaysia eight months ago.
