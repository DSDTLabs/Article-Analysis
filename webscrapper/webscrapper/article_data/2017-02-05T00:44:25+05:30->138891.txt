NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old employee of a well known IT company, waiting for her office cab outside her house at Nand Nagri in northeast Delhi early Thursday, was attacked, abused and   by two men.

 The woman had joined the IT company six months ago in the technical support division and used to leave for work at 4am. She usually received a call from the cab service operator hired by her company minutes before the cab arrived and had to walk up to the   point. However, she said that on Thursday she received a call from a landline number informing her that her cab would reach by 4.10am.
 
 “I got a call at 3.57am informing that the cab would arrive in 10 minutes. I reached the pickup point, but did not find the cab,” said the woman.
 
 “Every day a different car and driver are sent for the pick-up, so it is difficult for me to remember every driver,” she said.
 
 She said that after waiting for 10 minutes she decided to walk back home and inform the transport department. Just as she turned back, two men grabbed her from behind. “One of them tried to gag me, as the other tried to snatch my purse and mobile phone. I sat down on the ground to free myself from their grip, but they tried to drag me to a dark corner,” she added.
 
 The woman raised an alarm, following which the men threatened to slit her throat with a knife and forced her to hand over her mobile. She said that immediately the men disappeared in one of the dark alleys nearby. She went back home and called the PCR.
 
 “We have registered a case based on the complaint of the victim and initiated a probe. We will verify the identity of the caller who had informed her about the cab,” said Ajit K Singla, DCP, north-east. 
 
 Police officers would also approach the company where the woman worked and question them about flouting the safety norms adopted for women.
 
 The woman said that due to the trauma she could not go to work since the incident.
