PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body has demanded Rs 2 crore from   ( ) for the cost escalation due to the delay in completing the bridge parallel to   bridge on   in Dapodi. 

 Speaking to TOI, Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson for the Bus Rapid Transit System cell, said, “The civic body is constructing both the bridges parallel to Harris bridge. The construction of the bridge for vehicles to go from Dapodi in   limits to Bopodi in PMC limits is almost complete. The road on the bridge is being tarred. We will soon put up streetlight poles. All these and other works will be completed in the first week of June.”
 
 Both the bridges were to be completed by May 2018 but only one bridge is ready. Work on the other bridge for vehicular traffic from Bopodi to Dapodi had begun from the Dapodi side two years ago as land was available for the work.
 
 “We had to stop work after reaching the middle of the river six months ago as PMC has not removed the huts in Bopodi which are affected by the work,” he said. This would delay the project. 
 
 This will result in cost escalation which is wholly due to PMC so it must bear the escalation cost. “We have sent a letter to PMC demanding that it bear the escalation cost of Rs 2 crore,” Bhojane said.
 
 Vehicular traffic from Pimpri Chinchwad comes through six lanes and gets stuck in Dapodi as it has to make its way through two lanes of Harris Bridge to go to Pune and  . There had been a long pending demand for constructing the parallel bridges. Both civic bodies are sharing the cost of construction.
 
 Pimpri resident Amit Shinde said PCMC must complete the construction of the parallel bridge to link Bopodi to Dapodi at the earliest.
 
 Chinchwad resident Vasant Vartak said PMC must remove the huts in Bopodi so that PCMC can complete work on the bridge.
