KOLKATA: Calcutta HC has turned down Bengal’s prayer to stop the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha rally that resumed after a two-day hiatus on Monday on the court’s directive. The HC, however, held that BJP has to take the onus of any untoward incident during the rally.

 Trouble began since morning as the motorbike rally was flagged off on Vivekananda Road, 45 minutes late, when the HC had asked the organisers to stick to the schedule. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh added fuel to the underlying tension by some “inciting” remarks, prompting two citizens to lodge two separate complaints against Ghosh at   and Gariahat police stations respectively. Rally participants accused Trinamool supporters of leading a “siege” at Muraripukur in north Kolkata, on its way to Ultadanga. Trinamool supporters later waved black flags at rally participants as they passed by Chakdah and Ranaghat in North 24 Parganas.
 
 Around 150 bikers, carrying BJP flags, were waiting since 10am for Ghosh to flag off the rally. He came 45 minutes behind schedule, leaving court-appoint special officer   displeased. Kolkata Police led by joint CP (crime) Praveen Tripathi was manning the area to avert trouble. 
 
 The rally turned into a politico-legal issue yet again with the   government taking legal recourse to stop it. Advocate general Kishore Dutta mentioned the “illegal” rally in the court of acting Chief Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya and Justice Arijit Banerjee. He submitted that the rally had flouted the HC order on the ground that the court gave permission to  , a non-political organisation, when the rally was organised by BJP and was evident from BJP flags carried by the bikers .
