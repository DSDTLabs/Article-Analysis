CHENNAI: University of Madras registrar P David Jawahar has sent a legal notice demanding Rs 1 crore and an unconditional apology from economics department head Professor Jothi Sivagnanam for ‘baseless and untenable allegations’ against him in a TV interview.

 On January 30, after a TOI report highlighted a pending judicial inquiry against Jawahar over a Rs 5 crore financial irregularity, a private TV channel telecast showed Prof Sivagnanam making the charges.
 
 These charges, the notice from Jawhar’s advocate Narmada Sampath said, tarnished the university’s “image and reputation among students and parents and also put him [Jawahar] to shame and humiliation”.
 
 Sivagnanam should pay Rs 1 crore loss of reputation, social status and tender unconditional apology, failing which civil and criminal action would be initiated, it said.
 
 Sivagnanam declined to comment on the notice, but the Forum of   (PFMU), of which Sivagnanam is an office-bearer, submitted a representation to the Governor-Chancellor on Tuesday. “The registrar has sent a legal notice to pre-empt any action against himself for this irregularity,” an office-bearer said.
 
 The case pertains to a March 2016 university senate resolution calling for a judicial inquiry into the transfer of Rs 5 crore to building contractors from a UGC non-conditional grant exclusive for a nano-sciences project. Jawahar had admitted to TOI earlier that it was an irregularity but said he was acting only on the directions of ‘senior officials.’ He also said such transfers from UGC funds happened regularly. “Since there is no vice-chancellor, the inquiry has not been constituted,” he said.
 
 PFMU general secretary Professor S S Sundaram said the registrar had not acted as per procedure. “Every senate resolution should be brought to the syndicate. But this item has not been brought to the syndicate for a year.”
