Kochi:   Hills Plantations Co Pvt Ltd (KDHP) has withdrawn a petition filed by it before the high court challenging state government’s denial of permission to use its estate   for   purposes.

 The demand for withdrawing the petition was raised before the court and the court has allowed such a plea. Opposing the petition, state government had recently informed the court that the bungalows cannot be used for tourism as it violates legal provisions.
 
 In a counter affidavit filed in response to the petition, government had said that KDHP’s claim that it can use 5% of the land for tourism purposes as per provisions of Kerala Land Reforms (KLR) Act is misconceived as a special law, Kanan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act of 1971, is applicable in the case of these lands.
