VELLORE: The annual audit report of   for the financial year 2015-2016 has found discrepancies in more than Rs 100 crore expenditure incurred by the university.

 
 The audit report, a copy of which is available with TOI, said the university authorities failed to submit expenditure statements for Rs 67.59 crore incurred over the last 13 years starting 2003-2004. The audit report has also raised 574 objections to improper accounting for Rs 36.62 crore.
 
 Regional joint director of the local fund audit department  , on April 6 this year, communicated the contents of the report to the university’s registrar (incharge) and finance officer (incharge)   and asked him to “reply to the objections raised in the audit report within two months.” University sources said officials had not filed their reply to the objections till date.
 
 
 
 Paruvazhuthi could not be reached for a comment. Thiruvalluvar University authorities had taken an advance of Rs 31.42 crore for examination work and Rs 40.31 crore for other work. They “adjusted” or submitted bills for Rs 4.15 crore of Rs 71.74 crore, said the Local Fund Audit Department report.
 
 The registrar and finance officer released Rs 33.16 crore in 2015-16. Faculty members and heads of departments, who took advance, didn’t submit accounts (bills/ documents) for Rs 32.35 crore.
 
 The university has been told to submit account statements, failing which, the amount should be “collected from officials concerned with penal interest of 18 % as per Article 99 of TNFC (Tamil Nadu Finance Code).”
 
 The audit raised 574 objections, including 75 for 2015-2016, for Rs 36.62 crore.
 
 Inspector K Premnath of the local audit wrote letters on July 10,July 24 andAugust9,2017.“The audit on the expenditure of the university for 2015-2016 has commenced from June 29, 2017. Necessary documents should be submitted within three days of receiving the letter,” said Premnath in his first communication to Registrar (in-charge) of the university. The university authorities did not, however, respond to several official communications sent by the LFA department.
 
 On the appointment of 57 nonteaching staff against the sanctioned 22, the report said 35 people were appointed above the sanctioned posts. Hence “the above (38) posts’ salary and allowances need to be recovered”
 
 “In contra to the posts sanctioned by government, the university has created posts in excess and the appointment file and the Syndicate resolution passed in this regard were not produced to the audit,” the report said.
 
 The report also questionedthe university on non-maintenance of asset register and said, “As per the government instruction for all capital purchase and building made from all grants, a separate asset register should be maintained in the prescribed format.” The non-adherence of government guidelines/instructions has been brought to notice.
 
 “Corrupt officials holding key positions in the university have been swindling several crores of rupees,” said retired professor and former syndicate member I Elangovan, who added that the audit report was clear evidence of the wrongdoings of the vice chancellor, registrar and controller of examinations.
