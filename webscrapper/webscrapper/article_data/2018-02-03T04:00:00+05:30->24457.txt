The recent episode of Marathi   reality show 'Sur Nava Dhyas Nava' was a total dhamaal. Koli performers were invited in the show. And the show kicked off with contestant Aniruddha Joshi's Koli geet wherein he compelled audiences to sway along. The performance was entertaining that the judges Shalmali Kholgade,   Gupte and   Kale couldn't help themselves from waxing lyrical. Not only this, but they even took to stage to dance. What turned out to be a big surprise for everyone was the 'shy' Mahesh Kale who also went on stage to shake a leg. He became the cynosure of all eyes and floored everyone with his dancing.
