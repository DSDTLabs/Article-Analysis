BHOPAL:   whistle-blower   has alleged that Madhya Pradesh police has put him under 24x7 camera surveillance to torture him.

 Senior police officials, Chaturvedi alleges, have instructed personnel deployed in his security, to videograph all his activities.
 
 “Camera follows me till my bathroom doors. My mother and sister are living under tremendous mental stress with cameras videographing them, too. Breaching my privacy in the name of security, policemen barge into my house. They follow me everywhere with cameras. They follow even if I visit a shop to get photocopies, or even when I talk to anyone. This has led to my social boycott. On Monday, I tried to meet two people in the day and both refused to talk to me after seeing policemen with camera,” Chaturvedi said.
 
 When TOI contacted IG (Gwalior range) Anil Kumar, who ordered this 24x7 video surveillance on Chaturvedi, Kumar claimed surveillance is only for the situations when there is any dispute about misbehaviour.
 
 “There were repeated complaints from Ashish Chaturvedi that the security personnel misbehaved with him. But, security personnel on duty claimed otherwise. The order was given to ensure there is clear evidence. No video surveillance is ordered. It has only been instructed in times of dispute, videography should be done. I have not come across any complaint that he is being videographed round-the-clock. Now that it has come to my notice, I will get it checked,” Kumar told TOI.
