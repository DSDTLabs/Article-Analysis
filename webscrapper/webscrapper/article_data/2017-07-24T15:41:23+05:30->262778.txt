RAJKOT: A fully grown lion in Valadar village kept residents on tenterhooks in Valadar village near coastal town of Kodinar in Gir-Somnath district amid heavy rain.

 While the torrential rains were lashing, the villagers saw a lion feasting on a cow on the main raod.
 
 â€œThe people who had never witnessed the arrival of any big cat in their village earlier were stunned. From the safety of their houses they saw the lion had got near a cattle shed and killed the cow., said a forester from Kodinar range. 
 
 The lion did not move till Sunday morning and continued feasting on the cow in full view of the villagers, even as it rained throughout the night. In the morning, the lion got up and sauntered out of the village by the same route that it had come.
