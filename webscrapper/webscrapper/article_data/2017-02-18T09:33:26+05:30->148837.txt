KOLHAPUR: The left organisations, along with other progressive outfits and workers associations, are going to hold a march from Dasara Chowk to the   on Saturday. The rally is to condemn the delay in action against the masterminds behind the murder of left leader and veteran activist   who was allegedly killed by right wing Sanatan Sanstha.

 Dilip Pawar, veteran activist and left leader from the city, said, “Over 3,000 people are expected to participate in the protest march. Senior leaders such as ND Patil are going to lead the protest. The protest is against the state government's apathy to make satisfactory progress in the case. Even after two years, the case is going on and the masterminds are roaming free. The anger is against the apathy shown by the government.”
 
 The protesters are going to demand ban on Sanatan Sanstha through a petition to be handed over to the district collector Amit Saini. The petition will also include other demands such as protection to progressive leaders and activists, action against right wing leaders for controversial remarks made during last two years showing empathy towards the arrested Sadhaks.
 
 “The police administration is biased. When they find any controversial word coming out from the mouth of any progressive leader, they book them under several cases. We have seen that the office-bearers of the organisation under scanner have publically supported the murder and the police still allow them to hold public meetings,” said Pawar.
