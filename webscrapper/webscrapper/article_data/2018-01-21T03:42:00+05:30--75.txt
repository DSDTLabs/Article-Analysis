Calangute/Colva: Shack operators in the state appeared unaffected by the tourist taxi strike with some welcoming it for bringing in more business.  Shack operators along the Candolim-Baga belt and the Colva-Mobor beach belt said that it was business as usual as tourists who would have preferred traveling to the towns or to the spice gardens in Goa’s hinterland chose to stroll down the beach. “The taxis don’t have an effect on us. Most of the tourists are foreigners and stay in guesthouses close to the beach,” said the manager of Buddha Bay in Candolim. “Tourists who stay close by are used to walking.” Shack Owners’ Welfare Society (SOWS) president Cruz Cardozo confirmed that their business had marginally increased.  “As of now, there has been no impact on shacks. The existing customers have come and, in fact, business has increased,” he said. Shack owner Edwin Barreto said that all tourism activities are inter-related and that while tourists from South Goa head to the north, tourists residing in Calangute-Baga often head south for a day. However, since Friday, tourists have been forced to go to the nearest beach. Even watersports operators, restaurants, guesthouses, curio and trinket stores said that it was business as usual. The beach beds along the state’s popular beaches remained occupied by foreigners looking to catch a tan with a few odd domestic tourists joining them. “It’s not affecting us at all,” said John Lobo, general secretary of SOWS, who runs a shack at Baga. “That’s because tourists hire vehicles to move around. These same taxi owners also own hundreds of bikes and private vehicles which they rent out to tourists the moment they step out of the airport or railway station, so they can easily reach their hotels.” Requesting anonymity, a shack owner said politicians across party lines were trying to gain political mileage from the impasse over the installation of speed governors.
