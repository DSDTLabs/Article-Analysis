COIMBATORE: DMK party members will face legal action once the gutka scam inquiry ends, rural and municipal administration minister SP Velumani said here on Saturday.

 Refuting DMK working president MK Stalin’s charge that   was foisting false police cases against DMK cadre in the gutka case in Coimbatore, Velumani said that none of the AIADMK ministers or MLAs were involved in it. “The inquiry is being conducted independently and the truth will come out once it is completed. DMK will be left red-faced once   inquiry is complete,” the minister, who was in the city to attend a review meeting at the district collector’s office, said.
 
 Officials from departments including health, education, highways, airport, transport, railways and corporation attended the meeting. “We discussed about water supply shortage in summer. I have asked all officials to monitor water supply and ensure that complaints are redressed immediately. There is enough water for Coimbatore district until December and there is nothing to worry,” Velumani said.
 
 The meeting also reviewed Coimbatore corporation’s 24x7 water supply scheme.
 
 Talking about projects such as the flyovers, metro, bus port and airport expansion, the minister said the works were being carried out in a fast pace. “Once the airport expansion is complete, international connectivity will get a boost and industry development will take place,” he said.
