Chandigarh: A project worth Rs 2,500 crore has been approved for the city to replace all electricity meters with smart, interactive devices to monitor consumption and resolve peak-hour issues. Even the old water pumps that bring 80 million litres a day of water to the city from the Bhakra canal are being replaced with energy-efficient, star-rated equipment.

 To contain the transmission losses, all overhead power cables will be laid underground. The replacement of 50,000 streetlights with LED bulbs, and the distribution of energy-efficient LED bulbs, tube-lights, and fans to the people had helped Chandigarh save a lot of energy, UT chief engineer Mukesh Anand claimed here on Saturday during a PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry roundtable discussion on the management of electricity demand and efficiency.
 
 The chamber had Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation and MP EN Systems Advisory of Mumbai as knowledge partners. Senior representatives of state electricity departments and regulatory authorities from Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab, besides officials of the energy development department in Chandigarh, were present. The other stakeholders included state-designated agencies, technocrats, energy auditors, and industries’ association.
 
 “The UT Administration is trying to make the city energy efficient,” said Anand, who was special guest.
