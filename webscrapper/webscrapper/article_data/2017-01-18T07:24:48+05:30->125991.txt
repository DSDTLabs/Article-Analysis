AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the state government, Ahmedabad district education officer and the advocate general in response to a petition questioning the rules permitting 5-year-old child’s admission in Class I. The rules have been formulated by the state government under the Right to Education Act.

 Two schools —   and Zebar School for Children — had filed the petition highlighting discrepancy between the state government’s rules and the RTE law. They argued that Rule 3(1) of the   and Compulsory Education Rules-2012 formulated by the Gujarat government says that a child can be granted admission in Class I once he/she completes five years of age. But the RTE Act makes it clear that a child cannot be admitted in Class I unless he/she has completed 6 years of age on the cutoff date for admission.
 
 The grievance expressed by the schools is that the DEO asks schools to admit underage students under RTE provisions. In May last year, the DEO provided a list of 13 poor   under RTE but five of them had not completed six years on the cutoff date. The DEO cited state government’s RTE Rules-2012 which permit parents to seek admission for a child on completion of five years. The schools have complained that parents of other students had raised queries on admission of underage students. The schools have demanded that the  , which is in violation of the Act, should be scrapped. The HC will hear this case further on February 27.
