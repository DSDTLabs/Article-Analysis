In the early hours of Sunday, the world was greeted with the terrible news of legendary actress 
 . But a tweet posted late Saturday night by superstar   is sending shivers up social media's spine. A little after midnight, he wrote about feeling a sense of unease, tweeting in Hindi: "Na jaane kyun, ek ajeeb si ghabrahat ho rahi hain." 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 His tweet is now being seen by Twitter as an eerie premonition - hours later, the world learnt that actress   had died of a cardiac arrest in Dubai, where she and the family were attending a wedding. Sridevi, who was just 54, was Mr Bachchan's co-star in films like ‘Inquilaab’, ‘Aakhree Raasta’ and ‘Khuda Gawah’. Bachchan also made a special appearance in 2012's ‘English Vinglish’, the film that marked Sridevi's return to screen after a hiatus of many years.
 
 
 
 The comments thread on Amitabh Bachchan's tweet is full of responses from fans informing him of his former co-star's death. "Talk about sixth sense," reads one post.
