VIJAYAWADA: Major   rackets were busted across   last year after Krishna Singh was arrested and then   started cracking down on the bookies in Vijayawada. This is reflected in State Crime Record Bureauâ€™s statistics at various police units. 

 Nellore police booked around 21 FIRs branching out in the sensational arrest of Krishna Singh last year. Overall, the number of cases under the AP Gaming Act in Nellore saw a 470 per cent increase in 2017 compared to 2016.   betting has been a major menace across Andhra Pradesh for the past several years. 
 
 The police units in other districts like Guntur Urban, Guntur Rural, Kadapa and Vizag too played a pivotal role by focusing on enforcement against it. While officials claim that organised betting, which is conducted physically, saw a substantial decrease during this IPL season, there is a rise in the rackets running cricket betting online.
 
 Android applications are being used to run cricket betting and cops struggle to trace them due to technological disadvantages.
