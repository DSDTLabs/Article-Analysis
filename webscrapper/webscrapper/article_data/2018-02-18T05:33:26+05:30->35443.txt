Kolkata: A day after the accident at   and   crossing that injured a 55-yearold woman   and her 10-year-old grandson Pulakesh Naiya, Kolkata Traffic Police said it’s focussing on micro-management across the city to reduce accidents at these “black spots”.

 While changing road furniture and installing escalators on foot overbridges are at the top of the agenda, they are also planning to ask IIT-Kharagpur experts for long-term solutions at crossings lik e Chingrighata on EM Bypass.
 
  
  
 “First, we are changing the road design at the accident spot — where Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has promised all help — to stop rampant accidents. Median dividers up to 25 metres on Deshpran Sashmal Road — from   rail bridge towards Tollygunge Phanri — will now be completely blocked. The temporary structures have been installed by us on Friday itself, and we have written to the   to put up the permanent structures. The attempt was made by us even earlier. We are now happy to receive the required support,” said Sumit Kumar, DC (traffic).
 
 The police said that they have also written to the civic body to plug the gaps between the lamp posts and median dividers so that no one can cross the DPS Road using those gaps.
 
 On Friday, Ghosal and her school-bound grandson Naiya had a miraculous escape when they were hit by a 40B private bus near Charu Market and fell between its wheels as it passed over them.
 
 A Lalbazar source said: “We have also identified four overbridges that need escalators. It’s not based only on the huge movement at these intersections but also the height of these overbridges that makes it difficult for both the youths and elderly commuters to climb them. We have asked for escalators for overbridges at Dhakuria crossing, the NRS Hospital, Rajabazar-Sealdah and Ultadanga.”
