LUCKNOW: Describing Prime Minister   as a confused man, Samajwadi Party chief   on Sunday challenged him for an open debate on the achievements of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre and work done by his government in the state. He said the BJP leadership was misleading people by making unfounded allegations of religious discrimination in rolling out welfare schemes, power supply and free laptop distribution.

 Dealing at length with allegations of religious and caste discrimination in welfare schemes, Akhilesh read out a list – which had names of meritorious students from all castes—who were given scholarships and laptops -- and challenged the opposition parties to go through the list and find out if there was any discrimination.
 
 Questioning the BJP’s manifesto promise of loan-waver for small and marginalised farmers in UP, he said no such scheme had been rolled out in any of the BJP-ruled states including Maharashtra which has been reeling under agrarian crisis or Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh where condition of farmers was bad. “Why is Modi waiting for the results of UP elections to extend the loan-waiver. He is the PM and can do it right away,” said Akhilesh, addressing his first press conference at the party office after becoming the SP national president.
 
 “Desh ke kisan soch rahe hain UP ke bahane unka karz maaf hojaye. Kahin UP ke kisan se vote lene ke liye aapne inse ye baat to nahi ki (Farmers across India are hoping that their loans will be waived as well…Are promises being made to UP farmers only to get their votes?),” he said. “I am ready for a debate with the PM on the issue of development …. We can hold the debate on the banks of river Ganga which was yet to be cleaned as promised, or at the village of Khazanchi, the baby boy born while his mother was standing in a queue outside a bank post demonetisation,” he said.
