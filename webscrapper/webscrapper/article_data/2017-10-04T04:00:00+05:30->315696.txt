Surat: The eagerly awaited festival of Chandni Padva will be celebrated by Surtis on October 6, the last full moon day in the Hindu calendar. 

 Nothing unusual with this except that people have a local variety of sweet known as ghari and also bhushu (namkin) on the day. As much as 1,00,000kg ghari made with mawa and dry fruits will be consumed by people along with bhusu. 
 
 However, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials are concerned because there is possibility of adulteration of mawa being brought to the city by sweetmeat shop owners from places in north Gujarat, Saurashtra and Madhya Pradesh. At least 35 tonne mawa will arrive in the city for ghari preparation from outside Surat and about 50% of it will be adulterated, SMC officials said. SMC food inspectors have so far collected 44 samples of mawa and ghari from sweetmeat shops and sent them for test. 
 
 “We have collected samples of kachcha mawa that was brought from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra and north Gujarat. These samples have been sent for analysis at government laboratories in Rajkot and Bhuj,” a food inspector said. “There is possibility that ghari consumed by people could be made of stale mawa or even adulterated. Mawa produced by local milk cooperative is not only pure but fresh too,” he added. 
 
 “Sample collection is part of our campaign. We want to ensure that people get to consume pure ghari,” SMC chief medical officer Dr Aashish Naik said.
