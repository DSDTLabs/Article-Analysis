BENGALURU: A man who attempted to prevent a fight between two customers and staffers of an eatery on   was himself at the receiving end on Tuesday. The enraged customers allegedly hit him with kebab skewers. 

 A video that captured the attack on the man,  , began doing the rounds on social media on Friday, with 33 people having shared it on Facebook by the evening.
 
 In the social media post along with the video, Kar said he tried to stop two men from attacking staffers at a fast-food chain, when the former hit him with skewers. Kar was was out for dinner with friends when he saw the men screaming at the outlet employees, complaining about the quality of the chicken rolls. While Kar agreed that the roll smelled foul, he wrote in the post that that men were drunk and “behaved violently.”
 
 “Within no time the matter escalated...They barged into the store and started slapping the counter boys. They were throwing almost everything they could find inside the store,” the post read.
 
 Unsettled, Kar intervened and suggested the customers take up the issue with the management and spare the staff. This, however, turned their attention towards him. “One of them picked up the hot skewers from the grill and started hitting me. I managed to get away after receiving two or three blows. They even hit me across the face, missing my right eye by a milimetre. I have injuries on my back, hip, shoulder and face,” he wrote, adding one his expat friends was also injured.
 
 While the entire episode was captured by   at the outlet and on the mobile phone of a passerby — Kar posted the same video online — neither the restaurant nor Kar lodged a police complaint. “I will lodge a complaint if the outlet files it along with me,” he told TOI.
