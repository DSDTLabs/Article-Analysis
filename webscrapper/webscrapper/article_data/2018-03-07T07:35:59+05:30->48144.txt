PUNE: A four-member committee of senior education officers — formed to look into the incident of alleged strip-searching of students appearing for HSC exams at the   Vishwashanti Gurukul school — submitted its report to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education on Tuesday.

 “The committee noted that the girls refused to meet the members. Some said they would want their parents to be present. However, despite the committee allowing that, the girls refused to meet the squad. The members then tried talking to other female students. While some refused to talk, others said they had not been strip-searched. Now, the board will take a decision,” said  , secretary, Pune division.
 
 On March 3, some girl students had complained of being strip-searched by women staffers of MIT to prevent cheating. A complaint was lodged at the   police station. However, MIT officials say the allegations are an attempt to malign the institution as the parents were upset with MIT’s stance against cheating. The 17-year-old complainant could not be reached for comment.
