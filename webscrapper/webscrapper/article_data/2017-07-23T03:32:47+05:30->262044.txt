KOLKATA: A day after chief minister   urged her followers to start a ‘BJP Quit India’ stir from August 9 to firm up the political battlelines, Union HRD minister   dubbed it a “daydream” by a “non-existent unity (of 18 opposition political parties)”.

 “Her campaign to dislodge Modiji... Everybody can daydream but that is not going to happen. A non-existent unity can’t give us a challenge. (Narendra) Modi is connected to the poor, all sections of society. We are getting stronger by the day,”   said on the sidelines of an event in Kolkata on Saturday.
 
 “It is a worrisome feature of her politics, especially in the last few months. She is dividing society, dividing communities. In democracy, communal harmony is the essence and that is getting disturbed,” he added.
 
 Trinamool Congress reacted sharply. Parlimentary affairs minister Partha   told reporters: “Nothing can be more ridiculous than calling Mamata Banerjee communal. When the minorities were attacked (in the aftermath of the   demolition), she was the one who was out on the streets with Mother Teresa. Not only in Bengal, in Indian politics, she is one of the most prominent secular faces.”
 
 Accusing BJP of being dishonest, Chatterjee said: “It is BJP that is playing the communal card to divide Bengal. They are coming here, having meal on banana leaf and then making absurd comments. They neither have any connection with Bengal nor do any idea about the sentiments of the people here. They first need to tell the people how much black money has been recovered so far after demonetisation.
