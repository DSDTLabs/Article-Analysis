MUMBAI: A day after TOI reported about the  's shoddy road repair work in  , a senior citizen from the locality told TOI on Thursday about how the civic body takes its "own sweet time" to repair footpaths. 

  (61), who lives down  , said BMC is still to repair an uneven stretch of a footpath a year after Kumar had an accident at that spot. Th e base of a tree on the pavement was in a bad shape.
 
 "I fractured both my legs in April last year after I tripped and fell on an uneven footpath below my building on Henry Road, beside the Taj Mahal post office. The footpath had paver blocks," said Kumar. "Even today, not a bit of that pavement seems to have been repaired."
 
 The spot where she said she had fallen had rubble lying around. "Last year, work of laying a storm water drain pipe was on and the same continues. Despite all the sympathy that the local corporator and BMC officials showered on me, no one has taken action to improve the condition of the footpath." 
 
 Kumar said she had to cough up almost Rs 2 lakh for the medical treatment. "Worse still, I was left immobile for four months," said Kumar. "After that fall, I look down when I walk instead of looking ahead.
 
 Local corporator Sujata Sanap said the work on improving Henry road has already been scheduled. "I raised the issue at the standing committee meeting to ensure that the work gets priority," said Sanap.
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner of 'A' ward,  , said work on improvement of the stretch along Henry Road stretch has been sanctioned. "After the incident, we had immediately informed the roads department about repairs required there. Work will begin shortly," said Dighavkar.
