PUNE: The fire brigade on Monday night recovered the body of 40-year-old Kiran Abhay Hule of Karvenagar, a day after he fell into a nullah from a bridge on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass at  .

 Hule went missing while driving a two-wheeler towards his in-law’s house in Katraj to meet his wife and children. “It was Hule’s son’s birthday on Sunday,” said senior inspector Bajirao Mole of the Warje Malwadi police.
 
 Mole said when Hule did not reach Katraj on Sunday night, his wife lodged a missing person’s complaint. “After Hule’s motorcycle was found on the bridge, the fire brigade was summoned to carry out searches in the nullah,” he said.
 
 The fire brigade had to stop the search operation because the nullah was filled with garbage and silt. “When firemen found it difficult to trace the person on Monday morning, a heavy-duty machine was summoned from the Pune Municipal Corporation to clear the nullah,” Mole said.
 
 Mole said Hule’s body was traced after clearing the garbage. He said Hule worked as an autorickshaw driver.
 
 “He might have fallen into the nullah through the gap in the median of the bridge after his motorcycle rammed the cement railings,” Mole said.
