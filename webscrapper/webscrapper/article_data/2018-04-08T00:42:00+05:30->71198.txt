Coimbatore: Rural police on Friday arrested a 25-year-old man from Kaliyappagoundanur near Anaimalai for dishonouring and insulting the National Flag.

 He was identified as M Verti, a member of Tamil Nadu Dravidar Kazhagam, which was launched a few months ago. “He entered the Government Elementary School campus at Kaliyappagoundanur on Tuesday night and stomped on the National Flag there. He also uploaded the photograph of the act on his Facebook page. It went viral,” a police officer said.
 
 P Karunakaran, a member of Hindu Munnani from Anaimalai, had lodged a complaint with Anaimalai police against the man. Police registered a case against Verti under Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971 and arrested him on Friday evening.
 
 Verti told police that he was upset with the state and Union government for not taking steps to constitute the Cauvery management board. He also said that while the people of Thoothukudi were fighting against Sterlite Copper, the government did not do anything to find a solution.
 
 He was lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison. Further investigation is on.
