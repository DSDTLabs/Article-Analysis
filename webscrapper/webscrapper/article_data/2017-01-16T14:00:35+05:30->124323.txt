PATNA: The State Disaster Response Force ( ) personnel on Sunday claimed that instead of regular patrolling to check overloading of private boats, they were asked by the Patna district administration to ferry people from diara to Patna. Hence, they could not reach the accident spot on time to rescue people.

 What aggravated the situation was late arrival of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team. The   was allegedly informed by the state government almost two-and-a-half-hours after the boat capsize. Nine inflatable high-speed motorboats of SDRF with two men on each of them were deployed for river patrolling for the four-day kite festival organised by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation.
 
 “We started river patrolling on Saturday morning following a directive from our senior officer Ashok Kumar Yadav. We were also asked to keep an eye on private boats so that they don’t overload. However, the district administration asked us around 4pm to stop patrolling and start ferrying visitors from diara to Patna as sunset was approaching,” SDRF constable  , who was manning a high-speed boat with colleague Jeevan Kumar Sharma on Saturday, said.
 
 The other SDRF men, who were at the Gandhi Ghat on Sunday, said had they been allowed to continue river patrolling, more people would have been rescued as high-speed boats take very less time to cover distances in a calm river.
 
 SDRF commandant Vinod Kumar said teams of disaster response force were handed over to Patna district administration and it was up to the administration to use them judiciously.
 
 NDRF commandant Vijay Sinha said he received a call from disaster management department joint secretary Aniruddh Kumar around 8pm. “Four high speed boats stationed at Deedarganj were rushed to the spot immediately,” he claimed.
 
 Meanwhile, ADM (relief)   refuted claims that SDRF boats were used to ferry Makar Sankranti revellers. “I don’t have any such information,” Shekhar added.
