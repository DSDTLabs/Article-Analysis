 the stylish anchor of The   recently got to be part of   The humour festival in Chandigarh. He says, "It's an absolute honour to be a part of this. I was excited to be performing live at tagore theatre after 6 years. To perform in front of your home crowd is always a high.Just like millions of other people I am a big fan of Jaspal Bhatti . I grew up watching his shows. He truly was ahead of his times and an entertainer par excellence. Its unfortunate that I did not get to meet the legendary comedian. But I am grateful to God that in this lifetime I have this opportunity to perform at this festival and pay tribute to him". On being asked about his favourite comedian he says, "

 I am a big fan of  . His comic timing is impeccable. His performances have created many memorable characters".   India is doing exceptionally well and response to the same has been phenomenal. We have some amazing talent on the show and the energy on the set is very positive. I am glad people are loving a new quirky side of me. My brand of humour is different than what audience is used to see on TV. I guess that has worked in my favour. It's has been quite a fulfilling experience for me". He further adds, "I don't think so you can learn comedy. You can't develop a sense of humour or wit or comic timing. Its something you are born with. The rest is your understanding of life and how you observe things to make them a part of your act".
