RAJKOT: A Dalit man was set ablaze along with his car by four unidentified assailants near Ahir Samaj Wadi on Somnath Road in Veraval on Friday night. The attack was the result of a financial dispute, the police said.

 “The incident occurred at 9.30 pm on Friday when Bharat   (32) was returning home in his car. He was waylaid near Ahir Samaj Wadi by four attackers, who poured petrol on his car and set it ablaze. When Gohil jumped out of his vehicle to run for his life, one of the assailants threw a petrol bottle at him, which hit him on his back. When Gohil fell down, the assailant threw a burning matchstick on his back and set him ablaze,” an official from Veraval police said. 
 
 The passersby who reached the spot took Gohel to Veraval Civil Hospital from where he was shifted to Rajkot Civil Hospital. The case was first registered by officials of Rajkot Civil Hospital’s police chowky and then Veraval police officials were informed, who came and recorded Gohil’s statement. 
 
 In his statement, Gohil, who has been badly burned, said the attack was the result of a financial dispute. “Eight months ago I had purchased a car online from   of Ahmedabad at Rs 3.56 lakh. I had already paid him Rs 3 lakh, while I was to pay the remaining Rs 56,000 on May 5 this year. However, Parmar became desperate to recover the money and gave the recovery contract to Devayat   of Veraval. Jotava abused me over phone and threatened to set my car ablaze if I did not make the payment. I had recorded his call and filed an application of complaint with Patan police station. However, no action was taken in this connection.”
 
 Gohil alleged that the four assailants who had committed the crime claimed to be Jotava’s men. Meanwhile, Veraval police officials are in the process of registering the crime.
