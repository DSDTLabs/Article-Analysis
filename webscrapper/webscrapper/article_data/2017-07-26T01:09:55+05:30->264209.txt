NOIDA: Following 1,126   (TB) deaths in GB Nagar from January-April 2017 and 4,236 in 2016, the district administration will soon begin an active case-finding (ACF) programme to detect patients suffering from the disease in the ‘high-burden’ areas (where occurrence is more) in Noida and Greater Noida.

 Under the country-wide programme organised as part of the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), doctors and officials of the health department will take rounds of these areas to detect patients with symptoms of TB and give them free treatment upon confirmation.
 
 Scheduled from August 4-18, the programme will be inaugurated by state health minister Siddharth Nath Singh on August 4. According to the health department, the high-burden areas of GB Nagar include sectors 8, 9 and 10 in Noida, Nai Abadi and Gautam Puri areas in Dadri.
 
 “Most of the areas which are too populated, overcrowded and dirty are the ones which are likely to have more people infected with the disease. Crowded places having unsanitary conditions and poor ventilation are also likely to have such patients,” assistant chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Shireesh Jain, who is the nodal officer for the programme told TOI.
