Mumbai: The   (RBI) on Wednesday told the Gujarat high court that Essar Steel’s bad loans had increased in the last one year and the financial position being presented by the steelmaker was inaccurate. The   counsel also said that   had been given adequate notice period before the insolvency proceedings were initiated.

 The RBI was defending its decision to direct lenders to act against 12 defaulters, including Essar Steel, in the   and initiate insolvency proceedings. After hearing both sides, the court adjourned the matter till Thursday. The RBI rejected Essar’s contention that the steelmaker was being targeted, and said that the company would have an option to present a proposal under the insolvency proceedings.
 
 Earlier in the day, the Essar counsel asked the court to set aside the central bank’s directive to banks as it had already put forward a restructuring proposal to lenders. 
 
 Essar’s contention was that the RBI’s directive failed to take into account the operational performance of the steel company and of the restructuring process that was already initiated.
 
 The RBI counsel, however, argued that the Essar Steel restructuring proposal was at a premature stage and a long way from being complete. The central bank pointed out that Essar had loans in excess of Rs 45,000 crore, of which Rs 31,671 crore were   ( ) as on March 31, 2016. This has risen to Rs 32,864 crore as on March 31 this year.
