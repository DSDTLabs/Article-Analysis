DUBAI:  , the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships, talked up the importance of embracing smaller tour stops. The Spaniard, striking good looks and statuesque frame, said it was these events, sometimes tricky, often testing, that lent to a solid season, resulting in a longer stint at the top of the game.

 
 Muguruza, among five players who held the   No.1 ranking in 2017, said, staying at the top was the hardest thing to do in tennis.
 
 “When you're younger, you're dreaming about winning Grand Slams. You don't feel that excited when it's not Wimbledon. It's normal. Every player has that,” Muguruza, who was No.1 for four weeks last year, explained. “Once you are in a Grand Slam, you're like, okay this is history. I have learned with the years that all the WTA events are important. It is key also to be in the top spots, because you need to perform constantly good, constantly moving forward. Only with magic it's tough to be in this No.1 spot.”
 
 Muguruza said the pressure on the top players was so great because the margins were small at the elite level. “Before there were a few girls who were really dominating, especially Serena (Williams), the other ones never really get the chance to win the big titles. Now, I feel, here in Dubai, any girl in the draw can win it. This is something that is changing, all the girls realize they can also win a Grand Slam.”
 
 Angelique Kerber’s run in 2016, when she made three Slam finals, winning two and clinching the No.1 ranking, turned on a switch of sorts for players, showing the locker room anything was possible. “Serena was dominating for a lot of time, suddenly Kerber came and cut that. She made an incredible year,” Muguruza said.
