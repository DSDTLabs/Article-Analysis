THANE: The third day of the ongoing   was a hit as it attracted over 30,000 people not only from the city, but also from neighbouring cities. The morning chill broke as warm melodies filled the air. Current rockstar of Marathi classical music, Mahesh Kale’s concert at 6:30am had a packed house at the floating Tarang stage created inside Upvan Lake. His Katyar songs were lapped up by the swaying audience and so were other classics on the wintery dawn. 

 Tarang stage had eminent folk artist Ritu Verma from Chhatisgarh who performed Pandavani folk, followed by a scintillating rendition of percussion by Pt. Kalinath Mishra. Renowned Kheta Khan had his date with Thaneities with Rajasthani folk numbers that the audience left enthralled. The major attraction of the night was   who rocked the stage with their foot-tapping, pulse beating performance. “We were fascinated to see such a huge crowd. The show remained a hit,” said Purvesh Sarnaik, a member of the organizing committee.
