LUCKNOW: The poll process for the first phase in Uttar Pradesh began on Tuesday and Mathura saw just one candidate filing his nomination papers. For the people there, it was no surprise when the candidate was seventy two-year-old  , a familiar face in the arena by now. 

 Fakkad Baba may not have won a single election since he started contesting in 1976 and this year would be his 16th. Yet he plans to keep at it because of his guru’s prophecy of victory in his 20th election. 
 
 Baba, who sings bhajans and recites Ramayana for a living, is class 7th pass and lives in   in Mathura’s Govindnagar area. His affidavit says he’s a bachelor and has about Rs 30,000 to his name.
 
 Mahendra Singh, a Lucknow-based follower of Baba, says, “He has no qualms about his successive defeats as he has faith in his guru’s prophecy.” 
 
 For the past 40 years, Baba has been reciting Ram Charit Manas in Mathura households and expects the residents to help him win. “I am confident that I will emerge victorious in my 20th election,” Baba said.
 
 As far as election issues are concerned, Fakkad Baba would focus on how education has been commercialized. “I also want to stress on Hindi as a medium of education as that would benefit a larger number of youth,” he said. Apart from that, he would work on innovative ways to create jobs for youngsters.
 
 “Providing drinkable water to residents of Mathura is a major challenge where virtually all the political parties have failed miserably. That would be top priority,” he said.
