AHMEDABAD: If everything goes according to plan, from this academic year   may give admissions to 4,000 students in undergraduate medical course. The state is likely to see an increase of 370  , including a new medical college in Palanpur.

 Sources said that under the greenfield policy of the central government, Banas Dairy had applied for a medical college in Palanpur and another private party for a medical college in Dahod. According to reports, the Centre is likely to approve a 150-seat medical college in Palanpur while the same for Dahod has been rejected.
 
  
  The officials said that apart from the Palanpur college, the   (MCI) has also approved 70 more seats in Vadodara medical college. With this increase, Vadodara medical college will now have the capacity to admit 250 students; earlier it was 180.
 
 The MCI has also asked for a compliance report from Jamnagar and Surat medical colleges. Both the colleges have sought permission to admit 250 students. Currently, they have 200 and 250 seats respectively.
 
 Officials said that in both the colleges, the MCI had sent its individual report pointing out deficiencies. However, once these colleges send their compliance report, the MCI will once again conduct an inspection. The officials said that they are expecting 50 more seats in Jamnagar college and 100 more for Surat college from this academic year.
 
 Taken together, around 370 more seats are likely to be available from this   (150 seats in Palanpur college; 70 seats in Vadodara; 100 in Surat; and 50 in Jamnagar). Against this increase, the MCI and central government have decided that the intake in the Pramukhswami Medical College, Karamsad, be decreased from 150 seats to 100 seats in the   course for 2017-18.
 
 The order issued by the central government states that the Centre had withdrawn permission granted (vide order dated August 18) to Pramukhswami Medical College for admission of a second batch of 150 for the MBBS course of the academic session 2017-18. The college can take admission against only 100 seats.
 
 In all, there are 3,680   in 24 medical colleges. With an effective increase of 320 seats, the number of medical seats available for admission in Gujarat may touch 4000.
