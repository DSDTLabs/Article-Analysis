KOLKATA: Three doctors , two senior and a junior, were felicitated at the 25th anniversary celebrations of Peerless Hospital on Tuesday. 

 One of the oldest corporate hospitals in the city, Peerless marked its silver jubilee by honouring paediatric surgeon Subir Chattejee and Shital Bandopadhyay, who have served in a Burdwan village for several decades. Apart from them, this year's state   topper Shamin Ara was also awarded.
 
 While Chatterjee received a 'Hall of Fame' award for his contributions, Bandopadhyay was given the 'Rural Healthcare' award. "The idea was to recognize the efforts of doctors, who have worked tirelessly for decades. While doctors' contributions are often highlighted, few know about the meritorious MBBS students," said Sudipta Mitra, chief executive officer of Peerless Hospital. Hospital MD Sujit Kar Purakayastha was also present.
