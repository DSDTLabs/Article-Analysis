NAGPUR: After UGC’s clarification on PhD row, the   (NU) has realized that it wasn’t offering part-time doctoral degrees. Now, NU would be coming up with norms governing   by June.

 “The   clarification is for regular and part-time degrees. Many universities run part-time degree courses, but NU never had any such course till date. Now, we will frame new norms governing part-time degrees where the students, who’re doing jobs, could pursue degree without taking any break from their job,” pro-VC Pramod Yeole told TOI.
 
 The entire confusion was created after NU came up with a new condition asking the in-service aspirants to present a letter from employer regarding three years leave granted for pursuing PhD, as per UGC norms.
 
 Yeole clarified that those doing jobs were not directly benefited by the UGC’s clarification as it was regarding part-time degrees, which were not offered by NU. “Now, we would do something to provide respite to existing candidates by considering them as special case.”
 
 In its March 17 letter, the UGC clarified that PhDs which are pursued either full-time or part-time will be treated as degrees awarded through regular mode, provided those are in conformity with the existing statutes/bylaws/ordinances, of the parent university. It, however, mentioned that the PhD acquired under distance mode is not permitted.
