Life is like a fairy tale for newly-weds couple   and  . “I still don’t feel the difference. Chotobelar putul khelar moton lage ekhon jibon ta. But I must admit that   is a brilliant husband. Not only does he take responsibility of the house, he also takes care of me,” said   with a smile. So how do they divide household chores? “Setting the bed is my husband’s duty! I have acrylic nails and I don’t want to risk breaking them! Even after years of courtship, we chat for a hour and then go to sleep. It’s just that Gaurav’s name in my WhatsApp chat bar has fallen way below as he mostly by my side.” Gaurav on his part said, “The only thing that has changed is that I don’t have to wish her good morning through messages anymore for I can see her when I wake up.”
