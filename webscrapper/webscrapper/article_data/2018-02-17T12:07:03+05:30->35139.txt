PALAKKAD: The state failed to get a bigger share of water from the   river basin as it did not prepare project plans to develop river basins and failed to fight the case in the   properly, said Chittur MLA K Krishnankutty. He said Kerala had demanded 90tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) share of water from Cauvery basin against the 30tmcft water awarded by the Cauvery Water Tribunal. 

  But the apex court in its judgment on Friday did not consider Kerala's demand for more water.
 
  He said till now Kerala have not utilized even a single drop of water from the 30tmcft water awarded by the tribunal earlier. The Karapuzha-Kuttiyadi project in  , which has to utilize 5tmcft of Cauvery water has been using it at a slow pace. The tribunal had awarded Kerala only 30tmcft water though the state contributed 147 tmcft water to the Cauvery through its three tributaries, the Kabini, Bhavani and Pambar, originating in Kerala.
 
  When Kerala tried to utilize 5tmcft water through the   and the Mukkali diversion in  , the Tamil Nadu government opposed the projects and now the matter is under litigation. The Kabani and the Bhavani were part of Malabar in the erstwhile Madras presidency. The British government had neglected the potential of their river basins. The Pambar basin in the princely state of Travancore also had the same fate. In the 1970s, the government took up the augmentation of power generation at the Kuttiyadi power project by diverting water from the Panamaram, one of the tributaries of the Kabini. The Karappuzha irrigation project was taken up but not yet completed, Krishnankutty said.
 
  The Attappadi irrigation project and the Mukkali diversion project also drew environmental objections, he said. But Tamil Nadu's annual plan for 2016-17 shows that it had taken up projects costing Rs 14,500 crore in Cauvery basin to utilize the share of Kerala's share.
