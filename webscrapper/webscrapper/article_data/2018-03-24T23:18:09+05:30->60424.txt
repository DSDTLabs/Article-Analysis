Ahmedabad: The city, always experiencing arid climate historically, excelled at subterranean architecture such as stepwells to get some respite from scorching heat. These structures, used for water storage, also doubled up as resting place. Bhammariyo Kuwo at Mehmdabad, commissioned by Mahmud Begada, is one such example.

 City-based experts have recently discovered a subterranean structure – at least three stories below the ground – at the compound of erstwhile Calico Mill near Jamalpur. The structure is not listed with any of the major agencies of the city or state probably as it was located within the mill premises on a private land.
 
 The structure, now prone to encroachment, has been reduced to a dump yard by the local population as the central shaft, probably housing a well, is covered with garbage.
 
 Prof Ramji Savaliya, director of BJ Institute of Learning and Research, said that on the basis of the photographs of the structure, it is likely that the wider brick and lime mortar structure belongs to late Sultanate or early Mughal period.
 
 “Historically, the location where the structure is located was used as a camp area by the armies outside the city walls. As Sabarmati River is in the vicinity, it can be considered that the subterranean structure might have been constructed as a resting place. However, more examination at the location is required along with cleaning of the structure,” said Savaliya.
 
 Experts also pointed at the similar structures in design at Bhudar Mistry no Aaro near Jamalpur and Asif Khan Tomb near Sarkhej. Some of the structures right on the banks of Sabarmati also employed similar style of columns and arches.
 
 The land on which the structure is located is part of the ongoing liquidation process of Calico Mill.
