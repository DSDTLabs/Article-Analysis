Actress   says staying active has helped her have a 'great' pregnancy. 

 The 33-year-old 'Total Divas' star is expecting her first child with her husband   this spring, and has said her active lifestyle - which sees her enjoy   such as hiking - has helped her feel good.
 
 "I've really gotten into hiking. I think being in   I'm lucky to have the desert and all the mountains. I was heavily active into Barre and I kept going, but in my first trimester, I all of a sudden was in Barre class and I'm like, 'I don't think I can keep up.' 
 
 ''You have to be really careful, which I want to be. I don't want to like body slam anyone through tables. But it's nice to stay active. It makes me feel so good and I feel like that's why I've had such a great pregnancy," she says.
