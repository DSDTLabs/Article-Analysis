VIJAYAWADA:   Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) initiative of She Autos meant to empower women is turning out to be a big failure in the city. 

 The blue-coloured She Autos moving in the city which should have been driven by women are seen with men in driving seat in the absence of proper monitoring from city police and VMC. 
 
 After the success of She Cabs in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh government took the initiative to empower women and CM Naidu flagged off the first phase of She Autos in December 2015 in Vijayawada. VMC had selected beneficiaries for the scheme conducting special classes and providing financial support from a few nationalised banks. 
 
 But it has been observed that close relatives and family members of   owners are driving these them. M. Ravi Krishna an auto driver driving She Auto in   said, “This auto belongs to my sister and she drives for one shift and hires me for the second shift. We both are earning Rs 1500 every day and we hope the government considers our problem.
 
 Auto Workers unions are alleging that discrepancies in selecting beneficiaries are the main reason for the failure of She Autos in the city.
 
  “Majority of She Auto owners in the city are TDP activists and they were given autos without proper training. She Autos have become a tool for auto hiring agencies and the city police should take stringent action,” K. Venkateswara Rao a member (Centre of Indian Trade Unions) CITU said. 
 
 Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ramprasad Rao said that the issue was in their notice and lack of proper training for lady drivers is the reason for this. 
 
 “Traffic in the city has increased and I met with accident twice so I have decided to hire a male driver for my auto to repay loan amount,” says a beneficiary on condition of anonymity. She said that it is crime to hire She Auto to a male driver but was doing it to support her family.
