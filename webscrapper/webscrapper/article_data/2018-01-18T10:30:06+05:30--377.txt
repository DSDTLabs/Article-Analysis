PANAJI: Minister for urban development Francis D’Souza said he would not be surprised if the state assembly elections were held in 2019 alongwith the   elections. 

 The Mapusa MLA said that vice-president   had already indicated the Union government’s inclination towards simultaneous elections and with a coalition government functioning in Goa, the likelihood of Goa going into early polls could not be ruled out.
 
 “Early elections is a possibility. It cannot be ruled out,” D’Souza said. “But there is no guarantee that it will happen. Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu said that it is better for Goa to go for elections in 2019. I feel it could be a hint.”
 
 When asked by reporters about why he felt that Goa could see fresh assembly elections in 2019, D’Souza said that “Coalition governments are difficult to run. There are too many pulls and pressures and one solution could be to get out of the coalition mess.”
 
 However, the former deputy chief minister said that chief minister   remained in control of the government. “But there are things that happen behind the curtains and I don’t know what happens behind the scenes. I wouldn’t say that there are too many pressures, but when you have a coalition you have to make adjustments,” D’Souza said.
 
 Transport minister Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, did not share the D’Souza’s views on early elections.
 
 “At this stage, early elections are not required. People have given us the mandate to run this government for five years,” said Dhavalikar.
 
 “The decision to form a coalition government was done by Manohar Parrikar, Vijai Sardesai and   along with BJP leaders and me. If anything, it’ll be decided by the BJP leaders, otherwise this government will run its full term,” he added.
 
 He further added that the development that Goa is seeing currently in terms of infrastructure and water supply was not there during the Congress regime.
