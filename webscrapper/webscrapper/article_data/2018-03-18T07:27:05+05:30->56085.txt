MALDA/KOLKATA: In a rerun of 2017, the   has ordered an inquiry into an allegation of the   physical science question paper being leaked on WhatsApp on Saturday. The leak allegedly happened out of an examination centre at Malda’s   High School. However, board president Kalyanmoy Ganguly said the picture on WhatsApp was from the 2016 Madhyamik exam, adding that the   has been asked to conduct an inquiry to identify who had intentionally started the rumour.

  
 The screenshot which went viral was first reported by the centre secretary of Enayetpur to the district convener at 1:22pm. However, a WhatsApp image circulating among journalists shows that it was sent at 11.49am, eleven minutes before the examination started. The image, however, had no similarity with Saturday’s question paper.
 
 Another set of pictures which emerged on WhatsApp later shows it to be from 2018’s physical science examination. “But there is no reason to believe that they were sent out before the exam got over at 3pm since those pictures do not have a time stamp,” said a teacher.
 
 Board sources suspect it was a ‘disruptive move’. “Students are not allowed to carry cellphones to examination halls. The question papers are in the custody of four persons who carry cellphones. I wonder how the WhatsApp message was sent out under such tight security. It appears that somebody from within is trying to disrupt the examination process,” a board official added.
 
 This year WBBSE has taken additional measures to enhance security. Now, opening the seal on a set of question papers triggers an alarm through a GPS tracker.
 
 The board administrator also got in touch with education minister  . “The minister asked me to order a probe and fix responsibilities as early as possible,” he said.
 
 Trinamool teachers’ cell leader Sanjoy Bal, who is also the convenor of this year’s Madhyamik exam, however, said: “There was no such incident. The examination was held peacefully.”
