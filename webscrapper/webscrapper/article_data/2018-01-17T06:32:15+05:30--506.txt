CHENNAI: Digital signboards displaying arrival, departure and other details of MTC buses may soon make commuting a bit easier. 

 The passenger information systems proposed by Chennai Smart City Limited (CSCL) will be initially for 10 depots —  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and Anna Nagar (West), which are some of the busiest depots in the city. The information boards will be integrated with the corporation’s proposed ‘command and control centre’ project.
 
 “Now there is a lack of accurate information regarding arrival time of buses, route numbers and destination. Information desks at depots are short-staffed or absent. This leads to confusion among commuters,” said a CSCL official. “The digital signboards will display all the information that a commuter needs.”
 
 With more MTC buses getting GPS devices, information about arrival and departure timings would get more accurate, the official said. 
 
 While the depots chosen for installation are tentative, the project is likely to be expanded to all depots, covering the entire MTC operations in the city and its extended areas. The cost estimate is being worked out as the detailed project report is being prepared.
