 Dhillon, who is an alumnus of Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, said: â€œI am an immigrant and a businessman and I'm extremely thankful for the opportunities I've had growing up here in Canada.
 
 "I was very fortunate that the importance of education was drilled into me by my family, my parents, my brother, really everybody around me growing up."
 
 The Sikh real estate tycoon, who also holds an MBA from the famous Ivey School of Business at Western University, added: "Education is what drives successful global nations and Canada is unique in that there is so much opportunity here.
 
 "The UofL is a world-class university that the world needs to discover."
 
 University President and Vice Chancellor Mike Mahon said the donation from Dhillon will be transformational for his institution.
 
 "Our university was founded by forward-thinking mavericks...Here we are 50-plus years later and we're still looking ahead, pushing boundaries and creating an educational experience like no other.
 
 "This gift, this commitment from Dhillon, will help drive us forward."
