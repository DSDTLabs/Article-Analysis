KOLKATA: A theft at Entally MLA Swarnakamal Saha’s Janbazar residence at a time when both he and his councillor son Sandipan were present at home has left the Kolkata police in a spot. The theft has led the Sahas to “review” their security situation and take appropriate measures.

 The incident took place early on Friday. The thief climbed up the front grille to reach the second floor of the house from where he made away with a laptop and a camera. The accused was inside for more than one and a half hours till Sandipan heard a noise and raised an alarm.
 
 Cops have got a clear CCTV footage that shows the thief climbing up to the second floor, where Sandipan stays. Soon after the theft, senior officers from Lalbazaar, including DC (central)  , visited the house.
 
 Two teams from the antiburglary squad have already been formed to probe the theft. The New Market police, which had registered a case, have formed two more teams. “Since it seems the thief was familiar with the area, the needle of suspicion points to locals. A few people are being questioned,” said the police.
 
 Cops have already begun raids across Entally, Taltala, Maidan and   police station areas. Sources said a local criminal — probably a drug addict — might be behind the theft. “We do have some leads,” said a senior cop at  .
 
 According to the family members, the thief had come alone and climbed up to the second floor. “He climbed the grille between 1.30am and 1.50am. The thief was trying to enter Sandipan’s room around 3am, but a sound woke him up. Sandipan then asked his father to switch on the lights. By the time the alarm could be raised, the thief had fled,” said a family member.
 
 “We are politicians and people keep visiting our house well past midnight. We have never faced such an incident before. We will be more careful,” said Swarnakamal.
