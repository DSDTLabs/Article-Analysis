  A member of   band, Sen was in Delhi to perform. He admitted to being proud of calling Delhi his hometown.
 
  Born in Lucknow and raised in Delhi, Sen said, "Delhi is absolutely rocking all the time. It's my home, it's my identity and you saw the crowd".
 
  "Strange story, I was brought up in Jammu and Kashmir actually, and I shifted to Delhi when I was in school. The difference is that Delhi was less crowded then. Otherwise, Delhi ka Dil abhi bhi waise hi dhadakta hai jaise pehle dhadakta tha (the heart of Delhi still beats with the same kind of energy like it used to)", he added.
 
  He noted, "Each time amidst the rap of   and songs of  , there was something about the  ,  ,   that always brought back the best of memories. The songs of Euphoria endured with the test of time and they found a cult following in every new generation".

  He described 'A Cappella' as the purest form of music.
 
  He concluded, "I think because of films in   all the channels have been bought, slots have been bought so younger artist doesn't really have the opportunity to showcase his/her talent. The only way to do it is actually social media, the only problem being, a lot of people misuse social media that is something that has to be thought about. It's important that we use it in a positive way".
