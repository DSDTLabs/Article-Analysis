MUMBAI: After offering big sops to Mumbai voters,   president   on Sunday announced a similar clutch of schemes for Thane, including blanket exemption from property tax to houses measuring up to 500 sqft. A state-of-the-art sports complex, a sprawling central park and a new water dam are the other schemes the Sena announced to woo   ahead of the civic polls. 

 Ulhasnagar, too, will get similar benefits if the Sena wins the municipal corporation election, Thackeray said at a press conference at Matoshree, his Bandra residence, on Sunday.
 
 Senaâ€™s   are aimed at pre-empting BJP's bid to promise more reforms and infrastructure improvements in Thane, one of the largest municipal bodies in the state, where seat-sharing talks between the two parties are locked in a stalemate. Both Sena and BJP units in Thane have been talking of going it alone in the lake city.
 
 In Thane and  , houses measuring up to 700 sqft will be given concessions in property tax, said the Sena, while those above 700 sqft will get concessions if residents implement citizen-friendly schemes such as sanitation and rainwater harvesting.
 
 In Thane, the civic body, if retained by the Sena in the February polls, will begin work on an ambitious central park. To be set up on a 30-acre plot, the park will have a lake, sports and tree zones, a theme garden and an amphitheatre. Senior Sena minister and the party's pointperson in Thane Eknath Shinde gave details of the scheme.
 
 A state-of-the-art sports complex will come up near Ghodbunder Road under the aegis of the Thane civic body, Shinde said. The TMC has plans to start water transport to cope with traffic bottlenecks in the Thane-Dombivli-Ambarnath and the Mira Road-Bhayandar-Vasai stretch, he added.
 
 Turning his focus on Mumbai, Thackeray said if Sena retains control over BMC, students, in school uniforms, will be exempted from BEST bus fare on trips to school and back. It also plans to offer insurance cover to BEST staff, he said.
