MUMBAI: The city's   index (AQI) on Friday was at its cleanest so far this year at 55. An   lower than 100 is considered 'good' and pollution in the   poses little or no risk. The city's AQI began to improve since Thursday when it was 78. 

 
 
 
 
 Researchers at   (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) said they expect the air to remain clean for another three days. The AQI forecast for Saturday is 62.
 
 The AQI recorded by Safar has been attributed to high wind speeds. "When temperatures in northern parts are extremely high and there is a heat wave-like situation, high wind speed passage develops in coastal parts. Fast winds carry pollutants away from the city," said  , project director, Safar.
 
 On Friday, the AQI record was below 100 at 10 locations in the city. The least polluted was Andheri with an AQI of 27. tnn
