NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Friday asked the AAP government to inform it about progress in holding elections for the   by next week. 

 Justice Hima Kohli sought to know the status of preparation of   from the directorate of Gurudwara elections, Delhi government, on a petition filed by   president Paramjit Singh Sarna.
 
 Sarna had last year moved court saying he apprehended a delay in holding of the elections. He had sought directions to ensure the elections, scheduled in February, are held on time. HC had then sought to know the timeline from the directorate, which assured court that electoral rolls would be ready by December 31, 2016. 
 
 However, on Friday the directorate filed an application seeking extension of time and said it is preparing electoral rolls with photographs of voters and this would require more time. At the same time, the directorate maintained that it is duty bound to conduct elections and declare the results in February as mandated under the Act governing management of gurdwaras.
 
 Last year, the government had said that fresh electoral rolls could not be prepared on time due to paucity of staff. HC then disposed of the petition filed by SAD Delhi, but the organisation again approached the court seeking contempt proceedings citing instances of alleged delay.
