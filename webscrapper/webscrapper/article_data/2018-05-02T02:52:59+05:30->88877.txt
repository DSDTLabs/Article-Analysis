CHANDIGARH: The armed forces tribunal (AFT) pulled up the defence ministry (MoD) over its “complete lack of empathy” for its failure to pay war injury pension to an   officer, who was discharged from duty 40 years ago, after losing a leg and an eye while cleaning minefields on the China border in 1966. It also fined the ministry Rs 30,000 for making the officer go through unnecessary litigation. 

 
 Major   of  , in his mid-70s now, suffered the injuries on July 11, 1966 in an operational area in Sikkim. He was decorated with Sena Medal (gallantry) and his injury was declared a “battle casualty.” He continued to serve in the Army for 12 years after sustaining the injuries, but after further aggravation was invalidated on September 18, 1978 with 100% disability for life.
 
 On leaving the Army, the officer was denied war injury pension, but was granted disability pension by the MoD’s accounts department. The MoD had agreed to pay him war injury pension from July 2013 when he had approached the government for his dues for the first time. However, the officer wanted to be paid from September 1978, when he was invalidated from the services and had approached the AFT to get arrears of his war injury pension. 
 
 “The Centre has schemes for the welfare of veterans, but we note with regret and dismay that the authorities responsible for the implementation of government policies exhibit complete lack of empathy while extending benefits under such policies/rules etc. to deserving soldiers,” the AFT observed, while directing the MoD to pay him the arrears from 1978 with 9% interest. 
 
 The tribunal also imposed a cost of Rs 30,000 on the ministry for forcing the gallantry award winner into an unnecessary and unavoidable litigation. A division bench of judicial member, Justice M S   and administrative member, Lt Gen Munish Sibal of AFT Chandigarh passed these orders.
