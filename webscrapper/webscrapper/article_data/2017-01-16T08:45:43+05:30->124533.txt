MUMBAI:   police registered a murder case after a Thrissur  , who was on a business trip here, was found dead in mysterious circumstances. Police have sent the body for post-mortem and are awaiting its report. 

  Kerala jeweller, Raju M who was on a business trip since January 11, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in a hotel. The   room was found locked from outside.
 
 Police said hotel staff alerted them that Raju, who was staying at Kamla Lodge, was locked inside. After waiting for three days, when there was no response to calls on his mobile phone, the hotel management called up the police. Hotel staff opened his room with a set of duplicate keys only to find Raju hanging. 
 
 Police, after conducting a spot panchnama, moved the body to Rajawadi hospital. 
 
 “Besides hanging, Raju’s left   was found cut and had bled a lot. There is confusion over his death. If he had committed suicide, how come his room was locked from outside? Secondly, his cut wrist raised further suspicion,” said a police officer. Police said they found gold jewellery in his baggage. 
 
 Raju had gone to Delhi and Kolkata, and then came to Mumbai, police said.
