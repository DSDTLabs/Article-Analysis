VADODARA: The second consultative meeting for the land acquisition of the bullet train project witnessed some stormy scenes at the Sir   on Wednesday. 

 But unlike the meeting on April 9, which the officials had to wind up following complete chaos, the meeting on Wednesday continued amid presence of cops who remained stationed to ensure that things do not go out of control. Also, unlike the meeting on April 9 that saw presence of few project-affected persons and some farmer representatives, Wednesday’s meeting saw participation of 1,000 persons including residents from city areas. The officials too were present in full strength. 
 
 After the earlier meeting meet failure, it was for the first time that the officials could make a presentation prepared by the Delhi-based consultancy firm – the  , which detailed out the impact on the project in the district. 
 
 But when the presentation was mid-way, some individuals claiming to be farmer representatives, started disrupting and alleged that the officials had not held gram sabhas which was a pre-requisite before the second round of consultation. They even demanded that all the NHSRCL should be booked for spreading wrong information. But this time their attempt failed as another group of farmers demanded that they wanted to sit through the entire presentation.
 
 After the presentation, the officials had to face a series of questions related to the compensation packages, the jantri rates, the entitlement matrix designed for the project affected households, rehabilitation of those who will get displayed and alignment of the bullet train. 
 
 Some in the audience even demanded that jobs should be given to those families which will lose land due to the project.
 
 “This meeting was meant to share details of the project. While we will continue holding consultative meetings in other cities of the state, the joint measurement survey on the ground will also begin soon,” said  , chief project manager of NHSRCL.
