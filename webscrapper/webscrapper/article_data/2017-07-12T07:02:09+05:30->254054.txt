BENGALURU: Karnataka on Tuesday appealed to the Supreme Court to make fresh and   to the riparian states, saying the   award was based on the agreements made in 1892 and 1924.

 Noted jurist   submitted the appeal before the SC, appearing for Karnataka. A three-judge bench began the final hearing on the appeals filed by Karnataka,   and Kerala against the tribunal's 2007 final award on sharing of water.
 
 The court had rejected the Centre's objection that the tribunal award amounted to a final decree and it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals against the award. The tribunal's 2007 order awarded Tamil Nadu 419 tmcft of the total 740 tmcft water available in the  , and Karnataka 270 tmcft. According to advocate Brijesh Kalappa, Nariman argued the two agreements were an act of paramountcy (a legal principle that reconciles conflicting laws in a federal setup) as the British were ruling Madras state. Nariman said after the Constitution came into force and with Mysuru state being formed, the needs of riparian states should be taken into account and water should be freshly apportioned.
