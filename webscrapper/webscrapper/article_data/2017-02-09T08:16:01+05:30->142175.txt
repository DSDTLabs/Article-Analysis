BENGALURU: Eminent wildlife photographer   passed away at his Shantinagar residence on Tuesday night. He was 84. He is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.

  took to the camera in 1955 when photography was very nascent and experimented with macro photography much before the dawn of digital camera era. His knowledge of animal psychology was extraordinary and his black and white shots of the wildlife are evident for the same.
 
 Perumal’s son   said he started suffering breathlessness on Tuesday evening and gradually, heart rate dropped. “Though he suffered a stroke in June that had left him partially paralysed, he had almost recovered. He spoke to me two days ago as well,” he added.
 
 Perumal, known for his quiet and humble nature, is the recipient of more than 200 awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award for Wildlife Photography and the   award for Nature Photography. The book, ‘Reminiscences of a Wildlife Photographer’ contains most of his best photographs. He has also co-edited many books that go a long way in guiding amateur photographers. 
 
 He will be cremated at Wilson Garden crematorium on Thursday at 10.30am.
