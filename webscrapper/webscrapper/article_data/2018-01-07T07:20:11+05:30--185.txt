CHENNAI: A woman advocate has moved the Madras high court seeking direction to the government to provide due compensation to passengers who were forced to deboard from buses midway following the flash strike by workers of the state-owned transport corporations. 

 V   also wanted the court to direct the government to deduct the compensation from the salaries of the striking workers and take disciplinary action against them under service rules and initiate penal action for forcefully deporting passengers carrying valid tickets.
 
 As a temporary measure, the petitioner wanted the government to deploy drivers enrolled with the employment exchange. Though the demands of the protesting workers are reasonable, they cannot resort to such a flash strike causing great inconvenience to the public, she said. 
 
 The petition may be heard on Monday by the first bench headed by Chief Justice  .
