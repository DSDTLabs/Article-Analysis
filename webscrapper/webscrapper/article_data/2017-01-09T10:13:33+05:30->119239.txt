Nagpur: “The standard of Hindi has taken a hit as even most of the professors of the language cannot write it correctly. In such a situation we can hardly expect students to continue the rich legacy of the national language,” said  , an expert on Hindi.

 Speaking at a round table conference organized by Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan at its conference hall on Saturday, Saxena expressed his concern over decline in the standard of Hindi. A lot of money is spent on developing English language, but Hindi continued to be at the receiving end of the government, he remarked. “I am frustrated when I see the bad condition of Hindi and feel like filing a public interest litigation against institutions being run in the name of Hindi and funded by the government since these bodies are not up to the mark.” 
 
 Saxena also said that people’s dialect changes in various regions to the extend that it is very difficult to understand it. At times, people do not have the knowledge in which language they are speaking. So pathetic is the condition of the national language that in many regions people do not know Hindi, he said.
 
 Sexena said, “The problem is that even educated people do not understand its importance. In India, people who know English are considered to be of higher stature in society. Elders are proud of their kids studying English. The case gets even worse when you come to know that people flaunt around telling that their child studies and speaks English. There is a need to set some standards for Hindi universities if we want to save the national language,” he added.
