LUCKNOW: Hundreds of people, mostly local residents and those working abroad, protested outside   (RBI) on Thursday. They had gathered to exchange old currency notes but were turned down saying nothing can be done about them now. Police had to be called to control the situation.

 Many who came to change notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 said they had received messages on Whatsapp or Facebook stating that the last date to exchange demonetized currency was March 31. 
 
 Pushpendra Dubey of Telibagh said, “The official website said old notes can be changed till March 31. Why do we have to stand here protesting like this for our own money”.
 
 “The website does not mention any criteria for exchange,” said his friend.
 
 “The anxiety is palpable as holding of banned currency will become a crime after March 31,” said Tejpal Singh, who had been coming to the bank for three days. 
 
 “Every time we want to talk to an official, the guards tell us to go to Delhi or Mumbai, we don’t even have money to eat, how to go to Delhi,” said his wife.
 
 People continued arguing with the guards to get inside the bank. Two women who had old currency in more than Rs 1 lakh refused to leave until the notes were exchanged.
 
 “Every day there is a ruckus created by public. More than a thousand people turn up each day,” said Paramjeet Singh, a guard at RBI. 
 
 “Lakhs of queries and requests have flooded in from people who failed to deposit all their money by the December 30 deadline, seeking relief,” added another guard.
