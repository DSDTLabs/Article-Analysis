Eighteen years after he played a reluctant dad in 'Jab Pyaar Kisi Se Hota Hai',   is looking forward to play a parent again. The 51-year-old actor has given a go-ahead to Remo D'Souza's next, a dance-drama about the emotional journey of an ageing dancer and his lively 13-year old daughter who's on her own path to greatness.

  
  
 In a recent interview to a magazine, Salman had hinted at the gruelling prep that he will have to undertake for the yet-to-be-titled project which rolls in 2018. "In my next, I'm playing the father to a 13-year-old girl. It's a film about dancing. Like the Hollywood 'Step Up' franchise. I'm going to be a properly trained dancer. You know how painful that is? But I've always believed that effortless hard work should be seen on-screen," he was quoted as saying.
 
 While Salman shed 18 kg to play a wrestler in his last release, Sultan, he will have to get leaner for his dancer turn next year. "Salman listens to the choreographer, then, goes ahead and does his own steps, so it's going to be a lot of lessons for him this time," a source told Mirror.
 
 Remo had reportedly met Salman a year ago to discuss the script of the dance-drama but it was kept on hold since Salman had no dates at the time. The choreographer-filmmaker then dived into his superhero adventure, the Tiger Shroff starrer ' ', while Salman got busy with  's war-drama, ' '. Mid-2017, Sallu will kick off the   directed sequel, ' ' and after that it will be Remo's turn to wield the baton in 2018.
 
 The source informed that things finally fell into place last month, when the duo reunited. On December 27, Remo was also present at Sallu's birthday bash at his Panvel farmhouse.
 
 However, when Mirror contacted the choreographer-director, he remained tight lipped on the subject, only saying, "I cannot share anything at this point of time."
