Bengaluru: Since his   debut in 2013,   has always been a talent to watch out for. At the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Sunday, he showcased his batting craft during his 45-ball unbeaten 92. After a 74-minute show, he walked out to applause from spectators, teammates and the opposition.

 
 
 
 
 
 Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper  , heaping praise on the youngster, said: “He’s a talented player. He’s always done well in the IPL. He’s got a good, simple game. He’s strong at the crease and balanced too. He got off to a good start and kept his poise even when our bowlers bowled well. In the end, he was watching the ball and striking really well. He played a really good innings.”
 
 Samson’s teammate Shreyas Gopal, who was the hero with the ball for Rajasthan Royals, added: “He batted really well. We played a couple of practice games in Jaipur and he was hitting the ball really well.”
 
 On his own bowling, in which he collected the prized wickets of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, the Bengaluru legspinner said: “The wicket was a little slower than the normal Chinnaswamy wicket. The plan was to bowl a hard length and make it as difficult as possible for them. Getting the wickets of two of the biggest players in the world doesn’t happen every day. It’s a moment that I will always cherish.”
