CHARMINAR: Members of the   (CLMC) have demanded reopening of the   blast case and appealed to the   and state government to intervene. 

 Lateef Mohammed Khan, CLMC general secretary, alleged that investigating agencies have become tools for the Centre. He said political influence is used to weaken certain cases.
 
 "The Mecca Masjid verdict not only shocked Muslims, but also shook people's faith in the system. The Centre should not interfere in any probe carried out by central investigation agencies, but must ensure freedom of transparent task," said Khan late on Saturday.
 
 Youth, who were earlier picked up by police for their suspected role in the Masjid blast case, expressed dismay over the acquittal of Assemanand. "I was arrested by the police and was physically and mentally tortured by cops. But the confession of the Assemanand was a big relief and we were acquitted," Abdul Raheem, one of the victims, who was was behind bars for six months.
 
 "I want the Telangana government to challenge the judgment in upper court," said Abdul Raheem, another victim. A third victim Dr Ibrahim Ali Junaid explained how he was detained for 7-8 days. "The interrogators were forcing me to accept responsibility of the blast. When I denied, I was beaten up mercilessly. I ended up six months in jail and got a relief when Assemanand was caught. My request to the court is conduct retrial," said Junaid.
