HYDERABAD: A designated special court dealing with cases filed by   (ED) at Hyderabad issued summons to YSR Congress Party President Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, his auditor Vijay Sai Reddy, Indu Syam Prasad Reddy, businessman  , former minister Sabita Indra Reddy, Telangana Home Secretary B P Acharya and nine others in the   chargesheet filed by the enforcement directorate. It directed all the accused to be present in the court on March 16. 

 The crux of the CBI case filed in InduTechZone, which is now the basis for ED case, was that Indu Syam Prasad Reddy got a favour from the then AP chief minister   government in the form of 250 acres of prime land in Mamidipalli area of Ranga Reddy district for developing a technology zone.
 
  Syam Prasad Reddy who possesses no such expertise, simply mortgaged this land and raised huge loans and did not develop any tech zone there. A portion of this money was laundered into businessman Nimmagadda Prasad's companies and also certain firms belonging to Jagan. Syam Prasad Reddy, in lieu of the undue benefits he got, invested 70 crore in Jagan firms.
