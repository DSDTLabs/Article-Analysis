Throwing to the wind a blanket ban on registration of plots in the   marshland, an attempt has been made to register a portion of the marshland and obtain a   of Rs 1,350 crore.

 
 According to sources, the registration department received, a couple of months ago, a memorandum of deposit of title deeds to get a loan on a 20-acre property in Pallikaranai. “But upon verification of the documents, it was found that a portion of the land was under the survey number of Pallikaranai marshland, where one cannot  ,” said an official.
 
 While the approximate guideline value of the property was Rs 310 crore, the ‘land owner’ sought a loan of Rs 1,350 crore from a private bank.
 
 Sources aware of the developments said the registration department had thwarted the move despite pressure from various quarters to process the transaction.
 
 “Ironically, revenue department officials in the   taluk have issued patta to the portion of the marshland citing records in their computer database,” the official added.
 
 In view of encroachment of the 600-acre Pallikaranai marshland, the Madras high court in 2016 banned the registration of land in 25 survey numbers in two revenue villages of Sholinganallur and Perumbakkam in   district.
 
 A year later, the court initiated contempt proceedings against a registration department official over the issuance of registration of documents involving the marshland.
