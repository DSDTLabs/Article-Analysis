PUNE: Around 125 Ahmedabad-bound passengers reached their destination in the wee hours of Saturday instead of Friday night because of flight delay of almost seven hours.

 The scheduled departure time of the   flight (SG524) was 8.40pm on Friday. It finally took off at 3.25am and landed at the destination at 4.45am. Alleged wrong information from the airline’s officials frustrated the passengers further.
 
 P M Shah, a businessman of Ahmedabad, told TOI, “Initially, no   was available to provide any information. There were around 125 passengers, including women, children and senior citizens. All of them were absolutely clueless about the flight’s departure for some time.”
 
 He said, “Finally, an official came and said there would be a delay of half-an-hour to 45 minutes. And this continued. After every half-an-hour, the official or his colleague would come and say we have to wait on for another half-an-hour. After a long wait, some passengers even lost their cool.”
 
 Akash, another passenger flying to Ahmedabad, tweeted, “SpiceJet flight SG524 (14th July) from Pune to Ahmedabad is delayed … Already no response from SpiceJet at Pune airport.”
 
 Another passenger travelling with his family said, “The problem with all the airlines these days lies is they do not provide correct information to the passengers. Each time there is a delay, they just say ‘technical reasons’. When you pressurize them to give information, many a times they tend to become rude and provide no information. 
 
 The same happened in this case, too. Their response was very poor. I could see passengers having heated arguments with the staffers. The whole scenario was absolutely chaotic.”
