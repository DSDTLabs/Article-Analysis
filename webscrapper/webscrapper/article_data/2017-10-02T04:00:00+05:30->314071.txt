 The initiative saw men and women from police cleaning a 5km stretch of the beach filled with dirt, plastic and Ganesh idols. They also cleaned Saifee Villa that houses Gandhi Memorial Museum — the place where Mahatma Gandhi stayed during his visit to Dandi in 1930. It had remained unattended to so far by the authorities. Police and volunteers also cleaned Prarthana Sthal near Saifee Villa.
 
 “I visited Dandi a few months ago and noticed waste across the beach and at places of historical importance. We took up the task to clean Dandi and started the initiative on the birthday of Prime Minister. The clean beach will be dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi on his birth anniversary on Monday,” said Shamsher Singh, additional DGP, Surat range.
 
 Police and volunteers collected around 25 truckloads of waste from the beach. It took them several hours to clean Saifee Villa that had stains of pan and tobacco. “Initially, we started this drive with policemen on Sunday morning and later volunteers from Surat and other parts of south Gujarat joined us. Over 2,000 people are helping us in our efforts,” Singh said. 
 
 Police also installed notice boards that request people to stop littering and use dustbins. Cement dustbins have been installed to collect waste and keep the beach clean. Posters with photos of the beach before and after the drive have been put at the beach. Police plan to install CCTV cameras and build a watch tower to ensure security and maintain cleanliness at the beach.
 
 “It was a noble cause taken up by police. This will lead others to work in this direction and help keep the historical place clean,” said Kalubhai Danger, who is working in Dandi under the World Bank's programme of cleanliness and environment which is being implemented by Gujarat Ecology Commission and Gujarat Vidyapith.
