Guess what   is called on the set of his   show ' '? Selfie King! That’s because he is constantly taking selfies. While people may think that’s his new obsession,   has his own reasons. He says, “It keeps me in check as I have to compete with youngsters. I’ve got two handsome boys playing my sons, two pretty girls playing my daughters-in-law and now, there are two pretty women playing my wives! I have to compete with all of them, so yes, I focus on my looks and a mobile in hand keeps me in check!” Rajev says most of his colleagues too are fitness conscious and conversations on the set range from health to nutritious food. “There’s a lot of positivity and that’s what I love about my workplace,” he signs off.
