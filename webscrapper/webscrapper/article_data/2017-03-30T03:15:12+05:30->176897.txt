NEW DELHI: Students, teachers and non-teaching staff of   marched in solidarity against the scheme to grant   to colleges of the varsity. They raised a plethora of other issues plaguing the staff like hold-up of pensions, implementation of retrospective academic performance indicators (APIs), which has led to hold in promotions, and non promotion of staff.

 The primary concern of teachers and students present at the rally was regarding the issues opening a college to autonomy will bring. “The UGC has been pushing to bring more self-financing courses into a college. When running in self-financing mode, colleges will naturally move towards a fee hike which will bring a significant change in the pay structure and service conditions of teachers and the non-teaching staff,” said Abha Dev Habib, a professor with Miranda House. She added that the getting autonomy will also affect the student-teacher ratio. 
 
 The autonomy move, according to professors, will not just affect the teaching staff but also the karamcharis. “The current statute ties the hands of the governing body, which cannot remove anybody from the rolls right away,” said Habib.
 
 Professors also called the step towards autonomy nothing but “privatisation of colleges”.
