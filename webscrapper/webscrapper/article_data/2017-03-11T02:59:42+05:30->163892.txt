NEW DELHI: Outstanding dues of Rs 4,911.07 crore, recoverable from discoms, have adversely affected the cash flow of   Ltd (IPGCL) and   Ltd (PPCL), due to which the two companies had to resort to heavy short-term borrowings, reveals the latest  . 

 The audit covering the period from 2011-12 to 2015-16 has exposed “deficiencies in capacity addition programmes, excess consumption of fuel, non-achievement of generation targets and plant load factor norms due to less scheduling of power, unplanned major shutdowns and delays in repair and maintenance”.
 
 In a section on “outstanding energy bills”, the CAG has said that both BSES discoms—Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL)—were defaulters from October 2010 and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) from April 2014 onwards. “As on March 31, 2016, an amount of Rs 4,911.07 crore (IPGCL: Rs 1,722.54 crore and PPCL: Rs 3,188.53 crore) was recoverable from them,” the report said.
 
 It has also noted that out of planned commission of six 3,340MW plants by the end of 12th Five-Year Plan, only 1,500MW PPS-III, Bawana, has been commissioned while other projects held up either due to non-availability of gas or lack of land.
 
 The audit has highlighted that operational performance of power plants was sub-optimal. Gross station heat rate of the plants was higher than the norms, resulting in excess consumption of fuel of Rs 125 crore. “Further auxiliary energy consumption of these power plants was higher than the norms, leading to excess consumption of 154.75MUs, valued at Rs 48.04 crore. 
 
 The CAG report has recommended that the power generating companies must take steps to improve financial management to ensure that payment of penalties is minimised.
