HYDERABAD: City doctors from   report an alarming trend which indicates a rise in number of young working professionals falling prey to sudden cardiac arrests at the workplace. Reason: Stress and anxiety coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, say doctors.

 Stressing the importance of timely treatment in preventing fatalities caused by an out-of-hospital, sudden cardiac arrest, surgeons point out the patient can even become brain dead, if emergency treatment is not given within five minutes of the arrest.
 
 “We see at least one or two cases of sudden cardiac arrests at software companies, every month. In one particular case, an employee of a leading   who developed a sudden cardiac arrest at the workplace could not be revived since he arrived at the hospital late and because no emergency response treatment was given to him at his office. Brain cells tend to die within five minutes of a sudden cardiac arrest, making it extremely important to ensu re that emergency procedures such as Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compression and shocks through a defibrillator, are given to the patient,“ said Dr Sharat Reddy , consultant interventional cardiologist and director of the Cathlab at Maxcure Hospitals in Madhapur.
 
 According to doctors, while it is mainly people with a history of cardiac illness or weakness who can develop sudden cardiac arrests, even those without any pre-existing medical conditions are often prone to cardiac arrests at the workplace owing to stress.
 
 “In fact even those without any prior cardiac complications are seen falling prey to such arrest because of stress and anxiety . We have identified the target-based performance evaluation, followed by many companies, as one of the leading causes stress among for professionals,“ said cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Krishna Prasad. The absence of an emergency response system in most IT firms, only adds to the fears of doctors.
