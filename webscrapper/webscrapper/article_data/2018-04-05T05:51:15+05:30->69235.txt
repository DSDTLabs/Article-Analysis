GURUGRAM:   has proposed a budget of Rs 1,884 crore for the financial year 2018-19, a 30% increase from Rs 1,425 crore in 2017-18. For this period, the corporation has estimated its income at Rs 2,290 crore, an increase of 43% from the previous year. The budget will be tabled for approval in the House on Monday, April 9.

 MCG officials said the 30% increase in the budget estimate is due to increase in the sanitation budget and on environmental projects, coupled with takeover of Huda sectors. “We can’t give definitive numbers, as the budget is yet to be approved by the House. However, there will be special focus on sanitation and increasing the city’s green cover, in this year’s budget,” said a senior MCG official.
 
 The proposed budget document, accessed by TOI, states MCG has generated Rs 1,254 crore income till February, which is around 79% of the total estimated income of Rs 1,602.90 crore. Another Rs 366 crore is expected to have been generated in March, taking the actual income for 2017-18 close to the budget estimate. Clearly, MCG’s actual income, as a percentage of the income estimated in the 2017-18 budget, has considerably improved in the last financial year.
 
 While the corporation received Rs 570 crore compared to the budgeted receipt of Rs 1,836 crore in 2016-17, the income generated in 2015-16 was Rs 554 crore, against an estimated income of Rs 1,788 crore. Officials said the increase in receipts for 2017-18 is mostly due to a sharp rise in property tax collections, along with increase in stamp duty receipts. TOI had earlier reported that MCG has seen an increase of 114% in property tax collections for 2017-18, compared to 2016-17. 
 
 Interestingly, there is a significant increase in the proposed budget for sanitation expenses — from Rs 45 crore last year to Rs 126 crore in the current fiscal. “Moreover, wages of sanitation workers have been put under a separate head,” reads the budget document. 
 
 There is also a fund of Rs 20 crore for the rejuvenation and maintenance of water bodies, bunds and sewerage, and Rs 10 crore for other environmental projects. “There has been a constant focus on reviving water bodies within MCG. Work has already started in Sukhrali, and it will begin soon in Basai too,” said an MCG official in the know.
 
 Sources told TOI that MCG officials are also working on a green plan which will focus on increasing green cover in public spaces. Rs 5 crore has also been allocated to provide cattle feed and medicines for the Carterpuri gaushala.
