NAGPUR: City police chief K   is set to introduce an unique manpower management system at the police station level as a mandatory practice. The top cop has already set the process in motion engaging senior officers for implementation.

 The cops, engaged in duty allotment responsibility at the police stations, had been already addressed by the senior officers like additional CP Shamrao Dighaokar and DCP  . The cops, given the duty allotment task, have been provided a 14-point list to gauge the abilities of the cops whom they are supposed to assign duties.
 
 There had been several instances of allegations cropping up regarding various issues like partiality and bias in duty allotment. The charges of corruption too had surfaced regarding duty allotment. The city police top brass has now delved into a damage-control mode to fine tune the system.
 
 Venkatesham said that there would be no random distribution of the work from now on. “The cops would be entrusted with the responsibility of a particular task only if he or she has the aptitude for it, not otherwise,” he said. “The staff engaged in duty allotment will be groomed to have an eye for such details in the other's capacity to approach a particular task,” said the top cop. He also added that the senior cops are reviewing the development of this task at the police station level.
