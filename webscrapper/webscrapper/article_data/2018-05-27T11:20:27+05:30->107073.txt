 / THRISSUR: One more person succumbed to the   on Saturday, even as health minister   claimed that the infection, which has so far taken 12 lives in the state, has been brought under control. Kalyani, 62, the latest fatality, had been admitted to Kozhikode medical college hospital on May 16. She was a relative of Janaki, who died of Nipah infection on May 20. 

 Speaking at a function at Thrissur medical college hospital, the health minister said early identification of the virus and effective countermeasures helped control its spread. “All 21 samples sent for analysis were tested negative for Nipah virus as per results received on Friday. Even the three cases reported from Malappuram were found to be linked to the virus source at Perambra. This gives us reason to hope,” the minister said.
 
 She also clarified that human monoclonal antibody, the anti-Nipah drug to be imported from Australia, will be used only after following protocols set by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organisation (WHO). “We are constituting a special team on Nipah virus management, and after controlling the current outbreak this team will work on the project to develop the antibody. WHO officials have sought samples from infected persons in Kerala and we have agreed to this,’’ the minister said.
