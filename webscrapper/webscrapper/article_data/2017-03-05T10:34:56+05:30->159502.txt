NAGPUR: The city will get its 52nd mayor on Sunday when BJP’s mayoral candidate Nanda Jichkar is formally elected to the post. Congress and BSP too have fielded their candidates, for the post but the two parties, even if they join hands, are far behind BJP in the number game. BJP has 108 members in   (NMC) house while Congress has 28 and BSP has 10. The election will be held in Town Hall, Mahal.

 Congress has fielded Sneha Nikose and Nitish Gwalbanshi for the post of mayor and deputy mayor while BSP’s respective candidates are   and Narendra Walde.
 
 Once the new mayor is elected, the election for the post of deputy mayor will be held. The party leaders will then submit the names of standing committee members and co-opted corporators. The number of members in the NMC standing committee are decided on the basis of the party’s strength in the NMC house and no elections are held. BJP has twelve members in the committee, Congress has three while BSP has one.
 
 There are five co-opted corporators in NMC house. BJP will appoint four of them on the basis of its strength while Congress will appoint the fifth one.   president Vikas Thakre, who had lost the election, may be Congress’ nominee. BJP is likely to co-opt veteran party members, who were not provided the party ticket for NMC elections.
