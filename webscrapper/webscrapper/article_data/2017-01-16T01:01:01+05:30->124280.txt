NAVI MUMBAI: A fake overseas   was busted and two men were arrested from Sanapada last week. As of now, 20 victims have been   collectively of around Rs 10.44 lakh, said assistant inspector Sachin Hire.

 The three accused, Omkar Talekar, Sunny Singh and Anand Pagare had accepted fees for visa, medical, air tickets fare and processing fees from job seekers, mostly hailing from Bihar and UP. The trio closed their   office in October and disappeared only to resurface in   later.
 
  “The accused registered their agency through a chartered accountant. After cheating several job seekers at their Vashi office, named Skyway Jobs Pvt Ltd, they shut down their office in October and shifted to another one, Omanand Human Resources Pvt Ltd at Sanpada railway station premises,” added Hire. 
 
  Talekar was arrested on January 10 from Sanpada and led the cops to his partner Singh. The latter was arrested on January 13 from Chembur camp. Pagare is still untraceable. The accused had advertised in newspapers about job vacancies like store keeper, helper, technican, peon, ITI welders, plumbers and electricians in Dubai. Applicants such as the complainant, Bablu Sharma from Ghansoli had paid money only to be cheated by the trio.
