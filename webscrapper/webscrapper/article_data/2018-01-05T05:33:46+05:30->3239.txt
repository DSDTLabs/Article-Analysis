 The height restriction in Lonavala municipal council area is 12 metres (approximately ground plus three).
 
 An urban development department official said when the Development Plan (DP) and Development Control Regulations (DCR) were sanctioned in 2005, the development control rules stipulated that fire norms will apply to all multi-storied buildings.
 
 "This was interpreted as being applicable to even ground plus one structures. Hence, all such plots had to have an 6m open space around them. This made construction difficult," he said.
 
 The council has a court appointed committee to sanction building plans. The committee too had recommended that the DC rule must be modified. 
 
 "It was only after the courts ordered the demolition of a building in a case for not following   that the issue gained urgency. Now we have clarified that the norms that are applicable across   will be applicable in Lonavala too," said the official. However, for all educational, assembly, mercantile, institutional, industrial, storage, hazardous and mixed occupancy buildings the fire safety norms will apply if the plot size is more than 5,000 sq feet.
