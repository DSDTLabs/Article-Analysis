THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The  , finally, seems to have abandoned the proposed   hydroelectric project, for want of a consensus in the LDF, or at least shelved it for the time being.

 Power minister M M   told the assembly on Monday that the project, though under government’s consideration, did not have consensus in the LDF for its implementation. “The LDF has not taken a decision on it as there’s no consensus, without which the project will not be implemented,” he said, while responding to   V D Satheesan’s remarks on the proposed project during the discussion on demand for grants for power sector.
 
 The Congress MLA said that there was no use trying for a consensus between the ruling and opposition parties for implementing Athirappilly project as the latter was strongly against it.
 
 The minister, however, said hydel projects, in spite of its limitations, were still the most profitable source of energy. “The electricity board has prepared an action plan for completion of various small hydel projects, which are now at different stages of execution,” Mani said.
 
 Mani said that the government was ready to tap all possible sources of renewable energy, including solar and wind. “In solar power, the state has now a generating capacity of 120 megawatts, which can be enhanced up to 500 megawatts. For maximum utilisation of solar power thus generated, the government might even consider selling it to private entities and for use in agriculture,” he said, adding that the board has already taken a decision to enhance the capacity.
 
 On wind energy, the minister said 22 more windmills will be erected at   in Idukki, besides identifying similar potential places in other districts to generate wind energy.
 
 “Still, Kerala is producing electricity which can meet only 30% of its requirement, and the balance power is being bought from other sources. The current distribution loss is estimated at 14% and the plan is to bring it down to 10% with the aid of technology,” he said.
