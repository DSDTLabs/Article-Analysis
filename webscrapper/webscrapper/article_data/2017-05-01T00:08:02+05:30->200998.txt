Pune: From this academic year, a handful of students from standards III, V and VIII will take part in a learning assessment programme designed by the Centre to fine-tune the system of education in India. 

 The assessment tests will be held at random, and will involve about 3% of India’s students. The Centre will take help from state governments to conduct this exercise, according to Anil Swarup, school education and literacy secretary from the human resources development ministry.
 
 The programme aims at the assessment of curriculum, the teaching methods and the learning ability of students.
 
 “The programme has been declared for this year,” Swarup said on the sidelines of a two-day regional workshop for educational officers. “A notification will soon be issued following which the parameters and questionnaires will be formulated. The on-field assessment will take place in September and October while the feedback assessment will be completed by the end of December. Changes will be introduced in the last quarter of the academic year based on the assessment and feedback,” he added. 
 
 Swarup said about 3% of the children will take part in the exercise in which state governments will partner with the Centre. The on-field tests will be conducted completely at random. Improvements will be made based on the report. 
 
 The regional workshop was attended by more than 100 officers from the school education departments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Daman & Diu and Nagar Haveli, and NGO representatives.
 
 Swarup said similar workshops were planned in Guwahati, Bengaluru and Chandigarh.
 
 Earlier in day, state education minister Vinod Tawade launched the ‘Mitra’ app designed to help teachers enhance their teaching skills.
