Ranchi deputy commissioner   said, "SDO   has been made the Ranchi nodal officer for the initiative 'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' spearheaded by the NITI Aayog. The district administration is all set to put in every effort to increase Ranchi's scores and rankings. We have been directed to upload progress of the district on a daily basis to monitor development in the core focus areas. Monthly meetings will also be held at the district level to identify the problem areas in the district and remove them." 

 NITI Aayog had conducted a training session for key district level officers from the 101 districts to operate the dashboard developed for monitoring and provide real time MIS ( ) reports for delta ranking (real time ranking) which will begin from April 1. It will calculate 'distance to frontier' data from the uploads, which are defined as distance of progress of a particular 'aspirational district' from the best performing districts and the nation in each focus area.
