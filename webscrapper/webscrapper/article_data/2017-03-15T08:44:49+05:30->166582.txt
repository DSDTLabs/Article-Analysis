MANGALURU: Even as the ruling Congress in Karnataka is busy preparing strategy for Nanjangud and Gundlupet byelections, former KPCC president   on Tuesday predicted that the party would lose both the seats if Siddaramaiah continued as chief minister. 

 The veteran Congress leader urged the Congress high command to replace Siddaramaiah with home minister   immediately stating that it is the only solution to save the party in Karnataka. 
 
 “Congress will lose both Nanjangud and Gundlupet seats because of Siddaramaiah, who is arrogant. He has already enjoyed the power as CM for more than three years. Now let the high command take a decision to replace him with Parameshwara, a dalit leader. It will help party to win the bypolls,” Poojary said.
 
 Poojary also held Siddaramaiah responsible for SM Krishna’s ouster from the Congress. “It is because of Siddaramaiah’s arrogance, the party has lost a senior most and influential leader like S M Krishna. Had Siddaramaiah given him (Krishna) due respect and sought his suggestions, he would not have left hte party,” Poojary said
