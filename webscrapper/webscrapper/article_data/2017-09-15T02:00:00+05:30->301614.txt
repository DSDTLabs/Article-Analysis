PATNA: Six members of a family, including five minors, drowned in the Ganga near Maranchi village at Mokama, about 100km from here, on Thursday morning. 

 The incident took place around 7am when all of them had gone to take bath in the river which flows across the village. The victims include 65-year-old   Singh and his five grandchildren – Nikki Kamari (13), Kajal Kumari (12), Mridula Kumari (10),   (8) and Anmol Kumar (11). 
 
 “Kajal, Maula and Mridula were daughters of Pawan’s elder son  , a farmer. Nikki and Anmol, on the other hand, were children of Pawan’s younger son  , a government employee,” said Marachi police station SHO Munna Kumar.
 
 The incident occurred when one of the girls slipped into deep water. Soon, two others kids jumped in the river in an effort to save her, but they too started drowning. Seeing this, their grandfather, Pawan, dived into water to rescue the children. However, he too failed in his efforts and was drowned. 
 
 Four of the bodies were immediately fished out by the locals. Later, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team rushed to the spot and took out two other bodies. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has expressed grief over the incident. He later instructed the district administration officials to provide all possible help to the family. 
 
 Sources in the chief minister’s office said the district administration has also been asked to provide ex gratia to the next of kin of each of the deceased without any delay.
