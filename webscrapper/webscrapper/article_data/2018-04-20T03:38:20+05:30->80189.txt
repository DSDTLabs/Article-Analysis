AGRA: Surendra  , a Noida property dealer, used a 24-year-old woman who works with a chartered accountant’s firm to honey-trap Salman Malik, a Dadri-based scrap dealer, to get back Rs 10 lakh he had loaned three years ago. 

 The girl, whose family is known to Gurjar, was asked to accompany Malik to Agra and click “cosy” photos which could later be used to blackmail Malik. But the plot went horribly wrong when Malik, who came with another friend, raped the woman in his car close to Yamuna Expressway. Later, his friend raped her too. 
 
 Gurjar was arrested on Thursday. According to police, the two gagged her and raised the volume of the car’s stereo before taking turns to rape her. “Her medical examination has revealed genital injuries. The DNA samples of the accused have been sent for tests,” Mathura SP (city) Shravan Kumar Singh told TOI. 
 
 The incident occurred near   area of Mathura, 15 km off the expressway, last Saturday and was reported by the woman almost immediately after the alleged assault. But she didn’t name Gurjar in her complaint at that time. Later, when cops checked her call records and found 72 conversations between the two in the past fortnight, they confronted her again. 
 
 That’s when she broke down and told them how Gurjar had threatened to kill her younger brother if she named him in the FIR. The SP said , “The survivor belongs to   and her father is a farmer.” The survivor told police that Gurjar had assured her that nothing would happen to her. 
 
 However, when she called him up soon after the rape, he didn’t respond. That’s when she dialed the police control room.
