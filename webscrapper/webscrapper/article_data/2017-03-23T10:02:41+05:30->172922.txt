BENGALURU: The Karnataka government is contemplating adopting   below PWD bridges and along the river valleys for storage of water. 

 Replying to a calling   issued by   on Wednesday, minor irrigation minister   said the government has taken note of the initiatives in the neighbouring states and is planning to adopt them. “Building barrages made of fibre below the bridges has helped Maharashtra create several water storage facilities, while in Telangana there has been a novel approach of digging barrages for water storage along river valleys. This has helped in digging out silt, which are used by farmers in their farm land for manure and created several spots for water storage. Both these schemes are being explored by the state,“ he said.
 
 The government is also trying to converge all lake development schemes of the major, minor, RDPR and agriculture department schemes and make a comprehensive plan for water storage. The minor irrigation department may be the supervisory authority for the lake development authority which is set to take charge of 32,000  , he added.
 
 Jayachandra said the government is keen on resolving the crisis in 43 taluks, which have exhausted all water resources and overexploited the ground water levels. Subsequently, it will look at 147 taluks where ground water resources are at a critical level.
