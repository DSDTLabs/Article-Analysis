SAMASTIPUR: The police failed to make any breakthrough in the murder of   Brajesh, a scribe of a Hindi daily and owner of a brick-kiln, at village   under Bibhutipur police station of Samastipur district. Brajesh was shot on Tuesday evening.
 
  Rosera SDPO   said on Wednesday, “Apparently, the murder was committed by criminals who had been hired. We are conducting raids to nab the criminals.”
  
  Brajesh’s elder brother Shyam Kishore has lodged an FIR against nine persons, including local JD(U) MLA Kamal Kishore Singh’s brother Lal Babu Singh. The police sources said there was simmering discontent among the villagers after the killing.
  
  Working Journalists Union’s Samastipur unit condemned the murder and demanded immediate arrest of the killers.
