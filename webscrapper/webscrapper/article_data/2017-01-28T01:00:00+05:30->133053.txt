 Millia Islamia, which already has a Mass   (MCRC), recently launched its first Film Club.   actress and the former chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification,  , inaugurated the club.

 "Film Club is a necessity in any big university, as it provides a platform and a forum where you can exchange ideas, critique and appreciate historical, classics and contemporary films. It is a great medium for communication and nowadays, more films are used to depict issues, which can be done so well through this medium. This is the time for students to be image and media literate. You canâ€™t be a passive recipient of images, you have to engage with images and read their subtexts. These are critical things that will be taught to the students by a film club," the actress said.
