AHMEDABAD: The city has been turned into a   with more than 7,000   guarding the 7-km-long road show, from Shahibaug to Mahatma Gandhi’s  , to be held to welcome with Gujarati hospitality PM   and his Israeli counterpart   and his wife Sara on Wednesday. 

 On the route of the road show, 32 stages – representing each state of India — have been set up, bearing the name of each state in Hindi and Hebrew. Artists in the traditional dress will perform folk dances of the particular state when the cavalcade passes by. Life-sized cutouts of Modi and his Israeli counterpart are placed at various points near the Sabarmati riverfront and Subhash Bridge, on the route of the road show which will last for about half an hour.
 
 According to state police officials, 50,000 people are expected to arrive for the road show, and entry will be permitted at 20 points. A separate stage has been set up for the Bene Israel community, native Jews who settled in India long ago, in front of the Sabarmati Ashram.
 
 Police in coordination with Israeli agencies have scanned the route of the road show and held a dress rehearsal on Tuesday. Entry will be restricted to common people at Sabarmati Ashram. Police officials said that personnel have already been deployed along the route. A separate state police control room has been set up along with two separate control rooms — one each for Ahmedabad district and Ahmedabad city.
 
 The PMs will fly in to inaugurate the campus of the International Centre for Entrepreneurship and Technology (iCREATE) near Sanand.
