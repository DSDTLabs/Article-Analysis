MUMBAI/KOLKATA:   ( ) president   on Saturday ruled out immediate merger of the I-League and the Indian Super League ( ). Patel also categorically stated that the I-League will remain the country's top-tier tournament for the next two-three years.

 The AIFF president, who meet representatives of   and   in Mumbai, told TOI: "There will not be any merger. Yes, there are plans to expand the ISL and strengthen the I-League. Let's not rush into anything just yet. After all, we have to design a road map for Indian football in the next few of weeks. We will consult the   about what's best for us and then decide. But as of now, I-League is the official league and that will not change."
 
 According to AIFF's latest proposal, ISL and I-League would be staged simultaneously. The ISL will be revamped with more teams coming in and held over seven months with matches played on the weekends. Patel's announcement was a source of great relief for top Indian clubs like Mohun Bagan, EB and the newly crowned I-League champions  , who were dead against the merger, but it left many questions unanswered.
 
 Will it be feasible to run the two leagues at the same time? Teams from which league will qualify for the   and the AFC Cup? There is no clarity on either issue.
 
 Having two leagues is obviously not ideal. Even the national team coach   is averse to the idea. But Patel was adamant, saying that two leagues were required to fully tap footballing talent in the country.
