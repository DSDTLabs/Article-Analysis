A complaint was lodged at Kaliachak police station by Momin’s wife Julekha at the NGO’s behest. Accordingly, the contractor who had sent Momin to Gujarat, where he worked for Rs 200 a day, was contacted. He reached Kolkata with two associates on May 29.
 
 Momin said: “I was thrashed for nothing. I could not even tell my wife about it. Thanks to Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, I have a got a new lease of life.”
 
 Samirul Islam of the NGO said: “With the video going viral, Momin might be attacked again. The memory of Afrajul is still fresh, so we did not want to take risks. It is unfortunate no one has been arrested yet.”
