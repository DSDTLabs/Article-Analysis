SURAT: A passenger stunned the airport staff and security personnel on Friday when he staged a dharna with banners to protest against   authorities for cancelling his ticket from Surat to Patna. 

 A schoolteacher  , residing in   near Surat, had booked morning flight of SpiceJet from Surat to Delhi and onward journey from Delhi to Patna in IndiGo three months ago. However, SpiceJet had announced cancellation of the morning   service due to fog in Delhi airport till February 10, 2018, last month. 
 
 Rai told TOI, “I had booked the ticket from Surat to Patna three months ago. If at all the flight was cancelled due to fog, the airline should have informed me about the change in the flight. I came to the airport to board the morning flight and was told that it had been cancelled till February 10.” 
 
 Rai added, “I protested and sat on dharna at the airport. After four long hours, SpiceJet staff came up with a solution and they booked my ticket in evening Delhi flight and onward journey to Patna on Saturday morning from Delhi.”
 
 Sources said Rai had booked the ticket to meet his ailing father in Patna on January 12. Despite cancellation of the morning service, Rai had not cancelled the ticket and insisted that the airlines fly him to Patna at any cost. After four-hour drama at the airport on Friday morning, Rai was convinced to travel in evening Delhi flight and onward journey to Patna on Saturday. 
 
 SpiceJet sources said the passenger had booked the ticket on flight SG-474, which was suspended till February 10, 2018, due to fog schedule on Surat-Delhi route and onward to Delhi-Patna sector on Indigo. Since none of the airlines takes liability of missing onward connection on other airlines, passenger was given the option of evening Delhi flight on SG -824, but he insisted on flying directly to Patna. Considering his age, SpiceJet authorities gave him connection till Patna via Delhi.
