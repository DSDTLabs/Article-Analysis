NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra Cricket Association ( ) made history on Monday by appointing a woman ­30-year-old   ­as its treasurer. This is the first time that a woman will be a senior office-bearer of any state cricket association or even the  .

 The MCA seems to have taken a cue from the recommendations of the   (CoA) to appoint at least two women representatives in the governing body of the state units. The members met to reap point Abhay Apte as the MCA president, and Priyanka was also unanimously picked as the treasurer.
 
 According to Apte, who was instrumental in pushing Priyanka's name for the post, her appointment was done purely on merit after the previous treasurer Vikas Kakatkar quit on health grounds. “This is perhaps the first time in the history of BCCI that a woman office-bearer has been elected. Priyanka represents one of the founder clubs, the Club of Maharashtra, here and her appointment was unanimous in the general body of MCA. Everyone supported her candidature and she rightly deserves to be in cricket administration,” Apte told TOI.
 
 Priyanka, a management professional working with a major e-retail multinational, and involved in cricket administration for last four years, sounded elated after getting elected. “I am overwhelmed by the support of the MCA members. I hope to give it my best shot and hopefully I can prove my worth in the association. I am looking forward to working for the game,” Priyanka said.
 
 “I played cricket during my childhood days but now I follow the game passionately,” she said, adding that she had actively taken part in the administration of badminton in the past. 
 
 Priyanka candidature was not opposed by outgoing MCA boss Ajay Shirke. Sources said there was pressure from BCCI for Apte to take over MCA's presidency as the state didn't have anyone to handle October's international match between India and New Zealand.
