HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday asked Telangana to be a trendsetter in preventing child marriages and rescuing child brides caught in the cobweb of such marriages and suffering untold miseries.

 The   of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice K  , which converted a letter written by B Mahalatha and 10 other child brides into a  , said that it would soon appoint an amicus curiae to assist the court in arriving at a meaningful conclusion that will help the girls return to normalcy and the state to effectively reach out to the victims.
 
 “At that tender age, minors will have no say in these matters,” the Bench said.
 
 The Bench gave notices to the chief secretary, principal secretaries of women and child welfare, medical and health department and legislative affairs wing asking them to file their counter. Noting that the problem is seemingly more prevalent in Telangana, the Bench said that AP too is not free from this. The case will be heard after four weeks.
