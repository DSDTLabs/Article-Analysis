Though the cargo complex in the   handles 250 tonnes of engineering goods and perishable items for export every month, the airport does not have freighter flight services. The cargo authorities export 125 tonnes of engineering goods through passenger flights to Singapore and  . The remaining 125 tonnes of engineering and perishable goods are sent to the Bengaluru and Chennai airports to be airlifted to the US and Europe.

 "We have enough potential to export gold ornaments, engineering goods and perishable items. But we donâ€™t have freighter flight services from the Coimbatore cargo complex. If the international flight operators are ready provide freighter flight services to European countries, we could tap over 50% of exports of engineering and textile goods," said R Mahalingam, director, Coimbatore International Airport.
 
 Export of perishable goods from the Coimbatore cargo terminal stood at 806.5 tonnes between April 2017 and January 2018. It was 726.3 tonnes during 2016-17. Direct gold imports, however, have grown at a slower pace in 2017-18. The cargo complex here imported 4.6 tonnes of gold ornaments between April 2017 and January 2018, compared to 5.5 tonnes for 2016-17.
 
 Due to lack of international connectivity, Coimbatore handles a large chunk of domestic in-bound cargo as well. The volume of perishable goods bound for other airports during the first 10 months of 2017-18 is 35% higher than in 2016-17. Gold bars coming in to the Coimbatore cargo complex from other domestic airports has seen a growth of 45.7% to 126 tonnes between April 2017 and January 2018 compared to 2016-17. 
 
 "HDFC, SBI, ICICI and   imported gold bars from other countries every day and sold them to gold ornaments manufacturers. They imported 126 tonnes of gold bars in the past 10 months and all of it was sent to the Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai airports. From there, the gold bars were sent to the Coimbatore domestic inbound cargo. There is no international freighter flight connectivity to Coimbatore. So the banks imported gold bars from overseas to other airports," said a source from the cargo complex.
 
 "The gold rate changes every day. If the bank imports gold bars through the Coimbatore cargo complex, it will be cleared immediately by the customs officials. Only then can the bank sell the gold to the buyer at a profit. But the customs clearance takes at least two days for gold import clearance. So direct gold import from overseas has reduced in Coimbatore. Before 2015, we handled 5-6 tonnes of gold import every month and now we handle just 6 kg per annum," said an officer.
 
 According to cargo authorities, exports of engineering and perishable goods were good from the Coimbatore cargo complex in 2015-16.
 
 A total of 2,053 tonnes of goods were exported to various destinations through passenger flights from the Coimbatore International Airport and only 119 tonnes of engineering goods were imported from various countries in the Coimbatore cargo complex in 2015-16.
 
 In 2016-2017, the cargo complex handled 2,581 tonnes of engineering, perishable and textile goods for exports and imported only 99 tonnes of engineering goods.
