Actress   who plays Khushi in Sasural Simar Ka recently visited Manali for the second time and felt nostalgic along with her husband  . They visited many places again for the second time and fell in love again. When asked about the trip Jyotsna says," This was second visit to Manali and it was amazing and I felt like staying there forever. Music was all in my mind and was in a romantic mood because of the climate there in Manali." On being asked whether people recognised her as Khushi from Sasural Simar Ka she says,"  definitely people recognised me and cursed Khushi for her negative character and that was really funny. I will take all this as a compliment. Then I and my husband Nitesh went to   temple, it is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimba Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahabharata."
