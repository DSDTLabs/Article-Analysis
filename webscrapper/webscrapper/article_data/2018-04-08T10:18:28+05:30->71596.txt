MEERUT: Jailed   chief Chandrashekhar   has begun an indefinite hunger strike against what he called the “police harassment of innocent Dalit youths” following the Bharat Bandh violence of April 2.
 
 Azad has been lodged in UP’s   prison since his arrest in June last year for his alleged role in the Saharanpur riots.
 
 Azad announced his decision to a group of Bhim Army leaders who met him in jail on Friday. He later issued a letter in this regard. In the letter, Azad said, “My hunger strike will continue till the time police do not stop atrocities against youths of the Dalit Samaj who are being framed in fake cases following violence during the Bharat Bandh on April 2. It will continue until these cases are withdrawn and those stuffed into jails are released. I also demand adequate monetary compensation for the families of 11 Dalits who died during the nationwide agitation.”
 
 Delhi region in-charge of Bhim Army, Sujeet Samrat, said, “I was part of the group that met the Bhim Army chief. After hearing about the police action against innocent youths, Azad said he could at least go on a hunger strike, if not anything else as he is in jail himself, to seek justice for them.”
