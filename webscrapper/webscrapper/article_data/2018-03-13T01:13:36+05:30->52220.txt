NEW DELHI: Amid growing demand from traders and   to promulgate an ordinance to stop the   drive, Union housing and urban affairs minister   on Monday said the Centre has taken the right step to modify the   to bring relief to traders and residents as well.

 “Pass an ordinance, on what?..We don’t need an ordinance.. First of all no ordinance can be promulgated as Parliament is in session...Master Plan is a legal document and   is a statutory authority. We have the statutory right to amend the law and we have done it,” Puri said, hours after DDA filed its affidavit in the SC. 
 
 His comments came a day after   called an all-party meeting on Tuesday to find a way out. Puri said the housing secretary has talked to Delhi government and civic bodies for speedy filing of affidavits in the SC with regard to the proposed 351 mixed use roads. He alleged that successive Delhi governments had been sitting on the proposals for more than a decade after the MCD had forwarded them.
 
 Referring to an incident of scuffle between enforcement agencies and traders in Lajpat Nagar, Puri said violence will not be tolerated. South MCD commissioner claimed that the drive was against encroachment. He did not give a direct answer to whether all illegal activities started only in one or two months, which they came to know recently.
 
 In response to a specific question, LG Anil Baijal said the current actions were being undertaken by local bodies as per the directions of the monitoring committee for four violations. These are misuse of the area in the stilt meant for parking, encroachment and misuse on the government land, encroachment of forest land and unauthorised construction not covered under special provision law.
