AHMEDABAD: Soon after Memnagar was declared a  , chicken and poultry business was badly affected in Ahmedabad. However, of late, as the bird flu scare began fading, the business has shown signs of revival. Estimates suggest that on a normal day, close to 10 tonne chicken is traded in the city every day, which reduced to less than half after reports of bird flu surfaced.

 “Against a daily trade of around 700kg, we’ve been selling 300-400kg on a daily basis these days. The business has improved in the past week but it will take a while to resume normalcy,” said  , a meat trader near Vejalpur.
 
 Following the  , the civic body had ordered to shut certain shops, which further dampened the business for meat and poultry. “Our business was shut for about a week and even after it reopened, there was hardly any demand. However, the same has picked up now and we have been getting orders for about 150 kg chicken every day,” said  , yet another dealer for chicken and meat based in Jamalpur.
 
 “For eggs, the business has picked up fairly well. We’ve been getting bulk orders for the last couple of weeks from individual vendors as well as bakeries and restaurants,” said  , a poultry dealer in Jamalpur.
 
 Despite the gradual increase in demand, the price hasn’t been significantly affected. “The price is still at Rs 150 per kg chicken. It may be less for bulk orders. The business was adversely hit last month and we can’t afford to increase prices at this point,” said Akik Ahmed Farooqi.
