NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister   today said two Indian nationals were killed in the terrorist attack that took place in Istanbul, Turkey earlier in the day.

 “I have a bad news from Turkey. We have lost two Indian nationals in the Istanbul attack. Indian Ambassador is on way to Istanbul,” Swaraj tweeted.
 
  
 
 
 
 Abis Rizvi was CEO of Rizvi Builders and had produced a number of films including the 2014 movie 'Roar: The Tigers of the Sundarbans.'
 
 Swaraj also spoke to families of both Rizvi and Shah and conveyed her condolences. The External Affairs Ministry has also arranged for visas for the family members of the two victims who're leaving for Istanbul.
 
 "I have just spoken to Mr Akhtar Hassan Rizvi, father of Abis Rizvi. He and Mrs Rizvi also want to go to Istanbul. We are organising their visa. I have also spoken to Shri Ashok Shah father of Ms Khushi Shah and conveyed our condolences," Swaraj tweeted.
 
 A family member of Khushi said her brother Akshay Shah and cousin Hiren Chauhan are flying to Istanbul without visas and brought this to Swaraj's attention. Swaraj said their visas had been arranged.
 
 She added that she'd asked India's Ambassador in Turkey Rahul Kulshreshth to receive the relatives at the airport, and make all necessary arrangements.
 
 Earlier today, Prime Minister   conveyed his condolences to the government and people of Turkey after the Istanbul attack.
 
  
 
 As many as 39 people were killed, and dozens wounded earlier on Sunday, when a gunman stormed a popular Istanbul nightclub and sprayed bullets at revellers celebrating the New Year.
 
 There were reportedly as many as 700 people dancing to celebrate the New Year, which chimed in just over an hour before the attack.
 
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said a manhunt is under way.
