PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will seek a no-objection certificate (NOC) from defence authorities to construct a temporary bridge over Mula river at Bopkhel village. 

 Municipal commissioner   has assured the villagers that the bridge would be constructed in six months once they get the NOC. Following the assurance, Bopkhel resident Santosh Ghule called off his indefinite hunger strike on Thursday.
 
 “I met the municipal commissioner and discussed the problems being faced by Bopkhel’s residents and also [Ghule’s] hunger strike. The district collector presided over the meeting which was attended by civic, defence and other officials,” mayor   told TOI. 
 
 PCMC will ask for the NOC from various defence authorities, like Khadki Station Headquarters, Ammunition Factory Khadki (AFK), Army Base Workshop (ABW) and   (DEO). 
 
 An all-party delegation led by the mayor, Shiv Sena group leader Rahul Kalate, MNS corporator Sachin Chikhale and former corporator Maruti Bhapkar had met Ghule and asked him to call off the hunger strike that he had started on Monday. 
 
 There are 21,000 people residing in Bopkhel village, located along Mula river. Following a high court directive two years ago, defence authorities had closed the 2km-long Bopkhel-Dapodi road passing through the College of Military Engineering (CME) premises. The CME had constructed a temporary bridge in June 2015, but that too was removed last June. 
 
 Since then, the villager have faced many hardships as they have to take a 16km-long detour to reach the cantonment and the highway. 
 
 PCMC has also expressed willingness to construct a permanent bridge, and even prepared its design. A final approval from the defence ministry is awaited. Once that happens, the civic authorities can invite bids and assign work to the contractor.
