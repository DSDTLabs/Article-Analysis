KOLHAPUR: The district   along with the primary education board of the   ( ) has failed to generate positive response for the on-going   ( ) admission process.

 According to the reports, registration for the online admission process that started from February 9, has received merely 201 applications from across the district and only 156 applications from the city.
 
 Subhash Chougule, education officer (primary),  , said, “According to our primary reports, the admission application process is going on smoothly at the designated schools across the city and district. The help centres as of now has not received any complaint. However, we have received a complaint and are yet to decide on the course of action to be taken.”
 
 He added that the number of applications will rise in coming days. The department, earlier this month, sighting technical glitch in the system and extended the registration deadline from earlier February 21 to February 25.
 
 Sattappa Mohite, a city-based education activist, said the department is repeating the same mistake it committed the previous academic year, where the number of admissions were restricted to less than 10%. “Awareness among parents must be top priority for the department to gain admissions under RTE,” he said.
 
 Another city-based activist said, “For over 2,500 seats that offer free education to the beneficiaries in the district, the education department is hardly getting around 500 responses. This can is quite serious. In 2015-16, the department had got around 60% applications for the designated seats under the RTE. How come, the beneficiaries shrunk suddenly in 2016-17?”
 
 Under the RTE Act, economically and socially disadvantaged children, as well as those with disabilities, can be admitted in Class I or at the pre-primary stage, of private unaided schools. These children receive free education including textbooks, and other facilities.
