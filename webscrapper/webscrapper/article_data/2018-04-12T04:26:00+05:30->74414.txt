Vadodara: Citizens got an opportunity to highlight the traffic issues they face in different areas directly to the traffic police on Wednesday. From lack of parking spaces and poor road designs to wrong side drivers and stray cattle, Barodians posted their grievances on the social media accounts of the city police between 4pm and 6pm and the cops were quick to respond as well. 

 “It was a good interaction between the police and public as we took the initiative with a positive attitude. Many citizens posted comments and photos on our twitter, FB and Instagram accounts about the traffic issues. Some citizens also appreciated our initiative,” said Manoj Sashidhar, city police commissioner. 
 
 If Sharadh Unnithan raised the issue of lack of parking space on Race Course Road, Urvashi Bhatt suggested on twitter to implement odd even traffic rule like Delhi to reduce traffic and save fuel. Many users pointed to auto-rickshaw menace and traffic snarls caused due to it, especially in old city areas. Anil Tirgar pointed out the traffic rule violations through the bypass roads on the NH 8 while Aishwarya Kanitkar posted a photo of double lane parking on Rajmahal Road. Parth Vyas complained about the traffic signal system at Dandia Bazaar Crossroads. 
 
 “We will implement many of the suggestions given by the citizens. Some complaints were regarding road construction that come under other agencies. So, we will have to coordinate with them. But we will keep engaging like this with citizens in future as well,” Sashidhar told TOI. It was for the first time that the city police organized an online interaction about traffic issues with citizens. The initiative was taken by the police ahead of its drive of penalizing traffic offenders that will begin from April 14.
