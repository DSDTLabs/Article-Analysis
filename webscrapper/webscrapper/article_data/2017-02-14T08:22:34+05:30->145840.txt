THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   has taken exception to public works department’s order denying   infrastructural facilities to   sleuths in   in the state while probing cases referred to investigation agency.

 It is reliably learnt that the chief minister has ordered reversal of the order issued by the works department. Subsequently, the home department also issued an order providing facilities free-of-cost to the CBI team in the rest house at Kodungallur, for a case that is being probed.
 
 The order denying rent-free facilities was issued on July 28 last year with retrospective effect (with effect from August 14, 2014). The agency, that had taken up   murder case in September 2014, Payyoli Manoj murder case in January 2016 and Ramabhadran murder case in Kollam in October 2015, in which CPM activists were the prime accused, had suspected that the decision of the government was an attempt to hinder the smooth conduct of investigation.
 
 The order had not only cancelled the facility given by the government for the officials in PWD rest houses but to realise the rent for using the facilities since August 14, 2014. Subsequently, the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau also launched a quick verification against CBI officials occupying two rooms at Ernakulam rest house in connection with a case, and registered case against   and Ernakulam district collector for using rooms without paying rent.
 
 With the decision by the chief minister to overrule the PWD’s order in favour of the CBI, the case against the agency is likely to go in its favour.
