Rajkot:  ,  ,   

 The officials of Bhaktinagar police station, where the case against Dangar has been registered, produced Dangar before a court here, seeking her four-day remand. However, the court turned down the remand plea and sent Dangar to jail on Friday. 
 
 Mohammad Rauma (30), a resident of Kala Paththar quarters in Anandnagar Colony, had lodged a complaint against Dangar on September 9, following which the police had booked her under Sections 153 (K), 295 (K), 298 and 504 of Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act. 
 
 “Dangar had fled Rajkot in her own car. She had changed her name to Usha Dangar to conceal her identity. As a precautionary measure, she would change driver after every 200 km. She used ‘Just Dial’ services from Ahmedabad to hire drivers. We used to keep track of her mobile location, which showed her to be in Junagadh, Ahmedabad, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. Finally, she was traced to Ghaziabad, from where we caught her in her car,” an official from Bhaktinagar police station said.
