VADODARA: A   of Rs 52.36 lakh by an   who had borrowed the money from her to invest in his business.

 Complainant  , who had a sweet shop in Alkapuri, registered a case of cheating against  , who deals in spectacles in Bajwada near Mandvi, at Karelibaug police station on Saturday.
 
 Kesariya told the police in her complaint that Jaiswal approached her through her brother as he wanted to expand his business. Jaiswal had promised her that he would give her a part of profit if she too pools in some money. Lured by the offer, Kesariya paid Rs 52.36 lakh in different amount to Jaiswal in June 2014. In return of the money, Jaiswal gave an apartment in Harni to her as security.
 
 Jaiswal initially gave her Rs 1.44 lakh as the share of profit but a year later she decided to withdraw her investment as she needed money. However, Jaiswal refused to give the money to her saying that he did not have such a big amount in hand with him. But he gave the power of attorney of a bungalow in Harni to Kesariya as security and promised to return the money within a year.
 
 In May 2016 when Jaiswal could not return the money to Kesariya, he gave the possession and key of the bungalow to her. Couple of days later Kesariya learnt that the bungalow was not his and there was a dispute between him and the builder. Through the office of city survey, Kesariya also came to know that even the apartment which he had given as security in 2014 was sold off by Jaiswal to some other person.
