BENGALURU: Amid speculation that the newly appointed   team headed by general secretary   would   on who should head the   in an election year, the former was categorical that he has to acquaint himself with the political situation in Karnataka before deciding whether there was need for a change of guard in the party.

 Venugopal also chose to do away with the conventional method of holding the KPCC office-bearers’ meeting. Instead, along with his team of three secretaries -- Manickam Tagore, P C Vishnunadh and Madhu Yashki Goud (fourth member Sake Saijanath is abroad) – he held a one-on-one meeting with KPCC office-bearers, district unit presidents and chiefs of frontal organizations. 
 
 He was asked to submit a report to AICC vice-president   by May 22 on what the Congress strategy should be for the 2018 polls, before the five-member team sets out into the districts to meet the rank and file. 
 
 “We have not come here to elicit opinions on the continuation or change of KPCC president. We are here to study the political scenario,” a party source quoting Venugopal told TOI on Monday. 
 
 However, that did not stop party members and contenders for the KPCC president’s post from voicing their opinions during meetings. Party insiders said while a section of those who met the AICC team wanted the Congress to face the 2018 elections under a collective leadership and not as chief minister Siddaramaiah was projecting, another group wanted incumbent G Parameshwara to be divested of one responsibility -- either the home ministry or president’s post -- as he was unable to give quantity and quality time to both. Another faction felt it is too late to make a change in the state unit leadership if Siddaramaiah’s thrust on Ahinda should be maintained. 
 
 While a large number of leaders thronged the airport and party office to greet Venugopal on his arrival, chief minister Siddaramaiah was in Mandya and Mysuru. He is expected to meet Venugopal on Tuesday.
 
 Venugopal, who will be interacting with MLAs on Tuesday, has been tasked with setting the tone for elections by curbing desertions and infighting. He wanted the members to give their “Tan Man Dhan” to take the party’s mission forward, and reportedly cited the party’s recent success in Punjab where 25 lakh members were mobilized for the election. They were asked to work hard to reach every booth and household and take up burning issues effectively.
 
 Parameshwara, who received Venugopal at the airport, said he too is a strong contender for the KPCC post. “Why shouldn’t my name figure for the post of party unit chief again, when the high command sees me as capable of holding posts in the party and government?’’ he asked.
