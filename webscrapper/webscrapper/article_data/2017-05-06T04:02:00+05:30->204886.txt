AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Secondary and   (GSHSEB) announced on its website that class 12 science (fourth semester) results would be declared on Saturday after 5pm. 

 However, within half an hour, the notification was retracted by the   and, instead, a message appeared that the date for the results will be announced soon.
 
  The examinations were held across the state from March 15 to March 25. Around 1.40 lakh students had taken the exams.
 
 State education board officials said later said that paper assessment had been completed and the results were being prepared. GSHSEB chairman AJ Shah said they had planned to release the results on Saturday. However, due to some technical problems, the notification was withdrawn. “The new date will announced soon,” Shah said.
 
 Contrary to this, an official of the education department said that the state government had ordered the notification to be withdrawn as there was no need to announce early results. “The government said the results can be declared after GujCET,” the official said.
 
 Last year, GSHSEB had declared class 12   on May 17. Usually, the results of the board examination and GujCET are announced a week after GujCET is over. This time, GujCET will be held on May 10. Sources said that there is no chance of admissions beginning before May 15 and that it was still not clear why the board officials were in a rush to declare the results.
 
 The sources further said that recently a meeting of board officials was held where it was emphasized that the results should not be declared until GujCET and NEET are over. They reasoned that students whose board results were not up to their expectations will be too depressed to focus on the competitive exams.
