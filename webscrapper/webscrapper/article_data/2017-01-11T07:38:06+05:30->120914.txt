HYDERABAD: A 39-year-old lorry driver was arrested by the Musheerabad police on Monday for cheating and extorting money from doctors in the city.

 Based on a complaint lodged by Dr N Lakshmi Kanth, a resident of Ram Nagar, a case was registered against Mohd Sadiq alias Sajid under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 Police said that the accused Sajid was unhappy with his earnings. So he used to consult doctors by faking an illness. He then used to claim that he has been given a wrong treatment and   for it in return, claiming to be a sub-inspector of police, police further added.
 
 Incidentally, this was not his first offence. Sajid was arrested earlier in 2013 by the Tapachabutra police. They had recovered 85 cell phones from his possession then during the earlier arrest.
 
 After Sajid's arrest on Monday, police seized a cell phone and ` 3,800 cash from him. He will most likely be produced in the court on Wednesday. Further investigation in the case is also on.
