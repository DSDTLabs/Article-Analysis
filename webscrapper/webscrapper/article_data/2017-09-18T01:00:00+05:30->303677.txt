Shalini Pandey, who shot to fame with the Telugu film  , is all set to make her debut in Kollywood. She has been roped in to play the female lead opposite   after  , who was initially cast in the role, walked out of the project in a controversial manner.

 Says the film’s director,  , “We have cast Shalini after Lavanya’s unprofessional exit. We signed the agreement with her on Saturday. We also did a photo shoot with her as a look test, and we are extremely pleased with her performance. She is full of energy and I’m sure she will bring freshness to the role.” 
 
 The director adds that Shalini is willing to learn the language (she had dubbed for herself in Arjun Reddy, even though she did not know Telugu) and that has given him additional confidence. The team will begin shooting the film from October 11. “We will be shooting for a month at a stretch in India before going to London. We had previously planned to shoot from September 25 in London for 60 days, but with Lavanya leaving the project and the strike, it has created a financial loss and a logistical nightmare for us, as we have had to reschedule the entire shoot. We will still be shooting for two months in London,” he informs.
 
 The director has also lodged a complaint against Lavanya with the South Indian Film Chamber. “They (Lavanya’s side) came up with some baseless reasons for what they did, and the explanation they have provided itself raises questions. I need to officially give an answer to the Chamber to summon her, but I am currently busy rescheduling the shoot and do not want to divert myself of an unwanted direction,” he says.
