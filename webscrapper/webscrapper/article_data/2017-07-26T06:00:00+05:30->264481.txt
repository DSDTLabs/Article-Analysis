It was more than just a casual luncheon. 
A city-based ladies club recently organised a party for its members that featured an innovative fun quiz, a dress up competition as well as a dance and a skit act to motivate innovative minds in them. The highlight of the bash, centered on the ‘necessity is the mother of inventions’ theme, was the dress up segment where the ladies had to deck up with props provided to them. 
 The ambience was charged with laughter and excitement. The lavish spread too was a delight for the ladies, who binged on  ,   and   delicacies before calling it a day.
