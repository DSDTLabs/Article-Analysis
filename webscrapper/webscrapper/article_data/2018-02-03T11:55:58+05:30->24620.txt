CHANDIGARH: The district court framed   against MP   in a seven year old case pertaining to unlawful assembly and disobedience. Charges were framed under Section 188 of the IPC and the case will come up for hearing on March 1.

Bittu, along with 250 Youth   workers, allegedly took out a procession and gathered near gate number 1 of  . He had been informed that Section 144 of CrPC was in force and he could not take out a procession but he allegedly violated the orders and was booked. 
 
 A case was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector   on March 7, 2011 at the Sector 11 police station. Bittu was booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Defence counsel   maintained that Bittu was innocent, which he would prove in the course of the trial. 
 
 Bittu was granted bail in the case last year after he missed the three hearings, which led to the issuance of a non-bailable warrant against him. He was granted bail on May 12 after furnishing bonds worth Rs 25,000. It was given on the condition that he would cooperate with the police in the investigation. His counsel gave an undertaking that he would be present in all hearings. Still, he failed to appear in court despite repeated notices.
