SHIMLA: A case of unlawful assembly has been registered against eight people at   police station in connection with nearly 150 people blocking traffic on National Highway-5 on Saturday to protest “inaction” in the brutal gangrape and murder of a 16-year-old girl that has elicited widepsread outrage in the state.

 This is the first time since the protest demonstrations were started in the gangrape and murder case that police have registered a case against protesters. The case was registered on a complaint by head constable Snajeev Kumar, who had said that the mob came from the bus stand side of the city and then sat on a protest near the PWD rest house in Theog. With CBI starting its investigation into the case, protest demonstrations are expected to end, as people alleging lapses in police investigation were demanding that the case be handed over to the case central investigation agency. As situation is now returning to normal, police have started taking action against those taking law into their hands during protests.
 
 The eight men who were booked by Theog police on Saturday include: Rakesh Singha, Sohan Singh, Sandeep Verma, Bal Krishan, Suresh Verma, Mahender Verma, Arun Verma, and Arun Chandel. 
 
 Sanjeev Kumar alleged that the protesters had blocked the highway for more than two hours. After the custodial killing of one of the accused in the case by the alleged main accused inside the police lock-up, hundreds of protestors had attacked Kotkhai police station. Not only stones were pelted and police vehicles burnt, but one portion of the police station too was set on fire.
 
 Sources said now police wes preparing to register a case in this incident too by gathering information about people who had instigated the mob. Already, a list of people who led the mob during the protest has been prepared, they said.
