NEW DELHI: In a fresh submission to the   on Monday, the Centre sought scrapping of   and   among Muslims, saying these practices were not protected by fundamental right to practice religion.

 The Centre also said that these made women 
  . The Union government lamented that reforms in Muslim personal law had not happened in the last 65 years and Muslim women, who constitute 8% of the population, “remain extremely vulnerable” because of fear of instant divorce.
 
 “Even though it may be true to say that only some women are directly and actually affected by 
  and polygamy, the fact remains that every woman who is subject to the said law lives under threat, fear or prospect of these practices being invoked against her, which in turn impacts her status, her choices, her conduct and her right to life with dignity (guaranteed under Article 21, right to life),” stated the fresh written submissions filed by the Centre in 
  through advocate  .
 
 The government termed the practices of triple talaq and polygamy as patriarchal notions that impeded women’s role in society. “Gender inequity has ripple effect on the rest of the community, preventing it from partaking in full, liberties guaranteed by a modern Constitution,” the Centre added. 
 
 Referring to All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s stand that practices of triple talaq,   and polygamy might be undesirable but were part of essential practice under the religion, Centre said no “undesirable” practice could be elevated to the status of an “essential practice”.
