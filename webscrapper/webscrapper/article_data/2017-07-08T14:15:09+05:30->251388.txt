TIRUMALA: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( ) is all set to introduce a new registration system for rooms form July 12. Explaining the new system, executive officer   on Friday said that of the available 6,600 rooms, 2,000 were allotted online while the remaining 4,600 rooms will be allotted in the token system. 

 The registration will be opened in two slots at 6 am and 2 pm with 1,400 rooms in each of them. TTD will also introduce the token system for allotment of cottages from July 12
 
 The rooms will be divided into two categories of tariffs ranging between Rs 50 and Rs 250 and Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. The pilgrims will have to register with their phone number and Aadhaar cards. They will receive an SMS if the allotment is confirmed and the pilgrim will be allotted room without waiting in queue lines for hours together. 
 
 As soon as the pilgrims get the message they will have to occupy rooma within half-an-hour paying the requisite amount. Otherwise, the accommodation will be done in the name of the next person in the series automatically.
 
 The EO clarified that TTD has come under GST with no effect on laddu prasadam but some services like sale of gold dollars, accommodation and kalyana mandapams will be covered.
 
 On the sale of gold dollars, he said there will be 3% GST. While the GST on room tariffs ranging between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,500 is 12%, it is 18% on those above Rs 2,500. GST will apply for   with rentals above Rs 10,000.
 
 "The additional outflow that TTD will incur on   will be around Rs 32 crore while it is Rs 1,900 crore on the pilgrim services front. But since the tariffs of around 86% of rooms will be below Rs 1,000, there will be no burden on the common pilgrims", he maintained.
 
 The EO said 25, 77,165 pilgrims had darshan of the Lord in June, 1.08 lakh more than the figure during the corresponding month in the previous year with a 4.4% increase. About 1.07 crore laddus were sold in June this year as against 94 lakhs in the analogous period last year. The hundi collections stood at Rs 86.56 crore in June this year as against 90 crore during the same month last year.
