After the filing application to the authorities for registering marriages, the officer concerned sends notice to the address of the couples for verification and their respective families came to know of their impending marriage. This creates complications for realizing the marriage. The petitioner said there is no such provision in the Special Marriages Act

Sub-section (2) of Section 6 requires the Marriage Officer to cause every such notice to be published by affixing a copy thereof at some conspicuous place in his office." Thus, the the court held that the procedure of affixing the notice at the residence of the parties is not warranted or authorised by law. It has been held that this would amount to a breach of privacy of the individuals.
