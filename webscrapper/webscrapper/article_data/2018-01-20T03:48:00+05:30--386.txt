Panaji: Hill cutting in a remote corner of Saligao village, being undertaken in alleged violation of the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act, 1974, has been stopped by the North Goa flying squad. The order was issued by deputy collector, incharge of North Goa flying squad, following complaints about illegal excavation on the slope of a hill near Western Club, Saligao, on the southern side of the Porvorim-Calangute road. Excavation was being carried out clandestinely. In the notice, the deputy collector has asked the persons concerned to explain as to why action should not be taken for restoration of the land, within three days from receipt of the order. The flying squad team inspected the site and submitted a report confirming that the hill was being cut in an area measuring about 40sqm.   “Prime facie it has been established that the activity is being done in violations of provisions of Section 17-A (prohibition on cutting of hilly land and filling up of low lying land, etc) of the TCP Act, 1974, and other regulations,” a TCP source said.
