NASHIK: The court of the district and sessions judge   on Thursday reserved its order on the quantum of punishment to six people convicted in the murder of three dalits at Sonai village in   district in 2013.

 “We will pronounce the sentence on January 20,” judge RR Vaishnav said.
 
 Three dalit youths, Sachin Gharu, Sandeep Thanwar and Rahul Kandare, were killed on January 1, 2013 and the court had on Tuesday convicted Popat Darandale, Ramesh Darandale, Prakash Darandale, Ganesh Darandale, Sandeep Kurhe and Ashok Navgire for the murder. 
 
 During the hearing special public prosecutor   pleaded for capital punishment for the convicts, stating that the victims were killed in a brutal manner. Moreover, the convicts did not show any repentance for the act at any point of time. 
 
 Appearing for the defence, lawyer Avinash Bhide pleaded for minimal sentence to the convicts and also urged to take into consideration the five years they have already spent behind the bars. 
 
 Thanwar, one of the victims, used to work at   in Ahmednagar where the daughter of Popat Darandale was pursing her BEd course. They had fallen in love. Since   was dalit and the girl was from higher caste, the relatives of the girl did not approve the same. 
 
 The trio’s killing came to light after one of the convicts informed police that a person had fallen in their septic tank.
