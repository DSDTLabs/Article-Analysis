Penny Junor, the Royal Biographer, is set to publish a book about all the dogs Queen   has owned in her lifetime, titled 
 .

 Coming out this November, the book will be "affectionate and informative" revealing "a side to the Queen that not many people know about", according to Hodder. 
 
 Hodder commissioning editor   bought the world rights from agent Jane Turnbull. 
 
 Junor already has to her credit biographies of Princes William and Harry, both the Prince and the Princess of Wales, and two British Prime Ministers. She also wrote The Duchess: The Untold Story, a biography of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (William Collins), which was publsiehd last year. 
 
 Maddy Price was quoted saying, "Penny is the perfect person to write this book, being the number-one expert on all things royal, and herself a passionate lover of dogs. This will be a fascinating and affectionate look at the queen and her corgis, packaged as the perfect gift for Christmas. I am very much looking forward to publishing 
 ."
 
 According to Junor, the Queen loves corgis and has had them by her side since she was seven years old. The author hopes the book would appeal to royalists and dog lovers alike.
 
 She added, "They announce the Queen’s arrival in any room, they have taken part in interviews, portraits and parties, and were even part of the James Bond spoof at the Olympic opening ceremony in 2012. I have hugely enjoyed researching this book, meeting fellow dog-lovers and getting to know corgis – a breed I had scarcely come across – and I hope my book will be a joy to dog lovers and royalists everywhere."
