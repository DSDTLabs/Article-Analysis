LUMBI: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patron and chief minister   is concentrating more on Lambi assembly constituency after   president Captain   announced his candidature from the seat. Since January 9, Badal has spent six days in the constituency and plans to stay put till Thursday. 

 Badal spent three consecutive days in his constituency last week, and is going to be here for fours days on the trot this week. He campaigned in Lambi on January 9, 10, and 11 last week, and has now been in the segment since January 16.
 
 During the previous elections, the Punjab CM used to spend two days at a stretch in the seat, while campaigning at other places in between. He used to devote more days in campaigning across Punjab. Lambi assembly has 72 villages. “Spending more days for campaigning at a stretch in Lambi shows that Badal is fearful of Amarinder’s entry. Earlier, he used to campaign across the length and breadth of Punjab for days before the announcement of the poll schedule. This time, he is concentrating more on Lambi,” said the Muktsar unit chief of Congress, Gurmeet Singh Khuddian. Lambi falls in Muktsar district. 
 
 On the other hand, Akali leaders denied any anxiety in Badal’s mind. “Badal ‘saab’ used to spend two days at a stretch and campaigning at other places. He used to reach at each and every village in Lambi. He will complete campaigning in Lambi on Thursday and then will concentrate on other areas of Punjab,” said SAD’s   (zone I) senior vice president, Ranjodh Singh Lambi.
