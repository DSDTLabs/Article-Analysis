Panaji: Although dogs and roosters continue to make their presence felt at Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, the garbage dump in front of Yatri Niwas has been cleared.

 The dump situated within the premises of GMC and close to the medicine ward was turning unhygienic with dogs and cattle seen rummaging through the garbage, which included biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. 
 
 Birds that have the potential to spreading a range of diseases would also feed on the waste. Scavenger birds would also circle the dump, posing a danger to patients at the hospital. The unsanitary sight was one unbecoming of the medical college frequented by thousands of patients on a daily basis.
 
 Rashmi Deshpande was shocked to see the dump which was in full view of the orthopedic ward where her grandmother was admitted for over two weeks. “I’m relieved that the dump is being cleared. No patients should have to bear with the unhygienic dump in the hospital,” she said.
 
 Last week, smoke from the huge heap of mixed waste was burned with the fumes spreading to the entire complex of GMC, including the medicine ward. 
 
 Health minister Vishwajit Rane issued directions on Tuesday morning to get the garbage cleared and paid a visit to check on the progress in the evening. The plastic waste was removed by Wednesday morning with a tractor flattening the mound of mud.
