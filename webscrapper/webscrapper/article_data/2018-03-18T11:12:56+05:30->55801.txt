TRICHY: Doctors of the neurology department of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in   on Saturday removed eight pellets from the spinal cord of a 20-year-old man who was injured after his country-made gun accidentally went off at   in Trichy on Friday. However, he was under observation for removal of 12 more pellets. 

 A team of doctors led by neurosurgeon   operated out the pellets from the spinal cord of B Santhosh of   near Uppiliyapuram. He had sustained severe wounds after several rounds of pellets pierced through his body as the gun accidentally discharged them while hunting for birds in his village. It was said that the incident occurred when he tried to climb a tree leaving the rifle leaning against it. 
 
 The doctors said that as many as 20 pellets got into his back, chest, abdomen and kidney. On getting injured, he was admitted to a private hospital in Trichy which allegedly demanded several lakhs of rupees for the treatment, following which he was shifted to MGMGH. The doctors found that he could not walk as pellets were lodged in his spinal cord. Hence they planned to remove them through surgery and performed it by morning. Though his health condition was stable, his full recovery would depend on the removal of 12 other pellets from the kidney, chest and abdomen.
