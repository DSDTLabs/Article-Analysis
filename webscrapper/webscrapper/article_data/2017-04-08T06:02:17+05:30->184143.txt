BHOPAL: Having surplus power,   is likely to sell electricity to the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in neighbouring  .

 Grappling with the problem of plenty that is adversely affecting the power costs, the state government recently signed a contract for selling 200 MW power to Tamil Nadu and is now close to selling same amount of power to Uttar Pradesh. It is for the first time that Madhya Pradesh has started selling power to other states. Power was only provided to other states on the basis of power banking so far. As per the official sources, the total power generation capacity of Madhya Pradesh, including power purchase agreements with the private producers, non-conventional power as well as thermal power, is around 17500 MW. However, the highest ever power demand in the state till now has been close to 11,500 MW, thus making the state power surplus all the time.
 
 As per the PPAs with the private producers, the state government had to pay them the fixed charges, which run into thousands of crores even if it could not purchase power due to low demand. Mainly, this factor, combined with high transmission losses, have pushed the per unit power cost to around Rs 6.50 in Madhya Pradesh, said sources.
 
 “We are going to sell power to Tamil Nadu at Rs 3.06 per unit, which is low, but will still add to the revenue of the company. We have also participated in bidding for supplying 200 MW power to Uttar Pradesh and are the lowest among the bidders there. It is likely that we will be getting the contract. The rates at which we will be selling power to Uttar Pradesh is better than the rate at which we are selling power to Tamil Nadu,” said an official, pleading anonymity.
 
 Besides sales, the Madhya Pradesh has also given 250 MW of power to Chhattisgarh and 15 MW of power to Maharashtra through power banking. These states will be returning the power to Madhya Pradesh in November with a premium of 5%, said sources.
