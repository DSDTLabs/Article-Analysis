TRICHY: The scrutiny over the functioning of distance education centres run by universities in the state has been increasing every passing day in the wake of the arrest and suspension of the   (BU) vice-chancellor A Ganapathi over the graft charges and registration of cases against four former staff at   for allegedly swindling Rs28 lakh in connection with a study centre set up at Kolkata.

 The second incident, particularly, draws focus on the universities that are running study centres outside the state and the country, especially after University Grants Commission’s (UGC) Distance Education Council (DEC) prohibiting universities running such centres outside territorial jurisdiction.
 
  (BDU) administration told TOI that they had completely shut down all their study centre franchisees outside the state two years back. Director of Centre for Distance Education (CDE) at BDU S Arumugam asserted, "We have zero study centres outside  ". He said that even a minimal number of students from outside the state, who had not completed their course, were asked to attend exams in the study centres in Chennai.
 
 On the other hand, Tamil Nadu Government Collegiate Teachers Association ( ) president T Veeramani alleged that corruption exists in all universities that run distance education. "It’s just that some people were caught recently, while others haven’t been yet," he said. He also urged the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( ) to keep a close eye on those who volunteer to bribe administration heads. "Both are equally corrupt. The education system can be cleansed only if the briber and the bribe taker are punished," Veeramani said.
 
 In the meantime, there were several reports that the DVAC officials visited BDU on Tuesday to interrogate a few people associated with the arrested VC of BU. But a senior official from DVAC refuted the rumours and stated that they paid a visit to the university for a different reason.
