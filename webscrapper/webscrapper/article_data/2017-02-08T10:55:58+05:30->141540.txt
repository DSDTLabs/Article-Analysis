KOCHI: Three more containers carrying second-hand photocopy machines have been allowed into container freight stations (CFS) at the International Container Transshipment Terminal in Vallarpadam on Monday raising alarms of potential   getting piled up in Kochi. 

 The   said the   arrived in Kochi between December and January.
 
 "Once the printers in these containers have been destuffed and it will be sized and added to the current pile of printers, which are being investigated by customs department," said B Umadevi, assistant commissioner customs. 
 
 "The cause for the delay could be any, either they were held back because of the ongoing investigation or because of logistical problems, which is more likely," said Umadevi. 
 
 A single container can carry up to 150 photocopy machines. Until December the customs seized more than 8,000 photocopy machines, which were brought to Kochi via 100 containers. 
 
 Last week, the high court quashed the plea made by few importers for the machines' release and asked the customs to complete investigation and adjudicate the imports within next three months.
 
 Customs sleuths said that the investigation from the department is almost complete and that they will notify of the state police and central pollution control board to the further investigate the matter. 
 
 "These imports have to be investigated on many other factors, such as the life span of these photocopy machines, as they extremely difficult to dispose of," he said. 
 
 The photocopy machines are being imported from several foreign countries including the United States, Canada, Germany and Dubai. He said most of these shipments come from the United States. 
 
 Umadevi said that the customs department will be issuing a show cause notice to the importers in coming days, as their investigation has revealed that importers were lacking the necessary documents required to the import the photocopy machines.
