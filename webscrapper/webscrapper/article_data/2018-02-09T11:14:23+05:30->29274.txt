KOZHIKODE : CPI (Maoist) has said that the developments at   in   district, where an agitation by the dalits is going on, have exposed the anti-Dalit upper caste face of 'fake' communists. 

 In a statement issued here, Jogi, the spokesperson of the Western Ghats special zonal committee of the Maoists, said that the dalits of Vadayambadi are on an agitation to reclaim public space. 
 
 "The government's claim that it is against caste system is hollow because it has not taken any steps to demolish the caste wall erected by the upper castes there," Jogi said. 
 
 "The CPI (Maoist) condemns the arrest of the social activists who came to attend the 'self-respect convention' at Vadayambadi on February 4. The  , which follows the policy of Brahminical soft Hindutwa, is helping the casteist forces," the statement said. 
 
  
  
 The Maoist leader said the Vadayambadi issue is a not an isolated one. "The police had refused permission to keep the body of the artist   on the premises of the office of the Kerala Lalitha Kala Akademy," he said.
 
 The statement exhorted the public to see through the hollowness of the CPM that often claims the legacy of the renaissance movement in Kerala. "The demolition of the caste wall as part of the agitation was a right move. Provoked by the incident, the police and the upper caste fascists are unleashing terror on the Dalits," Jogi said.
 
 The CPI (Maoist) called upon democratic forces to join hands to resist the atrocities against Dalits by fascist   forces and extend support to the Dalits to reclaim public space.
