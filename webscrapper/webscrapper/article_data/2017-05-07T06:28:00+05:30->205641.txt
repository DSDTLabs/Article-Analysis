NAGPUR: The small-sized venue at   was brimming with excitement as kids on their summer vacation filled the lazy hot Saturday afternoon with a play which at once intrigued, enthused and tickled them. ‘Manohar Mama’, a production of Stagecraft Theatre, was a short, cute and a vibrant presentation.

 Nitish Chandra, the young writer of the play, ensured that all matters that appeal to children are present in generous ounces. So Manohar Mama’s shy, whimsical and enthusiastic persona was at once amusing and endearing. His urge to smell a conspiracy, to cobble up the probable and solve the case in a jiffy fired his niece and nephew too, who happily played   to mama’s   act. 
 
 The two neighbours also provide the right measure of spice. The bubbly plot is essayed with matching effervescence by Amol Wakhare and Krutika Rangari as the niece and nephew. Radhika Joshi as Supriya Sengupta and Sonal Trivedi as Maya Deshpande add zest with their dialogues laced with Bengali and Marathi respectively. Aditya Bansod as Bhiku the flute playing gardener takes the story forward. Surrounded by a set of actors who played their part well is Vikash Khurana as Manohar Mama. He raises the bar with his act as an eccentric self-styled detective who deftly fends off overtures of a more than interested neighbour.
 
 The music adds to the charm of the play and the song ‘tick ghadi’, written by Sei Deshpande and composed by Rajat Ghodde, brings all cast on stage for a little jig.
