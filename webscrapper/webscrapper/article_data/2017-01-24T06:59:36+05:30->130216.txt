SURAT: The   (AAI) finalised the master plan for   with two parallel runways and submitted it to the   (SUDA) for its incorporation in its development plan 2035.

 AAI had signed an agreement with the state government in 2003 to develop and expand the Surat airport in next two years. But since the additional land required was not provided by the state government, the project was on hold.
 
 Now, the state government has decided to provide an additional 630.49 hectares land to AAI to further develop Surat airport. “Surat airport had received 317.43 hectares land by August 2009. As per earlier master plan passed in 2007, AAI had demanded 1,067.5 hectare land. The final master plan was further reviewed by AAI planning directorate in 2016 and revised master plan was submitted to SUDA for incorporation in their development plan-2035,” Surat airport director  .
 
 The revised master plan includes extension of runway from 2,905 meters to 3,810 meters to achieve an overall passenger handling capacity of maximum 25-30 million per annum. It also includes development of two parallel runways with simultaneous operations. 
 
 As per SUDA’s development plan, about 955.04 hectares is reserved for   that will meet the long term development of Surat Airport by providing second parallel runway of 3,810 meters long suitable larger aircrafts for simultaneous operations with CAT-I approaches at both ends of the runway.
 
 “The proposed functioning of two parallel runways with a minimum separation distance of 1,525 m will help achieve an overall passenger handling capacity of 55-60 million per annum approximately. Rectangular shape of land would be ideal for development of any airport master plan,” said Thakre. 
 
 Surat district collector M S Patel said, “Reservation of 62.23 hectare land as immediate requirement for single runway configuration has been confirmed by SUDA. The planning directorate AAI has also been intimidated about administration difficulties for reservation of part of the additional proposed land. Once frequency of flight increases at Surat airport more land will be acquired and provided to AAI for the development plan.”
