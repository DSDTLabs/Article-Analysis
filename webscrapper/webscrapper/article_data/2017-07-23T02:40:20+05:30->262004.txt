MUMBAI: As many as 5,915 seats remain vacant in various  , including IITs, NITs, IIITs and other centrally funded government institutes, even after the sixth round of admission.

 The seventh round of admissions is currently on.
 
 Surprisingly, a total of 26 seats were vacant in the most popular course — computer science and technology — across various IITs, especially at the newer IITs like Indore, Patna, Goa, Jammu, Dharwad and Jodhpur. Similar was the case with electrical   course with 56 unfilled spots.
 
 There were seats vacant even at top institutes like IIT-Bombay (one in civil engineering) and IIT-Delhi (two in the same course). Two seats in aerospace engineering remain vacant at the Powai campus.
 
 Surprisingly, of the ten seats available in IIT-Delhi, one was vacant in popular chemical engineering course.
 
 "There could be several reasons.... Some candidates prefer institute over stream and many others want to pursue stream of their choice,” said an admissions dean. “What is surprising is that most of these are in the open category, which means there are candidates, but they don’t want to join these courses.”
 
 At IIT-Madras, there were 20 seats available at the start of the seventh round. The largest vacancy was at IIT-Varanasi. At the end of the joint counselling last year, there were 73 vacancies in the IITs, bulk of them in IIT-Varanasi (38). In case of NITs (National Institutes of Technology), there are 1,518 vacancies.
 
 Most of the vacancies are part of state quota.
