Noida: For the next four weeks, brandishing your copy of The Times of India could help you  .

 Here’s how it will work. Bring your TOI, get spotted by the TOI team, answer a simple question and win prizes on the spot.
 
 The ‘Win with the Times’ campaign gets underway in Noida and Gurgaon from April 11 and will run on weekdays for the next four weeks. 
 
 But the campaign will be more than just about goodies. The campaign aims at increasing the citizens’ traffic awareness. To qualify for the prize, the car owner has to obey the rules of the road.
 
 The Win with the Times campaign will reward those motorists who obey traffic regulations. So, if you are jumping a red light or driving on the wrong side, brandishing your TOI won’t work.
 
 The campaign will be run at different points in Gurgaon and Noida from Tuesday.
 
 In Noida, you can look for the TOI team in the morning and evening at Rajnigandha intersection and the Noida exit gate in Sector 14. So, when you leave home, don’t forget to carry your TOI and remember to follow traffic rules.
 
 It might turn out to be your lucky day.
