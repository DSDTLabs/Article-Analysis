AHMEDABAD: Soon after the alleged fraud involving jeweller  , the demand for diamonds has taken a major hit, over purity concerns, highlights a study conducted by   and Industry of India ( ). The demand for diamond jewellery has declined by 10-15% over the past two months. The study highlights that since majority of the diamond trade is in the unorganized market, the consumers’ faith in the high-value purchases has taken a hit.

 “Well-known branded jewellery makers issue certificates of purity. However, majority of the trade is in the unorganized market, based on mutual faith between consumers and jewellers. This has been shaken and the consumers are not willing to take chances following a massive adverse publicity about the sector,” mentions the study.
 
 The survey also suggest that 65% of jewellers are also moving towards traditional pure gold and silver ornaments over diamond jewellery, over a shaken consumer confidence in diamond jewellery purchases. 
 
 The survey also highlights that most jewellers said there is an increase in the number enquiries from customers for getting their pre-purchased jewellery re-checked for quality and authenticity of gold and diamonds. The recent incident has created a fear among customers who are enquiring about the quality of jewellery especially diamonds.
