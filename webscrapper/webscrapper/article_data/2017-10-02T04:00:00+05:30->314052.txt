Vadodara: Acting on a tip-off, the local crime branch (LCB) and special operations group (SOG) seized a huge stock of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) on Godhra-Lunawada highway late on Saturday night. 

 The LCB and SOG sleuths had put up a watch at Chhabanpur Chowkdi and tried to intercept the truck they were informed about. However, the truck driver Rajpal Singh Tomar started speeding away seeing the cops. After chasing him for some distance, the police nabbed him and found 1,244 cartons of liquor bottles total worth Rs 69.21 lakh stashed in the vehicle. 
 
 Interestingly, the liquor consignment was to be delivered in Rajasthan and not Gujarat. During interrogation, Tomar admitted that the alcohol was manufactured in Chandigarh and it was to be supplied in Rajasthan. However, cops did not believe him initially. But, when they found toll booth tickets from him, they realized that he had taken a longer route to avoid being caught on Punjab-Rajasthan border. 
 
 “Before entering Gujarat, Tomar travelled through Agra, Jhansi, Nagpur, Bhiwandi and then to Madhya Pradesh,” said Dharmendrasinh Chavada, police inspector, LCB.
 
 He added that the liquor stock was meant for sale in Punjab only but it was being taken to Rajasthan. Tomar also told the police that he had got the loaded truck from a person identified as Ravi Babu at a highway side hotel on the outskirts of Chandigarh.
 
 A complaint was registered against Tomar, Babu and unidentified person who was to take the delivery of the liquor stock.
