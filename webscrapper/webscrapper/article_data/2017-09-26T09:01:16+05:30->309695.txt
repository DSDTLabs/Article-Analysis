ITANAGAR: The body of a student missing after a group clash on September 16 was found at   near   (JNV) campus in Tawang district on Sunday, police said. 

 The body was found a day after the accused in the case were granted bail.
 
 Toko Yame, a 16-year-old Class XII student of Tawang's Government Higher Secondary School, went missing after students of the school clashed with those at JNV. SP (Tawang) G Dajangju said, "We are sending the body to Itanagar as the district hospital does not have any facility," he added.
 
 Suspecting foul play, Toko's father   said, "The manner in which my son's body was found clearly shows that it was a planned murder. How come the body appeared all of a sudden at the place where the police claimed to have searched several times? My son's body had several cut marks," Yame said, demanding a   probe into the death. He also sought the governor's intervention and appealed to police to investigate without bias.
 
 The East Kameng Social Welfare and Cultural Organisation and All East Kameng District Students' Union, too, demanded a thorough probe.
