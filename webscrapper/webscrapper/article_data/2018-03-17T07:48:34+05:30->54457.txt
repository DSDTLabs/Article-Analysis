PANAJI: Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital estimates the number of brain deaths a year to be 150. Dr Ponraj  , professor and head of the neurosurgery department at GMC, was asked to give the number of possible brain deaths at   alone while speaking at a transplant coordination induction training programme on Thursday.

 
  
 
 Despite a high number of road accident deaths, with one death every day, GMC has not declared a single brain death till date. Sundaram told TOI that the priority of doctors should be saving lives and preventing injuries.
 
 The issue of brain deaths has come to the fore with growing emphasis on cadaveric transplants vis-à-vis seeking living donors. The training programme also saw questions raised about why there is a reluctance on the part of neurosurgeons to take initiatives in declaring brain deaths.
 
 One of the participants said the trend was witnessed across the country. One of the speakers said with doctors being on their toes 24x7 it’s not surprising that medical practitioners’ focus remains on patients alone.
 
 Sundaram said that the only thing required is the will to declare brain deaths. Pointing out the limitations, he said that the 1,500-bed GMC hospital has barely 20 ICU beds. At least two dedicated ICU beds would be required in the event that GMC wants to start declaring brain deaths in the near future. Recently, the GMC got approval from the   (NOTTO) for cadaveric retrieval. The whole set-up is likely to be ready for cadaveric retrieval in a year.
