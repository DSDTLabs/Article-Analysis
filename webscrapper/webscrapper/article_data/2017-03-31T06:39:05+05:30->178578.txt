LUCKNOW: Those accused of crime but pleading to be tried as juvenile will soon be in a tough spot as King George’s Medical University’s   joining hands with an Italian expert to improve accuracy of age estimation. KGMU will also collaborate with a Bosnian expert to identify gender of a deceased through the 3D dental point verification software of the lower jaw which will be useful in a mass casualty situation in future.

 Organising its third foundation day and holding its first international conference on forensic odontology, KGMU’s dedicated unit shared the plans on Thursday. Putting Italian dental expert Dr Roberto Cameriere’s study of Europe in the Indian context, the department will be determining more accurate biological age versus chronological age. “So far, accuracy is between 87-90%,” said prof Shalini Gupta, organising secretary of the conference, adding, “The age range we are able to tell is between six months to one year of the actual biological age. With Dr Cameriere’s formula, however, we can improve this further.” 
 
 KGMU needs to expand database by including convicts and jail inmates in the study. “We also plan to propose to the government to include dental impressions for Aadhar cards along with iris identification and finger prints, so that in case of a casualty, we have a data bank in place,” added Gupta. 
 
 Prof Adarsh Kumar of AIIMS Delhi's forensic medicine department said, “We will collaborate on aspects other than dental and and estimate biological age through wrist, skull, vertebra and knee as well.”
 
 For mass disaster situations, in which all that remains of a body is hard material such as teeth, KGMU will join hands with Dr Selma Zukic of the University of Sarajevo to benefit from her 3D point software to determine gender.
