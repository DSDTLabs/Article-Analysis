MHOW: The residents of   had been running pillar to post to get the road to their village constructed but didn't get the response from any authority for the last two decades. It's then the villagers got united and decided to get it constructed on their own. They collected money in December and started the work.

  Patel, a resident of the village told TOI that the 1.5 km stretch of   was in such a position that the level of the agricultural farms on both sides was lower than that of the farms. Due to this, the road used to be water logged during at least eight months every year. This was a very big problem for the residents, due to which the villagers had been approaching the authorities and public representatives of the area for   after raising its level. It was the scene since last twenty years when they realised that nobody was ready to listen to their problem. So, they got it done themselves.
 
 When they decided to make the road themselves, all of them got ready for fund collection. Rs 50,000 were deposited till December last year and when the collection rose to Rs 2.5 lakh, they started the work in February.
 
 They got the work completed last week but when Depalpur MLA Manoj Patel came to know about it, he reached the village and assured them of getting the road bitumenised on government's cost as early as possible.
