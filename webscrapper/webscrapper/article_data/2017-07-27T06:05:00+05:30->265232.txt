Nagpur: A highly qualified jobless man committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan of his rented house in front of Thote College on Narsala road on Tuesday.

 Relatives of the deceased, Rahul Kamble (26), claimed that he suffered from depression after taking a wrong decision in choosing his career path and wasting a substantial amount of his widowed mother, an employee of a private company.
 
 It is learnt that Rahul’s elder brother is addicted to alcohol and not able to raise a family of three with his low income.
 
 The Hudkeshwar police have registered a case of accidental death, following a complaint by Shakuntala (49), the deceased’s mother. Police said after graduation, Rahul completed his masters in hotel management and recently started preparing for MPSC exam as he was looking for a stable future in government sector.
 
 Relatives said that Rahul always wanted to provide financial assistance to Shakuntala, but the guilt of being jobless compelled him take the extreme step.
 
 Police said Rahul hanged himself when nobody was at home. Shakuntala later saw him hanging and was shocked. Cops later sent his body to GMCH for post mortem, which was held on Wednesday.
