Chennai: The University Grants Commission ( ), in a circular issued last month, has directed all universities to upload data regarding PhDs on their websites within two months.

 Universities will have to provide details of the department, name of supervisor, the mode of PhD (part-time or full-time) along with the topic and likely date of completion. All these details would have to be verified by the university authorities and made public. The UGC will maintain a list of defaulting universities who fail to undertake this exercise, the circular stated.
 
 University professors in Tamil Nadu are upbeat about the regulation. “This will help in diversification of research topics across universities. For instance, a candidate doing a PhD in Chennai can check if the same topic is being researched by someone in Madurai,” said Professor SS Sundaram, head of the department of Indian history at the University of Madras.
 
 Currently, none of the state universities have details of research output on their websites. The finished thesis should also be uploaded so that duplication or plagiarism charges can be contested, a senior professor said.
 
 This would improve transparency as doling out PhDs has become some sort of an industry in Tamil Nadu’s state universities, another professor from the University of Madras added. “ People who are well connected seem to get a PhD very easily. Uploading these details would make the process transparent,” the professor said.
