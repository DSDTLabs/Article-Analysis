 The students first had discussion with additional chief secretary (health)   in which the government insisted on two-year bonded service which the students did not accept. The students later met health minister  . In the talks with the minister also no consensus formula was evolved.
 
 “We are ready to join the government service but not as bonded service. Give us permanent placements in the government service,” said Dr P Jathin, state president of KMPGA .
