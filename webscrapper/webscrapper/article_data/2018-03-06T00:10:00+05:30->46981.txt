 Chandigarh: All-rounder   is of the view that Kings XI Punjab’s decision to choose Ravichandran Ashwin as the team’s captain for the upcoming Indian Premiere League ( ) is a smart move. But he also opined that Ashwin should be given a long run as a leader at least for three years.
 
 Pathan who went unsold in the IPL auction, told TOI that the team’s inconsistency should be attributed to its constant experiments with the man at the helm. “I think they should give Ashwin at least three years as a captain. They have changed captains regularly, but this time they have chosen the right man for the job. He is a very smart player and his experience of playing under MS (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) would help him achieve success as a leader,” the Vadodra lad said on the sidelines of a TV event on Monday in Chandigarh.
 
 Pathan, who has donned the Kings XI colours in the past, believes Kings XI look to be a good side on papers. “The team is looking good with the likes of Chris Gayle, Yuvraj Singh, KL Rahul, Aaron Finch, in-form Mayank Agarwal and Mujeeb Zadran, the young spinner from Afghanistan in the side. They have a solid squad,” said Pathan.
 
 The 33-year-old is of the opinion that this IPL would be an acid test for youngsters like Prithvi Shaw, Shubman Gill, Manjot Kalra and Kamlesh Nagarkoti, who all were part of the U-19 World Cup winning side. “Look I believe the transition process is a very important phase in a cricketer’s life and if they remain focused, they would succeed.
 
 From the last U-19 World Cup winning team in 2012, only one player (Sandeep Sharma) has represented India. “But the current players have none other than Rahul Dravid as their mentor, who for me has the best cricketing mind,” said Pathan.
