Vadodara: With polls around the corner, chief minister Vijay Rupani did not miss a chance to hit out at the Congress at the function organised to mark the centenary of the Manasankalp Divas â€“ the day on which Dr B R Ambedkar vowed in Vadodara to fight for equality.

 Addressing a public meeting on Ajwa Road Rupani said that the Congress has done several injustices to Ambedkar like defeating him in the parliamentary elections, taking away a ministry from him, not awarding him Bharat Ratna and others. Rupani said that the Congress had ignored national heroes other than those from the Nehru-Gandhi family. Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rupani said that it was Modi who was trying to change this.
 
 Rupani said that the state government was working for the welfare of poor, downtrodden, exploited and the deprived. He pointed out that Rs 1,032 crore had been earmarked by the government for their welfare.
 
 CM mentioned the Una flogging incident too stating that attempts were being made to defame the state government through it. He said that the culprits of the incident were behind the bars and action that would set an example for the country was being taken against them.
 
 Rupani said that the government will not leave any stone unturned for expenses for the Dr Babesaheb Ambedkar Sankalpbhoomi Smarak that is coming up in the city. He said that the monument will be unparalleled and would become an attraction for tourists. Rupani laid the foundation stone of the monument on Saturday. Rupani said that a temple, convention centre, art gallery and museum will come up on the site.
 
 Ambedkar who had faced discrimination despite being a high-ranking official and having the patronage of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in the erstwhile Baroda state had resolved to fight for equality under a tree in Kamatibaug. The government has planned an elaborate memorial at Kalyannagar near the garden.
