When a compliment comes from a proficient actor as  , then the Malayali audience is quite sure that the thing in question might really be worth mentioning. In a video posted on social media, he says when people ask him about his favourite script and film, he always says that whatever the audience has embraced would be his pick too. 

 He adds the recently released film   has been garnering praises from all over, and he come across compliments from people, who have already seen the film. Some of them were effusive about how the last half an hour of the movie was so much interesting that they couldnâ€™t resist themselves from giving a standing ovation.
