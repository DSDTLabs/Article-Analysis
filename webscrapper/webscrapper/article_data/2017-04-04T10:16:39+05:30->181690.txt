HYDERABAD: The   on Monday reserved its orders on whether it can entertain a petition that was questioning the inaction of the   in filling up the posts of Chief Justice and scores of posts of judges in Hyderabad High Court. 

 The petition was filed by senior counsel   who was urging the court to ensure that the authorities at Delhi hasten up the process of filling vacant posts. 
 
 He also described as unconstitutional the approach of the authorities in running the Hyderabad HC with an acting CJ for the last 22 months. The bench of Justice V Ramasubramanian and   Uma Devi which heard the petitioner, the Centre and the high court counsel for a considerable length of time, said it would examine the maintainability of the plea and reserved its orders.
 
 Hyderabad High Court has a sanctioned strength of 61 judges. However it is running with just 27 judges now. From July 2015 onwards, ever-since Justice   retired as CJ of the Hyderabad HC, this court is run with an acting CJ. The petitioner's grievance is that this is affecting the appointment of judges also. More over, the number of judges from Telangana is only a mere four. 
 
 The centre on its part is saying that the ball is in Supreme Court and that it is not delaying any process.
