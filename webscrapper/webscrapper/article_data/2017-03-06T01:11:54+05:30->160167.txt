NEW DELHI: The   has urged the Delhi high court to dismiss a   against surcharge on credit/debit card transactions.

 It has argued that the tool of Public interest litigation (PIL) cannot be used as a “weapon to challenge financial or economic decisions”, while opposing the plea. The PIL has challenged the surcharge levied by the banks and the financial institutions on   saying it is “illegal” and “discriminatory” and wants the court to intervene.
 
 “The decisions are taken by the RBI in exercise of its administrative/ statutory powers and in public interest. The issues in the writ petition pertain purely to the economic policy of the state and the challenge to the same at the instance of a public-spirited person cannot fall within the parameters of PIL, as has been laid down by the   from time to time,” the RBI submitted before a bench comprising Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal.
 
 The HC was hearing a PIL filed alleging that though governments demonetisation move was beneficial, the decision to levy surcharge on credit and debit card transactions is “unlawful, unequal and arbitrary treatment is visible in the payment of petrol charges through credit and debit cards”. The PIL argues that levying surcharge is not only illegal and discriminatory but it also promotes circulation of black money.
 
 The RBI, however, refuted the petitioner’s contention and said that its decision is within rules and doesn’t violate any fundamental right or any legal right of the petitioner.
