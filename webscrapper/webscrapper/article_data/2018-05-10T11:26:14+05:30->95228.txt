BENGALURU: Bribing citizens into voting for a particular candidate is one of the oldest tricks in the book that has been in vogue for decades now. But enticing voters not to vote is a trend that is fast catching up in the state, if the seizure of   at a flat in   in Bengaluru on Tuesday afternoon is any indication.

 This is how the racket works: candidates bribe registered voters, who they believe would not vote for them for ideological reasons, in exchange of their elector photo identity cards (EPIC). The price of EPIC cards varies. If it just Rs 100 in a Lambani tanda (cluster) in a remote assembly segment of North  , it would be up to Rs 2,000 for slum-dwellers in Bengaluru.
 
 In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Kumar Bangarappa contesting from Shivamogga had alleged that BJP was purchasing EPIC cards at Rs 500 from Muslims and Lambanis in Congress-dominated areas.
 
 “I was approached by supporters of a BJP candidate who asked me if I wanted to get Rs 1,000 for not voting,’’ Arbaz Khan (name changed), a carpenter in Hebbal, said. “Some others in my colony got whiskey and cash,” he said.
 
 State election officials, however, said it’s not easy to steal a vote. “We have provisions under Section 135 of the  , 1951, that deal with rigging polls,” said Manoj R Rajan, special commissioner, elections (BBMP).
