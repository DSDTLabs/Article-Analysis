THRISSUR: The strike by various student unions at the Mother Arts and Science College, Peruvallur, near Pavaratty, ended on Friday as the management replaced principal-in-charge   over complaints by the students.

 The KSU had launched the strike on February 10 protesting against the 'unreasonable' restrictions put in place by the college authorities, including installation of   cameras in hostel building. Later, the SFI, the MSF and the AISF joined the strike seeking action against the principal-in-charge.
 
 “We received complaints from the students alleging that the principal imposed Rs 5,000 as fine for using mobiles on the campus. In addition, those who stay in the hostel also complained about CCTV cameras and the poor quality of food,“ said KSU leader C Silpa. The agitating students had put forward three demands: Removal of CCTV cameras that violate the privacy of girl students, action against the principal-incharge and well-laid regulations on using mobile phones.
 
 “In the discussions held on Thursday in the presence of police officials, management and PTA representatives, it was decided to form a committee to inspect the CCTV cameras installed in the hostel after which the unwanted ones will be removed,“ said SI Lalkumar.
 
 He added that use of mobiles phones by students has been restricted from 9.30am to 3.30pm on the college campus, violation of which will invite a fine of Rs 1,000.
 
 “The police had registered a case on the allegations against the principal-incharge. Though the strike has ended formally, further steps in the case will be monitored,“ said  , SFI district president.
 
 Meanwhile, the management issued a statement replacing the principal-incharge till further instructions and appointed viceprincipal Mini C V in his post.
