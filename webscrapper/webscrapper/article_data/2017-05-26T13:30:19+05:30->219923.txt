CHANDIGARH: The   of Chandigarh for the first time in its history will hire a Nagpur-based consultancy firm to plug holes in its water supply system and reduce wastage. 

 According to data available with the civic body, around 26% of the water is going down the drain without generating any revenue. 
 
 Considering the huge loss, the municipal corporation has engaged DRA Consultancy Ltd, which has been involved in urban infrastructure projects and amenities, to conduct a detailed survey and advise on how to cut the quantity of non-revenue generating water. 
 
 The project, costing around Rs 80 lakh, will be funded by the  .
 
 There are several reasons for the civic body not getting any revenue from certain quantity of water. In some colonies and villages, the corporation has been supplying water free of cost. 
 
 Leakage in the pipelines is also adding to the wastage. 
 
 Besides, there are several stand posts in markets and commercial areas where people waste drinking water. No revenue is generated from this stand posts.
 
 "The company will complete the survey work within two months and advise the civic body on how to stop the wastage, streamline the water distribution and generate income from the supplied water. We are better placed as compared to other states in terms of non-revenue water as several states have over 50% non-revenue water. Around 10-15 % water not generating any revenue is considered an ideal situation and the civic body is trying to reach that level," said a senior officer of MC.
 
 The World Bank had suggested that if the civic body submits a proposal with the consultancy firm's approval before May 30, it would fund the project, the officer said.
