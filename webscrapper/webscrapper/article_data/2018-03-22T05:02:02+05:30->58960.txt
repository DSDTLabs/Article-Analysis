NEW DELHI:   rubbished law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s allegations linking it to controversial data firm  , announcing that neither the party nor its chief   have ever hired the entity and instead levelled allegations that CA had been associated with BJP in the past. 

 
 The party alleged online profiles of CA reveal the company played a key role in BJP’s campaign in four states, including Bihar elections in 2010 and in its “272+” campaign. AICC distributed copies of the web profile of CA and its India partner Ovelina Business Intelligence (OBI). Reacting to Prasad’s allegations that CA could be part of the Congress campaign in 2019, AICC spokesman Randeep   said, “BJP’s factory of fake news has produced one more fake product today. It appears that fake press conferences, fake agendas, fake spins and fake statements have become the everyday character of BJP and its ‘lawless’ minister of law  .” 
 
 He said neither Congress nor Rahul had ever taken the services of the said company. Surjewala said it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has been seen in the company of Facebook chairperson Mark Zuckerberg. Surjewala said CA’s local partner OBI openly states it achieved “target 272+” for BJP and provided constituency-wise database to its candidates and extended support in national elections and state elections of Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi. Prasad cited media reports to claim Congress planned to engage the UKbased firm’s services for next Lok Sabha elections and to boost its president Rahul Gandhi's profile and asked him to explain the company's role in his social media outreach
