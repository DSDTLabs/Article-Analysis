LUCKNOW: BJP’s loss in  , the third in a row after losing Gorakhpur and Phulpur LS seats, coupled with the defeat in the   assembly seat, is likely to weaken CM Yogi Adityanath’s position within   and outside.

 
 When questions were raised over Yogi’s leadership and governance after BJP’s defeat in his stronghold Gorakhpur two months ago, the CM had blamed it on “overconfidence” of party workers. However, this time, BJP’s debacle continued despite Yogi holding four rallies in Kairana. He even held a rally in Noorpur.
 
  
  
 
 One of UP BJP’s general secretaries said non-payment of cane dues had angered west UP farmers and Yogi “failed to smell the rebellion brewing among them”.
 
  
  
  
 
 Thursday’s losses came despite Yogi's aggressive outreach through Gram Swaraj Yojana, envisaging on-the-spot implementation of various central schemes. 
 
 Observers also feel Yogi lacks connect with ministers and the 325 MLAs of the ruling coalition. Besides, a number of MLAs and ministers have levelled allegations of corruption and inaction against his administration. 
 
 Experts say the Kairana and Noorpur defeats would also arm the opposition to question Yogi as BJP’s pan-India star campaigner.
