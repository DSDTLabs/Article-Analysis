Noida: Chief secretary   on Monday directed the Noida Authority to completely mechanise the cleaning of city streets. He also asked Alok Tandon, CEO, Noida Authority, to have a proper system in place within the next two months for garbage disposal and segregation of solid municipal waste.

 Kumar said that for the first time in the state, truck-mounted equipment was being used to clean the main arterial streets of Noida.
 
  “We have decided that all main   of Noida will be mechanically cleaned and swept. Also, modern street furniture will be placed along these streets to make them model roads,” he said.
 
 Currently, Noida generates a whopping 600 tonnes of municipal waste every day. Nearly 1,600 health department workers strive to keep the city clean. 
 
 With the help of individual RWAs, Noida Authority has put in place mechanisms to deal with the garbage generated by hiring garbage collectors on contractors, who collect and dispose it in a disorganised manner, leaving the city littered and in a mess.
 
 Kumar asked Prabhat Kumar, divisional commissioner, to expedite submission of a report for recommendations to set up a dedicated municipal body in Noida. The commissioner had heard the public regarding the setting up of a body in December last year after district magistrate’s proposal for a municipal body.
 
 The chief secretary also said that an 11-km long irrigation drain, which flows through the city, will be cleaned without any further delays. “We have received lots of complaints regarding this drain. Noida Authority has already started cleaning it. I have been assured that by June 2018, all these municipal functions will be redressed including removal of encroachment. “Residents of the city will see the difference,” he said.
