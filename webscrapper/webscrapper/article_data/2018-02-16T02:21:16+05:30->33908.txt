NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish   on Thursday   lieutenant governor Anil   for   the   issue with him during a  . The LG’s office, however, claimed in an official statement that he was committed to quality education in Delhi and the recruitment process would move ahead as soon as possible.

 Sisodia, in a letter written after the meeting, expressed his displeasure over the lack of breakthrough on the issue. “When I came to you today (on Thursday) to discuss the matter, I was deeply disturbed to find that you were not willing to even discuss the issue,” he wrote. “You said to me that the decision on this issue is your prerogative and you were firm on the stand that there was no scope for discussion.” 
 
 Sisodia argued that while the service matter might be under the purview of the LG, education was under the elected government; but the   was “not even ready to engage with me on such a crucial issue”. 
 
 However, the LG’s office said that while the benefit of age relaxation had already been given to the experienced guest teachers sitting for the recruitment exam, weightage in marks could not be given legally. “The deputy CM was informed that the matter has been examined in detail and after an elaborate legal consultation, it was the considered view that granting of weightage in marks to a category of candidates is violative of the constitutional rights under Articles 14 and 16.” 
 
 Sisodia argued that between a new qualified recruit and an equally qualified guest teacher with the experience of teaching in a Delhi government school, it would make sense to choose the latter. 
 
 But the LG’s office maintained that age relaxation had already been granted to the guest teachers to appear for the recruitment examination. “It is extremely important that the process, now started to fill vacant posts of teachers, is completed expeditiously,” the statement said.
