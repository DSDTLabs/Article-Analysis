AHMEDABAD: Pilgrims who set off on foot from Jamalpur for the   shrine in   village near   on Friday morning had a tough time crossing the city, as they had to walk past the Pirana garbage dumps. 

 The fervour of the pilgrims, who embarked in their thousands on their 100-km walk to Bhadiad, could not be bogged down so easily, but they had to face a kilometre-long stretch full of dust and noxious smoke from the smouldering garbage heaps of Mt Pirana. Some were seen using handkerchiefs and dupattas to cover their faces to avoid the hellish experience. Yet, few complained about the difficulty on this dirty stretch.
 
 The pilgrims, however, had only one complaint, the unavailability of drinking water on the stretch. They could get water only at the crossroads on the   highway, where the dumping ground ends. "The area is so dirty and unsafe that it is impossible to have a water hut here," said Irfan Memon who managed one water hut on the highway. In the scorching heat at noon time, the pilgrims were constrained by having to stop at the first water hut they came across.
 
  from Chhatral said, "This is the only stretch where even water is not available." He goes on this pilgrimage every year and knows drinking water is available at short distances, with locals setting up water huts and refreshment centres along the route.
