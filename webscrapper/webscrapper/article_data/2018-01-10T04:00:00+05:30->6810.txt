Surat: A number of non govermental organisations (NGOs) have started helpline numbers to provide immediate treatment to birds injured by kite manja. The state government, too, along with local administration has made its Karuna programme for injured birds operational. There are around 14 NGOs in the city that work to rescue birds injured by manja during this time of the year. 

 Two GVK EMRI ambulances would be dedicated to rescuing and transporting injured birds in Surat. Last year, 1,375 birds were rescued and treated in the city during and after Uttarayan festival. District forest officer, social forestry, Surat, Punit Nayyar said, “Karuna is a consolidated effort of forest department, SMC, fire & emergency services, animal husbandry department and others. It will also do coordination with 14 NGOs and their 1,400 volunteers to ensure injured birds get treatment.” 
 
 A campaign was undertaken by the forest department in schools wherein students took pledge not to fly kites with Chinese and synthetic manja. “Many organizations and people are unaware about the ban on Chinese and synthetic manja. We undertook the campaign to make people aware about this menace,” Nayyar said. 
 
 Minister of tribal development Ganpatbhai Vasava visited different departments in the city on Tuesday and held a review meeting on Karuna programme. 
 
 NGOs have already started receiving several calls regarding injured birds. Prayas member Darshan Nayak said, “Since last week, we have been receiving at least 10 calls of injured birds. Majority of the birds injured by manja are pigeons and owls and there are some egrets too.”
