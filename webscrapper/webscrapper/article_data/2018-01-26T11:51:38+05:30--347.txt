VADODARA: A team of crime branch of Ahmedabad on Thursday recorded statement of former senate and syndicate member of MS University (MSU) Deepak Shah after it came to light that now arrested Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer had recced Shah before Ahmedabad serial blasts in July 2008.

 They visited Shah at his office near   on Thursday afternoon. While the cops from Ahmedabad could not be contacted, local police claimed to be unaware of the development. However, Shah confirmed that his formal statement was recorded by the police.
 
 “The cops asked me why did Tauqeer recce me and whether any major incident had taken place at the time when he was following me,” said Shah, adding, “I told them that I have no idea why he recced me, in fact I learnt couple of days back through media that he had been following me.”
 
 Shah told the cops about some of the possibilities why Tauqeer would have followed him. “It could be because of three reasons. Firstly, because I was part of the Ekta Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir in 1992 led by then BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi along with  ,” said Shah. “Secondly it could be because I was very active after 2002 Godhra carnage as member of   and president of   in Vadodara and lastly it could be because of my statements as senate and syndicate member of MSU following the 2007 fine arts issue.”
 
 Shah also said that it had come as a surprise to him as well that a terrorist would recce him.
