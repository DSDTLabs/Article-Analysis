JAIPUR: The   (SWC) formally launched Indian Army’s 2018 theme—Year of War Disabled Soldiers-2018—in the city on Friday. The SWC will reach out to over 5,000 soldiers who have either one or more disability in its command area.

 Lt General Cherish Mathson informed the media that they would hold a series of activities on the theme throughout the year.
 
 “Most of our ‘divyang’ members are not aware of their benefits and entitlements. The mission is to provide them all possible assistance and bring them to the mainstream. The foremost step in this regard would be to make all our stations divyang-friendly. Building ramps and other facilities are already progressing at our buildings,” said Mathson.
 
 Mathson said that there were over 5,000 such soldiers, including 2,000 in  . The SWC’s area of responsibility starts from Ranjitsinh Pura in the Jaisalmer-Bikaner sector to   in Punjab. Elaborating the plan, Mathson said that ‘satat milaap’ teams would create a database of divyangs. “These teams will contact each and every beneficiary personally and hear their grievance. They will act as a bridge between agencies and resolve their grievances. The idea is to help the disabled at their doorstep,” said Mathson.
 
 The   already has a recruitment policy in place for the differently-abled. However, more emphasis needs to be laid for providing job opportunities to disabled soldiers within the Army establishment, he added.
