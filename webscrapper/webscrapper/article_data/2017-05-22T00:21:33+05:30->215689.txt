Tuticorin:   on Sunday booked a warden of   and his younger brother on the charge of malpractice in a competitive exam held for selection of Grade II policemen, fire and rescue personnel and prison warden. 

 The accused were identified as Raja, 25, a resident of Ramachandrapuram in  , and his younger brother Murugan, 21. Police sources said the siblings had planned meticulously so that Murugan could crack the exam with the help of his brother. While the examination, held to recruit for various jobs throughout the state, was held at various centres through out the state, the brothers applied in such a way that both of them got seats in the same examination hall. 
 
 Police said Raja and Murugan sat next to each other in the examination hall at a private polytechnic college in Mullakadu. The exam started at 10am and got over at 11.20am. Police said Raja had applied for the exam without notifying in the application that he was already employed with the government. After filling the details in the answer sheet, he exchanged his answer sheet with his brother and filled answers on his behalf. 
 
 The supervisors in the hall sensed something amiss and snatched the papers. They discovered the malpractice and questioned the duo. They later handed over the two to the local police. 
 
  Muthaiyapuram police which arrested them later released the duo on bail. Tuticorin superintendent of police Ashwin Kotnis said that the offence comes under bailable sections.
