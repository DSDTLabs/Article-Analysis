THANE: The Kalyan sessions court has rejected the anticipatory bail application of BJP corporator  , who has been accused of announcing a contract to eliminate another BJP corporator,  . 

 Investigation officer,   pointed out the criminal antecedents of Mahesh and said that there were over 15 cases of serious offences registered against him. The officer also added that if Mahesh was granted bail, it could be easier for him to tamper with the witnesses not just in this case but also the previous ones he is accused of being involved in. 
 
 Kothmire said that the case was serious in nature and that the other accused arrested had deadly firearms, which did not belong to Mahesh. “In fact, after their henchmen were arrested, Mahesh and his aides had posted several objectionable posts on social media openly threatening to eliminate the opponents. Under such circumstances they should not be given an anticipatory bail,” he pointed out. 
 
 After hearing both the sides, the judge rejected the anticipatory bail plea paving way for the arrest of Mahesh, said Kothmire. Mahesh and Kunal, both from Dombivli, have been locked in a bitter battle since the past couple of years for an alleged one-upmanship triggering a war-like situation which even lead to murders on either sides. It is also learnt that both the parties were involved in scuffles at the Kalyan-   Municipal Corporation general body meetings. 
 
 Interestingly, Kunal was arrested for allegedly awarding a Rs 1 crore contract to kill Mahesh a few years ago.
