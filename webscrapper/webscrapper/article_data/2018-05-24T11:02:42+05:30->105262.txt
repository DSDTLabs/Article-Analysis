AMRITSAR: BJP Punjab chief   has asked chief minister   to direct the police not to harass farmers by summoning them to police stations if they were defaulting on loan payments, and instead direct the force to check their exploitation by micro-financial institutions (MFIs) and self-financing groups (SFGs).

 Malik here on Wednesday that Punjab was an agrarian economy and farmers were its backbone. “To increase yield, farmers depend on agrarian credit and miscellaneous loans in the wake of high input costs. At times, due to varied reasons, including crop failure, non-remunerative prices, or any other natural calamity, farmers suffers losses and are unable to repay loans,” he said. “In such cases, recovery agents often pressure farmers. They are also called to police stations and humiliated.”
 
 He said farmers ended up approaching MGIs and SFGs to repay bank loans and get caught in the debt trap. “They are charged hefty interest rates up, up to 30% and more per annum at times. This is a gross violation of instructions of RBI, so there is an immediate need to check exploitation of farmers at hands of these financial institutions,” said Malik.
 
 He said there had been an 118% rise in cases of farm suicide in Punjab. “The farming community has made immense contributions to India’s development and is proud of it. Today, they are in distress and need to be bailed out; they can’t bear the humiliation and prefer to take the extreme step,” he said.
