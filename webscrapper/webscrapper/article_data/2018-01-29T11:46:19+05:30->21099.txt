 Dharma Patil, who hailed from   district, had consumed a poisonous substance at the Maharashtra secretariat on January 22 to protest the low returns offered by the state government while acquiring his land for a solar power plant.
 
 He died at the   here last night.
 
 His son   today said, "I will not accept my father's body until the state government accepts our demands. I am not going to accept my father's body because we have been fighting against the injustice done to us."
 
 The farmer's family had claimed that he took the extreme step after several attempts to get appropriate compensation for his land did not yield any results.
 His son had last week told reporters that his father got only Rs four lakh compensation for his five acres of land.
 
 The octogenarian had been visiting the state administrative headquarters for the last three months to complain about the inadequate compensation for his land, his son had said.
 The Maharashtra government had offered an assistance of Rs 15 lakh to the farmer, but his son refused to accept it.
 
 "We were denied proper compensation by the state authorities for the land acquisition. Except us, everybody in our neighbourhood whose land had been acquired was given higher compensation. Why was there such a disparity?" Narendra Patil asked.
 
 Chavan termed it as a serious matter and demanded a judicial probe into it.
