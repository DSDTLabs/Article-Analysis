BENGALURU: Scarves, dupattas, stoles and handkerchiefs are the only things sheltering commuters from the blazing sun at the   stops on either side of   at Hebbal-Kempapura. With no bus shelter, commuters are often seen taking refuge under the skywalk a few metres away.

 Neither the sheer rush — one bus halts there every three minutes — nor the prime location alongside a road that leads to the international airport has been of any help in getting these stops decent shelters to shield commuters. “The absence of a shelter might be fine in winter, but as we get closer to summer, standing under the scorching sun is unbearable,” said Manjula N, a college student, hooded under a dupatta.
 
 Dhruv A, another commuter, said: “In the core areas of the city, there are places with multiple shelters at the same stop. Despite this being a major stop and so many people gathering here every day, there isn’t even one shelter here.”
 
 Even in evenings, dozens of people, luggage in hand, are seen waiting for airport buses. At present, with widening work being carried out on the road adjacent to the highway near the mall, and drain work along the adjacent road and the highway, the waiting space for commuters has shrunk considerably.
 
 “Work on the adjacent BBMP road should be completed in a month. Then we could look at setting up a shelter,” said corporator P V Manjunath. However, a shelter on the side road won’t help much, commuters said.
 
 Officials from BBMP, which is responsible for building bus shelters and is currently trying to replace 2,212 shelters with new ones, said building shelters along the highway is not their responsibility but that of the   (NHAI). “While we are aware that people are being made to wait under the skywalk, nobody has approached us for a bus shelter. We have a spare structure with us and we can try and install it within 15-20 days” said an   official.
