While other actors sink their teeth into a role,   prefers ‘smelling’ it out. Literally! The actress, who has films like ' ' and ' ' in her kitty, approaches her roles through the use of different perfumes. She chooses the fragrance according to the role and the intensity of her character.

 Elaborating on her hatke prep routine, she says, “Every space, person and situation has a unique fragrance. I’m convinced that there is a fragrance that is uniquely yours, which becomes an intrinsic part of one’s personality and resonates with your soul. So, I feel drawn to different kinds of fragrances while playing different characters. They invoke powerful feelings.” Conceding that it may sound strange, she adds, “It’s also instinctive. I keep wearing the perfume associated with the character on the set, but when I am not shooting, I use what I, Aditi, would.” 
 
 What’s more, music too plays an instrumental role in her prep and her playlist changes with every film. “I’m not armed with any hectic techniques; I'm instinctive, intuitive and surrender myself completely to the director and the space I am in. So, music is one of my stimuli,” she concludes.
