The actor turned nostalgic as he was shooting at the same place where they had taken the last shot of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's biopic Bhaag   Bhaag in which Farhan played the Flying Sikh to perfection.

 'They shot at the David Sassoon School in Matunga and it brought back a flood of memories for Farhan,' informs a source close to the actor, adding that they have since moved to Filmcity studio where a jail set has been created.
