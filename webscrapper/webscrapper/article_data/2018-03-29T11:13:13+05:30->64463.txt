MADURAI: The Idol Wing CID branch led by inspector general A   has reached   to inquire into alleged irregularities in the making of Lord   idol that took place during 2003-04. While the police have already arrested a chief sculptor and the then temple administrative official, the team is planning to conduct further inquiries. 

 The team, which reached Palani on Wednesday, will conduct inquiries with the officials from HR&CE on Thursday, said Pon Manickavel. He said that if required there will be further arrests.
 
 Deputy superintendent of police   and inspector   from the wing are also camping in Palani to probe the irregularities in the Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple. According to sources, there was an informal meeting on Wednesday between   and joint commissioner of the temple, which lasted for around 30 minutes.
 
 According to the police the temple officials had decided to make an idol weighing 200 kg in 2003 and   was roped in to make it. The then executive officer was identified as K K Raja. The idol was finished in 2004 and kept in front of the presiding deity. Within six months it was removed as it turned dark and shifted to a room in the temple.
 
 Sources said that making the new idol was part of a larger plan of replacing the old one with the new one and smuggle the older one. Moreover, it is suspected that the accused could have swindled gold jewellery obtained through donations throughout the country to make the idol.
