NEW DELHI: While Delhi   Rail Corporation hopes to go ‘counterless’ at most of its stations,   feel that at least one manual counter should be kept at every station as many find using token vending machines (TVMs) difficult.

 “Perhaps   is trying to modernise its system by replacing manual token counters with vending machines but they must understand that not every commuter is comfortable with the latest technology,” said Dilip Chandak, a private firm employee.
 
 To get a token from a TVM, a commuter has to first select the starting and destination stations and then deposit the type of currency notes displayed on the TVM screen to pay the fare. “It is not difficult if you regularly use TVMs but I have seen that senior citizens and those who are not very educated find it difficult,” Chandak said, adding that it would be better to keep at least one manual counter at every station. 
 
 Abhinav Sharma, a MBA student, said even educated people are often not comfortable using TVMs. “Many new stations, like  , don’t have manual counters and I find it difficult to use TVMs as the instructions are confusing,” he said.
 
 Commuters also complained that TVMs often face snags and don’t accept old or soiled notes. “If the note is even slightly soiled, the machine won’t accept it,” said Swati Sharma, a HR executive. “Also, I often find that if there are three or four TVMs at a station, one or two of these are non-functional,” she said.
 
 Gautam Mukherjee, an accountant who is a regular metro commuter, doesn’t face any problem on week days thanks to his smart card. However, he dreads a metro journey with his family on weekends. “My wife and two children don’t have smart cards and buying tokens on weekends is a big hassle. Most of the time, TVMs don’t function properly or don’t accept cash.” Customer care executives deployed initially are also not there now, he added.
