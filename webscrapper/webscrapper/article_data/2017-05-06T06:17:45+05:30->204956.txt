BHUBANESWAR: A deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of the Crime Branch landed in trouble for allegedly arresting a man in a cheating case in which he had already got bail. The home department last week initiated disciplinary proceedings against DSP   for his alleged negligence and misconduct.

 According to the home departments letter, copy of which is with the TOI, Mohanty arrested   on December 31, 2016, in connection with the alleged land fraud case, though Parida was granted bail by the   high court in the same case on March 26, 2012. "It proves Nalini Ranjan Mohanty did not verify previous official and court records and arrested Parida again. His action amounts to cavalier attitude, gross misconduct and negligence in duty," said the home department's letter, sent to the Crime Branch office in   on April 28 this year. In the letter, Mohanty has been asked to submit an explanation near the home department within thirty days. Forty-three-year-old Parida, a resident of New Colony in Cuttack, faced allegations of grabbing someone's land by forging documents. He is a petty businessman in Cuttack, police said. Though the case was initially registered at   police station in Cuttack on December 7, 2009, the Crime Branch took over the investigation after three weeks. 
 
 Sarbeswar Sahu, a former CB DSP was entrusted to probe the case. Mohanty took over investigation of the cheating case from Sahu on October 1, 2015, following the latter's transfer. During Sahu's investigation period, Parida had surrendered in the court of SDJM-Cuttack Sadar in March 2012 and was granted bail by the high court. Mohanty's alleged negligence was spotted by the same court, where Parida had surrendered earlier. The court pulled up the Crime Branch and sought action against the erring officer. Mohanty refused to comment.
