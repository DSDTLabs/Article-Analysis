HYDERABAD: Though   has been made a criminal offence, a legal expert said the law is not stringent and the   is bailable. "The   is very low under section 354D (stalking) of the IPC. We have observed that during the trail most victims go for compromise outside the court due to family pressure," said KV Bina, a senior assistant public prosecutor in  . 

 Bina said the law is very weak compared to other offences and woman lose faith as the offender gets bail within few days of arrest. "Under the Section, stalking is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years plus fine, but the accused gets bail within three days. When the offence is repeated, it is non-bailable, while such cases are very few as people don't report about it fearing society."
 
 "With the law being bailable, She teams keeps in mind the gravity of the crime and add relevant non-bailable sections," said She Teams ACP, Kavitha.
 
 In past three years, three cases were repeated  . Preventive detention act was invoked against accused and four people were arrested.
