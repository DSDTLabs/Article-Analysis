KALYAN:   into the wall of a   and   worth Rs 65 lakh, including  , on Wednesday .

 The incident came to light at 9.30am on Thursday when Vimal Dave opened his Mataji Jewellery shop, in   area, Kalyan (East) and found the locker broken and all jewellery missing. He then saw athree-foot hole in the wall and informed the Kolsewadi police. The thieves used gas cylinders and cutter machines to drill a hole in the wall of a vacant flat which shared a common wall with the shop and also cut through its locker, taking away 2 kg of gold jewellery and Rs 5 lakh in cash.
 
 Police said flats behind the shop were empty for four years as residents vacated the building for redevelopment, while shopkeepers were waiting till the redevelopment plan was approved. The 35-year-old Prerna building, which has seven shops and eight flats, is dilapidated and the builder who will redevelop it recently asked the shopkeeper to shift. “It was my bad luck as just 15 days ago the builder had asked all of us to shift our shops as he had received the approval for redevelopment,“ Dave said.
 
 The incident shocked jewellers as Thane and Kalyan witnessed several such burglaries in the past. Police suspect more than five people could be involved in the burglary , though CCTV footage has only one whose face was not clear. The area had no security guard and the shop didn't have an alarm system. D B Kamble, assistant commissioner of police, Kalyan region said, “We have formed five city police and crime branch teams for the case.“
