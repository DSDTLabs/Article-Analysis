PANAJI: After enormous data poured in through a survey undertaken by the excise department to identify establishments selling alcohol along national highways, the department is in the process of classifying the locations and categories of the licence holders.

 Officials with the department said that it would require two more days before they start issuing the show cause notices for cancellation of licences to those shops, restaurants, hotels and other outlets located within 500 metres of a national or state highway. “The work is still on and we require some more time to classify the shops. We haven’t begun issuing the notices,” said superintendent of excise Narayan Neurekar.
 
 The   order in December was aimed at increasing road safety as it blamed   for drunk driving incidents. The court imposed a March 31 deadline on states and union territories to shut down liquor outlets near highways and banned them from renewing licences to highway liquor outlets. 
 
  Attorney General   had said that the Supreme Court order banning sale of liquor within a 500-meter radius of state and national highways only applies to liquor shops and not bars and restaurants.
