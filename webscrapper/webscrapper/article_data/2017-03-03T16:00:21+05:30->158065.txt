PANAJI: The   of Panaji ( ) has issued an order to stop work on a new private project at Patto, Panaji, on Thursday. The ordererd was issued following complaints of damage caused to the neighbouring state   due to the ongoing work.

 Sources said that the library’s compound wall facing the construction site had developed cracks as a result of the work and as a result a part of building was sinking. Panaji MLA Sidharth Kunkalienker visited the site for inspection on Thursday. 
 
 Accompanying him were the CCP commissioner, an engineer from the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (GSIDC) and the contractor of the adjoining building. “Work has been stopped as a temporary measure to the problem. We need to find a technical solution to it. That is what we have agreed upon,” Kunkalienker said.
 
 He added the team has further taken a decision that the contractor be asked to call consultants/experts and inform the CCP what measures need to be taken to fix the problem.
 
 Panaji mayor Surendra Furtado said he wasn’t aware about any such order being issued. “The decision was taken by the commissioner without any consultation with me. I was not taken into confidence in the matter. Now that the order has been issued, the CCP will see what must be done.”
 
 Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments, which is working on the project, said, “It’s a possibility that due to excavations carried out in the area, some of the displacements or vibrations might have led to the tilting of the compound wall of the Central Library and some minor cracks in the driveway pavement.”
 
 He said as per the discussion held on Thursday after the site visit, their structural engineers will meet their counterparts of the library and the process is on, pointing out that thre is no crack to the building.
 
 “As developers of repute with nearly 50 years in the real estate industry, we understand our responsibilities to the neighbours of all our projects”,Gera added.
