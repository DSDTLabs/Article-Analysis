MUKTSAR: Unfazed by   directive to political parties against holding rallies on religious days, the Shiromani Akali Dal played the panthic card to the hilt at its political conference at Maghi mela in Muktsar.

 Speaker after speaker, led by SAD president Sukhbir Badal, remembered the contribution of Sikh gurus in taking on the Mughal emperors. Akali leaders said that SAD takes inspiration from Sikh gurus who always fought against tyranny and social evils.
 
 Every leader spent most part of the address in eulogizing the Sikh gurus before taking on the incumbent  . Sukhbir said as per Sikh traditions unleashing repression and tolerating it both were a sin. He also asked masses to imbibe Sikh traditions in taking on the enemy.
 
 SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal and former president Bibi Jagir Kaur asked people to work as per Sikh tradtion and tread the path shown by the gurus.
 
 Bikram Majithia said that Akalis did everything in the name of ‘Waheguru’ and invite hymn singers but the Congress government had invited a Punjabi singer at loan waiver scheme launch at Mansa on January 7.
 
 SAD-BJP tried to put up united show in taking on the Congress in Punjab. Apart from Punjab   president Vijay Sampla, lone BJP MLA from Malwa region at   was present. Sampla said, “We are alliance partners since long and will remain so.”
