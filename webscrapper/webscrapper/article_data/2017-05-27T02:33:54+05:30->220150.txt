KENDRAPADA: Forest officials on Friday failed to undertake the demolition of illegal prawn farms at   in Kendrapada as many prawn farm owners and locals vehemently opposed the move.

 "Around 200 prawn farm owners and locals gathered as soon as we arrived with JCB machines to demolish illegal prawn gherries (farms) at Nalitiapatia, Iswarapur, Paramanandapur and Dangamala villages within the park. They blocked the village road near the prawn farms for which we halted the demolition work," said  , forest range officer of the park.
 
 "We have already razed 200 acres of illegal shrimp farms within four days. We will soon mobilize more police force to demolish all the prawn farms in the park," added the forest officer. All the shrimp farms are illegal within the park as they violate the coastal regulation zone norms and the rulings of the Supreme Court and high court. 
 
 Two years ago, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had declared 192 villages around Bhitarkanika National Park as eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) to prevent ecological damage caused due to development activities around Bhitarkanika. The ESZ norms prohibit any shrimp farming within two km of Bhitarkanika, Nayak said. "Many of us have been eking out a living by doing prawn farming for more than a decade over our land. Forest officials have no right to demolish our prawn farms," said   a prawn farm owner of Dangamala village.
