NAGPUR: Mayor   on Friday postponed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s general body meeting scheduled to be held on Saturday citing “unavoidable circumstances”. Now, the meeting will be held on February 3.

 However, a source pointed out that the meeting was postponed due to absence of municipal commissioner   who is in Mumbai to attend a meeting. Similarly, the ruling party leader   is also out of the town and is undertaking some treatment in Pune.
 
 The absence of municipal commissioner and ruling party leader apparently seems trivial reason for postponement of the GBM, the source said. In the past, the GBMs were held despite absence of top functionaries including mayor, civic chief and others. 
 
 Leader of opposition   said the ruling party has sought his views before postponing the general body meeting. He pointed out with the meeting has some important proposals, the absence of civic chief will delay many important works. So, he too gave his nod for its postponement.
 
 Meanwhile, NMC’s transport committee chairman   too postponed the panel’s meeting on Friday. Now the meeting will be held on January 24.
