NAGPUR:  , an American company promoted by Bhandara entrepreneur Prashant Mishra has tied up with Chinese IT major Baidu Inc.

 It will provide a crucial technology to be used during medical emergencies under Chinese government’s digitalization initiative. Baidu is dubbed to be the Google of China. Click2Cloud also has a unit at Nagpur which would be executing the job bagged under the tie-up.
 
 Termed as lifeline services, Click2Cloud will be providing access to database related to blood banks or organ banks needed during medical emergencies.
 
 “For example, if there is an accident in Beijing city and a particular blood group is needed, in that case the system will access the database and provide details pointing out the nearest available source using artificial intelligence,” Mishra told TOI over telephone from China.
 
 “The mapping system of Baidu will be used in this system, and the technology has been provided by Click2Cloud,” he said. “The system would be initially provided for Beijing city which itself is a vast area. It will be part of China’s own smart cities initiative,” he said, adding, “The work will be executed at our unit in Nagpur. We already have 70 employees and there are plans to to have fresh recruitment of over 150 more.”
 
 “Value of the order generated through the tie-up has been pegged at one core in rupee terms on immediate basis. In a year, it would grow to Rs 20 crore. However, as the work expands, the company expects that the business may run into hundreds of crores,” he said.
 
 “More than the value of the contract, it is the key technology which gives Click2Cloud an edge over others in the deal,” said Mishra.
 
 “Apart from it, Click2Cloud will also be working on migrating the government data on cloud, a technology which it specializes in. The latest trend is to store the dat. Even the Maharashtra government has announced its plans to migrate the data in cloud,” he added.
