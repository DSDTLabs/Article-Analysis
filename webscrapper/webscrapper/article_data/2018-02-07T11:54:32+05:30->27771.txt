NEW DELHI: India "must stop intervening in Malé", said state-owned Chinese media in an editorial today, about the political crisis in the Maldives.

 
 The island nation's embattled President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency there this week and ordered the arrest of top judges and a former president.
 
 India today said it was "disturbed" by the declaration of an emergency by the government there and described as a matter of "concern" the arrests of the Justice and political figures.
 
 China isn't happy with India's response.
 
 "Political struggles are supposed to be internal affairs, and New Delhi has no justification to intervene in Malé's affairs. The Maldives must be under huge pressure from India," said an editorial in  , a publication of China's Communist Party.
