ALLAHABAD:   (AIMIM) leaders staged a   at the Collectorate on Tuesday, demanding that the two   that were closed be reopened. The party claimed that hundreds of people were rendered   and the Muslim community was compelled to live without   ever since the two abattoirs were shut down. 

 The leaders, led by divisonal head Salahuddin, handed over a memorandum to additional city magistrate (first) in which they threatened to go on fast-unto-death from Friday if the abattoirs were not re-opened. City president Afsar Mahmood said, "The slaughterhouses at Atala and Rambagh had been operational for several decades. The national green tribunal had asked the government to revamp them but they were closed, depriving hundreds of people, especially daily-wagers, of their employment."
 
 District president Ibrahim Chaudhry said Ramzan would start from the last week of May and Muslims would want to buy the meat then but that seemed unlikely.
