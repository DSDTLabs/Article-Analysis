MUMBAI: Barely a week after an assistant town planner was shot dead in Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh for action against illegal structures, it has come to light that   BJP MLA   allegedly threatened   officials, in front of the senior police inspector of Kamothe on April 17, that they would be murdered if they set foot in Kamothe and tried to carry out demolition of unauthorized constructions. No FIR was filed though the officials concerned submitted a complaint letter to the police. 

 
  
 
 Confirming the incident, Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani said "the incident was brought to our notice and accordingly, the concerned officials were asked to lodge a complaint with police. However, we have not pursued the matter with the police as MLA Prashant Thakur later clarified to us that whatever he said was in the heat of the moment and he did not mean what he said."
 
 Cidco anti-encroachment team officials had carried out a drive against four illegal under-construction ground-floor structures and illegal shanties and shops that had come up on the 12.5% reserved plots for project-affected persons in sector 14 and 22 of Kamothe. 
 
 After the action, the Cidco squad officials were called to the police station by senior inspector Ashok Naik for a meeting with the local MLA. There, Thakur questioned them for their action and issued the murder threat even after the officials explained the action was carried out following legal procedures.
