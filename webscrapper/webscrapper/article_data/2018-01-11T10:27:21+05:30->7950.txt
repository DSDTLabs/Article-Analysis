VIJAYAWADA: Hopes of realtors were dashed with Governor   not ratifying the bill on Non-Agriculture Land (NALA) tax sent by the state government. According to highly placed sources, the bill was not ratified due to simplified procedures for conversion of land that could lead to misuse. 

 Although the Governor had ratified a similar bill proposed by  , which was even adopted by the state Assembly, it is yet to become an Act. The Andhra bill proposed two main features relating to fees and procedure of NALA conversion. It proposed reduction in NALA tax, which was 5% under the jurisdiction of   ( ) and   (GVMC), to 2%. In case of other areas, the reduction proposed was from 9% to 3%. 
 
 Similar tax rates were proposed in Telangana bill too. The state had proposed that once someone pays tax, a revenue official must compulsorily verify whether the land is owned by the private person or whether the same was grabbed. Only after this verification, any other process would happen. But in the   bill, the conversion process is simplified. As soon as any party pays the challan, conversion is done automatically without verification.
