NEW DELHI: Holding that dance performances in bars are not a form of art which needs to be promoted and protected, the   has told the   that such dances are “vulgar and derogatory”, which need to be regulated to protect the honour and dignity of bar girls.

 Justifying its decision to bring in a new law to put various restrictions on dance bar owners, the state government told the apex court that in many cases   were being used to run prostitution rackets and it was duty-bound to curb such activities.
 
 “The dances in question are not classical forms of dances. The young girls dancing in such premises are not trained artistes. There is no art in their dance. Such dances do have very limited entertainment value. In such a situation, the possibility of dances becoming obscene to attract customers is inherent,” the government said in its affidavit filed in the apex court.
