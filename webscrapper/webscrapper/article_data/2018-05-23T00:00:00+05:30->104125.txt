 has become a household name ever since the promo video of the serial   (OOOR) released. And there couldn’t be a better person than  , who plays Rasaathi in the serial, to have gotten into the skin of the character. She plays the role of an obese woman, battling body shaming and also trying to find her ‘rajakumaran’. Talking about her character, Ashwini, a techie from Bengaluru, says, “I had participated in a   reality show along with my family and that was when director   approached me for this role. He narrated the plot and I took a day or two to decide. I thought it would be a different experience and so, decided to take it up. It has just been over a month, and the show has already changed my life.”

 For Ashwini, the challenge was to come out of the shell and let go of her inferiority complex. Now, she says that she has gained a lot of confidence after her character in the serial has garnered good response. She adds, “One day, someone came up to me and said that after watching the serial, he felt comfortable about the fact that his wife was overweight.” 
 
 Has she had any experiences of body shaming? She replies, “I am fat and I am happy to be that way. I don’t know what people talk behind my back, but there’s nothing that I can recall.” 
 
 Ask her about her ‘rajakumaran’ in real life and she breaks into a laugh, “Ours was an arranged marriage. That was also the first proposal that came for me. My husband accepts me the way I am.”
 
 Talking about obese women being sidelined as comedians in Tamil cinema,   says, “For me, the role that I do is important and the message that I send out through the character matters. No matter how you look, people will still pass comments, but you shouldn’t be bothered about all that.”
