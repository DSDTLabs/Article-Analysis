PUNE: A   (GR), issued on March 1, makes it clear that people caught manufacturing and   more than three times will be jailed for a year under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers and Drug Offenders Act, 1981 (MPDA). 

 "The GR was issued after social crusader   met chief minister   last month and urged him to act tough against the business of illicit liquor," said Hazare's secretary  .
 
 The resolution also provides for creation of Gram Rakshak Dals in each village. The teams will alert the police about illicit liquor dens or such businesses operating in the area. 
 
 Besides outlining preventive action to be taken by the police and excise departments in an effort to check the malpractice, the resolution has also outlined the action that the two departments must take based on tip-offs from citizens or Gram Rakshak Dals. 
 
 According to the GR, criminal cases must be filed against offenders caught for illegally manufacturing, selling or distributing illicit liquor. The role of the person, who owns the property where such activities are carried out, must also be investigated and a criminal case must be filed against him/her if he/she is found to be conniving with such offenders, the resolution states.
