Vadodara: High drama prevailed ahead of the arrival of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader Hardik Patel at Karamsad in Anand district with the BJP holding protests there and planning to show black flags to him. 

 But Hardik avoided any confrontation with the protestors at the town.
 
 Hardik was to visit the memorial for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and pay tributes to Sardar there. BJP members remained present in large numbers outside the memorial and raised slogans against Hardik. They held banners against Hardik and had threatened to wave black flags at him.
 
 PAAS members had also remained present outside the Sardar Smarak and raised slogans in support of Hardik. A posse of policemen remained present at the site to ensure that no untoward incident took place there. Hardik arrived at the memorial using an alternative route and paid tributes to Sardar Patel. He said that the protests were being held against him as vengeance for the incident of a slipper being thrown on a minister in the assembly. Hardik said that he was just a common man and it was a matter of pride that such protests were being held against him. 
 
 The PAAS leader said that Sardar Patel had completed most of his tasks, but if something had remained he would try to fulfil that. He left the memorial avoiding confrontation with the protestors.
