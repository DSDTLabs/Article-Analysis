AHMEDABAD: As peals of laughter gave way to tears, the evening spelt absolute magic.   of the BAPS made the packed hall ‘Experience the Magic of Love’ on the inaugural day of the   lecture series. In his brilliant, almost two-hour lecture, he said, “Just the feeling of being loved changes the entire worldview, the lack of it is a disaster.” 

 Quoting from the scriptures, history, anecdotes to real-life examples and even taking a dig at politics, swamiji captivated the audience with his flawless speech. “Love is not a noun, it is a verb. Unfortunately, most of our love is selfish,” he said. “Most of the time, we fool the entire world by taking pictures, while in reality we are taking selfies. We are always in the selfie mode. The most important part is to be selfless, to remove yourself from the equation of your own life.”
 
 Just the ability to give up something you deserve will make people fall in love with you.   still remains the uncrowned Prime Minister of India, and is always remembered. Swamiji said, “Giving up vengeance is the path of humans, else why are we humans? We need to revive and regenerate and add life and love to everything we do. Taking away love from God also becomes a figment of imagination. It is the love of God that redeems you.”
 
 He further said, “It is important not to commercialize love, but personalize it. We learn only from the people we love, the rest is all information and unless you’ve mastered the technique of love, everything else is a non-entity. Historians till today debate Hitler’s hate for humanity was his failed love. The only Jew he personally gave safe passage to was the doctor who saved his mother. Hence, love can melt the hardest heart.”
