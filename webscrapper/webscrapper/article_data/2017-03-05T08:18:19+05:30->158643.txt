HYDERABAD: As part of the report, officials of the   (V&E) department have submitted several recommendations to the   to curb   in the state. 

 Officials have recommended provisional/temporary affiliation or   to junior colleges run by the two groups. Since colleges were found to be collecting a huge amount from students in the name of long-term, short-term coaching, V&E officials have recommended regulating the fee structure. “A committee needs to be constituted to evolve a new method in deciding the fee structure by categorising colleges based on the parameters viz. area where it is established (mandal, corporation, municipality etc.), infrastructure provided, salaries offered to the teaching staff, etc. and arriving at category-wise fee structure which would be acceptable to all the stakeholders,” recommended the officials in the report. 
 
 The V&E officials have also suggested that the TSBIE must take remedial steps to streamline the renewal of affiliation and sanctioning of additional classes. “Board may be instructed to insist that private colleges apply for renewal of affiliation well before the commencement of classes and to follow the rules and regulations scrupulously by visiting the filed before such renewing or sanction of new colleges,” the report stated.
