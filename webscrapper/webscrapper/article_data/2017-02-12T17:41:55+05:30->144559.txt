CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu school education minister K   on Sunday met   MLA R   at the latter’s residence here. 

 After the meeting and a sumptuous lunch at the former city police commissioner’s, the minister told TOI: "He is a long-time friend. I took the liberty of meeting him at his residence.”
 
 He said though the AIADMK   till date had taken a neutral stance on the issue, “I have invited him to lend his support to chief minister O  ," who revolted against party general secretary V K  . 
  
 "I hope he will take a positive decision," the minister said. 
 
  "There are many more elected representatives who want to wait and watch. My message to them would be when there is dharma and adharama, one must always take the side of dharma," he said.
 
 In a Facebook post on Saturday, Nataraj said he continued to remain and work out of his office. Multiple visits to his office and enquiries with his staff and locals seem to suggest that the MLA had not stepped into his office in the last three days.
 
 The MLA’s Facebook post said, "I am not anywhere else as has been wrongfully claimed by a few people in social media. I am sure you all know about me by now and I would never take a break from discharging my duties towards Mylapore. I would also like to clarify as regards my duties as an MLA vis-a-vis the current situation."
 
 His Facebook post got more 2,800 likes, 270 shares and 550 comments -- most urging the MLA to join the Panneerselvam's camp.
 
 Meanwhile Pandiarajan’s staff said: "A lot of Tamil people, including members of Nataraj's own Mylapore constituency, are vehement supporters of our chief minister. It must also be remembered that the people of Mylapore are quite familiar with their chief minister zipping in and out of the constituency, given he resides on Greenways Road and given the fact that he has done a lot of stellar work during cyclone Vardah."
