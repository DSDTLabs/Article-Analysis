LUCKNOW: Running a   without recognition? Get ready to face the music. Tightening noose around unrecognised schools,   has asked its officers to identify schools which are neither owned or controlled by state government nor the local authority but are functioning in the state.   will be imposed on schools running without obtaining certificate of recognition or running it despite recognition being withdrawn. According to some estimates, there are close to 2,000   running in the state. 

 In a letter written by basic education director Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh to all regional assistant education directors and basic education officers (of each district), no school, other than those established, owned or controlled by the government or local authority, as per the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), 2009 can function without obtaining a certificate of recognition from such authority. 
 
 In UP, education mafia seek recognition to run one school but expand their wings and operate on multiple branches and all are unrecognised. Often, students enrolled in these unrecognised schools take classes in recognised schools. They are issued documents like transfer certificate from the school which is recognised. Therefore, there is no proper record of number of students and unrecognised schools running in UP, said an official.
