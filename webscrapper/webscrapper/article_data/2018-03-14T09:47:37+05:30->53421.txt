HYDERABAD: The   has decided to take legal recourse against the expulsion of two of its legislators and suspension of 12 members.

 “We will move the   on Wednesday,” advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar told TOI at the   (CLP) office on Tuesday afternoon. “There are enough grounds on which the court can be approached for justice. The issue will actually explode in the face of the government,” Jandhyala Ravi Shankar said.
 
 Indicating the grounds on which the matter can be taken to court, he pointed out that in earlier judgments, the President’s address was not considered a joint sitting of the two Houses and therefore was not part of the proceedings of either House. When the President addresses a joint sitting, the business rules of the   do not apply, he said, adding that the business rules of the House are not applicable when the governor chairs the session too. The business rules cannot be applied as there was no business transaction, he said.
 
 While a political plan of action was chalked out by Congress legislators at the CLP office consequent to the suspension and expulsions, it was only towards afternoon that the possibility of a legal option materialised. “What has happened is gross injustice. We will also go with the legal option to get justice,” senior Congress legislator and former minister   said.
 
 Another option declared by TPCC chief   was to meet the President and explain about the suspensions and expulsions. This is in addition to the protests chalked out in the state.
