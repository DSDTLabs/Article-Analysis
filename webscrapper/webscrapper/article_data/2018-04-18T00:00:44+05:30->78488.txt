NAVI MUMBAI: The state government has buckled under pressure from the local   unit and transferred   commissioner,  , said political observers. PCMC leader of the opposition,   said, “Shinde did not allow the ruling party to control the corporation. BJP kept pressurising the CM and finally he was transferred.” 

 Shinde, too, was taken in by surprise on Monday. “I had no idea about the transfer. I have worked for the interest of the citizens and will continue to do so in whatever capacity I am assigned,” said Shinde, who will take over as CEO of the  .
 
 Residents who have supported him with signature campaigns, online petitions and silent protest said that Shinde should have continued as the Panvel civic chief. “His integrity is above doubt. He should have been allowed to stay for more time,” said activist Ravi Srivastava. 
 
  Arun Bhise, head of Citizens’ Unity Forum, said, “He was making life better for citizens as a commissioner. It was because of him that a lot of lawlessness had stopped.”
 
 Apart from facing constant criticism from the ruling BJP, Shinde survived a no-confidence motion passed against him on March 26 with the state’s support. 
 
 Corporators had repeatedly accused him of inefficiency. Hours before his transfer, Shinde conducted a raid and busted illegal sand mining in the Dehrang dam site and arrested the miscreants. Shinde had been cracking the whip on illegal hawkers and encroachments too.
 
 Paresh Thakur, BJP house leader in PCMC, said, “Now Panvel will witness a makeover as nothing was done during his tenure.”
 
 Ganesh Deshmukh, who has been appointed in his place, told TOI, “I have received the transfer order and will join PCMC as soon as possible.”
