AHMEDABAD: The   – Ahmedabad – will host a   on sustainability – ‘Ung Svensk Form 2018’ (USF 2018). The exhibition, which focuses on Swedish design and innovations, will be inaugurated at   (NID), Ahmedabad, by consul-general of Sweden, Ulrika Sundberg and NID director, Pradyumna Vyas, on Tuesday. The exhibition will remain open at NID till March 2.

 USF 2018 was organized in Hong Kong and Seoul as part of its tour in Asia and now it will be organized in India. Sources said that USF 2018 has been initiated with a view to increasing the knowledge and widening the scope of new, innovative design. Sharing more about the concept of the exhibition, Vyas said, “The exhibition focusses on a sustainable economy and emphasizes the concept of recycling and upcycling products. A number of products showcased would be forms of textiles and bamboo.”
 
 Projects such as optical illusion aesthetics, digital printed-cum-embroidered artwork on textiles and furniture-cum-swinger, among others, by designers from Sweden will be part of the exhibition.
 
 Apart from art works by Swedish designers, works of students of National Institute of Design will also be presented at the exhibition. This also includes innovative designs prepared by NID students a few months ago, using demonetized currency waste as part of a competition held there. “Prototypes of sustainable designs that have been created in the past will also be showcased at the exhibition. Two of them will be selected and put on display. Some of the forms which were prepared by NID students include those made using demonetized currency waste,” added Vyas.
 
 Along with the exhibition, Swedish designers, Katja Beckman and Maja Michaelsdotter Eriksson will also be discussing “environmental and sustainability issues effect material choices” with students.
