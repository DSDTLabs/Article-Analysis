BENGALURU:   was established by a visionary who wanted to give engineers to the world: then  , Sir M Visvesvaraya. The technical institute may boast of many  , but it is Sir MV’s name which gives it the most significance. Though the government-run institution battles growing competition from private engineering colleges, the hope of receiving the Centre for Excellence title is not lost. 

 It’s journey began in 1917, when it was set up as College of Engineering, Bangalore, by M Visvesvaraya with the backing of Mysore maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar. The idea was to come up with an alternative in Karnataka as engineering colleges in Madras ( ) and Poona (Pune) were not able to provide enough seats for students from Mysore. While delivering a speech at the college, Visvesvaraya had said, “We wanted admission for 10 students annually but the authorities at Madras and Poona could enrol (just) two or three. Thereupon, we decided to start a college of our own in Bangalore city.”
 
 A retired chief engineer, KR Seshachar was appointed the first principal of the college; he has had 24 successors. Under the University of Mysore for many years, in 1964 the college was handed over to the fledgling Bangalore University. While most expected the institution to move to Visvesvaraya Technological University, which was set up in 1998, UVCE was among the two engineering colleges which were spared the transition. Today, it is located at KR Circle, 13kms from BU’s Jnanabharathi campus. 
 
 From mechanical and civil engineering to over 30 programmes for undergraduate and postgraduate students, the journey of the institution, though full of roadblocks, has been momentous. 
 
 “Being a government-run college in 2017 is disadvantageous for an institution like UVCE. But I didn’t think twice before joining because of the name attached to it – Sir M Visvesvaraya. The welcoming atmosphere makes one feel at ease,” said Vyshakh K, a final-year civil engineering student of the college. 
 
 
 
 When it comes to shifting of the campus to Jnanabharathi, students and faculty members unanimously oppose the idea. Even the alumni are against the relocation. “No matter how big a land they provide at Jnanabharathi, UVCE’s value comes from where it stands right now,” said Jaffer MK, a consultant and alumnus of the college. 
 
 A faculty member of the computer science department, Shobha M (name changed) travels every day from Nagarbhavi to KR Circle. Although the relocation would benefit many students and teachers like her, Shobha is not on board. “If distance was an issue, I wouldn’t be teaching here for the past 10 years. UVCE belongs here,” she said.
 
 
 
 
 *“In the literature of scientific associations in the West, engineering is defined “as the art of directing men and controlling the forces and materials of nature for the benefit of the human race”.
 
 *“When a person is educated as an engineer…the work may help him obtain employment and income for himself. It may help the country in increasing products of value”.
 
 *In this country, equipment for practical work is most necessary. Education should not be developed on lines which will best serve her immediate purpose. Imitations of even the best countries will not help us so long as the majority of our countrymen remain illiterate and the equipment of educational institutions happens to be poor.”
