People often assume that being inexpressive makes them appear more cool, but a study suggests that smiling is considered more appealing than an inexpressive attitude.

 
 "We found over and over again that people are perceived to be cooler when they smile compared to when they are inexpressive in print advertisements," said Caleb Warren from the   in the US.
 
 "Being inexpressive makes people seem unfriendly or cold rather than cool," Warren said. For the study, published in the  , the researchers asked participants to view print advertisements for a clothing brand, and the model in the ad was either smiling or not.
 
 Then the participants rated the extent to which the model seemed cool on a sevenpoint scale.
 
 The participants consistently rated the smiling models as cooler than the inexpressive models. When a news article showed mixed martial arts fighters who were going to face one another, participants rated the inexpressive athlete as more cool and dominant.
 
 When the context changed to a friendly meeting with fans, the participants rated the smiling fighter as cooler. The study showed that participants had a less favourable impression of the brand when the models were inexpressive.
 
 The findings not only have implications for advertisers who are striving to make favourable impressions with consumers, but also for people as they relate to one another.
