HYDERABAD: Hyderabad traffic police and officials of   (TSRTC) are scouting for half an acre of land on the Bhoiguda-Chilkalguda side to de-congest vehicular traffic at the  's main entrance.

 While a long-term plan to put an end to the traffic mayhem is being studied jointly by the officers from TSRTC, traffic police, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, Hyderabad Metro Rail and South Central Railway, the Hyderabad traffic police along with RTC officials have come up with a suggestion to terminate the RTC buses at   point without allowing them to pass through Oliphant rail bridge.
 
 Traffic cops said that if hundreds of RTC buses coming from Uppal ­Tarnaka side, Warisguda-Sithaphalmandi and RTC CrossroadsMusheerabad sector terminated at Chilkalguda-Bhoiguda point itself, it would help in easing traffic congestion on the other side of the Oliphant bridge. “We have sought half acre from South Central Railway. Even if we get less than half acre, we can develop a bus terminal on the Chilkalguda-Bhoiguda side as an immediate measure to decongest traffic at the railway station,“ said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) A V  .
 
 “We are also going to hold meeting with Setwin drivers and are scouting for an alternate site for hawkers to free up footpaths and road shoulders, a senior traffic cop said.
 
 The traffic cops are also working on widening the old Bhoiguda road.
