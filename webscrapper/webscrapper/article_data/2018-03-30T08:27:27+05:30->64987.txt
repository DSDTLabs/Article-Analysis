BENGALURU: A 32-year-old   allegedly murdered her   on Wednesday night after he insisted that he sleep with her 14-year-old   in her residence at   near Peenya in north Bengaluru. 

 Roopa fed Raghu, a resident of Dasarahalli, dinner laced with sleeping tablets, tied him up, stabbed him in the stomach with a kitchen knife and and slit his throat with an eelige mane (a traditional cutter and grater board).
 
 The incident came to light around 1.30am on Thursday when Roopa’s two daughters woke up and found their mother sitting next to Raghu’s body in a pool of blood. The children ran out of the house screaming, waking up their neighbours. Alerted by them, Peenya police rushed to the spot and took Roopa into custody.
 
 Police said Roopa came in contact with Raghu, a private factory employee, six months ago. They became friends and later developed a relationship. But Roopa began avoiding Raghu after she found out that he was coveting her elder daughter. Irked by this, Roopa warned Raghu against visiting her house. However, Raghu learnt that Roopa’s husband had gone to his home town of Tiptur in Tumakuru district on Wednesday night and came to her house. 
 
 Roopa told police that Raghu, who was under the influence of liquor, forcibly had sex with her, and expressed his desire to sleep with her elder daughter. Roopa managed to convince him into having dinner first. She served him ragi mudde and sambar laced with sleeping tablets. After both her daughters went to sleep, Roopa killed him, police said.
