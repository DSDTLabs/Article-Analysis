LUCKNOW: BSP chief   said on Saturday that the SP feud was a drama orchestrated by   out of “putra moh“ (love for son) to project Akhilesh Yadav as the undisputed leader in the party. “Mulayam even sidelined his brother   for the sake of his son. Shivpal has now been restricted to one constituency ,“ she said.

 Mayawati claimed that the SP feud is till brewing at the grassroots and the two warring factions would try to defeat each other in the elections. Mayawati appealed to Muslims and other communities “not to waste their votes“ by voting in favour of SP or Congress-SP alliance.
 
 BSP chief accused the   of trying to ally with the SP which was responsible for Muzaffarnagar riots, Dadri lynching, Mathura violence and Bulandshahr rape. “I would rather advice the Congress to contest elections alone or ally with smaller parties,“ she added.
 
 Reiterating that SP and BJP were hand-in-glove, Mayawati said the SP government spared the BJP leaders who were accused in Muzaffarnagar riots. “Those who should have been behind bars are now contesting elections,“ Mayawati said.
 
 Accusing the BJP of promoting nepotism by giving tickets to kin of its leaders, Mayawati said this trend has led to infighting in the saffron camp.
 
 She also accused the BJP of conspiring to scrap reservation for dalits and backwards and warned that any such attempt would lead to a backlash from the underprivileged.“They would teach a lesson to the the BJP,“ she added.
 
 `Will consider if Shivpal wants to join BSP'
 
 BSP chief Mayawati on Saturday said that if approached, she would consider taking SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's younger brother Shivpal in her party. “Agar wo humse guhar lagayenge...toh hum sochenge (If he comes with a request, I will think about it),“ she said, responding to a question during the press meet.
