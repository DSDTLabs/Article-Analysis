Coimbatore: Cracking the whip on rampant sand smuggling reported from the region, the district administration on Tuesday decided to book sand smugglers under the goondas Act. Collector TN Hariharan,  , said a team would be set up to catch the miscreants.

 TOI had reported on April 9 how sand was being smuggled from the Noyyal riverbed at Alandurai and neighbouring areas by locals. Government officials were unable to take any strong action due to lack of political will. Also, police officers and revenue officials did not have the required manpower and power to take action against the violators.
 
 In a press release, the collector said sand smuggling was resulting in environmental degradation in the area. “Sand is important for improving the groundwater table and to ensure water did not enter the farmlands nearby and flood the area. So, we will take stringent action against the sand smugglers and book them under the goondas Act,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, activists and youth wing members of Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) petitioned the collector demanding that the sand from the seized truck at CODISSIA a few days ago should be dumped into the Noyyal riverbed, where it belonged. “A truck carrying sand smuggled from Noyyal river had reached CODISSIA grounds and we informed police. Instead of taking action against the violators, police booked a case against us. They claimed that it was M-sand without inspecting it. The mines and quarries department has not been informed about it. Tahsildhar and revenue divisional officers are also only passing the buck. So, we wanted the collector to take strong action and ensure this sand is dumped into the river,” state deputy secretary of PMK youth wing Ashok Srinithi said.
 
 The activists in Alandurai have formed Noyyal Paadhugaapu Kuzhu to save the river. They will work with the police and the revenue officials to stop sand smuggling.
