CHENNAI: Almost three months after the suicide of   don   in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, forensic officials who analysed   samples of the body and those of his daughter   have confirmed that the body brought from the Southeast Asian country was indeed Dhanapalan’s.

 Soon after Dhanapalan’s body arrived at Chennai airport on October 16, 2017, the Kancheepuram police took it to the government hospital in Chengalpet. They collected samples of tissues, nail and hair strands for a DNA confirmation of his identity. A set of Dhanapalan’s fingerprints collected by state crime records bureau (SCRB) experts matched those collected when   was apprehended in 2009 in connection with a crime in Kancheepuram. The DNA samples taken from Dhanapalan’s daughter Dhanalakshmi matched those taken from the don’s body, the state forensic laboratory confirmed a few days ago.

Sridhar, who had been facing 37 cases, including seven of murder, in Kancheepuram, escaped in 2013 to Dubai from where he allegedly continued to run his crime empire. In January 2017, he left Dubai for Cambdia.
