NAINITAL: Police have initiated inquest proceedings into the CCTV footage purportedly showing a man with an iron rod kicking a woman at an upmarket gym at the only shopping mall in  .

 Though no complaint has been lodged by the victim, police have handed over the investigation to the Haldwani circle officer, after the video went viral on various social media platforms.
 
 Haldwani additional superintendent of police   said the incident came to his knowledge after the video was circulated on social media platforms. “I have ordered an inquiry, although we have not received any complaints yet,” he added.
 
 The man in video clip — also available with TOI — could be seen wielding an iron rod and advancing aggressively towards the woman. Although he did not attack her with the rod, both could be seen sparing over some issue, which is inaudible.
 
 The video further shows the man kicking the woman, who falls on the floor. Soon, other men and women exercising at the gym approach the man, but he refuses to calm down and gets entangled in a verbal duel with a woman security guard. However, when approached, the gym owners refused to comment on the incident.
 
 Shanti Jeena, a Haldwani-based social activist, said, “This is not just violence against a single woman, but an attack on women as a whole. Whatever is her mistake, no man has right to assault a woman like this. We will protest against such heinous acts.”
