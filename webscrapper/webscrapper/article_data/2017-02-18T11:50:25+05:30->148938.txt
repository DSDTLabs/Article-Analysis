MUMBAI: In the hot afternoon sun a near silence engulfs the headquarters of gangster turned politician Arun Gawli’s Akhil Bharatiya Sena (ABS) headquarters at   in Byculla. 

 “Madam (Geeta Gawli) is unwell. Her secretary Girish will meet you soon. Wait here,” said a middle-aged man offering this correspondent tea. A while later Girish came out announcing that “Madam can’t meet right now” but got her on phone. Sounding tired and coughing, Geeta said: “Some of the areas in the ward (212) were earlier with my chachi (aunt, Arun Gawli’s sister-in-law Vandana Gawli). I will fix those problems if I win again.”
 
 Winning the turf of ‘Daddy’, as ardent Gawli supporters call him, could be tough for Geeta, two-term corporator and inheritor of the gangster’s legacy as Daddy is incarcerated for a 2008 murder. If Dagdi Chawl is not abuzz with much activity amidst campaigning, the party symbol ‘siti’ (whistle) may go silent and its slogan ‘siti bajao, Mumbai jagao’ may become a joke. Last time the Sena-BJP didn’t field their candidate from here. This time BJP’s Mandakini Khamkar and Sena’s Sonal Saigaonkar threaten to cut into Geeta’s non-Muslim votes while three Muslims—Noor Saba Yusuf Chaudhary (MIM), Rukhsana Saeed Moosa (SP) and Nazia Ashfaque Siddiqui ( )—may corner a substantial chunk of the 65% Muslim votes. “
 
 Though Siddiqui is confident his wife will win, the odds are stacked against her too. Rukhsana Saeed Moosa, wife of former MIM worker Saeed Moosa, challenges both MIM and Congress candidates. “MIM is no longer in race here. Its MLA Waris Pathan who we had backed to the hilt is visible only at wedding and birthday parties. The people will pack his candidate now and him off two years later,” said Saeed Moosa at his Agripada office. “Our votes are intact. These are extortionists who were kicked out of the party because they were maligning the party’s name,” said Pathan won in 2014 in the heart of Mumbai (Byculla) on an MIM ticket.
