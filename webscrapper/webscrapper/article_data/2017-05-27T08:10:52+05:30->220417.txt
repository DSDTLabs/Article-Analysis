AMRITSAR: The death of former Punjab DGP K P S Gill, who is credited with eliminating terrorism from the state, has evoked a mixed response. Besides   leaders, a section of Sikhs and a majority of Hindus mourned the death of the ‘supercop’, but a section of Sikhs termed   a consequence of his misdeeds.

 Talking to TOI, Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbchan Singh said Gill reaped what he had sown and he wouldn’t get a place in hell since he had orchestrated Sikhs’ killings in Punjab.
 
 Senior BJP leader and former health minister   said Gill’s death was a loss to nation, especially to Punjab.
 
 “People of Punjab can never pay his debts as he was the person who eliminated terrorism from the state with courage and acumen,” she said. Crediting Punjab’s peace and development to Gill, the BJP’s firebrand leader rued that though successive governments didn’t give him the due honour but every patriotic Punjabi bows his head before Gill.
 
 Many people posted messages on the social media expressing their views on the death of Gill. Bali K Deol, in his post on Facebook, called “Gill a butcher of Sikhs.” “This mass murderer was the prime tool used in the genocide that wiped out a whole generation of Sikhs in 90s,” Deol mentioned.
 
 B S Goraya, in his comment on Facebook, said, “Gill was the blotch on Indian democracy.”
 
 Describing Gill as a ‘warrior hero’, Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka said he eradicated terrorism from Punjab at a time when some foreign powers wanted to break India by making a separate state Khalistan. He said many countries used Gill’s experience to root out militancy and gave him due honour.
 
 That was the time when terrorists were gaining grounds in Punjab, Gill took charge of the state’s police and delivered his duty judiciously, said another Congress leader
