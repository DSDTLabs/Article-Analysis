NEW DELHI: If a discussion paper released by The   ( ) is to be believed, Delhi may need to shift its attention to the growing levels of NOx to combat  . 

 ‘Air pollution in Urban Centres of India’, released on Thursday, looks at the capital’s PM10 and NOx levels from the late 1990s to 2015 in respect to the growing number of vehicles in Delhi.
  
  
 According to the report, continued efforts to control air pollution have managed to secure a drop in Delhi’s average PM10 levels since 2011. However, the levels of concentration of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) have been constantly on the rise, increasing in parallel to the number of cars.
 
 The data, between 1999 and 2015, showed Delhi’s average PM10 levels were around 170 micrograms per cubic metre in 1999 when the city had close to 40 lakh vehicles. These levels touched the peak in 2009 when the average PM10 concentration was around 250 micrograms per cubic metre. It has since fallen, and was 180 micrograms per cubic metre in 2015. 
 
 Over the past two decades, besides adopting measures like switching to CNG, rollouts of BS II and III and introduction of the metro, some industries have also been shifted out, said Sumit Sharma, associate director, Teri. 
 
 The data during the same period showed Delhi’s NOx concentrations nearly doubling from around 35 micrograms per cubic metre in 1999 to around 65 in 2015 when the vehicle count touched 85 lakhs. “There was no decrease observed in NOx concentrations, pointing to the fact that NOx control measures have not been enforced with required intensity,” the paper stated.
 
 While there is no prescribed limit for NOx, NO2 has a safe limit of 80 micrograms per cubic metre — a standard that is often breached in winter and autumn months. According to an IIT Kanpur study on air pollution in the capital, NO2 undergoes a chemical transformation to form fine secondary particles in the form of nitrates, adding to the existing PM2.5 and PM10 levels.
 
 “The focus needs to shift towards NOx levels as well. No vehicle is now tested for NOx during PUC testing,” said Sharma. This situation, Sharma added, is likely to improve from 2020 due to Euro-VI norms. “Meanwhile, we also need to take a look at power plants, one of the biggest sources of NOx emissions.”
