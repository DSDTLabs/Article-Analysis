JAIPUR: It was literally ‘foot in mouth’ for state health minister Kalicharan Saraf when he remarked on former vice-chancellor of  , professor Dev Swaroop. Saraf said that Swaroop has been using prefix of ‘Dr’ without any PhD. His statement came in support of RU vice-chancellor  , who later in the day resigned due to controversy over his academic shortcomings. 

 Reacting to the statement, Swaroop informed TOI that he had done PhD three decades ago and DLitt 17 years ago. “Such irresponsible statement from the minister is not expected,” said Swaroop who offered to send his CV to Saraf. He added that he has been a member of executive council of over two dozen universities and was visiting faculty at   before taking up the charge as V-C of RU. Notably, Swaroop resigned due to non-cooperation from the state government. His tenure was from July 2013 to November 2014.
