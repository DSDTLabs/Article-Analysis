The withdrawal of   ( ) from the Central Cabinet, though a well-calculated move by party president and chief minister  , has put the ruling party in   at political crossroads.

 Though TDP may sail with BJP for now, Naidu has dropped enough hints that he may have to reconsider the ‘party-to-party’ alliance if there’s no change in the Centre’s alleged step-motherly attitude towards Andhra Pradesh. And in case TDP breaks its electoral alliance with BJP, both parties may have to search for new poll partners, leading to a new politico-electoral scenario at the 2019 hustings.
 
 The TDP leadership may prefer Jana Sena of Pawan Kalyan. It may even seek support of Left parties as in the past to further consolidate electoral base. But TDP may find a competitor in BJP in wooing   to its side. Jana Sena, formed before 2014 general elections, has thus far not tested its electoral strength directly, but both TDP and BJP believe Pawan Kalyan had helped them beat YSRCP of YS Jaganmohan Reddy. The TDP-BJP combine scraped through the elections with just 2% difference in total votes polled. On his part,   too may search for electoral partner, though he went alone in 2014.
 
 Incidentally, TDP has never contested an election on its own ever since it was formed in 1982. It has sailed either with the Left or BJP or both. Given the tough electoral battles fought in AP, Naidu may not dare go independently in the next polls.
