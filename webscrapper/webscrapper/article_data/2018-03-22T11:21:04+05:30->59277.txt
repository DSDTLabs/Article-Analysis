VIJAYAWADA: The Opposition parties in AP have given a call to block the national highways on Thursday in protest against the denial of special category status (SCS) to the state. Interestingly, the ruling TDP is also set to support this blockade. CM   had asked his TDP leaders to support the protest.

 TDP’s support is all set to bring vehicular traffic on the national highways in AP to a standstill for over two hours. Congress, YSR Congress, CPI and CPM had given the call, while   had extended its support. With the TDP’s support, the protest is set to be total and peaceful. Naidu said India should have Japan’s trade union culture, where people work for more hours to express their protest.
 
 Meanwhile in Guntur, YSR Congress chief   blamed Naidu for solely being responsible for Centre not granting SCS to AP. He said that Naidu had virtually mortgaged SCS to Centre for his selfish gains and started voicing his concern on the issue only upon learning about the public anger.
