Noida: The   stamp and registry department has recorded a shortfall of Rs 462.2 crore from its annual target in financial year 2016-17. The department had an annual target of Rs 2,223.6 crore but it collected only Rs 1,761.4 crore from April 2016 to March 2017.

 The department started recording a significant fall in the registration of properties since the demonetisation of November 2016.
 
 Keshav Kumar, ADM (finance and revenue), said the stamp and registration department had a target of Rs 207.08 crore   in March. “The department could generate Rs 183.10 crore only. A total of Rs 1,761.40 crore revenue has been generated in the financial year 2016-17 by the stamp and registration department,” he said.
 
 In the financial year 2015-16, the stamp and registration department had generated a total of Rs 2,006.76 crore. Industry experts said the change was because of demonetisation as most people had no money to register properties.
 
 To put a cap on revenue loss, the government had allowed the department to collect the property registration fee of Rs 20,000 in old currency notes till December 15, but old currency notes were not accepted for stamp duty. Officials of the district administration and revenue department also conducted inspection drives at newly developed housing societies to ensure people do not move into their houses before registration. However, this did not yield the desired results.
 
 Moreover, the district   also suffered a revenue deficit. The excise department had an annual target of Rs 638.15 crore but it generated only Rs 495.58 crore.
