CHANDIGARH: Following a five-city tour agenda, French   ensemble Mezcal Jazz Unit held a deeply engrossing rhapsody with tabla maestro Bickram   as part of the Bonjour India.

 The sound of tabla and sitar, absolutely in sync with the creations of trumpet and base guitar, transported the the city Plaza to the sands of Arabian Nights with exclusively Bohemian symphonies, when   de Gouvello, the bass player and composer from the band led the musical sequence. 
 
 The collaborative jazz project, rising and dipping with the beats, paused at the interlude, only to collect pace again along with a perfect blend with the sound of sitar and the foot-tapping rhythm triggered by Ghosh’s fingers on Tabla.
 
 Having performed in Kolkata and Lucknow before this, as part of the launch of Bonjour India, the history of musical collaboration between Ghosh and Mezcal Jazz Unit has survived decades of partnership.
 
 The unique Jazz trio was founded back in 1986 in   by bassist   and reflects the singular and diverse identity of the group with its relevance to current European jazz streams.
 
 One the other hand, recognised as one of the greatest Tabla maestros from India, Ghosh holds the distinction of being a tall name in the Indo-Western fusion and has been a part of three Grammy nominated albums including George Harrison’s 'Brainwashed’. He also played for Pt Ravi Shankar’s album ‘Full Circle’. 
 
 The musical evening sparked an effervescent feeling of freshness with the blend of Indian classical with French jazz performance.
 
 With a duration of a little more than an hour, the performance took the audience on a rythmic yet a soothing journey, that left them wanting for more.
