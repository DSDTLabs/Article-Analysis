BENGALURU: Chaos prevailed when a mob claiming to be supporters of Congress   Muniratna   allegedly attacked JD(S) corporator Manjula Narayanaswamy near Laggere, Yeshwantpur in north Bengaluru. This was after Manjula said she'd complain to the CM about irregularities in the ward and within the MLA's jurisdiction.

 The incident occurred at 1.15pm on Friday after chief minister   and others, including Muniratna Naidu, left a venue at Laggere after inaugurating various civic projects.
 
 Video grabs from local TV channels showed a few men and women shouting 'MLA Muniratna Naidu-ge jai' (hail MLA Muniratna Naidu), attack Manjula Narayanaswamy and abuse her; at one point, the attackers were also seen trying to pull her sari.
 
 Police personnel present at the place rushed to the spot and dispersed the attackers and shifted the corporater to a safer place.
 
 Later, speaking to media, Manjula accused the Raja Rajeshwari Nagar MLA of abetting the attack. “I wanted to speak to the CM and reveal the irregularities taking place in the ward. When Muniratna saw me, he began shouting and wanted to know what I was doing at a   programme. Later, when I was speaking to others, an unruly mob attacked me,“ she said.
