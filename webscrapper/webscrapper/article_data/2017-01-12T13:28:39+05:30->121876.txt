For the Phogat sisters, who are revelling in the success of ‘Dangal, a film based on their journey and struggle, this is a transition from the wrestling akhada to the political akhada.

 The Meerut district administration has started a 12-day long voter awareness programme in the city that will culminate on January 22 with a three-kilometre long street painting competition and a   at Kailash Prakash Stadium, which will see participation of students from various city schools.
