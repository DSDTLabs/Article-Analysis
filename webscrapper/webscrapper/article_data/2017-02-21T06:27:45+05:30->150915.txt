New Delhi: The Centre has rejected the  's recommendation to amend election laws to permit 'totalising' of votes polled through electronic voting machines (EVMs) in different booths to camouflage area-wise voting pattern to prevent candidates from wreaking vengeance after polls. 

 Additional solicitor general   informed a bench of Chief Justice   and Justice D Y   and Justice   that a "team of ministers" headed by home minister   had examined the EC proposal and rejected it.
 
 "The EC had clarified that use of 'totaliser' could not be on experimental basis in select places since its deployment for the purpose too would need amendment in the relevant rules. The team of ministers has come to the conclusion that revelation of booth-wise votes polled by candidates would perhaps be more beneficial and useful since it would facilitate the candidates and the parties to find out the areas where they have shown better results and areas where they have not shown good results so as to work more for that area by bringing developmental activities to improve their performance in future elections," the ASG said, quoting the affidavit of the ministry of law and justice.
 
 "The team of ministers was of the view that the instance of intimidation/victimisation of voters as apprehended may not occur on a large scale in this era of media activism," the ASG said. "If any such incident takes place, then, in the present scenario of informed society, the same would be highlighted in the electronic and the print media as well as in social media which would adversely affect the parties' or candidates' performance in future elections," the Centre said.
