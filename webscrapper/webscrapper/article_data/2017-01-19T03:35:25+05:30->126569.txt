MUMBAI: With the   demanding one seat more in the BMC than the Shiv Sena—114 as against 113 in a 227-strong city hall—seat sharing talks have reached a deadlock, sources said. Talks were held at state education minister Vinod Tawde’s official residence on Wednesday.

 Should the BJP-Sena talks fail to rustle up an amicable seat-distribution formula, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is likely to go ahead and launch the party’s civic poll campaign on January 23 to mark Bal Thackeray’s birth anniversary, it is learnt.
 
 Matoshree is of the view that the BJP demand for one more seat in the BMC is a ploy to humiliate the Sena in Mumbai, which the party has been coveting as its stronghold for over four decades. “The whole idea is to demean us ahead of the Mumbai civic elections. Barring a few pocketboroughs, the BJP has never struck roots in Mumbai in the last three decades,” said a   legislator. 
 
 The BJP cites the 2014 state assembly poll results to substantiate its claim to have fared well in the city in the last two years. “We bagged 15 assembly seats in Mumbai in 2014, one seat more than the Sena. This should serve as the benchmark for the BMC polls too,” said a BJP functionary.
