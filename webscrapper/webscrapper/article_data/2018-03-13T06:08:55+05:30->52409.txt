BENGALURU: Starting this weekend, motorists heading to the   ( ) will have to   at the  . 

 Currently, motorists pay the   for both journeys when driving from the international airport to the city. Under the new system, motorists can pay one-way toll on their outward or return trips, or choose to pay on the first trip a cumulative toll which is valid for 24 hours.
 
 The move to collect toll in both directions comes in the wake of the opening of the alternative route via Hennur to the airport, which seems to have cut into the toll revenue at Sadahalli plaza. 
 
 Banners stating that the toll would be charged shortly from users while going to the airport are up at the collection plaza.
 
 
 
 
 Ever since the alternative route was opened, the toll revenue has fallen by 16%- 20%, and we must plug this leakage,” said YV Prasad, general manager, NHAI.
 
 He said they’ll have more toll lanes in both directions. “Commuters can pay toll in advance for both journeys. In the first trip itself, they can pay Rs 125 (four-wheelers), and won’t have to pay any amount on the way back. If it’s a one-way trip, they’ll have to pay Rs 85,” he said.
 
 Citizens, however, say it’ll cause traffic congestion both on the way to the airport and on the way back. Radhakrishna Holla, president, Bangalore Tourist Taxi Owners Association, said: “The alternative road has not been completed. Only 10% of taxis take thatroute.”
