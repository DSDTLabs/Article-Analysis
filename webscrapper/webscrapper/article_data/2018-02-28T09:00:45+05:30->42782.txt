NAGPUR: In a major relief for CBSE   students, the board has announced that students don’t have to pass theory and practical exams separately. As a special consideration only for the 2018 board exam, students will need to score an aggregate   in theory-practical combined to be declared successful. 

 The board chairman Anita Karwal announced that this is a “one-time measure” which is being taken because of the unique situation the Std X students come from. Karwal’s letter stated that “the current batch of Std X (2018) is coming from a different assessment background while they were in Std IX (2017)”. The exam committee of the board resolved to take this one-time measure in its last meeting. 
 
 This move is expected to help students tide over the sudden change in assessment criteria for the exams starting March 5. Till last year,   followed the Comprehensive and Continous Evaluation (CCE) system in which the board exams accounted for only 30% of the total   reflected in the mark sheet. There was increased focus on evaluation of students internally throughout the year. CCE was scrapped as authorities felt it could not achieve the purpose it was implemented for.
 
 The board has, however, clarified that this exemption won’t be applicable for vocational subjects listed in Annexure I (CBSE Notification of March 2017). 
 
 Karwal wrote, “There will be no exemption from the separate pass criteria as the internal assessment component of these subjects comprises 50 marks. In these subjects, mandatory separate pass criteria of securing 33% marks in both internal as well as board examination shall apply.”
