Vadodara/ Anand: Bones from a human skeleton found near a dustbin at near Pioneer crossroads created quite a stir in Anand on Monday night.  Large number of people had gathered at the crossroads after some locals noticed the bones that were dumped near a corner-side dustbin at the crossroads. The bones were first noticed by two women, who had gone to dump garbage inside the dustbin. As more number of people gathered, a local shopkeeper informed Anand police. Police rushed to the spot and noticed that the bones were lying wrapped inside a pillow cover near the dustbin.  “Some women informed me about the presence of bones in the area and hence I immediately alerted the police,” said Anup Mistry, who runs an art shop in the vicinity.  The cops seized the bones and sent them for forensic examination at Karamsad-based Shree Krishna Hospital to ascertain whether the skeleton belongs to a male or a female. “Since, we have noticed stains of red colour, prima facie it seems that the bones were used for some tantric ritual,” said an official, adding that the bones included skull cap, parts of legs, hands and spine of a human skeleton but all the parts were broken and were scattered.
