MUMBAI:   on Monday approached the   seeking   in the   case. The plea was mentioned before a division bench of Justices   and Burgess Colabawalla. The bench scheduled the application for hearing on January 31.

 Pune rural police had lodged an FIR against Ekbote for allegedly inciting a mob to commit violence in Koregoan Bhima on January 1, when Dalits were visiting the village to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the   battle. The protests against the violence had spread to other parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai. 
 
  Last week, a sessions court in Pune had refused to grant anticipatory bail to Ekbote saying the charges were serious. But Ekbote claimed that he was not present at the village at the time of the clashes; in fact, he was at his Pune home. He claimed he has been falsely implicated in the case and also denied making any inflammatory speeches.
