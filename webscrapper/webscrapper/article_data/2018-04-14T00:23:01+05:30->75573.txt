Environmentalists condemned the police action against the activists who tried to stop sand smuggling. Mohammed Saleem of the environment conservation group said it is obvious that there is political pressure behind these charges. “We condemn these baseless charges. These youths have brought to light the harsh reality. Instead of bringing the real culprits to book, police have attempted to clamp down on activists," Saleem fumed. "Every weekend youngsters are coming forward to clean the lake, river and save our natural resources. On the other hand, anti-socials are plundering the resources, which we will not allow. We will ensure that all these youngsters are let out free without any case. Otherwise, we environmentalists will join together and protest,” he said. K Mohanraj, a city-based environmentalist, said the intention of the public and youngsters who caught the sand truck is to stop illegal transportation of sand and to save our river. “That has to be kept in mind before filing any case against them. The intention of the authorities is in question now. It is the failure of the government that the activists are taking the law into their own hands. If the government its duty, we needn’t intercept the vehicles. The government stands exposed and the public should come and support the activists.” The collector should take action against the sand smugglers, he said. R Manikandan of Kovai Kulangal Paadhugaapu Amaippu said that whenever such instances take place, it is a big lesson for us. “If the youngsters had a heated argument or misbehaved with the driver, investigation can be held. But nobody can deny that it is the Noyyal river sand, and rampant smuggling is going on in the district. But if youngsters who are helping society are arrested then no one would come forward to do social service,” he said.
