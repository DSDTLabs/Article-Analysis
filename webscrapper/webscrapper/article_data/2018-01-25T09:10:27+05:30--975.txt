MADURAI: Summer is yet to set in but the city’s water woes have already begun. Residents of  , on Wednesday morning, blocked the zonal office in third zone demanding proper water supply.

 Secretary of the Anupandi Housing Board Residents Welfare Association, N R R   said that they were in one of the godforsaken wards of the  . “This housing board project with 4,500 plots was launched in the year 1991 and 4,000 of them are occupied now, but basic amenities like potable water and roads are still not available,” he said.
 
 When the scheme was started, it was under the panchayat and when the corporation took over in 2013, the residents thought that all their problems would end, but even after four years, they continue to suffer without water.
 
 When the water problem was at its peak in 2016, after many protests, the corporation assured the residents that water would be supplied in ten tankers for about 20,000 people in the housing board on a daily basis, but only four tankers have been bringing water since. 
 
 Most of the plots are small, about 330 sq feet in size while the bigger ones are just over 600 sq feet, hence laying bore wells is not possible in these houses, said residents. Some wells which were laid have run dry at a depth of over 700 feet. Gopi said that they had even tried testing the   in the ground water and found it to be non-potable as it ranged between 1,800 ppm and 2,200 ppm at many places. “These levels are not apt for even washing and we can survive only if the corporation gives us a proper water supply,” he said.
 
 Residents gave up the protest after corporation officers assured them that the number of tankers supplying water would be increased.
