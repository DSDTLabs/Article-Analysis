 "People are feeling cheated by the budget," he said, while speaking to reporters.
 
  legislative party leader,  , said that there was nothing for the youth and farmers in the budget.
 
  He accused the state government of not spending the funds of last budget fully. Verma said that the budget is largely driven by Central schemes and nothing new has been introduced by the state government.
 
 "Most of the allocations made are for Central schemes or the government is seeking central assistance. It seems that this government is surviving on the mercy of Lord Ram. It cannot work without the help from Centre," said  , president of   legislative party.
 
 He added that though   had come to power with a huge mandate but it has failed to address the concerns of youth and farmers. "There is no special package for potato farmers, there is nothing in budget that creates jobs, there is nothing in it that addresses security concerns," he said.
