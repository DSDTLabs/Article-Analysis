The first promo of filmmaker Tom Emmatty's upcoming movie   caught fans' attention, thanks to its catchy theme song and  ' intense avatar. We now got to know that the actor will be playing two characters in the movie.

 Tovino is no stranger to playing dual roles as the actor had starred as father and son in last year's Style. In the upcoming film, he would be portraying a campus leader of the past and one in the making.
 
 'The promo song is a flashback sequence set in the 70s in which I play a campus leader named Kochaniyan,' says Tovino. 'While Kochaniyan has only a few portions, most of the movie is set in 2004 featuring my character Paul. The latter is someone who joins college having no political inclination at all. But due to certain incidents, he enters campus politics and then becomes active.'
 
 The actor, who will next be seen playing a cop in Ezra, says that while the film will have 'an extended feel' of what the first teaser had promised, it also has all the elements of a campus movie. 'It shows the ups and downs of college and hostel life, the romance and friendships. The making is experimental and we have kept it as realistic as possible, while adding a few cinematic elements where required,' he says.
 
 Tovino also explains that the story is set in a campus that has a rich political atmosphere like Ernakulam Maharajas College, Thrissur Kerala Varma College or Trivandrum University College. 
 
 'The ambience in these colleges is very different from professional institutions. Many students here love reading, they are clear about their political ideologies, and exchanging love letters is very much part of their romances even now. So, technology has not corrupted that sense of nostalgia or innocence in these colleges. This movie reflects all of that,' says Tovino, who has also finished dubbing for Basil Joseph's film Godha.
