MIDNAPORE: A 39-year-old   fan was nabbed from his house in Aurobindo Nagar, Midnapore, for sending the former skipper death threats by post. Accused Nirmalya Samanta had written three such letters to Ganguly.

  Cops said Samanta’s house has pictures of him with Ganguly, one showing them shaking hands and another with them bursting crackers. 
 
  SP Bharti Ghosh said that the accused was nabbed after cops got a lead from a courier company, which delivered the letters to Ganguly’s residence. 
 
 According to sources, the accused was angry as the Midnapore representative for CAB — Garbeta MLA Asish Chakraborty — had invited Ganguly to Midnapore on January 19, even though he had no role to play in it. Ghosh, however, said, “Since the case is registered with  , we are handing him over to the anti rowdy squad.”
