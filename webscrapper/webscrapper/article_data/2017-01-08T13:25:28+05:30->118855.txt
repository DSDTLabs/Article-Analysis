 In a statement issued on Saturday, DMK working president M K Stalin has demanded that the state government form a special committee to conduct a probe into the irregularities in TNAU and to take steps to get back the accreditation. "It is a sad state of affairs that TNAU, the first agricultural university in the country has lost its accreditation," said Stalin. "The special committee should consist of senior academics. And action should be taken based on their recommendations," he said.
 
 Stalin said that the university has lost its ICAR accreditation for various reasons, including random transfers of senior administration officers. "Many important administrative posts like registrar, controller of examinations, college principles and directors of various departments are held by people only in-charge," said Stalin.
 
 The leader 'expressed sadness' that even though there were 50 AIDMK MPs in New Delhi, no initiatives had been taken to get back accreditation. "The AIADMK has to take responsibility for the sad state of affairs in TNAU," he said.
 
 Tamil Nadu Agricultural University vice chancellor K Ramasamy said that the ICAR accreditation would be allotted to the university by the end of January. 
 
 The university has not had ICAR accreditation since 2009. "It was never mandatory under the ICAR. However, we applied for it in June 2016, and October 2016 a review committee visited the university. Some clarifications were sought by the experts which were submitted in November 2016," Ramasamy said.
