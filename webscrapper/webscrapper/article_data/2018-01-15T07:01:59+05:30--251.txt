KOLKATA: When former footballer   was told that he had colon  , the world seemed to be crumbling around him. A chill went down his spine and his feet felt unsteady. But then Banerjee, who loves to call himself a fighter, raced his mind back to the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan IFA Shield final clash of 1964. Leading the red-and-gold brigade from the front against a formidable Bagan line-up that had the legendary Chuni Goswami in its ranks, Banerjee’s side managed to finish the game with honours. If he could defy his opponents on the football ground, why couldn’t he confront cancer, he asked himself.

 “I never felt shaky after those first few moments. Over the last seven years, I have gone through five cycles of chemotherapy and now am cured. I feel fine and lead a normal life just as I would before the disease had struck,” said the 82-year-old who hates to call himself a cancer survivor. “You don’t refer to a malaria patient as a survivor but it’s a killer ailment, too. Why single out cancer?” he asks.
 
 Around a dozen like Banerjee, who have refused to be cowed down by the terminal ailment and have come up trumps, gathered at   in Kolkata on the occasion of World Cancer Day. They shared their stories, egged each other on and urged everyone not to treat them differently. For many of them, life didn’t end with cancer, but, in fact, took a turn for the better.
 
 While Banerjee fought the Big C with a doughty spirit and proper treatment, not many are as fortunate. “Only two in five cancer patients in India receive some form of treatment, including palliative care. This gap is unacceptable, and is the biggest challenge to treatment,” says Chennai-based oncologist Dr V Shanta, chairperson of Adyar Cancer Institute.
