KOLKATA: The ‘Mishti’ hub in New Town will be thrown open to public in a few weeks’ time. Seven reputable brands have already been given space and several others have evinced interest.

 The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) is giving the finishing touches to the ‘Mishti’ hub. “Seven established brands, including Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, Nalin Chandra Das, Ganguram Sweets and K C Das, have agreed to open shops at the hub,” said a   official.
 
 One of the conditions for participating in the bid is that the shops will have to be in operation for 25 years or more.
 
 Apart from branded sweet outlets, there will be a special counter displaying various kinds of traditional Bengali sweet, including Saktigarh’s ‘lyangcha’, Burdwan’s ‘sitabhog’ and ‘mihidana’, Berhampore’s ‘chhanabora’ and Krishnagore’s ‘sarpuria’ and ‘sarbhaja’.
 
 The hub is being set up on the Biswa Bangla Sarani on way to the airport on the VIP Road-bound flank located near Gate number 3 of   on the left.
 
 There’s an old Kolkata charm in the overall look of the hub, said an official. There is a central atrium with glass walls. The official said there will be one counter each for the branded sweet outlets.
