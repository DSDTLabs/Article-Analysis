CHENNAI: Late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s nephew Deepak and niece Deepa approached the Madras high court seeking letters that would authorise them to administer the intestate properties of Jayalalithaa including   in  . The petition may be taken up next week.

 The children of Jayalalithaa’s brother Jayakumar moved court claiming that they are the second class legal heirs as per the Hindu Succession Act, and entitled to inherit the properties of the former chief minister, who died on on December 5, 2016 without leaving a will. According to the petitioners, they had approached the jurisdictional tahsildar on August 16, 2017 requesting him to issue legal heir certificate in their favour to inherit the properties.
 
 But through a reply dated September 22, the tahsildar refused to issue the certificates and directed the petitioners to obtain the certificate by approaching the appropriate civil court. Claiming that there is no other surviving legal heir of Jayalalithaa, the duo said, “Due and diligent search has been made for a will but none was found.” They approached the court seeking to issue letters of administration in their favour.
 
 They have also filed an exhaustive list of gold ornaments and precious stones, apart from immovable properties owned by the former CM worth Rs 52.93 crore, with an undertaking to duly administer the properties, making a full and true inventory thereof and exhibit it before the court within six months from grant of letters of administration, and to render true account of the properties and credits within a year. 
 
 The plea moved under the testamentary and intestate jurisdiction of the high court is likely to be taken up for hearing next week.
