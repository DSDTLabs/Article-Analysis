MUMBAI: Even though some of them are flush with money, several state units of the Indian cricket board ( ) have been an unhappy lot ever since the   stopped their funding from the parent body till they implemented the Lodha reforms in toto. The latest to claim that they've a problem is the   (SCA), which has asked the Board to release funds so that it can pay match fees to its players at all levels for the domestic season.

 In a letter to BCCI CEO   (TOI has a copy of it), which has been copied to members of the SC-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) and senior BCCI officials and all state associations, SCA joint secretary   wrote on Saturday: “This is with reference to pending and much overdue reimbursements of funds from BCCI to our association. Payments to all the players who've played in matches of domestic tournaments of the BCCI haven't been paid so far. We see no reason for BCCI not sending funds to make necessary payments to all the men and women players who've represented their respective associations in domestic tournaments, including the most important and prestigious Ranji Trophy.
 
 “The fees of these players is paid by the BCCI. We believe that the SC hasn't given any such guidelines of not paying or delaying due payments to all these domestic players. We request you to take up this matter urgently.”
 
 Other than this, the SCA has also asked the Board to ensure “timely payment” of Rs 1.5 crore (as staging fees due to the host association) for staging five IPL-10 games this season at its stadium in Rajkot. “Also please refer to our letter on March 2 requesting for ensuring and confirming timely payment of Rs 30 lakh per IPL match, as per the agreement between the BCCI, staging association and the franchise. There're five IPL matches at our SCA Stadium between April 7 and 29. We had raised the same issue in the IPL meeting of state associations.”
