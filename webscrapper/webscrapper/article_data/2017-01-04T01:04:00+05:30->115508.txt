Mumbai: With the BMC elections approaching, BJP is tried to score over Shiv Sena on the ‘son-of-the-soil’ issue in the film industry. The   skill development department has joined hands with art director Nitin Desai, who is known to be close to Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, to train Marathi youths in the jobs required in the film industry. Under the agreement signed with Desai, 6,000 youngsters will be trained in the next three years.

 The cost of training will be borne by the state government and the industry-partner. “The priority will be given to Marathi and local youths in this initiative,” skill development minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar told TOI. The courses include film and stage-related trades ranging from film editing, art direction, carpentry, masonry and other skills. “With changing times we have identified new trades that are in demand. We are training youths that are needed in the market,” he added.
