CHENNAI: Search panels appointed to shortlist candidates for vicechancellors (VC) position should be given a time frame to complete the process, and the state government should be directed to bring out specific enforceable norms for the purpose, a PIL filed in Madras high court said.

 A vacation bench comprising Justice   and Justice M Govindaraj, before which the PIL was filed by activist A Narayanan, director of  , came up for hearing on Thursday, issued notice to the government, and posted the matter after summer vacation for further hearing.
 
 Listing the universities running without VCs for a long time, the PIL said   does not have a vice-chancellor for almost a year since the tenure of previous VC came to an end on May 26, 2016. Madras University is without a head since January 2016. There is no VC, registrar and controller of examination at  , which does not even have an additional controller of examination, Narayanan said. In the case of  , its first VC demitted office on March 19, 2016, and a search committee was constituted on August 11, 2016, after a delay of nearly five months.
 
 Vacancies of such top acade mic positions hamper effective functioning of the universities, resulting in considerable delay even in conducting viva voce for research students. Unrest and anxiety are building up among faculties, research scholars and students of these universities, the PIL said, adding: “Many administrative matters, affiliation, research projects, recognition to new courses, financial allocation and other such crucial issues are piling up for want of leadership and direction.“
 
 Noting that several representations to authorities on the matter had not evoked any response, the PIL wanted the court to direct the state to come out with an enforceable norms for selection of vicechancellors within a time frame.
