When it comes to giving her social media fans a peek at her personal life, one may not find   saying “hello from the other side” but the actress did quite the contrary recently. 

 
 
  
 The pop-sensation was watching the 89th   on her home theatre system and couldn't help gushing over close pal  's big win at the Oscars. 
  
 Stone walked away with the Best Actress award for her performance in  's Best Picture nominated 'La La Land'. Adele, who watched all the action unfold from the comfort of her home, took to her   to share an amazing post saying, "Ah   ❤️
 And Moonlight, congratulations so so wonderful." 
  
 Adele and Stone, both 28 years old, have been friends for quite some time.
