Loved the jodi of on-screen brothers   and   in one of Bollywood’s cult movies ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’? Well, guess what, the duo will be seen reuniting on the big screen yet again.

 Now we are not quite sure whether it is going to be for a movie or a commercial or a web series or something else, but we are excited like a baby who just learnt how to walk on his own. Rishi Kapoor took to Twitter to announce this collaboration, and his excitement reflected ours in every possible way.
 
  
 Rishi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan have worked in several blockbusters of their times, which include ‘Naseeb’, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ and ‘Kabhie Kabhie’. There was a fantasy movie ‘Ajooba’ where their collaboration failed to impress the audience and so the film tanked at the box-office.
 
 This announcement has, in fact, made us wonder as to why yesteryears stars have never been paired up together on the big screen? We are not asking for sequels, but making a movie with such phenomenal actors sharing a screen space would be absolutely fantastic. Do you agree?
