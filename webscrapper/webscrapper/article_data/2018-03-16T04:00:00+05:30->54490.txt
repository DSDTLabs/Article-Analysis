Mumbai: ICICI Bank’s Rs 4,017-crore initial public offer comprising an offer for sale of its 24% stake in its broking arm,  , will open on March 22 and close on March 26.

 The lender is offering just under 8 crore shares to the public, which includes 5% reserved for the bank’s shareholders.   has fixed a narrow price range of Rs 519-520 per share, which has a face value of Rs 5. This values the company at Rs 16,750 crore.
 
 The pricing is a significant markdown from the valuation at the time of filing the draft prospectus in November, when the bank had valued it’s arm at Rs 25,000. A correction in markets has compelled the bank to revise its pricing for the country’s largest broking company.
 
 Speaking at the launch of the issue, ICICI Bank MD   said this was a continuation of the lender’s plans to list its subsidiaries, the process for which began a year and half ago. ICICI Bank has already listed its life and non-life arm but is yet to list its mutual fund arm.
 
 “India is seeing a shift in savings from physical to financial assets. Demonetisation and GST are propelling formalisation of the economy and low interest rates will channelise savings into equities” said Kochhar.
 
 According to ICICI Securities MD Shilpa Kumar, the company is a pure-play agency on savings across assets and a pioneer in online broking in India. “Only 60% of our revenues is from broking and 10% of our revenues is from investment banking. Of the remaining 30%, half comes from distribution of MFs and the rest from insurance and other products,” said Kumar.
 
 ICICI Securities had reported a net profit of Rs 398 crore for the nine months ended December 2017 as compared to Rs 254 crore in the same period of the previous year.
