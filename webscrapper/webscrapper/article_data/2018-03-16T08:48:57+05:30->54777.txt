CHANDIGARH: Even as the Central government is eyeing to achieve 100% scientific processing and disposal of solid waste by 2019, Chandigarh municipal corporation is lagging far behind in waste management.

 The report of Centre’s standing committee on urban development paints a dismal picture of solid waste management in the UT, which is vying to become a smart city.
 
 Nine months after the launch of segregation of waste at source project, the MC is struggling to effectively implement the system.
 
 Of the 26 wards, only five have executed the system cent percent, says the report.
 
 The MC had distributed free of cost around 2.50-lakh dustbins, two per house, after UT administrator V P   launched the project with much fanfare on June 5 last year. It had cost the civic body around Rs 2 crore. But after the residents blamed small size of dustbins and untrained sanitation workers for the system not picking up in city, the MC asked them to buy their own bins.
 
 Regular segregation of dry and wet waste is a key parameter in the Swachh Survekshan, 2018.
 
 Holding MC responsible for the lukewarm response, Federation of Sectors’ Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) general secretary   said the corporation tried to force the system on residents without taking them in confidence. “The MC should run an awareness campaign and involve residents. Segregation of waste at source is good, but it should be done in a proper manner,” Gogia added.
 
 As per the report, 462 tonne of municipal solid waste is generated daily and 168,630 tonne per annum in Chandigarh. Of the total, only 30% is being processed, while the remaining is thrown at the dumping ground, the report adds.
 
 Chandigarh has 100% doorto-door collection in all the 26 wards.
