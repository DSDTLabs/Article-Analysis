NEW DELHI: Delhi University has issued dates of only five cutoff lists this year, as they are hoping that colleges will avoid “unreasonable” cutoffs. This, they say has been done to avoid the admission process going on for long. However, a special centralised   session has been planned to fill the SC, ST, OBC   left  , if over 90% of the overall seats get filled after the fifth list.

 
 The admission process at DU often go on for long as colleges come out with several cutoff lists to fill their seats. Often the first three cutoffs are very high and the subsequent reduction is minimal. 
 
 “We are hoping that the cutoffs stay limited to the fifth list. If over 90% of admissions are done by then, a drive will be conducted to fill the remaining seats. If not, we will release new cutoff lists,” a senior DU official said.
 
 While the problem of too many cutoff lists make the admission process lengthy, there is the other problem where most of the time the SC, ST, OBC seats lie vacant till the tenth cutoff list is out. For this, the centralised special drive for the reserved categories after the fifth cutoff list will be announced.
 
 Under this, reserved category students would be invited by DU and encouraged to apply for the courses that may have vacancies in their courses.
 
 “Earlier, DU would have these special drives for students of the reserved categories too. Last year, they came out with two specific cutoffs to fill about 1,500 seats in various colleges,” a member of the standing committee for admissions told TOI.
 
 The member explained that earlier colleges would hold the drives at their respective campuses. “However, this year DU will conduct the programme in a centralised manner instead of colleges doing it separately. Students will be given admission ‘on the spot’ to their choice for courses in colleges that have vacancies.”
