AHMEDABAD: The recent spate of atrocities against dalits in   seems to show no sign of abating, triggering widespread outrage across the nation.

 On Saturday , Khema Parmar, a   man from Patan district, lodged a police complaint stating that he and three of his family had been thrashed by members of the   community on the last day of   in Ganget village. Parmar said the attackers had been angered by the presence of Dalit women at a garba event.
 
 On Sunday , a 21-year-old Dalit man, Jayesh Solanki, was lynched for watching garba at his village, Bhadraniya, in Anand district. On September 27 and 29, two youths were beaten up by a group Patels at Limbodara village in   district for sporting moustaches. In July 2016, a video of four Dalit men being flogged in Una went viral. The victims were publicly thrashed with batons for skinning a dead cow. That outrage shook the nation's conscience. Even so, attacks on Dalits have spiked in the run-up to the Gujarat assembly polls.
 
 In the Patan village case, the FIR states that Siddharth Parmar (17), his father Gautam Parmar (42), his uncle Khema Parmar (47) and his grandfather Varva Parmar (65) were beaten up by some members of the Patel community on September 29. Before the attack, tension had erupted over Dalit women attending the garba event near a temple. The four victims are being treated at Dharpur civil hospital in Chanasma taluka, Patan. Parthrajsinh Gohil, incharge SP of Patan, said the case was being investigated by a dy superintendent of SCST cell, CN Chaudhari.
