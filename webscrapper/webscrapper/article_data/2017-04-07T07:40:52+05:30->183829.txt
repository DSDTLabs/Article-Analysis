THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after a woman employee of a regional news channel filed a complaint of sexual harassment against   leader and former minister A K Saseendran, the police have not yet registered a case against him. 

 The woman had filed the petitions before the chief judicial magistrate here as well as the state police chief on Wednesday alleging that Saseendran made sexual advances towards her when she met him for an interview and also continued to sexually harass her over phone. 
 
 Senior officials in the police department ruled out any action from their part until the magistrate takes a decision on the petition filed before him. The case has been posted for further hearing on April 15. 
 
 The police have not yet been able to get the custody of the channel CEO   and senior journalist   for further investigation in connection with the case on telecasting the sleaze talk allegedly involving A K Sassendran. Though the magistrate had earlier posted the case to consider the custody application on Thursday, it was deferred to Friday. 
 
 Besides Ajithkumar and Jayachandran, the police had also arrested three other senior employees of the channel-M B Santhosh, S V Pradeep and Firoze Saly Mohammed. All of them are currently in judicial custody in district jail. 
 
 Their arrests were recorded on Tuesday after a marathon 13-hour interrogation found that they were directly involved in telecasting the sleaze tape, which cost Saseendran his berth in the cabinet.
