 An old picture of his recently surfaced on the net which set the tongues wagging. In the picture in question, he looks nothing like what he looks now. He looks like a chubby teenager, posing with his sister. It's nothing like his current chiseled self. Take a look at the picture here:
 
  
  
 
 One of the most good-looking contestants of the show, Priyank boasts of a huge number of followers.

 Just recently he was moved to tears when he was proposed by a fan on Propose Day.
 
  
 He has taken to his Instagram to share the video, captioned as: "And she made the entire jury panel cry today along with me. I just wanna thank you for the kind of emotion you have for me and to all the people who have the mutual feelings. I just feel a little bad that I fail to reply each one of you since it’s next to impossible for me. But just want to tell you all and the entire family of mine that I am really thankful to all of you. Without you guys I ain’t anything! It just makes me nostalgic right now, I LOVE YOU GUYS whatever I am becoming and reaching is because of you guys."
