BHOPAL:   minister Jayant Mallaya tabled a Rs 5,052.53 crore first supplementary budget in the MP assembly on Tuesday. He said Rs 580 crore has been provisioned for the onion purchase.

 Leader of opposition Ajay Singh termed it a ‘wastage’ of public money and alleged the onion purchase was a huge scam. “Onion is stinking in the whole state. Besides, in Pipariya mandi alone, a scam of Rs 100 crore has taken place in the purchase of pulses,” he alleged.
 
 Addressing the assembly, finance minister Jayant Mallaya said Rs 559 crore for PM Awas Yojana, Rs 76.91 crore for the ongoing expansion of the Mantralaya and Rs 700 crore for smart city schemes have also been provisioned in the budget among others.
 
 He said that Rs 40 crore has been sanctioned in the first supplementary for the Rs 1,000 crore agriculture price stabilization fund. The remaining funds would be sanctioned separately, he said.
 
 Referring to a better economic management in BJP government, he said that when the Congress was in power in 2003, the debt amount was 33.74 % of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) which has now been lowered to just 19.66 %.
 
 He said, “the debt on the government hardly matters because our government is spending on infrastructure, education, health, power, irrigation and on the welfare of the people.”
 
 The FM said the per capita income in 2003-04 was Rs 8,234 which has increased seven folds and now stands at Rs 59,052.
 
 Earlier, the leader of the opposition criticised the budget provisions and said that most of the government money was wasted in publicising and projecting the image of chief minister. Whenever the chief minister makes some announcements, his hoardings are installed.
 
 A huge amount was spent in Namami Devi narmade yatra. The house was informed that the government had spent Rs 21 crore on its advertisement. His hoardings were even installed in New York and Los Angeles.
