LAHAR (BHIND): Sixteen months before the next assembly polls,   sensing an opportunity set its campaign rolling with a farmers’ rally in Lahar assembly constituency of Bhind district on Monday. The rally spot, 100 km from Gwalior and just one km from the   border raised the issue of killings in Mandsaur police firing and farmers’ suicides in the state.

 Midst cheers from the 50,000 odd farmers gathered, Congress promised if voted to power in December 2018, it will be a form a government committed for uplift of “farmers, poor, Dalits and OBCs”. Congress said it wants to be back in power so it can give free “single-bulb” power connections to the poor and free electricity for up to five horse-power pumps to farmers. 
 
 The rally marked the conclusion of 10-day Kisan Swabhimaan Yatra which was started on July 1 in every district and block-level to reach-out to farmers, who the Congress feels is angry after the Mandsaur firing.
 
 “Hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi started a fight for farmers from Champaran,” Congress’ chief whip in the Lok Sabha Jyotiraditya Scindia said addressing the large gathering. “The Mahatma made the oppressive rulers of those times to bow down.”
 
 He said farmers in the state today are also feeling oppressed, exploited and punished and there must be a fresh fight for them. “Not because I am part of a political party, but as a citizen I feel that June 6 when farmers’ were gunned down in Mandsaur should be observed as a black day,” Scindia said. “What was the fault of those slain farmers? Only that they asked for their rights from the government?”
 
 Scindia argued that instead of asking for forgiveness from the families of slain farmers, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on a fast.
