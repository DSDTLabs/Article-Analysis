BHOPAL: A tiger cub was rescued from a dry well in a village near   in   district on Sunday. The cub was trapped in the well - located in the buffer zone of the protected area - for almost 24 hours, before being rescued in the evening, said sources. Villagers saw the tiger cub in afternoon and informed the authorities.

 A rescue team comprising staff of the national park, swung into action after forest officials alerted them, sources said. Officials lowered a wooden log inside the well and the cub escaped on its own, said an officer.
 
 "Any delay in the rescue operations would have proved disastrous for the cub," said an officer. Park officials have begun a search for its mother to ensure the safety of other cubs as well. This year had turned out to be hellish for tigers in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 A tiger cub was found dead in   on Monday, taking the death toll of big cats in the state to seven in January alone. In the last 13 months, 34 tigers have perished in the state. On Republic Day, a full-grown tiger was found dead in a farm in   district, possibly electrocuted by an illegal wire trap.
