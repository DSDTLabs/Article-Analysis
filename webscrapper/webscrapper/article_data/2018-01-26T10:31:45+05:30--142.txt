PUDUCHERRY: The opposition   party has decided to boycott the reception to be hosted by lieutenant governor   as part of the Republic Day celebrations on January 26, to register their protest against her ‘undemocratic and dictator style of functioning’ in the Union territory.

 Speaking to reporters on Thursday, AIADMK legislature party leader A   termed Bedi’s activities bypassing the elected government as detrimental to democracy in the country.
 
 “She (Bedi) is insulting the cabinet and elected members. She blocks the projects and schemes that have been evolved based on government’s policies and have been announced in the annual budget. She spreads false information about the government, ministers and elected members,” Anbalagan charged. 
 
 He regretted that the   government has become a mere spectator. He said the AIADMK participated in an all-party meeting convened by the ruling   last year despite its arch rival DMK attending the meet. 
 
 “The all-party meeting had resolved to form a delegation and meet the President and Prime Minister on the issue (Bedi’s interference in administration). The ruling party did not take any initiative for a year. Chief minister ( ) has now again declared that he will lead a delegation,” said Anbalagan.
