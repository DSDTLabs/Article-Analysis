KOCHI: The high court has sought the views of the   on a petition questioning acquittal of priest Jose   in Sister   case. 

 
 The court was considering a petition filed by  , who was the convener of the action council in the case, questioning a CBI special court's decision on March 7 this year. The plea alleges that the court acquitted the priest though witness statements and circumstantial evidence were available against him.
 
 The court had held that prosecution failed to bring out sufficient materials to proceed against Jose Poothrikkayil. A discharge plea filed by the priest along with first accused and priest Thomas M Kottoor and third accused Sister Sephy was considered by the CBI court.
 
 Materials produced do not show that Poothrikkayil was at St Pius X Convent hostel on the date of occurrence of the crime and there is no other evidence to show his involvement in the crime, the CBI court had said. However, the court had said available evidence shows the character of the priest, who was found scaling the wall of the convent a few days before the death of Sister Abhaya.
 
 Challenging Poothrikkayil's acquittal, the petitioner has alleged that the CBI court failed to appreciate the evidence against the priest properly. The statement of the witness who found the deceased's body was against the priest. Similarly, a thief who entered the convent on the night of the crime had deposed that he saw two persons, the petition said.
 
 Further hearing is scheduled on June 7.
