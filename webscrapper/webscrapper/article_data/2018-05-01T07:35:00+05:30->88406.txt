Amritsar: A nine-year-old girl was found dead under suspicious circumstances at Dhardeo village on Monday. Police have constituted a medical board after parents of the hapless girl expressed suspicion of the girl being raped and later killed. However, police maintain that the girl’s neck was found entangled in the chains of a swing, which led to her death.

 Father of the girl said that he lived in Mansa whereas his daughter had arrived in Dhardeo to live with his sister-in-law for the past 15 days. He said that he saw some marks on the girl’s neck, following which he approached the Chowk Mehta police and expressed suspicion that the girl might have been raped and then killed. Amrirsar (rural) SSP Parampal Singh said that the girl’s body was found entangled in the chains of a swing. However, he said, a medical board had been constituted to check out any possibility of rape.
