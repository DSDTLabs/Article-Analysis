KOLKATA: Dark, unmonitored suburban platforms in the state, considered potential crime spots, may soon become a thing of the past with   (ER) planning to bring all its 220 stations under CCTV cover by the end of 2017. Besides, 16 non-suburban stations will also be brought under the plan.

 “Contracts have been awarded under the Integrated Security System (ISS) to set up CCTV cameras for surveillance. Wiring work has started. Initially, there were plans to instal cameras at 11 stations but now, another 236 stations, including all the 220 suburban stations in the Howrah and Sealdah divisions, will get CCTV cameras under Nirbhaya Fund,” announced V K Dhaka, IG, Railway Protection Force (RPF) and chief security commissioner, ER, on Friday. 
 
 The   (SER) has also started installing cameras at suburban stations. According to  , CPRO, SER, cameras have been installed at 12 stations and 10 will be set up at Left Wing Extremism (LWE) districts. “Thirty-three more stations will get cameras from Nirbhaya Fund,” Ghosh said. 
 
 The IG pointed out that the 182 security helpline had been effective, particularly for women. From fewer than a single a day in 2015, RPF control rooms now receive four calls a day on an average. “For any distress call, our personnel attend to the caller at the very next station. If there is an escort party on the  , it jumps to help immediately. We have addressed over 400 complaints in ER areas. There have been people seeking medical assistance or asking to trace their missing bags. Our officers also help lodge complaints with the GRP. Initially, we had one line per control room, now, we have three,” Dhaka added.
 
 The RPF and GRP now escort 334 ER mail/express trains from 6pm to 6am.
