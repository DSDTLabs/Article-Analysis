RANCHI: Acting Chief Justice of   high   Justice D N   on Sunday said disposal rate of cases in the has increased by 51.3% but insisted that performance of judges needs to improve further.

 "The total of number of cases pending before the Jharkhand high court is 3,42,768. In the last one year, 1,54,585 cases were filed while 1,57,000 were disposed of. This means, out of every 100 cases filed, the judiciary disposed of 102 and this was achieved with much lesser judges in office than the actual requirement," Justice Patel said at a function organized to distribute appointment letters to 40 new judicial officers (probationers) at the JHALSA building.
 
 Chief minister  , judges and officers of the Jharkhand high court and senior officers from the bureaucracy were present on the occasion.
 
 Justice Patel said if each judge increases his performance by 5% it would make a huge impact on the disposal rate. "The disposal rate must be increased to 125 for every 100 cases filed," he said.
 
 Pointing out that special drives were going on to dispose of sensitive cases more than five years old or disputes related to the Negotiable Instruments Act, Justice Patel said the strength of judiciary will increase to 556 by the end of 2018 but it is still far less than the requirement. He said there should be examination for appointment of judges every year. The vacancy in the judiciary has accrued due to want of examination every year, Justice Patel said.
