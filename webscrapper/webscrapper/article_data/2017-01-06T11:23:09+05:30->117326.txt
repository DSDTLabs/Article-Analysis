PUNE: A section of   (PCB) members and officials have accused the   of   in implementing   on  . The allegations have been refuted by the cops. 

 Quite a few roads in the Cantonment limits have been turned into 'one-way' owing to their narrow width. This has resulted in more travelling time for commuters. 
 
 The most contentious of these restrictions is at the Golibar Maidan crossing where vehicles coming from Swargate are only allowed to take a left towards Castellino Road. This leads to longer travelling time for vehicles travelling to Kondhwa and beyond.
 
 "It is important that the right turn from Golibar Maidan should not be allowed since the end of the Kondhwa Road at the intersection is narrow," a senior traffic officer said, while dismissing claims of inconvenience to motorists.
 
 PCB members said there are schools on Castellino Road and students here often suffer accidents because of heavy traffic. "We requested the traffic department to at least let vehicles take a right turn to Kondhwa Road to reduce traffic on Castellino Road, but it has not cooperated with us in this regard," Atul Gaikwad, a PCB member, said.
