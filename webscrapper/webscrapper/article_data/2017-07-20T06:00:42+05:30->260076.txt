HYDERABAD: Look for a 'bakra' to have a safe journey back home whenever you are drunk. This was a tongue in cheek advice of   actor   on Wednesday during a mega   conducted by city police for college students. His reference was, in a lighter vein, to a teetotaller, who could be relied for driving home friends after a party. 

 At a packed auditorium in  , actor Allu Arjun and director Raja Mouli got a rousing reception. Students were in raptures when Arjun started speaking about the importance of safe and responsible driving. He recalled his scary experience when his speeding car on a rainy day almost killed a pregnant woman. 
 
 "I had a disagreement with a female friend. She left the restaurant in a huff. To keep up with her car, I went at high speed. I could not notice another car in the rain. I applied sudden brakes but I rammed into the car. I apologised to the elderly man driving the car and offered to pay for damages. Seconds later, a pregnant woman emerged from the car,'' Arjun told the students. Raja Mouli too appealed to students not to drive recklessly.
