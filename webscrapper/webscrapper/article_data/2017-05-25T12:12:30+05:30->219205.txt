GUWAHATI: Chief minister   has hailed Major   as the 'pride of Assam' for his 'acts' in Kashmir that earned him the Army chief's   for sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations and asked every Indian soldier to emulate him. 

 "Yes, this is a great service to the nation. We are proud of him. I believe every Indian soldier should put in efforts for the cause of the country like Major Gogoi did," Sonowal said on Wednesday, which marked the completion of his first year in office as the chief minister. Sonowal and Gogoi both hail from Dibrugarh district - the CM is from Chabua and Gogoi from Namrup.
 
 Major Gogoi shot to limelight and subsequently got embroiled in a controversy over an incident where he allegedly ordered that a Kashmiri man be tied on the hood of a jeep as a shield against stone-pelters.
 
 Finance and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, former CM Tarun Gogoi and hundreds of others on the social media have poured their hearts out in praise of the young officer's heroics. Sarma twitted, "Proud of Major Leetul Gogoi of #Assam getting Army Chief's Commendation Card for sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations. The Army chief's 'Commendation Card' is considered a prestigious award and is given for distinguished services and devotion to duty. #Pride #Assam"
 
 Former CM Gogoi, too, twitted on the same lines, "Congratulations to Major Leetul Gogoi for being awarded with Chief of Army Staff's Commendation Card."
 
 Some in the social media described Major Gogoi's act as one that 'saved many soldiers and civilians without spraying a single bullet', while others equated him with Ahom general   who had stopped the Mughals from entering this part of the country. Eighteen years ago, Captain   of Golaghat had sacrificed his life fighting Pakistani intruders in Kargil on June 30, 1999.
