Vijayawada: The terror   on   pilgrims in Anantnag on Monday, which left seven dead and 21 injured, has not deterred the pilgrims who have chosen to continue with the yatra. 

 Every year thousands of   undertake the Amarnath yatra to see the sacred Shivalingam, which can be seen only in the Hindu month of Shravan, which falls somewhere between June and August. “We believe that visiting the Shivalingam of Lord Shiva in Amarnath completes our lives and our sins are forgiven. These are the reasons why people enrol for the yatra,” said a piligrim M Nagaraju, who is visiting Amarnath for the second time.
 
 In the past, several people from the two Telugu states have weathered difficulties during their visit. Some have been injured, while some have lost their lives. But nothing could compel them to cancel their trip. According to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB) officials, more than 10,000 pilgrims from Andhra Pradesh and close to 8,000 from Telangana visit the shrine every year. This year the annual yatra to the holy shrine commenced on June 29.
