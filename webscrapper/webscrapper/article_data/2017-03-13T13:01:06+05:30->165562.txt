NOIDA: The UP Police’s twitter handle @Uppolice extended   wishes to people on Monday and it was full of colours. In some witty messages, it warned ‘hooligans’ of what police would do if they break the rules.

 “Molesting a girl on Holi will invite police faster than Pizza and treat for you in jail,” the   said one tweet.
 
 
  
 
 In another tweet, the Police gave a puzzle and also the answer. “A drunkard, a molester, an abuser are in the same car. Imagine who is driving the car? A police officer,” the tweet is hashtaged by Holi and Uppolice.
 
 
  
 In a previous tweet, they advised people to burn evil ideas and ill-will this Holi and spread the message of love.
