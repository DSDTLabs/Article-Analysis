I have been told to be more feminine by well meaning people. I wasted many years trying to be who I am not in my effort to fit in. I don't know why the world is after making you fit in to a category. Be You and stop fulfilling people's expectations of you to look busty, assy, fair, thin, shy, masked with make up. You can either live for yourself or for the world. Use your power to Choose..."
