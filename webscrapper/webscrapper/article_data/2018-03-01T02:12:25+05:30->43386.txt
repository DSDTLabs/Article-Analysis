Puducherry: Appreciating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concern that the people of   are being deprived of their democratic right by not conducting  , former Lok Sabha MP M   asked lt governor Kiran Bedi and chief minister V Narayanasamy to take steps to hold the polls at the earliest. 
 
 “It is gratifying that a matter of great public and constitutional importance was highlighted by the Prime Minister in his short address. The ruling class, irrespective of their political affiliation, is averse to the very existence of elected local bodies, which explains them not holding local body elections for 38 years since 1968. It was only after the pressure from the Parliament and court intervention, that elections were held with great reluctance,” Ramadass said in a statement. 
  
 “But even then the constitutionally mandated functions, functionaries and funds were not devolved to these bodies by the government. After 2011, elections were not held for seven years and local bodies are now kept in animated suspension,” he said. 
  
 He said the Prime Minister must have questioned the ‘democratic spirit’ of Bedi and sought an explanation from her (administrator) for dereliction of duty before launching a tirade against the Congress government. 
  
 He also said Narayanasamy cannot shirk the responsibility by shifting the blame to the case pending before the Supreme Court. 
  
 He pointed out that the case was filed by the government and suggested it to withdraw the case by assuring the court that it will ensure OBC reservation based on the statistics available with the Puducherry Backward Classes Committee.
