MUMBAI:   on Thursday told agencies probing the killing of activists   and   not to shy away from taking help of experts and using latest technology to nab the absconding accused. 

 "As a probing agency, you have to outsmart them," said a bench headed by Justice S C Dharmadhikari, adding that when crimes like these go undetected, others (criminals) feel emboldened, and this leads to a spurt in crime. The court, on a plea by their families, is monitoring the probe by CBI in the killing of Dabholkar and an SIT of Maharashtra police in Pansare's case.
 
 Dabholkar was shot on August 20, 2013, in Pune, while Pansare was shot at on February 16 in Kolhapur and died on February 20, 2015. Submitting a report on behalf of SIT, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi said "a lot of progress has been made'' and certain names were disclosed. "More people are identified. But we found nothing concrete,'' he added. He admitted that some persons under the scanner have changed names and addresses. The judges said the accused have "outsmarted you".
 
 Justice Dharmadhikari said, "People have become smarter than your agency officials. You have to catch up with them.'' Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh, for CBI, said it was a mammoth task to search phone conversations for a clue on the accused.
 
 The advocate representing the families, said "the technology to sift through millions of calls is unfortunately not available with Maharashtra police'' although it is used by Scotland Yard. The judges said that they will ensure funds are provided for it. The court will take an update on March 1.
