AHMEDABAD: As India try to salvage some pride by winning the third and final Test at Johannesburg starting Wednesday, former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin feels Indian batsmen need to apply themselves better and play with a focused mind.

 “We have to somehow redeem our prestige in Johannesburg.   should play the right combination as our batsmen need to counter the threat of the swinging ball with a different technique,’’ Azharuddin said on sidelines of a function here on Tuesday. “I was surprised to see our main pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar dropped from the squad for the second Test,’’ he added. For the record, Kohli has not retained the same playing eleven in any of his 34 Tests as India captain.
 
 “We should definitely play Ajiyanka Rahane in this Test at least. I think Rahane is too good a batsman to be left from the scheme of things and should have been in the playing XI right from the first Test in Cape Town,” he said. Azharuddin also had a word of advise for Kohli. “I'm not happy with his outbursts, especially his off-field aggression. It was not decent on Virat’s part to be so hostile during the Centurion press conference. Aggression on the field is different and should not be continued off it,’’ he opined.
