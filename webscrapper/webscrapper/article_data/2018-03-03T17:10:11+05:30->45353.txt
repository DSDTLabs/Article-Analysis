BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister   on Saturday divested himself of the crucial portfolios of water resources and works departments. Government insiders said the move is to improve political supervision over functioning of these departments by greater decentralization of power.

 Naveen was holding charge of water resources since 2004 and that of works department since 2009. While   got water resources, works went to Prafulla Mallik.
 
 Pujari will continue to remain minister in-charge of housing and urban development. However, industries department, which was also with him, went to high education minister Ananta Das. Mallik will continue to be the steel and mines minister apart from his latest additional responsibilities of works.
 
 Labour minister Susanta Singh got the additional charge of energy, which is being perceived a reward for the Bhatli MLA for his crucial role in Bijepur by-election. Singh was instrumental in bringing Rita Sahu to BJD and make her BJD candidate for Bijepur by-poll which she won hands down. Health and law minister Pratap Jena, considered a performer and suave media-savvy politician, was given the additional charge of information and public relations.
