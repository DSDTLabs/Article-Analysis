ULHASNAGAR: Alert passers-by foiled a   attempt at a shop in   furniture market early Tuesday morning by informing police. As a crowd gathered, the subsequent arrest of the two thieves seemed straight out of an action film.

 The drama started around 6 am when locals noticed the shutter of a furniture shop broken and two persons inside. Following an alert, a cop from   reached the spot. Soon three other cops joined in. The policemen cordoned off the building in which the shop was located and asked the thieves to surrender. However, the duo—later identified as   (21) and   (19)—rushed to the back side of the three-storey building. And on seeing police there also, the two men went upstairs. As police closed in on them, the duo jumped from second floor to escape, and sustained injuries. Police arrested the injured thieves and recovered Rs 9,000 the duo had stolen from the shop.
 
 Vijay Dolas, senior inspector of Central police station, said, “The accused are admitted to Central hospital. After they are discharged, we will probe if they were involved in any other theft.”
