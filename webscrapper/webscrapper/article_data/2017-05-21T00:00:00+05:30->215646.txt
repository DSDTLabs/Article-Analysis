There are some friends who know about your life and then there are   who have been there for every up and down in life. No one knows you better than they do, which makes them the best people to go to for advice.

 
 There is no drama in this relationship. If you have a fight, and she switches off her phone, you just go over to her house and force her to talk to you (and get her mum on your side while you are at it).
 
 
 Because you’ve known each other for so long, it doesn’t really matter if you don’t talk every day. You can be busy and not meet up for weeks, and things will still be the same.
 
 
 They get you like no one else does, probably because they have seen you go from a cranky five-year-old to the amazing person that you are now. Whether something is making you happy, angry or livid, they just know it.
 
 
 You don’t have to worry about trust issues when you are with them. They might know all your secrets, but you have a childhood picture of her in pigtails with ice cream all over her face that you can hold over her for life!
 
 
 Honesty is what drives this friendship. You are practically like sisters anyway, and you know that she is the one person who will never lie to you.
 
 
 You guys never run out of things to talk about. Sharing the same high school means you have the best TBT moments to talk about, especially when you are drunk.
 
 
 When you go back home, you don’t just have your mum spoiling you, but also your friend’s mum who is equally thrilled to see you. Having two families swooning over you is the best weekend stress buster.
 
 
 You’ve been there, done that and cried about it all together. You have no shame around each other and you can hundred per cent be yourself while chilling out with her.
 
 
 You can basically go back to being kids when you are around them because that’s how you met in the first place.
