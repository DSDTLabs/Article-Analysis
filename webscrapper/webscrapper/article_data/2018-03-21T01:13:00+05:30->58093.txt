Jaipur: The Jaipur police (East) busted a gang involved in stealing older models of four-wheelers allegedly involved in selling the spare parts of these   in the grey market and later sell the bodies to scrap dealers. Three vehicle lifters were arrested, while spare parts of five dismantled vehicles were also seized. 

 Jaipur police (East) was getting regular complaints of theft of vehicles of older models especially, Maruti 800 and Alto. A team was constituted by Kunwar Rastradeep, DCP (East). Following the well-coordinated efforts and local intelligence, the team managed to yield results and arrests and recoveries were made. 
 
 “It was found that the gang was targeting older vehicles only because the companies of these vehicles were no longer producing the spare parts of these vehicles. In this scenario, the grey market needs spare parts. Thus the arrested members used to first lift the vehicles and later used to sell its spare parts separately in the market. The body of the vehicle was sold to the scrap dealers,” said Kunwar Rastradeep, DCP(East). 
 
 The arrested accused identified as Aslam(28) was found roaming around at the parking area near WTP. “He was apprehended and interrogated when he confessed that he was involved in theft case in 2015 and was released on bail. He confessed that he had stolen almost 17 older model cards from WTP and nearby areas. Following his arrest another person identified as Akram Miyan (27) was also arrested and a Maruti 800 was seized from him. Thereafter, accused identified as Iliyas Mansoori(23) was also been arrested,” Rastradeep added.
 
 After stealing vehicles they used to first sell its spare parts and later used to sell its body to the scrap dealers which were giving them a good amount of money in return. “It was found that they used to earn almost Rs 30,000 to Rs 40000 per vehicle,” said an officer.
