NAMAKKAL: A 75-year-old farmer died of   after he received a loan notice from the cooperative society bank near Tiruchengode in   late Friday evening. 

 The farmer has been identified as Muthu Gounder, 75, of Thattapanagadu in Mallasamudram in Tiruchengode taluk.
 
 He owned 9.5 acres of farm land where he cultivated sugar cane and maize. "He had borrowed 1lakh from   a few months ago," Mallasamudram police said. However, he struggled to repay the loan amount as his crops had withered due to scanty rain. 
 
 He received a notice on Thursday from the bank to pay 10,241 as interest towards his loan. The bank officials asked the farmer to pay the interest amount on or before January 9. "He was very upset after he received the notice," said K Samiyappan, kin of the deceased. He collapsed and died in his house on Friday evening. 
 
 Tiruchengode taluk revenue department officials are looking into the matter and will submit a report to the district administration.
