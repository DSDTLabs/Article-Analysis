MANGALURU: In just five days,   cracked the case of Rs 7.5 crore cash that went missing last Thursday while being transported to Bengaluru.

 The currency was being ferried from Axis Bank's currency chest in Mangaluru to its Koramangala branch by four employees of a cash logistics company. Police arrested three persons in connection with the incident and recovered Rs 6.3 crore from them.
 
 Police zeroed in on the accused at Kumbaragadige, 20km from   in Kodagu, on Tuesday. The arrested are Karibasappa, 24, a resident of Chitradurga, Poovappa, 38, gunman, and Kariappa, 46, a local who helped the accused hide the cash and made arrangements for their stay at Kumbaragadige.
 
 The incident occurred on May 11 and a complaint was filed the next day, when four persons from cash logistics firm Prosegur-Holdings, which has offices across India, disappeared with the money. M Chandra Sekhar, Mangaluru city po lice commissioner, said police constituted a special team headed by   (South sub-division) Shruti N and spread out to the districts of Chitradurga,   and Kodagu. The cash vehicle was found abandoned near Hunsur in Mysuru district.
 
 Police, who found out that the accused could be staying somewhere in Mysuru or Kodagu, took the help of their counterparts there and traced them to Somwarpet. Chandra Sekhar said that the team located the trio hiding in a remote area close to the reserve forest, and arrested them. “Other accused, including Parashuram who was custodian of the cash, are absconding. Efforts are on to nab them,“ the commissioner said.
 
 The foursome had come in a Bolero at 8.30am on May 11 and taken the cash from the bank's currency chest at Yeyyadi to transfer to its branch in Koramangala, Bengaluru. When the cash failed to reach the Bengaluru branch, manager Ranjith lodged a complaint that evening itself, with the help of company's local contact.
 
 Company in-charge Sachin filed the complaint.
