AHMEDABAD: During a search operation for a suspected Indian made   (IMFL) stash at a rice mill located near Malavada crossroads in Limbasi village, cops found a ‘bottling plant’ for the IMFL and   unit. 

 State Monitoring Cell (SMC) officials lodged a non-cognizable offence with Limbasi police station of Kheda district late on Thursday night as there was no IMFL seized from the spot.
 
 Following a tip-off, the SMC team raided   at Limbasi on Thursday night and found packaging material for an IMFL brand including bottles, boxes, seal, inner packaging and stickers. The team also found distilled water from the spot. In total, the stock worth Rs 65,295 was seized.
 
 “It’s known from the earlier instances that the spurious liquor makers add flavour and alcohol with water to fill the IMFL bottles and sell them at premium prices. As the bottles are sealed and the packaging genuine, it’s difficult to tell the duplicate from the genuine unless it is tested, ” said an SMC official.
 
 During the search at the same premises, the team found an illegal cigarette-making unit with three machines worth Rs 18 lakh and 18 boxes containing 100 packets of cigarettes each. Investigators said that the accused could have sold the cheaper stock to the shops as cigarettes attract 40% taxes and is thus expensive. 
 
 Jyoti Patel, DSP, SMC, said that they have identified Subhash Borkar, a resident of Vadodara, as the owner of the premises. “Manhunt for him has been launched and the further probe will be conducted by the local police station,” she said.
