Baithak lavani exponent,   Waikar, who inspired generations of folk artists in Maharashtra, passed away on Tuesday morning at Wai in Satara district. She was 102. 

 Yamunabai ruled hearts with her unique baithak lavani performances for years and was an institution in herself. Folk art experts said she is the only lavani artiste to be honoured with the Padma Shri in 2012.
 
 Born on 31 December 1915 in Wai, she was taught lavani singing by her mother Gitabai and later trained professionally in the Rangu-Gangu sangeet party. She also received training in Hindustani music from Faqir Mahammad of Bombay and Akhtarbhai of Kolhapur. 
 
 At the age of fifteen, Yamunabai formed her own lavani group with her sisters - the Yamuna- Hira-Tara Waikar Sangeet Party - which achieved wide fame in Maharashtra. Among the outstanding lavani artists of her time, Yamunabai also sung Thumri, Tarana and Ghazal. 
 
 Professor Prakash Khandge of Lok Kala Academy, University of Mumbai said Yamunbai was the only lavani artiste from the later Peshwa period tradition. She inherited the lavani tradition from her family and became a master of baithak lavani, which is performed within the four walls of a room and largely for the elite audience. 
 
 "Yamunabai's expertise lay in classical lavani singing, along with enactment. Lavani is known of using metaphors and she would enact it beautifully to convey the various meaning. She used to sing lavani based on raagdari music," said Khandge. 
 
 Sharing an anecdote, Khandge said that in a rare performance, Yamunabai and kathak maestro Birju Maharaj had performed together in Pune about 30 years back. "She had sung lavani and Kathak exponent Birju Maharaj had performed on them."
