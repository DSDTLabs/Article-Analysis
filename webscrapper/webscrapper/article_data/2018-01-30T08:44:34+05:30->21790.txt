Sharing a dark past, these two young   are now building bond in the greens of  . Eight-month-old Mona, is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that three-year-old Bansi, feels at home at the national park.

 It all started 20 days back when Bansi was rescued from snake smugglers and provided shelter at the zoo. Unable to adapt to the new surrounding, it had stopped taking meal. If the caretakers at the zoo are to be believed, it was on the verge of losing life. But Mona’s entry proved to be a ray of hope for the macaque. Their hearttouching story has now become a tale of the campus.
 
 As per city’s national park vet, Bansi was used to her daily life with humans for three years and within four walls. As such, it was not able to adapt to the open space at the zoo. “If we would have continued to keep her in the enclosure, she would not have survived. Changing her habitat was necessary,” said a vet looking after Bansi.
 
 Since she was bought to Van Vihar, Bansi’s behaviour remained a matter of concern for her vets. She used to live in stress through the day. One day, one of the keepers, Laxman, noticed that Bansi was trying to go near Mona who was bought to Van Vihar 10 months back. “Initially we thought that it could be dangerous for Mona. However, Bansi showed a positive response and felt better after meeting Mona. Even after they were kept together, Bansi started taking care of Mona, and also started taking her meal,” said a vet.
 
 National park director   said, “After the two were moved to one enclosure, things started improving. Bansi’s diet as well her behaviour improved. Bansi has now started adapting the new place. Usually, in such cases, monkeys are unable to survive. But here, the bond that Mona and Bansi share has helped her get a new lease of life.”
 
 Now Mona and Bansi wait for their keeper to come and release them as they rush to the open space in order to sit in the sun.
