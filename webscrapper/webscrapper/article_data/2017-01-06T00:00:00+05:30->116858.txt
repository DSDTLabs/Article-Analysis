City lad  ,   of India in 300 and 200 metre format, is now skating on a different rink. The lad who has recently landed a   assignment, says, “It feels good to be known as a model, but the fact remains that I am a sportsman first and would like to be known as an athlete always.”
Tabhane adds, “These days I’m practising hard for  , which will commence in May. Then in August,   meet is lined up. So there is a lot at stake.”
 The skater says his next big dream is to see skating league start in India and adds, “We need to have a skating league, just like wrestling league, badminton league, football, kabbadi and tennis league. I’m sure   will give a lot of international skaters to India, if such a league starts in our country.”
