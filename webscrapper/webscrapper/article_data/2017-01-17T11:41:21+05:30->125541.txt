Film stars and politicians have always enjoyed humongous fan base in   as laymen connect with them instantly. To say that many do not mind offering their lives for artistes and political leaders isn't an exaggeration as there have been many such instances. There have been only a handful of personalities in Tamil Nadu, who were blessed with a fruitful career in both politics and filmdom. MG Ramachandran, fondly known as  , is the name which stands tallest among them. Considered as the `messiah of the masses', the actor-turned-politician who became the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, was more like a family member for almost every household in the state. The legendary actor was the face of the state at a point of time, though his contemporary in the industry ,  , was the one who refashioned the acting style in cinema. With a knack of picking roles which had ample heroism which the common man could relate to, he eventually went on to become the epitome of stardom and leadership. He was the beloved `Puratchi Thalaivar' for Tamilians across the globe. Like many celebrities, his life, too, had its own share of controversies -be it his relation with Jayalalithaa, actress and the former chief minister of TN, the shooting episode which had another veteran artiste   in trouble, any news which had his involvement was celebrated by people like never-before. Today is the 100th birth anniversary of the cine icon, who continues to inspire millions of people belonging to different walks of life. It's an irony that `Puratchi Thalaivi'   is not with us today for the milestone occasion, which otherwise would have been celebrated with much pomp and gaiety. We speak to a few people who had close association with the actor-politician, who reminisce their memories of him.

 
 
 I have a lot of memories with Puratchi Thalaivar since my childhood. One among them which I cherish is the prize he awarded me when I was in Law College. After knowing that I was MR Radha's son, he asked me to take care of my health. Later, I started acting in films and became busy in filmdom, there came another occasion when he put a ring on my finger. This time, he appreciated my fitness level and said, `You have a good physique, maintain this always.' I have been a Sivaji veriyan, and was the head of Sivaji mandram in Trichy . But, I always liked him as a person and admired him. There was always a fire and valour in the roles he portrayed.

 Since my mother, Soundra Kailasam, was part of the Cen sor Board then, she had a close association with MGR. He was our close family friend. I re member how my mother was instrumental in getting him the best actor award by the Government of India when everyone thought Sivaji Ganesan would win. My mother was a member of the selection committee and she strongly recommended MGR's name for the award. There's another incident that's still etched in my memory . There was an event that was held at Children's Theatre in Government Estate which was attended by the likes of former Prime Min ister Jawaharlal Nehru, former TN chief min ister K Kamaraj, etc. MGR was not expected for the event as he was only an actor then. But then my mother, who was a member of the organ ising committee, told everyone that she was the one who brought him there.

 My brother Sekhar and I have decided to revive MGR's production house from to day , and we have begun working towards it. We are confident that we will make some good films. It's been 60 years since MGR started his production house, and the last film that he made was, Ulagam Suttrum Valiban in 1973. My father Ravindran was (Popularly known as Appu) MGR's adopted son. Though we have been staying in T Nagar for years, we will have our production office in MGR Gardens (Ramapuram).Our portion there was locked for years, and now we are in the process of renovating it, and setting it up as our office. All we want is to produce good films with good script. In fact, we are looking to encourage new filmmakers, instead of opting for established ones. Since, it is MGR productions, we have decided not to produce films which get ` A ' certificate. MGR left us when I was just a nine-year-old, and we are still in awe of the life he lived. He used to visit our home often when he travelled from secretariat to Arcot Road.In fact, it was he who named us. We are looking forward to sign a film in his centenary year.

 MGR was a great politician and he was a very charismatic and good-looking actor as well. I acted with him in Baghdad Thirudan, and had found him to be very courteous and polite. My grandmother used to accompany me for the shoots, and MGR made sure that every scene the film director would first run it by my grandmother and only if she gave her approval, would he go ahead with the shoot. No Tamil hero ever did that.That was him. He had an aura about him, and at public events one had to just go...M... G..., and before you could even utter the third initial, the crowds would go hysterical. That's the kind of sway he held for the masses. Even when I was a politician, and my Congress party had an alliance with his AIADMK party in the state, just the mention of his name would send the crowds into a frenzy. Even today when he's no more, the MGR magic lives on, and will live on forever.

 MGR wasn't too involved in politics back then, but was already a popular figure in films. I am talking about late 1950s and I was hardly around 12 years old then. I used to ac company my father to MGR's shooting locations and served him food there. We opened a small mess in 1954 and served only Chet tinad cuisines. Two of his favourite dishes were pichi potta kozhi (shredded boneless chicken) and mutton kola balls. He would order them at least once a month. He would always order a bit extra and get others at the shooting location to eat with him as well.

 The political situations were not the same then as it is now. He had a way of handling issues in a distinct manner. A dynamic leader, he expected everyone to deliver their best, failing which he would not hesitate to remove that person. When MGR bounced back victoriously in 1980, despite an alliance between the Congress and DMK, I was attending Health Minister's conference in Delhi when MGR phoned me and asked me to meet Indira Gandhi. Moopanar was swift to get me an appointment with her. Upon walking into the room, she was very curious and asked, `I want to know if MGR is my friend or foe', to which I replied, `that is exactly why I'm here to tell you, he's your friend, not just now but in the future also if our interests lie in the welfare of the people'.
