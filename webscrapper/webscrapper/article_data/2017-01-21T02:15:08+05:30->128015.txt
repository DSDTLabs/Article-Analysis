GHAZIABAD: The National Green Tribunal while hearing a contempt plea filed by Kaushambi Apartment Residents Welfare Association (KARWA) on the issue of dumping waste water in storm water drain has ordered municipal commissioner and three others to appear before court on January 31. 

 KARWA in its plea alleged that the GMC had filed a misleading compliance report before   in which it had said that it has constructed 1.2 km sewer line at a cost of Rs 1,17,69000 and has stopped dumping waste water in storm water drain.
 
 Vinay Kumar Mittal, president of KARWA, said, “In an utter violation of the NGT’s July order, in which it ordered GMC to stop work dumping waste water in storm water drain and construct a sewer line, the civic agency continues to do so with impunity. Yet it filed a compliance report in September saying that the court’s order had been complied with. The fact is quite contrary to what GMC claimed in compliance report and so we filed a contempt plea supported by corroborative photographs showing that GMC is continuing with the practice.”
 
 Taking cognizance of the plea the NGT summoned GMC municipal commissioner, general manager and the executive engineer of the water works department on the next date of hearing on January 31.
 
 KARWA in January last year had filed a case in the NGT where it had requested the court to pass an order to GMC to construct the sewer line in the township so that untreated water is not dumped in the stormwater drain as it raises serious health concerns. The GMC had then pleaded before the court that it had no money to construct a sewer line after which the court ordered   to pay GMC a sum of Rs 1,17,69,000 to which the GDA complied. 
 
 GMC then proceeded with construction work and in December filed a compliance report in NGT but it was challenged by KARWA.
