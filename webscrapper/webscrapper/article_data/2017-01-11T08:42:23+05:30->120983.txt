MUMBAI: The BMC and   have joined hands with the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to train doctors on how to issue accurate death certificates.

 With a grant awarded to Tata Memorial Hospital from the American Bloomberg Philantropies foundation, a two-year training programme got underway on Monday.
 
 “We have started training the trainers, that is doctors from the medical colleges in the city,’’ said Dr Rajesh Dikshit, who heads the epidemiology department of Tata Memorial Hospital. These trainers will, later on, train doctors both in the public and private sectors.
 
 A memorandum of understanding will be signed between the CDC and the BMC as well as the CDC and Tata hospital on Thursday. The need for such an extensive public health exercise was felt after a study done by the BMC health department found there was no uniformity in filling the death certificate. “We felt there is a need for training doctors on how to spell out the cause of death. There are codes laid out by the   that need to be followed,’’ said BMC executive health officer Dr  . The world over, coding and classification of causes of death is done in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The ICD lists have various categories based on either external or pathological causes of deaths that have been developed by the WHO and international centers.
 
 A well-documented death registry will help public health specialists to draw up preventive health programmes at the community and national levels. Dr Diskhit said that most doctors who write out death certificates give the mode of death and not the cause. “Most certificates will write respiratory or cardiac arrest as the cause of death, but these are modes of deaths. The real cause could be cancer or tuberculosis,’’ said Dr Dikshit. Death certificates in the city can be issued not only by allopathic doctors but even practitioners of alternative medicines.
