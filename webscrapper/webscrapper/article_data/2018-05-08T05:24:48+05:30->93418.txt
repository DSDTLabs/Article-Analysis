MUMBAI: Siddesh Tamhankar, the prime accused in   executive  , confessed to the crime only after the co-accused, Khushi Sahjwani (42), broke down during questioning by crime branch police after their arrest, sources say. According to an official, Tamhankar, who has shown them the spot where Kirti’s body was dumped, is a hard nut to crack and not revealing much further.

 Police have now sent their mobile phones for forensic analysis to find messages exchanged before and after the crime.
 
 Kirti was allegedly strangled in a moving SUV on March 16 morning, minutes after the duo picked her up from near her house in Grant Road. The body was kept in the boot of Sahjwani’s SUV the whole day. “Sahjwani said after leaving their Andheri office they first drove to a waterfront in Bandra, but the area was crowded. So, they headed for Wadala-Mahul stretch where Tamhankar had lived a few years ago. They drove around for 50 minutes looking for a desolate spot before dumping the body in a drain behind IMAX theatre,” said an official. Police have now sought March 16 footages of all CCTV cameras on the routes the SUV travelled on that day.
 
 An official said Tamhankar was afraid of losing his job after Kirti issued him a memo, asking him to show improvement in work by March 16. “Tamhankar and Sahjwani decided to pick up Kirti on March 16 to discuss the matter. It is too early to say whether it was a sudden rage or a planned murder. However there could be more,” an officer said.
 
 An official said the two were under suspicion since a CCTV footage showed them picking up Kirti but the duo had not come forth to tell the police so. When the police questioned them, they said they feared their relationship would be exposed.
