  Quoting the complainant, police said the duo came in contact during their workout sessions at a posh gym in Patna last year. “We started seeing each other. As the doctor promised marriage, we even lived together for sometime in Patna last year,” the police officer quoted the BSc-pass complainant as having told them. She recently shifted to Bengaluru to pursue further studies.
  
  SP Kushwaha told newsmen the parents of the doctor and the woman were in talks for their marriage. “The doctor sexually exploited her for a year or so, and later allegedly demanded Rs 50 lakh as dowry for tying the knot,” the City SP said, adding the doctor confessed to police to being in sexual relationship with the complainant.
  
  Police have got the complainant’s statement recorded before a magistrate. Her medical test was conducted on Friday. The doctor was forwarded to jail.
