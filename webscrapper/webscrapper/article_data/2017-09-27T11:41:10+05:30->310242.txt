AJMER:   Dam, which overflowed in the last four years during monsoon, has not overflowed this year.

 After the last spell of rains in Rajasthan, the water level in the dam was recorded at 313.90 metres on Tuesday. However, the PHED department claimed that the water is sufficient to supply drinking water to Jaipur and Ajmer for next 19 months.
 
 Moreover, additional water which was released for irrigation in 260 villages of Tonk and  , has not been given this time.
 
 The department said that due to less rain in the Bhilwara and Chittorgarh belt, the dam did not receive a good amount of water. Before monsoon, the water level in the dam was 311.70 metres.
 
 Bisalpur dam is the drinking water lifeline for Jaipur and Ajmer. Looking to the demand, the supply of water to Jaipur has been increased to more than 600 MLD (million litres per day) and 250 MLD goes to Ajmer. Still, the officials are happy that they have sufficient water till next monsoon.
 
 Sources said that because of less rain this time, farmers of Tonk and Sawai Madhopur will face problems in sowing Rabi crop as they depend on the water from Bisalpur dam for irrigation.
 
 Usually, when the water level in the dam cross 312 metres, water for irrigation is released, but looking to scarce showers in the catchment regions, the decision of not releasing the water has been taken.
 
 The main catchment areas of Bisalpur dam are Bhilwara and Chittorgarh. “It doesn’t matter if Ajmer and Jaipur get good rains, if Bhilwara and Chittorgarh don’t get enough rain that means Bisalpur will not get water,” said an official.
 
 He added that even 311.95 metres of water in the dam is enough for a year’s supply.
 
 In 2016, the dam had overflowed and the water level went up to 315.2 metres and in 2015 it crossed 315.4 metre. While in 2014 and 2013, the dam had overflowed in the middle of monsoon season.
