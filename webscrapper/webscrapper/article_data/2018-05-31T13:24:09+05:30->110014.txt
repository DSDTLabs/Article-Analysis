THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government on Wednesday decided to reduce petrol/diesel prices by Re 1/litre from June 1 by slashing its sales tax.

 
 
 Chief minister   told reporters that the cabinet decision should be seen as a token initiative to prompt the Union government to reduce the common man’s burden.
 
 “The decision will cost the state exchequer Rs 509 crore per annum. Any further price hike on petroleum products will also be eligible for this reduction. Our decision to forgo a portion of the tax revenue, even amidst acute financial difficulties, should serve as an eye opener to the Union government,” he said. “It should take appropriate steps to reduce the burden on people.”
 
 The state levies a tax of 32.2% on petrol and 25.58% on diesel. In other words, the state gets Rs 19.50 as tax from a litre of petrol and Rs 15.51 from a litre of diesel.
 
 Opposition leader  , meanwhile, said the government decision was just an eyewash. “The government should have instead forgone the additional revenue from the increased prices. The   government had done it four times in the past,” he said.
 
  minister   said it was the   government's second anniversary gift to the people.
