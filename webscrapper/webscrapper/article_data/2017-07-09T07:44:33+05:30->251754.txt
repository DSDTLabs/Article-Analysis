SURAT: It’s split wide open in the powerloom weaving sector as a section of leaders decided not to shut their units for an indefinite period as announced by Federation of Gujarat Weavers Association (FOGWA). 

 Around half a dozen industrial estates housing the powerloom weaving units have gone against the decision taken by FOGWA to keep the units shut for an indefinite period from Sunday. 
 
 Pandesara Weavers Cooperative Society president   said, “We are not opposing Goods and Services Tax (GST), but we want the government to accept our five-point demands. 
 
 We had a healthy discussion with   minister of state for road transport and highways Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday and are ready to talk to Union finance minister Arun Jaitely. Indefinite strike is not a solution.”
 
 Devesh  , president of Ved-Road Weavers’ Association and secretary of   (SGCCI), was critical of the indefinite strike by textile traders and weavers. 
 
 “The traders have been representing that they do not want GST on fabrics, but at the same time want the government to increase GST on yarn. This means that the weavers have to pay extra GST on yarn. We are demanding that the government provide us refund of accumulated tax credit, which is enough for small weavers to survive,” Patel said. 
 
 Asked about other associations joining the strike, Patel said, “Nobody can force us to shut our units. We can’t render textile workers jobless. Closing the units means, rendering the textile workers jobless.”
