PUNE: Police commissioner Rashmi  , who received requests from school children to initiate a   system for them, has decided to launch a separate scheme called ‘Police Kaka’ (Police Uncle) for school and college students.

 She posted a video on a social networking site and talked about the initiative in details. “The BuddyCop system has received tremendous response from the women and even school children are aware about it,” she said.
 
 Shukla told TOI that recently a group of children had approached her about the BuddyCop system. “We worked out a separate plan for the children and came up with Police Kaka scheme,” she said.
 
 A police head constable will be assigned to three to four schools or colleges. “He or she will visit these educational premises every week and his or her phone number along with the name will be displayed on educational campuses,” she said.
 
 ‘Police Kaka’ will interact with the students who can share their complaints like ragging, bullying, eve-teasing and others, she added.
