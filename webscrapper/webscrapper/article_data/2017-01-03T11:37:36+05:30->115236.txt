MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   on Monday directed the state's health department to provide Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan facility at the oncology department of the   (GRH), Madurai, within one month. 

 The division bench headed by justice A Selvam gave this direction based on a public interest litigation filed by   from Andalpuram in Madurai. 
 
 The petitioner said that GRH is the second biggest hospital in the state. It treats more than fifty thousand cancer patients a year in surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology departments. But, there hospital has no PET-CT scan facility which is essential to diagnose lung, breast, esophagus, head, neck and colo-rectal cancers. 
 
 The petitioner also said that the number of people suffering from cancer has increased over the years in the southern districts. There were 29,033 cancer patients in 2007. But it went to 44,777 in 2015. 
 
 Due to non-availability of PET-CT scan, the poor and middle class patients are forced to get scans at private hospitals, for which they need to spend anywhere between 15,000 and 27,000. The scan facility would help GRH to provide better treatment to cancer patients. Representation was sent to the state's health secretary and other officials including the dean of the GRH on December 17. But, no action was taken on their part.
