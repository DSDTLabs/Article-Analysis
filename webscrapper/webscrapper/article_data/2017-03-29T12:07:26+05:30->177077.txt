After tasting success with Prema Ishq Kadhal and Savithri, Tollywood’s Pavan Sadineni is foraying into the digital platform with PillA.
 
 Starring the vivacious Dhanya Balakrishna and Anirudh Thotapalli, PillA is an urban comedy that deals with the subject of pre-marital pregnancy. Speaking exclusively to us, director Pavan Sadineni reveals, “In order to escape marriage, you can come up with so many excuses. But what happens when one such excuse actually turns true? The plot of PillA is a potent mixture of a whodunnit drama with a generous dose of comedy.”
 
 Meanwhile, director Mallik Ram’s series Pelli Gola follows a couple, played by Abijeet Duddala and Varshini Sounderajan, running away from their own wedding. The plot revolves around these characters, who are forced into an arranged marriage. They try their best to disrupt the wedding, but fall in love in the process. “They say that a marriage is not between two individuals, it’s between two families. When it comes to a Telugu marriage, the role family members play is very important. Pelli Gola captures these moments and presents them in a unique flavour,” says Ram.
 
 Both PillA and Pelli Gola are 10-episode shows which are co-produced by Tamada Media and presented by  , with new episodes released every week. Both shows will see Tollywood actors making guest appearances.
