Indore: After a nationwide protest of the allopathic   against alleged anomalies in the draft of   (NMCB),   doctors have come out in   of the bill since it will allow them to practice modern medicines after clearing a bridge course.

 Over 300 AYUSH doctors gathered at Janjeerwala square and raised slogans as a medium to extend their support for the bill. “Implementation of the proposed bill will help in fulfilling Central government’s dream of ‘Health for All’ by 2019,” Ideal Cure Association Samiti secretary Dr Shailendra Parmar told TOI.
 
 He said that health services in rural areas of the country is very critical as   doctors do not want to render their services there and the present law prohibits them to practice allopathy medicines.
 
 “According to the proposed bill, homeopathy, unani and ayurveda practitioners will be able to practice around a dozen modern medicines after clearing a six-month-long bridge course,” Dr Parmar said.
 
 Owing to the nationwide protest of MBBS doctors under the banner of Indian Medical Association, the bill, which can revive the health services in the country, is pending before the Parliamentary Standing Committee.
 
 “IMA needs to understand that after clearing the bridge course, AYUSH doctors will only be permitted to practice limited allopathic medicines, which will work as first-aid service to provide primary treatment to the needy patient. Not any kind of surgery or major treatment will be allowed to AYUSH doctors and thus MBBS doctors need not to worry of losing their business,” Dr Parmar said.
