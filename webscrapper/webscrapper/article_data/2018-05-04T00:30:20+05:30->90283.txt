Kanyakumari: DMK and Congress MLAs from Kanyakumari district have petitioned the district collector Prashant M Wadnere pressing the government to drop the proposed Rs 19,884 crore international container transhipment terminal (ICTT) near Keelamanakudi and Kovalam coastal villages in the district. In a petition they submitted on Wednesday evening, DMK MLAs N Suresh Rajan (Nagercoil), T Mano Thangaraj (Padmanabhapuram), S Austin (Kanyakumari) and Congress MLAs S Rajesh Kumar (Killiyoor) and J G Prince (Colachel) also demanded the establishment of a commercial port in Colachel which has been a natural port. The MLAs recalled that they opposed the ICTT that was initially proposed at Enayam in the district as it would affect the livelihood of scores of people in the coastal and inland areas. Expressing shock over the change in the location for the ICTT to Kovalam area now, they said that the impact would worsen. They said that an ICTT at Kovalam would directly affect fishermen, farmers and salt pans in addition to casing soil erosion, impact on nearby mangrove forests, marshlands, sand dunes, rich coral reeves, turtle nesting, rare varieties of crab and places of historic significance in and around the places for several km. The MLAs alleged that a few people are instigating a section of the people in support of the ICTT with a promise of providing jobs for lakhs of people and bringing about economic prosperity in the district and region.
