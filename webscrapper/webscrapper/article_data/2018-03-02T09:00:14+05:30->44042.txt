BENGALURU: The BJP on Thursday released a chargesheet against the ruling   in the state and the BBMP, alleging large-scale corruption in development works in Bengaluru.

 While releasing the chargesheet, Union HRD minister   claimed Bengaluru has turned into a crime city with incidents of murder, rape and chain snatching increasing ever since the Congress government came to power in 2013.
 
 In a not-so-subtle reference to Haris the case, he claimed even Congress leaders and their kin are taking law into their hands with impunity. “The arrogance of power is palpable in the behaviour of Congress leaders,”   said. “Once called paradise, the city has turned into a hell under the Congress government with crumbling infrastructure, potholed roads and garbage piles lying everywhere. This has resulted in many companies shifting base to Hyderabad.” 
 
 Javadekar admitted the government had launched several projects in the city, but he claimed none of them are devoid of scams. He said his party is committed to save the lakes of Bengaluru, which were once lifeline of this city. ''The Union environment and forest ministry has sanctioned Rs 800 crore to set up sewage treatment plants to avoid pollution of lakes,” he said.
 
 Senior BJP leader R Ashok alleged that the government is spending Rs 462 crore to build a 12km road near the Bengaluru airport, which is testimony to the loot of public money with this government.
