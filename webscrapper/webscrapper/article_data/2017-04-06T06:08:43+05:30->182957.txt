BENAGLURU: As the truckers' strike could restrict supply of essential public commodities to the city,   has offered to   them. 

 On Wednesday, KSRTC said it has directed all 15 divisional offices to provide buses as and when district authorities ask for them. In Bengaluru, around 20 buses were provided from Whitfield, it added. This was after several customers began travelling to Whitefield to pick up supplies which had stopped there.
 
 Cab drivers' associations in Bengaluru joined truck drivers in their protest. Members of associations announced a protest at Freedom Park on Thursday.
 
 Meanwhile, Bhushan Narang, who represents the Petroleum Dealers' Association, said supply of fuel will not be affected. "We have enough stock and trucks are supplying fuel. There are some inconsistencies in supply which is cause of concern among some dealers."
 
  "Truckers' concerns have been addressed. We held talks last week to resolve the issue of excess fines levied on truckers by the road transport officer in the state. We told them the fines would be revised downwards, although reasonably. The truckers said their fight is now against the Centre," said transport minister Ramalinga Reddy.
