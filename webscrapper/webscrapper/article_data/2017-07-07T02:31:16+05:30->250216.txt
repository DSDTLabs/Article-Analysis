NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s transport department has started a special drive to rein in drivers of public service buses who don’t stop the vehicles at  .

 The department has decided to take action prompted by complaints from commuters. Commuters said that buses of   (DTC) and cluster bus services run by   (DIMTS) don’t halt at the ‘bus box’ marked next to bus stops. Instead, many drivers stop in the middle of the road or much ahead of the stops, compelling commuters to rush, or sometimes negotiate through traffic, to board the bus.
 
 “The transport department has deputed 80 personnel at major bus Q shelters to ensure that buses halt at the designated spot,” said KK Dahiya, special commissioner, transport department. 
 
 Dahiya said that for the first two days, drivers found halting their buses errantly will be guided by the enforcement officials but after that, errant   will be booked and fined. He said that errant drivers will be fined Rs 100 for their first offence but repeat offenders might also get their commercial driving license cancelled.
 
 He said that drivers halting buses haphazardly leads to major traffic chaos on the roads and also make it very difficult for commuters to board or de-board buses. He said that commuters — particularly women, senior citizen and differently able passengers — have to face a lot of difficulty. “The bus Q shelters are designed such that their platforms are aligned with the bus floors, which should make it easy for commuters to board or de-board the vehicles. However, many bus drivers don’t halt near the bus shelters,” he said.
 
 The transport department has also written letters to DTC and DIMTS, asking them inform their depot managers to guide bus drivers to properly halt their buses at designated spots only.
