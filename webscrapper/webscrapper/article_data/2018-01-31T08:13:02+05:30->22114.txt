Growing up in Jaipur, actor   used to ride to Gurgaon to party on the weekends due to lack of options in his hometown. Ashish, who is popular for his role as Ram in ' ' on TV and is presently the lead actor in 'Prithvi Vallabh â€“ Itihaas Bhi, Rahasya Bhi', was born and raised in Jaipur. During his school and college days, he used to ride a bike from Jaipur to Gurgaon on weekends. "It was almost 15 years back and Jaipur hardly had any places for late night partying, so I used to come with my friends just to party in Gurgaon. Delhi, too, had very good party venues, but we'd mostly choose any discotheque in Gurgaon. I remember, there was this one place in Gurgaon which had many discotheques. It used to take us almost five hours to travel from Jaipur to Gurgaon, so we would reach in the evening, party here all night and leave in the morning," says Ashish.

 He feels that in Delhi clubs, the crowd was always better than that in Gurgaon. "I think the mindset of people was better in Delhi and the crowd was more sophisticated, but nothing could beat Gurgaon in NCR when it came to options for partying," adds Ashish, who now mostly comes to Delhi to meet his friends at NSD. "I think my last party here was in Noida in Sector 18. I don't know if that place still exists."
