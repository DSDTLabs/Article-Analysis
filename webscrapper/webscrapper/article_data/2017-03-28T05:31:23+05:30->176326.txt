 The price of pulses was extremely low in the last two months. Retailers say that this is a temporary phenomenon and the prices will come back to normal in a few weeks.
 
 This year, the bumper production of pulses had brought down the prices of pulses. Since the demand is high during this part of the year, pulses will see a hike of around Rs 20 and Rs 25 per kilogram in the retail market. 
 
 Former president of   grain merchant association  , said, “The consumers do majority of their purchase during this time of the year. This is a temporary phenomenon and the prices will come back to normal by the end of May.”
 
 A city based retail shopper  , said, “An average price rise of Rs 20 to Rs 25 have been registered this month. Many festivals fall between February and April and majority of the people buy pulses during this time of the year.”
 
 He added, “There is another phenomenon in the city. Many consumers buy their pulses on a yearly basis. Fresh agriculture produce arrives in market in this period. They buy things to avoid the speculative hike. Therefore, the prices have increased in the last fortnight.
 
 Excessive production of pulses has killed all speculative and artificial chances of price rise this year.
