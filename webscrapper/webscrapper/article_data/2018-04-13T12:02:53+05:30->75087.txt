VADODARA: MS University’s staffers at head office will have tough time beating the heat this summer as all the air-conditioners were shut down until further notice by the construction division of the varsity.

 The action was taken on Thursday, a day after fire was sparked in the old syndicate room on the first floor due to short-circuit in an air-conditioner.
 
 Meanwhile, the university formed a three-member committee to probe the incident and will suggest measures to avoid similar incidents in future. It will submit its report within four days. The committee consists of Dr  , principal of polytechnic college , Dr  , head of electrical engineering department of technology and engineering faculty and  , an external expert .
 
 “Except the air-conditioner in vice-chancellor’s chamber and committee rooms, we had to shut all air-conditioners. Until 15 years back there were only four air-conditioners in the head office, but now that number has increased to over 50. Therefore we cannot take risk,” said N K  , university engineer. 
 
 The four air-conditioners installed then were in the vice-chancellor’s chamber, pro vice-chancellor’s room, registrar’s room and syndicate room.
 
 Ojha added that instead of having so many units of split air-conditioners, it is better that one central air-conditioner is installed. “It will not only be economical, but also save energy and a better option from safety point of view,” he said.
 
 The room where the fire had broken out on Thursday evening was the central assessment room of Faculty of Science, which was made operational in another room on Thursday.
 
 Answerbooks of semester five ATKT exams of BSc and semester three ATKT exams of MSc were saved in the fire, which was the second such incident at the head office within a span of two months. However, a bundle of question papers, ceiling made of plaster of paris and chairs kept in the room were damaged.
