NEW DELHI: Backing Shanavi  , the transgender who was denied a job by national carrier   and who has since petitioned President   for mercy killing, National Federation of Indian   ( ) asked the Centre to amend recruitment policies to make it more inclusive. 

 NFIW secretary Annie   referred to Air India’s denial of job to Ponnuswamy as “denial of her constitutional right”. “It is an irony that on the one hand the BJP-led NDA is claiming to bring a progressive bill for the welfare of transgender community, and on the other hand, the national carrier itself works against the Constitution,” Raja said on Wednesday. 
 
 Air India reportedly denied a job to Ponnuswamy on the ground that the carrier's recruitment policy did not have a category for “trans women”. Demanding that the central government look into the matter and ensure Ponnuswamy got her rights, NFIW also sought a change in recruitment policy to make it more inclusive of transgender persons.
