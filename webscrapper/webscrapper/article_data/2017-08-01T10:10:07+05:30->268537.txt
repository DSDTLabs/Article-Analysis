Actress   has lent her voice to a peppy number in the upcoming film Koothan, which revolves around the lives of dancers. The film has choreographer-actor   in an anti-hero role.
Talking about the song, the film’s composer, Balazg, says, “It’s a dream song that takes place within a dance competition scenario. It’s a fast-paced song on the lines of Appadi Podu. Viveka has penned the lyrics of this song,  , and   has sung the male portions.”
 
 The composer says that it was Remya’s singing of the Tamil version of the song, Baby Doll that made him chose the actress for this number. “There are four songs in the film and we are planning to have different celebs for each song. We had initially recorded this one with a different singer, but   has brought a new colour to it.”
 
 The team recorded the song on Sunday night, and Balazg says that after taking some time to get the pronunciation and slang correct, Remya was on fire and recorded the song in a jiffy. “We have also shot a video of the recording, which we will be releasing shortly,” he adds.
