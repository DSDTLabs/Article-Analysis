MUMBAI: Several Mumbaikars complained of poor air quality on Friday morning following 'Holika dahan' or bonfires lit the previous evening to celebrate the festival. 

 System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 250, which had worsened compared to the previous day's 233. But it was lower than the AQI of 315 the same day last year.
 
 Rohini Kelkar, from Slater Road in  , said there was a thick layer of pollution on Friday. "A lot of smoke came into the house due to the 'holika dahan' on Thursday. When we went to   around 5.30am, there was a thick haze and it was almost impossible to run there." 
 
 Sion resident Vaishali Bhatia said, "We could not see beyond a few buildings in the morning until the sun came up. There was a thick haze." 
 
 The AQI was the highest in over eight days. An AQI of 201-300 is considered poor and could be harmful for the health of sensitive people. 
 
 Among 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, six recorded an AQI of more than 300 (very poor). The worst was Navi Mumbai (364). The cleanest was Worli (130), considered 'moderate'. Researchers at SAFAR said air quality had been 'poor' due to calm winds in the past few days and emissions from fires could have worsened if on Friday. SAFAR has forecast an AQI of 250 on Saturday.
