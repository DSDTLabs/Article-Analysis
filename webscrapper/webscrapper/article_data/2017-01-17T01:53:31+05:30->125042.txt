Gurgaon: Days after a   posted a video on social media alleging poor living conditions in the force, 51 villages in his home state   offered their unconditional support to the “whistle blower” paramilitary trooper. A panchayat of representatives of 51 villages, including Mohlara, Sundrah, Mahasar, Gomla, Mori, Motla khurd, Mohdinpur, Partal, Bohjas, Mandola, Dahina, Kanina, Kakrala, Chelawas, was held in Ratan Kalan —BSF jawan   Yadav’s village in Mahendragarh district — on Monday.

 The panchayat came in support of the jawan after his family alleged that he was forced to surrender his mobile phone to the BSF authorities, which made it tough for his wife and son to contact him. The panchayat, which was held under the banner of Praza Bhalai Sangathan, also demanded an independent inquiry into the allegations raised by Tej Bahadur. The villagers and his family members threatened to block roads and stage protest outside the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), unless the government takes any action within 10 days.
 
 “Tej Bahadur is one among many jawans, who are fighting weather and enemies to ensure we are safe at our homes. If the government keeps them hungry for petty monetary gains , we will fight for their cause. We extend our support to the family and seek justice for the jawan. This is an ultimatum. If the government fails to take any steps, we will take out a march to the PMO,” Subedar (retired) Bharat Singh, the main spokesperson for the panchayat. “I last spoke to my husband on January 12, when he told me he was being asked to give up his phone. We fear for his life,” said Sharmila Yadav, Tej Bahadur’s wife, who was also present at the panchayat with his son Rohit.
