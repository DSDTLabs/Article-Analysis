There has been confusion over new tariff with the government not taking a decision on the matter.The chief minister said discoms have been told to hammer out a solution and not burden consumers. On the issue of financial distress of southern and northern power distribution companies, he also said the government absorbed over `12,000 crore of loans as part of the state joining the centrallysponsored Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme which in turn will save discoms of `890 crore a year in interest burden alone.

 It was senior Congress leader K Jana Reddy's question that prompted the chief minister to explain the steps that have been taken to ensure `power for all'. He said the government had booked a capacity for transmission of 2,000 MW power with Power Grid Corporation of India despite entering into a MoU with Chhattisgarh government for purchase of only 1,000 MW . He said booking of excess capacity was in view of future needs. He also dismissed Jana Reddy's claims that the state was able to raise power generation due to power projects initiated by previous Congress governments. “Singareni thermal power unit was sanctioned by Union coal minister Shibu Soren and Kakatiya Thermal Power Station in Bhoopalapally was sanctioned as a result of struggle by TRS party ,“ he said.
