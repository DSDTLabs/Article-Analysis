 Dr S Thirukumaran, head veterinarian at the camp, says, “All the elephants feel rejuvenated after the camp. Firstly, the change in atmosphere and surroundings gave them a huge relief. Usually, they are inside the temple. When they come for the camp, they are surrounded by greenery, in an open environment that makes them happy. They also got to spend time with their own species, which made them feel much 
 better.”

Apart from this, they were fed nutritious food, which are of two types — green food and concentrated food. Concentrated food were given according to the weight and age of the elephants. The diet included ragi, kambu and thinai mixture. Along with that chavanprash mineral mixture was also given. Green food included their regulars palm shoots, coconut barks and other greens available on the day.”
