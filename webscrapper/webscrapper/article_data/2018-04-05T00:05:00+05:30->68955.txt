April marks two weddings for   actor  . While his latest, 
  is releasing on April 6 — a   in which he has a gay wedding with actor Kuri Prathap — Tanush is tying the knot with his fiancée,  , on April 20.

  So, how is he preparing for both the weddings? “I have been so busy with the film that I have hardly been able to manage time for my actual wedding. I am yet to buy my wedding outfits and invite my friends. And there is barely any time left for my big day. Initially, the film was scheduled to hit theatres in March, which would have allowed me a little more time to get ready for my wedding. But things got delayed and now I am juggling between work and home. My parents are taking care of all the nitty gritties, and Inchara have been really supportive in all of this.”
 
  Is it a love marriage in real life too? “I don’t believe in love. People claim to be in love support each other all their life, and then they lose interest and the relationship falls apart. I met Inchara though my cousin late last year; we liked each other; got engaged in February this year, and now getting married. Initially, her parents were a little reluctant because I work in the entertainment industry, but eventually they agreed,” explains Tanush. Inchara has recently finished her MCom and wants to pursue a career in teaching.
