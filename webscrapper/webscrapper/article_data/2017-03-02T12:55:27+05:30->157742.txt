PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: From a daily wage labourer to a corporator, Raju Bansode has come a long way.

 Bansode, who contested on Nationalist   ticket, emerged as a “giant-killer” defeating four-term corporator   of the   (Athavale group) in the recently-concluded civic polls.
 
 Living at a small hut with his parents in Dapodi, Bansode is youngest among his three brothers and a sister. His father, Vishwanath, is a salesman while his mother a homemaker. Bansode supports his family by selling newspapers in local trains and working as a daily wager.
 
 “I like to do social work so I have a large network of friends in the surrounding areas. The friends motivated me to enter politics. I had contested the 2007 municipal election too but lost by a narrow margin,” he said.
 
 He contested the recent polls from ward 30 (Kasarwadi-Dapodi) and won by a margin of 794 votes, receiving 8,296 votes against 7,502 of Sonkamble. “I have been organizing various events and social programmes through a local mandal in the area. I always help people and have earned a lot of goodwill. This drove people to vote for me in huge numbers in the polls,” Bansode added.
 
 “A large part of my panel ward is the slum area. After getting elected, I want to construct a municipal hospital to provide basic health care at affordable cost to these poor people. A day care centre for senior citizens, a playground and gardens for children. Also, I aim to develop the reserved plots in the development plan to provide civic amenities,” he said.
