JAIPUR:   has disposed of the PIL challenging the appointment of   vice -chancellor   following his resignation from the post on Monday. A PIL was filed by former judge   and others challenging the appointment of Rajasthan UniversityVC JP Singhal over his academic shortcoming.

 Acting on the PIL, the high court on January 2, gave an oral observation that VC is not fit for even the assistant professor post. “He shouldn’t have been there for 24 hours,” observed the court. Court also took the notice of putting Dr before Singhal’s name by the search committee which the counsel had submitted as a typo. The counsel on January 2 sought more time saying that court may not require issuing an order hinting that he (Singhal) will put up his papers. The division bench of K S Jhaveri and VK Mathur disposed-off the case after the counsel for RU submitted that VC had resigned from the post.
