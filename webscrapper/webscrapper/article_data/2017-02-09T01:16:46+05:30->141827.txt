MUMBAI: From this HSC examination, the   will send   to centres during practical and oral exams and external examiners during Information Technology (IT) online test. The decision was made following demands from several groups across Maharashtra.

 According to a   issued by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, divisional boards will appoint external examiners to evaluate students during the IT exam to be held from March 20-22, in addition to the existing internal examiners. 
 
 “The external examiners will have to carry out the necessary work related to the practical examination of the subject. Both, internal and external examiners will be paid in accordance with what is paid to those conducting the science practical exams,” said the circular. 
 
 In a separate circular, the board said that the divisional board will have to arrange for flying squad visits during internal exams to keep a check on malpractices.
 
 In 2013-14, when the new curriculum was adopted, the state board had done away with external examiners for practical exams. However, the decision had not gone down well with many teachers. The board had also found instances when the colleges had not marked students on the basis of merit. 
 
 Last year, the state board reintroduced external examiners for mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology practical exams.
 
 The Maharashtra State Federation of Junior College Teachers Organization, a teachers’ group, that had written to the state government on several occasions demanding that the external examiners be brought back, has welcomed both the decisions. 
 
 “When teachers marked their own students in practical and oral exams, it was found that there was a lot of disparity in the marks given out. Also, flying squads visit during internal exams would mean lower chances of cheating,” said Anil Deshmukh, a junior college teacher at Sathaye College in Vile Parle.
