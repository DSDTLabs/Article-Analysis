LUCKNOW: PM   and BJP chief Amit Shah will spearhead the campaign for the first phase of assembly polls on February 11 in western Uttar Pradesh in an attempt to continue the party's good show in the region where it had a virtual clean sweep in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

 The top guns will hit the campaign trail in the region over the weekend with Modi addressing two rallies on February 4 and 5 and Shah undertaking a 'padyatra' in Meerut on Friday, ahead of next week's polling in 73 constituencies across 15 districts. On Saturday, when PM addresses a rally in Meerut, Shah will spend the day campaigning in the Mathura belt, according to party managers.
 
 Western UP is the best bet for BJP to make its gains in the state since the region is not seen as a stronghold of Samajwadi Party, and BJP hopes to gain from polarisation. The party is keen on keeping its support base intact in the predominantly Jat area and putting its best foot forward in the first phase will generate momentum.
 
 Party MPs Varun Gandhi, Murli Manohar Joshi and Vinay Katiyar, who were out of the first list of BJP's star campaigners, find mention the second list submitted to the Election Commission.
 
 The list of 40 campaigners that starts with Modi and Shah are meant for the third and fourth phases scheduled for February 19 and 23, but could also be continued for the rest of the phases. Union minister  , who figured among campaigners for the first two phases, is not in the new list which includes Rajnath Singh,  , Kalraj Mishra, Smriti Irani and Uma Bharti.
