MANALI: The  , considered to be one of the toughest pilgrimages has been officially closed. The yatra was officially open for 14 days under strict security and amidst possibility of heavy rainfall and even snowfall.

 The four-day-long yatra which includes about 32km one side steep climb is being organized by the government under strict health and security norms for last few years. Many pilgrims have lost their lives during yatra due to altitude sickness, rock falls, falling into gorges and various health concerns. No casualty was reported this season.
 
 A youth from Chandigarh died in first week of July who had gone to   with his friends before the start of the yatra on July 15. Abhishek Kharbanda, 22, resident of Chandigarh, had gone to yatra with his three friends without informing the administration and went missing on July 3. His body was recovered a few days back near  , a few kilometers below Shrikhand and was handed over to his family members for post-mortem.
 
 Neeraja Sharma, tehsildar in Nirmand, who oversees the yatra said last official group of pilgrims had left on July 25 and will come back to the base on Friday. “No pilgrim will be allowed to go for yatra from now. Those who are willing to go will go at their own risk. Medical, rescue and police teams will come back and there will be nobody for any help enroute,” she said.
 
 A little more than 5,000 pilgrims successfully completed this yatra this season. Monsoon rains have already started to wreak havoc in the area. The   administration opens the yatra only for few days every year. Landslides, floods and cloudbursts sometime make administration to suspend the yatra halfway.
