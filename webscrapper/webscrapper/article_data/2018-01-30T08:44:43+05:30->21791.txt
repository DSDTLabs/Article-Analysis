CHENNAI:   was a matchwinner for   for 10 seasons in the Indian Premier League. Now we will represent   - a team that Bhajji himself says was his "most difficult opposition" during his MI stint. There's a lot of expectations around the 37-year-old in Chennai as well, more so because he is being seen as home boy  's replacement.

 During an interaction with 
 , Harbhajan got nostalgic about his MI stint but he was prompt to add that winning the title for   will be his main aim. And if that leads to an India comeback, nothing like it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Obviously I am excited about it. They are one of the strongest teams ever in the   and I am looking forward to be part of the team .
 
 
 
 Well, for 10 years I was part of that team and time simply flew. It doesn't matter if I was surprised or not, every team has its own planning and they went about their job. They clearly told me about what they felt about player retention and I have no hard feelings, I respect their decision. They are looking to build the team for the future and I am thankful to MI for the brilliant 10 years and the five trophies (three IPLs and two Champions League titles) that I won with them. But now it's time to move ahead and you cannot get a better team than CSK.
 
 
 
 Dhoni is calm, composed and he and has a sensible head on his shoulders. I am looking forward to reuniting with him, if not for the blue of India, at least the yellow of CSK. And knowing the Chepauk wicket, it may be a blessing in disguise for me that I am playing for CSK. There will be assistance for the spinners and who knows, if I take a lot of wickets, I may come back into India reckoning after a good season.
 
 
 
 I know Ashwin has his own fanbase and that is perfectly fine. But at the end of the day, many of them are CSK fans and they will support whoever plays in yellow.
