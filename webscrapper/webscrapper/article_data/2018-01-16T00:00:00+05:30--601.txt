 Preet, who is gearing up for the release of her upcoming thriller opposite Sidharth Malhotra, will next be seen romancing   in Luv Ranjan’s contemporary romcom. A quirky take on urban relationships, the film, scheduled to go on floors soon, will have the actress playing a feisty and super-confident urban girl.

 Luv Ranjan, the writer and producer of the movie, says, “Rakul exudes wonderful energy. It didn’t take us long to bring her on board because her natural persona fits the character to the tee.” 
 
 Bhushan Kumar, who is also producing this Akiv Ali-directorial, adds, “Rakul made her debut with our earlier production, Yaariyan. She is a great performer and her strong foothold in the south films made her our perfect choice. We also enjoy a great association with Luv and Ajay, and are delighted to take these relationships forward.” 
 
  and Ajay, who have showcased impressive on-screen chemistry in their previous outings, will be seen together yet again in the romcom, set to release this Dussehra, on October 19.
