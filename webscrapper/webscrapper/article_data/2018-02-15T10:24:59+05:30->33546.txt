NEW DELHI:   leader   on Thursday countered AIMIM president  's defence of the "patriotism" of Indian Muslims by asking him to think hard about the religion of those who oppose the Army by joining terror outfits.

 
 "Owaisi can count Muslims army men killed. But can he also count how many Muslims are in terrorists organisation attacking the army (sic)," the BJP MP said in a tweet.
 
  
  
 
 Swamy's rhetorical poser to Owaisi was the latest in a stream of backlash the AIMIM chief has faced for underscoring the fact that five of the six Armymen who laid down their lives in the   attack were Kashmiri Muslims.
 
 Swamy and Owaisi, both firebrands leaders on opposite ends of the political spectrum, have frequently crossed swords on the issue of patriotism, the   dispute and the Kashmir issue.
 
 Hitting out at the so-called "9 pm" nationalists who appear in prime time tv debates and question the allegiance of Indian Muslims, Owaisi had said: "Those who call Indian Muslims Pakistani should learn something from this. We (Muslims) are sacrificing our lives (for the country)," as quoted by ANI.
 
 
 
 
 The statement earned the reproof of the armed forces, with a top commander saying that the Army does not communalise its soldiers.
 
 "We take on the religion of our troops and we do not communalise any of them. There is 'sarva dharma sthal' in every formation," said Northern Command chief Lt Gen D Anbu.
 
 The General went on to say that the participation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the funeral prayers of the martyred soldiers was a "testimony for all those who wanted to communalise it."
 
 On February 10, a group of heavily armed   (JeM) terrorists entered the camp after hurling grenades and using automatic weapons. 
 
 Ten others, including six women and children, were injured in the attack.
