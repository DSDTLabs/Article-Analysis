Chandigarh: Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala attacked CM Manohar Lal Khattar and the BJP government in Haryana on Sunday, saying that the latest “cash for jobs” scam laid bare the state government’s betrayal with women and youth. Surjewala, who is the media in charge of the Congress and the MLA from Kaithal assembly constituency, said the CM had been caught napping and that he should resign on “moral grounds”. The Congress leader was speaking at a party rally in Panchkula on Sunday. “The Khattar government has openly sold the future of our youth. Its claims of transparency are hollow,” he said. “What is the reason behind chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar being scared of disbanding the Haryana Staff Selection Commission? What is the reason behind the BJP government being busy in ‘operation cover-up’ in the scam?” Surjewala claimed that the state government and police were in know of the scam for the past one year. tnn
