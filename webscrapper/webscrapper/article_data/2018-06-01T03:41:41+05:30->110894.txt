Actor  , who will next be seen in the Hindi remake of the cult classic   film ' ', says one of the reasons why he became a part of the project was having actor   as his co-star.

 
  
 The film is being remade in Hindi by filmmaker  , who also made the original. It will go on the floors on Friday, which is also Sanjay's mother and late actress Nargis' birth anniversary. 
 
 "It's a remake of a cult classic. And Deva helming the film was a great reason to come on board. I met the team once I loved what I heard. As an actor sometimes, you go with your instinct of the film and the part you play," Ali said in a statement.
 
 "To top this, Sanjay Dutt who is an iconic name whom I have grown up watching and been a fan of, was a great reason to be on board without a second thought. And plus it's a father-son duo that actors would love to dive into," he added.
