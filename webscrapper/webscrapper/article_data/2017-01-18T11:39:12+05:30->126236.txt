INDORE: The residents living near   trenching ground have finally heaved a sigh of relief. The civic body has started development works by getting rid of the smoke and foul smell. In the last one month, the trenching ground has undergone a complete makeover. 

 The air quality has improved a lot.
 
 In November last year, TOI had reported that people in the vicinity of trenching ground were leading a miserable life. While the problem might take a lot of time to get fully resolved, the progress has been faster than expected. "Our team is spreading soil, brought from Bilawali lake, on the entire dumping yard," said  , sanitation inspector at trenching ground.
 
 Soil has covered heaps of garbage lying in the area from years. On the fertile soil, they have planted trees and installed water sprinkles. "We have also decomposed a lot of waste using landfill bioremediation methods," said IMC's health officer  .
 
 Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. Two small gardens have also been developed in the area.
 
 "Most importantly, we have been able to control the smell that came out from this place. The smell at this place was unbearable two months ago," Chouhan said standing near the entrance of trenching ground.
 
 Firefighting vans have also been kept there for emergency situations. "In last two months, no fire has been reported in the area, we are keeping a vigil and will ensure that instances of fire are controlled with immediate effects," said  , additional commissioner, IMC. While these measures have solved the problems of smell and smoke, the major problem of disposal of waste still remains intact. The machine installed for conversion of waste into manure was not functioning properly and segregation of waste was not happening adequately. "This will take some time but once the system is in place, residents would not face problems," Uttam Yadav said.
