Noida: The city’s first six-km elevated stretch from Vishwa Bharti School (Sector 28) and linking Shopprix Mall (Sector 61), with an exit at City Centre (Sector 32) will be thrown open to traffic in June, providing relief to commuters who frequent the Master Plan Road-II in  . 

 According to Noida Authority officials, the project is nearly 87% complete. A 2.5-km stretch of the road from Nithari to Vishwa Bharti School was already opened in October last year.
 
 Speaking to TOI, officials said ramps for entry and exit for vehicles near sectors 25 and 31 along the stretch will be completed by March next month. “We are also in the process of placing the segments on the pillars near Sector 30,” said S C Mishra, Noida Authority’s nodal officer in-charge of the project. He added, “For this, we have created a diversion for traffic and closed the T-junction near the district hospital near Sector 30 crossing. Traffic has also been diverted near the NTPC crossing near Sector 24, as construction is being carried out for an underpass at the crossroads. We hope to have the facility in place by June this year,” Mishra said.
 
 Part of UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s project, the foundation for the project was laid in April last year and project was commissioned in October 2014. Once complete, the 16.63-metre-wide (with two 7.5-metre-wide lanes on both sides)   with exits and entry provisions at Nithari, Sector 30, and NTPC will ensure seamless flow of traffic at busy stretches along its route as about seven points on this stretch will become signal-free. About one lakh vehicles pass through Sector 62. Commuters use the stretch to reach Ghaziabad via NH-24 and East Delhi. Several hundred vehicles also drive towards Greater Noida West area from Film City via the City Centre and Uflex route.
