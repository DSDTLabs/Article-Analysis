Having directed movies like Salaam Namaste, Ta Ra Rum, Pum and  , filmmaker   is now trying his hands at judging the dance reality show Dance India Dance Li’l Master. "I am enjoying my stint as a judge on the reality show and since it is a kid’s reality show, I am loving it more as I too am a father. So even though I might know the dance techniques as much, I definitely know how to deal with kids, which is a plus point. I am too good with kids and that is what is helping me on the show," said Siddharth, who was in Lucknow, recently. 
Siddharth has been born and brought up in a filmy atmosphere with his dad,  , being a well-known film producer and his grandfather  , a screenwriter. "Since my father knew the industry quite well and was aware how risky a career in it is, he never wanted me to join Bollywood. He always advised me to pursue studies and wanted me to become a Charted Accountant," shared Siddharth, adding, "I did go to buy the form of CA, but the queue was so long that I came back home without purchasing it. I continued with my studies but somehow convinced my dad to let me pursue my Bollywood dream of becoming a director. I started assisting filmmaker Rahul Rawail for  , but before the movie could release, my dad expired. After my dad’s demise, I left studies completely and joined Bollywood."
