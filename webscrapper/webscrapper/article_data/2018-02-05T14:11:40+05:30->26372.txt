PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has granted conditional bail to   and Rajkumar Jaigadi, who have been accused in the murder of a labourer   at the Campal grounds last year.

 “I am satisfied that a prima facie case is made out against the applicants under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code and in that view of the matter, I am inclined to order the release of each of the applicants on bail upon executing a personal bond in the amount of Rs 50,000 each and furnishing a local surety in the like-amount to the satisfaction of the additional sessions judge, North Goa,” justice   observed.
 
 The court observed that the complainant has not ascribed the role played by any of these applicants in the said crime except to say that they had assaulted the deceased. “A reference has been made to the use of a knife, but apparently the same was used to threaten and intimidate the complainant, but it was not used to inflict any injuries on the person of the deceased,” the court observed.
 
 The autopsy report, in particular, reveals that the deceased had suffered injuries in the nature of bruises all over his body numbering 11, except for two of which were lacerations located over the right mandible of the lower lip. Advocate Arun Bras de Sa appeared for the accused.
