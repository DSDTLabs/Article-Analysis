Konnagar: Taking a short cut across the tracks between platforms 2 and 3 at Konnagar station cost a 19-year-old her life when the train she was trying to board ran over her on Wednesday morning. 

 Engineering student Suchismita Ghosh, daughter of a railway employee, had managed to cross one pair of tracks ahead of a train departing the station. She ran to cross the next pair of tracks hoping to beat the approaching Howrah-bound Tarakeswar local, which she was hoping to board. But before she could make it to the platform, the train crushed her to death. 
 
 The first-year B Tech student of a private engineering college at Panihati, Ghosh would usually take the launch from Konnagar on days she went to college alone. Her mother Sukhla Devi said, “My daughter was going to meet friends at Howrah with whom she would go to college on Wednesday. Once in a while, she commuted to Panihati through Howrah to meet her father who is a staff member in the DRM’s office.” A resident of Konnagar’s Gopal Chandra Lane, Ghosh’s body was recovered by the local GRP. 
 
 “She was our only child. I got a call from her mobile around 10.30am and thought she wanted to tell me she would drop by at the Howrah DRM office to see me — something she did whenever she travelled through Howrah station. But it was our local councilor Sumitra Bogi on the line. She told me of the  ,” said her father Jayanta Ghosh. 
 
 Bogi said, “I rushed to the station on hearing the news. I took out her phone from her bag to call her father.”
