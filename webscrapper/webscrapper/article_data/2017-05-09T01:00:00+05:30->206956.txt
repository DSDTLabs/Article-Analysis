Model-turned-actress,   was impressive as a north Madras girl in her debut film 8 Thottakal. Though it was a small role, it was a noticeable one. About her Tamil debut she says, “I wanted to prove my acting prowess in my first film, that’s why I chose a bold role. As I’m a Tamilian, I was able to deliver my dialogues with ease.” She had also worked on her look for the film. She says, “Cinematographer   tried his best to give me that north Madras girl look. Even if I applied a little makeup or tried to look fresh, he would ask me to wash them off. He ensured that I looked dull to fit into the skin of the character.” 

 She adds, “Having been in the modelling industry for several years, it was little uneasy for me to see myself dirty onscreen, that too, in my debut film. But after I saw myself on the monitor during the shoot, I started liking my look and I made sure that I maintained the same through out the film.”
 
 On her upcoming films, Meera, who is also a bio Technologist, says, “I have been hearing scripts and I will be signing my next   soon. I look forward to take up something in contrast to my debut film character.”
