MUMBAI: The   on Monday cited the “chaos” surrounding exams by   to provide relief to   whose exams are scheduled to begin on Tuesday. A   and Justice Burgess Colabawalla refused to grant a stay on the exam, but directed the   that students who choose not to appear not be considered as failed. These students should be permitted to appear for their first semester with papers for the second. This means that students who do not appear for the first semester will not be tainted with the ‘Allowed To Keep Terms’ (ATKT) tag. When they appear for their first semester in May 2018, it will be treated as their first appearance.

 The court said it had to strike a balance between students who want to appear for the exam and those who cannot. “We find that in the absence of any representation from students who may be willing to offer themselves for the examination, such blanket order [of stay] would not be in the interest of justice. However, equity demands that students who have had a very short period after their admission to LLM also not be prejudiced,” said the judges. Around 660 have been admitted to LLM this year.
 
 Advocate Uday Warunjikar, counsel for students, said the last admission round was over on January 10. “Students are expected to appear for their exam within a fortnight of admission,” said Warunjikar. He said UGC rules mandate a 90-day semester. Advocate Rui Rodrigues, university’s counsel, said extra lectures had been held to complete the syllabus.
