PANAJI: In July 2017, chief minister   withdrew permission granted to   to fill faculty positions, stating that the relaxations granted for the recruitment had been ‘misinterpreted’ by the varsity. This had led to GU scrapping the recruitment process. Goa University, which faces almost 44% faculty shortage, has now received state permission to start the recruitment process anew, and will begin by filling up the backlog against vacancies reserved for ST, SC and   candidates. GU had sought relaxation from the government in 2017 on certain conditions like mandatory knowledge of   for candidates. 

 Sources said that after withdrawal of permission to GU to fill up the faculty positions, the CM held a discussion with varsity vice-chancellor over the recruitment process.Parrikar had also gone on record earlier stating that relaxations in filling the posts will now be given on case-to-case basis. Accordingly, GU started by advertising 24 reserved category posts. The state said that only Goa candidates can be taken against these reserved positions.
 
 The state has granted GU permission to recruit assistant professors against the position of professors, where suitable candidates are not available.
