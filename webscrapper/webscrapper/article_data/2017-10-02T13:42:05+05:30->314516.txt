If there is one issue that has plagued   than anything else, it has to be the issue of 'gender gap'.

  
  
 Every big actor has raised it saying that the gap seems to be increasing lately. But Oscar-winning actor Alicia   feels that she has seen real progress in the 'gender gap' issue in her short time in showbiz.
 
 Vikander shared, "I started making films in English seven years ago and I think even now there are a lot more options out there. People are talking more about it and people are more aware, and I think that is the way towards change."
 
  She added, "I looked back and I did four films in a row, where I was a lead in all of them, but there wasn't a single scene where I was with another woman. Which is nuts, really. So I really want to make sure that I always have that in the back of my mind [when I am producing projects]."
 
  The 'Ex-Machina' star also noted that moving between tentpoles and small European art house films comes naturally to her. "European art house is where I come from, but I can't tell you how many times I saw 'Indiana Jones' and 'The Mummy' growing up. I love to do challenging art, but that doesn't take away from wanting to be part of films that I really enjoy," explained Vikander.
 
  It should be noted that   will be next seen in 'Euphoria' alongside   and Charlotte Ramoling. The flick had its premiere at 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.
