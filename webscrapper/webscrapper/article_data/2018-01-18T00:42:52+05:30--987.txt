Greater Noida: A 52-year-old assistant sub-inspector was killed by a constable in a shooting inside the CRPF camp at Sutyana in Greater Noida on Wednesday morning.

 There was no official word on what led to the firing. Police said an investigation was on. The two personnel, according to sources, got into a heated argument during the morning parade and senior officers had to intervene to calm them down. 
 
 But another quarrel broke out later in the canteen in which the constable Sanjeev Kumar allegedly shot ASI Manoj Kumar.
 
 Sanjeev, who is from Chhapra in Bihar, was arrested and is currently in police custody. 
 
 Manoj, who was posted with CRPF’s 177 battalion, was from Muhammadabad in Ghazipur.
 
 A police officer said, “The argument was resolved, initially. But they again fought with each other in the canteen. The constable lost his cool and fired two shots with his rifle and the ASI fell on the floor. He was fatally wounded and lost a lot of blood. He was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.”
 
 A team from Eco-Tech III police station went to the camp and arrested Sanjeev. “We have registered a case of murder against him,” said K K Rana, SHO of Ecotech III police station.
 
 Police sources said the two personnel appeared to have a running feud and had argued in the past too. 
 
 CRPF officials have refused to comment.
