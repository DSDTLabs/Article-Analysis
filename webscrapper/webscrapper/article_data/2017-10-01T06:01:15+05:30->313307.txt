GURUGRAM: A day after city-based digital wallet firm   lost over Rs 19 crore owing to a   apparently in its own online payment system, the   unit, which is probing the case, has started raiding locations of people who have been deemed as offenders. 

 These are people who carried out multiple transactions, despite being aware of the glitch.
 
  said funds had been transferred to accounts of around 6,000 people, of which 100 were responsible for siphoning off Rs 16-17 crore rupees, taking advantage of the glitch.
 
  The remaining Rs 2-3 crore and the remaining money were transferred to 5,900 accounts. While the transactions of the 5,900 people were paltry figures, and will not be brought under the investigation, police have started tracking down the big fishes who transferred as much as Rs 2 crore. 
 
 The police have identified three people who had transferred around Rs 2 crore rupees. The accounts of two are based in Kolkata and Kurukshetra, while one who transferred Rs 2.5 crores is based out of Mumbai. 
 
 Police have also tracked down the person in Kurukshetra, who transferred Rs 2 crore to his account. He has been identified as Rohit Niglani, a member of the cyber-crime unit said. 
 
 Police also said notices would be served to the banks, and they would be called to join the investigation. According to police, while the money being used by consumers was being deducted from MobiKwik’s corporate account, the concerned banks did not care to apprise the company about the unusual transactions. “Had they had apprised the firm about the unusual transactions, the company would have been saved its funds. We will call the banks and issue them notices to join the investigation soon,” said inspector Anand Yadav, in-charge of cyber crime cell.
 
  A Mobikwik spokesperson told TOI, “We reassure our customers that users’ data and money are safe, and nothing has been compromised.”
