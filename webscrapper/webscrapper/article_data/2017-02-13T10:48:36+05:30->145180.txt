VADODARA/ANAND: Around 1,700   from all walks of life took part in   organized for the seventh consecutive year by   in   on Sunday morning. 

 The Greenathon was led by Kargil war veteran major (retired) D P Singh, who, despite being grievously injured in the 1999 war earned fame as India’s first amputee marathon runner.
 
 Singh, who has lost a leg and part of his intestines in the war, was joined by Anand collector Dhaval Patel and Amul Dairy’s managing director Dr K Rathnam in the greenathon which was held under the theme of ‘Run Charotar for Greener Charotar’.
 
 Being active is the biggest answer to disability, said Singh, who had to initially face challenges due to the non-availability of artificial blades. It was thanks to the Indian Army’s Artificial Limb Centre in Pune that the first pair of blades were imported in India in 2011 – the same year in which Singh had formed a running group — ‘The Challenging Ones’. 
 
 The greenathon that started from BVM engineering college near Shastri maidan, included a 2.5 km walk and 10 km each marathon run and cyclathon. The cyclathon which was held with the theme ‘Burn fat, not oil’, witnessed participation of 800 enthusiasts while the green walk and marathon run witnessed participation of 400 and 500 participants respectively. 
 
 According to organisers, 40 children below the age group of ten participated in both the marathon and cyclathon which were held simultaneously.
