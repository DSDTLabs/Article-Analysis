Tirupur: A woman attempted to commit suicide in Permanallur here after a money lender allegedly threatened to sexually assault her.

 K Sheik Dawood of Nathampalayam had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from Rathinam for constructing a house and pledged the house for the loan. Even as Sheik had paid almost 75% of the amount with interests, Rathinam was trying to transfer the title of the house, said Mumtaj Begum, wife of Sheik. Rathinam allegedly threatened to harass Mumtaj if her family members fail vacate the house, police said. So, Mumtaj has consumed poison on Friday. When Sheik reached the house, he found her unconscious and took her to the Tirupur Government Hospital, where she is stable now.
 
 A senior police officer said, “Sheik and Rathinam had reached a verbal agreement that they would settle the money dispute. While it was set to be solved, some were trying to create issue out of it unnecessarily. So, we did not register FIR.” But the official admitted that Rathinam had threatened Begum. tnn
