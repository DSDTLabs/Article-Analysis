 said his great-grandmother believed he was destined to embrace priesthood but he was elated when she settled that his 'calling' was acting. The 47-year-old actor, who plays a priest who is having a crisis of confidence in his faith after his son dies in military service in his latest movie  , got to live his grandma's wish on screen. 

 "My great grandmother felt certain that when I was born that I would receive the calling and that I would be a priest. I remember being very concerned about, 'What is this thing, the calling?' She was like, 'God will come to you and talk to you.' And I was like, 'OK, I don't want that to happen. When will it happen?' And she was like, 'Well it will be in silence.' So I thought, 'Right, I am avoiding silence at all costs!', I was so happy when she decided that my calling was the arts. But when I put the collar on for this film I did think of her, like, 'Hey grandma'," Hawke said in an interview.
 
 The film has been written and directed by   creator Paul Schrader. The actor said he believes the movie will resonate with the masses due to the current climate in the US. "In the film, there is a young man who is suffering from severe depression over what is happening with the environment and I play this priest who takes his crisis really seriously. It's a brilliant movie and it's written by   who is the guy who wrote 'Taxi Driver' and  . 
 
 "He's a brilliant director and when I read it the script just felt as though it was giving a voice to something that a lot of people are feeling right now, which is a level of anxiety about our leadership and our faith and how those things intersect with love and what we're doing. When I read it for the first time it blew me away," he said. 
 
 Amanda Seyfried, Philip Ettinger and Michael Gaston are also part of the cast.
