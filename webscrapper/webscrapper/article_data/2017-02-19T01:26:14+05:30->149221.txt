GURUGRAM : Two robbers wanted in at least two states were arrested by   after a   on   on Friday night. Police said Aman (19) and Rohit alias Prashant (21), both from Aligarh in UP, had   from at least three liquor shops at late hours in Gurgaon in the past seven days.

 Acting on a tip-off, a team from Sector 10’s crime unit, led by inspector Vikas Kumar, intercepted their bike on Dwarka expressway around 8 pm on Friday. Instead of halting the two-wheeler, they started firing at the police, which retaliated. “The cops had a narrow escape, but the two were soon overpowered and nabbed,” said Rajeev Yadav, ACP (city). The bike has been seized, and two country-made pistols and some cartridges were recovered from their possession.
 
 Police said the two were involved in several cases of snatching, robbery and murder in UP and Haryana. The main accused, Aman, had spent some time in a jail in UP. The gang has two other members, who are absconding, cops said.
 
 During interrogation, police said, the two had confessed to their involvement in a number of robbery cases in Kherki Daula, Manesar and Bilaspur area near NH-8. On February 15 night, the four held two salesmen of a wine shop in Sector 49 at gunpoint and made off with about Rs 2 lakh in cash. 
 
 Similarly, they looted Rs 1.5 lakh from another liquor shop on Khandsa Road on February 14 night after holding the salesmen and the accountant at gunpoint. And, on February 11 night, they robbed a wine shop in Sector 37 of Rs 40,000 in cash.
 
 “The duo are school dropouts. More than 10 cases of robbery, murder, attempt to murder, snatching and under arms act are registered against them in UP. 
 
 Aman was also lodged in a jail in UP for some time in connection with a murder case. They were produced in a court on Saturday and taken on police remand for two days. We are questioning the accused and hope to solve some more cases. We will soon arrest the other two gang members,” said Yadav.
