VADODARA: Facing loss of full-time membership of   (BCCI),   (BCA) has again written to amicus curiae   in connection with Lodha Committee’s recommendations. The BCA has challenged the   recommendations by calling them a violation of their rights under Article 19 1 (C) of the Constitution of India.

 “The Supreme Court had recently sought suggestions of all the state cricket associations while hearing the case. The BCA has already challenged several suggestions of Lodha Committee through an application filed in the SC in 2016. We have again given a reply to the amicus curiae stating our objections to several suggestions given by Lodha Committee,” said Amul Jikar, BCA treasurer.
 
 The BCA’s prime concern was the suggestion of one-state one-vote. The BCA could lose its full membership and also right to vote in every BCCI poll if this suggestion is implemented. “Apart from opposing the one-state one vote suggestion, the BCA has also opposed the age restriction and tenure restriction for office- bearers. We have also said in our reply that we are opposed to cooling off period of three years for office-bearers,” Jikar told TOI.
 
 The BCA has in its reply to the amicus curiae said that government servant in case of railways, services and universities be allowed in cricket associations. “We have also said the number of persons in selection committees and cricket committees be left to the BCCI. Also decisions regarding cricket operations, policy and scheduling too be left to the cricket board,” Jikar said. “Till the time the SC gives a final order, the BCA won’t be able to hold elections,” Jikar added. Two BCA members had last month approached Gujarat high court and sought to appoint a committee of administrators in the BCA as the current management’s term is over.
