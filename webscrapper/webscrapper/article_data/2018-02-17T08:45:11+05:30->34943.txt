VASCO: It’s difficult to catch the young  , particularly towards the closing stages of the match.

 
 After stunning   with two goals in added time, Arrows returned to the scene of their most spectacular triumph to hold Aizawl FC 2-2 in an I-League encounter at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Friday.
 
 Aizawl were cruising along nicely with goals from   (40th minute) and   (54th minute), good enough to give coach Santosh Kashyap a win on debut even though   had done well to keep his side in the game with a goal immediately after resumption in the 48th minute. Aizawl came close to scoring the insurance goal too but had not prepared themselves for another late onslaught from the young Arrows.
 
 Rahul Balan won a penalty for Arrows in the 88th minute and   stepped forward – ahead of Sanjeev Stalin – to level scores with just a minute left on the clock. C Lalrosanga was sent off for that offence, his second booking, and Aizawl were suddenly left to safeguard their citadel like their life depended on it.
 
 Aizawl survived a torrid five minutes and had themselves to blame for not picking up full points. They were the better team in this contest, created openings, and although they scored two, could have easily doubled their tally.
