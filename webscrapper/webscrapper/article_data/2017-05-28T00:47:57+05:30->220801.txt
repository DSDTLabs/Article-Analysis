MUMBAI: Nishit Chhaya, a Class XII   student from DAV Airoli, is not sure what the moderation policy entailed but is hoping the fiasco will not negatively impact his scores that will be released on Sunday. Close to 11 lakh students are anxiously waiting for their board exam results. While question papers in subjects such as physics and accounts were difficult this year, the controversy over scrapping the moderation policy has only added to their anxiety. Though the policy has been restored after a Delhi high court order, apprehensions among students will remain on whether it was actually applied.

 Chhaya, like many others, has been keeping a track of news updates on the matter. “It is not clear on how the moderation policy will be applied to our marks. There has been no communication from the board too. They could have probably kept students informed. There will be fear and apprehensions among students on how it has been applied,” said Chhaya.
 
 Ratheesh M, another student said that they did not even know about the moderation policy till it was made known to them that it has been scrapped. “It is an additional stress for students who are anyway anxious about their results,” he said.
 
 Principal Avnita Bir from RN Podar High School said that there was no need for the board to have made that announcement about scrapping moderation policy in the first place. “No boards make their marking policy public. Also students are anyway under tremendous pressure owing to the board results. This has only added to their anxiety. We are hoping for the best in the results that will be announced tomorrow,” said Bir.
 
 Though there were fears that the results would be delayed, the CBSE is announcing it on time to avoid further confusion. The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination, which was awaiting CBSE’s decision, will also be announcing their results on Monday.
