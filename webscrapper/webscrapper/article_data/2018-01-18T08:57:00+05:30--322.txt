LUCKNOW: A criminal carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head was   in the early hours of Wednesday in   district. Bagga Singh, who had killed a police constable, was evading the special task force for several months.

 A native of Singahi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Singh was wanted in nine criminal cases and had 17 FIRs against him. In September 2013, he was being escorted to   court when he opened fire at the police party to escape custody. Constable Vikram Pratap Singh died in the incident.
 
 STF found that Singh had settled in Nepal and often crossed over to run his gang in Kheri. A tip-off sent a team led by additional SP Vishal Vikram Singh to Nighasan area of Lakhimpur on Tuesday night. Singhâ€™s vehicle was intercepted in the early hours.
