Enough of curling up with your favourite book at home. It’s time now to get out and take a stroll to those iconic bookstores in town that recently had their own new page-turner — Book Shop Crawl II. Buoyed by the success of the first edition, a bunch of booklovers in the city traipsed around bookstores on MG Road and Church Street — covering The Book Room, Goobe’s Book Republic, Blossom Book Store, The Bookworm, Higginbothams, Gangarams Book Bureau and Select Book Shop. 

  “Through this guided walk, we are trying to revive the old-world charm of visiting book shops, browsing through the shelves to find a copy of a novel by our favourite authors and relive the joy of reading with family and friends. While the debate over paper and online format gets more and more exhausting, it’s pertinent that we don’t lose out on the habit of reading. This book shop crawl not only puts the spotlight back on these archetypal stores in the city, but also aims to help the younger generation break free from the grips of technology and acquaint themselves with the real world,” says the curator of the event,  , who is deeply inspired by the works of author  .
 
  Public libraries and other reading spaces in Bengaluru are still not very well-equipped to attract young adults, who are fast slipping into the digital age, according to Vidhi. Reading sessions apart, the six-hour walk was peppered with a variety of other activities such as storytelling, poetry-recitation, musical performances and a lot of conversations. This book shop crawl forms part of the fifteenth edition of Books and Brews.
