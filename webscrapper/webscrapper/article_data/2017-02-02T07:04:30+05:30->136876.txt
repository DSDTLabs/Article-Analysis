CHENNAI:   general secretary   has welcomed the tabling of the budget on Feb 1, the combining of plan and non-plan expenditures, and clubbing railway and general budgets. In a statement, she welcomed initiatives in the agriculture and dairy sector, as well as the increased allocation under MGNREGA. She asked that funds disbursement to the state should be prompt unlike in the past. She demanded that the state's allocation under MGNREGA scheme should be increased considering the drought situation Tamil Nadu is facing. She also rued that no special allocation has been made to the state for drought.

 Noting the increase allocation for various central schemes, she asked for funds for Tamirabarani-Nambiar and Cauvery-Gundar linking from the Nabard long-term irrigation fund. She also hoped the East Coast Road will be upgraded and a new petroleum products industrial complex will be set up in TN. But the AIADMK general secretary expressed disappointment over the lack of initiative in setting up the promised AIIMS in TN. She criticized the fact that no new railway lines have been announced for the state. She asked that anomalies in the   allocation to TN should be addressed while expressing her disappointment over the proposal to set up a centralized agency to conduct medical-engineering entrance exams on an all-India basis.
