JAIPUR: A tea seller is under the income tax department’s scanner for allegedly dishing out Rs 1.51 crore as   for his six daughters at their April 4  .

 In a video that went viral earlier this week, Leela  , who owns a tea stall at Haduata near Kothputli, is seen flaunting the cash and counting the notes in a loud voice as local villagers and community leaders watch. He is then seen handing over the bundles of notes to the families of the grooms.
 
 
 
 
 Gujjar was summoned to the income tax office here on Wednesday to explain the source of his earnings, but failed to show up. The I-T department had served its notice on him on Tuesday.
 
 “We will wait till Thursday. He will be questioned on his income, and it will be checked if he filed his returns or not. If the dowry he paid stemmed from unaccounted for income, a tax deduction process would be initiated. He has also been asked to produce documents pertaining to his income,” a senior I-T officer said.
 
 
 
 
 Gujjar is also under the scanner for allegedly getting four minor daughters married. According to sources, Gujjar had printed wedding cards for just two of his elder daughters, but the four minor girls were also married at the April 4 ceremony.
 
 Police are now on the lookout for Gujjar and his family. “We visited their house but they are missing. Their relatives have been asked to appear at the police station,” said an officer posted at the Kothputli police station.
