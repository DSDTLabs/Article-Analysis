CHANDIGARH: In a letter to the   commissioner, members of the Federations of Sector Welfare Association, Chandigarh ( ), raised the issue of   scarcity. 

 In the letter, they said every year the MC assured them that supply would be improved next year but things don’t change. Foswac general secretary J   said it is a myth that the city consumes three times more drinking water than other cities. But, he said, northern sectors do consume 10 times more water than southern sectors. He attributed this to people in the northern sectors using drinking water to irrigate their lawns as MC officials failed to enforce the use of tertiary water in the big houses. In the southern sectors, he said, people struggle to meet their basic water needs. 
 
 Various residents’ welfare associations, especially those in the southern sectors, are complaining about low water pressure on the first and second floor. Erratic supply and low-pressure has left residents dependent on motors to store water in tanks. 
 
 Foswac members also asked if MC should prioritise the budget for supply of drinking water over projects of beautification of the city in larger public interest. 
 
 Worst affected areas are sectors 15, 18, 47, 48, 50, and 61, where residents are bearing the brunt of low water pressure for more than a week.   said despite the smart city tag, 24X7 water supply remains a remote idea.
