CHANDIGARH: In what could bring shame to chief minister  , a   on Sunday, shaved her head during a protest at Karnal, Khattar’s assembly constituency. Identified as  , she was part of an agitation by temporary teachers demanding regularisation of jobs. Naina, a widow of an armyman who came to the protest site with her eight-year-old son, shaved his head as well. 

 Venting her ire at the state government,   said she had approached the   Governor seeking permission to end her life. “It’s a shame for the state which boasts about the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign. A daughter is forced to shave her head. The government should have thwarted such an attempt,” said  , another guest teacher, a witness to a barber shaving Naina’s head.
 
 She said that the initiative taken by Naina would lead to others following in her footsteps. “Now everyday, one teacher will get his or her   after taking out the protest march to camp office of the Haryana CM,” she added.
