The stage is set for Canadian pop sensation Justin Bieber’s concert in Mumbai today and the entire country seems to be going gaga about it. A slew of Bollywood celebs like Shah Rukh Khan, Varun Dhawan,  ,  ,  , Siddharth Kapoor   are reportedly attending the gig. Joining them will be actor   who’s in Mumbai for a couple of days now. “I have been to many concerts of late, but after ages I’ll be attending a proper ‘hip hop’ artiste’s concert tonight with my friends from Mumbai. I came to Mumbai for work, but I planned this visit in such a way that I get to attend the Bieber concert along with my friends,” says the actor who studied Journalism in Mumbai.
Admittedly, Sirish is a fan of Bieber’s music. “I’m not so much of a rock concert fan, I’m more into RnB and hip hop. I like Bieber’s music. His songs like Sorry and What Do You Mean are my favourites. All I know is I’m going to have fun tonight and experience a legit concert after a long time.”
