JAMMU: In an attempt to end the ongoing protests in parts of Rajouri district, the Jammu and Kashmir government has announced new posts of additional deputy commissioners (ADCs) to work on rotational basis in the strike-hit areas. 

 The formula was rejected outright by the residents of Nowshera, Sunderbani, Kotranka and   who threatened to intensify their 23-day long agitation to press for permanent ADC posts. The government declared that rotational ADCs would be placed for Sunderbani and Nowshera while   would look after the Kalakote on weekly rotational basis. 
 
 Additional secretary, labour and employment department,   was posted as ADC Nowshera-Sunderabani, while ADC Kotranka, Shafiq Ahmad, was given additional charge of ADC Kalakote, an official spokesman said on Saturday.
