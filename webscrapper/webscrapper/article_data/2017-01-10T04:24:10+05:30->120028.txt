CHENNAI: With less than a week to go for the harvest festival, this is the first time the   has so systematically articulated itself in Chennai since the   banned the sport under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in 2014.

 After a protest on Sunday, actor   has now waded in, out of sync with animal rights organisations, on whose arguments chiefly the SC had dismissed a review petition by   against the jallikattu ban in November 2016. Reiterating his support for jallikattu and suggesting that upset animal activists go a step further and ban biryani too, the actor said, “I have played the game. I’m one of the very few actors who can lay claim to actually embracing a bull. I’m a Tamilian and I like the sport.” His advocacy may be significant, as he represents a class that is too far from the ground realities of jalikattu’s pros & cons.
