Panaji: Managing public perception about pollution is a difficult, chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma said.  “The Goa State Pollution Control Board produces statistics. Sometimes the statistics bear out the concerns (of the public) but many times the statistics do not bear out the concerns. But the perception persists in the minds of the public at large that certain kinds of development and certain kinds of industrial or other commercial development have a negative impact on tourist arrivals,” Sharma said on Saturday, while speaking at a workshop titled ‘Air quality management in Goa’, an initiative of the European Union (EU). Goa presents a unique challenge where it has to industrialize and needs to balance the other economically vital sector; tourism. The state sees tourist arrivals that are five times the local population, he said. The reputation of the mining sector has suffered, he pointed out. “We took a hit because we were not able to get the metrics correct. We suffered a situation of almost a ban on extraction. But now we’re getting back there and the Supreme Court has allowed us extraction. We’re looking at an enhancement of extraction limit from 20 million tonnes to may be 30 million tonnes in the coming year,” the chief secretary said. “While coal dust is still a concern in Vasco, the challenges with regard to pollution need to be understood and regulated in industries too,” he added.
