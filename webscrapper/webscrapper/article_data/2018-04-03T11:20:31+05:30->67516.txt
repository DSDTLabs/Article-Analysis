COIMBATORE: A group of right to information act (RTI) activists from   conducted a discussion with   activists in the city on Monday to share knowledge about how to seek information under the Act. The Sri Lankan government had recently passed RTI act in the island nation.

 City-based RTI activist  , who has been filing many application in the local body for information related to encroachments, found the Acts in both the countries similar. “There are just minor changes. Their Act is a little more stringent. But even in India, despite the Act, information on all subjects is not shared. Various checks and measures are used to deny information,” he said.
 
 Since the Act was passed in India in 2005 and activists here have immense experience, the   wanted to interact with them. They shared the challenges they faced and cleared doubts.
 
 The activists from Sri Lanka said that in aspects such as land ownership, they did not know whom to approach. Indian activists helped them with various sections in the Act and also told them how they could collect information on various ownership and land use patterns to bring out the irregularities.
 
 “We shared with them the various scams that were unearthed here using RTI applications and the problems that we had to face,” said a city-based activist.
 
 According to the local activists, it was an impromptu meeting. “It was not a planned discussion. It was just a meeting to share knowledge about the Act. Since many of us have been doing it full-time also in India, it was helpful for them as they could use the various sections in the Act appropriately and not commit mistakes that we committed. They wanted to learn how to get the necessary information fast and easy,” said an activist.
