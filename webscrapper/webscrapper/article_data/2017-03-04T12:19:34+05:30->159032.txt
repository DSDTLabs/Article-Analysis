All Women Bike Rally, a symbol of   and liberation, is now entering its 5th year. Extending the celebration of International  , MT is organizing All Women   across 9 cities in India on 5th March 2017.

 Last year, with 10,000 riders across different cities, All Women Bike Rally entered ‘Limca Book of Records’.
 
 Every year, thousands of women from all walks of life participated in this rally, asserting their independence and   stereotypes. The time has come again for MT to host this year’s All Women Bike Rally and for the city to stand up and cheer for them!
 
 All Women Bike Rally looks forward to the sound of your thunder, coming Sunday at 7:30 am from St. Ursula Girls High School.
