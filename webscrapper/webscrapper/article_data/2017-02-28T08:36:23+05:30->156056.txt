AURANGABAD: The general body on Monday rejected the municipal administration's proposal to hike property tax for the next financial year. 

 After a marathon debate for over five hours during the special general body meeting, mayor   directed the authorities to continue with the existing rates for the 2017-18 fiscal. Besides, Ghadamode also directed the municipal administration to the improve tax recovery in remaining days of the current financial year. 
 
 Ghadamode said the  's inability to pay power charges, delay in releasing salaries of the employees and shortage of funds for various projects showed that the authorities could not implement tax recovery drives in a desired manner. "Many corporators and office-bearers of the civic body have provided crucial data of the tax payers, but it seems that the authorities have not made proper use of it," he said. 
 
 However, he stressed the need for increasing tax collection in the next 30 days. "Resolve disputes with various commercial property owners and recover the tax. Prepare a time-bound programme to deal with all the   with educational institutions and mobile tower operating companies," he said. 
 
 Ghadamode also asked the   to the take all the corporators into confidence while launching aggressive tax recovery drives. 
 
 "Set up tax recovery camps in all the constituencies, deploy enough manpower and set realistic targets to recover as much tax as possible in the current financial year. Similarly, the administration should also give priority to assessment of new properties," he said.
 
 Earlier, the proposal was placed before the standing committee which forward it to the monthly general body. However, instead of taking final call in the meeting, mayor had called a special general body meeting. 
 
 The municipal administration has proposed   across all the categories in the range of 20 to 25% for 2016-17 financial year saying that the tax slabs were not revised since 2012-13.
