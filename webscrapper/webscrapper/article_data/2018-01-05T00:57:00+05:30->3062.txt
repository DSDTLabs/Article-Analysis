Coimbatore: State school education minister K A Sengottayan warned private schools against violating the Right to Education Act and said stern action would be taken against erring institutions.

 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event organized to celebrate two decades of establishment of Dr Mahalingam College of Engineering and Technology (MCET) in Pollachi on Thursday, Sengottayan said that the private schools have to follow the 25% allocation of seats to students under RTE. 
 
 “If schools refuse to admit the children under RTE, strict action would be taken against them,” he said.
 
 He said that the school education department was taking a series of efforts to improve the quality of education in government schools. “New syllabus would be fully introduced equipping the students better within three years,’’ he said.
 
 Earlier, the minister inaugurated the celebrations at MCET. Sengottayan was accompanied by state animal husbandry minister Udumalai Radhakrishnan and deputy speaker of state assembly Pollachi V Jayaraman. 
 
 Addressing the gathering, Sengottayan said that ‘Arutchelvar’ N Mahalingam founded the institutions with a goal of providing quality education with moral values and the government was also striving for the same. 
 
 “The state government and the education department are working hard to modify the existing educational system in order to help all the students of the state to excel in their lives,’’ the minister said.
 
 “In the coming years, the state syllabus will emerge better than the CBSE syllabus,’’ Sengottayan further said.
 
 Listing out the welfare schemes the government had introduced to help rural and Tamil medium students, Sengottayan said the state was investing Rs 100 crore in student exchange programme across 12 countries around the world for 100 students every year.
