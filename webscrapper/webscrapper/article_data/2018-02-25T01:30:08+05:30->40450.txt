GURUGRAM: Residents of sectors 69 and 70 say ride on the main road at   has turned bumpy barely a week after the stretch was rebuilt. This road is situated next to the residential colonies in the area.

 While residents are happy with the reconstruction of the road that was in a shambles for the past three years because of regular movement of heavy vehicles, they say the repair work has not been done properly. 
 
 “One side of the road is higher than the other. So if you have a vehicle coming from one side and you glide towards the left to allow it space, chances are that your car will meet with an accident,” said Jasvinder Singh, a resident.
 
 The residents said the road suffered badly over the past three years because of the movement of heavy vehicles that were supposed to take the Southern Peripheral Road, but took the   instead due to the blockade at Ram Veer ki Dhani, a stretch of land entangled in a legal stand-off.
 
 “After a series of complaints over the past three years, the authorities took up the reconstruction of the Darbaripur road. This time it’s reconstructed with reinforced concrete. But it’s an uneven road now,” said Somika Chandok, a resident of GPL Eden Heights housing society. 
 
 Residents say they want the authorities to fix the problem before any untoward incident happens. “The road also needs proper sprinkling of water daily. We are around 450 families residing in GPL Eden heights alone. We suffer a lot on account of pollution,” Chandok added.
 
 “Due to construction dust, it looks like a war zone,” said Sudanshu Yadav, another resident of Sector 70. “While we are thankful for authorities for having started the work, we just want additional measures to be taken to curb pollution levels,” he said.
 
 “We also need stormwater drainage here,” said another resident. “So far, our appeals have fallen on deaf ears,” he added. Despite repeated attempts, the state public works department officials could not be contacted.
