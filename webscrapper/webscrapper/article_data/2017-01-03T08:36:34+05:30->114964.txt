VISAKHAPATNAM: Civic authorities are yet to address a number of issues at   in   under ward number 4 of   (GVMC) limits.

 The area, which is located close to National Highway-16 and Madhurawada, lacks basic amenities like roads, street lights and drainage canals. It also suffers from lack of proper water supply. This apart, street dogs and pig menace are rampant in the area.
 
 The area houses nearly 400 families of whom most live in apartments. 
 
 “Road connectivity has not improved in the area although we have been sincerely paying taxes to the GVMC. Often, accidents take place because of bumpy roads. I appeal to GVMC commissioner   to visit our area to assess the situation,” A Prabhu Kumar, a business executive and a resident of Srinivasa Nagar, said. 
 
 Another resident P Bhaskar, a bank employee, said the drainage system needs to be checked as many streets don’t have canals. Drainage water coming out from the houses go directly to the roads and the situation worsens in the rainy season,” Bhaskar said.
 
 Another resident   said dogs, pigs and mosquito menace is high in the area due to improper drainage system and sanitation conditions. 
 
 “The area was newly developed. New houses and apartments are coming in the area. But, there is no sincere efforts of the corporation and the local builders to improve the basic civic conditions of the area,” Lakshmi added.
