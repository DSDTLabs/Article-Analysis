 is a struggle, especially if one is trying to make a living out of it â€” that was the premise of the play Natak Accha Hai, Zaroor Dekhna staged by Mumbai-based theatre group on Sunday. The play tells the story of two struggling theatre actors whose co-artistes refuse to work without pay. Left with no choice but to present the play regardless, just to keep the show going, the duo decide to improvise and entertain their audience. Commendable acting by   Azam, Ankit Sharma and   kept the audience glued to their seats throughout the 65-minute play. The performances, costumes, lights and obviously the direction, made the play a perfect weekend treat for the audience.
