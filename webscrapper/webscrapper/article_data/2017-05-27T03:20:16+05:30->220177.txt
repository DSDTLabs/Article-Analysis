GURUGRAM: A resident of Sector 56 lost Rs 50,000 on Thursday, in what police suspects a case of ATM card cloning.

  had made a transaction on the Ola app, and got a message on her phone giving her the account balance, which is when she realised a sum of Rs 50,000 has been debited to her account. When she checked her account statement, she realised that five transactions of 10,000 were made on May 20. 
 
 Bhasin claims not only did she not authorise the transactions. She also didn’t receive any SMS alert or e-mail from the bank about the deductions made. In her complaint, she alleged, “it clearly shows negligence/involvement of the bank”.
 
 When she contacted the bank, she was informed these were ATM transactions, but Bhasin told police she had her ATM card with her.
 
 An FIR was registered under sections 379 (theft), 420 (cheating) and 66 (computer related offences) of the IT act at the Sector 56 police station. Inspector Arvind Kumar said the FIR was registered, and the case was handed over to the Cybercrime unit for further investigation. 
 
 A police officer of the Cyber cell said it appeared to be a case of card cloning. The unit is trying to ascertain the source of the information leaked and the location of the transactions.
