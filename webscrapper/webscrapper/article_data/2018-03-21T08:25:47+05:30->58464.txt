CHENNAI: In his first criticism of the   government, actor-turned-politician   on Tuesday said the Centre was delaying formation of the   (CMB). 

 "The Supreme Court has passed an order on CMB but the Centre is delaying it. The   government must exert pressure on the Centre for its formation as early as possible," Rajinikanth told reporters here.
 
 The actor, who returned from a retreat in the Himalayas, also dismissed claims that the BJP was behind his political entry. "They are saying from the beginning that the BJP is behind me. Only God is behind me ... and people are behind me," Rajinikanth said.
 
 The actor was responding to a question about a 'row' over his meeting with local BJP leaders in Uttarakhand despite maintaining that he was not a full-time politician yet.
 
 On the Ram Rajya Rath Yatra that has entered Tamil Nadu on Tuesday sparking protests in the state assembly and in Tirunelveli, Rajinikanth said the state was secular and the government should provide security to it and prevent a communal flare-up.
 
 Asked about his friend and actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan saying he had not expressed views on key issues like Cauvery, Rajinikanth said, "I have given my view before. I have already said the   Management Board should be set up following the Supreme Court order."
 
 Rajinikanth also hit out at those vandalising Periyar statues. A statue of the reformer was beheaded in Pudukkottai on Tuesday morning and later restored. "It is a barbaric act, I have said this before and I reiterate now. I strongly condemn it," he said.
 
 On his political plans, Rajinikanth said his next course would be taken after appointing district level office bearers for his Makkal Mandram.
