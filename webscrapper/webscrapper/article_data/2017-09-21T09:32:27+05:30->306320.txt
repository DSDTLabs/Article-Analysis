PATIALA: The   and   high court has directed various farmer unions that are proposing to hold a protest here from September 22 to seek prior permission from the deputy commissioner or else their gathering “would not satisfy the test of being legal.” It has also directed the Punjab government to ensure strict enforcement of Section 144 (banning assembly of five or more persons) of the CrPC.

 A division bench of the high court comprising Justices Ajay Kumar Mittal and Amit Rawal on Wednesday also directed Punjab advocate general Atul   to apprise the court on Thursday about the steps being taken by the state government to ensure that there was “no free entry to   city” and on how the same was being regulated. According to a government spokesperson, the court order came on a public interest litigation filed by a Patiala-based lawyer, Mohit Kapoor, who, in his petition, said that the proposed dharna was illegal and would cause immense problems to residents, besides creating a law and order situation.
 
 Various farmer outfits, including the Bharatiya Kisan   (Ekta Ugrahan), BKU (Dakaunda), BKU Krantikari (Phool Group), BKU Krantikari (Shinder Group), Kirti Kisan Union, Kisan Sangharsh Committee (Pannu Group) and Azad Sangharsh Committee, were the respondents to the petition, besides the Punjab and Union governments.
 
 Nanda informed the court that Patiala DC had passed orders for the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC within the city limits. He told the court that the orders had been advertised through public notices in various newspapers, making it mandatory to seek prior approval of the DC for holding any protest. Nanda told the court that no organisation had so far sought permission for holding any protest in Patiala.
