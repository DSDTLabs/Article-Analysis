GURDASPUR: Inmates of   central jail went berserk after the jail authorities began a search operation in the barracks on receiving inputs of possession of mobile phones by some prisoners. Irate inmates gathered on top floor of the barracks, some holding pipes in their hands with faces covered with clothes, and began hooting and raising slogans against the jail administration, following which jail superintendent called for police help. 

 
 Sources said some inmates allegedly threatened to burn the watch tower and jammers installed in the jail, which was prevented by the police. Gurdaspur   H S Bhullar said, "These are nothing but rumours." He said he, along with one DSP, went to the jail to bring the situation under control. Giving details, the SSP said that the jail administration began the search of barracks as usual. When they were searching barrack number eight, a double-storeyed structure, inmates on the upper floor and barrack number four started hooting. They were enraged over routine search of barracks.
 
 He said three mobile phones were seized from the inmates and police would lodge an FIR upon receiving complaint from the jail authorities.
 
 After taking charge as jail minister, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had directed searches in jails to find mobile phones and other objectionable items with the inmates. In the recent past, Randhawa had ordered suspension of Gurdaspur jail superintendent   and deputy superintendent Arvinder Pal   after seizure of nine mobile phones from the jail premises. Gurdaspur jail superintendent   denied reports of inmates setting jammer or a tower on fire or breaking a wall.
