SHIMLA: With Himachal facing huge shortage of government doctors, health minister Vipin   on Tuesday announced in the state assembly to recall doctors serving in other states. Their deputation orders would be cancelled and also those practicing in private clinics would face strict action, he said.

 While replying to a question from   of   Rajinder  , the minister said that 3,282 posts of doctors and paramedical staff were lying vacant in the state. He said that recruitment was a continuous process and efforts were on to fill up the posts.
 
 Parmar said that since coming to power in last two months the BJP government had recruited 262 through walk-in-interview and soon 52 dental doctors would also be appointed. He said that these vacancies did not occur in last three months and for this previous regime was responsible as health institutions were opened or upgraded without any approval from finance department. He said that all such decisions were being examined.
 
 Chief minister   said that health institutions were opened but shortage of doctors and paramedical staff was a matter of concern. He said all needed to cooperate to improve the health facilities. He said that previous regime went for large scale expansion and only created the posts but did not fill them. He said that creating posts was simple but filling them was a tough task.
