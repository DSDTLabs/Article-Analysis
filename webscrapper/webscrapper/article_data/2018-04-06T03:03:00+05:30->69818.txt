Nagpur: The state government now has terminated the services of Ram Kharche, chairman of the State Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board (SASRB), which was part of Pune-based Maharashtra Council for Agriculture and Education Research (MCAER), through a letter dated April 5, 2018.

 He was earlier removed as vice-chairman of MCAER on Wednesday. The government has also told the director general of MCAER to conduct an enquiry into the matter of Kharche appointing himself as chairman of the SASRB in 2016.
 
 The board was formed following complaints of irregularities and manipulations in the appointments of the university cadres. It’s brief was to remove lacunae and bring more transparency in the recruitment process. It was also supposed to stop political and bureaucratic interference in appointment process. Unfortunately, till now there is no separate statute for for it.
 
 The basic purpose of separating the board and the council was completely defeated during Kharche’s tenure. No eligible person was promoted to the board. This led to certain court cases which are yet to be resolved. Some persons are appointed on tenure basis while some are appointed on regular basis.
 
 There is no definite pattern or directives for appointments. Also, there are allegations of discrimination in appointment and promotions. Whether the tenure post can be filled by promotion or nor is not clear. Though the board was formed for appointments of posts of professor rank and above including deans and directors, Kharche had appointed a secretary who was only an associate professor.
