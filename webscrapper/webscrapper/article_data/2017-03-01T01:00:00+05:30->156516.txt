 For an upcoming movie that he is doing with director Tigmanshu Dhulia, Amit had to play a character that ages from 25 to 45 years. And to get it right, he decided to   weight. “Before I started shooting for this film, I had six-pack abs. But in order to portray a middle-aged man, I thought of keeping it as real as I could. So, I decided to put on, because I couldn’t look the same at 25 and 45 years of age in the film.” The actor gained 25 kgs for the role. 
 
 
  
 However, there were naysayers when he started putting on. “Many people told me to let special effects and make-up do the ‘looking old’ job and for a while I thought whether I was doing the right thing or not. But then I spoke to Tigmanshu sir and he appreciated my commitment to the role. That’s when I knew I was on the right track,” says Amit.
