LUCKNOW:   movement in   area and link roads was smoother compared to the first two days of the no-parking drive of the district administration on the busy  , on Thursday. 

 The administration had declared Shahnajaf Road no-parking zone on Tuesday. Vans coming to drop kids at two prominent   on the road were asked to park vehicles at the nearby multi-level crossing between the school opening and closing time. The drive, however, failed on the first two days as administration could not stop shoppers who visit showrooms and market in the area from parking their cars. Also, there was chaos at the time schools got over as drivers coming to pick up kids parked vans in the middle of the road. 
 
 On Thursday, besides implementing strictly   for all kinds of vehicles by deploying more personnel, drivers were asked to park vans at a nearby small alley when they came to pick kids. Similarly, some parents were asked to park vehicles on the roadside near the schools, while those coming after the space was full were made to park vehicles at Sapru Marg. 
 
 Despite all arrangements, however, some commuters and parents faced problems. Anita Porwal, who had come to pick her son, said, “I was allowed to park my vehicle on Sapru Marg trisection, where the rainfall had caused a puddle, in which anybody could have fallen, so police should have thought a better place for alternative arrangement.” 
 
 Many parents were seen stopping their cars in the middle-of-the road to pick up children from school. “ I was coming from Hazratganj and turned towards Shahnajaf Road but saw many cars stopped right in the middle of the road and policemen not doing anything about the jam,” he said.
