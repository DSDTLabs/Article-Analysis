AMRITSAR: Farmers cultivating vegetables in Majha region in the Punjab have asked the government to announce a compensation of Rs 30,000 per acre for the loss of their crops due to the demonetization drive. They also demanded a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 600 per quintal for potato crop.

 Farmers under the banner of the   held a meeting here on Monday before putting their demands before the government. Among others, the meeting was attended by state president of the All India Kisan Sabha   and state president of the Jamhuri Kisan Sabha Satnam Singh Ajnala.
 
 Later talking to TOI, Ajnala said due to demonetization vegetable growers were forced to plough their mature vegetable crop, including cauliflower, cabbage, peas and beans, in the fields. He said now potato crop was meeting the same fate. He further said that they had demanded a minimum compensation of Rs 30,000 per acre for vegetable growers. “The government’s announcement of relief to potato growers seemed like a gimmick as they have not received any money or support so far,” Ajnala alleged. He added that if the government didn’t come to the rescue of the farmers, they would be forced to launch an agitation.
