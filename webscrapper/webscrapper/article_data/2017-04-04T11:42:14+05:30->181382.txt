 Speaking to TOI, a senior KRCL official, preferring anonymity, said that the corporation was faced with several challenges in the last financial year. “There was a huge burden of the implementation of the 7th Pay   to KRCL employees. Also, a large number of special trains were run by KRCL to facilitate the extra rush of passengers on festive occasions, including the Kumbh Mela.
