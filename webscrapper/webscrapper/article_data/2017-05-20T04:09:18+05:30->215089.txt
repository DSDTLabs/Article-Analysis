Titled ‘M S Swaminathan: The Quest for a World without Hunger’, one book details ‘50 years of Green Revolution: An Anthology of Research Papers’ of the legendary scientist.

 Speaking about the “economic imbalance” among various regions of the country, the Prime Minister said this needs to be addressed because “the country cannot run for long with the imbalance”.

 The Prime Minister on the occasion also emphasised the need for moving from the concept of ‘food security’ to ‘nutrition security’, for which he favoured scientific and technological interventions.
