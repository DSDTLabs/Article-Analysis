HYDERABAD: The AP labour department which had earlier given a clean chit to   on Tuesday did a volte face and informed the   that their inspections revealed that the firm owned by the kin of Anantapur TDP MP J C Diwakar Reddy was a violator of norms. 

 Quoting several inspection reports, special chief secretary (Labour)   filed an affidavit before a bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice T Rajani stating that a show cause notice was issued to the firm and a due process of law was initiated. 
 
 The bench was hearing a PIL by advocate K V   of Hyderabad, seeking the intervention of the court to check road accidents caused by private buses and other heavy vehicles. The special CS in his affidavit said Diwakar Travels was not registered with AP under the Motor Transport Workers Act which in itself is a violation of section 3 of the Act. 
 
 The inspections also found several other violations. They pertain to lack of working hour limits, the spread of such working hours in an even manner, weekly rest for drivers and other workers, compensatory day of rest, annual leave with wages, canteen facility, uniforms, medical facilities, leave book, etc.
 
 Neerabh Kumar also informed the bench that their officials found that a Diwakar Travels bus (that plunged into Krishna river in February killing 11 persons) owned by JC Prabhakar Reddy's son Ashwith Reddy and another firm with the same name owned by Prabhakar Reddy's wife Uma Reddy were registered with them on June 26 and 27 of 2017.
 
 The petitioner's counsel told the bench that the officials had given a clean chit to the firm. Once realising that the court was monitoring the case, they now came out with the facts, he said. 
 
  The bench said since the state was now moving forward, it would be better to wait and asked for action taken report.
