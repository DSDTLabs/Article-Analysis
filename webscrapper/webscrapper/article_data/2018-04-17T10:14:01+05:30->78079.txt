PANCHKULA: The broad daylight killing in Barwala was the result of a seven-year gang war between two rival groups.

 Both   Rana, the victim, and  , the accused, have been involved in shootouts since 2011, police said. While Gaurav is a member of Bhupinder Rana gang, Bhupesh was from   gang. Monu has been lodged in Ambala jail, while Bhupinder is at large.
 
 Police said Gaurav was a proclaimed offender (PO) in a murder case. Residents alleged police negligence caused the murder.
 
 Prateek, brother of Bhupesh, said they had received threats from Gaurav four days back. Prateek and his father had informed the police on April 13 and sought police protection. “But the Barwala police post in-charge ASI Ram Mehar did not take our request seriously. He should be suspended for negligence. Gaurav was a PO in a murder case and was living with his family in Barwala, but police never made efforts to arrest him.”
 
 Assistant commissioner of police Adarshdeep Singh said, “The killing is due to old rivalry of two gangs. It was a revenge attack. We reached the spot at 9.50 am and cordoned off the area. Police teams have already been sent in various directions to catch the accused. We are also collecting CCTV camera footage from nearby toll plazas along with mobile tower locations of phones present at the crime spot.”
 
 After pumping in eight bullets into Bhupesh, the assailants shouted that they have avenged the killing of their gang member and would kill others too, said an eyewitness.
