 "A zero FIR has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including abduction for ransom. The case will be transferred to the police station, where the incident took place in Uttar Pradesh," said Dilip Choudhari, Tukoganj police station in-charge while speaking to TOI.
 
 The FIR was registered after the victim Harish Chouhan registered a complaint on the CM helpline number on Thursday.
 
 The 26-year-old was lured into a trap, called to Mathura, Uttar Pradesh and abducted from there. The abductors released Chouhan after receiving ransom through Paytm account. Thereafter, Chouhan reached Indore from Mathura on Thursday.
 
 The incident had taken place on Wednesday when Chouhan, who works as a technician at a digital security system firm in Indore, was sent by his boss Sanjay to Mathura for some work. He had gone to inspect a college site, where they wanted to install CCTVs.
 
 The accused allegedly took around Rs 10,000 from the card that Harish possessed and asked Sanjay to send Rs 30,000 via Paytm. After Sanjay got the call from Mathura, he had approached Tukoganj police in the evening but his complaint was not registered and the cops asked him to contact UP police in the matter.
 
  "They abduct unsuspected businessmen from other states and receive ransom through online platforms. Since victims seldom lodge complaints with UP cops, they run operations despite leaving behind online traces," said Choudhari.
