NOIDA: More than half-a-dozen   of sectors 22, 23, 52, 53, 55 56, 58, 35 etc. held a meeting on Monday at Sector 56 community centre to discuss measures for addressing solid waste management and its disposal in the city.

 
 “Monday’s meet of over half-a-dozen RWAs was a necessary action to figure out ways to handle the situation of garbage disposal in the long run,” said  , RWA, general secretary, Sector 56.
 
 While most of the RWAs demanded shifting of Sector 54 dump site to another area, Sector 56 RWA formed a committee, ‘Kuda Hatao Sangharsh Samiti’ with an aim to generate awareness and raise voice to safeguard homes of   from garbage disposed at their doorstep (at Sector 54 dump site). “We have formed a   and plan to go door-to-door with our campaign to generate awareness on the health hazards of garbage dumped at the doorsteps,” said Sanjay Mavi, RWA, president, Sector 56.
 
 Meanwhile, RWA of Kanchanjunga Apartment in Sector 53 has planned to carry out a candlelight march on Tuesday around 7pm so that they can gather more support for the cause.
 
 While some RWAs have resorted to small compost machines to tend to garbage in their sector or apartments, all others still appear unaware. 
 
 Even as RWA federation lends its support to the residents’ cause, it has been unable to tackle the problem of garbage disposal in the city so far. “Even after around 40 years since the inception of Noida city, disposal and management of municipal waste to a dedicated site has never been planned. As a result, vacant plots, green belts and similar lands are usurped by the   to dump the city’s garbage. As the garbage is being currently dumped in Sector 54 forest area, the residents of nearby areas are suffering the most due to bad smell and unhealthy living conditions,” said N P Singh, president, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare   (FONRWA).
