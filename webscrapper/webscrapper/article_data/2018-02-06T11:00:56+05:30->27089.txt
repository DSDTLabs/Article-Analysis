BENGALURU: The primary and secondary education department has been told to scale up remedial coaching for Classes X and XII (II PU) students to improve enrolment in higher educational institutions (HEIs). A meeting called by  , additional chief secretary, recently discussed the issue of low enrolment over the past seven years.

 Data from   (AISHE) 2016-17 shows Karnataka has recorded a gross enrolment ratio (GER) of 26.5% in the past seven years, the least among south Indian states. Gross enrolment ratio is the number of students enrolled for a particular level of education as a percentage of the population which is eligible for the same.
 
 Karnataka has done better than the   of GER (25%), but its performance is poor when compared to that of its neighbours. Tamil Nadu recorded the   in seven years (47%), followed by Telangana (36%) and   (34%).
 
 Bhaskar said there’s a gap of 40 points between Karnataka’s pass percentage in II PU last year (52%) and that of Tamil Nadu’s (92%). “Better performance in Class XII will definitely lead to better enrolment in higher educational institutions,” he said, adding there’s 20-point difference in the pass percentages of the two states in Class X as well.
 
 During the final exams of Class X and II PU last year, the department had done away with grace marks to understand the level of preparedness among students.
 
 “The pass percentages in Class X and II PU have to improve. We need to probe the nature of evaluation and the setting of papers as well,” he said.
