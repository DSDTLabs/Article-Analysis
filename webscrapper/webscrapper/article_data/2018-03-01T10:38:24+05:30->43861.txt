NEW DELHI: Dairy giant   Fruit & Vegetable is facing a high attrition at the top management level.

 The company, one the country’s leading dairy players with sales of around Rs 8,000 crore, has lost some of its top executives after its former MD & director S Nagarajan abruptly quit in the middle of last year.
 
 Mother Dairy’s head of dairy business Subhashis Basu put in his papers around the same time to join Indore-based Prataap Snacks as chief operating officer (COO).
 
 Subsequently, the company roped in Sanjiv Khanna, who was serving as PepsiCo’s CEO of SBC Beverages Ghana (marketers and manufacturers of PepsiCo products), to replace Nagarajan.
 
 Sources said other senior executives to follow in the footsteps of their colleagues are Meghnad Mitra, who served as group CFO at Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable, Vikas Dogra, the company’s head of sales, and Maheswaran Rajaram, responsible for regional sales. T S R Murali, head of R&D, may also be on his way out, sources said.
 
 When asked about the development, a Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable spokesperson said, “Mother Dairy is a professionally managed company with a leading position in the dairy sector. While we do not wish to comment on specific changes, it will be sufficient to say that movement of professionals is an industry wide phenomena. Strong HR practices and the brand name of Mother Dairy is enabling us to get the right mix of talent for accelerated growth in alignment with the organisational strategy.”
 
 Most of the senior executives, who have quit Mother Dairy, are ex-PepsiCo employees.
