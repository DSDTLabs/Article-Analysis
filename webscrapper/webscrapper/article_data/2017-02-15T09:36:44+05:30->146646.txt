RANCHI: Subject combination as a requisite for the application of high school teachers' recruitment examination seems to be a barrier for many candidates. 

 The department demands a   which includes mathematics-physics, chemistry-biology and history-political science for the recruitment of  , chemistry and history teachers in government high schools. 
 
 Ankita Kumari, an aspirant, said, "I had mathematics as my main subject but my subsidiary subject was geology. I want to apply for the post of a mathematics teacher but the rules demand   as a compulsory subject along with maths. Now, I won't be able to appear for the exam."
 
 Similarly, several other candidates also complained that despite securing good marks in the main subject including mathematics, chemistry or history, they are not able to sit for the recruitment examination because they do not have the subsidiary subject demanded by the department. 
 
 Pramod Kumar, who has applied for the post of history teacher, said, "I will have to work extra than the candidates appearing for other subjects because along with history, I will also have to prepare for political science. This is really unfair."
 
 However, school   secretary   said the subject combination for recruitment for a few subjects was necessary.
 
 "The subject combination has been made according to the basic physics-chemistry-mathematics and physics-chemistry-biology combination. History teachers will have to be familiar with political science," Patnaik said.
