In 1994, following the release of his film  , Kamal Haasan was referred to by his fans as ‘Nammavar’. However, once he was given the title of  , fans began to use that one to refer to their idol. But now, following his political plunge, which happened officially on Wednesday, the actor has gone back to taking the older moniker.

 ‘Ulaganayagan’, which is roughly translated to ‘Universal Hero’, is a term that was coined to indicate that the actor belonged to the league of global acting talent and came into existence during a time when fans believed that he would win an Oscar for his acting prowess. The fact that Kamal’s Nayakan came to be acknowledged as a masterpiece also played a part.
 
 When he was asked about this, Kamal Haasan explained that he was not becoming ‘Nammavar’ from ‘Ulaganayagan’ as his fans were calling him by that moniker even before they called him ‘Ulaganayagan’. “I’m back to Nammavar again,” he remarked and added that people calling him ‘Nammavar’ amounts to them “owning me up as their man.”
 
 Monikers have played an important part in Dravidian politics and have been used by leaders to endear themselves to people. While   was called ‘Anna’ (Brother), M   was referred to as ‘Kalaignar’. MG  , who was called ‘Makkal Thilagam’ while he was acting in films, became ‘Puratchi Thalaivar ’ after his political entry, while J Jayalalithaa, who was referred to as ‘Puratchi Thalaivi’, came to be called as ‘Amma’ once she became the chief minister.
