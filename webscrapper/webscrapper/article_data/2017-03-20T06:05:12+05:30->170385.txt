 By the time the loan was extended, Sridhar had retired from service. After investigation, CBI filed a chargesheet against all six persons. It said Sridhar stood accused of omission by entering a criminal conspiracy with other accused and had cheated the bank to the tune of Rs 436.76 crore.
 
 Sridhar last year unsuccessfully sought a discharge from the case before a special CBI court.
 
 In granting the discharge, Justice Z K Saiyed of the high court observed, “Even from the statements (of witnesses), the prosecution could not establish prima facie the ingredients of conspiracy against the present applicant (Sridhar). No doubt, the statements may create some suspicion against him. But suspicion is not sufficient to hold that there is a reasonable prospect of convicting the applicant of the offence of criminal conspiracy”
