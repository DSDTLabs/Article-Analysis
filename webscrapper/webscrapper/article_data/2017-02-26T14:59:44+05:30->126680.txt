 has been roped in for a 'special song' in the upcoming Raj Tarun-starrer,  . 'It's a solo special song which is picturised only on me, you won't see   or anybody else in the song dancing with me. It's not a item song, but a situational number connected to the story of the film,' reveals an excited Hamsa adding, 'I have already shot for two days in Hyderabad for the song. It's a full on dance number with crazy dance moves that is set in a roadside dhaba.'
The actress is quite chuffed about the number and says she will be looking her 'hottest'. 
 'Trust me, I haven't looked as hot as this ever, so the audience will for sure see me in a hitherto unseen sensuous avatar. I'm very kicked about it,' she says as she signs off.
