THRISSUR: The state school arts festival’s drama competition – which began at the regional theatre on Sunday – evoked a wide response from the audience, but the lack of space inside the auditorium frustrated them.

 The recently  , owned by  , is a good auditorium with high level of technical facilities if the performance is meant for a select audience. But, organizers were caught unawares by the huge audience turnout.
 
 While the auditorium could accommodate 600, hundreds were waiting outside. “They should have anticipated that Thrissur natives just love drama. An open air theatre would have accommodated more people and actors would have gotten an opportunity to express their skills more freely,” said theatre activist  .
 
 “We did try to warn the authorities earlier about this possibility at drama competition. But, they chose to hold the competition at regional theatre itself,” said children’s theatre expert  .
 
 Following protests from the audience, agriculture minister  , who is also the chairman of the reception committee, intervened and arranged a large screen so that the drama was seen by those standing outside.
 
 Theatre activists generally lauded the performance of contestants and said many of them dwelt on issues like communal divide and environmental degradation. Plays like ‘Elipetty’ – presented by the high school students of Thiruvangoor Higher Secondary School, Kozhikode and ‘Annaperuma’ presented by students of Memunda Higher secondary school, Kozhikode drew special appreciation.
