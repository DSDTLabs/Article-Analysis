SALEM: Chief minister   launched a strident attack on his predecessor   and the latter's   calling them traitors. 

 Defending charges that he was running a benami government, Palaniswami, told a gathering at a public meeting in Salem on Tuesday that his government follows the tenets laid down by AIADMK founder   and Jayalalithaa. "What needs to be counted is the efficiency of the government. The   has completed several projects and has sanctioned several more welfare projects. But what did O Panneerselvam do during his tenure?'' he asked. Stating that Semmalai and OPS were part of the Janaki faction when AIADMk split after MGR's demise, he accused both of burning portraits of Jayalalithaa during the protests then. "Now they claim to be loyalists of Amma. They are traitors and we are true loyalists of Amma,'' he said.
 
 Palaniswami also hit out at   for stating that he looks forward to a general election in Tamil Nadu. "Has he ever visited a village and met the public? What fault did he find in the present governance? He should not forget the help he received for the release of his film Viswaroopam,'' Palaniswami said.
 
 Giving away welfare assistance to public during the meeting organized at Bose grounds to celebrate late chief minister J Jayalalithaa's birth anniversary, Palaniswami listed out the projects implemented during Jayalalithaa's rule and those in the pipeline. 
 
 "After I became a minister in Amma's cabinet, I appealed to her for a health care facility and she immediately sanctioned a hospital at Rs 50 crore. She approved a two tier bridge at Rs 320crore, another one at Rs 110 crore and one more costing Rs 26 crore,'' he said. Jayalalithaa also brought several more bridges, drinking water projects, roads and under ground drainage facilities to Salem.
