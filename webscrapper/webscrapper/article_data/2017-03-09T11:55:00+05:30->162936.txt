HYDERABAD: Nearly 50% of   in the city and state do not have basic facilities and openly flout norms, according to the   (AICTE), which controls all   across the country .

 AICTE sources said that they have begun surprise raids across the state and the future of nearly these 50% engineering, pharmacy and MBA colleges in Telangana now hangs in the balance as they may lose affiliation if inspections reveal that rules have been flouted.
 
 “The AICTE had made a list of colleges with   and AP and decided to pay a surprise visit to see whether they are flouting any norms,“ said a source close to AICTE on condition of anonymity . According to sources, AICTE is targeting colleges which were inspected only once till date and given a chance to appeal before the council in New Delhi.“As the AICTE does not have resources to cover all colleges, they have picked a few in both the   and paying surprise visits,“ the source said.
 
 KRamadas, president of Telangana State Pharmacy Colleges, said that colleges being visited by AICTE were established in 2007 or later and were inspected once when they were established.
 
 Apart from inspecting colleges, the AICTE has also specified that from the next academic year if an institute has 30 or less percentage of seats filled in three consecutive years then they would have to shut the course for good.
 
 Welcoming this move, N Yadaiah, registrar of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad (JNTU-H), said that this would help universities to maintain standards. “This will make our job easier as we need not ask colleges to close a course. Anyway , as per JNTU rule, if they have less than 25% admissions in consecutive three years, colleges have to close that course,“ said Yadaiah. Talking about surprise raids, he said, “It's true that AICTE has conducted surprise raids, but we don't have much information on that. They are supposed to send us a copy of the report.Once we receive it, we will have more information.“
