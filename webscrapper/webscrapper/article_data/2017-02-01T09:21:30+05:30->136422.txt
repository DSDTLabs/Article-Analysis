LUCKNOW: City-based transgender activist  , who rose to fame after contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Lucknow, filed her   from Malihabad constituency on Tuesday.

 While she contested as an Independent candidate in 2014, she is contesting on a Lok Dal ticket in the upcoming assembly elections. Lok Dal was structured by former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh in 1980.
 
 The 37-year-old transgender activist said she chose Malihabad as a constituency as she was “fed up” of politicians serving the interests of the rich, while ignoring the poor. “There is nobody to hear the poor. Politicians forget that the poor form the majority of voters. I want to work for those who don’t have a voice,” she said.
 
 Talking about the way most transgenders are marginalised by the society and government, Singh said, “If the government expects the third gender to file taxes and pay bills like normal citizens, then they should also ensure that we can get identity documents like PAN cards and Aadhaar cards easily. We often have to face corruption in these processes.
 
 The election results, Singh says, will not mar her plans for future. 
 
 “If I don’t win this time, I will contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. I will keep contesting elections till my voice is heard,” said the transgender activist, who has also acted in a host of television programmes.
 
 Malihabad, famous for its mango orchards, is a rural constituency and has over 3.5 lakh registered voters. While   is fielding Satya Kumar Gautam, Jaya Devi will contest on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket while Samajwadi Party will field the sitting MLA Indal Rawat.
