NAVI MUMBAI: The   (NMMC) has towed 188   in the past one week after it kicked off a drive against them in a run up to the  , which requires the city to be cleared of  . The vehicles have been parked at two designated spots— sector 6 ground allotted for a bus depot in Rabale and another one near the open plot at the erstwhile Koparkhairane dumping yard. 

 The NMMC will initiate an auction if owners of these vehicles fail to claim them after paying the imposed penalty. “After due procedure of the law, notices have been pasted on these discarded vehicles that are occupying roads, footpaths, pavements and public places obstructing the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. The vehicles were seized after the completion of three-day notice period with the deployment of towing vans and additional manpower,” said NMMC additional commissioner Ankush Chavan. 
 
 The Turbhe node topped the list with 59 seized abandoned vehicles while Koparkhairane recorded 29 vehicles as of Monday. The least number of vehicles were lifted from Digha ward with just four. Four-wheelers formed a major chunk of vehicles with 114 whereas 51 two-wheelers and 21 three-wheelers were towed away to dumping sites. Two six-wheelers also featured in the list of 188 abandoned vehicles.
 
 “We have fixed a penalty of Rs 6,100 for each vehicle when the claimants approach us to reclaim their property. Besides, towing charges will also be paid by the owner of the vehicles. We will continue to crack the whip on such vehicles that come as a major hurdle in terms of cleanliness and traffic congestion,” said Chavan. 
 
 All ward officers have been told to stick notices on these vehicles, citing three days’ timeline to shift the vehicles to designated dumping yards failing which they will be towed for further auctioning. This is also part of civic body’s initiative on regularising haphazard parking.
