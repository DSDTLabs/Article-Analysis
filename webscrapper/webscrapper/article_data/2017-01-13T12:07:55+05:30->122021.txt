BHOPAL: In what comes as a respite for schools students in  , the education department will now transfer   to around 82 lakh students to their respective accounts in just one click.

 The state government disburses 30 different scholarships worth around Rs 500 crore. The school education department has embarked on ‘Mission One Click’ (e-scholarships), which will be inaugurated on Thursday by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. MP will be the first state to start   to around 80 lakh students from class 1 to 12 across the state. A bill in this regard was passed during the recent winter session of the assembly after issues of malpractices and corruption were raised by the MLAs. It was unanimously decided that scholarship should be transferred directly into student’s bank accounts. “A data bank of over 82 lakh students has been made available on an online portal of education department. The mission one click aims to bring transparency in the system,” reads an official statement issued by Directorate of Public Instructions (DPI) Bhopal. It further stated that Madhya Pradesh is the first state to take such an initiative in the country. “It is a major step towards Digital India,” it said.
