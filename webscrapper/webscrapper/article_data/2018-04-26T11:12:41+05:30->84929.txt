BENGALURU: The ongoing trial in the   murder case is likely to be completed by the end of October with the Supreme Court directing the   magistrate court to complete recording the statements of witnesses in six months. 

  The   gave the directions on Monday while hearing the bail plea of Rajeshwari Shetty, Bhaskar's wife who is the prime accused in the case, along with four others, including her son Navaneet Shetty. 
 
  The other accused are family astrologer Niranjan Bhat, 26, Bhat's father Srinivas Bhat, 56, and Rajeshwari's driver Raghavendra Parameshwara, 26. 
 
  "We direct that the petitioner be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial court after the last 36 witnesses are examined. The trial court will examine the witnesses within six months," the SC said. 
 
 Bhaskar, an   industrialist, was allegedly murdered on July 28, 2016 at his Udupi residence and his body was burnt in a homa kunda in an alleged attempt to destroy evidence. The accused had dumped the remains that included ashes and bones in three rivulets.
 
 Eventually, his burnt bones led the cops to the accused. The DNA samples of the bones had matched with the blood samples of  , mother of Bhaskar Shetty, establishing evidence that it was the latter's body. 
 
 Rajeshwari had moved the Supreme Court as the Karnataka high court had rejected her bail petition.
