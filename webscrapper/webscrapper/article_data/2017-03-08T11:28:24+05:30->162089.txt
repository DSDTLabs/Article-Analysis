 The two have known each other for 14 years and with the upcoming film  , a historical biopic, the duo reunites as writer and director. 'Hirkani' is a film about motherhood and will go on floors soon. Ask Prasad about choosing Chinmay as the writer of this film and he says, “We had a few names in mind but I thought Chinmay could do justice to the story. Plus, he hasn’t written anything historical so this was a chance for him to explore as well.” 
 
 He adds, “There are few people whose writings stay with you forever and Chinmay is one such.” Chinmay’s first writing project in theatre, ' ', had Prasad acting. This continued with the former’s first television and film project as well. So when Prasad was debuting as a director, the obvious choice was Chinmay as the writer. “My debut film, 
 ' ', has a very different story and I couldn’t think of anyone but Chinmay for it. With Hirkani, we’ve taken the association further and hope to continue the same,” says Prasad.
