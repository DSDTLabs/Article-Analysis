THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   is all set to give Sophocles’s Greek classic play ‘Oedipus Rex’ a Malayalam retelling. 

 While a young   in Greek mythology blinded himself as a punishment for unknowingly marrying his mother, the play by KPAC drama company ‘Oedipus’ directed by   aims to clear the story of all superstitions and prophesies and present a rational and realistic version.
 
 Narayan attempts to retell the story of Oedipus as he blends it with the elements of democracy and present-day politics to cater to the contemporary audience. “While the Greek myth still continues to showcase a concept that a prophesy or superstition had led to Oedipus’s ill fate, we are trying to present the events as a coincidence which is very natural and could have happened to anyone,” said Narayan.
 
 ‘Oedipus’ will be staged for the first time at the Karthika Thirunal Auditorium at East Fort on Tuesday. Chief minister   will inaugurate the   at 5.30pm and the play will begin at 7pm. 
 
 The 2-hour-10-minute play enacted by a crew of 20 artists is KPAC’s 63rd play. The company is staging a fresh play after a gap of one year. The last play by KPAC was ‘Seethayanam’.
