PANAJI: The directorate of agriculture is putting together a plan of action for improved   and sugarcane in the state. 

 Currently   in Goa is scattered, and in order to develop a commercial potential, the department will have to look at   in a concentrated area according to officials.
 
 “ Our taluka-level,   have been asked to identify potential farmers who can take up  . These farmers will be provided with mango grafts and the crops’ growth will be monitored by our technical officers,” said agriculture director, Ulhas Pai Kakode.
 
 “We will also prepare fields by digging pits. Wherever possible, drip-irrigation or pot-irrigation system will be applied depending on the crop’s requirements,” he added.
 
 He said that not many farmers are aware that mangoes can be planted on rocky land, in areas like Canacona, Pernem, Bicholim, etc and that measures will be adopted to initiate mango farming on such terrain as well.
 
 Innovations in the sugarcane industry, too, are also being looked at by way of modified sustainable sugarcane initiatives. As part of this venture, farmers are being advised to grow the crop with single sugarcane seedlings, raised in pro-trees. “We have already identified farmers for this initiative. Dharbandora-based, Sanjeevani sugarcane factory will provide the seedlings which will be planted in December this year,” Kakode said. There will also be an increase in assured price of sugarcane to Rs 3000.
