At a time when the nation's   is facing a   and he government has failed to nitiate any special scheme or incentive for mechanised arming, the budgetary allocations have done little to disrupt the status quo.

 The government has sad it would draw a model law or contract farming in consent with states.
 
 The 60-day interest rate waiver scheme for farmers has been repeated in the Budget, as Prime Minister   had already announced in December.
 
 Union finance minister   announced a series of measures for pushing the farm sector growth from the existing below 2% to over 4% in financial year of 2017-18. However, no revolutionary steps have been taken for the sector almost crippled due to lack of funds, labour crisis and reluctance of small and marginal farmers, in going for mechanized farming.
 
 There is relief for farmers with farm loan allocation being increased to Rs 10 lakh crore and crop insurance allotment to Rs 9,000 crore. In view of frequent droughts and poor monsoon, the crop insurance scheme getting Rs 9,000 crore would come as a safety net.
 
 To make funds and credits available to farmers, the Budget has promised Rs 1,900 crore in three years for computerization and integration of the primary cooperative credit societies but that would hardly directly benefit small and marginal farmers immediately.
