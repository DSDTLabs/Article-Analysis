CHANDIGARH: After the Supreme Court verdict in the 1988 road rage case,   on Tuesday demanded   local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation on moral grounds.

 Union minister Vijay Sampla, BJP vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna and former secretary Harjit Singh Grewal said   should quit as he has been convicted by the country’s top court for voluntarily causing hurt. “Any form of violence is against the tenets of Sikhism. Sidhu represents the holy city of Amritsar, which is the land of the great Gurus who always fought against injustice, oppression and violence. Since he has been convicted in a case involving violence, he should resign on moral grounds”, they said in a press statement.
 
 The BJP leaders also questioned the silence of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Sunil Jakhar on Sidhu’s conviction.
