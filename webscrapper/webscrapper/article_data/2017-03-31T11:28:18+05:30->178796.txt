VISAKHAPATNAM:   in the port city are finding out the hard way that the ease of doing business is not as easy it sounds to be! Vizag has witnessed more than 20 food trucks setting up shop during the last one year offering a variety of choice to foodies but for them, the business atmosphere is not encouraging. 

 First, the food truck operators are being forced to move from one street to another due to various reasons including traffic, complaints from neighbouring establishments or for making way for VIP movement. Food trucks were spotted in three major locations in the city including at Vuda Park, MVP Colony and the road abutting  . 
 
 Explaining the problem, one of the food truck operators who was earlier located near Vuda Complex, said, “We were told to move out of the road as it was affecting traffic movement and causing disturbance to neighbours. If there is a dedicated space for food trucks, it will help business to go on smoothly.” 
 
 “We have invested quite a lot into the business for purchasing the food trucks and mounting additional cooking equipment accessories. It is not good if business gets disrupted,” he said. 
 
 Another operator said, “We are making sure that sanitation is not an issue. We are placing bins close to our food trucks and clearing up waste left by customers. Also, there are large number of customers who visit us but suddenly find that we are not in our street and some of them have even called to ask, where have we shifted.” He said, “We want to cooperate with the authorities, but we also need a solution so that we can have designated space to do our business.”
 
 However, referring to the incident, a police official said, “Following awareness on using apps for airing grievances to the police department, people are sending photos of problems they are facing with the food trucks due to which action has to be taken.” “Our main aim is that there should not be any inconvenience to the public,” he added.
