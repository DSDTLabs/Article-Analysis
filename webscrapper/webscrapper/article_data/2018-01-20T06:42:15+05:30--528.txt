HYDERABAD: Though he can’t drive the BMW sedan for three years,   can collect his vehicle from   traffic police station after paying the fine imposed by court. However, fearing jail term, over 3,000   offenders have abandoned their vehicles, including Royal Enfield motorcycles to cushy sedans, with the police.

 In the past one-and-half-years, offenders caught for drunk driving have abandoned 3,421 vehicles including 2,995 two wheelers, 67 four wheelers, 415 autos and DCM vans with the traffic police.
 
 
 Enforcement against drunk driving came a long way since traffic police started implementing it systematically in November 2011.
 
 The checks which used to be conducted only during weekends, was extended throughout the week. Checks during the day were also started. Police also started collecting evidence from the offender in the form of video recording, vehicle details, phone number and also Aadhaar details.
 
 Due to the effective enforcement, most offenders with Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) over 150 mg /100 ml and repeat offenders started receiving prison sentence.
 
 The fear of prison sentence and possibility of losing jobs, during antecedent verification checks, has made several offenders to abandon their vehicles.
 
 “Truck or DCM drivers from other states sometimes abandon the vehicles without informing the vehicle owners. Most of the four wheelers and two wheelers that are abandoned are of less value like scooters or old vehicles. But the fear of prison sometimes makes offenders abandon new vehicles,” DCP (traffic) A V Ranganath told TOI.
 
 Offenders think police would not be able to catch them if they abandon vehicles. “If the offender abandons the vehicle and does not come for counselling, we send notices to the address of the owner. If there is no response, we inform the court, file a chargesheet. If the whereabouts are not known then after informing court, vehicles are auctioned,” the DCP said.
