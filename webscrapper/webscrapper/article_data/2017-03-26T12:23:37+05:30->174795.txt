NAGPUR: The   is yet to announce the results of the first-semester Bachelor of Arts (BA) students even over two months after the exam. Ironically, the timetable for the second-semester   has been uploaded on the NU website, leaving students in a quandary.

 Director,   and  , Neeraj Khaty attributed the inordinate delay to factors like introduction of semester pattern and holding back of internal assessment (IA) marks by colleges. “Only BA results are pending from the Winter 2016 exam. Results for rest all courses have been declared. BA first-semester result too would be declared in a couple of days,” Khaty told TOI.
 
 He said there are more than 50 subjects in BA first-year, and they are dealing with huge data in the new system. “This was the first exam after introduction of semester pattern. The colleges didn’t send internal assessment marks on time. This led to withholding of results of more than 3,500 students. We can’t declare the entire course result in such circumstances,” he said.
 
 The delay in first-semester results and announcement of summer exam timetable has brought many students under pressure.
 
 “The university is not acting in the interest of students. They are under immense pressure and state of confusion as there is no clear picture. The next exam is fast approaching but they can’t precisely plan their preparation. There is a possibility that some students would need to appear in backlog papers. How will such students decide at the last moment?” An undergraduate teacher asked.
 
 Another lecturer admitted that colleges are at fault but their numbers must be somewhere around 40 to 50. “The university should identify such colleges and serve them notice for the delay. Or they could have announced the results of those who completed the process on time. 
 
 The valuation process was over by January, but the announcement of results has long missed the deadline of 45 days.”
 
 A senior faculty member said NU can’t be blamed in at least this case, and colleges must adapt to changes quickly. “The valuers too need to take their job seriously so that delays can be avoided.”
