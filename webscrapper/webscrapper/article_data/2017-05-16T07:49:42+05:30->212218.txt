Chandrapur: Investigations into the death of three tendu leaves collectors in the   attack and subsequent killing of the animal in Talodhi range on Saturday have revealed that the beast turned violent following the axe injury inflicted by one of the victims.

 The search operation launched in the surrounding forest area to check whether the bear had any cubs too have borne no fruits so far.
 
 The animal was shot dead amid mounting pressure by a mob of villagers to save two persons, who were stuck on a tree under which the animal was lurking. Post mortem confirmed the axe wound on the chest of the bear.
 
 Forest officials said the sudden injury inflicted by the fleeing tendu collectors might have turned the bear violent. The animal became so violent that it attacked other villagers, who came searching for her after the injured were removed.

 In the meantime, search parties of Bramhapuri forest division have failed to locate the missing cubs of the killed sloth bear. Post mortem reports have confirmed that the bear was lactating and doctors speculate that it was bearing 6-8 months old cubs.
