THRISSUR: Police team probing the death of engineering student   said the forensic laboratory had informed them that a DNA test could not be conducted on the blood samples that were collected from different rooms at  . Senior police officers supervising the probe said that technicians at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram said that the quantity of the sample was inadequate for conducting the test. 

 Initially, forensic tests were carried out on the blood samples taken from the office of the   (NCERC), Pampady where the deceased engineering student was studying. These tests had indicated that they were similar to Jishnu's, lending credence to the suspicion that he was tortured before death.
 
 Following this, the investigating team wanted to conduct a DNA test that was expected to confirm whether the blood traces detected in the college room were that of Jishnu.
 
 "Officers investigating the case had said so when they came to our home with a proposal to do a DNA test. The team had then collected blood samples from Ashokan and Mahija to conduct the test," said Jishnu's uncle Sreejith. Sources said that now the investigating team will have to rely on other evidence to continue the probe.
 
 However, family members suspect that the leak of the forensic report was part of a design to sabotage the investigation. "The information we received from medical experts said that there are modern methods that can conduct DNA tests even with a limited quantity sample," said Sreejith.
