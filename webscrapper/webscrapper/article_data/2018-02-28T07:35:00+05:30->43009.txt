BATHINDA: Union food processing industry minister   on Tuesday said the Congress and cancer of corruption were synonymous and it could simply be described as ‘C for Congress, c for Captain, c for Cancer and c for corruption.’

 She was commenting about the case registered by the CBI in the Rs 109-crore fraud by Simbhaoli Sugars in which Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s son-in-law Gurpal Singh is an accused.
 
 After flagging off a flight to Jammu from Bathinda airport, Harsimrat alleged, “The Congress is known for corruption more than any other thing. There is a long list of scams unearthed during the Congress government in Punjab, including the   scam and intranet scam. Earlier, the accounts of Amarinder’s wife had come to light in the Swiss banks and now his son-in-law has figured in the CBI case for fraud. All this points towards how corruption is part of the Congress culture.”
 
 Later, Harsimrat, along with her father-in-law and former CM Parkash Singh Badal, inaugurated the liaison office of the   and food processing business incubation-cum-training centre at Bathinda. She also presided over a workshop on ‘opportunities in food processing sector’ wherein representatives from various industries and farmers participated.
 
 Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MP Hasimrat said times were changing and farmers needed to diversify, for which the food processing industry could be the best option as it had a lot of potential. She spoke about various schemes of her ministry and asked the farmers to go for small businesses, including making various items, for value addition. She said various items were being made from milk and fruits.
 
 Former CM Badal said since jobs were limited, the youth needed to get vocational training. “Food processing sector has a lot of scope for Punjab farmers who can make money by processing their produce.” He stressed on the need to develop Punjab as a food processing hub.
