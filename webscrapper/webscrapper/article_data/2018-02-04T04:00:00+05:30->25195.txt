Vadodara: Various teaching and non-teaching staff associations apart from student outfits have condemned Friday’s incident in which Chandra Mohan, a former student of faculty of fine arts, set the university head office on fire. 

 While condemning the action of the former student, Maharaja Sayajirao Vishvavidyalaya Shaikshik Sangh (MSVSS), Baroda University Teachers Association (BUTA), Baroda University Staff Association (BUSA) have also demanded that the university take immediate steps to ensure safety and security of university officials and students. 
 
 “The incident has not only led to huge loss of material property but has also created an environment of fear among the stakeholders,” a representation made by MSVSS stated. 
 
 The associations have also condemned the action taken by the cops who had picked up D K Patel, a senior teacher of faculty of science amid the commotion at the university head office on Friday. 
 
 Patel was questioning the university’s preparedness to handle such emergencies when cops who were present at the spot picked him up without citing any reason. 
 
 Both MSVSS and BUTA have condemned the police action calling it an unwanted and an unruly act of the officials. 
 
 Members of ABVP on the other hand submitted a memorandum to district collector demanding strict action in the incident.
