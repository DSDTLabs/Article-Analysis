GREATER NOIDA: Actor   came to the city to promote his movie   on Wednesday even though the district administration had cancelled the event. However, the actor’s chopper had to land at Gautam Buddha University instead of   where the event was held without adequate security.

 The actor had to be brought by road for the event, which lasted only for 20 minutes, after which he visited other private universities and the Auto EXPO to promote his film.
 
 With the venue of the helipad changing and permission being denied by the district administration, the students were informed at the last moment that Akshay would arrive at the Galgotias university around 2 pm.
 
 “He was here only for 20 minutes and left soon after. It was not the initial plan,” said a B Tech first year student who attended the event. 
 
 Earlier, the students were called to the main ground of the university around 10 am.
 
 However, the plan was changed due to the public works department (PWD) denying permission to the proposed helipad and the police denying availability of any additional force for the event.
 
 PWD officers said they had not inspected the new helipad for the event.
 
 Vimal Kumar, executive engineer, PWD told TOI, “We got to know that the chopper landed at the helipad of   but we had not inspected it. We had inspected it last when the chief minister’s chopper landed there when he was in Greater Noida for the inauguration of the National Youth Festival.” 
 
 When contacted, Greater Noida city magistrate Rajesh Sharma claimed he was unaware that the event was being held.
 
 Awadhesh Kumar, dean (planning) of the university, said that the event management company changed the plan and landed the chopper at GBU’s helipad.
