THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former state police chief   has said that he was removed from the state DGP's post by the   as an act of revenge.

 In a   (SLP) filed before the   against the high court order upholding the government decision to remove him, Senkumar has said the high court had observed in the order that action had been taken based on untested and unverified facts. Hence the order of the government changing him as the state police chief should be quashed, he contended.
 
 The SLP also pointed out that the government had taken action based on the 'false report' given by the home secretary regarding investigations into the Jisha murder case and the Puttingal fire tragedy.
 
 The petition also pointed out that he had given hints against   in the Shukkur murder case and T P Chandrashekaran murder case, and this had resulted in shifting him from the state police chief post when the CPM came to power.
 
 He also claimed that when he was the state police chief there was only one political murder reported in Kannur and in the last nine months it had multiplied three or four times.
 
 He has requested the SC to give necessary directive on whether a police officer should act according to political will or based on constitution.
 
 Earlier Senkumar had contended in the HC that the decision of the government to transfer him from the post of the state police chief and post him as chairman and managing director, Kerala Police Housing and Construction Corporation, on deputation was illegal.
 
 However, the government had argued that the petitioner had tarnished the image of the police by refusing to take action against the delinquent officers in the Puttingal fire tragedy and was callous and insensitive to the investigation into the dalit woman's murder at Perumbavoor.
