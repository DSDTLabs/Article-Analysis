Vadodara: A 56-year-old   and her 61-year-old family friend were found murdered on the outskirts of Sangma village in Padra taluka on Saturday afternoon.

 Police suspect that the deceased Pravina Patel and Natu Panchal were killed in connection with a land feud. Patel and her husband Ramesh have their land in Sangma over which an internal dispute has been going on since many years, police said. Currently, the murder case has been registered against unidentified persons.
 
 A police official said that the killer’s target should have been Patel and her husband, but they must have confused Panchal with Ramesh and killed him. Ramesh had gone to market to sell their farm produce when the crime took place. The couple lives in Bharuch, but they regularly visit their farm in Sangma.
 
 According to police, the couple was planning to make a gate for their land for which Panchal, a retired GEB staffer, came to their village to offer his help. After harvesting cucumber from their farm, while Ramesh went to the market, Patel and Panchal were to going get tiffin for lunch. Police said that on their way, the duo was killed.
 
 As the police learnt about the bodies, they reached the spot along with forensic experts and dog squad. Their family members were also informed once the identification of the bodies was done.
 
 “Either the killer knew Panchal or he was confused with Ramesh therefore he was killed,” said the police official.
