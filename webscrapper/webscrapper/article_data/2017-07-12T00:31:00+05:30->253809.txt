 Ambala: Former Army men held a protest at Ambala to condemn the attack against   pilgrims at Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 The ex-servicemen raised slogans against Pakistan and blamed it for the Anantnag attack that left seven pilgrims killed and about a dozen people injured.
 
 The protesters, headed by Antar Singh Multani, also burnt the flag of Pakistan and asked the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take strict action against the attackers.
 
 They said the government should not just condemn the attack, but should allow the Indian Army to destroy all the terrorist camps in Pakistan.
 
 Raising questions about the security for the pilgrims, they accused the government of not providing appropriate security even though the Intelligence Bureau had recently gave a tip off about a series of attacks at crowded places in India.
 
 Multani said attacking innocent pilgrims was not only condemnable but also cowardly act. He said, “The attack on innocent people was a cowardly act. Till when would we tolerate these attacks by the enemy nation and would not take action against them.”
