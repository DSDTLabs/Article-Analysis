BHUBANESWAR: Summer is round the corner and the government is all set to bring back the low floor AC buses on the airport-Nandankanan route. 

 In 2014, these buses were introduced to beat the heat but three months ago, four of the buses developed technical snags and the service had to be withdrawn. 
 
 The airport-Nandankanan stretch is one of the longest routes in the city passing through areas like AG Square, Governor House, Power House Square, 120 battalion,  , Kalinga Hospital, Damana Square, Infocity Square, Patia Square and KIIT Square.
 
 The Bhubaneswar-Puri Transport Services Limited ( ) on Tuesday at its board meeting decided to relaunch the service keeping in mind the unbearable temperatures of summer. 
 
 "The low-floor AC buses will be ready within two weeks. We hired technical experts to repair them. Since their introduction, the buses have been a big hit," said   mayor Ananta Narayan Jena.
 
 These buses are convenient for the physically challenged, too, Jena said. 
 
 "They can board them without support. Eight other buses are running on the Bhubaneswar-Puri and Bhubaneswar-Cuttack routes," the mayor said.
 
 Around 33,000 people travel in 102 intra-city buses every day on more than 200 routes. The BPTSL has decided to increase the routes so that other areas are also covered.
 
  "A transport consultant will be hired by the BPTSL to conduct a survey to find newer routes," said an official after the meeting.
 
 It was also decided that GPS-enabled Vehicle Tracking System would be introduced from April. GPS will be installed in the existing 150 buses and the 500 additional buses to be procured under the smart city mobility programme.
