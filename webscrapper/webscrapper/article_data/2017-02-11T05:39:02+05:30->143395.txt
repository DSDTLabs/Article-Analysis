CHENNAI: A day after telling the Madras high court that many   legislators were not under illegal confinement and were at the government MLAs hostel in Chennai, the state government on Friday admitted in court that it was an 'incorrect' statement. 

 A submission to this effect was made by the Tamil Nadu public prosecutor before a division bench of Justice C T Selvam and Justice T Mathivanan.
 
 The bench also took note of an allegation that 20 MLAs under confinement were on fast, and said: "K Balu submits that 20 of the MLAs are refusing food and drink owing to their illegal confinement. If true, the matter is one of serious concern. However, this court cannot act on the mere say of the counsel.
 
 Given the nature of the case, it would only be appropriate to afford the state an opportunity to inform its response." It adjourned the case to February 13 for further proceedings.
 
 On Thursday, Balu and social activist K R 'Traffic' Ramaswamy mentioned the 'detentions' before a bench of Justice M Jaichandran and Justice Mathivanan and sought urgent hearing of habeas corpus petitions on the MLAs's safety.
