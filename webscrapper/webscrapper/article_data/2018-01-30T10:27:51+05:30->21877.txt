Kochi: The air in   is much cleaner than many cities in the country, according to the latest   report 'Airpocalypse II', which was released on Monday. The report pointed out that Kerala was the only state where ambient air quality in all its cities and towns was within the limits prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (through National Ambient Air Quality Standards).

 "We have found that Kerala has managed to keep the PM10 (particulate matter in air of 10 microns and smaller) standards,"said  , senior campaigner,   India. However, it is much above the WHO limits, which is another indicator of the safe air quality for a person to live in. 
 
 "Kerala's pollution levels more or less remained consistent between 2015 and 2016 with slight upside variation in few cities such as Kochi, Thrissur, Wayanad and Kozhikode along with slight decrease for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Malappuram and  ," he said.
 
 The state could set an example for the rest of the states with a time-bound regional action plan to achieve the international standard and become Clean Air Champion state,   added.
 
 Kerala pollution control board chairman   said that the state has taken its ambient air quality monitoring seriously. "We have five real-time (RT) monitoring stations -- three in Kochi and one each in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Three more will come up in Kollam, Thrissur and Kannur," he said.
 
 He added that engineers were being appointed in place of ITI graduates to monitor and report the data at RT stations to cross-check anomalies. "We plan to establish RT stations in every district and install the latest instrument at appropriate places," Sajeevan said.
 
 The report noted that southern cities were slightly better off than its northern counterparts. However, the former needed proper plan to achieve WHO standards, it said.
