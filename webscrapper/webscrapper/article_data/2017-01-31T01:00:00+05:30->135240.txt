After finishing off with the villain Gamosha, 'Trideviyaan' —   (Aishwarya Sakhuja),   ( ) and   ( ) — will have to retrieve a precious diamond from   that is stolen by a thief in India, in the upcoming track of the show Trideviyaan. 
The police force lead by Shaurya (Anshul Trivedi) have been assigned the responsibility of looking after a pink diamond worth 600 crores. It will be displayed at an art exhibition. On Dinanath’s (Rituraj Singh) instructions, Trideviyaan have to assist Shaurya in keeping the diamond safe and disguise themselves to enter the exhibition. So, Manu becomes a statue (Sonpari) at the exhibition, with Dhanu and Tanu disguised as its owners — Bade and Chote Miyyan — respectively. The drama unfolds when the thief robs the diamond and hides the diamond inside a bun. But, Manu unknowingly feeds the same bun to a dog that appears on the scene. The dog falls sick. Trideviyaan take him to a vet where they come to know that he has swallowed the diamond. They decide to take the dog to Chauhan house. And the biggest challenge is to hide the dog from Garv (Winy Tripathi)) who is allergic to dogs. 
 Shalini said, “Three girls decide to help Shaurya keep the diamond safe but their efforts backfire when a dog swallows the diamond. The naughty dog is a problem and hiding him from everyone is quite hillarious.” 
 'Trideviyaan' airs from Monday-Friday, at 9.30 pm on Sony SAB.
