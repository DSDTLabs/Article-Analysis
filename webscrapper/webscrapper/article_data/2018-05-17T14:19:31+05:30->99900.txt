PATNA: Perhaps taking a cue from the recent murder of two rail passengers along the tracks near  , the government rail police has increased   on rail tracks between Rajendra Nagar terminal and Mithapur overbridge.

 “Five government rail police (GRP) personnel, who used to patrol between railway tracks from outer signal on eastern end of   to the terminal, have been diverted to the Mithapur area. These personnel will now conduct routine patrolling on rail tracks between western end of the junction and Mithapur overbridge. Ten additional armed police personnel, on the other hand, will patrol between eastern end of Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar terminal. A temporary tent has been set up at Kathpul for the BMP personnel,” superintendent of rail police (SRP), Patna, Ashok Kumar Singh said.
 
 It was at Kathpul that two rail passengers –   (32) and   (37) –were stabbed to death in two separate incidents in the wee hours of May 8.
