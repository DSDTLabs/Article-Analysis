GAYA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday reviewed the security arrangements of Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya.

 Though official account of the review meet is not available, sources say the CM is unhappy with the lapses that led to a minor blast and recovery of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) despite the presence of nearly 3000 cops to provide security cover to the Dalai Lama.
 
 Those present at the meet included deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, DGP PK Thakur, principal secretary, home, Aamir Subhani, zonal IG Naiyyar Hasnain Khan, Magadh commissioner Jitendra Srivastava, range DIG Vinay Kumar, district magistrate Abhishekh Singh and SSP Garima Malik.
 
 Earlier, the CM ordered strengthening of the security infrastructure including barrack construction and establishment of watch towers and additional CCTVs for effective observation of movements and activities taking place in the shrine vicinity.
 
 Sources now say that the earlier proposal to hand over shrine security to the CISF has been shelved and the BMP will continue to provide security cover. In fact, BMP deployment is likely to be further strengthened to cater to the requirements of proper security.The BMP, according to officials, is doing a good job and unlike 2013, the saboteurs could not cross the shrine main entrance and abandoned the explosives outside.
