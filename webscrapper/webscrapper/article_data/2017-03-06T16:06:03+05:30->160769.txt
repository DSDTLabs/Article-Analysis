Bollywood actors   and   recently turned show stoppers for Mijwan Summer 2017, a fundraiser charity show presented by  .

 The ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’ stars wowed the audience as they walked the ramp in colour coordinated   creations. While the Baadshah looked majestic in a white chikankari sherwani with black threadwork, Anushka walked the ramp in a sequined lehenga and a dazzling crop top with fringe details.
 
 After the show, SRK who is in awe of his co-star said, “A big thanks to Anushka for standing by me and making me look as beautiful as I look right now. It’s only because of her”. He quickly added, “and just for Mijwan”, before proceeding to croon to his song ‘Mitwa’ from ‘Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna’ by replacing ‘Mitwa’ with ‘Mijwan’. Whilst singing, he recreated his trademark arms-wide-open step. Isn’t he the cutest? Shah Rukh and Anushka will be soon seen in Imtiaz Ali’s upcoming film ‘Rehnuma’.
