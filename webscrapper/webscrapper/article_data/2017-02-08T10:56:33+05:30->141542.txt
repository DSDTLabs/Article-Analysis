AMRAVATI: It appears the   has its task cut out in getting the revised estimates of the mega   approved by the Centre. In its latest estimate, the government has pegged the project cost at Rs 40,200 crore -almost twoand-half times over and above the initial Rs 16,010.45 crore estimated in 2011.

 Sources said the government is yet to furnish details of the revised estimates to the Centre. Union minister of state for water resources   disclosed in the   on Monday that they have not received the revised figure. The original cost of the multi-purpose cleared by the Planning Commission in 2006 was Rs 10,151.04 crore and later it was revised to Rs 16,010.45 crore in 2011.
 
 The state government claimed it would require nearly Rs 20,000 crore for acquisition of land alone. Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu recently kicked off concrete works and promised to complete the project's first phase before 2019 general elections. “Even the resettlement and rehabilitation package runs into thousands of crores. Hence, the project cost has escalated to Rs 40,200 crore,“ a senior irrigation official said.
 
 Government sources said the state cabinet had approved the revised cost and asked the water resources department to approach the Centre with the new estimates. “It is no big issue. The Centre has promised to extend 100 per cent funding to the project. Revision of estimates is a regular process and we will get the Centre's approval for the latest cost estimates also,“ water resources minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao said. The Centre, unable to make direct budgetary allocation to the project, has tied up with Nabard to fund irrigation projects of national interest.
 
 While Nabard will grant the loan from time to time to the state government, the Centre will repay the loan.
