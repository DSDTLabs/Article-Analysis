PATNA: Life returned to   ( ) campus on Tuesday with the reopening of all its constituent colleges and postgraduate departments after 10 daysâ€™ Christmas holidays. Students and faculty members of different institutions were seen exchanging pleasantries and new year greetings with friends and colleagues.

 The attendance of students in most departments was, however, very thin as several students had not returned from their homes. Besides, the inclement weather also prevented the students from coming to colleges and departments. The attendance was likely to pick up in a day or two, said a senior   teacher.
 
 Meanwhile, the proposed January 10 visit of President   in connection with the valedictory function of the PU centenary celebrations has been postponed due to some unavoidable circumstances. Now, he is expected to visit the campus on February 8.
 
 Student union polls: PU has decided to initiate the process of student union polls on January 10. The electoral roll is under preparation and will be published soon. The elections are likely to be held before Republic Day.
