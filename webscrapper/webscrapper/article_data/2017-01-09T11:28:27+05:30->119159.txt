PATNA:   conditions in the region disrupted   on Sunday. The 12309 Patna-New Delhi   was cancelled due to abnormal late running of Rajdhani Express from New Delhi end. 

 The Railways also rescheduled departure of a few pairs of trains from Patna Junction on Sunday. These trains included Sampoorn Kranti Express, Jansadharan Express, Shramjeevi Express and Magadh Express. The East Central Railway (ECR) has deployed fog signal men at all vulnerable places in Danapur division for safety of passengers. The New Delhi-Allahabad-Patna-Howrah mainline route is the worst affected. Dense fog in the entire stretch between Tundala and Allahabad under Allahabad division of North Central Railway is hampering movement of Patna-bound trains.
 
 ECR CPRO Arvind Rajak said detonators (fog signals) have been supplied in bulk in the division as part of winter safety measures. “About 30 long distance trains originating from northern region, particularly New Delhi, were delayed for several hours on Sunday. Premier trains like Vikramshila Express, Sampoorn Kranti Express, Poorva Express, Farakka Express and Magadh Express were delayed due to foggy weather condition,” Rajak said.
 
 He added that dense fog in northern region was responsible for slow movement of trains. In Bihar, train services have been hit due to dense fog between Kuchman and Buxar on the mainline section of Danapur division as well as Mokama Tal area. “Trains have been running at a speed of 60 kmph only during night hours. Night track patrolling is being carried out under the supervision of safety officers,” Rajak said.
 
 According to a Railway Board official, visibility is so poor on the Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad route that Railways avoid running trains. “Loco pilots cannot take risk during zero visibility,” he said, adding that Railways has no choice but to follow safety rules strictly.
