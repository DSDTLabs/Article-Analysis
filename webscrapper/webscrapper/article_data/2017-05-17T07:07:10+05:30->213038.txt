BENGALURU: A labourer from Nepal has been arrested for allegedly killing a 20-year-old woman, who was his compatriot, by smashing her head with a boulder near Sompura Gate, Sarjapur Main Road, earlier this month. Police said Tilak killed his acquaintance, Pavitra, over money. 

  Pavitra had married Karan, a security guard in the city, and moved to Bengaluru two years ago. They had rented a house near Sompura Gate. Pavitra worked as a domestic help. She met Tilak, a labourer from her village, who lived in the same area. 
 
 A few months ago, when Tilak was in severe financial crisis, she lent him Rs 8,000. Even though months passed, Tilak didn't return the money. Furious over this, she went to the under-construction building where Tilak was working on May 4. Both had an argument and a furious Tilak attacked her. When she fell on the ground, he took a boulder and dropped it on her head. Later, he buried her body in the same site. 
 
 Unable to find Pavitra, Karan filed a police complaint. Police questioned Tilak and as suspicion grew, they took him into custody. Tilak confessed to the murder and showed cops where he buried Pavitra's body.
