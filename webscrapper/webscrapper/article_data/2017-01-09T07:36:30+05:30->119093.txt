BENGALURU: In a bid to expand its   (PNG) network across Bengaluru, GAIL (India) Limited has tied up with builders and developers to supply natural gas to apartment blocks and  . GAIL has been making efforts to increase the use of PNG, which is a cleaner and cheaper alternative to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 

 The use of natural gas in Bengaluru is largely restricted to vehicles – mostly autorickshaws – and independent houses. However, GAIL has been laying pipelines across the city to increase its utilization. A senior official at GAIL said, “In the next few months, we will take piped gas to more than 20,000 flats in the city. We are currently in the process of fulfilling certain statutory requirements. Many apartment associations, builders and gated communities are eager to switch to PNG.”
 
 The official said leading real estate developers in the city had expressed interest in equipping their apartment complexes with PNG facility. “One of the builders has 11,500 housing units across the city, while another has 2,400 apartment units near Hebbal. These developers are keen on receiving PNG supply,” Jana added.
 
 GAIL Gas, a subsidiary of GAIL, is already supplying PNG to residential and commercial buildings in HSR Layout, Bellandur, Singasandra, Dollars Colony (near RMV Extension) and Mangammanapalya. “We have infrastructure in place to supply natural gas to more than 3,500 individual units. Moreover, the number of people opting for   has been rising steadily – over 12,000 households have registered with us in the past six months. Our aim is to bring 1.32 lakh housing units in the city under the PNG network, which will be spread over 4,395sqkm across both Bengaluru Rural and Bengaluru Urban districts, by 2020,” said a senior manager at GAIL.
 
 The Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) township in north Bengaluru is already connected to the PNG network in the city, as is Jindal Colony, besides other industrial hubs such as Bellandur and Singasandra. 
 
 The city receives natural gas from the 1,178-km Dabhol-Bengaluru gas pipeline. Compressed natural gas is sold at Rs 22 per standard cubic metre, which translates to around Rs 43/kg. GAIL’s PNG network in the city covers 600km, and the company is planning to extend it to 1,800km in the next three years. GAIL gas is endeavouring to set up as many as 12 CNG stations by the end of this year.
