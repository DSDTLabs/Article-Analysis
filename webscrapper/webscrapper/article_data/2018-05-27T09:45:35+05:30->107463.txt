MUSSOORIE: A ‘Himalayan Cleanup’ drive conducted by the state forest department, Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) and Dehradun-based think tank Gati Foundation on Saturday at Company Bagh in the hill town revealed that more than 50% of the trash thrown along the tourist-centric hillside comprised of plastic. The findings came to the fore after an audit done by Gati Foundation found that chips, biscuit wrappers and tetrapacks of various soft drinks comprised the bulk of the plastic waste.
 
  The drive was part of a similar drive organised across 10 mountain states of India as a run up to World Environment Day.
  
  Anoop Nautiyal, founder, Gati Foundation told TOI, “The main focus of the cleanup was on the concept of ‘Extended Producer Responsibility’, which places the onus on manufacturers to take responsibility of the plastic generated during the entire lifecycle of the product, an important element of the   Rule 2016.”
  
  A number of other organisations like Waste Warriors, Tibetan School, Doon University as well as volunteers also participated in the drive. “The audit data will be presented to policy makers who are chalking out guidelines to make manufacturers accountable for their products and the waste generated through them, “ said Avinash Pratap Singh, chief operating officer of Waste Warriors.
