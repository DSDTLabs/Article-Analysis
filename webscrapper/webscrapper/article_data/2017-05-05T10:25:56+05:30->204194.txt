HYDERABAD: Not just public spaces, even government offices, schools, hospitals and several other   were found to be `overwhelmingly unfriendly' to   (PWDs).

 Malls in the city fared better with larger entrances and ramps, says a new study. “How accessible are our public spaces for PWDs? An access study of Cyberabad“ done by the  , Tata Institute of Social Sciences Hyderabad analysed 211 places and found only 30 to 40 of them having some accessibility features. 
 
 Bus stands, railway stations, clinics,   fared the worst during the study. Raheja Mindspace bus stop has ACs and ATMs, but no accessibility feature for the differently-abled.
 
 The study was led by Dr Ipsita Sapra, associate professor and Dr Amit Upadhyay, assistant professor. The study covered educational institutions, hospitals, government institutions such as  , police stations, banks, bus stops, railway stations, malls, markets and leisure spaces. The study was released on Thursday during the TISS convocation 2017.
