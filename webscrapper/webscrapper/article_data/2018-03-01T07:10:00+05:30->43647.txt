Ludhiana: Burglars broke into a mobile shop in Ghai market, Jamalpur, in the early hours of Wednesday and escaped with cash, cell-phones and other gadgets. 
 
 Even as the CCTV cameras installed in the shop have captured only one thief, the police suspect more miscreants might be involved in the loot. 
  
 The shop owner, Manvinder Singh, said in his police complaint, “I had closed the shop around 9.30pm on Tuesday. When I opened it on Wednesday morning, I found it ransacked. Besides Rs 20,000, thieves made off with 50 cell-phones and a laptop. I have suffered a loss of Rs 8 lakh.” 
  
 The burglars entered the shop from its roof. 
  
 Jamalpur police station SHO sub-inspector Avtar Singh said, “From an adjoining store, the thieves jumped on to the shop’s roof and broke open the door. They then climbed down with a ladder. The CCTV cameras installed in the shop have captured only one suspect. But it seems to be the handiwork of more people. We have recovered a ladder, an iron rod and a hammer which the burglars used to gain access to the outlet.” 
  
 Manvinder claimed that this was the eighth loot at his shop in the past 13 years. 
  
 A case has been registered.
