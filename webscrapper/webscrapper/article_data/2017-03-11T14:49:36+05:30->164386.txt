BHOPAL: Worrying about clouds of a marital discord threatening to rip your life apart and the matter is about to reach court? Take heart, a team of seven women advocates from Bhopal district court, has taken it upon itself to offer a solution, a legal advice when somebody needs it. All for free.

 The team of 7 advocates has come as a ‘Rainbow’ amid dark clouds and has been named so. It will help complainants and applicants at the court to give them the right legal advice. The group of 7 advocates was formed on the International Women’s Day and has support of other lawyers of District Bar Association.
 
 “There are several cases. Many people lack direction. On many occasions, they take a wrong path leading to worsening of situation. They need people, who can sit with them and talk to them to find out rather than suggesting sections of law book. Our idea is to stop it and anyone who wants to join in voluntarily can do so and help people,” said  , vice-president, District Bar Association.
 
 Going by records of district court, Bhopal, there are three family courts and each daily gets about 10 cases for hearing.
 
 Chaudhary said, “Several false cases are being registered to harass men. The team will focus on them so that they don’t suffer after coming to family court.” Members include advocates Sunita Rajput,  , Himangi Arora, Annapurna Rawat, Priya Shrivastava and  .
 
 The team has decided not to restrict itself to Bhopal district court. “There are several cases, which do not reach court. We are open to the idea of any NGO or State Women’s Commission or   (SCPCR) coming forward to help people who need legal aid, but are either hesitant or have fears about court,” said members of the ‘Rainbow’.
