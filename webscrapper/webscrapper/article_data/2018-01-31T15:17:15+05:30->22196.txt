Visakhapatnam: Society is no stranger to myths, taboos and superstitions surrounding eclipses, especially with regards to its effect on pregnant women and unborn children. For instance, congenital birth defects such as cleft lip and palate are often attributed to the effects of eclipse. Ahead of the lunar   on January 31, doctors dispel such myths about the impact of eclipse on health.

 During an eclipse, people are advised to not to eat or drink, would-be mothers are warned against watching the eclipse, leaving the house, scratching themselves and or using the restroom. It is believed that failing to adhere to these mores could lead to children being born with birth defects.
 
 Rubbishing such claims, Dr MNV Pallavi, chief gynaecologist and laparoscopic surgeon at a city hospital said, “There is no scientific basis for such myths. There is no proof that rays emanating from lunar eclipse harm the foetus. There is no logical argument for not eating or drinking or not using the washroom during eclipses. However, watching the solar eclipses, when high intensity rays are emitted, with naked eyes can has an harmful effect.”
 
 Speaking about congenital anomalies and cleft lip in children, principal of Andhra Medical College and head of the department of plastic surgery at   (KGH), Dr PV Sudhakar said, “No congenital anomaly or cleft lip and palate has any connection with eclipses. Causes for the facial birth defect are multi-factorial, including consanguineous marriages (between blood relatives), genetic propensity or family history of clefts, malnutrition in mothers, usage of certain drugs or steroids during pregnancy, exposure to radiation and so on.”
 
  has condemned the socio-cultural taboos associated with eclipses. “Studies have proved that the link between facial birth defects with eclipses is a myth,” said N  , founder-secretary of PSI.
