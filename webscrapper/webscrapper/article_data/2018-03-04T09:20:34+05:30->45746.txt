AGARTALA: BJP’s poll formula, combining organisational strength and foolproof alliance equations, has proved successful. Leading the march in the north-east is Himanta Biswa Sarma. A former Congressman, the 48-year-old Assam minister crossed over to   in 2015 a few months before the state went to the polls. 

 The saffron party came to power in the north-east for the first time and has not looked back since. The North-East Democratic Alliance (Neda) — formed with the objective of creating a “ 
  north-east” — was the first step towards BJP’s expansion goal. Sarma is its convener and has been responsible for arriving at the understandings that have favoured BJP’s growth. 
 
  
  
 
 He made a mark as kingmaker in Arunachal Pradesh,   and, now, Tripura. On Saturday, having seen to 
  , Sarma rushed to   in the afternoon. With   having a hung House, Sarma has taken his position on the battleground to ensure that a   government does not come to pass. 
 
 Sarma’s modus operandi is clear — break the rival and win its key leaders over to BJP. Like him, Manipur CM   and Arunachal Pradesh’s   were Congress leaders before. 
 
 “The influence of BJP was quite limited in the north-east. Unless new people joined, it couldn’t have grown in strength,” he said. He attributed BJP’s growth in the north-east to PM Modi’s development agenda. “For the first time, people have seen development at the local level. They have seen the huge investment by the government in rail, road and air connectivity,” he said. Striking the right alliance at the right time was critical. “BJP’s structure has been strengthened. Under Neda, a lot of regional parties have joined us,” he added.
