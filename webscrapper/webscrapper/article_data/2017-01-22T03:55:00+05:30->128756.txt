Nagpur: The Hudkeshwar police are still in the dark about the masked assailant who brutally stabbed Manorama Godbole (58) with a knife near her residence in Khankhoje Nagar on Thursday night.

 A section of cops feels that the attacker only intended to kill her as none of the valuables went missing.
 
 “We doubt that there were two assailants who chased the woman in the lane while she was walking towards her place,” said second PI Kishore Chaudhary.
 
 “Police, who have registered a case of attempt to murder against the unidentified assailant, are trying to procure the CCTV footage of the main road and the corner of the lane, where she was dropped by her flour mill owner on a two-wheeler,” Chaudhary added.
 
 The cops will also question locals as well as the flour mill owner.
 
 Manorama, who is recovering at the trauma center at GMCH, told TOI, “Two goons, who used to sit in front of the flour mill, demanded money a few months back but I refused. Later, I came to know from local residents that the duo had previous crime records.”
 
 Manorama had earlier scolded a group of youths for their misbehaviour.
 
 She living with husband Natthu, was has been working as a security guard at the flour mill since the last six years. Natthu was at work when the incident took place.
 
 Local residents rushed a bleeding Manorama to the GMCH and also informed her son Vasanta, who called on her cellphone to ask her whereabouts.
