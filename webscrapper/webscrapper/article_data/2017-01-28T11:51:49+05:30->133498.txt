GUWAHATI: None of the seven low-intensity bombs that exploded at different locations on   had been planted by members of the proscribed   (Independent). 

 Instead, the rebel outfit had outsourced the job to locals, a senior police officer said. Some of these locals had been identified and were being tracked, he added.
 
 Ulfa-I leader   had called up television channels early on Thursday morning and hinted at a series of blasts in public places on Republic Day in spite of high security.
 
 The first blast took place in Charaideo district bordering Nagaland at around 7.55am and the seventh, in Tinsukia around two hours later. In between, four blasts occurred in Charaideo and one each in  .
 
 "Ulfa-I wanted to scare people and keep them away from attending any Republic Day function. So they used low-intensity bombs that were planted at relatively isolated areas," the source said.
 
 "Security was very tight and there cannot be any Ulfa-I groups holed up inside the state. The planting of these bombs was outsourced to locals. We have identified some and we are after them," the source said.
 
 Ulfa-I, along with four Manipur-based groups,   and all other outfits of the region, had given a call to boycott Republic Day events. Police, however, claimed that people defied the threat and participated in celebrations in large numbers. "We put all our effort into providing security so that Republic Day could be celebrated not just in urban centres but across panchayats and it was a success," the source added.
