CHARMINAR: Despite there being strict laws, children have been spotted working at the   Exhibition-2018, Numaish. The Exhibition Society, which claims to run several educational institutions from the income generated by   and promises to educate poor children, fails every year to eradicate child labour from the fair, activists say.

 City-based NGO Balala Hakkula Sangham has called for renewed action against child labour. “We wonder why officials do not conduct Operation Smile at Numaish every year and rescue these children. Child labour is rampant at the fair and you can find children working in several stalls and food courts in the exhibition,” said Achyuta  , honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham. The child rights activist said this blatant violation of the law is despite several complaints being made to concerned officials.
 
 “Apart from the complaints that we have filed, the   issued notices to officials at labour department and secretary of the   for violating child rights in 2015, but not much has been done,” Rao said. “Authorities have turned a blind eye despite the matter being reported,” he alleged.
 
 When contacted, deputy commissioner of police ( ), D Joel Davis, said, “It has not come to our notice, yet but we will definitely verify it (use of child labour). It could be that families ask children from within the clan to help out because people come from different parts of the country set up stalls. But if children are being engaged in business activities we will find out.”
