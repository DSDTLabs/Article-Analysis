This one’s not a professional cricket team, but a group of   officials who “still have cricket left in them,” and practice almost daily at the Bharat Ground in Ashok Vihar. It is the same ground where  , who was cricketer Gautam Gambhir’s childhood coach, runs his own cricket academy. Bharadwaj is hence the unofficial coach of the Delhi Police’s cricket team.

 When DT visited the ground recently, the Delhi Police officials were gearing up for another cricket match. The captain of the team, Vijay Singh, DCP, Traffic, Outer District, says, “We practice after office in the evening. Yes, it is cold and foggy, but lately, we have been working very hard, and engaging in some net practice in the evenings for three to four hours.”
 Team India often requests   to schedule their practice sessions in evenings under the lights, but   doesn’t have a choice.
 
 Talking about the team, Singh adds, “I have formed this team, but the players keep changing. Last year, we had an annual tournament, in which senior officials of the department played, but they are not playing in this match.” He adds, “I won’t say that we are the best, but my teammates play well, despite irregular practice. Unlike other cricket teams, our strategies are formed just a few days before the match. This time, Sanjay is travelling with his young cricket players, but his tips come in handy for us. I won’t say that he is our regular coach, but he is with us, on and off.”
 When asked why the team practices at the Bharat Ground even though the   ground is closer to the Police Headquarters (PHQ), Singh says, “When I was posted as the DCP North-West, I used to come here daily after office to practice. I still come here with the team even after getting a transfer.’’
 
 Talking about the matches they have played, he says, “We played against the coal ministry team recently. It doesn’t matter whether we win or lose. The fact that we still have some cricket left in us is something that I feel is amazing.”
