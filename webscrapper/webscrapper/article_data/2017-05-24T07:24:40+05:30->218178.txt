New Delhi: The government on Tuesday used Twitter to respond to   founder Elon Musk’s concerns over local sourcing norms to set shop in India where it was planning an entry. On Monday, in response to a query,   had tweeted: “May be I’m misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply does not yet exist in India to support that.” A few hours later, the department of industrial policy and promotion, which fixes the FDI policy, issued a detailed clarification.

 “Not correct. FDI policy of India does not mandate any such minimum sourcing of components by manufacturers,” it said, adding that after manufacturing in the country, a foreign investor is entitled to sell in any manner — wholesale, retail and e-commerce. It also said that the FDI policy also allows wholesale trading in imported goods without any sourcing conditions. “It is only for retail trading of goods, that sourcing conditions are mandated. Conditions not applicable to manufacturers as goods are manufactured in India,”   tweeted. 
 
 Tesla has been engaged with the Indian government and its agencies over entering India, with the green car manufacturer earlier indicating that it would launch vehicles during 2017. In fact, several enthusiasts have made an advance booking for its much-awaited Model 3. Officials said they were surprised by Musk’s tweet since car manufacturers sell through dealers and not via the retail trading window. In addition, any company — even if they import their vehicles as completely-built units or in kits that are assembled in the country to save on import duty — needs to put in place a service network. In case of Tesla, all components will need to be imported as the supply chain is non-existent
