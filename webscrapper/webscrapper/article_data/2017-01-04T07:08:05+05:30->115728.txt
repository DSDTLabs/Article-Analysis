MUMBAI: Even as BMC elections are fast approaching, the bickering between partners Shiv Sena and BJP doesn't seem to end. The latest instalment is a poster war.

 A day after a poster taunting chief minister Devendra   was put outside the BMC from an anonymous group called `Mee Mumbaikar', the BJP put up a poster outside the   in Dadar replying to it.
 
 The BJP poster, signed by spokesperson Shweta Shalini, reads: “The era of politicizing over posters has gone. Now, the citizens of Mumbai only want development.“
 
 Chief minister   has time and again said they will focus on development as their main agen da for the BMC elections.
 
 The poster put up by Mee Mumbaikar seemed to chide Fadnavis for apparently saying: “A person from Nagpur will change Mumbai.“ It read: “A man from Nagpur should keep Nagpur together with Maharashtra. Only someone from Mumbai is capable of keeping Maharashtra unified along with Nagpur.“
 
 There is no clarity over who put up the poster on Monday but, in a sign of the deteriorating ties between the BJP and the Sena, the BJP feels that the posters were put up by Sena workers just before Fadnavis was supposed to come to the BMC headquarters for a function. Incidentally, Fadnavis and Sena chief Uddhav   came together at the BMC HQ to unveil a portrait of Thackeray's grandfather and social reformer Prabodhankar Thackeray.
 
 Both parties, allies in the state government as well as the BMC, have been locking horns all too frequently over many issues, one being that of a separate Vidarbha. The BJP is a known advocate of the idea, while the Sena is fiercely opposed to it. The differences between the parties have also led to long silences from their leaders over whether an alliance for the upcoming election is on the cards or not.
