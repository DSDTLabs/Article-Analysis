GURUDASPUR: The state government has asked the procurement agencies, officials of food and civil supplies department and state police to make extra efforts for smooth purchase of wheat, said   president   here on Friday.

 While speaking at a function, the   MP said the government would ensure the payment for the procured wheat in 24 hours as the   (RBI) had already sanctioned the cash credit limit of more than Rs 18,000 crore in advance.
 
 Talking about the loan waiver scheme of the Punjab government, Jakhar said the main aim was to provide the much-needed relief to the debt-ridden farming community of the state as the farm sector witnessed complete stagnation due to “anti-farmer policies of the NDA government”.

About the proposed new medical college at Gurdaspur, Jakhar said the institution would provide a big push to the development of the border belt.
