Chandigarh: The two women who have been made accused in the HCS (judicial) exam paper leak case, were average students, said a former teacher of the duo, in his statement before a court here on Wednesday.

 The teacher is the owner of an academy which trains candidates of competitive exams. Surinder Bhardwaj, owner of Jurist Academy in Sector 24, said the women, Sunita and Sushila, had enrolled for coaching at his institute to appear in Haryana Civil Services (judicial) exam, but had scored average in all the mock tests.
 
 He claimed that Sunita had been preparing for different competitive exams for many years, but she never got a government job. The petition, filed by one Suman, alleging a scam was taken up by the Punjab and Haryana high court on August 8 and adjourned to August 16, when the court issued notice to the high court administration on allegations. The same day registrar (vigilance) was entrusted with the probe by the high court administration. On August 28, the high court stayed the declaration of the exam result. It is to be recalled here that the complaint was made by petitioner Suman to high court in July. The examination for 109 HCS (judicial) posts was conducted on July 16. The examination was subsequently scrapped.
 
 Three persons — Balwinder Sharma, a former registrar at the Punjab and Haryana high court, and beneficiaries Sunita and Sushila — were booked by the police. A high court committee looking into the case had recommended scrapping of the examination after prima facie finding that some candidates had access to the question paper.
