NEW DELHI: A 54-year-old man was burnt to death when a fire broke out in his house in northeast Delhiâ€™s Brahmpuri onWednesday.

 His wife and two children sustained minor injuries. Police said the whole family was asleep when the incident happened because of which they got trapped inside the house and could not come out until fire tenders reached the spot. Police are suspecting that a short circuit caused the fire. 
 
 Fire officials said they came to know about the incident at 2.37am and two fire tenders were sent to the spot. However, they could not control the fire in the next one hour, after which another fire tender was pressed into action. The blaze could only be doused by 4am. 
 
 The fire broke out on the third floor of the building, but soon spread to the fourth floor where the family lived. Police said that on reaching the spot, they rushed the injured to a private hospital where   was declared dead. His wife, Jayshree (48), and his children, Pooja (16) and Himanshu (17), were injured. They were declared out of danger later in the day. 
 
 The family members told the police that they had gone to sleep around midnight and heard neighbours calling out their names around 2.30am. The smoke spread in the house in no time and they started choking. They said that they tried to open the main door but it was jammed. They soon started falling unconscious. 
 
 Locals said they tried helping the family by throwing water to douse the blaze, but all efforts went in vain. It was only when the fire tenders reached the spot that they could be rescued. Police said a case has been registered and a probe has been started into the incident.
