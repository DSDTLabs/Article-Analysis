Vijay has been making quite a few road trips of late and his travel buddy is his mother. “I have always loved travelling and whenever I get time off from work, I hit the road. Usually it’s within Karnataka because I believe that our state has some of the most scenic places in the country,” he says.

Recently, it was Tanjavur that beckoned them. “Mum wanted to visit the Brihadeshwara temple. It is more than 1800 years old and we were blown away by the architecture. The ceilings also have paintings and they look so fresh even today,” observes Vijay. Up next the mother and son want to travel to   and  . “Hopefully, it shall happen soon,” he wraps up.
