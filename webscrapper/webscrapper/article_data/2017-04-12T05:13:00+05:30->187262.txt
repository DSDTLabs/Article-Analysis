Ghaziabad:   by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) in four public parks in the city, might cease to be free for users by the end of this month. The   is working on a plan to handover maintenance of these gyms to private firms through contracts.

 The GDA has invited expressions of interest this week, for the maintenance of the gyms located in Swarnajayanti Park of Indirapuram, Central Park of Raj Nagar, Lohia Park of Rajendra Nagar and Ambedkar Park near Vaishali metro station. These gyms have been installed with state-of-the-art workout equipment that is placed inside wire-mesh enclosures.
 
 “The GDA does not look forward to earning revenue from these gyms. However, there are operational issues like regular cleaning of equipment as well as timely entry and exit inside the enclosures. Security of the equipment installed is also a matter of concern. The horticulture department does not have the expertise to look into all these issues,” chief horticulture officer, SP Shishodia told TOI.
 
 According to the GDA, a set of terms and conditions will be issued upon the contractors that would include cleaning of equipment apart from maintaining a register to record entry and exit of visitors. Officials said they have been receiving complaints from residents that the gyms under the care of the horticulture department, remained inaccessible during early mornings and after sunset, when people generally go for a workout. GDA is likely to hand over contracts of these parks to four different agencies, for a period of one year each.
 
 Maintenance of two other open-air gyms located in Green Park along NH-24 and inside Nehru Stadium, was already handed over to private firms in December last year. The maintenance firms have been charging from users a fee of Rs 10 per hour or a monthly fee of Rs 150 to access these gyms.
