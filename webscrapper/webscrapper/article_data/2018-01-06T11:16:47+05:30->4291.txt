CHANDIGARH: Debris happens to cover almost half of a big, empty plot near the Sector 32-33 roundabout here. 

 The Sector 33B ground, which is not of much use to residents living nearby, has debris scattered all over it in large heaps. This debris is dangerous too, as it comprises concrete, stones, bricks sand, and even shards of glass and other, potentially injury-causing substances. 
 
 A walk in the area reveals a long list of disposables scattered all over the vacant land, which has thick shrub growth. The garbage contains packets of cigarettes, food packets, plastic waste, dry leaves, and paper littered by smallscale vendors that line the pavement near the roundabout. 
 
 May people working in Sector 32 converge to these makeshift, street-side shops in   for lunch, and dump the disposable plates that come with the food in the open piece of land. “We try and clean our own waste from the area. We are not responsible for this,” said a food vendor, who did not wish to be name. 
 
 Domestic waste and garbage from nearby sectors, including kitchen waste, vegetable residue, peels, and onion skins can also be seen in the area. The plot has an undulating appearance, with thick undergrowth stemming out in large clusters all around.  , and other types of furniture waste have also been dumped in the plot by carpenters unwilling to locate a suitable dumping area nearby.
