 “Thanks to a complete lack of planning by the developer and the authorities, there was no dedicated playing area in the whole of Palam Vihar,” said Sunil Yadav, RWA president, Palam Vihar. 
 
 He added the parks in the colony could not be used by kids for outdoor activities as residents use them for morning walks and other leisure activities. “There was no place for the kids to play without the fear of getting snubbed by residents, so we developed a dedicated area with a  ,   and cricket pitches,” said Yadav.
 
 The land where the sports centre has been built was earlier filled with garbage, and had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, said Ved Prakash Sarin, an RWA member.
 
 The association members pointed out they could not identify the land owner despite all attempts. They decided to place a board outside the centre. “We have only converted a dump yard into a play area. As soon as someone claims ownership of the land, we will clear it, and relocate the sports centre,” Yadav asserted. 
 
 The association is also in talks with some coaches for training the youth in the locality. A cricket coach has already been appointed. 
 
 Residents have welcomed the RWA’s initiative. “In concrete jungles like  , kids nowadays do not have access to playing outdoors, as there no spaces for them to play. This initiative gives the kids freedom to play without us worrying about their safety,” said Anil Yadav, a resident and father of two.
