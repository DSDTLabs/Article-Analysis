Panaji: One of the first complainants in the Sydney Lemos fraud case told STOI, Ryan de Souza, the 25-year-old senior accounts specialist, should have been responsible and aware of what he was doing. M Al Mashjari said when they visited the Exential office in March 2016 to get their money as promised by Lemos, it was Ryan who took them into a conference room and tried to pacify about 100 investors who had gathered there. “We were taken into a conference room where Ryan de Souza gave us a fake telegraphic transfer note with the signature of Sydney Lemos, and the company stamp and bank stamp, to calm us down,” Mashjari said. He said they left soon after they got the transfer note, expecting the money to be deposited in their accounts within 24 hours. “But it never happened. We approached the bank and found that the transfer note was fake. It was taken from an old telegraphic transfer note,” Mashjari said. He said if Ryan was innocent and the firm was pushing him to do “something illegal”, he should have “stopped, resigned and told the authorities about it”. “He knew what was happening. He was handling accounts, even if it was for a few months,” Mashjari said. Ryan’s father Martires de Souza, had told TOI last Tuesday that his son was innocent. “He has been made a scapegoat. He only worked in accounts for four months before the company was sealed,” he had said. The chorus for Ryan’s innocence is growing in the state, with south Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar being the latest to join the bandwagon by tweeting his support. “Today father of #RyanDsouza with #DayanandMandrekar & Ors. called on at my Margao Office. Discussed the issue. Assured to take the same to #EAM Smt. @SushmaSwaraj ji. #JusticeforRyanDSouza,” he tweeted on Saturday.
