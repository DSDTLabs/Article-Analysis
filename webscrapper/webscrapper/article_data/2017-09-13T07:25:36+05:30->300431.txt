UDAIPUR: In a shocking incident, a fourth semester student of a private engineering college here killed himself by jumping into a lake hardly within an hour after he had stabbed the college director on Tuesday.

 Twenty-three-year-old   Jain, son of Mahendra Jain and a resident of Phalasia in Jhadol block of Udaipur, jumped into Lake   on Tuesday afternoon, presumably out of guilt and fear for having committed a crime. “Raj Shekhar Vyas (60), the director, has sustained injuries on his neck and abdomen. His condition is now stable,” DySP Bhagwat Singh Hingad said. 
 
 The student was under depression for having to clear a few papers of the past semesters, sources said.
 
 “The incident took place at Techno   under Hiran Magri police station area in the afternoon. There was some placement interview going on at the campus, however, Bhavik was not allowed to participate as he had to clear six papers of the previous semesters and, hence, was ineligible as per the college norms,” Hingad said. 
 
 The student was reportedly upset and barged into the director’s chamber. He had a heated argument first and then laid a sudden attack and stabbed the director in his neck. The director tried to save himself but sustained a second stab wound in his abdomen. Bhavik immediately fled from the scene. Meanwhile, police rushed Vyas to hospital and launched a manhunt for the accused. However, within some minutes, people spotted a body in Lake Pichhola and informed the police. Ambamata police rushed to the spot and pulled out the body that was identified to be of the student. “Bhavik lived in a rented room near the college. His parents have been informed. The autopsy would be conducted on Wednesday,” the DySP said.
