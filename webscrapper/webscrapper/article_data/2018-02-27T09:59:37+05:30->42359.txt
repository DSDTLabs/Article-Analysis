CHANDIGARH: A district court has ordered status quo in the case related to the eviction of Chandigarh Horse   Society from its training ground in Sector 1. The society had challenged the eviction orders that had come from the subdivisional magistrate (east) and   director sport and sports council secretary. 

 The society submitted that it had trained 1,450-odd children and won numerous competitions. It also claims to be breeding 25 horses at the facility. Its application filed on February 5 states that an order was passed to evict it from the property. On June 2004, the administration had given it the site for promoting equestrian sport and fixed Rs 1,500 as monthly lease, which was paid regularly till September 2017, after which the sports council refused to accept it, says the application.
 
 In December 2005, the administration proposed to shift the club to a site developed specifically for the purpose, since the present space was a camping site for tourists. The application states that till the time the new premises was not ready, the club was to continue putting up in Sector 1, subject to payment of the rent. The lease, however, was not renewed after 2007.
 
 The riding society claims to have given the administration all details of its requirements, when asked. It says that Chandigarh's laws do not allow keeping horses in residential areas, and if the horses do not get adequate and appropriate shelter, they can die. The club accepts being in unauthorised possession of the land since 2007 after the lease was not renewed. However, it has asked why no action was taken against it for a decade. The court has ordered status quo until the appeal is decided.
 
 Founded in 2003, Chandigarh   is located at the Sports Complex adjacent to the   in the city.
