AHMEDABAD:   from Surat failed miserably in his bid to ‘rediscover’ himself by growing new hair on his  . He sued the clinic for the failed   and the side effects caused by the medicines he took.

  In a recent order, the  , Surat directed Discover Clinic Pvt Ltd to return the money they charged Shah with interest. The court asked the clinic, its head and the doctor who treated Shah to refund Rs 75,000 with 8% interest besides paying him Rs 2,000 as compensation for physical and mental torture and Rs 2,000 towards the expenditure that Shah incurred on the court case.
 
 In Shah’s case, representatives of Rediscover Clinic approached him in April 2014. He visited the clinic and chose a treatment for body hair removal and weight loss for Rs 25,000. He also agreed for a hair cultivation treatment and paid Rs 50,000 extra for it.
 
 Shah told the court that in six sittings and he was given platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy. The doctor also prescribed him medicines and he spent extra money on them. However, he did not find the treatment to have any beneficial effects and the medicine caused side effects. He complained about this to the clinic, but the staff behaved rudely with him.
 
 Shah approached the consumer court and showed the evidence of the various amounts paid to the clinic. The court sought the clinic’s reply, but no one came to dispute Shah’s case. The court finally passed an ex-parte order for refund of the money within one month.
 
 In the past, a consumer court had ordered an ayurvedic dispensary to refund payments and pay compensation to Hemant Patel from Navsari, who was promised an increase in his sperm count and mobility with a year-long treatment.
 
 In yet another weird deal, a consumer court directed a city-based vastu consultancy firm to refund one Ramesh Solanki and fined the firm Rs 10,000 for prescribing rituals which failed to solve Solanki’s domestic problems.
