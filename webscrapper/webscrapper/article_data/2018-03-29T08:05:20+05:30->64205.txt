GURUGRAM: Gurugram became the most polluted city in Delhi and NCR on Wednesday as the PM2.5 concentration spiked to 200 per cent within 48 hours. The highest level of PM2.5 was 63 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday but it increased to 216 (over three times higher than safe limits) on Wednesday. The PM2.5 concentration was below 70 ever since last Friday (March 23). 

 On Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) in Gurugram was 366, considered ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, Delhi and Faridabad reported ‘poor’   at 257 and 232, respectively., while Noida and Ghaziabad reported ‘very poor’ AQI at 340 and 360, respectively.
 
 Experts blamed the start of the stubble burning season in Punjab and Haryana for the rise in PM2.5 levels. “Every year, after spring, massive farm fires lead to a rise in the level of particulate matter in the air. Poisonous gases, including carbon dioxide, are also added to the air. So now, we will see cities like Ghaziabad and Gurugram getting more polluted than Delhi. However, the national capital will also bear the brunt of this,” said Debjani Ghosh, an environmentalist.
 
 Haryana State Pollution Control Board officials blamed the increase in PM2.5 on change in wind direction. “The winds are now blowing from Delhi and other parts of NCR towards Gurugram. That is why the concentration of PM2.5 has increased. But as per the Met department, the wind direction will change soon and the maximum temperature will rise, which will bring down the PM2.5 concentration.”
