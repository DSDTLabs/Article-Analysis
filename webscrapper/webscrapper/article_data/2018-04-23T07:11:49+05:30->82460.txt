MHOW: The   of four-month-old baby in Rajwada area was heinous. And if such incidents lead to doubt on relations with our neighbours or distant family members, it will spoil it for sure," said Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan at railway station on Sunday. 

 While commenting on the incident, Mahajan said, "It was a horrifying incident. With increase in number of such crimes people have started to lose trust on their neighbours and relatives. "I'm hurt because of this heinous incident. I think, we need to do a lot about such crimes from social point of view. We need to think, as it will break the trust between family and relatives especially about leaving our children in company of neighbours or relatives. These incidents would destroy trust of human on humanity."
 
 Mahajan flagged off Bhind-Ratlam Express, which has been extended till Ratlam, (21126) at Indore railway station.
 
 The railways has extended two pair of trains, Indore-Bhind-Indore Express (21125/21126) and Indore-Gwalior-Indore (11125/11126), till Ratlam. The trains will now originate and terminate at Ratlam. 
 
 "Extension of Indore-Bhind and Indore-Gwalior trains till Ratlam was one of the demands of   from Indore and nearby regions. Efforts are being made to fulfil even smallest demands of people and public representatives," said Mahajan at the inaugural function.
