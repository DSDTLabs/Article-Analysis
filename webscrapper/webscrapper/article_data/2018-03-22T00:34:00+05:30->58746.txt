An hour after BJP district president CR Nandakumar’s SUV was set on fire at Balan Nagar in Peelamedu, a businessman’s SUV and two-wheeler were set on fire at Selvapuram on Wednesday. Police suspect that the attack was aimed at BJP’s district trade union president Subbu, who stayed right next to the businessman’s house. Police said the businessman, Umapathi, had parked his SUV and scooter on the porch of his house at Indira Nagar in Selvapuram. Miscreants poured petrol on the rear side of the SUV and the scooter before setting them on fire at 3.45am. Umapathi and family doused the fire with the help of neighbours and fire and rescue services personnel. Umapathi told Selvapuram police that two youths had picked up a quarrel with him two days ago when he advised them not to ride motorcycles in a rash and negligent manner. He suspected that the youths were behind the incident. Police also suspect that the attackers’ target was Umapathi’s neighbour Subbu. Senior police officers hinted that both the attacks could have been carried out by the same gang. Police commissioner K Periaiah said, “We suspect the car was set on fire due to prior enmity. We have formed three teams to nab the culprits.” “The time set on the CCTV camera system at Umapathi’s home was half hour behind and hence, the time stamp could be wrong. If we go by that, there would be a half-hour difference between both the attacks. Also, one CCTV footage near Selvapuram shows three men on a motorcycle. We suspect that they joined these two later,” said a police officer.
