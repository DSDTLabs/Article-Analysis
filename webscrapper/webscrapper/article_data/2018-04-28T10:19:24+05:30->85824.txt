PUNE: Belonging to a family of farmers from drought-hit   district in the   region,   has struggled a lot. His years of toil paid off on Friday when the Union Public Service Commission declared the Civil Services Exam 2017 results. He secured the 20th all India rank, probably the first position for Maharashtra.

 “I owe this success to patience and perseverance. This was my fourth attempt. Before this, I went up to the interview stage but never got through. This is a news to be happy,” said Badole.
 
 Badole studied in a Zilla Parishad school in primary classes, then at a Sainik school and later completed MBBS from J J Medical College, Mumbai. Talking about the problem of language as a barrier that students from regional schools face,   said, “Initially it was a problem. But then I realized that language doesn’t matter in UPSC. It is all about your knowledge and quality and how you put your thoughts across to the other person,” he said.
 
 Badole said, “I always wanted to be an IAS officer. After completing my MBBS, I started preparations. For this, I came to Pune and studied here. My parents are extremely happy today. I am the first IAS in my family and they have been getting congratulatory calls from everywhere,” added Badole, who has a younger brother pursuing engineering.
