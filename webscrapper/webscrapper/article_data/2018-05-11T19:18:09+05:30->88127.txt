 Ishtiyak, who hails from Panna (in MP), says that he loves coming to Jaipur as it reminds him of his own hometown. “Panna is a heritage city and has lot of character. And this is true of Jaipur too. Also both the cities are famous for their architecture. So it always reminds me of my hometown.”

Talking about his show, he said, “It’s not a regular comedy show but a satire on the current political scenario of our country.

The actor shared with us, “It’s an honour to share the screen with Amitabh Bachchan. Luckily, I have got a chance to work with him thrice. His dedication towards his craft is amazing and you get to learn a lot from him.”
