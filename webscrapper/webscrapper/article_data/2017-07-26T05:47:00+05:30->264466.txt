Nagpur: In some respite to Class III and IV employees of Central Board for Workers’ Education (CBWE), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) granted an interim stay to transfer the board’s head office to Delhi.

 The division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Rohit Deo also issued notices to respondents, including Union labour ministry, CBWE and its director on the plea. A similar PIL filed by Tukaram Dekate was rejected last year.
 
 The new plea questioned the logic in shifting the board’s headquarters, as it was functioning from here since 1958. They contended that the existing facilities in the city would remain unutilized and the decision to shift was taken to please a few individuals.
 
 Currently, the organization has 50 regional and nine sub-regional offices.
 
 The proposal to shift CBFE headquarters was introduced by chairman K Laxman Reddy stating that most of its members were based in the capital and they need to travel all the way to Nagpur for meetings.
 
 The petitioners contended that the chairman’s reasoning is not true since Nagpur is well connected with all parts of the country. Citing an audit report, they argued that shifting of headquarters would be a costly affair and lead to unnecessary expenditure.
