MARGAO: With the monsoons fast approaching, residents of the low-lying areas of Margao’s Fatorda, Maddel and Mungul wards are worried about rainwater inundating their houses. The residents, along with those of surrounding villages of Seraulim and Benaulim staged a unique protest at the entrance of   town on Friday morning.

 Calling themselves the ‘Concerned citizens of Maddel, Mungul, Seraulim, Benaulim and Fatorda prone to floods’, the protesters gathered at the parking lot opposite the St Francis Xavier Chapel, near the KTC bus stand with a symbolic relief  . Calling it the ‘Margao floods relief boat 2018’ they said the boat had been built “to escape the perennial   that their low-lying areas experience during the monsoons”. 
 
 Firmly opposing the filling up of agricultural land, the protesters also submitted a memorandum of their demands to town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai and South Goa Collector Anjali Sehrawat. They have also demanded a 3.5km flyover from Nuvem to Benaulim that was initially promised to them by the PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar who they said was now denying the same.
 
 The group’s convenor, Benjamin Fernandes, told TOI that through this novel protest they sought to inform Sehrawat of the impending disaster that awaited them in the monsoons wherein boats would be the only viable form of transport.
