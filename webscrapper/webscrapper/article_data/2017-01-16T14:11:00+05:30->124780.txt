The show’s leading lady has been researching the perfect bridal make-up techniques and arrived at some truly incredible must-dos for every bride’s big day 
Here are some tips that Sangeita has shared on how a bride can look picture perfect on her special day:
 
 Ensure you clean your face and apply moisturiser before you start with your make up.
 
 Consider the climate before you apply your make up. India usually has hot and humid weather, so ensure your make up isn’t too heavy, else it could appear cakey.
 
 Primer is every girl’s best friend because it helps the make-up appear smoother.
 
 Use your concealer to hide your blemishes and spots for a flawless skin tone.
 
 Aside from the usual blush and eyeliner, keep an eyebrow pencil handy; it clearly defines your eyebrows.
 
 Your lip colour should always be in keeping with your skin tone.
 
 Do not go heavy on your make-up because you could look overdressed.
 
 Always carry a few simple make-up products with you so that you can touch-up and be ready for pictures in a flash.
 
 Add a touch of your own style and personality to your look.
