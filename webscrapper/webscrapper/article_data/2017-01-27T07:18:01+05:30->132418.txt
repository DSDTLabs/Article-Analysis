 Officials of the   (IMD), Hyderabad, said the city is expected to receive more such isolated spells of rain over the next 24 hours.

Ac cording to him, the intensity of the rainfall on Friday is likely be higher along coastal AP belt.
 
 Experts from the   (IITM), said it was extremely rare for a western disturbance (trough), to extend up to the city.“Usually a weather system that originates in the Arabian Sea, brings rain over the western coast. It is rare for it to extend up to Hyderabad which is land locked,“ explained A K Kamra, honorary scientist, IITM, though adding how rain-related extremities might increase in the city over the next few years.
 
 A study by the Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI), published last year, said the city observed 23 events with 20mm hour rainfall, which increased to 28 in 2005. By 2008, the figure had jumped to 36. Spells of even higher intensity i.e. 40 mm hour showed a similar pattern.According to EPTRI directorgeneral, B Kalyan Chakravarthy, Hyderabad had been witnessing erratic rainfall for 20 years. While experts insist that the projected rainfall for Hyderabad will remain largely unchanged for the 2020 to 2050 period -in comparison to previous decades -cases of “rain extremities“ (uneven rainfall) might increase.
