NAVI MUMBAI: Year after year, monsoon and   have been a deadly combination. The story continues this year despite all the talks about rain preparedness. 

 Four days of incessant rain has exposed the work carried out on the highway that links the city to Navi Mumbai and Mumbai-Pune Expressway. The temporary work done to fill   using gravel and paver blocks has come undone, resulting in motorists having a tough time dodging the craters. 
 
 Though the PWD has taken up the task of continuously refilling the potholes on the highway whenever there is a dry spell, only one spell of rain is enough to wash out the fillings. PWD officials have already declared that the problem cannot be resolved during monsoon.
 
 The worst stretches are near   signal just after crossing the toll plaza, a vast stretch after climbing down Vashi flyover, and on the   flyover where Thane-Belapur Road meets the Sion-Panvel highway. Craters have also surfaced near Nerul and   flyovers. Last week, PWD officials levelled the potholes under the Kharghar flyover but four days of rain and the road is again pockmarked.
 
 PWD executive engineer (grade -1) of Turbhe Division, Manjusha Dhande, said, “As potholes will resurface due to rain, fixing them will be a continuous process as asphalting cannot be done during rains.”
 
 Kailas Nair, an advocate, said, “I do not prefer to drive along the highway to avoid damage to my vehicle due to the potholes.” Satish Jadhav, a Sanpada resident, said, “I am scared to ride a bike with my wife or daughter as the potholes are an open invitation to accidents.”
 
 PWD has tasked the Sion-Panvel Tollway Private Limited with the upkeep of the highway. TOI tried to contact its officials but they were unavailable.
