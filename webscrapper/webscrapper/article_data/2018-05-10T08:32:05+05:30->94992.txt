LUDHIANA: While students of private schools have been continually securing top positions in the   (PSEB) exams, government schools have consistently been performing poorly. Students of as many as 336 government schools appeared for the class X exam, out of which 79 have got a pass percentage bellow 50%. Moreover, in Government High School, Sangatpura, not even a single student has managed to clear the exam, securing the dubious distinction of zero pass percentage.

 A total of 42,107 students of all private, aided, associate, and government schools appeared for the class X exam in Ludhiana district, out of which only 28,327 students could pass, while 9,635 students got compartment, and 4,059 students have failed. This year, Ludhiana has secured the fourth position in the state, with a 67.27 pass percentage. Mansa is first in pass percentage with 73.76%, Muktsar Sahib second with 72.39%, and Hoshiarpur at third with 67.27%. However, the pass percentage of Ludhiana district has increased over the previous years. This year, the district achieved 67.27%, while it was 48.96% in 2017, 65.42% in 2016, and 62.80% in 2015.
 
 In Government High School, Sangatpura, as many as 13 students appeared for the class X exam, out of which three have failed and 10 have got compartment. The school stands last in the district with zero pass percentage. Following it, Government High School, Malah, has got 5.71 pass percentage, as out of their 35 students who appeared for the exam, 26 failed, 7 got compartment, and only 2 students passed.

Jasminder Singh, in-charge of Government High School, Sangatpura, said: “We do not have sufficient teachers to get a good result. The post of Maths teacher is vacant for the past 10 years, as the teacher is on medical leave. Besides, the posts of teachers for Hindi, Drawing, and Physical Education are also vacant. Further, in August 2017, the education department appointed our Science teacher as block mentor, but replaced her with no teacher. Moreover, the post of head teacher has been vacant for the past 12 years. Once in 2015, a head teacher came for two-and-a-half months, after which he retired.”
 
 He added: “Several times, we have written to the education department, but to no avail. Then, we approached an NRI in this village, who arranged a Maths and Science teacher for students in December last. But the exams were in March. In just a few months, they could not deliver the result.” Education minister   said: “The schools and teachers will have to give an explanation for such a poor result. I have called a meeting to discuss the issue.”
