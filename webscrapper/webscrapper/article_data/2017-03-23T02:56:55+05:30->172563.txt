Chuck Berry's final album will get a release June 16 through Dualtone Records and, as expected, will go by the title 'CHUCK'. The rock 'n' roll legend's posthumous set, his first new album since 1979's 'Rock It', will feature guest performances from the likes of   Jr,  , Nathaniel Rateliff, and the showman's grandson Charles Berry III and is comprised of 10 new recordings, eight of which were written by Berry.

 Ahead of its release, Dualtone shared the 'CHUCK' tracklist and the new single 'Big Boys', a raw blues-rock number with a 'Johnny B. Goode' - esque riff. 
 
 
  
 Other tracks on the album include 'Darlin', 'Jamaica Moon' and 'Lady B. Goode', a so-called 'spiritual sequel' to his iconic 'Johnny B. Goode' from 1958. 
 
 Berry, who died on March 18 at the age of 90, recorded and produced the new set in various studios around St. Louis with his longtime hometown backing group, including his children  . (guitar) and   (vocals, harmonica), plus Jimmy Marsala (Berry's bass player for 40 years), Robert Lohr (piano), and   (drums).
