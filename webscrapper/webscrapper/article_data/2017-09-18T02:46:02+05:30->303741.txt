NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court wants the Centre and other agencies to   a policy to curb the practice of  .

 Giving a time frame of three months, a bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice C Hari Shankar recently told authorities that a PIL seeking stringent norms to curb the practice of celebratory firing is certainly in public interest.
 
 “This is an important issue. The authorities should treat the petition as a representation and notify effective policy on it. The same should be done in three months,” observed the bench said and disposed of the PIL.
 
 Filed by the father of a girl who died in April 2016 as a result of celebratory firing that occurred during a marriage procession, the petitioner had contended before the high court that such firing at weddings and other functions is an “obnoxious practice” which “causes terror among the general public”.
 
 The petitioners, Shyam Sunder Kausal and NGO Fight for Human Rights had sought directions to the ministry of home affairs to “frame stringent policy/ rules/ guidelines to curb obnoxious practice of celebratory firing”.
 
 They had argued that the practice is not under check and consequently the numbers of deaths are increasing, adding that even “carrying of a gun in a marriage procession is illegal under the Arms Act, 1959 and Indian Penal Code, 1860.”
 
 The petition had further sought direction for the home ministry to devolve a robust mechanism to ensure these licences are not misused and cancel the licence of anyone who does.
 
 It had also sought direction to the ministry to “impose heavy fine on people who misused his licensed arms and pay compensation to the every injured person or anyone who dies because of the celebratory firing.”
