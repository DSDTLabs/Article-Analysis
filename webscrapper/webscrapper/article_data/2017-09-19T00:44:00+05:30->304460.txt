Trichy: “We have 10 to 12 sleeper cells in EPS camp and they have conveyed that they are ready for the floor test”, said AIADMK (Amma faction) deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran. This apart, many MLAs with the rival camp had contacted him all along the way to Trichy from Chennai and told him that they would show their loyalty when the battle happened on the floor, he further stated. 

 On the eve of a public meeting convened by Dhinakaran faction against NEET, he arrived here a day before on Monday and addressed the reporters. While replying to the queries about the magic number of 117 to win the floor test, he said, “We not only have the support of 18, but also has 10 to 12 sleeper cells apart from the other three (mentioning about three independent MLAs who contested and won with two leaves). Besides, many have assured their support when it comes on the floor”, he stated.
 
 He also alleged the assembly speaker P Dhanapal left the 11 MLAs headed by O Pannerselvam faction without taking any action when they voted against the AIADMK government headed by Edappadi Palaniswami. However, now he had disqualified 18 MLAs just for demanding to remove him alone, he said and adding that he never expected that from him (speaker Dhanapal).
 
 “This kind of murdering of democracy would not have taken place in Tamil Nadu had the Governor safeguarded the dignity of his chair. He failed to do so. However we will win the legal battle soon”, Dhinakaran said.
 
 When asked whether the ruling BJP-led Union government had a hand in all these happening, Dhinakaran said if they would remain mute spectator by witnessing this murder of democracy, the entire people in the country would teach them a lesson.
 
 He also extended his thanks to all those people who were wishing to safeguard democracy by lending their voice against the assembly speaker.
