AMRITSAR: Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) NRI supporters have taken on   chief   for calling them outsiders, saying that they had a “Constitutional right“ to campaign in the state for the February 4 assembly elections.
Founders of AAP's 'Chalo Punjab' campaign in Canada, Joban Randhawa, Surinder Mavi and  , accompanied by a large number of NRIs, condemned Amarinder on Monday for “demanding to throw them out of Punjab“ while declaring that they had a Constitutional right to campaign in the state. “We are not bothered what Amarinder says, even if we are jailed for supporting AAP ,“ they said.
 
 They claimed that Amarinder had no right to complain to the EC against them.
 
 Joban, youth convener of AAP in Toronto, claimed that more than 35,000 NRIs would be campaigning in Punjab. He said Amarinder was frustrated after NRIs refused to support Congress. “ Amarinder had visited US and Canada to garner support of the NRIs, but he was not allowed to enter Toronto and Vancouver,“ he said.
 
 Surinder Mavi, who is convener of AAP in Canada, said, “If Amarinder can invite NRIs, then what is the problem if they are supporting AAP?“ He said Amarinder and Badal family were together to defeat AAP .Mavi said AAP would win over 100 seats in Punjab.
 
 Jaskirat said a revolution was taking shape in Punjab against the “corrupt and inept regime“, and all NRIs had come to join that movement. She said most NRIs coming to Punjab were professionals and labelling them terrorists was an insult to them. She demanded an apology from Amarinder.She said people of Punjab craved for a change due to corruption and mafia rule.
