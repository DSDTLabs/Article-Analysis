NEW DELHI: Delhi University on Thursday finally approved Delhi government’s   of   for the governing bodies (GB) of 28 government-funded colleges. The university’s executive council (EC), in a meeting held between March 7 and 8, approved the names suggested by the government with a few exceptions, thus completing the truncated bodies.

 University officials said that they are now hopeful that this move will make way for the government to release the funds of the 12 fully-funded colleges. These colleges have been unable to go about their routine work due to fund crunch.
 
 The EC meeting, which started on March 7 and went on till Thursday morning, saw members discussing the list of names sent by the government and “approved 280 names for the GBs of these colleges, including the 140 names sent by the government. However, we withheld four names from the government list as they had some issues,” said EC member Rajesh Jha.
 
 Explaining that the names were withheld “on principle”, EC member AK Bhagi informed that a couple of them were of current   employees and said, “We cannot approve that.”
 
 EC has also asked the government to provide data of around 30 names that do not have proper details mentioned with them in the list. “There are no designations mentioned with these names or the address proofs. We have asked the government to provide that information soon,” Bhagi added.
 
 Jha, however, said that while the information with the names may not be complete, it is time that the matter gets resolved and that the government should release funds as “it is getting troublesome for colleges to pay teachers’ salaries and for their infrastructural maintenance.”
