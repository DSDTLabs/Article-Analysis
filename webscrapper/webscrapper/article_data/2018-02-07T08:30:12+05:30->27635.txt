HYDERABAD: Welcoming the idea to keep tracks clean with the help of bio toilets,   assigned to the upkeep of coaches want the positions of the bio digesters to be shifted.

 They rue that passengers in compartments equipped with these bio-digesters have to put up with the stench wafting out of these toilets.
 
  (SCR) has a total of 4,600 coaches, and currently, 2,000 coaches have been fitted with  . Sources said the cost of procuring a bio-toilet comes to Rs 1 lakh, while SCR spent Rs 4 lakh for fitting coaches with these toilets.
 
 Officials say implementation of the project is posing several challenges. “The toilets are getting clogged not only because passengers toss bottles, cigarette butts, gutka packets and sanitary napkins into them, but also mechanical fixtures like nonfunctioning valves are responsible. The water pressure available for flushing is not sufficient. Bio-digesters need five litres of water per flush”, an official said.
