THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Still smarting over the raw deal meted out to his loyalists in the reorganization of the district   committees, former chief minister   has decided not to attend the political affairs committee scheduled for Saturday. Instead, he wants the party high command to hold talks with him. 

 Though   (AICC) general secretary Mukul Wasnik who is in charge of Kerala had a discussion with Chandy, the former CM has stood firm on the demand that the party high command must give ear to his grievances. 
 
 "I have no complaint or any issues with the party high command. I have told everything when Mukul Wasnik came to meet me," said Chandy when asked about the differences with the AICC leadership. "I have made my opinion clear. There is no need to change my stand," he said on attending the PAC meeting.
 
 Chandy had earlier refused to attend the AICC convention in New Delhi, organised as part of the Congress campaign against the demonetisation drive. The state was represented by a bevy of leaders including KPCC president V M Sudheeran and opposition leader   at the meeting.
 
 Both Ramesh and Sudheeran have sought the high command's help to persuade Chandy as they fear that his stand will weaken the party in the state. Though Ramesh held talks with Chandy several times Chandy was firm that it is high time he reacted after he has been at the receiving end of the party high command. 
 
 During his discussion with Wasnik, Chandy had made it clear that the AICC should be ready for an organisational restructuring in the state and that an organisational poll was the only solution for it.
