AGRA: Repeated failure in elections and even loss of deposits have not deterred 61-year-old Hasanuram Ambedkari from trying his luck at the hustings again and again. On Thursday, he was busy completing formalities related to the nomination process at Agra collectorate. He has contested elections 83 times so far at various levels, from Lok Sabha, zila panchayat, gram panchayat to ward elections, without any success. This time, he will contest on two seats of Agra -Agra Rural and Kheragarh.

 The former   Employees Federation comrade has always contested election as an independent candidate.
 
 Ambedkari, who considers Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar his role model, said, “I will file nominations for contesting from Kheragarh, my home constituency, and  , where many of my well-wishers live. I have so far contested 83 elections for various posts. In the upcoming assembly elections, I will contest from two seats. I don't care who will be my opponents as I contest an election to give an option to voters who believe in the ideology of Ambedkar."
 
 For 32 years, Ambedkari has been contesting elections at various levels and posts.
 
 “So far, I have contested assembly election 24 times and of these, six times on Fatehpur Sikri seat, eight from Agra Rural and 10 times from Kheragarh. My best performance till date was in 1989 Lok Sabha elections when I secured 36,000 votes in Firozabad. In the 1985 assembly election, around 17,700 people of my home constituency voted for me. In 1988, my nomination for President was rejected. I look forward to filing my nomination again once President Pranab Mukherjee's tenure ends."
