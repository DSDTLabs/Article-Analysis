INDORE: Discom’s   — an all women zone – employees on Wednesday alleged mistreatment and sexual   by male members, who have been outsourced to meet the staff crunch. 

 The   came hardly two months after   introduced this zone on the International Women’s Day. The female staff has alleged that they experience an unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men at their zone office.
 
 The women have been employed by discom to operate its Aranya Nagar zone, which was projected to be run by all women staff. 
 
 “We are forced to work with male staff by our zone officials. While they had announced of making it a female zone, more than half of the staff who work here are men. They often misbehave and try to pass vulgar comments on us,” alleged one of the female employees while speaking to TOI. 
 
 She said that she along with four other girls working at the zone was forced to work with male staff. “They have been misbehaving with us and try to touch our body parts every now and then. They were not supposed to be here. It’s like we have been fooled by the discom and are stuck here,” she said. 
 
 They even alleged that the discom had announced to appoint a team of 25 female staff, but only 11 female staff is working on regular and outsourced terms. “While there are eight female linemen for field work, only five of us are forced to go on field with men,” she added. 
 
 Discom MD  , however, clarified saying that the zone was started with all female staff. “Some of the female staff, who was appointed through a private agency, left the work due to their personal issues because of which we had to appoint male staff to fulfill our daily work,” he said. 
 
 He refuted the allegation of sexual harassment and said that an internal inquiry would be conducted to ascertain if any male staff misbehaved or harassed them.
