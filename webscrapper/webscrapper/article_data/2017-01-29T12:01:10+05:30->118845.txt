Having been linked to co-stars like   and  , actor   say he has now become thick-skinned to such gossips. During the making of '  2', reports emerged of the growing fondness between Shraddha and Aditya. Even after the release of the film, the rumors continued.

  
  
 However, later gossip mills linked Aditya to his 'Fitoor' co-star Katrina Kaif. "Now I have been in the industry for quite sometime, I feel these things (referring to link ups) will be written about you all the time. I am thick-skinned to these things. Most things I don't read and whatever I read doesn't really affect me," Aditya said. 
 
 "I don't want to waste my time trying to control these things as my life will become a vicious circle," he said. Aditya, however, says that initially when he was linked to Shraddha, it used to bother him. "As far as rumors about us (Shraddha and me) are concerned, we know each other and between the two of us we know the truth. We don't bring it now, earlier we used to talk about it. You can't let it affect you so much." 
 
 The 31-year-old 'Dawaat-E-Ishq' actor thinks link-ups are part and parcel of the film industry. "It comes with the territory. I think most of the actors face this. They (actors) are linked with every co-star they work with." The VJ turned-actor is now looking forward to the release of 'Ok Jaanu', in which he is paired opposite Shraddha.
