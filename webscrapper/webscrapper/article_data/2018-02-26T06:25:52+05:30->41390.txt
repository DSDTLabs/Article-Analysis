HYDERABAD: A severe dearth of anatomy professors has resulted in a new crop of doctors passing out without proper knowledge of the subject- a basic for   and in the process, affecting the quality of the pass outs. There have been no professor for the subject in at least two medical colleges, namely   and Warangal Medical College- while others manage with minimal staff, sometimes even on part-time faculty.

 Anatomy is compulsory for completing MBBS. “However, MBBS students aren’t going through adequate lessons in the subject. At times there are 20 or more students being given practical lessons together which makes it difficult to understand the subject. Many don’t even get a chance to try their hands on the practical subject,” a source told TOI.
  
  
 Agreeing to the impact on quality, Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, president   (IMA)-Hyderabad unit explains, “Without knowing anatomy, no doctor can be a doctor. The shortage definitely affects the passouts who would not know the basics of the human body as they have not studied the subject thoroughly.”
 
 The shortage has left doctors wanting to pursue MD anatomy in the lurch, “ Kakatiya Medical College,   and   do not have professors in the subject for 7-8 years. There are MBBS pass outs who are waiting to join MD anatomy for two years or more but are unable to do so in the absence of assistance professors to teach them,” said Dr G Srinivas, advisor,   (TJUDA).
 
 “An MD anatomy can only join as a professor in a medical college unlike doctors in other specializations who can join corporate hospitals . This dearth of professors is bound to remain unless the government gives extra leverage to the subject,” added Dr Yadav.
