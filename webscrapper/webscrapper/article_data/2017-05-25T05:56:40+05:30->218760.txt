NEW DELHI:   (DPCC) has suspended 73 members for six years for defying the party’s orders and contesting the civic elections as independents. 

 Those who have faced action include four former councillors. Though dissidence had plagued all the three main parties during the municipal polls, Congress is the first among them to initiate tough measures against rebels.
 
 The decision was taken during a disciplinary committee meeting chaired by Narendra Nath on Wednesday. Other members of the committee include Mahmood Zia, Surender Kumar and Abha Choudhary.
 
 These candidates have been accused of indulging in anti-party activities because they contested against the official Congress candidates. “It was also decided that the husbands of those women, who stood as rebel candidates against the official candidates, should be suspended for six years from the party,” Nath said.
 
 “The sitting councillor of Nangli Sakrawati ward   was given party ticket from Chhawla ward but he fielded his wife against our candidate from Nangli ward,” Nath said. Similarly, former Kasturba Nagar ward councillor Ravi Kalshi who was denied ticket, had fielded his daughter-in-law against the official Congress candidate. Both were suspended from parties. The other two ex-councillors who faced disciplinary action are Ramesh Pandit from Ghondli and Dharmender Singh from Karawal Nagar West.
 
 Nath further said that other complaints would be scrutinised and proper action would be taken against those who try to indulge in anti-party activities.
 
 Congress came in third in the municipal polls. They won 31 out of 272 municipal wards across the three municipal corporations. Infighting in the party is said to be a major reason behind Congress’ defeat. Senior functionaries like A K Walia,   and Mangat Ram Singh openly expressed their disappointment with the ticket distribution process ahead of the polls.
 
 Former CM   had claimed that she was not invited to the election campaign.
