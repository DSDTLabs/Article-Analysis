CHENNAI: Noting that marks awarded to 36 in-service candidates under ‘personality, smartness, and performance’ category for appointment to posts of assistant engineers by   (CPT) were arbitrary, the Madras   quashed a 2009   list published by the port.

 Allowing a plea moved by an unsuccessful candidate, a division bench of Justice KK Sasidharan and Justice P Velmurugan directed the CPT to conduct fresh selection by adopting a fair and   process without any element of arbitrariness. It was made clear that the selection process should be confined to the 36 candidates who had taken part in the selection on February 21, 2009 and that it should be completed in three months.
 
 According to M Velmurugan, in 2009 the CPT invited applications for four posts of assistant engineers (civil) on redeployment basis. All the candidates secured equal marks under the categories ‘qualification’ and ‘experience’. The selection panel, unguided by any guideline, awarded marks under ‘personality, smartness and performance’ category, tilting the balance in favour of few and selected them.
