Margao: “From the time investigation in the matter has begun, I have always cooperated with the ACB (anti-corruption branch). Since 2013, the ACB has summoned me 25 times and I have appeared before them every single time,” state opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar said. He told TOI that the ACB had inspected his house, factory as also his properties in Kerala, in 2013-14. He added that he has submitted all documents asked for by the ACB in the disproportionate case against him. “I will continue to extend full cooperation to the investigation, as always. Even today (Saturday), when I learnt about the raid, I called my people to tell them to extend full cooperation to the raiding party. I abide by the law and let law takes its own course,” Kavlekar said from Dharwad, Karnataka.
