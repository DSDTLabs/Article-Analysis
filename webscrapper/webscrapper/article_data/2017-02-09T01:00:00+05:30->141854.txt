The film is a sequel to the National Award winning 'Jolly LLB' (2013) which used a high profile hit-and-run case as its reference. '  2'’s first few screenings have drawn positive responses. 

  
  
 Here’s what makes the film a must-hop-on-to ride this weekend with popcorns, samosas and chai for company…
 
 
 
 
 
  
 “Jolly LLB 2 is not only an entertainer, but it also coveys a relevant message. At the same time, working on this film was also a learning experience for me. It taught me a lot of things about the Indian judicial system that most of us are not aware of. I loved collaborating with Subhash Kapoor on this film. While we had tremendous fun making the movie — there was not a single day when we didn't laugh our heart out — I hope the audience has as much fun watching it.” 
 
 
 
 “Subhash has done complete justice to my character, Pushpa. She’s a lioness, not a pushover or someone standing on the sidelines. In fact, she’s the man in Jolly’s life. It'd be stupid to let a film like this go”
 
 
 
 “My work strings together a strong storyline, an ounce of entertainment, a generous serving of drama and a core thought. I agree with Akshay that the film is 35 per cent satire and the rest, an engrossing courtroom drama. He has worked extremely hard on this project”
 
 'Jolly LLB 2', produced by Fox Star Studios, releases tomorrow.
