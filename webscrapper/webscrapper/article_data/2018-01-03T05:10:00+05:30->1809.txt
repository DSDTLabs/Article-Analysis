Hubballi: The video of a traffic policeman thrashing a motorbike rider, who was allegedly in an inebriated state, at the KC Circle, has gone viral. The incident occurred on Monday afternoon.

 Sources said two people on their motorbike allegedly tried to ride into the one-way at Neeligin road from KC Circle, allegedly in a drunken state. The traffic policemen, who were regulating traffic at KC Circle, objected to it, and tried to impose a fine on them, in a drunken driving case. The accused got into an argument with the police, and refused to pay the fine and go with the police.
 
 “The accused allegedly hurled abuses at a policeman, when he asked them to visit a police station with him. Efforts by the police to convince them went in vain, as both the accused created a scene at KC Circle, and refused to board an autorickshaw. They even tried to assault an on duty policemen. Their rude behaviour finally forced the traffic police to thrash them in full public view, before taking them to the police station,” said Shripad Jalde, police inspector, East Traffic police station, Hubballi.
 
 “We really appreciate our police personnel, who showed courage and brought the accused to the police station, despite being threatened by them. The bike rider is Saikumar Bandhari, and his friend Amaresh of Hubballi city was riding pillion. They refused to go to the police station, and attempted to escape after abusing and assaulting the policemen. Left with no other options, the police personnel present at the spot thrashed the duo, and took them to the police station. A drunken driving case has been filed against Saikumar,” he added.
