We had earlier told you that the Sexy Durga actress   will be seen as writer   in Nanditha Das’ directorial Manto. Now, the actress is all set to essay the role of social reformer   in the Marathi movie titled  , directed by  . 

 Phule, who was one of the first-generation modern Indian feminists, was the forerunner in starting a school for women in the country.
 
 On the “big responsibility” she has taken up, Rajshri says, “It is a challenging task as the film has a lot of history. Savitribai is a complex character who is totally different from Ismath. I have to be extra careful while portraying both of their lives on screen as they have never been given a big screen depiction.” 
 
 Satyashodhak will have National Award-winning actor Sandeep Kulkarni playing Jyotirao Phule, Savitribai’s husband. “The couple had a very passionate relationship. At a time when people hardly identified the grievances of women in India, they stood up to fight the injustice against women,” she says. The film has gone on floors in Pune on May 21.
 
 The actress, who was also seen in Fahadh Faasil’s Haram, is also shooting for Manto. “We are on a break now as the movie’s trailer is unveiled at the ongoing Cannes Film Festival. Even, Sexy Durga is marking its presence in Cannes. So, I am excited,” says Rajshri.
