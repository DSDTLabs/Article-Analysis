VISAKHAPATNAM: Taking a stroll down the streets of   town or a closer look at the surroundings of   temple, one would hardly see any plastic lying around. 

 There are no water pouches, plastic spoons or covers littered in any part of the town thanks to a blanket ban imposed on selling or buying plastic by the municipal corporation five years ago.
 
 According to corporation employees, the ban is strictly imposed and shop keepers are fined heavily if found violating the norms. More importantly, the civic officials took it upon themselves the task of educating the public on the need to discard plastic. “Initially, there was resistance from vendors, shopkeepers and even the general public who were used to using plastic products from plates and glasses to water pouches. The open drains were choked with plastic waste and the hazardous material was openly burnt by the municipal employees. The municipal corporation did a commendable job in imposing the ban strictly for the benefit of the people,” said GV Rao, a retired tehsildar from Bobbili. “Today Bobbili may come across as a typically dusty town, with clean air. However, six years ago, the smell of burnt plastic was everywhere,” said P  , a civil engineer and contractor from Bobbili.
 
 “The credit fully goes to our municipal corporation, especially former civic chairman Venkata Shwetha Chalapathi Kumara Krishna Ranga Rao for his dynamic role in bringing about this change and former commissioner   as well,” Satyanarayana added. 
 
 However, despite the plastic ban, the town wears a shabby look because of the increasing number of dump yards. S Vara Prasad, a merchant dealing in fertilisers, noted that this was because of the increase in construction activity, infrastructure development and increasing number of industries. “Bobbili is still a very dusty town and not the clean and green town that it used to be 20 years ago.   has done some good, now we need to deal with increasing pollution.”
