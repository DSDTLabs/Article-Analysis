VADODARA: Months after Goods and Services Tax ( ) rollout,   and tax consultants across the country are facing problems with the new tax regime. 

 On March 7, members of different trade associations, tax bar associations and chartered accountant associations will make a joint representation before GST chief commissioners across the country urging immediate intervention or face agitation. 
 
 “Memorandums will be submitted in many cities of the country before GST chief commissioners seeking their intervention. If problems faced are not resolved, we will stage dharnas and intensify our stir,” said Ashish Shah, a city-based tax consultant addressing media persons on Saturday. Shah said small and medium enterprises are at the receiving end because the government has completely failed in ensuring that GST is rolled out smoothly. 
 
 “The government is claiming that those having turnover less than Rs20 lakh need not go for GST registration whereas the ground reality is that even the banks are not ready to open current accounts without GST registration. Similarly, goods of small traders are remaining unsold as nobody is ready to pick up goods without GST registration,” he said, adding that GST website itself is not functional since February 21. 
 
 “If the government has failed to put its house in order, why is it collecting penalty from traders for no fault of theirs?” he asked. While local GST offices are clueless, those deputed on GST helpdesk don’t entertain any query on the grounds that they have not received any training on this front, he added.
