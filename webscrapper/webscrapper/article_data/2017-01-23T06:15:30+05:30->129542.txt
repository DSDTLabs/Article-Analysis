KANNUR: The special vigilance team of the police, which probed a complaint filed by a parent against the judges and a dance trainer, found that judges and agent had accepted bribes. The team registered a case against three persons in connection with the case.

 A case was registered against judges Vedanthamouli and Vijay Shankar and Ansad, a dance teacher from Kozhikode. The complaint was lodged by the parent of a girl from Alappuzha who participated in the Kuchipudi event in the HS category.
 
 The parent alleged that the dance teacher had approached the participant as an agent. The complaint, submitted to the director of public instructions, said that the agent had threatened participants who were not ready to pay a bribe to get A grades. The DPI handed over the complaint to district police chief K P Philip for a detailed investigation by the vigilance team.
 
  said the police will review the results of Kuchipudi event (both HS and HSS category) as both events were reviewed by the judges who are facing corruption allegations.
 
 The DPI has also informed that some parents had informally complained about the same agent seeking bribes for the folk dance event on Saturday. But he said that the investigation regarding this is yet to begin as no formal complaint was received.
