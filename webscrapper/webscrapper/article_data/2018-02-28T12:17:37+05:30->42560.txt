We had told you that the Mozhi combo of   and director   will be coming back together again for the remake of Tumhari Sulu. Now, we hear that the film will go on floors in May and that the team has brought on board well-known cinematographer   and National Award-winning editor KL Praveen. 

 “I’m currently scripting the film. We are going to adapt the Hindi version and provide it with local flavour,” says director Radha Mohan. Explaining why he chose to remake this film, he says, “I found Tumhari Sulu an exciting watch, when I first saw it during its theatrical release. I loved the spirit of the film, the humour and its characters.” 
 
 He adds that Jyotika is very happy about working with him again. “We have been talking about doing a film together and when Dhananjayan approached us with this idea, it seemed just the right project,” he says. 
 
 Dhananjayan adds, "Unlike most remakes, where a producer buys the rights first and then puts together the team, here, we bought the rights only after we got Jyotika and Radha Mohan on board."
 
 Quiz him if he is concerned over the comparisons that would be made between   Balan’s and Jyotika’s performances, and he says, “Of course, there will be comparisons. But Jyotika is a terrific actress and she will interpret the character in her own way.”
 
 In a press statement, Jyotika said, “I am a big Vidya ( ) fan. I love her voice and command over Hindi, which is rare in Bollywood today. I’ve watched every Vidya film, and Tumhari Sulu, in my opinion, is her most lovable work. I feel honoured to be stepping into her shoes. Kudos to the producers and to   (Triveni) for making such a lively, honest, real and feel-good film.”
 Vidya Balan remarked, “As a Tamil ponnu, I feel happy about our film being remade in Tamil. Tumhari Sulu is a hugely special film for me and I wish Jyotika all the best in spreading the Sulu love.”
