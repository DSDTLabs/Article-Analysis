KOLKATA: The city is better equipped to combat waterlogging this monsoon, claimed mayor   speaking at a function on Friday.

 We are better prepared to handle waterlogging compared to Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi. We’re in the process of modernizing the city’s sewerage and drainage network to ensure minimal waterlogging,” said Chatterjee, after inaugurating a series of manhole desilting machines, which will be used to lift silt from manholes in narrow lanes.
 
 Chatterjee said the civic body will spend Rs 32 crore in revamping the sewerage network. “We’ll buy machines, pumps and employ manpower to ensure we don’t suffer from flooding of streets. Besides, we’re chasing a deadline to complete laying of sewer lines in non-sewer areas in Behala, off EM Bypass and north Kolkata,” he said.
