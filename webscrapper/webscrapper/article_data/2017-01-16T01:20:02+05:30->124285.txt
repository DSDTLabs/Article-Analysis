THANE: The city unit of NCP has levelled serious allegations over the functioning of   ( ) and has called for a state-level enquiry to be done by   in its operations.

 Taking a dig at the chief minister’s call for more transparency in functioning of local bodies, NCP has challenged him to initiate an investigation into the expenditure in the multi-crore spending under JNNURM. The party has also dared the ruling BJP to declare names of those found guilty of any misappropriation of funds in the findings.
 
 “The TMC received crores of funds from the Centre for initiating several infrastructure works in the city such as improvement of transportation, sewage disposal, and eradication of slums from the city over the last decade. However, there has been no visible improvement in any of these segments, raising questions over where has the money finally gone. The chief minister on Thursday said they wanted more transparency. So, we have thrown an open challenge to him to initiate an impartial enquiry into the same,” said city NCP chief,  .
 
 The NCP has also taken strong objections to the BJP blatantly displaying banners and flags at several parts of the city on Thursday despite the model code of conduct for the civic polls being in force since a day before. 
 
 The party has written to the state election commission driving their attention to this supposed flouting of the poll code by the ruling party. Hundreds of flags with BJP’s party symbol and name were being displayed along Eastern Express Highway and near the venue of the party’s state election committee meeting that saw attendance of the chief minister and other senior leaders. 
 
 Several banners with congratulatory messages and requests to fight the elections solo were put up at certain parts of the city. “This is clear violation of the code of conduct and we have written to the election commission urging them to take punitive action against the BJP,” said Paranjape.
