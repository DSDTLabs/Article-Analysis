NEW DELHI: A fact-finding team from Jharkhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights will visit Delhi to obtain more information about the brutal murder of 16-year-old Soni   in west Delhi’s Mianwali Nagar.

 
 JSCPCR chairperson Arti   said they have sought cooperation from Delhi Police to prepare their report about the incident. “We met senior officers who gave us details about the incident. It was also found that there were around eightnine children missing from the same village where Kumari belonged to,” Kujur said.
 
 The body has already asked local authorities in Jharkhand to provide protection to the girl’s family after it was found that the three accused –  , Sahu and   — were hiding in Jharkhand. Sources said that cops are in touch with their counterparts in Jharkhand to nab the accused.
 
 Rakesh had brought the girl to Delhi and sent her to a house in East of Kailash to work as a maid. Rakesh later took her to his house when she asked for her salary. On May 3, Sahu got drunk and murdered Kumari.
