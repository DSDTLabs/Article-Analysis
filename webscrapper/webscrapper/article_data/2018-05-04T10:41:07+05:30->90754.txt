CHENNAI: Two days after TOI reported about the   ( )'s failure to update the list of   which have been issued   on its portal, the planning authority uploaded an updated list on Thursday. 

 The CMDA's website updated the list of 64 constructions for which it issued planning permission between February 1 and April 30. 
 
 In the edition dated May 2, the TOI report said that the planning authority has for the past three months not updated the list of special buildings that have been issued planning permission. 
 
 This has left home buyers at the mercy of developers who, they fear, could saddle them with houses in  . 
 
 Though the CMDA portal made frequent updating on planning permission for other categories including layout approvals, the special building category remained blank for the three months. 
 
 Details of the planning permission granted for 21 special category buildings were updated only till January 30.
