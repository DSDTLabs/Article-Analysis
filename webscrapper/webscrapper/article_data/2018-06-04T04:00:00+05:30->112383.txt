Ahmedabad: The wife of Umar Saleh Mohammed Thaim — a Kutch sailor languishing in an Iran jail since 2014 — has written to Union minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala seeking his intervention to expedite Thaim’s release. Iranian authorities want Thaim to pay a penalty of Rs 58.78 lakh for his release. But his family says it is unable to pay such a huge amount as its sole earning member is in jail. Thaim’s wife Nurjan and his brother Noormohammed have sought Rupala’s help to have Thaim released in “the holy month of Ramzan”. Nurjan has also sent the minister the two letters she has received from the Iranian authorities demanding the penalty. “We cannot pay this heavy fine, so we request you and our government to please request the Iran government to show mercy and release him in this holy month and waive all the fine,” says the letter written by Nurjan to Rupala on June 1.  Thaim, 47, who belongs to Mandvi, was supposed to be released from the Minab prison during the ongoing month of Ramzan. But when his younger brother, Ibrahim, went to Iran to inquire about his release, he was told by the Iranian authorities to pay the penalty. The fine imposed by Iranian authorities originally amounted to Rs 97 lakh in Indian rupees, but considering his four years of labour in jail, and factoring some concessions, Iranian authorities may let him off with the reduced fine. Thaim was accused of smuggling diesel and of illegal intrusion by Iran. His boat was seized and he was jailed along with 11 other crew members in 2014. Thaim’s family, however, maintains that Thaim’s boat, ‘Safeena al Shena’ had strayed into Iranian waters due to strong winds and rough sea, while on its way from Dubai to Yemen.
