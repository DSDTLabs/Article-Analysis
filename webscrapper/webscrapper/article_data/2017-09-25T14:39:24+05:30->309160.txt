Kerala High Court, today, said that the anticipatory bail plea of actress Kavya Madhavan, wife of Dileep who is in remand in connection with the Malayalam actress abduction and assault case, need not to be considered as the prosecution have given the undertaking that she will not be arrested. 

 Her bail plea maintained that a section of the film industry, media and senior police officers were now bent on destroying Dileep's entire family. It stated, "Despite completely destroying the life and promising career of Dileep and that of his teenage daughter in the process, a group of unscrupulous senior police officers, a small-but-powerful section of the film industry and scores of obliging media personnel are trying to destroy Dileep's entire family by implicating Kavya in the case and arresting her." She also added that investigating officer Baiju Paulose and SP KS Sudarsan visited her brother's designer showroom and her parent's house in mufti. "They openly threatened that she would be made an accused unless certain illegal demands (they raised) were met," she said in her plea. Kavya stated that SIT was torturing, humiliating and harassing her in public by allowing Pulsar Suni to make pre-planned piecemeal disclosures to the media while being escorted to courts in pending cases.
 
 Meanwhile, the court has postponed the bail plea of director Nadirshah, a close friend of Dileep, who was summoned for questioning on September 17. He had pointed out in his plea that he is being intimidated from giving statements against the actor and the probe team is making attempts to name him as accused in the case.
