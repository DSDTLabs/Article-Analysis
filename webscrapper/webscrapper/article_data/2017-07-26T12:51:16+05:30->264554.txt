CHANDIGARH: Haryana Roadways transport employees’ unions on Tuesday held a protest for two hours in all 24 depots across the state against the issuance of more routes to private bus operators.

 “We carried out a peaceful protest in all depots from 9 am to 11 am without disrupting operations of buses. We also have plans to carry out a protest on August 13 at transport minister Krishan Lal Pawar’s camp office in his   village of   district,” said   president Dalbir Singh  .
 
 All the eight transport employees’ unions have wanted the state government to stick to its transport policy finalized in 1994 wherein a maximum of 923 private bus permits were issued on 452 routes.
 
 In the recent past, transport unions have held several meetings with the transport minister as well as other officers of the department.
 
 Kirmara said if the state government goes ahead with the issuance of more permits to private bus operators, it would result in creating their monopoly on routes. At the same time, this decision will reduce employment opportunities in the government sector, he added.
