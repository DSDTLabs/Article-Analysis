Nagpur: In view of the scorching summer, the Congress Nagar division of MSEDCL has decided not to undertake maintenance shutdowns in afternoons. From now on until the arrival of rains, shutdowns will be only undertaken in the morning before 11 am. An MSEDCL spokesperson said shutdowns were necessary for doing pre-monsoon maintenance works. “In addition, agencies like MahaMetro seek shutdowns for their major works. They can’t be avoided but can be rescheduled,” he added. The spokesperson said a number of complaints were received from consumers regarding lack of power supply during afternoon hours. “Taking cognizance of these complaints, we have decided to limit repair works to morning hours,” he said. However, the official said breakdowns during afternoon hours could not be avoided. “There is a huge load on the system during afternoon as people use air-conditioners and coolers in offices and homes. While our system has been augmented to meet this load, a few breakdowns can’t be avoided,” he added. In case of breakdowns, consumers should lodge complaints with MSEDCL toll free numbers 1912, 18002333435 and 18001023435. Meanwhile, MSEDCL has started SMS service in Marathi for its consumers.
