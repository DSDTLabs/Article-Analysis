LUCKNOW: In a decision that will affect around 1,000 aspirants,   has decided not to conduct MPhil admissions this session. Admissions will be held in the 2018-19 session instead.

 This means double the competition in the coming session. Every year, for around 270 MPhil seats, more than 1,000 candidates apply. In the coming session, while the number of seats will remain the same, candidates are likely to double as both 2017 and 2018 aspirants will compete.
 
 PhD and MPhil admissions were to begin in September last year. However, LU sent the ordinance which was passed by its executive council to the Governor on September 15. The Governor, also the chancellor of state universities, sent it back with several objections in October. LU sent the revised ordinance in November but is still to get an approval.
 
 “MPhil admissions couldn’t be held as the UGC has changed the admission policy. Soon, a new MPhil admission rule will be framed,” said LU spokesperson NK Pandey.
 
 Meanwhile, students didn’t agree with the university’s reason for delay, stating that if a new admission policy had to be made, why didn’t the university do so last year itself. “New admission policy for MPhil has still not been made. The changes should have been made last year,” said  , a student.
 
 “I have wasted a year as I didn’t enrol in other universities for the MPhil course,”said student Anita Sengar.
