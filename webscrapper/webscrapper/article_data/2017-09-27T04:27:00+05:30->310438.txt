NEW DELHI: Should information on child abuse cases be exempt from the right to information act? The national commission for protection of child rights (NCPCR) certainly seems to think so, refusing to divulge information to an   applicant seeking details of number of complaints received as well as cases pending for over two years by  .

 The   however, has come out strongly against the NCPCR decision, directing that information barring the name and personal details of children be provided within 15 days.
 
 RTI applicant Ajit Kumar Singh had asked for details of cases in the Bihar Circle, but was denied information by NCPCR under section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act 2005. The section exempts personal information from being provided under RTI unless it serves a larger public interest.
 
 Singh had sought information on the number of complaints received by NCPCR, a copy of inquiry proceedings in such complaints, date-wise decisions of cases where the accused were found guilty.
 
 “It is absolutely not convincing that NCPCR is refusing information about action taken on complaints pending since years before it,” information commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order. He also said that NCPCR used the privacy exception to refuse the entire information. No effort was made to provide information which could have been disclosed under a pro-active disclosure clause of the RTI Act, Section 4(1)(b), he added. The CIC issued show cause notices to NCPCR officials for not giving information on cases pending before it, without justification.
