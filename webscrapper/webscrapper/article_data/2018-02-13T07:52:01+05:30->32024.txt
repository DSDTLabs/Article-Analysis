LUCKNOW: The upcoming   is targeted at ending unemployment in the state.

 To provide employment to roughly 10 lakh youths each year, he said, the government will hold an Investors’ Summit each year and hope to attract investments worth Rs 1 lakh crore annually, said infrastructure and industrial development commissioner  .
 
 “Each year, 20 lakh youths enter the job market in UP. We are targeting employment for at least 5 lakh persons under the industrial promotion policy, 2017, and another 5 lakh under ‘One district, one product’. This summit is only a small segment of the government’s vision for employment and industry. While this summit is aimed largely at  , another summit in October will focus on global investments,” he said.
 
 Pandey said the government had identified various new sectors in which it could encourage investments. Among these were logistics and pharma. “UP is the main consumer of medicines in the country and it makes sense to set up pharmaceutical units in the state,” he said.
 
 The government is also targeting to be in the top 3 for states with ease of doing business. Officials said that UP was placed seventh at present but after implementing its various policies and launching single window clearance for industries on February 21, it was hoping to climb the tally by the end of the year. “To promote investments, four governance reforms have been implemented. These include improved law and order, power availability for which the state has entered into an agreement with the Centre to ensure 24x7 power for the state, ease of doing business and improved connectivity. By the end of this year, UP will also have nine more airports under regional connectivity, linking all major tourist and religious sectors,” said Pandey.
