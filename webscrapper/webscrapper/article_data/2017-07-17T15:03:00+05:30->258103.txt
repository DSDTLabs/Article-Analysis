PANAJI: Following the rescue of  , who was rescued from solitary confinement in inhuman condition in Candolim, NGO Bailancho Saad has demanded the state government to protect the rights of women.

 Sharing the experience of Verlekar’s rescue, the NGO’s convenor,  , said that she had been locked up in the room without any basic amenities. 
 
 “When we tried opening the door, the keys did not work. Verlekar was also reluctant to move out as she had been conditioned to behave so. She has now been admitted to a state-run Provedoria, which is doing the prescribed medical follow-up,” she said. 
 
 Martins also revealed that Verlekar is a beneficiary of the Deen Dayal   (DDSSY), but the money she had been receiving was being withdrawn from her account by someone. 
 
 “Sunita was receiving Rs 2000 per month from the welfare scheme into her bank account and the amount was being withdrawn. Whether she had assets to sustain herself is also being ascertained. The government should check whether the welfare money is being utilized suitably. Women who hold some share in property or money are often termed mentally unstable so that they can be deprived of their rights,” Martins said.
 
 The NGO has also demanded the setting of one-stop crisis centers for which funds have already been provided by the central government, as well as the setting up of a state resource center for women. 
 
 “The police should also not hesitate to register complaints made by women and investigate the matter. Many a times, they term it as a ‘family dispute’ and avoid investigation,” she said.
