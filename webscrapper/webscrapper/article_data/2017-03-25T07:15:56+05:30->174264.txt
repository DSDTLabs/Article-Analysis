NEW DELHI: The   dismissed on Friday former CBI director  's plea seeking recall of its order by which   was ordered against him for allegedly trying to protect some accused in the coal and 2G spectrum allocation scams.

 Taking a cue from the apex court's order in the controversial corporate diary case in which the court had refused to direct probe, the former CBI chief raised question as to how investigation could be ordered against him on the basis of entries in the visitors' diary at his residence.
 
 Appearing before a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur, Kurian Joseph and A K Sikri, senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the former director, said this diary could not be admissible evidence to order an inquiry . He also said that Sinha was not provided a report filed by the apex court-appointed committee on whose findings the probe was directed. “I should have been provided report filed by a committee headed by M L Sharma to defend myself but it was not provided and I was not heard before probe order was passed,“ he said.
 
 The bench, however, was not convinced with his submission and dismissed the plea to recall its order.
 
 The purported diary entries revealed that Sinha had private meetings with scam-tainted high profile accused at his official residence on many occasions.The diary was placed before the court by advocate Pras hant Bhushan and the court appointed a committee headed by former CBI Special Director M L Sharma to hold preliminary inquiry whether he had frequent meetings with accused.
 
 Sharma in his report said entries in the diary were genuine and the apex court thereafter ordered CBI probe against Sinha. It had directed CBI chief   to set up a Special Investigation Team(SIT), under his leadership and comprising two other officers of the agency , to hold inquiry against Sinha.
