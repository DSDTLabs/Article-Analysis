JALANDHAR: After   Gurjit Singh’s resignation has been accepted,   region has no representation in the   cabinet and lobbying has started among   MLAs. From four districts of the region Congress has 15 MLAs, including Rana.

 Barring three MLAs rest all are first timers. While   from Urmur is a third-time MLA, Pargat Singh from   Cantonment and Navtej Singh Cheema are MLAs for the second time. 
 
 Sources in Congress said that as lobbying for getting the cabinet berth has already started and the trio is already in the fray, but Congress MLAs from reserved seats are set to play Dalit card also. However, all the MLAs from reserved seats are first times in the assembly.
 
 In fact Jalandhar, which once remained a stronghold of Congress, missed the cabinet bus in February 2017 for the first time in 48 years after reorganization of Punjab as always the district had least at least one of its MLAs in the state cabinet even as it was a Congress government or SAD led coalition governments. In the past cabinets the district had more than one berths also.
 
 Even before the reorganization of Punjab in 1966 the district had representation in the state cabinet. After reorganization of Punjab, the late Manmohan Kalia (former   minister Manoranjan Kalia’s father) became minister in Justice Gurnam Singh’s government in 1969 and then in Parkash Singh Badal led government in 1970.
