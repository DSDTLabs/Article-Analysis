JAMSHEDPUR: The   of   and its surrounding towns were once a major attraction to the   during  . However, these areas are no longer preferred by the birds due to the   in the peripheries.

 The horde of all feathered birds which would arrive in large numbers to the noted aquatic sites, such as Jayanti Sarovar in Jubilee Park, Dimna lake which is located on the foothills of Dalma hills, Sitarampur dam and Chandil dam (in Seraikela Kharswan) and Subernarekha river, is diminishing with every passing year.
 
 “Rapid urbanisation has taken place in and around the city in the last four years which has negatively affected the flight route of these migratory birds,” zoology head of department of Cooperative College Jamshedpur K K Sharma and a member of the Ornithological Society of India, said.
 
 He added, “A variety of reasons like abrupt jump in high rise buildings, uprooting/felling of trees for construction work, increased boating in water bodies, installation of mobile towers in the periphery of water bodies and growing presence of the fishermen at water bodies which causes noise pollution are the reasons that have affected the flight pattern of the migratory birds.”
 
 Sharma said, “Even the composition of the water bodies are changing fast due to which availability of food of the migratory birds is shrinking.” He made it a point to mention that the construction of Marine Drive had already affected the arrival of the birds to Subernarekha and Kharkhai and the upcoming overbridge on Domuhani river will further affect the navigation of the migratory birds.
 
 “Vertical growth hemmed by high-rises and mushrooming of mobile phone towers has affected the navigation route of the migratory birds,” director of Tata Steel Zoological Park Bipul Chakravarty, said.
 
 He added that owing to climate change there’s a relative warmth in the atmosphere from where migratory birds normally travelled to, hence, there’s a change in the flight pattern.
