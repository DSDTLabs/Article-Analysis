PATNA:   and former health minister   once again stirred a controversy by saying on Friday that his party would build the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. However, when his statement went viral on social media sites, Tej tweeted that he was speaking about a ‘secular temple. 

 
 “What I had said at the Dangal programme at Bihar Sharif that the   has always talked about building Ram Mandir but it has never come up with a date. We will create a temple where people from all religions — Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christians — would pray together. It will be a temple for all mankind, and then the BJP will run out of the temple issue (sic),” he tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 Speaking at a wrestling event at Bihar Sharif on Friday, Tej had said, “Ram temple at Ayodhya will be built by the Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, the most backward people, the poor, and dalits. All these people will go to Ayodhya and build the Ram temple there brick by brick and the day we build the temple, the BJP-RSS combination will come to an end as they will run out of agenda.”
 
 Tej’s statement drew sharp criticism from the BJP. “RJD was an ally in the UPA government when Babri Masjid was demolished and they had unlawfully demolished BJP governments in four states — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan — in the aftermath of the incident. Now, Congress president Rahul Gandhi is wearing janeo, Mamata Banerjee is visiting temple and Lalu’s son is talking about making temple. It is all the effect of Narendra Modi,” BJP’s Darbhanga MLA Sanjay Saraogi said.
