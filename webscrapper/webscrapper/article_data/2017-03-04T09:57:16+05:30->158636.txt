INDORE: Even after four years of sanction of fund for construction of   at Indore  , the project has not been completed leaving passengers, especially elderly and handicapped in trouble. 

 Railway had sanctioned fund for the project in 2013. At present, after arrival of trains on main platforms, two over bridges get congested for at least half an hour and it makes very difficult for elderly people to come out. Boarding on train is also not an easy task since both elderly and handicapped have to take stairs, which are steep, in absence of escalators. 
 
 The authorities have started lift facility at the station; however, work for escalators has not seen any improvement after construction of base structure for an escalator to be developed at platform number 1. 
 
 According to earlier budget, Indore railway station was to get four escalators,   two and six others under Ratlam division of western railways one escalator each. 
 
 Earlier, Ratlam Rail Board had decided to build three lifts near foot-over-bridge. Two of them have started.
 
 Railways officials said that wheelchairs and stretchers are available for disabled and ill at the station. The escalator facility will start very soon. “The civil work has been completed for two of the escalators to be installed at Platform no.1 and 4. The agency is waiting for equipment of the escalators, which have to be imported,” said an official.
