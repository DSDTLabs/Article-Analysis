Panaji: The nephrology unit of the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), Bambolim will get a head of department (HoD) within a month, paving the way for resumption of   transplant surgeries at the state-run hospital.

 “Kidney transplants will resume at the GMC once senior nephrologist Dr J P Tiwari joins as HoD,” health minister Vishwajit Rane told TOI. Kidney transplants at the premier institute came to a halt after Dr Tiwari, who worked as a full-time nephrologist, went on a sabbatical. Dr Edwin Gomes, head of the medicine department, is currently holding charge of the nephrology department, too.
 
 A doctor at the GMC revealed that in the absence of a full-time nephrologist, transplant procedures could not be taken up even though the department receives three to four cases every month. The government had appointed nephrologist Dr Shital Lengade a few months ago. However, as there was ambiguity in his terms of appointment, the hospital decided to keep it in abeyance. 
 
 “Dr Lengade had assured us of his full cooperation in taking up transplant cases, but we decided to wait till his terms of appointment were made clear,” the doctor said.
 
 The health minister had told reporters last week that Dr Lengade would be issued a fresh appointment letter.
 
 The GMC is currently the only hospital in Goa to offer kidney transplant facilities.
