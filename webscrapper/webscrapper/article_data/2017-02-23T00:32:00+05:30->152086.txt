Pune: More men stepped out to vote in the recently-concluded corporation election on Tuesday, official data has revealed.

 Of the total 55.5% voter turnout, 52.7% was men voters, while the percentage of women voters was 47.29.
 
 The city’s electoral roll had 26.34 lakh voters, which included 13.57 lakh male and 12.76 lakh female voters. On Tuesday, about 6.91 lakh female and 7.7 lakh male voters turned up at polling stations to exercise their right.
 
 Officials, who were slightly disappointed, said that they had put in a lot of effort to increase the voting turnout. Some organizations had also announced special discounts and attractive freebies like ‘mehndi’ for females to encourage voting. 
 
 Dnyanada Nilekar, who got her finger inked on Tuesday, said she expected more women at polling stations. “Earlier, women used to refrain from voting or being part of politics as the field was largely dominated by men. But now the government encourages women to participate in the elections process. A 50% reservation has been given for women in local bodies. Women must use these opportunities,” Nilekar said. 
 
 Another voter, software professional Deepali Joshi, said women should vote to send a strong message to political parties, who ignore women’s demands. She added that most parties have not come out with any agenda to empower women or resolve their issues. 
 
 Meanwhile, the civic administration’s data shows that there might be a small reason to cheer. It shows that though fewer women voted when compared to men, of the total female population, over 50% cast their votes. 
 
 The data reveals that of the total female voter population of 12.76 lakh, about 6.19 lakh women exercised their right, taking the turnout to 54.17%. Among men, it was 56.75%, which means of 13.57 lakh male voters, 7.7 lakh cast votes.
