GAYA: In a bid to ensure peace during  ,   district administration has identified 2,000 suspected troublemakers and made them submit bonds of good conduct during the festivities.

 District magistrate   said all efforts are being made to maintain peace during the festival. “Besides taming potential trouble makers, procession licensees have been issued strict instructions to abide by the terms and conditions that have been laid down for the purpose,” he said.
 
 Procession organisers have been directed to get the music to be played during procession approved by police officials. “Unapproved cassettes and CDs will not be permitted,” said the DM. Altogether 289 licences have been issued to various groups for taking out Ram Navami processions.
 
 “Magistrates deputed on law and order duty have been directed to wear caps for easy identification. Senior magistrates will be deployed at sensitive points. While law enforcing officials have been warned against dereliction of duty,” added the district magistrate.
 
 At least twice in the past few years, magistrates were found absent from their places of deputation. More recently, in January, this year, about a dozen magistrates skipped law and order duty during the visit of Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama.
 
 Meanwhile, VHP leader   said there is lot of enthusiasm about Ram Navami celebrations this year. “The number of Ram Navami processions is likely to go up by about 20% this year. All efforts would be made to maintain peace,”   said and expressed reservations on the pre- authentication of music to be played during the processions.
 
 Activist Moti Bhai said Muslims would be welcoming the Ram Navami processions with beverages and flowers at different points including Nadiraganj and Chhatta Masjid.
