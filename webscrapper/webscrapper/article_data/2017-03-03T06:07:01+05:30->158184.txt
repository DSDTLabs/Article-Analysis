KOCHI: The   (SIT) probing the alleged   and   of a Malayalam film actor is mulling over submission of chargesheet without recovering the mobile phone of the accused in the case. As the efforts to recover the phone draw a blank, the cops are planning to record statements of more friends of prime accused   aka Sunil Kumar, to back the case.

 An accomplice of the accused revealed that he (Suni) had shown the video clips of the crime shot on his phone to his friends while on the run. According to police sources, cops are planning to approach the court seeking permission to record the friends’ statements under Section 164 of CrPC.
 
 “There is possibility of Suni showing the footage to Manu, a friend. Suni had reached Manu's house a few hours after the assault,” said a police officer. Manu is reportedly in police custody.
 
 As Charlie, Suni’s accomplice at Coimbatore, has told police that he did not watch the clips, police suspect that Suni had showed it to an unidentified person.
 
 Senior officers close to the SIT, meanwhile, claimed that they have got all necessary evidence in the case and will file a chargesheet within 90 days.
 
 Also, the SIT will have to rely on forensic report to push the case forward in court.
 
 According to legal experts, fluids collected from inside the vehicle and the clothes sent for forensic report would be crucial as the phone could not be recovered. 
 
 Police had earlier approached the court seeking permission for conducting a polygraph test, which the court is yet to consider. “The team decided to conduct the test on Suni following contradictions in his statements. Initially he had told the officers that the phone was thrown into a drain and later said into backwaters,” said an official. The survivor in her statement had mentioned about the accused video-recording her. Relevant sections under the IT Act were invoked by the police in the case. tnn
