AHMEDABAD:   has submitted an application of complaint with the city crime branch over suspected leak of question papers for   stream. Crime branch officials said they have opened the probe by writing to service providers for IP addresses of the cellphones on which the papers were found during a check during the exams.

 Gujarat University sources said that during a routine check during the exams at two colleges in the city they had found cellphones with some students.
 
 “On checking the cellphones we found question papers on a social messaging site installed in about 10 cell phones. We suspect that the question papers were leaked before the exam and hence to get it probed we have submitted an application with the cyber cell of the city crime branch,” said a Gujarat University official. Inspector of crime branch,  , said they suspect that question papers relating to other streams could also have been leaked. “We are probing the application submitted by the Gujarat University officials. We will only be able to confirm once we get the IP addresses from the service providers of the social messaging site to go the root of the leak,” said inspector Chavda.
