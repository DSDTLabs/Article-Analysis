GUWAHATI: The   in the state continued to show   on Saturday, even as   to lash several parts of the state and the weather department forecast   till August 2.

 According to the latest flood report issued by the   Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) on Saturday evening, the number of flood-hit districts has come down to six, with about 9,000 people still remaining affected. However, three more deaths were reported from flood-ravaged Morigaon district in central Assam, taking the death toll in the state to 82 in this year's floods. 
 
 As of Saturday, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar and Karimganj still remain under the deluge, with most of the 15 lakh people hit this year by one of the worst floods in recent history having returned to normal lives. ASDMA stated that there are 483 inmates at present across the 14 relief distribution camps at present, but unofficial sources indicate this number can be higher because floodwater has not receded in many parts of northern Assam because of incessant rain for the last 48 hours.
 
 Major rivers in the state are flowing below the danger level mark, but ASDMA officials said improvement in the flood situation will largely depend on the intensity of rains in the next couple of days. The Guwahati-based Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) of the IMD has predicted heavy rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura from July 30 to August 2. RMC also forecasts heavy rain at isolated places over   from July 31 to August 2 as a result of southwest monsoon activity.
 
 During the last 24 hours, light to moderate rainfall occurred at most places over Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura and at many places over Assam and Meghalaya, with isolated heavy rainfall over Arunachal, Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram.
