AHMEDABAD: A legal blunder by advocates representing the kin of those killed in the 2002   massacre has led the Gujarat high court to deny compensation to the victims of rape and sexual violence.

 The victims’ kin had sought reparations from the convicts to be paid to them and particularly to the survivors of brutal gender violence like rape, gang rape and other sexual offences with the contention that these are special offences that require special steps and protection.
 
 The HC rejected the demand on the ground that the compensation was sought for rape survivors under section 357 of the CrPC, which provides for the court to order convicts to compensate the victims. However, the court noticed that the victims’ kin had made such a demand for compensation in appeals, in which they had challenged the acquittal in this case by the SIT court.
 
 The high court said that it was not possible to order an acquitted person to pay compensation for victims of sexual violence. “Since an order of compensation can be made against the accused person who has been sentenced, the question of making any order for payment of compensation in case of accused who are acquitted would not arise,” the HC said.
 
 The HC further said that it has convicted three persons out of 29 who had been acquitted, but none of them were found indulging in sexual violence and hence the question of ordering them to pay compensation to victims of gender violence would not arise.
 
 Moreover, the HC also said that the victims’ lawyers did not point out the newly set national and international norms for reparations for victims of brutal sexual violence.
