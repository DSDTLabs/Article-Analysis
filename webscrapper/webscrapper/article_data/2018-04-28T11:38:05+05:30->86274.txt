LUCKNOW: Days after raising hackles of UP government by accusing it of being corrupt and failing on law and order front, cabinet minister and   (SBSP) chief   on Friday upped the ante once again by saying that BJP has not done enough in UP to get good number of seats in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 
 “People voted for BJP in general and PM   in particular, in 2014 after getting frustrated with   rule. The BJP, especially in UP, needs to assess its performance before going to polls next year,” Rajbhar said. Claiming that anti-incumbency was setting in against state government, Rajbhar said that party’s image was getting tarnished because of the inefficiency of officials.
 
 “Ek saal mein jitna karna chaahiye tha, hum log wo nahi kar paye (We have not done all that we should have),” he said. “Even CM Yogi is admitting this publicly in his recent public meetings,” said Rajbhar while adding that one year was not enough to judge the performance of any government. “At least, 10 years should be given to any party to perform,” he added.
 
 “It is high time for the government to work on its promise of providing quota within quota for backward caste,” said Rajbhar who recently submitted a proposal to CM for increasing OBC quota from 27% to 28%, and dividing it further to 7% for OBCs, 8% for Most Backward Caste (MBC) and 13% for most backward among MBCs. “I hope my proposal is taken forward,” he said.
 
 SBSP had embarrassed BJP after its two MLAs voted for SP-backed BSP nominee in   elections last month. This was after Rajbhar had threatened to abstain from voting but had fallen in line after meeting BJP president Amit Shah.
