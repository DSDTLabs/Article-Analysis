Actor   says his biggest regret in life is not starring in a film alongside his close friend   who died in January at the age of 77. McShane and Hurt were friends ever since they studied at RADA (The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London together.

  
  
 "Johnny Hurt died before we got to make another film together. Johnny was two terms ahead of me (at RADA) and then he left and I got the lead in a movie he was already in. He suggested it for me. Then we did our first play together and we shared a flat. It's funny thinking of him as gone. We're the last of the breed, us lot."
 
 "You know you move from TV, you go to theatre, you do film - that's what you were brought up to do. Proper acting. That's what you enjoy doing. That's what he did," McShane says. 
 
 McShane also has an ambition to work with acclaimed English director  , whose last movie 'I, Daniel Blake' was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.
