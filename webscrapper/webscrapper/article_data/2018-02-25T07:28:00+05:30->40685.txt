Ludhiana: The residents of Ludhiana turned up enthusiastically to exercise their franchise during the MC polls on Saturday. The rainfall did act as a spoilsport in the initial phase of the voting process, but as the day progressed and the sun shone bright in the afternoon, senior citizens, the newly-married couple, first-time voters and college-goers, thronged the polling stations.

 Aditya Gautam, a college student who is a first-time voter, was excited to exercise his franchise. “It’s a great experience to cast vote for the first time. The winning councillors should remember his/her pre-poll promise and always work for the betterment of their respective wards and society,” said Aditya.
 
 A newly-married couple, who came all decked up to the polling booth, said, “It’s the duty of every citizen to cast their vote. This is the only way through which we can choose the right leader for the society.”
 
 Another woman, who was present at the polling station with her husband, echoed similar sentiments. “People always complain about the lack of development works. It’s through voting the right candidate can we give a fitting reply back to those politicians who did not work for the betterment of the society,” said a woman of ward number 69 on condition of anonymity.
 
 For 70-year-old Jasbir Kaur, a resident of ward number 44, voting is not only her duty but her right as a citizen of India. “I am not keeping well but I came here to cast my vote,” she smiled.
