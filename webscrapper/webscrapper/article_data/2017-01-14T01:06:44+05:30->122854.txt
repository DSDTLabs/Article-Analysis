CHENNAI: A stone was thrown at the engine of   on Thursday evening near Thiruvalangadu station on the   section. The stone damaged the lookout glass of the engine. However, nobody was injured and the damage was attended to at the next station in Arakkonam. 

 This comes less than two months after a similar incident near Kadambathur on the same section. The glass of the locomotive pulling the Chennai-Coimbatore intercity express was shattered and a piece of broken glass hit the loco-pilot in the chest, injuring him.
 
 A senior   (RPF) official said an EMU train was stationed nearby as there was a rail fracture. "Because of this, the commuters in that train were irritated and one of them hurled a stone at the train. We are investigating the issue and trying to identify the perpetrator," the official said, adding such incidents were repeated on this section especially when commuters were irritated with delayed train services. In February 2016, a passenger on the Nellai Express was injured when a stone was hurled at the train on the   stretch on the Chennai-Tambaram section.
 
 Loco-pilots say the issue was common in the Chennai division and that citizens should be sensitised on the issue. "Trains run at 110 kmph and if the glass is broken, loco-pilots have to sustain high wind speed while driving. It can also injure passengers and the impact can be really strong as the train is moving fast," said an office-bearer of All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA).
