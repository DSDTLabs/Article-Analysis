PUNE: Two days after large parts of eastern Pune suffered a massive power cut, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has urged citizens to avoid burning   near electricity distribution installations.The nearly 19-hour power cut was caused due to garbage burning around an open trench on   that damaged distribution cables.

 Officials clarified that preventing garbage burning at open public spots will help save electric cables, including those located underground, from da mage. However, citizens are routinely seen dumping garbage near feeder pillars, transformers, DP boxes as well as inside compounds that house transformers and other such installations, the statement said.
 
 Chief engineer of MSEDCL's Pune zone   said, “We appeal to the public not to dump or burn garbage near electricity transformers, overheadunderground electricity lines and distribution cable boxes. Garbage must only be collected or dumped at PMC-notified points. Since last year, there have been four serious cases of cable damage, including in   and Pimpri Chinchwad, due to the same re ason. We are also trying to undertake preventive maintenance, especially at tricky spots around overhead cables.“
 
 A senior MSEDCL spokesperson said that even underground cables are susceptible to damage. “Some people may unknowingly burn garbage in an open trench and the fire could reach the cables located underground. Citizens must behave responsibly and not throw garbage irresponsibly ,“ he said.
 
 Major residential pockets in Vimannagar, Vishrantwadi, Yerawada and  , among others, were in the dark for most of Thursday while MSEDCL engineers repaired the damaged cables.
