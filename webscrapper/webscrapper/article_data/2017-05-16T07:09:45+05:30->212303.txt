NASHIK: Close to 100 large investors and   across the country and abroad will be invited for the ‘Make in Nashik’ event scheduled in Mumbai on May 30 and 31.

 A presentation on investment potentials of Nashik will be given to these business houses to convince them to make investments in Nashik. The focus is also being given to signing MoUs with industries for making investment in Nashik.
 
 An official from the organising committee of the event said, “We will highlight the salient features of Nashik such as climate, abundant water, availability of land, industrial and agricultural hub, etc.”
 
 “We are inviting exporters and other investors also for the event. We are also focusing on actual signing of MoUs,” an official said and added, “The government needs to take efforts to bring some industrial projects to Nashik.”
 
 Nashik had been sidelined during the Make in India event held in Mumbai in February, 2016. As much as 70% of the MoUs signed at the event were for Vidarbha and Marathwada, while remaining were for Pune and other parts of the state. Nashik could attract only 0.25% investment, ie, Rs 2,200 crore, which included Rs 1,500 crore expansion project of the Mahindra & Mahindra. 
 
 After the success by the BJP in the   here, chief minister   has adopted the city. Hence, hopes of local industries have increased and they are expecting good investment from the chief minister for Nashik.
