The new financial model is based on the recommendations of the working group convened in 2016 to consider the 2014 resolutions. It is respectfully submitted that the changes recommended to the constitution and financial model by the ICC Working Group, will result in substantial reduction of share of the BCCI in the ICC revenues and the same will have grave adverse impact on the development of cricket in India.”
 
 The member associations of the BCCI will request the CJI that the applicants -who are the full members of the BCCI -be allowed to call for a Special General Meeting to “discuss and deliberate on the issue of changes recommended by the working group of ICC - one that had been formed by keeping India away. The application to be sub mitted in the SC today states: “Rule 17 of the Rules And Regulations of the BCCI (Revised as on 15 September, 2012) provides that a SGM may be convened by the Secretary a) on directive of the President, b) on resolution of the Working Committee, c) on requisition signed by not less than 10 Full Members specially stating the business to be transacted at such meeting.”
 
 The rule further states that within thirty days of the receipt of the SGM requisition, the requisitionists may themselves convene it for the purpose specified in the requisition.
 
 To further make their point, the BCCI's application to the court has a detailed analysis of the math behind ICC's new model, charts that specify revenue cycles and India's point of view.
