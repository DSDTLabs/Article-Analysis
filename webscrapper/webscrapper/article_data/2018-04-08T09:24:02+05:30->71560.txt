CHENNAI: Investigators are struggling to make headway in tracking the suspects who murdered 23-year-old P Gnanapriya and left her husabnd Prabhu injured at their Vadapalani residence three days ago. 

 Three sets of fingerprints lifted from a safe at the residence have been sent to the forensic laboratory where experts will see if they matching with those of previous offenders. The investigators have also sent the fingerprints of Prabhu, a temple  , for examination.
 
 Special teams are again scanning the footage taken from five CCTV cameras in the area. A police officer said, “The footage hasn’t shown up any suspicious movement in the neighbourhood that night but we are scouring it again. We are not ruling out Prabhu’s name from the suspects list.”
 
 On Friday, Prabhu who said he blacked out after being struck two hard blows on the head and regained consciouness only on Thursday night. He broke down in the police vehicle on the way to the site in   where the remains of his wife, Gnanapriya, were cremated. 
 
 Police officers, acting on the advice of doctors against revealing to him about his wife’s death as there was a danger of him relapsing into unconsciouness, had taken him to Kancheepuram saying Gnanapriya had been shifted there from a city facility. All along the way, Prabhu kept asking the police personnel questions about his wife’s health and if she was okay. And, when the revelation came, he couldn’t take it, a police officer said 
 
 In his statement to the police, Prabhu said he was hit with a thick rod-like material and that he remembered little else about the attack or the assailants. 
 
 The suspects apparently tore a towel found in the house into long strips and tied up his hands, feet and also gagged him, the officer said. They seemed to have used the same material to tie up Gnanapriya too.
