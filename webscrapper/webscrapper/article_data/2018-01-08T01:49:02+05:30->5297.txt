MUMBAI: A 42-year-old consultant employed at an accountancy firm has lodged a complaint against a developer, his wife and his three partners for   him of Rs 2.93 crore. The   police have lodged an FIR under various provisions of the IPC. 

 The complainant,  , said that he sold his house in   and also convinced his sister to sell her house in   so that they could pool in the sale proceeds for him to invest in an underconstruction 700 sq ft flat at Santacruz. But as the   flat cost a lot more than his Kandivli flat and his sisterâ€™s Kalyan flats put together, Salian borrowed money from his friends and relatives. Salian was given an allotment letter for the flat but later found out that the same house was allotted to someone else by the developer. Four years after he invested money in the Santacruz flat, neither was it ready for him to move in nor was he getting back the money invested. He told the developer that he had borrowed heavily, at which the developer asked him to jot down names of all those people and offered to pay them back their money along with 6% commission. 
 
 In January last year, Salian dashed off a letter to the Amboli police station following which the developer offered to give cheques worth the amount that he had invested and convinced him to withdraw his complaint. 
 
 Later, the developer requested Salian to not deposit the cheques in the bank and wait for two years till the apartment was constructed. When Salian realized that he had been conned, he approached the police once again.
