PUNE: Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ) will operate 30 midi buses for women commuters from March 8, International Women’s Day, with more vehicles set to join the fleet in the coming days.

  
 Officials said that some midi buses have been given the tag of women-only   buses with added features. “The women-only midi buses will have proper facilities for women,” an official told TOI.
 
 “The state government had announced Tejaswini bus project for women early last year. We decided to change some midi buses to Tejaswini buses. The changes include installation of CCTV cameras, a public announcement system, dust bins and seat adjustments so that women can feel comfortable,” said the official.
 
 The colour of the bus will be blue and there will be some graphic designs. The total capacity of the bus will be 40 (32 sitting and 8 standing).
 
 PMPML does not have any female driver but there are female conductors who will be deputed on these buses. “Right now, we are awaiting certification for buses from the RTO. After March 8, some more women-only buses will hit the roads, increasing the number to 34,” the official pointed out.
 
 PMPML will also run a fleet of 200 midi buses for all starting this month.
 
 “The women-only buses will run on select routes and will be operated the most during peak hours,” he added.
 
 Swati Deouskar, a resident of Kothrud, told TOI, “I take PMPML buses to PMC everyday and face many issues, including lack of seats. PMPML has to ensure that buses are run well with timely maintenance.”
