CHENNAI: As tipplers rushed to usher in the New year on a high, liquor outlets maintained by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited ( ) registered a record turnover.

 The total sale stood at ₹230 crore during the New Year weekend, an increase of nearly 10% when compared to the same period last year.
 
 This spike in sales comes as a breather for the corporation, a cash cow for the state government, which witnessed a sharp fall (by nearly 14%) in sales during   in 2017 for the first time. Though the corporation’s daily turnover was only around ₹65-₹70 crore, sales began rising from Saturday (December 30) evening.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 On December 31, 2017, Tasmac clocked sales of ₹139 crore, highest in the last five years. This was 75% more than what was reported in 2012.
 
 Liquor worth ₹91crore was sold across Tamil Nadu on day one of the New Year, according to sources.
 
 Officials attributed this increase in sales to reopening of state-run liquor outlets which were shut temporarily due to the Supreme Court’s highway liquor ban. After SC diluted its order, the number of shops increased from 4,900 to nearly 6,000 recently.
 
 Customers, on the other hand, complained that many outlets, particularly elite shops, collected money over and above the maximum retail price (MRP). “Though the labels affixed on the bottle said   was ₹720, the salesman at an elite shop in   collected ₹830. The salesman claimed tax slabs were revised recently,” said a customer, requesting anonymity.
 
 Others say many shops still do not give bills for the purchase, despite requests from customers.
