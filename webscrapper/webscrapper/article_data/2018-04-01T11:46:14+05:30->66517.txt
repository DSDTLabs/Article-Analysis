SECUNDERABAD: Days after announcing special trains for summer between   and  , South Central   (SCR) put four services on hold due to lack of reservations.

 In a bid to clear extra passenger rush, the railways had decided to roll out 42 weekly special trains, of which 26 were to run till Jabalpur via Itarsi, Khandwa and Akola. The special services were scheduled on April 3, 10, 17 and 24; May 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 and June 5, 12, 19 and 26.
 
 Unlike previous years, the first leg of the special services, scheduled on April 2 and 9 from Jabalpur and April 3 and 10 from Secunderabad, elicited poor response. This prompted the railways to halt these services.
 
 “Those who have booked tickets for the cancelled trains will get their money refunded,” said a railway official. Sources said that the railways might run the rest of the special trains if the reservation picks up for the service later on.
