CUTTACK:   deserve a vote of thanks from  . Their 3-1 win over   may not have earned them a passage to the Federation Cup semifinals, but it gave the Kolkata giants a berth in the last four even before they took the field for their last group match against the already-qualified   FC.

 A victory for Churchill would have spiced things up in Group A and made the late kickoff on the day the decider for the second knockout berth from the group. But that was not to be as Chennai put up an all-around performance to bow out of the tournament with a morale-boosting victory.
 
 Tamil Nadu boys Dhanpal Ganesh (18th) and Edwin Vanspaul (61st) and Brazilian Charles de Souza (79th) were all on target at Barabati Stadium while Churchill's Brandon Fernandes (82nd) pulled one back for his team as both teams ended their campaign at the domestic tournament.
 
 It was unlucky for Derrick Perreira's side as they had a splendid Brandon free-kick in the 31st minute hit the crossbar and were also the victim of a wrong offside decision by the assistant referee when Kromah was in a one-to-one situation with Chennai goalie Shahin in the 48th minute.
 
 Churchill, who knew that a win against Chennai would make the late tie one that East Bengal could not afford to lose, began in earnest, with Ansumana Kromah and Brandon looking for an early breakthrough. But the four-man Chennai defence met their moves with resolution and did not leave much space for the Churchill attackers to take advantage of.
 
 The opening goal came in the 18th minute from a brilliant solo effort from Ganesh, after being released with the ball on the right flank.
