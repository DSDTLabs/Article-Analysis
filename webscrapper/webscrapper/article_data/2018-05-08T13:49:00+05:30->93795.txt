RANCHI: Medicos studying at Ranchi's   (Rims) are averse to working in government run rural health-care centers of the state. Post-graduate students at the state-run medical college hospital wore black badges to work on Monday protesting the state health ministry's new mandate which makes it compulsory for PG students to work for the state health services for three years after completing studies. 

 The Jharkhand chapter of Junior Doctors' Association (JDA) dispatched a letter to health secretary   and sought rollback of the mandate, which was notified recently after receiving the state cabinet's nod on April 24.
 
 The medicos announced to sit on dharna first and then go on an indefinite strike if there was no response from the ministry by Wednesday.
 
 The ministry had first passed an order in 2015 where PG students had to sign a bond at the time of admission in state run colleges. Under the bond, they were to work for at least a year in state health services. On April 24, the cabinet allowed to the ministry to raise the service bond for PG students to three years. A penalty of Rs 30 lakh was also provisioned. Those who do not join the service within six months of passing out will be considered violators. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, JDA Jharkhand president   said the move will be harsh for the PG students of 2015, 2016 and 2017 academic sessions have already signed a service bond of one year during admission. "We demand that the new mandate must be made effective for 2018 batch," he added. 
 
 Khare, on the other hand, was not available for comments when contacted. 
 
 The practice of service bond was started in 2015 to make up for shortage of doctors in state health services. There are 4,000 doctors in the state against a sanctioned strength of 11,000.
