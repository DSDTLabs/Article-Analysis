Hyderabad: After missing several deadlines, the RCEP talks may well conclude next year, making the treaty a reality, RCEP Trade Negotiating Committee chief, Iman Pambagyo, said here on Monday.

 “The more we get into the greater detail of the negotiations, the more we realise that the challenges that we are facing are humongous. I am hopeful that in 2018, the negotiations could be completed, provided the countries could exert some more flexibility to help others stay on, but at the same time not so much as to compromise on the commercial value ….,” Pambagyo said.
 
 He pointed out that in the 19th round of negotiations being held in Hyderabad, the two broad areas of focus are – ‘market access negotiations’ and ‘rules’ on areas such as cooperation in custom procedures, e-commerce and IPR, among others. Rooting for a comprehensive RCEP in the region, Pambagyo pointed out that there are around five to six pairs of countries that do not have bilateral FTAs and therefore RCEP will be the first FTA relations among themselves in addition to ASEAN.
 
 This apart, he added that through RCEP, the participating countries would be able to expand and deepen their supply chain network. However, while striving for uniformity, RCEP will allow flexibility as well as room for limited deviations from common concession principals for some partners, who do not benefit from the framework. On being asked about the impact of the current standoff between India and China on the trade talks, he said, “Non-trade and non-economic issues do not interfere in our process of negotiating with RCEP members... I think China has been quite constructive and even India has been equally constructive." The last round of negotiations this year is slated to be held in October in Korea, before which ministerial level talks are to be held in Manila, Philippines.
