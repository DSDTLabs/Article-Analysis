A notable aspect of Sairam’s presentation was kalpanaswaram, which sparkled in its simplicity.” Kalpanaswaram refers to improvisation, which is a collaboration between an artist’s inklings and rasikas’ wordless expectations. Sairam’s essay also included Kharaharapriya. “Carnatic music is rooted in devotion,” Ravi said. “And ‘swara’ is the shine that the self has acquired.

In Sairam’s notes, one hears the patter of young Krishna’s feet; the outraged hiss; the lurching of the hood; the swell of the ocean; and eventually, the sound of good stamping its authority.
