Model-actress   said she abruptly left a fashion show as she does not support animals being branded and whipped. According to report, after multiple reports claimed the daughter of the late   'stormed out' of a Couture spring/summer 2019 Cruise collection presentation in France, the 20-year-old model released a statement on Twitter on Tuesday.

  
  
 Paris wrote, "To be clear, I did not 'storm out' of the show. I quietly got up and walked out trying my hardest to not cause a scene, because I do not support animals being branded and whipped. Not trying to become enemies in the fashion world in any way, but I will always be myself."
 
  
  
 A source told that Paris left the event as she had concerns about how the horses were treated during the label's highly produced show meant to showcase a women's rodeo.
 
 "She was uncomfortable with how the horses were being handled (the whipping sound was loud) so she quietly slipped out," the source said, referring to the female rodeo riders who performed on horses during the show.
 
 "The ladies performing with the horses were riding side-saddle so they had to use a crop to get the horses to go straight and it was pouring rain with no tent. Paris meant no disrespect to the brand. She loved the collection and had a wonderful time in Paris." the source added.
