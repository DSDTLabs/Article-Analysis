Panaji: In an attempt to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the city’s streets, experts at the   Foundation, together with the CCP, have initiated a project called ‘Guidelines for commercial signage in Panaji’. 

 As part of the project, the foundation has invited ideas to design signages for a select area along M G Road. The idea is to reconstruct the street and show people, especially those who run commercial establishments out of heritage buildings along it, that the character of the place can be enhanced by mere uniformity in design of the signages.
 
 A competition has been announced by the foundation in this regard. Titled, ‘Re-imagining commercial signage in Panaji’, it is open to architects, graphic designers and town planners. 
 
 A series of events will be held over March 24 and 25 at Fundacao Oriente, while an exhibition of the submitted works will be held on March 30 and 31 at Azad Maidan.
