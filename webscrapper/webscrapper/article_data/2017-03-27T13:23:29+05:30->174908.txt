 Airline enthusiast Gunadeep Narendrapuram said, “For the first time, Air India will be offering two-way flights between Raipur and Vizag and this will provide better connectivity between AP and Chhattisgarh.   details from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation indicate that the number of passengers has increased rapidly during the last one year. While in January 2016, only around 390 passengers travelled on the Vizag-Raipur route, it increased to 733 in January 2017. This will ease travel between these two cities. Also, the new routes will help pilgrims from north coastal AP travelling to Tirupati. The travel time will be just about two-and-half hours as against the existing train time, which takes around 12 hours.” With Visakhapatnam Airport handling nearly 1.9 million passengers between April 2016 and January 2017, airport sources said more number of airlines may station their aircraft at Vizag to cater to the growing traffic.
