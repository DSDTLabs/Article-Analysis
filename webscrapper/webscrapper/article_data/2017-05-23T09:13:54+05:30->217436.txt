NEW DELHI:   and officials of   (FRRO) detained 19 women and a minor girl from two houses in south Delhi after they were found to be staying in the city without valid documents. 

 Police suspect that the women were forced into flesh trade. Legal action has been initiated against the house owners. A team led by ACP (crime against women cell)   and ACP (operations) Palvinder Singh was formed to probe into the complaints received of illegal activities happening in the two houses — one in Malviya Nagar and the other in Vasant Kunj. 
 
 “A raid was conducted and it was found that the women were staying there without valid documents. They could not give their reasons to visit India,” said a police officer. Sources said that the raid was conducted after locals reported about people creating a ruckus on different occasions outside the houses late at night.
 
 After FRRO was informed about the women and the minor, their respective embassies were contacted. All of them were found to be residents of Central Asian countries and claimed to have come here for jobs. Police said that a former head constable of Delhi Police, Devinder Singh, was found to be the owner of one of the houses. Singh had taken voluntary retirement from the force and had rented out his house. Police are questioning him to find out whether he was involved in promoting the illegal trade.
 
 Police suspect the involvement of an international racket and have sealed both the houses. A case will be registered against the owners. The women were questioned by the police on Monday night.
