PUNE: In a public notice issued on Thursday, the Pune Cantonment Board ( ) has directed all stall owners operating in the Fashion Street market to remove illegal encroachments in the next seven days.

 The board also directed all authorized stall owners to submit the copies of their allotment letters by February 15.
 
 Chief executive officer DN Yadav told TOI on Friday, “Those who are running their businesses without any allotment are strictly directed to vacate the defence land within seven days, failing which they will face action.”
 
 The audit report submitted by the fire brigade department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has highlighted the lack of fire safety measures in the market. The issue was discussed in a special general body meeting held earlier this week.
 
 The audit report shows that the complex, where nearly 500 traders have set up shops, does not have passageways wide enough for evacuation in case of a fire-related emergency. The approaches to the market are also not wide enough to accommodate fire engines. The traders have extensively used flammable materials to construct their stalls, which also double up as residences. Only a few shops have in-house firefighting measures, like extinguishers, the report noted.
 
 “The revenue department has already undertaken inspection at the complex against illegal stalls. It will submit a report on Saturday based on which, further course of action will be decided,” Yadav said.
 
 Meanwhile, some vendors said the board should give at least a month’s time for setting up these safety measures.
 
 “Had the board paid attention to the market in the past, it would not have become what it is today. Now, the board wants us to set up fire safety equipment in seven days. It’s not a practical move,” a stall owner said.
