MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench has restrained the   collector and superintendent of police from interfering in a case related to the erection of DMK flag masts on private lands. 

 Deputy secretary of DMK state youth wing, S Joel, in his petition, told the court on Tuesday that the Tuticorin tahsildar, at the behest of the collector trespassed into private lands at two places near the airport on February 27, cut the ropes of the DMK poles installed there and tore the party flags.
 
 The petitionerâ€™s counsel said that after obtaining no objection certificates from the   (AAI) and certificates regarding structural design from chartered engineer and panel valuer, the petitioner constructed structures in the lands belonging to Peter Jebaraj in   village and of T Dinesh in   village. The land owners also gave permission for the constructions.
 
 For the structures also, the petitioner obtained stability certificates. The assistant superintendent of police also gave permission to hoist the flag. Following it, the Thiruverumbur   raised the flag on February 24, the counsel said.
 
 In this backdrop, the authorities wanted to remove the structure and flags and acted in a high-handed manner, whose actions are illegal. Thus, it was apprehended that the authorities would do the same in other places. Therefore, it was necessary to restrain them from doing so, the counsel prayed. After hearing, justice P  , adjourned the case to March 15.
