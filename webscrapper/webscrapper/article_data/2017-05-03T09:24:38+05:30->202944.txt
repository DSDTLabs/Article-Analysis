PUNE:  , who was arrested last month for allegedly   of Rs 32 lakh on the promise of admissions in foreign universities,  ,  

 The consultant, identified as   (40), was operating from a college on Fergusson College Road. She was arrested on April 28 after two students lodged an FIR against her on April 23.
 
 In their complaints, the students stated that Deshmukh had collected Rs 32 lakh from them on the promise of securing their admissions for MS in Electronics at universities in the US.
 
 On Monday, one more student lodged a complaint accusing Deshmukh of cheating her of Rs 23 lakh. Senior inspector   of the Shivajinagar police told TOI that the latest case relates to a 23-year-old girl who wanted to pursue her MS (Computers) from an university in the US.
 
 “Deshmukh took Rs 23 lakh from her. She had promised the student to keep the money in a bank account in her name. But she never opened such a bank account, instead she used the money for personal purposes,” Mokashi said. 
 
 Besides her, two more students have approached the police stating that Deshmukh cheated them for Rs 10 lakh and Rs 6 lakh, respectively. “These two students also wanted to pursue their higher education in the US. We have asked them to bring the relevant documents that Deshmukh had prepared and given to them. They will file their complaints after they bring all these documents. We suspect the number of victims in this case may rise in the coming days,” the officer said.
 
 For now, the police suspect that Deshmukh may have cheated people of Rs 75 lakh. Though this is just a preliminary estimate and the amount may rise as more complainants emerge, police said.
 
 Mokashi said Deshmukh had locked her office on April 10 after realising that the students have approached the police.
