Motor third-party  , also referred as 'act only' cover, is a statutory requirement as stated under the Motor Vehicles Act.

 It is called as a 'third-party' cover because the beneficiary of the policy is somebody else other than the two parties involved in the contract that is, the insured and the insurance company. This policy does not provide any benefit to the insured but does cover the insured's legal liability for death/disability of third party loss or damage to third party property.
 
 
 
 Motor third-party insurance is a policy under which the insurance company offers to compensate the insured person. This is prevalent in case the insurer has sued or is held legally liable for injuries/damage done to a third party. The insured is the first party, the insurance company is the second party, and the person the insured injure or who claims damages is the third party.
 
 Explaining it further, it:
 
 
 
 As per the law, the third-party insurance cover is compulsory; all non-life insurance companies are bound to provide this cover. As per Indian context, automobile dealers arrange for the insurance cover along with vehicle registration. This cover acts as an add-on to the mandatory third-party cover and protects the owner from monetary losses, caused because of theft or damage to the vehicle.
 
 The cost of this   is sometimes is that of a stand-alone third-party cover, because the damage claims are frequent than third-party claims.
