 and   star  , who have been dating for quite some time, is now engaged. The   ceremony took place yesterday in Hyderabad. A source says, “The engagement was a simple, private affair, which was attended by a few close friends and their families. They will tie the knot in December this year.”

 
 
 We hear that Samantha’s engagement will not make any difference to her film career. The actress will continue to act in movies. She has four Tamil films in her kitty this year, including a project with Vijay. She is busy in Tollywood, too.
 
 Meanwhile, the news about Malayali actress Anupama Parameswaran not being part of the Telugu film, starring Ram Charan, directed by Sukumar, made headlines recently. Samantha has now replaced Anupama in the movie and she will start shooting for the film soon.
 
 
 
 A source close to Samantha says, “Yes, she will be a part of the film and it’s the first time that Ram Charan and Sam would work together. She was impressed with the project as she felt it is a refreshing, village-based subject. It is expected that she will join the team on February 15.”Earlier, we had learnt that the crew decided to say no to Anupama as they were on the lookout to add to the ‘glam quotient’ of the project. Meanwhile, Samantha will also soon start working on the Telugu film Savitri, starring Keerthy Suresh.
