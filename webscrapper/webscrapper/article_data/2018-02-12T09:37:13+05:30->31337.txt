HYDERABAD: Hyderabad   Rail, announced the successful completion of the 392 feet-long   ( ) project on Sunday. Thus bridging the only gap in Corridor 1 that runs between Ameerpet and L B Nagar.

 According to   managing director  , who inspected the ROB works on Sunday, several locational hurdles and space hurdles had to be dodged for the successful completion of the bridge “At Lakdikapul, the tracks of Indian Railways are in a deep cutting (about 26 ft) below the road level and no space was available for laying the foundations and Metro Rail pillars on both sides of the railway track due to presence of a busy road on one side and MMTS station, RR district collectorate building and a private hospital on the other side.
 
 
 “The area also has hard granite rock and to cut the rock to a depth of 43 ft posed a serious challenge for the engineers. Since the foundations had to be laid adjacent to the busy road with heavy traffic, the deeply dug pits had to be secured with special shoring and shuttering mechanism, consisting of heavy steel beams with extra protection.
  
 
 
 “That would have ensured that the road did not cave in at any point of time during the construction of the Metro pillars on both sides of the railway track,” said Metro rail authorities.
 
 Another important engineering challenge was to design a special type of integrated Metro pillar and the viaduct above as a single monolithic structure unlike other bridge pillars which have bearings.
 
 Normally any bridge pillar will have bearings to accommodate and take care of vertical and horizontal forces.
 
 “The Lakdikapul ROB was successfully completed by using specially fabricated ‘Bridge Builder’ as it was done in case of  ,” said NVS Reddy.
 
 Movement and erection of the ‘Bridge Builder’ device weighing about 100 tonnes and heavy duty cranes to lift the precast segments etc., with all safety precautions and without causing disruption to the round-the-clock train, MMTS operations, passengers and the heavy road traffic was a big challenge, he emphasized
