I came to Hyderabad in 2017 and enrolled myself for a course in  . Initially, it was very difficult for me to adjust to the college and its atmosphere. I still remember my first day in the college. I was so tensed the moment I entered it. I felt like a total stranger with all new faces staring at me. Not knowing the local language was a disadvantage too, so I kept quiet most of the time. 
However, with time, everything has changed for me. Now, I’m more confident with my language as my friends understand me and I understand what they say.   has been great so far, and the teachers, students and the faculty have always been very supportive. Teachers take extra classes to help us learn the subjects. Last year, my focus was only on passing the exams but this year I’ll focus on getting good marks. This college has had a tremendous influence on me, and has moulded me into a confident and independent girl.
