New Delhi: Sample this: as many as 23% of commercial vehicles and 40-60% of heavy trucks entering   daily are not destined for the capital. In a move that could go some way in decongesting the city and also reduce pollution, the   on Thursday launched the Roll On-Roll Off service for NCR.

 RO-RO is a multimodal transport service, which can help decongest Delhi by transporting trucks on railway flat wagons and unloading them after carrying them across Delhi. 
 
 A pilot run — from Garhi Harsaru in Gurgaon to Murad Nagar — was flagged off from Patel Nagar railway station on Thursday by railway minister Suresh Prabhu through a videoconferencing session.
 
 Officials say each flag wagon can carry two trucks, with the train having a capacity of 40 trucks. The journey frequencies will be increased once the trial run is tested and approved.
 
 “The initiative will not only improve the ambient air quality but also reduce the load on roads. Truck drivers will get time to rest and can operate during daytime too when their entry is restricted,” a Northern Railway official said.
 
 According to a study by the Centre for Science Environment, commercial vehicles entering Delhi spew close to 30% of total particulate matter and 22% of nitrogen-oxide load from the transport sector.
 
 RO-RO services were first implemented by Konkan Railways and then extended to the Eastern Central Railways and the Northeast Frontier Railway. 
 
 “Queues at the entry points will be reduced considerably,” said an official.
