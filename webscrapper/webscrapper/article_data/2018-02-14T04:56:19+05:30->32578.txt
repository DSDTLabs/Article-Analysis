NEW DELHI: Culture minister Mahesh Sharma on Tuesday said his ministry has decided to open two museums dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra   in Delhi and Kolkata. Stating that Bose had not received his due in history, Sharma said the centre in Delhi would be set up through the Indian National Army. 

 “We have decided that through the Indian National Army, we will create a grand museum on Bose. In fact, we have also spoken to DDA to get space in Delhi,” Sharma said. 
 
 He also said his ministry was exploring the possibility of using 24 acres of the existing Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts to build the museum, should the proposal to DDA not come through. In Kolkata, the museum is being planned in the old National Library building. 
 
 The museum will display documents and other things related to four Bengal icons — Bose, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore, and   ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee. 
 
 Sharma said the culture ministry had started work on three museums in Uttar Pradesh — a Ram museum in Ayodhya, a Kumbh museum in Allahabad and a museum in   that would include Guru Gorakhnath of Gorakshpeeth, of which Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is the çhief priest.
