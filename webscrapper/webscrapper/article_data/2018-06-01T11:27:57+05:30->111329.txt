MOHALI: After being declared smoke-free,   will soon be declared tobacco-free.   labour minister Balbir   and civil surgeon Dr Rita Bhardwaj said this during a function held to commemorate World No   Day on Thursday. 

 Experts and local authorities deliberated on the ill-effects of tobacco and its growing consumption in Punjab. Balbir Singh Sidhu asked NGOs to visit rural areas and spread awareness in places where there is zero literacy. 
 
 The minister observed that most patients report to hospitals only after they contract cancer. He also said Punjab government would extend support to those working towards curbing the menace. 
 
 Dr Rita Bhardwaj listed steps being taken to curb the menace and shared details on cancer cases being reported in government hospitals. She said Mohali has been declared smoke-free and will soon be made tobacco-free as well. 
 
 Saying that this could only be done with the support of people, she said there is a need for awareness as tobacco consumption and associated fatalities are on the rise. She urged people to give up tobacco for their own sake.
