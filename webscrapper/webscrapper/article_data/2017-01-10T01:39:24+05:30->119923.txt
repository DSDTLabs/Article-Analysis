GURGAON: Mor Dhwaj (25), who was   several times by his  , started showing signs of   on Monday.

 Dhwaj, the youngest of four children of retired soldier Jagdish Chandra (60) and a lawyer practising in Gurgaon district court, was known to come home   on most nights, police said. When he returned drunk around 8.30pm on Friday to his home in Patel Nagar, he had an argument with his sister, who was visiting the family from Pachgaon, where she lives with her husband and his family. 
 
 As the argument heated up, Dhwaj hit his sister and parents, then reached out for a licensed revolver kept in the cupboard nearby, and headed for Jagdish. Dhwaj’s mother Rama Devi snatched the revolver from him and handed it over to Jagdish, who shot at his   in self defence, as per the complaint lodged by Rama Devi at the Civil Lines police station. 
 
 Doctors treating Dhwaj at Paras Hospital informed that he was brought in a critical condition and was immediately operated upon on Friday night. Dr Rakesh Durkhure, senior consultant, general surgery, said, “His large intestine was completely damaged. We performed a colostomy and repaired the bullet wounds.” 
 
 Two bullets and a pellet are still lodged inside Dhwaj’s body. One bullet is lodged close to his left kidney, while the other is in the right side of the chest wall near the lungs, said the doctor. “They will be taken out in subsequent surgeries, after his wounds heal,” Dr Durkhure added. 
 
 Jagdish has been absconding since the incident.
