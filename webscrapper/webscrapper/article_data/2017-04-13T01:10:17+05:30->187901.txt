NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and senior Congressman   on Wednesday joined morning walkers at Jahanpanah Forest in Greater Kailash-II for the party’s “Dilli Ki Baat, Dil ke Saath” campaign for the municipal polls scheduled to be held on April 23.

 Expressing his dissatisfaction towards the appalling state of affairs and the student-teachers ratio in municipal schools, the former minister said that once in power they will ensure that Right To Education rules are strictly followed.
 
 “It is shameful that in the national capital more than 50,000 students quit primary schools in the last three years. While no municipal school has initiated computer education, many of them do not even have basic facilities, like benches and tables,” Tharoor said.
 
 Tharoor said that Congress will form an “expert group” for improving education in primary schools. “A group of people with national and international experience will be put together to revolutionise education in municipal schools,” he added.
 
 Slamming chief minister  , Tharoor sought a response on how almost 1 lakh students quit government schools in two years of the AAP rule. “The dipping pass percentage in Delhi government schools is disturbing. During the Congress government, the pass percentage of Class X students was 98.4%. It has dipped to 91.76% under the AAP government,” he said.
 
 The former minister announced that Congress will provide free health insurance to students of municipal schools. He added that Rs 1,000 will be deposited in every student’s bank account, which they will get only once they pass Class XII.
 
 On Thursday, former Union minister Jairam Ramesh will interact with people near Bhalswa landfill site and discuss the roadmap on improving the sanitation condition in the city. Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said that unlike BJP and AAP, his party is only focussing upon providing solutions to the existing problems in their campaign.
