Ahmedabad: While a ‘Transgender Welfare Board’ has been established in several Indian states after the Supreme Court ruling of 2014, Gujarat still does not have such a board that would directly look into the issues of   community. In the wake of this, the transgender community in Gujarat supported by Vadodara-based Lakshya Trust and Voluntary Health Organization based in Chennai, made a representation before the state government seeking to form ‘Transgender Welfare Board’ in the state, on Friday.

 Several issues pertaining to the community were discussed during a gathering on ‘Transgender Day Event 2018’. A few of these issues include lack of access to basic facilities such as affordable housing, healthcare and employment opportunities, among others.
 
 Sylvester Merchant, community leader, Lakshya Trust, said, “Transgender Welfare Board is a must in the state, so that the government is able to focus on issues pertaining to the transgender community. The board should be such where all parties are represented. At present, there are few government departments which recognize transgenders.”
 
 Some of the members of the community also shared their experiences of coming out and the issues they encountered in the process. “If a woman gets married, there is a definite procedure for getting her name changed. Now that the Supreme Court has recognized transgender as a third gender, there should be a similar process in place for the transgenders as well,” said one of the representatives.
