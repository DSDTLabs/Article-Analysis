LUCKNOW: Once seen as the root of the SP family feud, erstwhile Qaumi Ekta Dal MLA Sibghatullah Ansari’s presence at Akhilesh Yadav’s meeting took everyone by surprise. Another equally unexpected presence was that of Mulayam loyalist Gayatri Prasad Prajapati and Shivpal’s close aide and SP MLC Jitendra Yadav who joined in   their support to Akhilesh Yadav as national president of the SP.

 The merger of QED with SP was the tipping point of the strained relations between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal who had reached out to   QED for a pact. Later, at the instance of Akhilesh, SP called off the merger though later Mulayam went ahead with it, pushing aside Akhilesh’s objection. Finally, Sibhgatullah’s name appeared in the list of candidates announced by  . “I signed the   as national president of the SP,” said Sibghatullah talking to TOI.
 
 Gayatri Prajapati too has been a contributing factor in the entire crises as he was initially sacked from the cabinet by Akhilesh only to be reinstated at Mulayam’s instance. Gayatri had stayed away from the Sunday’s special convention where Akhilesh was crowned the SP national president, though he called up on the chief ministers to the latter’s official residence on Wednesday. On Thursday, he too signed an affidavit supporting Akhilesh as SP chief.
