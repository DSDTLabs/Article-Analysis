BHOPAL: Admission and   ( ) has decided to issue notices to dental colleges in the state, directorate of medical education (DME) and   (MPMSU) regarding 856 students whose admission was cancelled by the high court. The committee is looking into the matter how these students were admitted by colleges when they were not eligible.

Surprisingly, over 856 students were allegedly enrolled in dental colleges on the basis of their Class 12 examination marks and not through entrance test. On Saturday, a group of students met AFRC authorities to highlight the issue.
 
  A student without quoting his name said, "After the HC decision I came to know that my admission was illegal. If it was illegal why I was given admission. Now, I suddenly find myself on road." There are 14 private dental colleges in Madhya Pradesh. Students claimed that several pass-out of dental colleges also took admission through the same process in the past. "In this way, degrees of such students should be made illegal by authorities," students said. 
 
 However, students claimed almost 50% students had appeared for the DMAT. "I had appeared in DMAT. However, college has now cancelled my admission citing the reason that I had below 50% in  ," said a student. He says: "In the DMAT, there was only ranking. We did not know our percentage. The college has the information about our percentage. Why college gave us admission." 
 
 A senior official of AFRC said   (DCI) has requested the court to give one time relaxation to such students. "Colleges admitted them despite knowing the fact that they were not eligible. In this manner, colleges have to take the onus. A letter will be issued in this regard," said AFRC official.
