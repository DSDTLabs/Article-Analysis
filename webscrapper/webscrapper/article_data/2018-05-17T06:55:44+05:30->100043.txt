NEW DELHI: Referring to a slew of constitutional norms and Supreme Court orders, BJP on Wednesday justified Karnataka governor  's decision to invite B S Yeddyurappa to take oath as CM and countered Congress's accusations of illegality. 

 
 L aw minister   reminded Congress leaders about Rajiv Gandhi's decision in 1989 of not staking claim to form the government despite heading the single-largest party. "Rahul Gandhi and Soniaji keep talking about family legacy. Let me remind that even Rajiv Gandhi had refused to stake claim in 1989 despite being the single largest party and said the mandate was for V P Singh. Congress should at least take lessons from its own leaders," Prasad said. 
 
 He read out relevant parts of the Sarkaria and Punchi commission reports to justify BJP's claim to government formation as he said the two commissions had suggested that a pre-poll alliance, single largest party or post-poll alliance, in that order, should be invited to form government. 
 
  He said the SC judgment in Bommai case was irrelevant in Karnataka as the order was about a government losing the vote of confidence and then having to prove majority. He cited a recent SC judgment in Arunachal Pradesh matter in which the court had said it had no different view from Sarkaria and Punchi commissions over discretion of the governor to invite a party for government formation. 
 
 P rasad questioned Congress's moral claims as he reminded how the Congress at the Centre had dismissed four BJP governments in 1992 after Babri Masjid demolition even as the other three states - Rajasthan, MP and Delhi - had nothing to do with it.
