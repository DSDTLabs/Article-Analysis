KOLKATA: The police probe into the two incidents at   that was reported on Tuesday has now established that both incidents were prima facie either natural deaths or suicide and not necessarily homicidal in nature.

 Police said in the first incident, Manik Raut, a hawker by profession, had died after developing certain complications on Sunday night. He was rushed to the M R   where he was later declared dead. “It was a single instance of natural death. We have not found any formal complaint in this case so far,“ said a senior investigating officer from Regent Park. Sources in the police said the death of another person, potato trader   (55), was a case of suicide. “Saha was depressed after his mother's death. She had died a month ago. He had gone missing on Saturday and his body was found floating in the   pond the next day. A missing case had already been registered in this regard on Saturday. It seems to be a case of suicide. The family too has not made any other complaint,“ said the officer at Regent Park.
