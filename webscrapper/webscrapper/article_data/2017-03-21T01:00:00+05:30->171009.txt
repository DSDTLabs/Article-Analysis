This Sunday, Gurgaon saw 'drives' of a different kind as 28 vintage cars rolled down the city's roads for a vintage car rally. The rally started from   Golf and Country Club, from where the convoy reached Cyber Hub, before heading towards Delhi. 

  As the cars drove around the city, the sight had other motorists frequently stopping to click pictures of the beauties. For onlookers, a convoy of over two dozen vintage cars cruising along the city roads was a rather new experience. Akshat Kapoor, who spotted the convoy near Cyber Hub, told us, "You see a lot of SUVs and 4x4s on Gurgaon roads, but this was a totally new and refreshing sight."

  Former Asia-Pacific Rally Car champion Gaurav Gill was also present at Cyber Hub to interact with the participants and flag them off for the final stretch of the rally. Quite impressed with the concept of the rally, he told us, "You won’t get to see a better contrast than this – beautiful vintage cars in a completely modern and urban setting. I hope that the next time something like this happens, I have one of these to drive on Gurgaon's roads."

  The participants of the rally also found the experience quite exhilarating. Aditi Anand, who drove a red 1947 MG YT, said, "I was really looking forward to the rally. When you are driving in this car and other motorists look at you in awe, it gives you a sort of celeb status on the road". Vikram Malik, who was driving his 1967 Shelby Cobra, added, "It's always fun to take this car out for a spin. Although it is built for the racetrack, Gurgaon roads are a good substitute. Moreover, driving alongside other vintage beauties was some experience."
