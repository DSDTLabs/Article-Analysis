HYDERABAD: The family of a 45-year-old woman, working as a domestic help in Saudi Arabia, approached South Zone   on Wednesday alleging that she was being tortured by her employers. Based on the complaint, police registered a cheating case against a  , who had sent the victim to Saudi Arabia, and initiated steps to bring her back.

 Hameeda Begum, a house wife from Talabkatta, on Wednesday told police that her mother Khairun Bi, along with five other women were sent to Riyadh on December 14, 2016 by travel agent Ali Sha Basha and his sister by assuring Rs 25,000 monthly salary.
 
 “Basha and his sister had approached us saying that a Riyadh-based family was looking for a domestic help (kadama). Ali said that my mother had to take care of just four children. As my mother wanted to provide for my handicapped brother, she accepted the offer,“ Hameeda said.
 
 However, after going to Saudi, Khairun never spoke to her family and whenever Hameeda approached Ali, he sent her away saying that her mother was doing well. “On Tuesday, Hameeda received a call from a woman who speaking in Telugu, told her that Khairun was suffering from diabetes and thyroid problems and her condition was very bad.The woman also sent Khairun's videos on WhatsApp, in which she was seen crying in agony,“ DCP Satyanarayana said.
 
 The Bhavani Nagar police registered a case against Ali and his sister under section 420 (cheating) of the IPC. MBT leader Amjedullah Khan told TOI that Khairun was being made to work for four to five households and the employers were not even providing for her basic medical facilities. “I have tweeted external affairs minister   and got a call from our embassy in Saudi Arabia. The embassy officials spoke to Hameeda and the woman, who is with Khairun in Saudi, to locate her. I was told that the employer was instructed by the embassy to immediately shift the victim to a hospital and she is expected to reach Hyderabad soon,“ Khan told TOI.
