MUMBAI: The managing committee of the   (RWITC) has refused the Western India Trainers' Association's (WITA) request to bring in   to help them settle the contentious issue of management of their Benevolent Fund.

 It is nothing less than a setback for the WITA, which has been trying to resolve the issue with the RWITC since last two years.
 
 “The managing committee decided, by majority, that they would themselves resolve this matter without outside mediation. Hence Dr Cyrus Poonawalla's magnanimous acceptance to the trainers desire that he mediate, was not accepted,” RWITC chairman Vivek Jain told TOI. 
 
 Subsequently, RWITC has appointed committee member Geoffrey Nagpal to carry on talks with WITA. “After some discussion, Nagpal was nominated to liaise with the trainers and arrive at a decision. He was authorised to choose other members, if any, to assist him,” Jain added.
 
 WITA, however, has not lost hope. “We only want our issue to be settled at the earliest as few of our members have retired and are awaiting their retirement funds to be released,” said a WITA representative.
 
 According to sources, Nagpal has sought the assistance of veteran administrator Shivlal Daga, a member of  , who enjoys good respect in the racing fraternity. One understands that the meeting between RWITC and WITA may happen either on March 17 or 20.
 
 Interestingly, before the RWITC blocked Poonawalla's intervention, it had asked WITA to seek Poonawalla's consent and accordingly inform the club if he is willing to mediate on the issue.
 
 When asked for his comment on it, Jain said: “It was Poonawalla's condition, that WITA must officially request his mediation. And before the committee could consider this option, WITA needed to have it cleared by Poonawalla before writing to us that they desired his intervention.”
