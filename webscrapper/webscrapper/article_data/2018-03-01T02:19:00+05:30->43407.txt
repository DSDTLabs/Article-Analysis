Nagpur: After Supreme Court’s directives, controversial lawyer Satish Uke personally tendered his unconditional apology in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday.   In his application for cancellation of bailable warrant issued on March 22 last year, he also agreed to withdraw all baseless and frivolous allegations made against the HC judges after which the hearing was adjourned till March 15. He made a rare appearance after being on run for nearly a year.    A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Murlidhar Giratkar tersely observed that genuiness of his apology is required to be looked into. The judges appointed Firdos Mirza to assist the court as amicus curiae from HC’s side. The registry was directed to hand over entire paper-book along with the applications filed therein to him.    The next hearing was fixed after asking Uke, who assured the court that he would remain present on every hearing, according to additional public prosecutor (APP) Ketki Joshi.    On February 7, the apex court permitted him to tender an unconditional apology before the HC judges for scandalizing the court and vilifying the judicial process. He was convicted for contempt by the Nagpur bench in February last year and sentenced to two months imprisonment.    SC’s division bench comprising of justices Ranjan Gogoi and Navin Sinha granted him a last opportunity while hearing his review petition filed through senior counsel Kapil Sibal, the former HRD minister in UPA government. He was charged with abusing the legal process by filing fake and frivolous litigations before the HC.    The petitioner gained a notorious reputation of moving various applications, seeking transfer of cases, asking judges to recuse, seeking exemption from appearing in court, and adjournments to move the SC. After showing leniency for a considerable period, the HC moved a suomotu contempt petition initiated by justice Deshpande.
