PATNA: If all goes well, the number of inbound and outbound flights may go up from existing 27 each to 51 each after the Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport at Patna is thrown open for 24x7 operations from March 25.

 “As per the schedule submitted by different airlines, 49 flights are proposed to operate from the city airport on weekdays and 51 on Sunday,” airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic control) Santosh Kumar said on Tuesday.
 
 According to him, the new direct flights will provide connectivity to cities like Chandigarh, Indore, Ahmedabad and Guwahati. The cities currently having direct flights from Patna include Delhi, Kolkata, Ranchi and Bengaluru.
 
 Air India will be the first airline to operate flights from Patna at night hours. Sources said one of AI’s Ranchi-Patna flight will land at Patna at 11:40pm and depart for Kolkata around 7am.
 
 As of now, the city airport sees flight operations between 7am and 10pm. “The 24x7 flight operation is already approved. The required infrastructure is also available. It is now difficult to accommodate so many flights in daytime,” said airport director R S Lauharia.
 
 Two new aprons or parking bays are also being developed in front of the state hangar to allow more aircraft to be parked at the airport. The additional aprons are part of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) initiative to develop a new, swanky terminal building at the airport. 
 
 There are currently four aprons at the city airport, and the AAI plans to have ten aprons in the new terminal building.
 
 Work on the Rs 800-crore new terminal building will start in April this year. The two-storey building equipped with six aerobridges and other state-of-the-art facilities is expected to be ready in three years.
