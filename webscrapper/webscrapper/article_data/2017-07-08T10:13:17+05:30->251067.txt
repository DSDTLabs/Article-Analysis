AHMEDABAD: The   (GSSTB) has taken a long, circuitious route, to rectify what it says was an error, where the word ‘haivaan’, meaning demon, was used to describe Jesus in its Hindi (second language) textbook for class IX students of state board schools.

 Nitin Pethani, executive director of GSSTB, said they have issued a notification to DEOs, telling them to ensure that all schools through their Hindi teachers change ‘haivaan’ to ‘bhagwaan’ (God).   also said that the inquiry committee submitted a report holding the proof reader and content writer primarily responsible for the ‘error’ creeping into the textbook.
 
 GSSTB issued a clarification regarding the controversial ‘error’ in ‘Shikshan ane Parikshan’, a monthly magazine printed by the Gujarat state board, asking all schools to ensure that students are taught the sixteenth chapter of the textbook titled ‘Bharatiya sanskriti mein guru-shishya sambandh’ (the teacher-student relationship in Indian culture) only after the due corrections have been made. The clarification said the inclusion of the word ‘haivaan’ was a “typographical error” and there was no intention to hurt religious sentiments.
 
 This latest move comes after the mistake was been rectified in the online edition of the textbook. Officials say it is not possible to recall the textbooks and the mistake will be rectified in textbooks only next year.
 
 The principal of St Xavier’s Gandhinagar, Fr Fernand Durai, said, “The school received a circular and the teachers have done the needful. The students have been made to do the required correction.”
 
 Headmistress of  , Naranpura, Rashmi Trivedi, said, “The circular was published in the magazine and taking note of it, the class IX teachers have done the needful.”
 
 The principal of HBK School, Indrani Banerjee, said, “The circular is in the magazine which we received only on July 6. We will do the needful at the earliest.”
