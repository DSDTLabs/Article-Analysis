In February, while a wedding sequence was being filmed for the TV soap,  ,   Tandon and Jennifer Winget had to combat a fire on the set.

 Seven months later, while Kushal was gearing up for his reel life shaadi with  , another fire ravaged the Beyhadh set when the gathbandhan binding the two actors lit up during the pheras. 
 
  
  
 It was a second-time lucky escape for the actor, who was carrying his reel bride-to-be in his arms and quickly jumped to safety, joking, “I had nothing to do with starting this fire.” The shoot resumed after a while without any further delay.
 
 In the previous incident, the script had demanded that the mandap go up in flames, however, the fire went out of hand and couldn’t be contained. It resulted in some flaming props falling on the actors. Kushal suffered burns on his neck and legs, while Jennifer’s back was badly singed.
