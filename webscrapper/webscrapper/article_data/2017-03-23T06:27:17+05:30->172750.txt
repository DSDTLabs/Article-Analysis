MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday suspended   for nine months (till December 31, 2017) for creating a ruckus in the   and burning copies of the state budget in the   on Saturday.

 As soon as the Lower House assembled on Wednesday, parliamentary affairs minister Girish Bapat moved a proposal recommending suspension of 19 members (10 from NCP and 9 from Congress) including former minsters Vijay Wadettiwar, Bhaskar Jadhav and Jitendra Awhad. It was passed by a majority . Bapat also recommended that during the suspension period, these MLAs should not be allowed to enter the Mumbai and Nagpur assembly premises.
 
 Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil termed the suspension as injustice and boycotted legislative business by walking out of the House.“We were demanding announcement of a loan waiver for farmers in the budget, which is not unconstitutional, but the state government passed the proposal on the basis of its majority . The opposition will boycott legislative business until the state revokes the suspension,“ he said. The opposition also met Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao demanding revocation.
 
 The Shiv Sena members tooo opposed the suspension and met CM Devendra Fadnavis demanding revocation. While talking to the media, Bapat said the opposition had been making fun of the budget and the loan waiver issue, which was objectionable. “We too had opposed the government stand on issues when we were in opposi tion, but now opposition has burnt copies of the budget, which is not tolerable,“ he said.
 
 He claimed the suspension had nothing to do with the government's stability. “The government is stable. We are ready to face a no-trust motion if moved,“ he added.
 
 Speaker Haribhau Bagde clarified the Sena will be treated as a ruling party unless they hand over a letter to the governor about withdrawing support. Sena claimed it was against the suspension but did not support the MLAs' conduct.
