MUMBAI: An important proposal for the approval of the Rs 98,000 crore bullet train project was not taken up in Tuesday’s cabinet due to absence of   finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar.

 Chief Minister   told TOI that since the finance minister was not present, a high-level committee was set up to examine the proposal. A senior official claimed the proposal was deferred in view of doubts expressed by the finance department over the cost of the project. 
 
 “We are in the process of setting up a special purpose vehicle for the project. The proposal was brought before the cabinet, but then it was postponed for want of an in-depth study of the entire project. It will be brought before the next meeting of the cabinet,’’ he said. Under the proposal, out of the Rs 98,000 crore outlay, Rs 78,000 crore will be raised from financial institutions and Rs 20,000 crore from equity, 25% each from Maharashtra and Gujarat governments and remaining 50%from the central government. The bulk of the funding for the project will come in the way of the loan from Japan. The estimate includes possible cost escalation.
