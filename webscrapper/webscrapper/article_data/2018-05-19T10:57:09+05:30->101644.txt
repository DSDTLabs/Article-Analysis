Actress   said she got duped into buying a   home that turned out to be an unpleasant place. According to a report, the   claims  , who happens to manage actor  , was part of a seller group that convinced her to spend $3.2 million on a Malibu house in 2016, but had failed to mention it was riddled with major problems.

  
  
 According to the documents, Fox was pregnant at the time and was raising two toddlers. She was led to believe she was buying a "paradise in bucolic Malibu where she could raise her young family".
 
 Instead, Fox claims the home is a "nightmarish living hell". She said it's on a slope that needs to be regraded, and a bunch of features are not up to code - including animal pens, a gazebo, stone walls, and a storage building for livestock feed.
 
 According to the documents, there was also mold all over the house upon moving in, including in the master bedroom and bathroom and the children's rooms.
