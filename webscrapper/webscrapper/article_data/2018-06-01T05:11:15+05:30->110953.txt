NEW DELHI: With the Supreme Court insisting on a crack down on the circulation of   and online content depicting sexual assaults, the Centre has come up with a centralised portal and a helpline to receive complaints, besides developing a standard set of procedures to be followed to tamp down on the menace. 

 
 The ministry of home affairs on Thursday launched a centralised online portal www.cyberpolice.gov.in and helpline number ‘155260’ to receive complaints pertaining to child pornography and rape/gangrape (CP/RGR) content. 
 
 It wrote to all the states asking them to designate a nodal cyber cell, preferably in the state police headquarters, appoint nodal officers for handling complaints/content received online by June 15, investigate such complaints in time and immediately remove/block any child pornography/rape video content from the net.
 
 A draft standard operating procedure (SoP) was circulated to the states to deal with the CP/RGR complaints and content on the cyberpolice portal, where people can register complaints “anonymously” and upload the objectionable video/pictures etc for police action.
 
 According to the SOPs, the nodal officers who will handle child pornography/rape and gangrape content complaints have been asked to save all the evidence received from complainants in the system, and immediately issue notice (s) to content hosting providers (CHPs) and internet service providers (ISPs) for taking down the identified sexual abuse videos/photos or blocking the links/content.
 
 In a letter on Tuesday, the   informed the states all the complaints received on the cyberpolice portal will automatically get transferred to respective states/UTs cyber cell having jurisdiction to act on complaints expeditiously. The nodal officer appointed by the director general of police, will have jurisdiction all over the state and he can transfer the complaint to the concerned police station.
 
 It asked the states to operate this helpline in the nodal cyber cell itself.
 
 The cyberpolice portal,   officials told TOI, will also be connected with the crime and criminal tracking network systems (CCTNS) in which all 15,000 police stations across the country are connected.
