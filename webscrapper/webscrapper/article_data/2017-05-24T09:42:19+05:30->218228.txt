MUMBAI: With an aim to curb   from Mumbai, a non-government organisation (NGO) has announced an award and a holiday package for five policemen and their families. 

 The awards will be handed over to five policemen for giving up on tobacco by director general of police Satish Mathur on the occasion of World Tobacco Day on May 30. The awards and travel packages have been announced by the   (CPAA) and will be sponsored by Kesari tours. 
 
 Sources said that the holiday packages were for Kullu Manali and Jammu and Kashmir. The five policemen are constables Prahlad Madne from the RCF police station, Somnath Darade, Babu Thorat and  , all from the MRA Marg police station and Praveen Yadav from Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg police station. 
 
 "The NGO has taken an initiative to curb my habit of chewing tobacco. Last year, when I was on night patrolling duty I witnessed a man lying outside CST station with one side of his jaw fully damaged due to tobacco consumption. I then decided to quit tobacco, a habit that I had taken to when I was just eight or nine years old," said Madne. 
 
 Dilip Ugale, senior inspector of Kalachowky, said, "It is a very good initiative and with this, the percentage of   among policemen has fallen drastically. The government should bring a complete ban on tobacco."
 
 Anita Peter, executive director of CPAA, said that their awareness campaign among policemen for the last two years has yielded results. "The year 2017 has shown a 35% fall in the consumption of tobacco in the   force from 70% in two years," she said.
