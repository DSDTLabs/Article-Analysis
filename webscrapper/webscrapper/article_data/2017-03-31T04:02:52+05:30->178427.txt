New Delhi: The   ( ) administration on Thursday “increased” the number of seats for entry to MPhil/PhD programmes by 48, in certain schools like physical sciences and biotechnology.

 The student union, however, said this is not an increase in the number of seats but a rectification of former errors made while calculating the seats per school. The schools where seats have been added include   and Integrative Sciences, Special Centre for Nano Science and School of Physical Sciences. Professors said various schools have been holding meetings with the administration to add seats to their departments, which finally came through on Thursday. 
 
 However, president of the JNU Students Union Mohit Pandey said this increase is nothing but rectification of previous errors while calculating the number of seats. “Initially, the administration had made some mistake in calculating the seats for each school, and it has been corrected now. It is not really an increase in seats but a correction of an error,” he said.
 
 However, the teacher’s union said the seats that have been added will accept admission on the basis of junior research fellowship (JRF) entrance conducted by the UGC and CSIR.
