SHIMLA: In stark contrast to the Jallikatu uprising in Tamil Nadu, residents of the hill state fell in line despite reservations to the court order banning animal sacrifice in places of religious worship. A few residents did challenge the court order but there were no large-scale agitations. Those who opposed the move took legal recourse instead. 

 “In Himachal, people are not ready to part with the age old tradition of sacrificing animals to their deities but they fear holding protest demonstrations like in Tamil Nadu. Instead of holding protest demonstrations on roads we have taken legal route to address our issue,” said Dot Ram Thakur, president of Kullu Devi Devta Kardar Sangh. Thakur, along with Kullu royal Maheshwar Singh, moved court against the order. Maheshwar Singh is chief custodian of Lord   of Kullu.

Recently, an incident of animal sacrifice was reported from Diswani village of Shimla where a few people offered goats for sacrifice at the   temple on the occasion of Shand, (a local religious function).
