CHANDIGARH:   Anil Vij, who is not new to courting controversies, said on Wednesday that those supporting   student   were pro-Pakistan and should be thrown out of India. 

  "Those who are supporting Gurmehar are all pro-Pakistan. Such people have no right to live in India and they should be thrown out of the country," said the BJP minister. Reiterating his stand while talking to TOI, Vij said, "My statement refers to those political forces which use such children for their political gains," he said. "They shout about freedom of speech only when incidents like JNU violence occur. Such forces have no right to stay in the country." 
 
  The five-time MLA had embarrassed his own government in 2016 when he had accused the state CID of spying on him. In January this year, he had said that PM Narendra Modi was a better brand than Mahatma Gandhi for the promotion of khadi, but had later retracted his statement. 
 
  In contrast, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had on Tuesday come out in Kaur's defence, saying, "Kaur's a martyr's daughter and we should respect this fact. Those politicising the matter, what do they have to say about her father who was killed by terrorists?"
