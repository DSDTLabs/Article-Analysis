VIJAYAWADA: Finance minister   has said that the ratio of Centre-state contribution in national schemes should be 90:10. The states stand to lose if the Centre's contribution is 60 per cent and state's 10 per cent.

 The minister also though the Centre was supposed to release Rs 7,000 crore in 2014-15 to fill the   gap in 2014-2015 financial year, only about Rs 3,000 crore was released till date. Though the minister expressed the hope that funds would come by the end of February, many in the state are very keen that in this budget, the Union government's contention is that only Rs 138 crore is pending. The Centre has taken into account funds released for pension and other schemes implemented by the state government.
 
 According to TDP insiders, the budget allocation may set the tone for the future equations. â€œChief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is not really keen on having the promises delivered. His concern is only what the state gets from the Centre, nothing else," said a source in the party," said a source in the party. 
 
 Curiouly, just before the budget, BJP national president Amit Shah reportedly called the BJP state leaders the discuss politics in the state. However, it is not clear as to what the agenda of the meeting was. Only a few leaders were invited to it.
 
 Meanwhile, speaking to reporters in New Delhi, cabinet minister   said that TDP is hoping for a favourble decision on Visakhapatbam railway zone and a decision will be announced soon. He also said that NABARD will soon release funds for externally-aided projects. He said the delimitation of constituencies needs an amedment to the Constitution.
