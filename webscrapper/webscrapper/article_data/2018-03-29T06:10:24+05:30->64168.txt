KOLKATA: As part of the ongoing initiative to remove encroachments from the pavements in  , the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation on Wednesday carried out another eviction drive with the help of the police in the   area.

 Around 50 hawkers — who had been doing business on the pavements between   and Baishakhi bazar — were evicted in presence of a huge police force.
 
 The hawkers mostly sold vegetables and operated roadside eateries. There were also a few fruit and tea stalls. The police presence prevented any spot demonstration and the evicted hawkers went to the   to meet the civic authorities to air their grievances.
 
 Civic authorities said that the encroachers had earlier been served notice to move out, but failed to do so. Local residents welcomed the eviction drive, saying the encroachers also used to occupy some part of the main road in front of the pavement.
 
 “We had been doing business here for years and this was our only income. What will we do now? Where we will go?” asked Tulu Saha, one of those evicted.
 
 “With the population and number of vehicles increasing in Salt Lake, the township needs to have clean roads and footpaths. We support the civic authority’s initiative,” said   secretary  .
 
 The civic authorities had started the eviction drives in Salt Lake last year to clean up the pavements before the U17 Fifa world cup. Hawkers were removed from the Broadway stretch and also from the area around Salt Lake stadium. However, the major eviction drive was carried out at   last December, in which seven illegal structures on the pavements and an abandoned ward office were razed.
 
 Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation mayor   had said the civic body will keep up constant monitoring to ensure no new encroachment takes place on the pavements. A section of hawkers who had been evicted has been rehabilitated in other places.
