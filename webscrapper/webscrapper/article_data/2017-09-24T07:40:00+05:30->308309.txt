Ludhiana: A few years ago, Ram Leela fairs were the highlight of the festival season. But slowly, the much-awaited event has lost much of its audience as well as its artists. Few Dussehra committees are organising Ram Leela. Also, those who organise the event take the help of Ramanand Sagarâ€™s Ramayana serial telecast on DD National in the 80s. 

 The Ram Leela and Dussehra fairs at Daresi are the oldest in the city. Artists came this year but the management got LED screen installed where Ramayana CDs will be played. Committee member Sanjeev Kundra said artists will perform their roles in the Ram Leela from Thursday night but the CD will also be played because it was hugely popular. 
 
 President, Ram Leela and Dussehra committee of Rajguru Nagar Brij Mohan Kalia said they organise Ram Leela every year but use recorded dialogues of Ramayana for public convenience while artists only act. He said they do it to prevent language understanding problems. 
 
 Nav Dugra Mandir Trust, Sarabha Nagar member Anil Bassi also said Ram Leela is staged every year and around 4,000 to 5,000 families come to watch the artists, who come from Vrindavan. But he said they also use recorded dialogues of Ramayana. 
 
 The Upkar Nagar Dussehra committee does not organise Ram Leela but have installed LED screen on the ground to screen the serial. Charanjit Singh of Upkar Nagar Dussehra Committee said that they will screen Ramayana on the big screen for public entertainment.
