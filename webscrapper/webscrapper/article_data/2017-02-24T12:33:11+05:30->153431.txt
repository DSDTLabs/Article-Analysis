Actress   has pledged USD 50,000 to an organisation helping the gay and transgender community following US President  's decision to withdraw protections regarding school bathroom laws.
 
  
 
  
  The "Girls" creator and star was among the outraged celebrities who took aim at Trump, when it was announced government officials had removed the federal guidelines that allowed transgender school students to use the bathrooms that matched their gender identity.
  
  The move is aimed at giving state authorities more control over the matter, but many critics insist the change to the laws, originally introduced by former leader President Barack Obama, will leave members of the LGBTQ community at risk from discrimination.
  
  Dunham has been a longtime supporter of LGBTQ causes.
  
  "Let's fight hate & ignorance with love for trans teens, who are already facing steep odds and who need our support to grow and THRIVE," Dunham wrote on Twitter.
  
  "I'm matching all donations up to 50k to the Ruth Ellis Center... Tweet me your donation receipt!," she added.
  
  The 30-year-old is not the only celebrity upset about President Trump's decision - opera singer Jackie Evancho, who performed at the his inauguration last month, took to Twitter to reach out to Trump in an effort to land a meeting with the Republican, at which she hopes to discuss the discrimination faced by transgender people, like her sister Juliet.
  
  Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson also slammed President Trump, writing on Twitter, "This is disgusting. This is unacceptable.
