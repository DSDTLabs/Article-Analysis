HYDERABAD: The Ganesh Chaturthi festival is a good four months away but confusion over the famed   if it will be made of clay or plaster of paris (PoP) is already spilling over. The   is on the horns of a dilemma: Whether to go by governor ESL  's advice of having a clay idol or follow the 63-year-old tradition of a PoP idol. 

 The utsav committee's hesitation this year could be directly attributed to the governor's advice to make the Ganesha idol with clay and natural colours instead of using PoP as a part of promoting eco-friendly Ganeshas. The 'bhoomi pooja' (known as karra pooja) will be held at   on May 25. "The pooja is a decades old tradition which we have been following and the idol preparation itself takes four months," secretary of Ganesh utsav committee S Sudarshan told TOI. 
 
 Ganesh Chaturthi falls on September 13. "A week before the festival, we will have to complete the works on the tallest idol in the city," he said. He went on to claim that the height of the idol would be restricted to 56 ft. Last year, citizens were treated to a 57ft tall idol. "As per the decision of the utsav committee to reduce the height of the idol by 1ft every year, we are bringing down the height this year as well," he said.
 
 But, the bigger puzzle staring before the committee is over how to make the Ganesha idol. "If we prepare the idol using only clay, the heavy rain could be play a spoilsport. The idol could just disintegrate and it will be very difficult for us to cover the tallest idol with a plastic cover," a member of the committee said. 
 
 At the same time, the committee cannot wish away the concerns of environmental activists and the governor as chorus for clay idols is growing year after year. "We will meet the governor soon and explain to him on the advantages and disadvantages of using clay and PoP. The committee will take a call only after talking to the governor," a senior member said.
