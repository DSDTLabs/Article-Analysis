 A farmer Kevalsinh Rathod said, “We have all the valid documents to show that we are farming this land. We have also got loan from the bank and cooperative society.”
 
 The farmers had organized rally in July 2017 in Una demanding that their land records be regularized. At that time, the farmers had got a written assurance from the deputy collector. However, farmers allege that till date no procedure has started. Of the 32 farmers on hunger strike, at least five were admitted to hospital on Sunday after they fell sick.
