NEW DELHI: Dashing all hopes of seeing   reinstated at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the Games federation was categorical that it would not rescind on the issue, and that its stand was final and binding on all participating nations. Paying little heed to concerns raised by shooters worldwide, the   Federation (CGF) informed that the status of shooting was an “optional sport” after a decision in this regard was made during the 2015 CGF general assembly and later in 2016 when the new CGF constitution was approved.

 
 In a letter to the Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) issued recently, CGF CEO   has said the decision wasn’t solely taken by the CGF, but the “entire commonwealth of nations” after considering all other optional sports carefully. “Shooting will not feature at the 2022 CWG and the CGF has awarded the Games supporting these plans,” Grevemberg wrote Birmingham Games’ Organising Committee (OC) has chosen table tennis, judo, gymnastics, wrestling, cycling, diving and 3X3 basketball as the seven optional sports.
 
 “Birmingham is a diverse and dynamic city that has proposed an inspiring and inclusive event for 2022, and in record time. We know that they considered all optional sports carefully, but a final decision was reached,” added Grevemberg.
 
 Grevemberg’s statement meant that the efforts mounted by the Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF), National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) and Union sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore to get shooting back into the CWG fold didn’t cut ice with the CGF. Without naming India, Grevemberg stated that CGF understands the disappointment of excluding shooting when “a particular country has enjoyed medal success in this sport historically”.
