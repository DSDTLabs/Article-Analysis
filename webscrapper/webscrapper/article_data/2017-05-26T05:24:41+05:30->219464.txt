THISSUR: The safety of women students of Government  , Thrissur is in question following a recent   post of a student of the institution. According to the post, which is being widely shared on social media, a stranger intruded into the accommodation facility provided for women house surgeons and PG students at the college a week ago.

 “…In the semi darkness, I have seen a hazy figure aged nearly 20 in his shorts... I screamed my hell out, my friends woke up and came for my rescue. The intruder romped out before we could identify his face” (sic) reads the post by  , who is currently pursuing house surgency. 
 
 Though the matter was taken up to the authorities concerned, the response was cold, said Christina, adding that they do not lock rooms from inside as the duty timings of the house surgeons differ and they are summoned to casualty anytime when required.
 
  Dr  , state secretary of Kerala Medical Postgraduates Association (KMPGA), said, “The authorities react only when something extreme happens. As a temporary solution, it has been decided to close all entrances and restrict entry to doctors and staff only as the mess is also located on the same floor.” Also, it was decided to put in place grill with locks at the entrances, he added, towards which the house surgeons association, PG association, the present house surgeons’ batch and the PTA have decided to contribute. 
 
 Meanwhile, college principal Dr Ajayakumar said a team, including the superintendent, had visited the accommodation and necessary steps have been taken to ensure security. “Works like fixing the grill have to be done by the PWD and requires lengthy procedures. But now we have to do this on an emergency basis. That is why the amount for the same has to be raised from students along with PTA fund,” he said. 
 
 “New quarters for PG students and house surgeons are under construction. We will be able to shift to the new facility in a year or two,” he added.
