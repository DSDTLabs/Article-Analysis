CHENNAI: Political parties in the state including the DMK and PMK on Tuesday slammed the state government's appointment of chief electoral officer   as managing director of   as additional charge and demanded that the order be revoked. The DMK urged chief election commissioner  , governor   and chief secretary   to restore the individuality of the constitutional functions of the CEO. 

 TOI had published a report on Tuesday "No full-time chiefs for water agencies," on the appointment of Sahoo in the water agency. In an order issued last Thursday, chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan said Sahoo would hold the post for three months, without detailing the reasons. 
 
 This triggered a controversy in the bureaucracy as experienced hands are available to handle water supply.
 
 "Even with the consent of the commission, no chief electoral officer of a state should be posted with additional charge of any department or any state-controlled undertaking," DMK MP R S Bharathi said in complaint to the CEC, governor and chief secretary. 
 
 The DMK demanded that the officer be allowed to function independently without any additional charge, as it would denude the exclusive powers and duties of the CEO of the state.
 
 PMK leader   said the move could not be justified as it would ruin the credibility of the post. 
 
 "The CEO should act in an unbiased manner, earning the confidence of political parties. This will lead to the elections conducted by Sahoo coming under suspicion. The commission has to remove him from the additional post or appoint an officer with impeccable integrity as chief electoral officer," the PMK leader said, adding that there was a deliberate attempt to suggest that there was no eligible officer in the TN cadre to helm Metrowater.
