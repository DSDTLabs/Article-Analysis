JAIPUR: The Public Relations and Allied Services Association of Rajasthan (Prasar) has threatened that if the issues that it has repeatedly raised in petitions to the director, chief secretary and chief minister go unaddressed, they will be forced to resort to  . In a press release on Sunday, the association said that no fresh recruitments have occurred in nearly four years. No promotion too has occurred, and several positions are vacant. This has affected smooth functioning of the department.

 Sitaram Meena, president of the association, told TOI, “We have been appealing to the chief secretary and the chief minister. We had decided to protest at the time of the assembly session, but were assured that our demands would soon be addressed. We had called off our protest at that time, taking seriously assurances we were given. Now, there is no further action on those promises.”
 
 In its press note, the association protested the proposal to hand over the information centre at the heart of the city to the IT department for a proposed “IT Funcity”. Meena told TOI, “Such decisions are taken without deliberation. There was no dialogue ahead of the decision. We were left in the dark. We already struggle with poor infrastructure and inadequate staff. Handing over the premises will come as another blow.”
