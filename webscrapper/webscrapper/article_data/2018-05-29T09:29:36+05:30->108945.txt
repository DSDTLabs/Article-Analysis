IMPHAL: Convener of the People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance ( ), Erendro Leichombam, refused to seek bail and take down a 'hate video' from his   profile on Monday. Erendro, who was picked up from his Thangmeiband residence in   on Saturday for sharing the video, was remanded by an Imphal court to judicial custody for 15 days on Monday. 

 The video in question, which contains inflammatory speeches made by some suspected Biharis against Manipuris, had earlier gone viral on social networking sites.   had picked up some persons for circulating the video and issued warning to internet users not to circulate it, citing that it might lead to racial violence. In his Facebook post, Erendro termed the police action as 'fake warning', and questioned the police for their failure in tracking down those who had actually made the video.
 
 Erendro's arrest sparked a huge public protest, with a large number of Thangmeiband womenfolk and his supporters demanding his unconditional release. On Monday morning, Erendro and six others arrested for sharing the video were produced before the chief judicial magistrate (Imphal West). While the other six were granted bail by the court, Erendro refused to furnish his bail bond. 
 
 Speaking outside the court complex after the hearing, Erendro said, "I want justice and will stay in jail hundred and two hundred times for justice and my motherland. I will not apply for bail. I want to be released unconditionally. This government is gagging people."
 
 "Those who made the video are walking free while those who shared the video have been arrested. This is gross injustice. The   government in Manipur is shameful," Erendro added, amid loud chants of 'Free Erendro' outside the court complex.
 
 Police have charged Erendro under sections 153-A, 153-B, 505, 506 and 511 of the IPC and 84-C IT Act for promoting enmity between different groups and criminal intimidation.
