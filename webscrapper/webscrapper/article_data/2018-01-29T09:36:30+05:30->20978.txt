 Offices in   division will attend the adalat on Wednesday.
 
 KWA sources said that around 500 connections belonging to around 50 departments were served notices. "However, the departments which attend the adalat will be allowed to pay through one time settlement, where they will be given concessions," said an official.
 
 "  tops the list of defaulters with pending dues of nearly Rs 14 crore. Despite repeated notices, some departments, like the Medical College, have refused to replace their non-working meter, causing huge loss for the KWA," said an official.
 
 University College, Government Sanskrit College and tourism department are some of the defaulters.
 
 KWA MD A   said, "Since these are government institutions, we are not taking steps to disconnect the supply. If the adalat fails to collect the dues, I am planning to conduct an adalat at MD-level. Supply shall be disconnected only as the last measure," Shainamol said.
