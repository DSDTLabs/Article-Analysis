How amicable it will be when we sit back and listen to music tracks without any interruptions in between.   has launched a 24*7 live   channel where you can now listen to your favourite songs all day playing song after song without ad breaks. 

 As the channel streams only audio, the music can be enjoyed without consuming heavy data. 3G connection is preferred but 2G network as well can be used with 144p resolution streams songs at highest possible audio quality.
 
 The channel also features live public chats, where listeners can interact with each other while listening to the station and even request for songs.
