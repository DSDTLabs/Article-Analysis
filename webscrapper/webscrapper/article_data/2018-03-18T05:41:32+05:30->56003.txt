MUMBAI: Another young woman was robbed off her cellphone inside the ladies coach of a local at   last week. She said she alerted cops present at the next station, Khar, but they said they couldn't do anything as the thief had fled. 

  After reading TOI's report on the arrest of a serial mobile phone thief operating on  , the woman lodged a complaint with the Bandra GRP on Saturday.
 
 Shikha Rajput, 24, works with an American entertainment company and lives with her aunt at Dadar. On March 9, she had gone to Malad for some official work and boarded a Churchgate-bound local which reached Santa Cruz at 10.30pm. "I had boarded the last second-class ladies coach, next to the motorman's cabin. I was standing in the passage, listening to music on my phone. There weren't many women in the compartment," said Rajput.
 
  As the train started, a man, wearing a cap, entered the compartment and snatched her phone. "I resisted but he pulled hard and left scratches on my arms. Within seconds, he jumped onto the tracks from the other exit and crossed the boundary wall to leave the railway premises. I was stunned. It happened so soon that the other commuters couldn't even react. Had I held on to the phone, he would have dragged me," she said. 
 
 The cap prevented Rajput from getting a good look at his face. He also kept his head lowered, probably aware CCTVs at the platform would capture him. "The cops at Khar station told me to approach Bandra GRP outpost. Seeing their response, I wondered if the thief would ever be caught and, hence, I did not press charges. But after reading about Halim Shaikh's arrest, I decided to lodge a complaint," she said. A senior officer confirmed an FIR had been recorded and said they would view CCTV footage from the station.
