HYDERABAD: Reaching late to the   ( )   centre has cost dearly to students as many of them were not allowed to enter the examination hall after the   on Sunday. 

 Gates at most centres closed sharp at 9.30am and no excuses were entertained after that.
 
 "The exam was scheduled to begin at 10am and I reached the centre by 9.45 am. I didn't realise that the reporting time was 9.30am. Because of this mistake, I have lost one precious year," said teary-eyed Rajeshwari, who was supposed to write her exam at  , Bowenpally. Bystanders at the centre said that the officials tried to help her, but nothing could be done as the system stopped accepting students after 9.30am.
 
 "The girl was dropped by one of her relatives at the examination center and she had no money even to go back to her place. The parents present at the centre pooled money and sent her home after it was confirmed that she wouldn't be allowed to write the exam," said a parent at the centre.
 
 Many students, who came to the exam centre wearing barred ornaments like rings, earrings, nose-pins, chains/necklaces, pendants and badges were asked to remove them before entering. Candidates who came to the centre wearing shoes were asked to write the exam barefoot.
