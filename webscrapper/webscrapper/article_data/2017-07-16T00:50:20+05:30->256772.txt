KOLKATA:   is likely to come up at Chinsurah with education minister   and Hooghly DM   earmarking 10-15acres for the ambitious project and forwarding the report to chief minister   on Friday.

  “The DM has inspected the locality and the report has been forwarded to the CM. If she gives a go-ahead then we shall proceed with the plan,” Chatterjee said.
 
 The green university is likely to start admissions only from the 2019-2020 academic session and will offer courses from post-graduation and above.
 
 It will be a unitary and non-affiliating university that will only teach courses related to envi-ronment, green technology, and agriculture. 
 
 “The green university will also follow a sustainable development and use various conservation methods,” said a source in the higher education department. After a few more inspections, a detailed project report will be ready and a bill will then be tabled in the state assembly.
 
 “We may install solar panels to reduce the burden on the power grid. Rainwater harvesting will be carried out and water meters are to be put in place. Reduction of carbon footprint will be the main aim,” explained a source.
 
 The green university will also put a complete ban on use of plastic on campus, as well as implement no-smoking and no-littering rules. The generated waste will be recycled to produce energy. “We also need to see how carbon emission from vehicles plying on campus can be controlled. The campus will also have eco-friendly lighting,”a senior official added.
