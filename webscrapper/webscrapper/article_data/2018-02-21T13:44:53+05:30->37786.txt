 is a very scoring and easy subject, mainly because it is our mother tongue and we are well acquainted with it. I insist that you should be thorough with the state board textbook, know the lessons well and do in-depth study of it so that when a question from the same pops up, you should be in a position to give a detailed answer and use your creativity.

 When you are asked to write a long answer in comprehension, always start with ‘sandarbh’, mention the writer’s name and give a short description about the storyline. This will reflect your subject knowledge, impress the examiner and get you brownie points.
 
 There are 99% chances that the questions will be asked from behind the chapters, so make sure you go through them. The essay would revolve around five sub-categories which are autobiography, imaginary, scientific, experiential, and expansion of idea about a quote or personality. From this, I would recommend you to choose autobiography as you won’t have to worry about facts and you can let your thoughts flow and draft them as per your will.
 
 Systematically start the body with an introduction followed by key information and conclusion. Try to solve the paper in a sequential manner. There is no need to waste time in using a separate pencil to underline; simply stick to a single pen throughout the answer sheet.
 
 There would be a choice between letter and advertisement, and I suggest you to go for the former as it includes step-wise marking like mathematics. But don’t forget to sum it up by drawing an envelope.
 
 In the rapid reading section, you will be asked to write either two short notes or one summary. The probability of scoring high will increase if you go for short notes as your marks will be divided in it, whereas entailing all the details in a single summary could be challenging.
