MUZAFFARNAGAR: A 75-year-old woman named Ashiya was allegedly beaten to death by the owner of a fair price shop when she protested against him for denying her ration. 

 The incident was reported from   village in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district on Friday afternoon. Riyaz Ahmed, the victim's son, told TOI, "She went to buy monthly ration from  's shop. However, when she arrived there, Shameem refused to give her any ration. When she protested against him, he and his two brothers, Janu and  , started beating her. She fell unconscious and was taken to the nearest hospital, but was declared brought dead." 
 
 Police said that the three accused have been booked under IPC's section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). "They are currently on the run but we will arrest them soon," circle officer Mohammed Rizwan said.
 
 According to an eyewitness, after being beaten, the elderly woman was pushed and her head hit the wall.
 
 Mohammed Babu, the victim's son-in-law, said that earlier too, Shameem had misbehaved with her, but she did not say anything. "He generally misbehaves with his customers and is an arrogant and ill-tempered man. It is shocking that he did not even spare an elderly woman. He and his brothers should get strict punishment." 
 
 Meanwhile, sub-divisional magistrate   said that she has come to know about the incident and instructed the district supply officer to investigate the case and submit a report at the earliest. 
 
 "Strict action will be taken against the accused," she said. Soon after the incident, local residents held a protest and refused to hand over the woman's body to police. After several assurances from the cops, they finally relented and the body was sent for postmortem.
