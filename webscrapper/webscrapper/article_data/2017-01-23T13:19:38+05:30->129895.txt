VISAKHAPATNAM: What caused the   to derail? This question continued to   and their relatives even as officials remained tightlipped on the exact cause of mishap. The silence of officials has only fuelled the theory that sabotage may have caused the mishap.

 Waltair divisional railway manager   said, “I’m deeply saddened by this terrible accident which resulted in such great loss of life. The fact that this had to happen in my division saddens me even more.” Kuneru, where the mishap occurred, is situated in Komarada mandal. It is 10 km away from the Andhra-Odisha border (AOB), a hotbed of Maoist movement. However, she maintained that the reason for the accident is still unclear.
 
 Local railway union leaders said human or technical error cannot be blamed for the accident. They alleged that the staff especially in the safety related wings are extremely overburdened. A union leader, who did not wish to be named, said, “How can the staff be blamed for negligence, when the division including all departments is short of 4,000 personnel. The total manpower required to man the division is 21,700. There 4,000 vacant posts. The situation in the safety related wings such as telecommunications, signalling, and line maintenance is bad. One-fourth of the sanctioned strength is vacant. About 28 per cent of driver posts are vacant.
 
 He said the entire division especially Group C and Group D are grossly under staffed. However, only seven percent of senior posts are vacant.
 
 Refuting the allegation Mukherjee observed, “This is something that is true in all government sectors. It is common across the railways in the country. However, this cannot be the reason for the accident.”
 
 Railway authorities are quite unwilling to take direct responsibility for the mishap. The Maoists or any other terror group has so far claimed responsibility for the incident.
