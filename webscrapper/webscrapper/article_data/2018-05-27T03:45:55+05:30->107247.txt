GANDHINAGAR: On May 26, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government completed four years in power, the political circles of Gujarat witnessed a war of words. While   started its fortnight-long celebration of the four years of the Modi government, Congress staged protests at all district headquarters and called the day ‘Vishwasghat Din’ (betrayal day).

 Gujarat BJP chief said, “We congratulate PM Modi for honest and transparent government. The Congress era was one of ‘policy paralysis’. Youth, women, farmers, tribals, poor, urban citizens were suffering under the most corrupt government led by the Congress..”
 
 After holding protests and calling the day ‘Vishwasghat Din’ (betrayal day) Gujarat Congress president   said, “In the last four years, the PM Modi-led BJP government has done nothing except betray the people. The prices of all commodities have increased and petrol is really hurting people’s pockets.”
