GAYA: The death of   (34) and his wife   (30) at Ishwarpur under the   area of the district on Thursday remained shrouded in mystery as police have registered a   on the basis of a written complaint by Bablu’s father on Friday.
 
  Their bodies were recovered from two separate rooms of their house. According to ASP Balram Chaudhary, the complainant stated in the FIR that the couple had a fight, but also said some unknown persons might have killed his son and daughter-in-law.
  
  The FSL report was awaited. Earlier, the six-year-old son of the couple told the police that his parents did have a fierce fight over some domestic issue. The woman, as her son told the police, threw a sharp-edged kitchen appliance that hit his father in the neck and he died. His mother, subsequently, slit her own throat with the same kitchen appliance, the boy is learnt to have told the police.
  
  However, it’s difficult for the police to digest the boy’s version as instant death caused by a kitchen appliance thrown from some distance was highly unlikely. Moreover, slitting one’s own throat with the help of a kitchen appliance is also not common.
  
  To make the incident more complicated, the house, as per reports, was bolted from inside and there was no apparent evidence of forced entry.
