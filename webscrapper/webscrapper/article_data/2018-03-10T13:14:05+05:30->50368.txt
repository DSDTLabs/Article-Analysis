CHANDIGARH: Just one   might be behind all recent incidents where people were duped outside and inside banks, says the team investigating into the crimes.

 This gang promises its targets a big cut if they agree to adjust its unaccounted money into their accounts. After the targets fall for this money-exchange deal, the gang switches real notes with paper. In dozens of such cases been reported in the past two years, police have failed to make much headway. 
  
 
 Since January 2016, 14 such   cases have been reported in the city, all having taken place right outside or inside   branches. According to senior police officers, they have leads that in all such cases one gang is involved. “Based on the victim’s statements and the method used in all cases, we believe it’s the same gang,” said a senior police officer.
 
 He added that the gang members would be arrested soon.
 
 Cops said the gang also targetted people who looked poor and uneducated. First, the gang members befriend their target. They then lure the person by offering him or her a share in the stolen money. In other cases, they request people to help them deposit their money as they don’t have a bank account. 
 
 In some cases, accused duped gullible people on pretext of helping them fill cash-deposit forms at banks. 
 
 Police officials said in maximum cases the accused committed the crime away from the range of CCTV cameras. 
 
 “That is why we failed to get the pictures of accused,” said an officer. In other cases, accused hide their faces in the bank, so that they cannot be identified easily after the crime. However, police said they are now in posession of CCTV grabs showing photos of the accused clearly and had deputed cops in civils to nab the accused.
