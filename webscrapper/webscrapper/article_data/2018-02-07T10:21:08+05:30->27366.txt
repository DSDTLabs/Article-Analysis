NAGPUR: Unable to accept a ‘no’ for marriage proposal, 24-year-old Sandeep   dramatically ended his life at his female friend’s residence at   on Monday. 

 Police said Bawne’s female friend, who is undergoing training of air-hostess at a private institution, was being harassed by the victim for the last two months. Though they had been ‘friends’ for last couple of years after coming to know each other through a common friend, it was in the last two months that Bawne had been persistently pressing her to say ‘yes’ to his marriage proposal. Bawne worked for a MIDC-based private company.
 
 The over zealous Bawne’s relentless pursuing the female friend had also led to a rift in their relation. She had started distancing herself from him. The female friend had also ‘blocked’ Bawne’s calls and messages too in her cell phone.
 
 Police said Bawne had gone to meet the female friend when she was alone at her home. The girl’s parents had gone for work. Bawne had a chat with the girl at the drawing room before he followed to another room while desperately trying to make her accept his proposal. As the young woman kept saying no, a desperate Bawne took out a bottle having pesticide in it and offered it to her. As she declined, Bawne moved to the kitchen consumed it. 
 
 As Bawne started frothing from mouth, the girl alerted her friends before trying to revive him. She also ensured raising an alarm in the neighbourhood. Later, the woman called up the police control room which directed the MIDC cops to reach the place. The cops shifted Bawne to   where the doctors declared him dead before admission. 
 
 MIDC police said there was no suicide note found in Bawne’s possession. A case of accidental death has been registered at MIDC police station.
