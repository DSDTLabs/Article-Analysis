Sauber’s   will not start tomorrow’s season-opening Australian Grand Prix, after discovering his fitness was not up to a full race distance.

 The German-Mauritian suffered from back problems following January’s   event in Miami, where he had a dramatic crash with fellow   driver   – in which his car flipped before spearing into the barriers.
 
 Wehrlein has since recovered from his injuries, but the long delay in upping his fitness for F1’s new, faster and more physically challenging cars has meant that he arrived in Melbourne under prepared.
 
 The 22-year-old was cleared to race on Thursday, but a team spokesman said he went to the team on Friday night, following two practice sessions, and was open and honest about his issue.
 
 “The injury is totally fine, so I got cleared from the doctors, from the FIA, I’ve got no pain at all. I was also driving two weeks ago in Barcelona. The back is 100 per cent fine, and that’s the most important thing,” Wehrlein said.
 
 “But, of course, a back injury nine weeks before the first race takes you a step backwards in terms of fitness, and that’s what I felt yesterday, especially in the long run. 
 
 “I feel like I’m good to drive the car, but I’m feeling for the whole race distance, I’m not fit enough to perform at my best level.
 
  team principal   was supportive of the young gun.
 
 “We have great respect of Pascal’s openness and professionalism,” she said.
 
 “This decision was definitely not an easy one for him, it underlines his qualities as a team player. The focus is now on his fitness level, and in such a situation we do not take any unnecessary risks. Pascal will be in China as planned.”
 
 Ferrari reserve driver  , runner-up in last year’s GP2 Series, will replace Wehrlein – and make his F1 debut.
