According to the police, harassment by Tinku led the family to get into a suicide pact.
 
 "Upon perusal of material on record, this court is of the opinion that to attract the offence under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide), the accused ought to have necessarily committed an act which would connote his complicity in the commission of suicide of the victim," said Justice Jadhav. 
 
 "In the absence of any nexus between a cause and object, prima facie, no presumption could be drawn that Tinku was responsible for the suicidal death (of the family). It is in these circumstances that this court is of the opinion that he deserves to be enlarged on bail," the judge said, while pointing out that Tinku had been in jail since his arrest in February 2015. Tinku's sister was also booked, but she obtained pre-arrest bail. Tinku's lawyers said that the evidence collected by the police does not reveal that there was any immediate cause that led the family to commit suicide.
