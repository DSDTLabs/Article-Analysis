She sat under the   in her ancestral house while she tried to express herself through her words, and as the world read her books, the tree became synonymous with Madhavikutty’s quest and passion for life.

 On her fourth death anniversary in 2013, as a tribute to the iconoclastic feminist writer, a group of women including writers and media professionals, by the name  , planted a sapling of the tree at the Manaveeyam Veedhi, Thiruvananthapuram. And it grew along with the next generation of readers who too lapped up Madhavi kutti’s verses.
 
 Five years down the lane, the women are rejoicing. Reason? It bloomed for the first time last Friday. According to them, the four flowers in one of its top branches is nothing less than a dream come true. “It was a day after we commemorated the death of the eight-year old Kathua rape victim. When our   bore its first flowers, we felt as if it was the tree’s (her) tears for the victim,” says Geetha Nazeer, a senior journalist who is part of the group.
 
 The flowering tree was planted by poet   by reading the lines from her masterpiece ' ' and wishing that her works live forever. “Sadly, the writer did not have any memorial even in her homeland though she is a renowned literary figure. To see the flower was enlightening, as many of us are only familiar with it through her writing,” says Geetha.
 
 Every third Friday, the women collective meets at Manaveeyam Veedhi and pursue their artistic and literary endeavours. “We have named our meeting as Idam (space) and and the Neermathalam has been a silent witness of our programmes. We celebrated her first birthday by adorning her with ribbons, putting bangles on her branches and distributing payasam to passersby. The tree that survived hard summers and pest attacks is an inspiration to every woman,” concludes Geetha.
