NAGPUR: State PWD authorities came under fire from high court here on Monday, for failure to remove encroachments from   and Hospital (IGGMC) even after earlier orders. The then division bench led by Justice Bhushan Gavai had asked the authorities to clear encroachments from the area on January 13 last year.

 It was pointed out by amicus curiae   that nothing has moved at IGGMC since then as authorities, including   (NMC), failed to comply with orders. A division bench of Justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi then asked the PWD and NMC to reply when it would be razing the illegal structures on IGGMC premises and also explain reasons for the delay.
 
 The directives came while hearing a contempt petition (CP No 281/2017) in a writ petition (No 3427/2000) filed by CH Sharma and others regarding lack of facilities in government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCHs) across Vidarbha.
 
 Earlier, the government pleader informed government had released funds required for purchasing equipment for Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) and would soon be floating tenders. An officer on special duty (OSD), P Patil, was also appointed on SSH. It was further informed that the new operation theatre at IGGMC was almost ready with only power connection left to be operationalized.
 
 In the last hearing, the court had asked the government why contempt action shouldn’t be taken against it for not appointing regular dean, despite giving an undertaking.
 
 IGGMC’s 250-bed hospital, which was solely functioning due to HC’s intervention, needs about 157 staff and despite repeated directives only 80 have been recruited on contract. The amicus contended the college may again face problems in getting recognition for its seats from Medical Council of India (MCI). He also invited attention to absence of air conditioning in pre and post-operational theatres and non-procurement of equipment/appliances for SSH though sufficient funds were made available in October.
