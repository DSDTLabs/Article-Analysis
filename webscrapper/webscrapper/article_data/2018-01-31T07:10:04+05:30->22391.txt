HYDERABAD: The   (GHMC) might have announced a war against the use of plastic bags, but the rampant use of polythene bags at the ongoing 78
   , popularly known as Numaish, in   tells an entirely different story.

 At the annual trade fair, which has been going on for a month now, several stalls have been handing over items to customers in plastic bags. Even visitors to the fair are cheerfully seen walking around with goods in polythene covers.
 
 It must be recalled that plastic bags of less than 50 microns were banned in the city in June 2016 for being non-biodegradable and leading to pollution. But the ban seems to be on paper.
 
 When TOI spoke to a few stall owners at the exhibition, many remained casual about the ban, while others shifted the onus on the officials for not checking the usage. “Every stall owner is using plastic bags, so why can’t we,” said  , a handloom stall owner from Rajasthan.
 
 While some shoppers shifted the blame to the stall owners for giving them items in polythene covers, the ones carrying the bags questioned the efforts of the government for discouraging its use. “On one hand, GHMC is carrying out awareness drive and on the other hand you have this fair where plastics bags are being openly used. Why is government not doing anything about it?” quipped  , one of the visitors to the fair.
 
 GHMC has been conducting several inspections and acting tough against business establishments using plastic carrying bags. In addition to imposing fines, focus is on chicken and mutton shops to discourage usage of polythene carry bags.
