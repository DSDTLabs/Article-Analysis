Nagpur: Decks are cleared for   pollution abatement project of Rs1,252.33 crore. On July 25, the state government had approved to give 25% and also to take guarantee of NMC’s share of 15% of the project cost. The centre had approved 60% share. 

 Centre and state will take loan from Japan-based Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and give it to the NMC as grant.
 
 The project will end the pollution problem of the river. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) would be set up at regular intervals along the river and the treated water will be released in the river.
 
 The NMC is preparing detailed project report for another proposal — Nag riverfront development plan of Rs1,373.60 crore — and will submit to the state and Centre in the coming days for approval.
 
 The river will be totally rejuvenated once these two projects are completed.
 
 Also, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had approved a third plan of Rs618 crore under AMRUT. Under this project, Pora river pollution abatement works will be undertaken. The NMC is preparing detailed project report of this plan.
 
 To curb river pollution to some extent, the NMC in 2012 had planned to construct mini STPs with installed capacity to treat 5 million litres per day (MLD) at four locations — Shankar Nagar, Mokshadham and Reshimbagh on Nag river and Mankapur on Pili river. 
 
 The construction of Mini STPs at Mokshadham and Mankapur are nearing completion. The NMC had dropped the plans to construct other two due to strong opposition from citizens residing nearby.
