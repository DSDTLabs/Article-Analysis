 The bus was fairly empty, with a few seats still vacant, as the man in his 50s boarded the vehicle from near the   crossing and sat beside me. For the next 20 minutes, the man kept brushing his fingers against my body. When he reached further to touch my private parts, I stood up and raised an alarm.
 
 But to my surprise, none-—not even the conductor nor any other passenger—paid any heed or protested against the man. I tried to dial 100 and then looked out of the bus near Chingrighata crossing so that I could spot the cops on the road. But even then, none of the passengers helped me. Finally, a young man alighted from the bus and called a policeman, who dragged the man out of the bus. The culprit was subsequently handed over to the   police station.
 
 But at the police station, the cops began asking me weird questions, such as if I had made a video of the man molesting me, or had brought along any person who was witness to the incident. A woman constable even asked me how could I miss noting down the registration number of the bus. I told them I had brought the man, who was tormenting me, to the police station but they kept on dissuading me to lodge a complaint. They said it would be of no use and that I would be the one, who would be victimised for lodging the complaint.
 
 But I insisted on lodging a complaint. When I went to court, their lawyers threatened us for daring to lodge a complaint. I have done my part and now, I just hope the man gets the punishment he deserves.
