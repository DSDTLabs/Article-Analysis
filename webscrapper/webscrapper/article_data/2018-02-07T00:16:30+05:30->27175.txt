Pune: Students aspiring to appear for MPSC examination will take out a rally at Shaniwarwada on Thursday morning to press for more posts for recruitment, among other demands.

 “Almost 7 lakh students will take the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examination this year and the advertisements are out only for 69 posts. How can a state with 11 crore population have just 69 job openings every year?” Rajesh More from a students’ association said at a press conference on Tuesday.
 
 Their 15-point charter of demands includes biometric attendance in exam halls and barcode to ensure transparency in the assessment of answer sheets.
 
 Earlier, three different exams were held for the post of police sub-inspector, assistant section officer and sales tax inspector, Sachin Salunkhe, a student, said. “However, there is a common exam for all these three posts now. If a student is not able to perform well on the exam day, s/he misses the chance landing a job. The authorities should reintroduce separate exams for various posts,” he said.
 
 Citing a recent case of an MPSC aspirant cheating using his cellphone, More said cellphone jammers should be installed in exam centres to keep a check on such instances. “Even Class X and XII boards use bar code system for transparency, then why not the MPSC?” he said.
 
 The students also demanded that MPSC should declare its exam schedule way in advance to give ample time to students to prepare. “CBI should be made to investigate any cases related to MPSC exam fraud as it involves destruction of future careers of a lot of aspirants. The talathi examination should also be conducted by the MPSC as a lot of corruption happens at the district level during their recruitment,” Salunkhe said.
