PATNA: The Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) students of   (Patna campus) locked the institute and staged protest on the campus on Monday. They alleged that their course was not approved by the   (COA). BArch students of all batches joined the protest demanding immediate affiliation of the course with COA.

 Around 200 students had a meeting with the director in his chamber till Sunday midnight. A final year B Arch student said, “The director said the problem will be solved within a week. But, we will not be satisfied with the slander promises made by the college administration. They will not allow any classes till our problem is sorted out.”
 
 Another student said the COA ended the affiliation of this course in 2015, but it was continued till 2016 as an emergency case. “According to COA officials, the affiliation will not be renewed until the university is recognized by the   ( ). The COA tag is important for the architecture students to get training with prominent firms,” he said.
 
 In November 2015, UGC directed ten institutions, including BIT, to immediately shut down their off-campus centres, saying these were unauthorized and had been set up in violation of clause 6 of the UGC guidelines and Article 12(5) of the Deemed University Regulations of 2010. Later, in February 2016, the   (MHRD) said the deemed universities could set up and run up to maximum six off-campuses. Patna campus is one of the six off-campuses of BIT-Mesra.
 
 BIT-Mesra’s Patna campus director SP Lal said, “Everything will be done by the institute’s headquarters. On Saturday, I had a meeting with the BIT-Mesra (Ranchi) administration who assured me that they will apply to get the UGC recognition and the COA problem will also sorted out. It is a wait and watch situation for us. I told the students to wait.”
