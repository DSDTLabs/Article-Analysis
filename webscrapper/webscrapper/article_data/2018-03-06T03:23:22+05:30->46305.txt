NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will issue allotment-cum-demand letters to all the remaining allottees of   in the next two weeks and the authority will complete the development by March end, executive head of the authority said on Monday. The authority will also finalise the land pooling policy by April end.

 “Allotment-cum-registration letters to 13,574 registrants have been issued out of the remaining 14,288 registrants. The registrants have been given 180 days to deposit the land cost and requisite documents. The possession would be given once the land cost and documents are received,” DDA said.
 
 Meanwhile, those who have taken the DDA to the   for inordinate delay in handing over the plots even after 37 years said that the infrastructure development work has started recently and the works cannot be completed in the next two months. “The DDA is yet to submit its reply to a contempt petition. We will wait for their submission to expose in the court how they have done nothing except issuing statements,” said Rahul Gupta, who is fighting the case of successful allottees. 
 
 Gupta said allotment cum demand letters can’t be issued unless the infrastructure development is complete.
 
 Rohini Residential Scheme was launched in 1981 by DDA for MIG, LIG and EWS/ Janta categories. DDA claimed that considering the requirement of plot owners, it has allotted 23 shops in different sectors and all these will become operational by April end.
 
 DDA vice-chairman Udai Pratap Singh also said that the authority will hold public hearing with regard to the land pooling policy and it will be out by the end of next month.
