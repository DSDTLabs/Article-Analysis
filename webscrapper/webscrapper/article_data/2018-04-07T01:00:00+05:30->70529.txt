Denizens of the entertainment world are known to have quirky indulgences — be it cars, shoes, watches or houses. But the one person who stands out from this fraternity and has always made a statement via his style during his on-screen or stage performances is singer  . 

 Being an explorer at heart, the singer has a separate wardrobe dedicated to his footwear.   has multiple shoes that suit different occasions. More than a necessity, the singer is obsessed with shoes, which top his shopping list at all times. The singer makes it a point to pick up a pair of shoe whenever he is travelling. 
 
 Not only that, he recently customised shoes for a cricket team that he owns. Not only did he gift every player of his team a pair, but also the opposing team as well 
 
 Talking about this Navraj said, “As a kid, I would want every pair of shoes that I spotted. And when I grew up I made it a point to buy every pair that I spot.”
