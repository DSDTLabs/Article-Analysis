NEW DELHI: The   came down heavily on a PIL petitioner for “playing to the gallery” by pressuring the court to entertain his plea seeking court-monitored probe into the Rs 11,300 crore  .

 
 Petitioner advocate Vineet Dhanda continued to plead with a bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud for issuance of notice to the Centre, even as attorney general   said there was no need for judicial intervention at this stage as probe agencies had registered FIRs in the case and had effected arrests.
 
 “The whole country is watching the proceedings as the Centre had done nothing in the past in similar scams and allowed Vijay Mallya to flee the country,” Dhanda said and insisted that notice must go to the Centre on his petition which was airing the grievance of millions of Indians.
 
 The bench said, “When the AG is questioning maintainability of the petition, should we not hear him? Your purpose seems only to seek publicity. We should not pre-empt the government from investigating the case. If government agencies do not investigate the case properly, then we will examine whether we should intervene.”
