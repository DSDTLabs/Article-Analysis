GURUGRAM: Massive   is likely in  , the last surviving grove on  , an intelligence report by the forest office in Faridabad has indicated.

 The forest department, in turn, has written to the higher authorities to deploy home guards in the area to avert such a possibility. “We have immediately written to the higher authorities to approve a proposal to deploy home guards in the area,” said MD Sinha, conservator of forest, Gurgaon circle. 
 
 Sources in the department said that intelligence reports are mostly correct. “We mostly get such reports when a builder lobby tries to encroach the land. It is important to act on the tip-off immediately to save Mangar,” said a source in Faridabad forest office.
 
 In February last year, over 200 trees were reportedly cut in Mangar, about half a kilometre from Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary, which is an extremely sensitive ecological zone. 
 
 Mangarbani is a dense green patch located near the Gurgaon-Faridabad border and is one of the last remaining virgin forest areas in Delhi-NCR. The area has been under the threat of deforestation because it’s not demarcated as a forest. 
 
 Activists alleged that government agencies failed to protect areas which fall in restricted zones notified under sections 4 & 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act. No non-forestry activity is permitted in the area. “Watchers should be equipped with arms and walkie-talkies to carry out inspection,” said Vivek Kamboj of NGO Haryali.
