Mumbai: The Bombay   on Thursday restrained Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( ) from evicting occupants of structures on New Link Road in Jogeshwari (W) for   IIA without acquiring the land. 

 The interim order by a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla came on a petition by Adarsh Nagar Shree Adarsh   challenging the MMRDA March 9 notice to take over 1,600 sq m of the total 3,850 sq m land and to demolish 40 structures for the Metro line from Dahisar to D N Nagar. The society comprises 80 members occupying ground floor structures on land originally owned by MHADA. The notice also stated that alternative accommodation would be given to those eligible. It said if the society did not cooperate with MMRDA, police help would be taken. 
 
 “They are treating us like slums,” said senior advocate Mukesh Vashi for the society. Perusing the notice, Justice Oka remarked: “See the language! …You have to acquire the land. Can you simply tell them it is affected by Metro, we are throwing you out? Can you throw them out?”
 
 The society petition said that since the structures were old and dilapidated, it opted for redevelopment. MMRDA said over 1,600 sq m was affected by the Metro curve. The judges said MMRDA must negotiate with it.
 
 They noted that prima facie it was private land and only on the basis of a notice MMRDA cannot disturb possession of the society. They restrained MMRDA from “acting upon or taking any coercive action” following the notice “but with a rider that it shall adopt due process of law for eviction”, including giving the members a hearing.
