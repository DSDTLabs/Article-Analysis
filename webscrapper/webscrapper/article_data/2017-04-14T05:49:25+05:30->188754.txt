THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   ban on liquor outlets along the state and national highways is likely to come as a major bolt to  , a   that began its operations with the formation of the state. 

 The corporation has given loans to 150 beer and wine parlours-that are repaying promptly-of which half the number of beer and wine parlours are now affected by the court order.
 
 The KFC, which was staring at heavy losses, after the previous UDF government closed down bar hotels had begun recouping its losses through beer and wine parlours that were coming up. However,   is likely to face another hurdle through the closure of beer and wine parlours.
 
 According to the figures of the KFC, after making a meagre profit of Rs five crore in 2015-16, had made a strong resurgence by making Rs 350 crore as income through interests for 2016-17, against Rs 308 crore in 2015-16 and Rs 287 crore in 2014-15.
 
 The higher income was a result of much better loan recovery figures for the previous two financial years, which stands at Rs 873.38 crore in 2016-17 against Rs 758.26 and Rs 684.27 for 2015-16 and 2014-15 respectively. The loan recovery and income from interest for 2016-17 marked a hike of 13% as compared to the previous year. The non-performing assets of the corporation were 10.57% for 2015-16, which dropped to 9% in 2016-17.
 
 KFC managing director M G Rajamanickam said that the corporation achieved a better financial position as compared to the previous year through liberal and time-bound repayment policies that made it easier for those who availed loans to repay the loans.
