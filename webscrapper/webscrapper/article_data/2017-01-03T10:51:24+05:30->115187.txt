AMRITSAR: Delhi unit of   (SAD) has sent a missive to Prime Minister   to   and give amnesty to Sikh political prisoners who have served over 10 years in jail.

 Talking to TOI on Monday, Delhi SAD president Paramjit Singh   said that the party had sent a letter to the PM and had also sought appointment to discuss the issue of blacklist and Sikh political prisoners. “There can’t be any better opportunity than the birth anniversary of Guru   to make this announcement since majority of Sikhs want these people to join mainstream and spend their life peacefully,” he said.
 
 Most of the Sikhs who have been blacklisted are those who had been involved in militant activities in Punjab and went abroad to escape arrests, staged demonstrations in front of Indian embassies in other countries, delivered speeches against India or had provided shelter to the terrorists. Many of them were declared proclaimed offenders. They are not allowed to visit India. Similarly, Sikh political prisoners are those who had actively participated in the separatist movement and were involved in anti-India activities and also in heinous crimes.
 
 The Union government had made three categories of blacklists starting from three, five and 15 years ban on return to India. Most of the Sikhs were blacklisted between 1985 and 1990, during the days of militancy in Punjab.
 
 “It’s been 26 years but the government has not scrapped even the names of those Sikhs who were banned for three years,” Sarna said. “We want the government to scrap the so called blacklist of the Sikhs in toto and free Sikh prisoners, who have served more than 10 years in jail, except those serving sentences for heinous crimes,” he added.
 
 He said the blacklist was like a black spot on the nation’s human rights records.
