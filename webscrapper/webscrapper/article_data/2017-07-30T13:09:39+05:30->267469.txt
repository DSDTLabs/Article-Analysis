NAGPUR: For the first in state education department’s history, private candidates can apply online for board exams. 

 These private candidates will have to fill up a separate form known as number 17. 
 
 Sriram Chavhan, assistant secretary of Nagpur divisional board said, “We are slowly moving towards an era of digitalization and integrating all our process with computers is going to be the way ahead. 
 
 “Asking private candidates to register online only is just as extension of the series of similar steps the board has taken in the last one year. Ultimately, digitalization helps us reduce the man-hours required for the mammoth task.”
 
 Now, private candidates won’t have to submit a copy of their school transfer certificate to complete the registration process. They can submit an affidavit/self declaration in lieu of the TC. 
 
 All documents must be scanned and uploaded online during the submission of the form. It is mandatory for students to provide a valid e-mail ID and mobile number for further communication. 
 
 After the form is submitted, a detailed receipt will be sent on the registered e-mail ID. 
 
 Students must print the receipt, attach proof of   it to the designated school or college. Institutes will then collect these forms and submit it to the board for processing. 
 
 It is expected that in next couple of years every single process in this chain would be put online where in no   of form will be required. The state board is undertaking multiple initiatives to ensure rapid digitalization. The latest venture, Maharashtra State Open School, will heavily rely on digitalization to reduce the paperwork.
