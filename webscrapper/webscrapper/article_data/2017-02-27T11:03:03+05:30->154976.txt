BHOPAL: One man in every three minutes was caught   in Madhya Pradesh in this financial year. The startling fact came out in latest figures compiled by distribution companies. As per official information, 1.93 lakh people were caught stealing power between April 2016 and January 2017 by vigilance teams of power discoms.

 On an average, around 632 people were caught stealing power daily and 24 were caught every hour!
 
 But this is only a tip of the iceberg. The annual revenue requirement (ARR) filed by distribution companies before Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) puts distribution losses at 14,255 million units of power. In terms of rupee value, the lost power is worth Rs 4,900 crore. In Madhya Pradesh, power companies reported average loss of around 23% against the commission’s 17% standard for current financial year.
 
 A major part of distribution loss is due to unbilled power or power theft. Given topography of the state and limited resources, it is a Herculean task to curb power theft cases, says an official. There is a need to create awareness. It requires behavioural change, sources say.
 
 The irony is honest consumers end up paying for acts of power thieves as power tariff is hiked to offset loss, sources say. 
 
 The anomalies were found after only 11,13,566 meters were checked by vigilance staffers. Of these, 86,837 people were caught stealing power by vigilance teams of Purv Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company, 56,956 by vigilance teams of Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company and 49,229 by teams of  . Subsequently, 26,600 cases of power theft were put up before court by distribution companies and a whopping Rs 160.89 crore revenue was recovered. 
 
 Unmetered agriculture distribution transformers are also adding to distribution losses. 
 
 As per official figures, around 25-30% of agriculture distribution transformers are metered in the state. 
 
 The remaining 70% also contributes to distribution losses. All distribution losses drag down per unit revenue close to Rs 2. This is when cost of per unit electricity purchased by discoms works out to Rs 3.8 per unit, sources say.
 
 Jolted by it, distribution companies are now focusing on smart meterisation and funds demanded from the state government in this financial year. Adoption of advanced technology will reduce power pilferage, say sources. 
 
 Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company has already started automatic meter reading of users who consume more power. In case of anomaly in pattern of consumption, vigilance teams can immediately check meters, sources say.
