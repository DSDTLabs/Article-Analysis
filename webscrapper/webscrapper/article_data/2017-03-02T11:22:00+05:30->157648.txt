JALPAUGURI: A   court has remanded  , arrested in the baby-trafficking case, in 12-day police custody.

 The CID, which is probing the case, has got the call records of Juhi's mobile, in which they have found her speaking to some influential people in Delhi, including the confidential assistant of a BJP leader looking after the party's Bengal unit.
 
 According to the CID, the accused had demanded two things from Chandana Chakraborty, the owner of the   under scanner, to “fix her problems“: a resort in Jalpaiguri and 50% share of the profits made by Chandana, especially from the alleged advance she got from “foreign“ clients. The demands were allegedly made days before the state rescued 14 children from the home, citing irregularities.
 
 “To probe her Delhi links, we will take her there,“ said additional public prosecutor Pradip Chatterjee, pleading before acting CJM Payel Banerjee. The CID is likely to question Juhi and Chandana together after CID found proof that several lakhs had exchanged hands.
 
 On her way to court, Juhi told TOIshe wanted a CBI inquiry. “I have been framed. It's a political conspiracy. I have been in the BJP since the Left regime,“ she said. “Chandana claims I have been helping her for three years. An independent probe will show I have known her for not over three days.“ Juhi pointed out Chandana was parroting what the CID wanted her to.
 
 Juhi's claim the same day the CID moved in to question the home's former chief adoption officer. CID also brought Chandana's sister-in-law Rita Barui Bhowmick to the Jalpaiguri court to record her confession.
