MYSURU: Six weeks after violence broke out in Hunsur over a   procession, the district administration has cleared the way for the procession on a route that was earlier restricted. It has agreed to allow devotees to take out a procession on January 27.

 In a tweet, MP Prathap Simha has asked his followers to get ready for the procession from Ranganatha Badavane.   D Randeep told TOI, “We have agreed for the procession on January 27 but a formal notification will be out in a day or two.”
 
 Meanwhile, district police too are gearing up for the procession after they were orally communicated about it.
 
 Earlier the procession was scheduled on December 3 but police had restricted devotees from taking out a rally via Ranganatha Badavane which was not a regular route. But the organizers demanded that the new route be included. When the police refused saying the district administration has to agree if a new route has to be added.
 
 After MP  , who was on his way to the procession was stopped mid-way and then taken into custody, the devotees and organizers protested demanding the MP’s release. Police had to use mild force and took a few of them into custody. The mob too retaliated by pelting stones at policemen leading to tension.
 
 A total of 58 were arrested following the violence and were remanded to judicial custody. BJP members led by MP Shobha Karandlaje protested against police action by staging a protest near Gandhi Square and demanded permission to take out a procession, the following day.
