CHANDIGARH:  , the native village of Gurbaksh Singh   was converted into a cantonment as his family and relatives refused to cremate the body while blaming local administration of forcing him to take the extreme step. His kin are demanding registration of a case against the officers of police and civil administration, who were present at the time he took the extreme step of taking his life. 

 Khalsa, an activist who had started fast unto death in Mohali and in Ambala last year, began the fast on the 70 feet high water tank at his native village on Tuesday. He had been demanding the release of over 100 Sikh hardliners who are currently lodged in various jails across the country even after their term of sentence has expired.
 
 Khalka's kin alleged that since local administration and police had threatened him, this forced him to take jump off the water tank.
 
 On the other hand, IG  , the spokesperson of Haryana police, maintained that elaborate arrangements had been made to prevent loss of life due to jump.
 
 "Cops had put the up net around the water tank. Besides, we had dug up the earth around the water tank to ensure that the soil was softened. Besides making personal appeals by policemen and local administration, his sons and other family members too made appeals to him through the public addressing system,'' said Mamta. "Our officers and local administration is pursuing them to perform the last rites of the dead body," she added.
 
 Meanwhile, inquiries revealed that he had suffered multiple fractures added with head injuries. 
 
 A board of doctors carried out the postmortem examinations and the entire proceedings were videographed.
