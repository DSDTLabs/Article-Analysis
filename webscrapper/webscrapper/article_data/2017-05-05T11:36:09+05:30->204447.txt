SURAT: Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has issued an urgent advisory to members of trade on circulation of fraudulent email communication asking for payments in its name. 

 GJEPC office-bearers stated that some members, including owners of the diamond and jewellery companies in Surat and Mumbai, received phishing emails with regard to payments to be remitted to certain bank accounts in order to facilitate participation in overseas exhibition. 
 
 The fraudsters had sent the emails in the name of GJEPC mentioning changes in the previous bank accounts due to some reasons. 
 
 The members were asked to deposit the money in the bank accounts on urgent basis.
 
 The GJEPC urged the members to be extremely cautious of such phishing emails with regard to payments especially where bank accounts are being provided and has requested them to report any suspicious email communication received at the council’s office in Surat, Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata and Jaipur. The GJEPC has asked the members to forward such email messages to the specially created email id ‘cyberalert@gjepcindia.com’ for reporting to law enforcing agencies. 
 
 GJEPC’s regional chairman   told  , “Many diamond and jewellery companies from Surat and other centres participate in overseas exhibition. Being the apex body, the members have to send the deposit and booking amount to the GJEPC. In the phishing email, the members have been informed about the change in the bank account of the GJEPC. A few from the industry have already been cheated.”
