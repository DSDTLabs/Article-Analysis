Ludhiana: The new outdoor advertisement policy, which has been recently notified by the local bodies department, has fixed the responsibility of the MC officials to keep a check on illegal hoardings in the city but in reality, the picture is quite different. In the past three years, officials were careless when it came to issuing challans to the illegal advertisers. Information sought under RTI has revealed that in the past three years, the civic officials have issued only a few challans thus turning a blind eye to the menace of illegal hoardings in the city. In fact, in some months, they did not issue even a single challan to the violators.

 RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had asked the department to provide a month-wise detail of the challans issued to the violators for installing illegal hoardings in four zones of the city in December 2017. The officials provided the details after a gap of almost three months and even now, the officials of zone C did not provide any information regarding challans issued in 2015.
 
 In 2015, the civic officials issued 4,199 challans, in 2016 they issued 6,634 challans and in 2017, they issued 5,275 challans for the installation of illegal hoardings. Notably, the officials in zone C and D issued only a few challans and in months such as January, February and March and then in September, October and November, there was not even a single challan issued by the officials.
 
 The problem was severe in some of the areas and the officials seem to be ignorant of the menace. Even in zone A, the mobile store owners have displayed huge advertisement boards but the officials seem to be ignorant of the scenario. Similarly, in the previous years, the officials of zone D issued only 850 challans for violations. The officials claimed that lack of staff and other responsibilities were some of the major factors behind the less number of challans. 
 
 However, when asked, MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said that the new advertisement policy has been finalised and the local bodies department has uploaded the policy on the website. He said they will appoint a nodal officer to keep a check on the illegal hoardings and number of challans will be increased.
 
 The new advertisement policy has fixed the responsibility of the civic officials for the implementation of the policy and the appointment of one nodal officer for regular inspection of city roads. In case, there is lacuna, the officials will have to pay a price.
