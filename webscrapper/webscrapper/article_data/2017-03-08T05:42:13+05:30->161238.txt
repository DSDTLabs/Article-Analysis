GURUGRAM:   (HIPA) has ordered an internal inquiry against one of its Class IV employees for allegedly misbehaving with a   inside the campus.

 The incident, according to sources, came to the fore last week when the project officer complained to the authorities alleging that sweeper Rajesh Kumar (35), who was drunk at the time, misbehaved with her.
 
 According to sources, though the initial complaint hinted at molestation, the institute is probing alleged misbehaviour with its woman officer. A medical test proved that the employee was drunk.
 
 Asked if police are probing the matter, SHO of Sector 18 police station Ram Kumar said they didn’t receive any complaint though a cop was sent to the institute to take the accused for a medical test. “It is the internal matter of the department,” Kumar said. 
 
 HIPA director Prasanna Kumar said the sweeper was “charge-sheeted” after he was found guilty. “We have all relevant committees, including sexual harassment committee, in the institute to carry out probes as per the norms. We are now probing if the sweeper had misbehaved with the woman officer,” Prasanna Kumar said.
