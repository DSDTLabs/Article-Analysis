  Spending hours on the treadmill is a rookie mistake, because it does not help strengthen or work your core. It also puts a lot of pressure on your lower body, making your joints brittle. Diversify your workout and stretch your limbs. 
 
  
 
 
  When we exercise, we do it not only to burn away fat, but also to build muscles. Without proteins, this does not happen. So, up your intake. 
 
  
 
 
  Did you know that there should be a two-hour gap between your last meal and your workout? Or that metabolising proteins is difficult for the body, so a protein-rich meal should never be consumed before a workout? Carbs before a workout is ideal. Chart your meals.
 
  
 
 
  Exercising can be very dehydrating for your entire body, be it your skin or your muscles. It is crucial to maintain your electrolyte balance by hydrating with ORS and sipping water throughout the day. Your skin will also thank you for it.
 
  
 
 
  Being fit is 20% exercise and 80% diet. By this, we do not mean crash-dieting. But we do mean that bingeing on burgers and pizzas every day is not going to do you any good, just because you have been hitting the gym regularly. 
 
  
 
 
  Going to the gym seven days a week is a terrible idea. This is because your body needs time to rest, recover and build muscles. If you work out every day, your body will get dehydrated, it will be in pain and more importantly get accustomed to that unsustainable routine. So, when you skip the gym, you’ll put on weight at the drop of a hat. Go for something more achievable.
