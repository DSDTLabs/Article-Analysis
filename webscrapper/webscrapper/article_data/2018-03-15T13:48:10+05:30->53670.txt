MADURAI: Seeking to bring petrol and diesel under the GST ambit, a petition has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. 

 The petitioner   said that the main aim of GST is one nation one tax. But, petrol and diesel had not come under the GST. Due to it, the fuel prices are increasing day by day. 
 
 Minister of petroleum and natural gas   recently said that the   should consider bringing petroleum products in its ambit. If it is done so, the price of those fuels would come down.
 
 Taking into consideration the present price, if petrol is brought under 12%, 18% or 28% GST slabs, the price will be about Rs 38, Rs 40 and Rs 43 respectively. Similarly, if diesel is brought under 12%, 18% or 28% GST, it will be priced at Rs 31, Rs 33, Rs 37 respectively. 
 
 Demanding to bring these fuels under the GST, the petitioner sent a representation to the Prime Minister’s Office and other officials concerned, on February 16. But, there was no action, the petitioner said. 
 
 Hence, he wanted a direction to the Prime Minister’s secretary to instruct Union secretaries of finance, law and justice, petroleum and natural gas GST council secretary to bring the petrol and diesel under the GST ambit.
 
 It is expected that the case would come up for hearing on Thursday.
