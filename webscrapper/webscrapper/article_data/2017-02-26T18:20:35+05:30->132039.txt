 The former   stars were often subject to long stints on the road, and the 25-year-old said the pair used to love doing 'something mischievous' after a show.
 
 "I went through a long time, especially toward the last three or four years in the band where I only really stayed on the tour bus. So I wouldn't really do the hotel that often. Sometimes   would stay with us, and it would get to like one in the morning, we'd finished on stage and we'd finished the whole atmosphere and we were coming down a little bit. 
 
 " We were like 'OK, lets go and do something mischievous.' So we would always go and hopefully try and find a golf caddy with some keys in, steal it, take chase from security, and feel like gangsters driving golf caddies," Tomlinson said.
