  : Riding the development plank, Uttar Pradesh chief minister   on Tuesday said three and a half years of   leading at the Centre has ushered immense progress, the kind that the state could also witness if it voted BJP to power. 

 "If the same party is in power in the state and at the Centre, development is faster because there is no ideological fight. Tripura, too, needs a BJP government to spur the state's development," Yogi said. Accusing the state's Left Front government of doing little to make use of the resources, Yogi added, "Tripura has been blessed with good rainfall. Yet, the state's agriculture sector suffers from a lack of irrigation facilities, people do not get safe drinking water and no industry based on water resource has come up here."
 
 Dismissing allegations of BJP being a communally disruptive force, Yogi said it is the law and order situation in Tripura that is worrisome. "There have been 550 attacks on BJP workers and leaders in Tripura over the past one-and-half years. Eleven BJP workers were murdered in the same period. Police have failed to take any action," he added.
 
 Two weeks after the Kasganj violence, Yogi claimed Uttar Pradesh has "not seen any riot or communal incident" in the last 10 months since he became chief minister. Citing Uttar Pradesh as a model of "inclusive development", Yogi said equal opportunity is given to those belonging to SC, ST and OBC categories when it comes to government jobs, social security schemes and other benefits. "In UP's tribal areas, the government has provided all facilities, including employment generation and an improved social standing. This is not the case in Tripura," he added.
