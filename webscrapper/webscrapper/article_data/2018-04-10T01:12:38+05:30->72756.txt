NEW DELHI: To blunt the attack launched by   president  , who sat on a fast along with senior party functionaries at Rajghat on Monday,   chose to hit back with a photograph of senior Delhi Congress leaders eating chhole-bhature before joining the event.

 Delhi Congress president  , who is seen in the photograph, lashed back, saying this attack by BJP shows “how low it can stoop to divert an issue”. Rahul decided to sit on the day-long fast to protect and promote communal harmony and protest against caste violence across the country. 
 
 The story took a twist when Delhi BJP’s   took to Twitter slamming the Congress leaders for making a mockery of the fast, which was called by Delhi Congress. “The fake Congress revolutionaries were pretending to fast to extend their support to the Dalits. The picture reveals the truth as they had lunch before the two-hour fast. This is mockery of the feelings of Dalits,” Gupta tweeted. They are “busy filling their stomach just before the fast”.
 
 However, Maken said BJP was more interested in knowing what the Congress leaders were eating than addressing the issues. “The picture was taken in the morning. If people are joining an event, it is natural that they will eat something before it.” He added, “The fast was observed by all Congress members for five hours to support communal harmony and to support Dalits.” 
 
 Delhi Congress heavyweights Haroon Yusuf and Arvinder Singh Lovely were also seen in the photo. “Instead of running the government, they are concentrating on what we are eating,” said Lovely. 
 
 He pointed out that the photo was taken before 8am. All of them, the Congress leader said, were at Rajghat from early morning with Maken to oversee arrangements and stopped for a quick bite at a roadside restaurant in Daryaganj before heading for the event. “We never said we are sitting on an indefinite fast.”
