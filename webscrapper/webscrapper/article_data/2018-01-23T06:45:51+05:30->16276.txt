CHENNAI: The   of jailed AIADMK leader V K   appeared before the   commission on Monday and presented her arguments before the panel’s counsel. The commission is probing the circumstances surrounding the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. 

 The panel will grant another hearing to Sasikala’s advocates on January 25 pertaining to the summons issued to her last month. 
 
 Following the summons on December 21, Sasikala had filed a petition with the commission demanding the documents pertaining to submissions made by other witnesses who had presented evidence against her. She had sought a period of 15 days after the commission gave the documents before replying to the summons.
 
 The commission allowed her advocate Rajasenthur Pandian to present her arguments before the commission based on which it would take a call on whether the documents can be provided or not. On Monday, former assistant commissioner (customs) of the Central Excise and   Tribunal (CESTAT)   appeared before the commission. He had filed a public interest litigation on April 17 last year seeking the formation of a panel to probe Jayalalithaa’s death.
 
 Officials also said that the commission has requested the state government to form a medical committee to study the documents pertaining to the medical records of Jayalalithaa. 
 
 Apollo Hospitals had provided the photocopies of an exhaustive list of documents to the commission 10 days ago. 
 
 Officials added that the commission would need the assistance of doctors to analyse the documents which would help them in the probe.
