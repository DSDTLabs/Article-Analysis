NOIDA: The   is   to keep a tab on   used in the construction of realty projects. 

 Speaking to TOI, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate B N Singh on Monday said he would discuss possible steps to introduce checks in the quality of material being used by builders for construction and completion of projects. Reacting to a spate of complaints from residents of new apartments about plaster peeling off ceilings, balconies or building exteriors, Singh said he would take up the issue with both Noida and Greater Noida authorities to find possible solutions.
 
 The Noida Extension Flat Owners Main Association (Nefoma) wrote to the DM on Monday, asking that the Noida and Greater Noida authorities impose quality checks on the material being used by builders in new residential projects.
 
 The buyers’ group also sought his support in the implementation of adequate quality control in the material being used on site at projects where work is presently underway.
 
 “Last week, during the heavy rains, we received news of plaster falling off ceilings in several apartments. We have complained about the quality of material with both authorities earlier as well. We will also take our complaints to the chief minister if required. So far, only reports of vehicles or furniture damage have been informed. Who will take the responsibility of a serious injury to a resident in such an incident?” asked Nefoma president Annu Khan.
 
 In several such incidents of plaster peeling off, the builder has taken the responsibility of repairs, but the buyers are now concerned that there could be the possibility of insuring the lives of the residents as well. “It is easy to fix broken plaster. Who will ensure the safety of the residents? Will it be the government or the builder? Also, if a monsoon can lead to such damages, what will happen to these apartments in case there is a calamity?” Khan said.
