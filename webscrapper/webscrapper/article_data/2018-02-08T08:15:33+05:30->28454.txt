BHOPAL: The families of 350   from the  , who were waiting for seven years to get  , have finally got their  . 

 TOI had reported the families’ ordeal in its December 14, 2017, edition. LIC has now cleared payment of Rs 84 lakh to 336 farmers. Additional secretary Shekhar Verma, who first took up the matter as Alirajpur collector, said that it’s the biggest-ever claim settlement at one go in group insurance scheme for marginalized farmers. LIC officials told TOI they have settled all the claims in which the administration sent a complete set of documents. 
 
 Rajesh Rathore, who is in charge of insurance section under Jila Sahakari Kendriya Bank Maryadit, Jhabua, confirmed to TOI that claims of 336 dead farmers have been settled. “I am in constant touch with LIC officials and sending them documents needed to settle the remaining claims,” he said. About 64 claims remain.
 
 The unsettled insurance claims first came to light at a public hearing of the then district collector in 2014. “After coming across a case of unsettled death claim during public hearing, I conducted a camp to find out how many such claims are pending. There were 400 such claims in the district. I took up the matter at district as well as at the state level. The insurance firm must also clear payment in the remaining claims at the earliest,” Verma told TOI.
 
 LIC had provided group insurance cover to the farmers while Jila Sahakari Kendriya Bank, Jhabua, was the nodal agency in Alirajpur district. These societies paid premiums for the farmer group insurance scheme, which covered each loanee farmer. LIC officers said the delay was due to the nodal agency. “LIC settles all its claims at the earliest. There was a delay in this case as details were not provided by the nodal agency,” said an official.
