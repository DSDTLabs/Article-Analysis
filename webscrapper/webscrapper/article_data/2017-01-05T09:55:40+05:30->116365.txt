RAJKOT: A 23-year-old man, identified as Jaydeep alias  , was found dead at his rental house in Anandnagar on   on Tuesday late night. The father of the deceased,  , has alleged that his son was murdered.

 Police found injury marks on the body that appear to have been made by a blade.
 
 According to police, Jaydeep, an electrician, was found lying on the floor of his house by his neighbour who called the 108 emergency service. On examining Jaydeep, the paramedics declared him dead. 
 
 Primary investigations revealed that Jaydeep was in a live-in relationship with a married woman. However, his parents, who live in   near Ranuja temple in Rajkot, did not approve of their son’s choice.
 
 “Jaydeep started living separately after his parents asked him to end the relationship with a married woman identified as Madhavi. His father, Anil Tank, who works at a state-owned power distribution company, has alleged that his son was murdered,” police sources said.
 
 However, Madhavi told police that Jaydeep went to his room after returning from work and lost consciousness.
 
 As the cause of death is not clear even after the postmortem, police sent a viscera sample for forensic analysis to ascertain the cause of death.
