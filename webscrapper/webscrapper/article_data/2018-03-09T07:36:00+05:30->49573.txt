CHANDIGARH: A delegation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes ( ) led by their chairman   and vice-chairman L Murugan suggested that the   government should use robots for cleaning sewers to completely abolish the illegal practice of forced manual scavenging. The commission also pointed out that many police officers were still registering cases under the relatively milder provisions of the old SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

 In a meeting with chief minister Amarinder Singh, the commission underlined the need for police officers to register cases under the more stringent clauses of the amended Act of 2015, which was notified in 2016. This will ensure that victims and their families get higher compensation to which they were entitled to under the amended legislation. Amarinder directed DGP (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta to arrange for the sensitization and training programme of the police officers. He assured the delegation of stringent measures to ensure strict enforcement of the Act in order to prevent atrocities against SCs and STs.
 
 On the issue of recent deaths of some SC persons in reported cases of forced manual scavenging, Amarinder assured the delegation of complete implementation of the   guidelines in this regard. He also sought a report on the viability of using robots.
