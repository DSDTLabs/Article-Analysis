NEW DELHI: The Congress party today landed in a soup after it published a tweet condoling the demise of actress   in which it said that the actress was awarded the Padma Shri by the UPA government in 2013.
 
 
 
 
 "We regret to hear about the 
 . An actor par excellence. A legend who will continue to live in our hearts through her stellar body of work. Our deepest condolences to her loved ones. She was awarded the Padma Shri by the UPA Govt in 2013," said the now-deleted tweet.
 
 
  
  
 Many on social media were left fuming by the last line of the tweet and accused the Congress of showing insensitivity towards her family, friends and fans.
 
 
 
 
 "Sridevi didn't get Padma Shri, Padma Shri won Sridevi," read one tweet suggesting that the legendary actress' stature was even bigger than the national award.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 "Now don't blame the PM for her death," read another tweet.
 
  
  
 "Cheap politics" shouted the Twitter handle of BJYM.
 
  
  
 "Padma Shri is given by the country to its citizen - not by any political party," a user on Twitter pointed the factual inaccuracy in the Congress's tweet.
 
  
  
 "It did not take credit for Sridevi living, eating and breathing in Congress-ruled times," another user on Twitter took a swipe at Congress.
 
  
  
 
 Following outrage, the tweet was deleted from social media.
