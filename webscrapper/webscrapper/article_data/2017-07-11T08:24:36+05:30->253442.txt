NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   asked top officials of the Centre and states on Monday to maximise usage of   to check corruption and prevent leaks in welfare schemes. He also asked states to accord top priority to 'ease of doing business' to attract more investment, saying the country must make best use of the "golden opportunity" as the world wanted to partner with India.

 Addressing a conference of chief secretaries of states and Union Territories organised by  , the PM said, "The use of Aadhaar has brought benefits all around, and eliminated leakages." He urged officials to maximise use of Aadhaar in the interest of good governance.
 
 The PM spent around two and a half hours and heard all 30 chief secretaries of states and UTs who made presentations on one best practice of their states.
 
 "The PM strongly urged officers to adopt a positive attitude to new initiatives. He said the elected political leadership would always be receptive to new, positive ideas, irrespective of ideology," a PMO statement said. Urging states to come out of silos and work cohesively with the Centre and with each other, Modi asked officers to remain mindful of the credo of “competitive cooperative federalism".
 
 As states are competing with each other on social and economic indicators such as heath, education and water after Niti Aayog started ranking states on outcome-based parameters, Modi asked officials that similar competition must start between districts and cities.
 
 At the meet, Niti Aayog vice-chairman   said a strong India could be built by building strong states which could be achieved through “job creation, shift to non-farm jobs (and) large firms with high productivity“.
 
  said, "For the first time, the PM took direct inputs from chief secretaries. It raises the morale of state bureaucracy." Cabinet secretary P K Sinha said competition between states being promoted by Niti Aayog was very useful and states must promote similar competition between districts.
