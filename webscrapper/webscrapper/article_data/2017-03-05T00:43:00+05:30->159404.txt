Mangaluru: After much dilly dallying, the   is finally set to decentralize its administration by opening one of its three zonal offices on Monday. 

 Acting on a government directive to open zonal offices in a bid to provide various services offered by   closer home to the stakeholders and for effective redressal of their grievances, the MCC will open zonal offices at Surathkal (Zone 1)followed by Lalbagh (Zone 2) and Kadri (Zone 3) at MCC main office.
 
 Incidentally, while Lalbagh office was supposed to function out of MCC’s main office at Lalbagh, protestations from corporators saw the council of MCC shift the Kadri office also to the civic body’s main office rather than at its commercial complex at Kadri-Mallikatte. The MCC for long had a sub-office at Surathkal, which has since been upgraded to a zonal office. Officials from MCCs main office used to visit the sub-office once a week.
 
 As things stand, zone one will have 12 wards (ward 1 to 11 and 60); zone two 31 (wards 12 to 19; 23 to 31; 36; 39 to 42; and wards 55 to 58) and zone three will have 17 wards (wards 20 to 22; 32 to 35; 37-38; 48 to 54 and ward 59). Post Monday, the MCC will serve people through its central office and three zonal offices and officials have been redistributed to these offices as per availability and as mentioned in the cadre and recruitment rules of MCC.
 
 The commissioner has delegated some of his powers to the zonal commissioners for effective functioning of these zonal offices. M Shashidhar Hegde, chief whip of the ruling   in MCC, told STOI that zonal offices II and III will be inaugurated either towards the end of next week or third week with the honour going to the new mayor who will be elected on March 9. 
 
 “Work on the zonal offices II and III is going on at MCC main office and hence the delay,” he said.
