KOLKATA: The   is constantly working to upgrade and improve its   supply system to sort out the crisis that usually occurs in several pockets of the city in summer. 

 
 During the monthly session of the civic body on Monday, KMC mayor   said the civic authorities were taking a number of interim, temporary and long-term measures to improve supply of water in the city. "We are constantly working on this and plans are being taken and implemented in phases," the mayor said.
 
 The civic body is planning to set up a 10 million gallon capacity water reservoir at Garden Reach. The project is pegged at Rs 100 crore. The civic authorities are also working on plans to install a 40-inch water-distribution line from Garden Reach to Tollygunge and increase the duration of water supply at some places.
 
 "Shortage of water occurs in some pockets of the city during summer. This is normal. However, plans are on to improve the water supply system," said a civic official.
 
 A massive pipe burst at the Garden Reach water treatment plant in March had affected water supply to a huge area of South Kolkata. Residents of places like Tollygunge, Ranikuthi, Bijoygarh and Naktala complained that the water pressure has been low since then. "The pressure of water is still low. This has been going on for the last two months after the Garden Reach pipe burst," said a resident of Bijoygarh.
 
 The authorities are also planning to install water meters from ward 1 to ward 6, at Joka and at areas off EM Bypass towards   on an experimental basis to see how the process works. However, residents will not be charged.
