MYSURU: CM   faced some embarrassing moments during a roadshow in   constituency on Wednesday when his friend of 15 years, Mariswamy, a gram panchayat member, turned down an invite to join him. Mariswamy said he would support the JD(S) that has promised the deputy chief minister's post to a   if it came to power. 

 At Hale Kesare village, Siddaramaiah recognized some of his old friends - Veerabhadra and gram panchayat member Rajanna - and spoke to them. When he did not see his other friends, Siddaramaiah, standing atop a vehicle, asked the local leaders about Mariswamy.
 
  They pointed to Mariswamy, who was standing with a bunch of people at a distance and watching the roadshow. Mariswamy is a Dalit member of Siddalingapura Gram Panchayat. Siddaramaiah called Mariswamy to come close to him and asked him why the Dalit leader had distanced himself from him. The CM asked Mariswamy if he remembered he used to visit the latter's house. Mariswamy refused to go close to the CM, stating he supports JD(S) and asked the   leader to continue with his roadshow. 
 
  While the CM asked Mariswamy to support him, the GP member said he was associated with the JD(S) now. The CM indicated that working for the JD(S) was akin to helping the   which, he said, had leaders like Union minister Anantkumar Hegde who were openly advocating changing the Constitution and destroying statues of BR Ambedkar. But Mariswamy refused to buy the CM's argument, saying he will work for JD(S) candidate GT Devegowda.
