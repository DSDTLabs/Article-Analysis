SURAT: With a view to encourage the textile sector in Surat and south Gujarat region and to create ‘Brand Surat’, the   ( ) has organised a three-day long   (SITEX) starting from February 25. 

 According to SGCCI office-bearers, this time around the focus is on the weaving sector and the introduction of the circular knitting machines, used by India’s largest garmenting centre in Tirupur. 
 
 Around 175 exhibitors from across the country including Ludhiana, Punjab, Maharashtra etc. are participating in the three-day event to be held at the Surat International Exhibition and Convention Centre (SIECC). 
 
 SGCCI president, BS Agarwal told TOI, “Our focus is to introduce state-of-the-art textile machinery for the Surat cluster. Surat’s man-made fabric (MMF) industry contributes around 40% of the synthetic fabric demand. Through the exhibition, we want to encourage the powerloom owners to upgrade their machines in order to match the international standards.”
 
 Agarwal added, “Surat’s contribution in the export of MMF fabric and garments is negligible. On the other hand, Tirupur, having just 20,000 circular knitting machines, is exporting around Rs 25,000 crore worth of fabrics and garment per annum. It is our endeavour through the exhibition to provide an opportunity to the weavers to upgrade their units.”
 
 Chairman of SGCCI’s exhibition committee, Praful Shah said, “Around 80 per cent of the textile machinery manufacturers participating in the SITEX event are from the city. WE have organised a series of seminars, fashion shows and buyers-sellers meet during the three-day long event.”
