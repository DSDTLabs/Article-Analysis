BENGALURU: The high court directed a family court to waive the mandatory six-month cooling period for a Bengali couple who were mutually seeking to part ways.

 The six-month cooling period is mandated by law when a petition of divorce by mutual consent is filed under section 13B of the Hindu Marriages Act. But the HC directed the 4th additional family court to expeditiously consider the petition filed by   and her husband  .
 
 The couple had challenged an order of the family court which rejected their petition to waive the cooling period.
 
 Upali told the HC that she wanted to move to Kolkata as soon as possible to look after her widowed mother. She also wanted to admit her eight-year-old son in a school there. Anirban told the court he had no objection to   moving and that he also wanted his son to continue his education in Kolkata.
 
 In its order, the high court said family courts are required to deal with disputes sensitively and noted that the law, which is aimed at maintaining peace and harmony in society, would be a self-defeating one if that objective was not met.
 
 “Undoubtedly, the period of six months was imposed by law in order give both parties time to coolly reflect on the repercussions and consequences of a divorce,” Justice   observed in his order. “However, the requirement of law would not mean to be an obstacle to matrimonial disputes being buried quietly between the parties,” he said.
