VASCO: The poor condition of roads in   have made it impossible for vehicles, especially two-wheelers, to commute safely. One one side of the two-way road is being used as the other side is in bad shape due to the ongoing sewerage line work for the last six months. 

 Since the work on the replacement of the sewerage line at Baina began, a roughly 500m stretch has developed stony patches at about 8-10 places. 
 
 While travelling from Ravindra Bhavan to  , the right hand side lane cannot be used and motorists are forced to use the opposite lane. 
 
 There have been minor accidents and traffic jams everyday as vehicles try to use a single lane for two-way traffic. 
 
 Mormugao Municipal Council chairperson Deepak Naik agrees that "the road has become dangerous and has called a meeting of officials on Monday and have asked them to start road repairs from next week". He added, "We cannot afford to wait for the monsoon as there are chances of more accidents due to water entering the pot holes."
 
  assistant engineer P M Naik said the department has been granted permission on the condition that it repair the road after the work is complete.
