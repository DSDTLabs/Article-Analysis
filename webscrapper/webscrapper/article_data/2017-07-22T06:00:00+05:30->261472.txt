on Thursday evening, social media erupted in unison raving about all-rounder Harmanpreet Kaur’s blistering 171-run-knock against   in the Women’s World Cup semi-final. While the posts laced with superlatives 
celebrated the 28-year-old’s willow power, sexist undertones in most of them were hard to ignore.
 
 “Harmanpreet Kaur striking the ball beautifully! She bats like a female version of Yuvraj”; “Harmanpreet Kaur is lady   of Indian team. She made the umpire do yoga many times with her sixes and boundaries”; “New Yuvraj Singh in middle order #HarmanPreetKaur… Same long six... Same style”, read some of the posts. And then there were comparisons with Yuvi’s winning knock when India took on the   in the 2011 World Cup semi-final.
 
 Even when Harmanpreet, despite a hamstring blow, was sending the Aussies on a leather hunt, smashing fours and sixes, the camera panned towards a fan in the stands who held a placard that said, ‘Harmanpreet is the Yuvraj Singh of women’s cricket’.
 
 Thankfully, a few sniffed out the sexism and were quick to declare that Yuvraj, in fact, is the male version of Harmanpreet and should be replaced by her in the men’s team. But that too was unwarranted. Why is it so difficult to keep gender out of the equation when it comes to acknowledging excellence? After years of struggle, women’s cricket is slowly but surely getting much deserved credit. What India needs to do is hail these super girls as heroes in their own right. They wouldn’t compare lions and tigers, would they?
