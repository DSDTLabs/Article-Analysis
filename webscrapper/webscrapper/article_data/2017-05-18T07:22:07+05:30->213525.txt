CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board ( ) tenements in   constituency, deteriorating after years of lack of care, pose a life  .

 Many are on the threshold of collapsing and the menace of disease hangs heavy in the air due to a complete  . More than 5,000 families reside in the tenements, which TNSCB constructed in the 1970s in Dr Santhosh Nagar, KP Park, PK Colony, RK Puram, Saalaima Nagar, Osankulam, Nehru Park, Gangadeeswaran Koil, Dhideer Nagar and MS Nagar.
 
 The horrific living conditions that residents face are evident in these places. KP Park, for one, has 35 structures. Garbage and sewage fill spaces between them. Broken staircases reveal compromises residents make for a roof over their heads.
 
 Egmore MLA K S Ravichandran (DMK) said the tenements outlived their life expectancy long ago. In KP Park, 350 families live in makeshift structures that encroach on footpaths after TNSCB demolished buildings to construct them anew.
 
 “The board has not even laid a foundation stone in five months,” ex-tenement dweller and current encroacher Amul said. “Do you realise how difficult it is to live in a 100sqft asbestos shack in summer, without water or sewerage lines?” Similarly grim conditions mark other tenements. Repeated pleas by residents to TNSCB officials have yielded no result.
 
 Affordable housing policy researcher Vanessa Peter said guidelines do not affix responsibility for tenement dweller safety on any agency.
 
 Board officials cite “lack of funds” as a reason for lack of maintenance and say residents don’t want to move. “We cannot start reconstruction till the old buildings are demolished and, for that, people have to vacate,” a senior TNSCB official said.
