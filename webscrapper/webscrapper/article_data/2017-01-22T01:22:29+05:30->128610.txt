NAVI MUMBAI: The civic administration has decided to put up 10   at various points around   holding pond, also known as Jewel of Navi Mumbai, to prevent the repeated   in the area.

 The administration’s decision came after there were repeated instances of property destruction.
 
 “Just two months back, many decorative poles around the pond were broken and the vandalism was repeated recently. Just last week, some more poles were damaged. This led the administration to consider installing CCTVs to catch the miscreants,” said an official from civic engineering department.
 
 The holding pond is spread over five hectares and has multiple access points. Officials state that even though there are security guards present but the area is so vast that there is a problem in safeguarding the area.
 
 “Estimates are being drawn to have CCTVs installed all over the pond area. Some of the points to be covered are the three-entry points, two parking lots, the area adjacent to thinking man statue, open gym and toilets,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan. He added that this should help them nab the miscreants involved in intentionally damaging public property. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
