Mumbai: Stocks of some of the leading auto makers, including commercial vehicle major Ashok Leyland and two-wheeler leader  , closed sharply lower on Wednesday after the   banned sale of vehicles which are not compliant with   emission norms, from April 1. According to market players, these two companies have the biggest inventory of vehicles that do not comply with the new emission standards. 

 In a statement the CV maker, however, said that it was already producing vehicles that adhere to the new emission norms and not availability of fuel for BS IV compliant vehicles on a pan-India basis was the main reason why several buyers still preferred BS III compliant vehicles.
 
 In Wednesdayâ€™s market, the Hero Motocorp stock closed 3.2% lower at Rs 3,223, while Ashok Leyland lost 2.8% to Rs 84. Among other auto makers, Tata Motors closed 0.7% at Rs 469, Maruti lost 0.6% to Rs 5,941, while   was up a marginal 0.3% at Rs 2,831. 
 
 According to reports, among others, Bajaj Auto and Maruti will not be affected by the SC order.
 
 The rupee meanwhile stormed to a new 17-month high and closed above 65, a level not seen since October 2015, on heavy dollar selling by speculative traders and exporters.
 
 The   122 points to about one-week high of 29,531, spurred by SBI and ICICI Bank, ahead of the derivatives expiry on Thursday.
