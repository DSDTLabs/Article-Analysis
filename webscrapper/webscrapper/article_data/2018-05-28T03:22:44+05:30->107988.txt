NAVI MUMBAI: Encouraged by the Union road transport and highways minister  's support to the demand for bringing fuel under   purview, online activists have shot out a fresh online missive addressed to PM   as part of the campaign #GST4Petrol. 

 The online petition, now gaining ground, has also pointed out that   chief minister   has come out in support of bringing diesel and petrol under the GST purview. 
 
 "  rules in 22 states then what stops it from meeting this nationwide demand," the petition stated.
 
 The petition quoted latest media analysis which clearly shows that GST would help petrol prices come down by Rs 29 a litre and asked a simple question: "Why can't we bring petrol and diesel prices under GST net?"
 
 As many as 200 people have already signed the petition.
