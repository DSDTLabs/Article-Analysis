CHENNAI: In the latest in a string of brutal assaults on   of  , at least five of which have in the past month culminated in the death of the victim, locals near Periapalayam bashed up a 20-year-old man from Virudhunagar district who had travelled to Chennai in search of a job.

 The Periyapalayam police, alerted to two men stirring up tension by charging Muthupattu Raju with attempting to steal a child from the locality, arrived in time to save the man, but not before he received a sound thrashing.
 
 Investigators on Sunday arrested Sakthivel, 24, and  , 23, for the assault. The two men had tried to fuel misgivings about the stranger, who they suspected was from a northern state, and summoned their friends to the spot before beating him up around 7.30pm on Friday, an investigating officer said.
 
 A resident of   in Virudhunagar, Raju had come to Chennai a few weeks ago in search of a job, the officer said. Failing to find employment in the city, he headed to Tiruvallur a few days ago and was scouting construction sites in the hope of landing a job.
 
 “Raju was passing through Serathur village near  , around 35km northwest of Chennai, on Friday evening when Sakthivel and Vallarasu intercepted him,” the officer said. “Because they suspected that he was from another state, they questioned him in broken Hindi and English.”
 
 “Raju could not understand a word they were saying,” he said. “They took his silence as a sign of guilt and beat him up. We rescued him and took him to a hospital for first aid.” 
 
 Later, on a complaint by Raju, the police arrested Sakthivel and Vallarasu.
