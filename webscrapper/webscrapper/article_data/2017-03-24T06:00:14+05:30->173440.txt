BENGALURU: The alleys of   and Ambedkar Nagar in southeast Bengaluru were overrun with children on Thursday morning. With eight anganwadis operating in the area closed for four days, parents of young children were concerned about how they would get to work.

 With the strike now called off, mothers can look forward to their work routine.
 
 Sudha Y, a resident of Rajendra Nagar, said her three-year-old daughter was attending a local anganwadi for a year, which gave her the freedom to work. “They give the kids three meals a day and milk. When the school shut, I had to ask my neighbours to watch her. I cannot stop going to work,“ said Sudha, a housemaid who earns Rs 4,000 per month.
 
 Anganwadis are a godsend for the construction worker, maid and coolie, who have nobody to leave their children with. For daily wage workers, every single day makes a difference.
 
 Meherunissa, 26, a tailor who earns Rs 3,000 a month, had to work from home as she couldn't leave her children unattended. “I don't like working from home despite having a sewing machine. My daughter Farhad clings to me. I cannot devote the same time and energy to work,“ she said.
