 Bahu produced by   (Sunny Side Up) and Hum Tum Telefilms (Sushant Kumar and  ) is not only popular amongst the small town audience but also liked by the urban viewers. Dipti Kalwani Bahu's writer and producer says,"Badho will keep surprising you, she is very unpredictable and her attitude towards life is unique. The storytelling is engaging, because the journey of a fat person is the same everywhere. People can relate to a character like this easily."

 The show also has a strong backdrop of wrestling, so post Dangal will the awareness be more? Dipti says,"Badho Bahu is conceived on the basis of wrestling only, but the story before Badho's marriage was liked by the audience. But now all the focus is on the sports theme. How Badho will become a wrestler is a key point of interest. We have seen a father daughter story like in Dangal where   helps his daughters to become wrestlers. But in Badho the father-in-law will help his daughter-in-law to become a wrestler. That is unique. This I think is a brave attempt and it needs a lot of courage to face the opposition of the society." The supporting cast of Badho Bahu is also getting a lot of applause. Dipti shares they went through a very detailed casting process and thus the show has got an amazing set of supporting cast. Dipti adds,"A women getting into a sport like wrestling is not easy, so she has to face a lot of hardship and now audience will see how she will conquer all this with her determination."
