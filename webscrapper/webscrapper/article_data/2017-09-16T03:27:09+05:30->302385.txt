NEW DELHI: The condition of most   schools seems to be going against NMMC’s efforts towards being one of the cleanest cities in the country this year. 

 Residents have alleged that the state of civic   is pathetic with even playgrounds turning into dumping yards. Even some of the ‘model schools’ are in shambles. Residents compared these schools with the one at Ambedkar Nagar in Rabale which was awarded the best civic school. 
 
  TOI visited several civic schools and found most of them in a pathetic state. 
 
 “We have to go past slush and a flooded entrance at school number 42 while dropping and picking up our kids. Garbage has been strewn all over the school ground, leaving our wards with no place to play. While the school in the mayor’s ward has got the cleanliness award at the national level, other schools have been left in utter negligence,” said a parent from Ghansoli.
 
 A portion of a school in Airoli’s sector 6 has not been cleaned for months, said a parent whose ward is a student there. “With grass and other plants growing during the monsoon, we fear snakes and other reptiles visiting the ground,” the parent added.
 
  When asked about the lack of cleanliness in civic schools, additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan said, “I have taken note of such schools and will ask the education department to take a look at all schools and take action.” 
 
 Mayor   said, “I have asked the authorities to ensure cleanliness at the Ambedkar Nagar school which had got the national award under the central government’s   drive. This seems to be the responsibility of corporators.”
