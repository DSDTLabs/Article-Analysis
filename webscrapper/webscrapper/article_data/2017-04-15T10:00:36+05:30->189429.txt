NAGPUR: The   workers called of their strike on Friday after the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) enhanced their wages to Rs112 from present Rs90 per day.

 32 workers were on strike for the last two days forcing the animals to suffer. The zoo cages were not cleaned and on Thursday even the staff was forced to close the zoo.
 
 Talking to TOI, acting PDKV vice-chancellor VM Bhale said, “The issue has been resolved after wage hike. We have also posted a veterinarian to replace the one who was transferred.”
 
 However, the steps taken by PDKV, which manages the zoo affairs, are not only meagre but also temporary in nature. The vet   posted in zoo already works in   dairy farm in the city.
 
 Secondly, the wage hike of Rs22 per hour is still not at par with minimum wage of Rs300 per day. Workers are paid by Rs6,500 per month with certain adjustments.
 
 Meanwhile, in a letter written to zoo controller & associate dean of College of Agriculture, Nagpur, Sanjay Thakre, member-secretary the   (MSZA), has asked to follow guidelines of   (CZA). The recognition of the zoo ends on December 31, 2017.
