LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday amended its earlier order regarding posting and transfer of Station House Officers (SHOs) at police stations wherein   were required to seek a written approval from district magistrates before making such changes. As per the amended order, the district police chiefs can now post and transfer the police station in-charge after mutual consultation and agreement with the DMs and no prior written approval of the latter is required. 

 The amendment is being seen as a major victory for the IPS cadre which had raised objections over the May 9 government circular issued by principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar stating that the district police chiefs should seek a written approval from the district magistrates before transfer and posting of police station in charge in their respective jurisdictions. Among the IPS officers, this was seen as a direct attempt to curtail the professional rights of the district police chiefs.
 
 Airing the sentiments of UP IPS officers, the   had tweeted an appeal to chief minister   urging him to withdraw the directives which reiterated that district police chiefs should seek written approval of the district magistrates to transfer and post station officers. 
 
 
 
 The tweet said that such government directives showed disregard towards the post of SSP/SP and would demoralise police.
 
 Sources said the amendment came after the state police top brass appraised the chief minister about the May 9 circular in which written approvals of the DMs was made mandatory,explaining thatchanges can lead to bad blood between the IPS and IAS cadres at the district level. The CM, who was already awareof theugly letter war between the DM and the SSP of Gautam Budh Nagar that unfolded after the May 9 circular, thereafter directed the state home department to issue an amended circular.
