GURUGRAM: A day after an Axis   ATM was stolen by unidentified assailants in Jharsa, an ATM of Punjab National Bank (PNB) was stolen in Khoh village near   on Thursday night. The matter came to light only on Friday morning when bank officials noticed the theft and approached police.

 According to police, no guard was stationed at the ATM. PNB officials have not ascertained the amount of cash in the ATM yet, but sources said it could be several lakhs.
 
 The ATM booth is located in Khoh village on Manesar-Kasan road. The accused damaged the CCTV camera and took away its digital video recorder (DVR) and the ATM machine itself. An FIR has been registered against the unidentified accused under sections 457 (house breaking)and 380 (theft) of IPC at IMT industrial police station, Manesar.
 
 “The thieves seem to have struck the ATM book with a plan, as they first targeted the CCTV camera. We found the camera damaged and the DVR missing. We are investigating the case,” said inspector Narender Yadav, SHO, IMT industrial police station, Manesar.
 
 ATM thieves have been active in the city for the last few months, rattling both police and banks. Police blamed security lapses on the part of banks and security agencies for the thefts. “We have held many meetings with banks on security measures to be taken, but here they did not have even have a guard in the ATM booth. Both thefts seem to be the handiwork of the same gang. In addition to looking for the thieves, we will also look for anomalies on part of the bank,” said Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime).
 
 The Axis Bank ATM stolen on Wednesday contained Rs 9 lakh. The same ATM booth was targeted in December last year by three masked men, police said. The accused had sprayed the CCTV camera with black paint and made off with the ATM machine and the DVR.
