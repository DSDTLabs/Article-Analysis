NEW DELHI:   on Friday described the Election Commission’s decision to postpone polling in   assembly constituency in Bengaluru as a result of “corrupt electoral practices and attempts of bribery" by the ruling Congress in  .

 
 “The Congress party seems to have completely given up any hope of winning the election in Karnataka,” said railway minister   at a press conference. He said the incident of Rajarajeswari Nagar could be just the tip of the iceberg as reports of fake voters’ identity cards are coming from nearby Yeshwantpur assembly constituency as well.
 
 Goyal said BJP urges the   to see that no bogus voters are allowed to cast their votes for which all newly enrolled voters should be asked to show an additional ID other than the voters’ card.
 
 “We request the EC to advertise that the new voters will be required to carry an additional identity card. We have no idea of the scale at which Congress has vitiated the election process,” the minister said.
 
 Reading out the order of the EC, Goyal said the Congress candidate in the area had done it in a planned way, targeting a particular vulnerable community.
