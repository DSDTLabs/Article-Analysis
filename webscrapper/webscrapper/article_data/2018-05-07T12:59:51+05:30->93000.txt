AGRA: The controversy over  's portrait took a new twist on Sunday when the grandson of the late   king   reached Aligarh with his grandfather's portrait and demanded that the same be displayed at AMU since "he had donated the land to the institution". 

 His grandson,  , also demanded the name of the university should be changed and it should be named after his grandfather so that everyone, including the students, becomes aware of his contribution to the institution.
 
 According to the varsity's website, the Jat king who defeated former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1957 Lok Sabha polls from Mathura, did lease 3.04 acres of land to AMU in 1929 at a rate of Rs. 2/- per annum.
 
 Supporting Garundhwaj's demand, state president of Hindu Jagran Manch, Ghanshyam Lodhi, said that Mahendra Pratap Singh's portrait should be installed in the campus. "In fact, it should be present in all the offices of AMU," he said. 
 
 BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey, who was in Aligarh on Sunday, said, "There is no need to waste time on Jinnah, who was responsible for destroying the integrity of the nation." He, however, refused to comment on whether Jinnah's portrait should be removed from the AMU campus. 
 
 Meanwhile, AMU Students Union president Mashkoor Ahmad Usmani said that he has no issues if Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh's portrait is put up in the university campus.
