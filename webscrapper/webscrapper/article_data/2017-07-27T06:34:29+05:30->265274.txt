KOLKATA: Three Class-X students of   received minor injuries when a ceiling fan fell on them while they were attending a class. The incident took place around 3.20pm. The injured have been identified as Arka Biswas (15), Arkoprava Mukherjee (15) and Kaustav Das (15).

 While the first two students are residents of   area, the third victim is a resident of Entally. All three were rushed to Calcutta Medical College & Hospital. Later, they were discharged after primary treatment.
 
 Police said the incident was reported from room 13 of the building, which was newly renovated. All three victims are students of section B. The   police have started a probe although no case has been registered yet.
 
 Headmaster of Hare School, Sunil Das, is still in a state of shock. “These were all new fans. They were fitted just two months ago. We had replaced all the old once just to avoid such accidents,” he said. 
 
 Some of the school teachers said the ceiling of the school is high and the old fans were attached to old rods. But after renovation, the new fans were attached to new rods and one among them had come off. 
 
 “Whatever the case may be, PWD should ensure that all electrical fittings are regularly checked.   is part of the city’s heritage and a government-run school. It needs to be maintained properly. Today’s accident will leave students in a state of shock and we are lucky that it did not turn fatal,” said  , general secretary of the Government School Teachers’ Association.
 
 Former president of the Association, Dipak Das, was of the same opinion. “The PWD office is right behind Hare School. So, why shouldn’t the inspections happen regularly? The maintenance of these old government schools has been a long-standing issue, which needs immediate attention,” he said.
