Bengaluru gal and National Fresh Face winner 2016,  , has got her first filmi break. The youngster is currently shooting for her debut feature, an as-yet-untitled Marathi flick.
Directed by debutant  , the film is a coming-of-age story of three youngsters, played by  ,   and Ria. “Nupur has co-written the story with Yogesh Joshi, the man behind  . He then hired casting director  , whose work includes the National Award-winning  , to put the cast together. I got onboard after several rounds of auditions, for the role of Chandrika, the female lead in the film,” says Ria.
 The role, adds Nupur, saw the team audition at least 70-80 girls. “I was very clear that I only wanted actors who were around 19-years-old, preferably freshers. In fact, the first time Ria auditioned, we outright rejected her, because her school of acting and mine differed vastly. Rohan, however, insisted that we give her another shot, and a month later, we spoke again and I explained what I was looking for. Her next audition was a marked improvement from the first and she has been a revelation on the set,” he says.
