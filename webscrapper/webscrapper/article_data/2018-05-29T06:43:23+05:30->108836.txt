PANCHKULA: Three days after a fire broke out in dumping ground firemen were still fighting to control the blaze on Monday. Locals said the continuous exposure to the smoke from the dump was causing them breathing and other problems. 

 The dumping ground is located near residential area and is posing breathing issues to residents as smoke has engulfed the entire area. The fire began on May 25 and since then over 25 fire tenders have been engaged to gain an upper hand over the flames.
 
 Fire station officials stated that methane gas is formed in garbage, which after getting heated up due to high temperature prevailing in summer causes fire. Fire station officials have appointed at least one fire tender at the dumping ground to ensure the blaze is under control.
 
 Shamsher Malik, fire station officer, said, "Methane gas has caused fire and it cannot be controlled by pouring water. Sand must be used to extinguish it. We have intimated MC officials to provide us sand tractor-trolleys."
 
 The residents of Sector 23 to Sector 28 are suffering at large.
 
 Nearby locals also alleged that they have witnessed dumping ground personnel igniting garbage on several occasions.  , 37, a resident of Sector 23, said, "The smoke cloud prevailing during day and night has made life difficult. The concerned officials must control the fire."
 
 Bhupinder Gill, a resident of Sector 25, said, "It feels as if we are living in village rather than a HUDA sector. The dumping ground must be shifted from the residential area."
 
 Jarnail Singh, executive officer, MC, said, "We have already sprawled sand over the dumping ground. I have asked persons to use more sand at the dumping ground so that fire can be controlled."
 
 Health officials stated that smoke erupting from dumping ground contains dangerous dust particles. These particles pose more threat to infants, elderly people and the persons having severe breathing problems like asthma.
