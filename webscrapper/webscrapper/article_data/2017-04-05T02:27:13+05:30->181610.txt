GURUGRAM: Nearly 1.49 lakh students between Class I and Class VIII, enrolled in 439 primary and 262 middle schools of  , will now be reciting math tables along with morning  . 

 In what may be viewed as a pedagogical experiment, the district education department is trying to ensure qualitative education in government schools, after it recently observed that about seven percent of the students in Class IX could not even read or write properly.
 
 “All government schools have been instructed that students from Class I to Class VIII will recite multiplication tables from 1 to 20 and count till 100 during morning  . The last half hour of the day will be devoted to dictation of various subjects,” said  , district education officer, Mewat. 
 
 The order was enforced from Saturday (April 1). 
 
 It may be recalled that in 2006, the state education department had labelled Mewat as a priority area due to poor literacy rate. “The whole belt is very backward and poor. This part of Haryana is almost illiterate. Literacy programme is the dire need of this area, in order to bring the population into the mainstream of development,” the state had noted. 
 
  As per the 2011 census, while the average literacy rate in Haryana was recorded at 75.55%, the literacy rate of Mewat was much lower, at 54.08%. Even the neighbouring Gurgaon district recorded an average literacy rate of 84.70%.
 
 Some educationists are of the opinion that the no-fail policy till Class VIII may be one of the factors hampering quality education in government schools.
