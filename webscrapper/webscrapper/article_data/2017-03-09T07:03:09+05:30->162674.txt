BENGALURU: A   allegedly hacked a 24-year-old   to   at his   on Wednesday morning. 

  had walked out of jail only 10 days ago, police said. The school dropout had been arrested two months ago in an attempt to murder case. Last year, Sunil had been arrested on dacoity charges.
 
 Around 8am on Wednesday, Sunil was watching TV when five men barged into his house, police said. "His mother Asha Bhaskar was in the kitchen. The men, who had come on three bikes, began to attack Sunil with machetes and knives," police said.
 
 Sunil ran out of the house but the assailants followed him and caught up with him near the gate. Though Asha tried to save her son, the men pushed her aside. The men continued to stab Sunil even though the neighbours shouted that he was dead, and asked them to stop. The men later fled, police said.
 
 Cops said they were yet to get an idea from doctors on the number of injuries Sunil sustained. "Asha also suffered injuries. She was treated at a nearby hospital," police said, adding "We strongly suspect the role of another rowdy element, Naga alias Spot Naga."
 
 Sunil and Naga were close friends till February 2016 but developed differences while handling a civil dispute. Sunil had allegedly attacked Naga in October 2016. "An attempt to murder case was booked against Sunil and he was sent to Parappana Agrahara central prison," police said.
