Surat: A woman and her daughter were washed away in the heavy water current at a check-dam in Vansda’s Kurelia village in Navsari district late on Thursday. The rescue operation was still on. 

 Official sources said the duo, residents of Kurelia village in Vansda, had gone to the check-dam to see the water. Accidentally, they slipped into the gushing waters and got swept away with the current. 
 
 The duo have been identified as Ramilaben Narayan Patel (62) and Rasilaben Sunil Patel (25). 
 
 Official sources said that two villages in Gandevi taluka of Navsari district — namely Ghol and Desra — were cut off due to heavy rains and flooding in river Ambika. The authorities have blocked the low-lying bridge between Navsari and Gandevi for safety of the commuters and pedestrians due to rising water levels in the river.
 
 Talking to TOI, district collector, Navsari, Ravi Kumar Arora said, “The rescuers are continuously trying to locate the bodies of the two victims who slipped in the check-dam at Kurelia village in Vansada. The authorities in Bardoli, where the water of the check-dam flows, have been alerted and police complaint has been lodged.”
 
 Arora stated that the water level in river Purna in Navsari was at 25 feet due to heavy rainfall in its catchment area in Waghai in the Dangs. The danger level of the river is 35 feet and that they will start shifting exercise once the level will touch 30 feet. However, the rain situation in Waghai was under control. 
 
 “Two dams in Navsari, namely Jhuj and Kelia, are likely to overflow. Though Jhuj dam is at 90% of its capacity, Kelia dam, which is relatively small, is likely to overflow. We are keeping a close watch on the water levels in the dam,” Arora said.
