SURAT: Over 500   employed with a partnership firm of a leading   at Kapodara went berserk here on Friday evening and pelted stones at the building demanding their outstanding wages of past three months.   arrived on the spot and dispersed the unruly crowd. 

 Few days ago, these diamond workers had shouted slogans outside the factory premises against the company management for not giving them wages since the past three months. 
 
 Diamond workers alleged that the company had opened their bank accounts and told them that the wages either will be deposited directly into their accounts or they will be given cheques. However, the company management failed to deposit wages in their bank accounts and in giving cheques to them. The workers approached the company owners who informed them that they are running short of cash due to demonetization. 
 
 Sources said after demonetisation many diamond companies and firms were facing difficulties in withdrawing money from the banks due to shortage of new currency notes. 
 
 “We asked them to at least pay Rs 5,000 each to the workers but the company management has found a good excuse of demonetization,” said an angry worker.
 
 “There is a shortage of new currency notes with the banks and the diamond companies do not have enough cash to deposit in the bank. The workers are suffering, so are traders and manufacturers,” said a member of Surat Diamond Association (SDA).
