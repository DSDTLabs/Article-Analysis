Call it chivalry or love,   has truly won over our hearts with this gesture. The actor, seated in the front row at the 62nd Jio  , rushed to ladylove Alia Bhatt’s rescue when she walked into the arena, dolled up in a pink gown. She had a moment of discomfort walking in it with the trail behind. And guess what? Sid got up from his seat, which was a few steps away, and went up to her. He held her hand and helped her find a seat and settle in. 

 “Alia was a little tired after performing to a medley of songs. After the act, she also walked the red carpet and completed some of her social media obligations. For the act, she had to slip in and out of a couple of costumes. Eventually, when she walked into the main award venue, she was eager to be seated with her friends, but was finding it difficult to locate a place. She was relieved to find help from Sidharth,” says an eye-witness. Now, that may not be a big deal, but chivalry and concern do help relationships go a long way.
