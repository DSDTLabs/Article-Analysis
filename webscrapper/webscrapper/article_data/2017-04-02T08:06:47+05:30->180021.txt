NAGPUR: Over 2 lakh litres of water was used to douse the weeklong fire at Bhandewadi dumping ground, a quantity that could have been enough for a day’s use by around 2,000 people.

 With temperatures rising by the day, chances of fire outbreaks will increase, so will the requirement of drinking water. To avoid its shortage, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) is preparing a proposal to save drinking water by using treated   in firefighting operations at Bhandewadi.
 
 The NMC operates a sewage treatment plant (STP) at Bhandewadi having a capacity of 100 million litres per day (MLD), which is presently treating 80 MLD sewage. According to NMC officials, around 70 MLD is released into the Nag River every day.
 
 After a spot inspection, members of Green Vigil Foundation suggested the NMC to use the leftover treated sewage for extinguishing the fire. “The biochemical oxygen demand of treated sewage is 30 mg/l, chemical oxygen demand is 250 mg/l, total suspended solid is 100 mg/l and PH value is between 6.5- 7.2. These values are ideal for   fire,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.
 
 The NGO proposed the idea to senior NMC officials. “We inspected the spot too and found two chambers located inside the dumping yard. We plan to collect the treated sewage in the chamber and also install a fire hydrant and water pump to draw it. The paperwork is in process,” said an official.
 
 Chatterjee added that as the dumping yard is at a lower level than the STP geographically, the sewage will flow by gravity. “This will save the cost of pumping out water,” he said.
 
 Fire tenders of NMC’s fire and emergency services department had to complete numerous trips daily to douse the massive fire last week. “This process took up a lot of time. If we start using treated sewage, fire can be extinguished faster,” the official said.
