PANAJI: Stating that there are several loopholes in the story regarding government formation by Union minister  , Congress has stood by its claim of ‘horsetrading’ of MLAs.

 Party spokesperson Girish Chodankar said that the statements of Nitin Gadkari have not answered the questions raised by the people. “Gadkari has not answered that on what moral grounds they formed the government after eight of their ministers, including the chief minister, lost.   and Gadkari have formed an immoral government in Goa. The state’s governor issued a statement that she was advised by  . We want to know what advice was given to her as she did not invite the single-largest party to form the government. She was also pressurized by the BJP,” Chodankar alleged.
 
 The party also questioned the role of a wrestler from Uttar Pradesh who, as told by Gadkari, helped in convincing Vijai Sardesai. “Someone by the name of   or Dinesh Singh was brought in from Uttar Pradesh to decide Goa’s fate. Gadkari should clarify what are this person’s links and interests in Goa,” he said, adding that Gadkari came in with multiple briefcases to Goa in chartered flights.
 
 Chodankar also predicted that there is growing rift within the BJP and there will be split in the party in the coming three-four months due to disgruntled party workers.
