AMRITSAR: Suggesting that there was no need to discuss the vicious   unleashed by certain Pakistani militant groups through   and violation of ceasefire by Pakistan, Union minister of state for home Kiran Rijiju, who visited   on Saturday, said everyone knew what the Indian government and forces were doing to tackle the situation.

 Rijiju was at Attari to take stock of the security of India’s first integrated check post (ICP), trading activities with Pakistan and the passenger movement besides monitoring the ongoing development work by the   (LPAI). On the occasion, he also hoisted a 107 feet high national flag. After unfurling the flag, Rijiju said Attari was a very important and significant border of India and he would ensure that the flag flutters all the time.
 
 Asked about the instigating act of Kashmiri youths pelting Indian forces with stones being propagated by certain Pakistan-based militant outfits through social media, he said there were certain groups and individuals in Pakistan who indulged in anti-India propaganda. “But there is no need to discuss the issue in media as it will not give any benefit. The government of India is doing whatever is required,” he maintained.
 
 Commenting on the anger among Indians over the killing of soldiers at the LoC in Kashmir and incessant incidents of violation of ceasefire by the Pakistan army, Rijiju said, “I justify the resentment among people but you also understand the situation.” About the   in the installation of full body scanners at the ICP, he said that the project had been delayed for various reasons. He added that after the tender for the scanners was floated, one of the parties gave a complaint, which had to be verified. “But everything has been done now. World class full body scanners will be installed at the Attari ICP soon,” he quipped.
