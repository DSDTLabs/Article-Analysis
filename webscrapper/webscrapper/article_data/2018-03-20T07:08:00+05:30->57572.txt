PATIALA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday released a CD of the video recording of the voting process during the recent municipal corporation elections in Patiala to claims that the polls had been rigged.

 Former minister Surjit Singh Rakhra alleged that the video recording of the election process held in ward number 14 of Patiala which had been obtained through the   Act showed that the   won the polls held in December 2017 by capturing the booths and encouraging bogus voting.
 
 He claimed that in the video recording they had identified, a large number of Congress workers, who had been allowed to cast votes in ward number 14 at Patiala, even as they hailed from Dakala, Samana and Patran. He said the party was now filing more RTI queries to acquire video footage of all polling stations. “These would be scrutinized by the cyber wing of SAD to identify the wrongdoings of the Congress leaders and workers during the civic polls,” Rakhra said.
 
 He said it was hard to believe that the state machinery was not a part of such irregularities and the party had sent letters to the  , state election commission, Punjab governor and even the state government seeking appropriate action.
 
 Rakhra said in case the government failed to take appropriate action, they would move the Punjab and Haryana high court and challenge the   polls. SAD leader also released voter identity cards of about 15 persons, supposedly visible in the footage, who hail from other areas of Patiala district.
