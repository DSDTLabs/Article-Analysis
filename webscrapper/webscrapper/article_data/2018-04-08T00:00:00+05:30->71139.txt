1.The crop at the ankle: If you’re wearing cropped jeans, crop it right. Cropped jeans should end right above the ankle or slightly grazing it – nothing below or above.

 2. Light-wash vs dark wash: Dark washed jeans are for the evening and lighter ones, for the day. 
 
 3. Avoid bundling up: If your jeans are bundling above the shoes, get them altered. 
 
 4. Slim-fit vs skinny: Slim-fit means a slimming silhouette and skinny means a glove-like fit. Men with thicker thighs should avoid skinny.
