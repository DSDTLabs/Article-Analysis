GHAZIABAD: A special team to investigate incidents of arson and violence during the Dalit agitations in Ghaziabad on April 2 was formed by   Vaibhav Krishna on Thursday. The team will be headed by SP (crime)  , who will be assisted by six policemen.

 Krishna said the need for forming the team was taken because a lot of evidence pertaining to the violence needed to be studied in detail to identify the suspects.
 
 “Till Wednesday, 32 people had been arrested across Ghaziabad for their alleged involvement in the violence. No further arrests were made on Thursday. There are one dozen FIRs pertaining to the violence. In addition, hundreds of people have been named as accused in these cases. Rounding up the suspects and arresting them will need a special team focused entirely on the cases. We have a lot of evidence on the violence during the protests. The team has been directed to identify the offenders from footage and photographs,” said Krishna.
 
 The 12 FIRs pertaining to the violence have been registered across various police stations of Ghaziabad district. Police said 285 people have been named as accused in these cases under stringent   sections. Investigations conducted so far have revealed the involvement of several persons having political and bureaucratic influence in the state. In Kavi Nagar police station, a former deputy superintendent of UP police has been named as one of the accused for his alleged involvement in leading and instigating mobs on April 2.
