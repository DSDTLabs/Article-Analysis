HYDERABAD: In a massive blow to the Naxal network, which is already tottering in Telangana, 10 guerrillas of CPI (Maoist) armed with AK-47s and rocket launchers were gunned down on the   side of the border on Friday in an operation led by   Greyhounds. 

 Of them, seven were women.  , a commando with the elite anti-Naxal fighting force, was killed in the exchange of fire. After the bodies were identified, speculation that the Greyhounds had killed Telangana state committee secretary of CPI(Maoist), Haribhushan, was proved wrong. 
 
 The wily guerrilla leader still remains elusive. “After specific inputs on movement of Maoists in a large formation on Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, police of both states launched a joint operation. Around 6 am on Friday they sighted a Maoist camp. The guerrillas immediately opened fire and we retaliated in self-defence,” Amber Kishore Jha, SP of Bhadradri-Kothagudem told TOI. 
 
 Barely 18 hours after the encounter, Maoists opened fire at a police camp at   on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border late Friday night. However, no one was injured in the attack. The 10 Maoists killed are from the second central regional command (CRC) that directly reports to the Maoist central military commission member, Devji alias Tipparti Tirupati.
