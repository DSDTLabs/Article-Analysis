KOLKATA: You will get to hear stories of   on every second corridor of  , but in reality,   — and not unavailability of   — is leading to the demand-supply mismatch. Even on Monday, 800 units of blood were destroyed at the   in Manicktala since they had crossed the expiry date.

 There is a genuine crisis for blood in the state due to the demand-supply gap and most blood banks ration the supply system. But there is a lack of coordination between blood banks and the supply system. 
 
 Gopal Dutta of Arambag had to visit the blood bank in Manicktala twice to get four units of A+ blood for his grandson who has thalassaemia. “For the past two days, I have been travelling from Arambag to Kolkata for four units of blood. I got two yesterday and got the rest today. Getting them at one go would have made things so much easier.”
 
 Sabita Pal from Barasat had to stand in the serpentine queue at the Central blood bank before she managed to procure two units of B+ blood on Monday. 
 
 “Destroying few units every now and then due to expiry issue is normal. But 800 units in one go is rare,” said a health department source.
 
 Those associated with blood donation movements fumed at the wastage. According to them, Bengal used to top blood donation (in terms the units collected) in India even a decade ago. But the graph started declining since 2010, pulling down the state’s position to 13.
 
 “We agree that there must have been surplus collection during the winter. But the demand for blood remains almost the same throughout the year. If there was better coordination between blood banks and a proper disbursal system was in place, 800 units would not have been was-ted. Now people like us who work for blood donation movements have a lot of explaining to do to the donors,” said D Ashish. general secretary of Medical Bank.
 
 None from the bank was available for comment.
