Madurai: Union minister for defence, Nirmala Sitharaman, who conducted review meetings in the city on Thursday said the villages which had been identified as backward in Ramanathapuram and   districts in the review meeting held in January this year, have made good progress after the implementation of many government schemes and they would become developed districts by 2022.

 She spoke to reporters after reviewing the activities carried out under the India Mission 2022 programme in 36 villages in Virudhunagar. The minister said all steps had been taken to ensure that these villages had 100% implementation of the seven specific schemes of the central government before May 5.
 
 “When I visited the two districts in January, I found that many of these villages lacked facilities and had different issues and no steps are being taken to ensure that they are overcome the problems,” she said. 
 
 It was found that Thiruchuzhi and Narikudi had health and education issues. The educational assessment showed that though the children attended school, their learning was not up to the mark. Now, this had been rectified through special enhancement measures. In the health sector too, locals were being identified to work in these villages to ensure that the villagers had access to health benefits.
 
 The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was being implemented in the villages and a dashboard had been created to assess the implementation of the seven schemes including the Pradhan Mantiri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and Saubhagya Ujala scheme among others. Health and education, apart from basic amenities like roads and water facilities, were the main focus in the aspirational districts development programme.
 
 Sitharaman visited Maroothu and Kottanatham villages in the district, interacted with the people and distributed welfare kits.
