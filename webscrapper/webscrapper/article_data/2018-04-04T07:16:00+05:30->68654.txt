GURUGRAM: A 32-year-old Delhi resident, Anuj Shukla, was robbed of Rs 3,000 in cash, his mobile phone and five ATM cards near   by four youths who offered him a lift in a Maruti Swift Dzire on Saturday. 

 The accused roamed around with Shukla for around an hour before letting him go near Hero Honda Chowk. Shukla managed to call up customer care with a passerby’s phone and get the cards blocked, but Rs 4,500 had already been withdrawn by then.
 
 “I flagged the car and asked the driver if he would drop me to Anand Vihar. He agreed. There was a man sitting at front, who I thought was another passenger. After a while, the driver picked up two more men. They snatched my wallet and phone, thrashed me and made me reveal the card PINs. The man sitting in front noted it down on a piece of paper. One of the ATM cards belonged to my mother-in-law, who they called up for its PIN,” Shukla told police. 
 
 An FIR was registered against four accused under sections 379B (snatching and use of force) and 34 (common intent) of IPC at Sector 18 police station.
 
 “We’ve found   footage from ATMs at a petrol pump near Guru Dronacharya metro station,   mall and a liquor store in Sohna. We’re getting them identified,” said ASI Devi Charan, the investigating officer.
