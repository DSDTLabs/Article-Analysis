 is called forward and the rest of the men wish him 'Good Luck'. He goes for the test with wife  , and the latter shies while standing in front of everyone.
 
    tells   that since none of the stones turned black, they should now end their test here and not test his stone. Just then   asks him what he is afraid and not getting it done.
  
  Daya insists Jetha on getting it done as she wants to get happy like the others on seeing the stone change its color. He agrees and gives the locket to Ratnavali, just then the latter realizes that her spray has finished. This gives a boost to Jetha's morale. Ratnavali tells him that she has another spray of herself.
  
  As soon as she sprays liquid on the locket, it turns black, sending everyone in shock.
  
  Everyone asks her to do the test again, but she tells everyone that her stones cannot lie to her. They all come out in support of Jetha and Ratnavali lashes out at them saying this happens in all the cases in which the stone turns black.
  
  Jethalal tries to prove his point but Ratnavali is not ready to listen.
