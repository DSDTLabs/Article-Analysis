NEW DELHI: The   on Friday wrapped up hearings into a batch of petitions challenging AAP government’s notification with neighbourhood as a criterion for nursery admissions in private unaided schools.

 The court, which heard two association of schools, section of parents, and the government for nearly a month, indicated it will deliver the verdict before the last date for submission of the forms, which is February 14.
 
 “I do not want the kids’ rights to be affected adversely. As the parents will need some time to decide after my judgment, I do not want to derail the process. I do not want anyone to be harmed,” the judge observed while reserving for orders.
 
 “This was an unprecedented hearing as I started hearing the issue without calling for the counter affidavits from the parties against whose decision these petitions were filed,” Justice Manmohan reminded all stakeholders as they pressed him for a judgment.
 
 Petitioners have challenged Delhi government’s December 19, 2016 and January 7 notifications that made 298 private schools, built on DDA land, accept   forms based only on the  . The school groups have alleged that the government “discriminated” among schools as the neighbourhood criteria has been applied against only 298 schools, while it has not been made mandatory for the other 1,400 in the city.
 
 The government, however, defended its decision, saying that a perusal of the allotment letter “clearly and explicitly shows that lessee school had willingly accepted the terms of allotment and on the same very terms of allotment, the lessee has been enjoying the property since time of allotment.”
