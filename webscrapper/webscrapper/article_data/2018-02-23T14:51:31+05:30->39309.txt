NAGPUR: Physiotherapist or occupational   as well as the surgeon play an equally important role in repairing an injury and making the affected part functional. Hence, even as   must consider the therapists at par with themselves, both should respect each other mutually. But the truth is that neither surgeons nor therapists respect each other as much as they should.

 Shrikant Chinchalkar, an occupational therapist from Ontario,   asserted this during an interview with the TOI. He was in city to attend a two-day conference organized to mark the diamond jubilee of the   at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). He happens to be the alumnus of the school.
 
 Chinchalkar stressed that the therapists need to assert themselves, make themselves visible by participating in the surgeons’ conferences etc to make surgeons realize their importance. “I have managed to earn the name only because I was very aggressive in making myself visible,” he said.
 
 Being an expert in upper limb rehabilitation, Chinchalkar has developed number of devices to hasten the rehabilitation process and allowing the person to go back to normal work. In fact, his popularity and dedication in work has earned him recognition in not just Canada but also in UK. A very prestigious fellowship on upper limb has been named after him. He is also known for designing and implementing special programmes for limb rehabilitation from time to time based on his ability to modify the rehabilitation devices and process in coordination with the surgeons.
 
 In last decade or so, a new technique of re-positioning the nerves in the body to strengthen the muscles and their coordination with other parts of the body by surgeons has made the things easier for therapists. Yet Chinchalkar says that therapists need to keep themselves abreast with developments in world.
 
 Chinchalkar plans to come twice to Nagpur annually to help the GMCH and other therapist train themselves in the field.
