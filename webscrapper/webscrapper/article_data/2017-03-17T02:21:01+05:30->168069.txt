NEW DELHI: JNU’s Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment (GSCASH) has strongly denied the rumours that a girl student had filed a sexual harassment complaint against JNU student J Muthukrishnan who recently committed suicide. It also condemned “the attempts to malign the departed student”. 

 A press statement issued by the   called the news “false information”. A senior official said they had no idea of any such complaint. Several fellow students also rebuked the idea of him being involved in the act of sexual harassment. “He was not the kind of person who would do something like this,” said a friend who was also with Muthukrishnan at Hyderabad Central  .
 
 Certain sections of the media have carried that Muthukrishnan was courting a senior girl from his department and was depressed by her non-response. “It may be a reason for his depression,” said a student.
 
 Another friend, however, said she had never heard him talking about such things. “We regularly met at dhabas but he never said he was depressed by anything in his life. He was a jovial person and it is shocking to think that he would commit suicide,” she said.
