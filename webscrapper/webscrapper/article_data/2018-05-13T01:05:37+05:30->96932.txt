NEW DELHI: Malti rouses herself every morning at 4 and goes out foraging for saleable trash in her neighbourhood in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri. Mostly she returns with plastic bottles she picks up from the roads and drains. By 8am, she is back home after selling the day’s collection, which usually amounts to Rs 250. She works to ensure she has money for her son's school fees. He studies in Class V and does not know how his mother earns money. 

 Malti’s struggles reflect the challenges   mothers face in the capital’s  . Now 35 years old, she was not always a rag picker. It was her marriage to an itinerant labourer that forced her into her daily search for recyclables in the slum where they live. “I pay Rs 1,000 as my son’s school fees every month, plus Rs 500 for extra tuitions,” the unlettered Malti said. She plans to move him to a government school next year. “I wanted him to study in a private school to ensure a strong foundation,” she explained. 
 
 Unwilling to tolerate the abusive marriage, Malti decided to ask for a divorce. A voluntary organisation helped her with the legal process, she disclosed. All that she can say at the moment is, “I wish the government had some work opportunities for women in my situation so they can aspire to a life of dignity.” Single women — widows, divorcees and separated — are entitled to special pensions in Delhi. But Malti is not getting it. 
 
 While Malti has no access to financial benefits despite having legal documents like her divorce decree, women like Nusrat, whose husband left her many years ago, are still trying to figure out what rights they have as single mothers. Nusrat, who lives in Jawahar Mohalla in Shashi Garden in east Delhi, especially frets about her 18-year-old disabled son who, unable to cope with the bullying, dropped out from school.
 
 These women are not alone. A study by the   and the Institute of Human Development across 17 urban poor settlements in the capital highlighted critical concerns about single women who are also primary bread winners in marginalised communities. In the three districts of North- east, East and Shahdara, the study showed that of the 3,004 households there, 1,094 (36%) were headed by women, of whom 860 (79%) (860) were widows, 21 (2%) had been deserted by their husbands and 34 (3%) were single. Of the widows, 269 (31%) were not receiving widow pension.
 
 As many as 1,880 households wanted their children to be educated. But of the 3,914 children surveyed, a significant 1,086 were school dropouts. There were 64 children aged between 6 and 17 years among 444 persons with disabilities; 24 of these kids had never been enrolled in schools. In terms of people, of the 14,339 respondents, 6,777 (42.6 %) accorded the highest priority to education.
 
 The number of respondents reporting varied illnesses was 3,927, of whom 639 were children aged less than 1 to 17 years. Another 2,669 reported repeated bouts of cough and cold. Of the 444 persons with disabilities, 268 had disability certificates and availed pensions, but 176 of them did not have the documents to enable their access to benefit schemes.
