NEW DELHI: Was the probe in the 2005 serial blasts case conducted in a hurry? Anti-terror investigators—many of whom are not from the investigating team—TOI spoke to on Friday thought that the case would have had a different ending had the police got more time to follow suspects before going for arrests. 

 The officers also said   back then was inexperienced in handling terror cases. By global standards, it stood nowhere when it came to evidence gathering and filing watertight cases, they said. “It was only after the   encounter in 2008 that the Special Cell pulled up its socks to conduct investigations in a manner in which a court of law would approve of,” said an officer. 
 
 After drawing flak for the encounter, anti-terror policemen were provided extensive training in writing chargesheets, maintaining case dairies, seizure memos and movement logs, and prioritising forensic experts’ role. The cell was also made to train with agencies like Mossad and CIA. 
 
 “Look at chargesheets filed recently and before 2008. The recent ones spell out every detail,” said another officer. 
 
 Policemen recalled how at the time of the attack, the then Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, was away in Agartala but had returned urgently and was at the spot by night.
 
 In a meeting attended by all intelligence agencies, the officers were virtually given an ultimate to solve the case in a time-bound manner. But there was no pressure. “The police did the best possible investigation. We have proved the terror funding that happened in that blast. We respect the judgment but are not satisfied with it. We are waiting for the certified copy after which we will take a decision,” said a cell officer.
