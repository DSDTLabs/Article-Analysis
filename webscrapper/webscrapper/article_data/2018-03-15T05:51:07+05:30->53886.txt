NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday mandated that only a postgraduate in   or imaging techniques could be allowed to conduct  , staying the Delhi HC’s order which had quashed the Centre’s rule prescribing qualification for conducting such tests.

 The HC had ruled that Section 2(p) of the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, defining a sonologist or imaging specialist as a person possessing postgraduate qualification in ultra-sonography or imaging techniques, was bad because there was no such qualification recognised by MCI and the Act did not empower the statutory bodies to devise and coin new qualification.
 
 A CJI-led bench said   had conferred rule-making authority upon the Centre to specify minimum qualification for persons to be employed for conducting the tests and the HC was not right in interpreting the law.
 
 “Parliament which has the unquestioned authority and legislative competence to frame the law considered it necessary to empower the Central government to frame rules to govern the qualifications of persons employed in genetic counselling centres, laboratories and clinics. The wisdom of the legislature in adopting the policy cannot be substituted by the court in the exercise of the power of judicial review,” the bench said. TNN
