BENGALURU: The   community’s demand for a minority-status tag received a big boost on Friday with a seven-member expert committee recommending to the Karnataka government to consider their plea.

 The government had formed the panel to study the proposal for granting the minority status to Lingayats. The panel, headed by former Karnataka high court judge HN Nagamohan Das, has reportedly made the suggestion that the community’s plea is justified on the grounds that Lingayat religion is different from Hindu religion.
 
 Sources said the government was likely to consider the report as it’s among the pre-poll strategies of the   to divide the large Lingayat vote bank — traditionally enjoyed by the   — in its favour in the upcoming assembly polls due in April-May.
 
 The 12
  -century social reformer,  , founded the Lingayat community, which had distanced itself from Hindu Veerashaivas as they followed the Vedas and supported the caste system.
 
 Centuries later, Lingayat and Veerashaiva groups merged on the common thread that both worshipped Shiva.
