KANKUMBI: Nearly two weeks after TOI exclusively reported how   had blocked the Mhadei   flow into Goa, on Wednesday, Karnataka removed the mud embankment. The state acting on the news report took objections to the work carried out by Karnataka on the Kalsa canal in Kankumbi.

 State water resources development officials visited the Kalsa Bhandura project site on Wednesday and found 75% of the mud embankment raised at the confluence of the Kalsa’s tributaries, Aambyacho Vhal and Fanasachya Malichi Nhay, removed.
 
 “But, this has not resumed flow of the Kalsa’s tributaries,” superintending engineer Shrikant Patil told TOI.
 
 After TOI published the report on the blocking of the   water, Goa WRD minister Vinod Palyekar had visited the site on January 13.
 
  In the wake of the vociferous protest that broke out in Goa, Karnataka immediately removed all machinery from the Kalsa project site.
 
 Accompanied with photographic evidence and an affidavit by WRD official Mario Rebello, Goa government filed an interlocutory application before the Supreme Court on Friday, challenging the construction of a canal by Karnataka to divert the Kalsa tributary at Kankumbi, near its border.
 
 On August 17, 2017, counsel for Karnataka told the Supreme Court that work on the Kalsa Bhandura project had been stopped and that no further construction would be carried out. However, post-monsoon, Karnataka gradually resumed work on the project, which gained momentum by December 2017.
 
 “Excavation work carried out by Karnataka in our survey no. 144 has created numerous problems for us. Compensation paid is meagre compared to the losses we have suffered. Presently, work had been stopped by Karnataka, but it has not reinstated the natural flow of water going in the direction of Goa,” said 65-year-old Kankumbi local  .
 
 On previous occasions, despite repeated assurances, Karnataka has resumed work on the Kalsa diversion project.
