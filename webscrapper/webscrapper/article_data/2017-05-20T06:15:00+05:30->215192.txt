 Ignoring the order issued by the previous GB Nagar district magistrate (DM), who had sought that a committee be formed in all the private schools of Gautam Budh Nagar consisting of a parent representative, a chartered accountant (CA) from the parents’ side, a representative of the school, their CA and a representative of the DM/DIOS, the new DM, B N Singh, had sought on May 2 complaints from the parents against the schools within three days.
 
 Following this development, the complaints were supposed to be forwarded to the schools, which were given 10 days to reply. When the date for submission of complaints lapsed on May 5, the complaints were promptly forwarded to the schools by post. However, none of the schools have replied so far and four of them have sought more time to reply from the DIOS.
 
 Dissatisfied, the parents came outside the DM camp office in Noida’s Sector 27 and raised slogans against the administration. They then joined a major protest at the DM office in Surajpur by various social groups of the district to demand a fee regulatory body.
 
 The DM, Singh, told TOI, “The state government has formed a nine-member panel to study the issue. It is going to study the fee hike issue. We will forward our report to the government after receiving all the replies from the schools.”
 
 Singh said that parents sought a stay on fee collection till the issue was resolved.
 
 A group of representatives from the All Noida Schools Parents Association met the DM, seeking action against the schools for not replying within the stipulated time but returned dissatisfied, saying that the DM seems to have “thrown up his hands”.
 
 Calling schools’ reaction “eyewash”, the parents said that the schools were buying time as most of them would declare summer vacation from next week.
