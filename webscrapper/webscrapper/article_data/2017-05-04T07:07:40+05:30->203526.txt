KOTTAYAM: The Kerala   (M)-CPM tie-up in   district panchayat has caused administrative crisis in over 50   in Central Travancore. These local bodies are currently ruled by the Congress-Kerala Congress (M) combine. In all these places, a contract has been made regarding each party sharing the rule for five years equally. 

 In the 22 grama panchayats in Kottayam district, Kerala Congress (M) holds the president post in 10 panchayats and Congress in 12 places with mutual support. In the five block panchayats, Congress is in power in three and KC (M) in two based on a contract between the two parties. In Changanassery and Ettumanur municipalities, Congress chairmen are ruling with KC (M) support.
 
 However, in the new circumstances, there will be a change in the power in these local bodies if either of the political parties withdraw support.
 
 Cracks appeared in the tie-up between the parties once   announced severing ties with the UDF in the Charalkunnu meeting in August last year. The relation further worsened when KC (M) fielded their candidates in Mutholi and Moonnilavu panchayat bypolls in Kottayam district and recorded huge wins.
 
 Also, the return of Mani into the UDF fold is considered as next to impossible following the Kottayam development. 
 
 This will naturally call off the cooperation at the local body level also. The reactions from the Congress leaders also assert this possibility.
