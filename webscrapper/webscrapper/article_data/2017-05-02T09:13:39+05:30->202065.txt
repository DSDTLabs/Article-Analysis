 of Rs 2,500 in the heart of the city , sounds like an   But in the time of skyrocketing   and muti-storey buildings, the state's almost 70-year-old policy of providing houses under the public quota stands as a reminder of another era.

 The City Improvement Trust (CIT) was a small organisation formed in 1947 to cater to the housing needs of Madras. The CIT logo marks these houses in several parts of the city . The well-known Nandanam arch off Anna Salai is one such gateway marking the colony of houses in the area. The letters CIT are painted on the structure and a few steps ahead lies a row of single-storey houses in Lotus Colony all embossed with the same logo. Having a similar structure these single-storey houses, although small in size, have ample space around the compound area.
 
 A former housing board official recalled these houses were always allotted at reasonable rates. “The housing board wanted to upgrade it to Rs 5 but later set it at Rs 2.50 per sqft that continues till today . There are at least 250 such houses spread across the city ,“ said the official. CIT later became   Housing Board.
 
 The residents now pay a rent of Rs 2,000-Rs 2,500 for the houses, which have certain clauses like no construction is allowed over the existing structure. “It has to remain single storey and we cannot change any exterior aspect of the house. However, we can renovate the interiors. If there is a complaint about the house, we have to write a letter to the housing board,“ said Nagaraj, a occupant of a CIT house.
 
 A senior retired   said these houses may have mushroomed between the late 1940s and 60s in different parts of the city and were allotted under the public quota by the government in power.Around 2007, there was a proposal to demolish them and build   but this wasn't implemented.
