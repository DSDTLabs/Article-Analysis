New Delhi: Disability rights activists protested outside   on Monday demanding that   be reinstated as the director of public relations. The protesters also sought action against DDA vice-chairman   for discriminating against a disabled man. 

 TOI had recently reported that DDA had repatriated Bhati to his parent department citing his disability as the reason. But after a media outcry, the land-owning agency offered to take him back. 
 
 Several people under the banner of   said this incident was a test case for the central government, which had recently passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
 
 “We have written to Prime minister Narendra Modi about it. The letter has been sent to the urban development minister, lieutenant governor, etc. Now we have to see what the government does. We expect strict action so that this is not repeated,” said Javed Abidi, convener of Disabled Rights Group.
 
 There were many who related to Bhati’s experience. Suarna Raj (34), one of the protesters, said that many government offices aren’t disabled-friendly. “When I was working with Rastriya Mahila Kosh, I found it difficult to climb up the stairs as I am wheelchair-bound. I pleaded them to build a ramp but was refused,” said Suarna.
 
 Following the protest, a delegation headed by Abidi met Singh. “We told him that DDA has discriminated against Bhati. We were assured that DDA will issue an unqualified apology and every effort will be made to get him back,” said Abidi.
 
 According to a DDA official, “We have called Bhati and requested him to join back. There was some communication gap. We wholeheartedly welcome him.”
 
 Bhati confirmed that he had received a call from DDA, but is yet to decide whether to go back or not.
