LUCKNOW: From the new academic session,   will accept   only online. All department heads will have to upload practical   marks on the day it is held, using the teacher's login facility. The 162 affiliated colleges of the university will have to update marks using the college login. 

 The idea is to expedite semester results and bring about greater transparency in awarding internal marks.
 
 "Till now, the scoresheet of internal marks was sent by colleges manually. Due to delay in sending marks, not only was   declaration delayed but there were also complaints that marks were allegedly increased by the faculty after finding that theory examination was tough or less scoring," said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. 
 
 He said the university data resource centre had made the university professor and college login available.
