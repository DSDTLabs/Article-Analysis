HYDERABAD: Kashmir needs healing and a descendant of the Moghul dynasty who lives in Hyderabad is offering a healing touch. `Prince'  , the great grandson of the last Moghul emperor  , will travel for six days in Jammu and Kashmir from May 20 to 25, hold public meetings and more importantly gather 
Muslim scholars and address them.
 
 A meeting with J&K chief minister   and governor NN Vohra is also scheduled, which Tucy said was being arranged by the PMO. 
 
 “I am in touch with the PMO on my mission to J&K,“ Tucy told TOI when asked if his plans to travel in Kashmir and hold meetings in sensitive areas has been cleared.
 
 “The J&K police will provide me security,“ he said. Tucy maintains a low profile in Hyde rabad and confines himself to carrying out social activities. He has also kept himself away from politics in what appears to be a conscious decision. 
 
 After having studied in New Science College at Narayanaguda, Tucy went to Saudi Arabia where he was employed with Saudi Arabian Airlines for nearly nine years. The airline had sent him to the UK for training in ae ronautical engineering. He has set up some businesses in Hyderabad and he said he was financially sound because of them.
 
 “There are two to three lakh Moghul descendant families in Rajouri and Poonch. We have a responsibility towards ensuring peace in our country. We cannot allow our people to be either influenced by Pakistan or become tools in its hands,“ Tucy said. 
 
 Tucy had visited J&K some three months ago and studied the situation there. “There are misled youth who are indulging in stone-pelting. Our ulema should play a more responsible role and ensure that the youth are not misguided,“ Tucy said.
