NEW DELHI: Ahead of Bangladesh’s first Test match on Indian soil, we take a look back at the team’s eight victories in the five-day format since their debut in 2000. 

 
 
 
 Bangladesh’s first Test victory came after 34 previous matches. The setting was Chittagong’s MA Aziz Stadium, where Zimbabwe were beaten by 226 runs. A first-innings total of 488 put the hosts on course for the win, with skipper   (94),   (89),   (69) and   (56) scoring fifties. Zimbabwe replied with 312, Rafique the most successful bowler with 5/65 in 41.4 staggering overs, and despite making just 204 in their second innings,   were able to complete a big victory. On the final day, the star was left-arm spinner Enamul Hague junior, aged 18, with five wickets in 16.2 overs as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 154. Bashar termed the win as the best day of his life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the summer of 2009, Bangladesh went to the Caribbean and played a depleted West Indies team owing to a contracts row. They went up 1-0 with a 95-run win in St Vincent, one headlined by their spinners. A middling first-innings total of 238 was followed by Bangladesh conceding a lead of 69, but the success of Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah with the ball was a portent of things to come. Tamil Iqbal’s 128 was the catalyst for a total of 345, which set West Indies a target of 277. They were all out for 181, with Shakib netting three and Mahmudullah five. It was viewed as a historic win. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Bangladesh’s third Test victory came in the next match as West Indies were beaten 2-0. Once again the spinners dominated, with Enamul, Shakib and Mahmudullah taking three each to bowl West Indies out for 237. Some superb bowling from Kemar Roach (6/48) limited Bangladesh to 232, but after the home team folded for 209 - Shakib claimed 5/70 - the stage was set for Bangladesh to chase history. They overhauled their target of 215 for the loss of six wickets, with Shakib not out on 96 off 97 deliveries. He was named Man of the Match and Man of the Series.
 
 
 
 
 A win in the second Test in Harare meant the series was drawn 1-1. Bangladesh made 391 and 291, with the rookie Nasir Hossain making 77 and 67 not out and skipper Mushfiqur Rahim 60 and 93. Zimbabwe’s batsmen struggled against Bangladesh’s bowling, as totals of 282 and 257 show. Robiul Islam’s 5/85 and 4/59 from Sohag Gazi in Zimbabwe’s first innings were big factors in the win. 
 
 
 
 A narrow win for the hosts to go up 1-0 in the series at home. After two even first innings from both teams, the decisive blows were landed to Zimbabwe when they batted again, as they lost all ten wickets on the third day. Seven of those fell in the morning session and Zimbabwe were bowled out for 114 in 35.5 overs, with Taijul Islam snaring 8/39. Bangladesh lost three without a run scored when chasing 102, but a series of cameos eventually hauled them across the line. Taijul was there at the end with 15 not out and was a shoo-in for Man of the Match. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 The series was sealed a match later. Centuries to Tamim (109) and Shakib (137) contributed to a total of 433, after which Shakib took five wickets as Zimbabwe were kept to 368. A declaration at 248/9 set the visitors a target of 314 but they got as far as 151, with Shakib taking five more to join Ian Botham and Imran Khan as the only players to score a century and take ten wickets in a Test. 
 
 
 
 
 Bangladesh made it a clean 3-0 by crushing Zimbabwe in the last match in Chittagong. The formula was replayed: Tamim (130) and Imrul Kayes (130) put on a record opening stand of 224 to put the team on course for a total of 503; legspinner Jubair Hossain took five to keep Zimbabwe to 374; then Mominul Haque hit an unbeaten 131 and Bangladesh declared at 319/5. Set 449, Zimbabwe ended on 262 with Bangladesh’s bowlers sharing the wickets - well, not Shakib, who for once went wicketless.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Bangladesh’s biggest Test win, coming as it did against a full-strength England team. And it mean the series was shared 1-1. On a slow and low track assisting spin, a first-innings 104 off 147 balls from Tamim, in a total of 220, proved massive in the final outcome, but it was the 19-year-old spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz who was Man of the Match (and series) for his remarkable bowling. In his second Test, the rookie took 6/82 to keep England to 244 and then six more to trigger a stunning collapse of ten wickets in 22.3 overs during what proved the final session of the match.
