Ahmedabad: The accused of Khodiarnagar bomb case were preparing to plant another bomb at Kanesar village in Jasdan taluka. This time their target was to be the relatives of one of the accused, Praveen Solanki. The relatives had allegedly denied Solanki a share in their ancestral land in Kanesar village.

 Sources in city crime branch claimed that Dinesh Ginoya, a key accused who is still on the run, had promised Solanki that a bomb would be planted in front of Dalpat’s Vyas house in Khodiyarnagar of Rajkot. This was to be in return for the help Solanki had given in making the bomb.
 
 “Solanki used to work in a quarry. He had helped Dinesh, Ranjan alias Anju Rathod, and other accused obtain gelatin sticks for making the bomb,” said a senior police official. “The accused had thought the police would probe a terror angle and not come after them. They thought they were committing the perfect crime in guise of a terror attack.”
 
 Police are also worried that the Khodiyarnagar bomb incident may trigger a new trend of killing people with bombs to settle scores.
 
 “During interrogation, Praveen confessed that if the Khodiyarnagar bomb plan had succeeded, they planned to cause similar blasts in Kanesar village to avenge the denial of share in ancestral land,” a police officer said.
 
 Police said Ranjan Rathod had roped in her two sons, Jaideep and Vikram alias Vikki, and her lover Dinesh to make a bomb and place it outside Dalpat’s house.
 
 “Dalpat, Nitin Bava and Munna Bawa had forcibly taken possession of Ranjan’s house as she could not repay the loan of Rs 50,000 she had taken from Nitin Bava,” a crime branch officer said.
