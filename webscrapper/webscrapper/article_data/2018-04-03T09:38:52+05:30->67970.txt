NEW DELHI:   Doodle today paid a tribute to Indian freedom fighter and feminist social reformer   on her 115th birth anniversary.

 
 The colourful doodle celebrates Kamaladevi's multi-faceted accomplishments and her immense contribution in enriching India's cultural and social fabric.
 
  
  
 
 Widely-known for persuading Mahatma Gandhi to call upon women to participate in civil disobedience movements during India's freedom struggle, Kamaladevi is among the handful of women who championed the rights of the fairer sex at that time. 
 
 She propounded that civil rights, religious freedoms, and political independence were all inter-related issues and worked relentlessly for the upliftment of women. She pioneered the cooperative movement which helped raise the socio-economic status of women around the country.
 
 Born on April 3, 1903 in Mangalore (now Mangaluru), Kamaladevi was married at the age of 14 and was widowed two years later. She then traveled to London to further her education and after her return to India, joined the   in 1927.
 
 Her career was one of many firsts -- from being the first woman to be arrested by the British for selling contraband salt, to becoming the first woman to run for Legislative office. She was among the chosen few national leaders who had the privilege of signing the new Constitution of India document after Independence.
 
 Dubbed as the "culture queen of India", Kamaladevi is credited as the driving force behind the renaissance of Indian handicrafts, handlooms and theatre in the post-independence era.
 
 She went on to set up the famous theatre institute National School of Drama, Sangeet Natak Akademi, Central Cottage Industries Emporium, and the Crafts Council of India.
 
 Kamaladevi is also the recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama.
 
 She passed away on October 29, 1988 at the age of 85.
