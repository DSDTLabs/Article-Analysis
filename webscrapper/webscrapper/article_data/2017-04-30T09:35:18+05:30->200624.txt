PUNE: Several citizens have had to accept the same   bills twice thanks to the   ( ) facing a ‘technical fault’. 

 Residents have received the bills despite having paid the tax amount. 
 
 For their part, the civic administration has clarified that additional bills were being dispatched to properties due to a technical fault and the issue will be sorted out on priority.
 
 To avoid further confusion, the administration has appealed citizens, who have received two bills, to approach the nearest zonal offices and rectify the error. The civic administration has also uploaded the application form on its website. 
 
 Head of PMC’s property   Suhas Mapari said that citizens needn’t panic. “The civic body isn’t asking property owners to pay the tax twice. The administration is initiating steps to cancel the additional bills. The process will take some time but it will end the confusion,” Mapari said. 
 
 Starting this week, the administration has initiated a drive to help citizens cancel the additional dispatched bill. The drive will continue until May 31. 
 
 The team includes officials from the computer department as well as inspectors from the zonal offices, who are assisting tax payers in cancelling the additional bills. 
 
 Meanwhile, officials have stated that the property tax department did not have the exact number of properties that were issued bills more than once. They said the situation would be clear only after the drive ends in about a month. 
 
 The property tax department has listed over 8 lakh properties across the city. The property owners can avail discount of 2% if the tax is paid before May 31. The department has said that since the process of cancellation of additional bills is rather lengthy, owners should approach the department at the earliest.
