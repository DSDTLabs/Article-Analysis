PATNA: Unicef’s India representative Dr Yasmin Ali Haque has hailed the Bihar government’s campaign against the menace of dowry and child marriages and hoped the noble initiative would strike a severe blow to the social evils.

  has partnered with the state for the campaign that was launched by CM Nitish Kumar on the Gandhi Jayanti on Monday. 
 
 “The most important aspect of the campaign is the political will and commitment, and it is not about a political statement but a system-strengthening approach to tackle the problem,” she said.
 
 The rate of child marriages has come down from 60% to 39% in the state during the last decade. “With the government now making a fresh initiative, we should see a steep decline in the data on child marriage in 2019,” the Unicef official told this reporter on Tuesday. 
 
 According to her, early marriage betrays how poorly the society values its girl. “It is one of the root causes for malnutrition of mothers and newborns. Global studies show it adversely affects the survival and development of the child,” she said.
 
 Stressing the importance of education, Yasmin said the government should think how to bring the education system closer to the girl. “Societal norms should change... The society must respect people who let their children complete their education and who do not give or accept dowry for marriage of their children,” she said.
 
 On Unicef supporting the state government in its Open Defecation Free movement, Yasmin said the challenge was to sustain the movement. “Behavioural change in its people is a must for a society to be freed of open defecation,” she said.
