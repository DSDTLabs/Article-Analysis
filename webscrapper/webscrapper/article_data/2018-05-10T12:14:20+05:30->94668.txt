JAISALMER: A resident of Banton-ki-Dhani under Gudamalani police station of Barmer district has alleged that his minor daughter has been kidnapped by a Muslim boy studying in her class. Both minors study in Class XI. The girl’s family and many Hindu organisations have alleged it to be a case of ‘love jihad’.

 
 Gudamalani SHO   said the case was being investigated. According to Soni, the girl’s father has lodged an FIR saying his daughter had gone to a shop in the afternoon on May 8 but did not return. The complaint says that her Muslim classmate too was missing from around the same time. “The girl’s father has alleged that the boy kidnapped her to forcefully marry her,” said police.
 
 The girl’s father has told police that three persons, Dilawar Khan, Sabir Khan and  , helped the minor boy in kidnapping. Taking a serious note of the incident, Barmer SP Gagandeep Singhla went to Gudamalani police station and took details of the case.
 
 On Monday, a ‘Hindu Aakrosh’ rally was taken out in Barmer city to protest against cases of alleged ‘love jihad’. The protestors had leveled serious allegations against the police and the district administration. Barely two days after the rally the incident was reported to Gudamalani police station.
 
 Bajrang Dal district convener   said that incidents of ‘love jihad’ were increasing in Barmer district because the administration does not know about people coming from outside areas to commit crimes.
