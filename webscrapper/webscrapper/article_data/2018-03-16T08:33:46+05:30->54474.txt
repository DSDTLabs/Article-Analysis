SURAT: Representatives of private consultancy agency appointed by the   (MoUD) conducted surprise checks in Surat for the Swachh Sarveskshan 2018 or   and collected samples from 36 spots including residential localities,  ,  

 During the last official survey visit on February 7-8, inspection was carried out on 92 different places by the team. After completion of spot survey of all 4,032 entrant cities on March 10, this is the final and surprise check round that has been included from this year. 
 
 Surat was ranked fourth in last year’s Swachh Sarvekshan. An official from   (SMC) told TOI, “The surprise check is for the reconfirming the previous status and to get a first-hand account of what was recorded in the city during official and informed visits.” 
 
 Segregation of waste at source and unavailability of ways and means to process organic waste were the major drawbacks for the city last year. These parameters pushed Surat out of the top three. 
 
 “We have improved our condition on both the counts and now, about 50% of our waste is segregated at source. We also have capacity of converting organic waste into manure by up to 700 metric tonne (MT). Large number of small organic waste converter units have done well on the count of pay-and-use toilets and cleanliness around it,” said an SMC official. 
 
 Surat, with over 50 lakh population, generates about 1,800 MT solid waste daily. This waste is dumped in landfill site at Khajod. After the   (NGT) directed the city administration to close the dumping site and reduce its waste quantity, reprocessing of at least 50% of its organic waste has started. 
 
 SMC commissioner M Thennarasan told TOI, “Compared to last year, we have taken large number of steps to keep the city cleaner. Setting up of compost plants at vegetable markets, gardens, segregation of waste and setting up of organic waste converter plants are some of them. We are sure to do better this year.”
