 Data compiled by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) under the ministry of commerce and industry, shows that Karnataka was at the top with 179 investment proposals worth Rs 1,49,847 crore or 39.71% of the total investments proposed in the country in 2017.
 
 Gujarat received industrial entrepreneur memoranda (IEMs) or investment intentions to the tune of Rs 56,156 crore and Rs 64,733 crore in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
 Industry experts say Gujarat has a large number industrial units and they chose the state while expanding their capacity. “The textile policies of the Centre and state government are very good. The Gujarat government also unveiled an encouraging policy for the plastics industry.

 However, the scenario is not as upbeat in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). During the April-September 2017-18 period, Gujarat saw FDI inflows worth US$ 482 million (Rs 3,101 crore), which is higher than US$ 368 million (2,462 crore) in same period last fiscal. Despite one more quarter to go for the current fiscal and with the December quarter figure yet to be made public, experts feel that FDI inflows for all of 2017-18 are expected to be much lower than the FDI attracted in 2016-17. Total FDI in Gujarat was US$ 3,367 million (Rs 22,610 crore) in the previous fiscal.
 
 “Because of the lack of proactive governance in the state, we are losing foreign direct investment to other states. There is a fierce competition among states and Gujarat needs to be proactive in attracting FDI,” said Sunil Parekh, a city-based industrial advisor.
