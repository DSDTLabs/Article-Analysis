Panaji: Differing views were expressed at a seminar on an ‘Independent   for the state of Goa’, by the All India Lawyers Union (AILU) in Panaji on Thursday.

 In the eventuality of an independent High Court being set up in Goa, there should be provisions and perhaps even reservation to enable judges to be appointed from all sections of society, Advocate Albertina Almeida said.
 
 “We need as much diversity in the judiciary as possible. I don’t think those only from certain sections of society have the enabling potential to become judges,” she said.
 
 Advocate Avinash Bhosle stressed the importance for reservation of two seats in the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa.
 
 Former union law minister Ramakant Khalap said the state could be saddled with a mediocre or even corrupt judge for more than a decade if the state has an independent high court while Advocate Anacleto Viegas said this would not be an issue as every judge’s order is subject to a review.
 
 Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar’s absence was discussed during the seminar with adv Radharao Gracias, a former legislator, saying “The state has become an evacuee property. You can’t have a state with the CM so far off,” adding that the state’s executive organ was missing.
 
 “Till date he has not told us how well or how bad he is This is the state of affairs,” Gracias said.
