PANAJI: In a move to boost infrastructure upgradation in   areas, the state government has decided to extend the Deendayal   Raj Infrastructure Development Golden Jubilee Scheme, 2013 by five more years, till March 2022.
 
  Though the scheme had received tepid response during the initial one-year implementation period in 2012-2013 and only 50 panchayats had submitted proposals, the government is hoping to draw more rural bodies into the planning mode. Of the 50 proposals submitted, 19 have been initiated. “These are mostly for construction of panchayat houses with a few having additional facility of community halls,” an official said, adding, “Panchayats can draw up plans for suitable projects of Rs 20 lakh to Rs 2.5 crore. Even a single infrastructure project of Rs 2.5 crore can be sanctioned with prior approval of finance department.”
 
  After the village panchayat chooses the infrastructure project and endorses it through a suitable resolution, the panchayat secretary will have to prepare a proposal and submit it to the executing agency in 30 days. Then, the executing agency will submit it with recommendations to the directorate of panchayats, which in turn will pass it on to the scrutiny and sanctioning committee for consideration.
  
  Panchayat department officials expect to receive proposals for rural infrastructure, like markets, toilets, parks and other facilities and Goa state infrastructure development corporation will be one of the agencies implementing the projects after they are approved by the scrutiny and sanctioning committee.
  
  An allocation of 30% of the cost will be released to the agency within 30 days of receiving the proposal and a second instalment of 40% will be given on submission of utilization certificate of first instalment.
  
  “GSIDC or other executing agency will earmark 10% of funds towards maintenance work for at least 7 years,” an official said.
