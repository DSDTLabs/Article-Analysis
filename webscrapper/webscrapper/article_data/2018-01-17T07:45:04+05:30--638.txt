SALBONI: Forest officials on Tuesday morning rescued a three-month-old elephant calf after she fell into a 10-12 feet deep well off the Jhitka forest adjoining Lalgarh in  . 

 The calf was reunited with her mother and the herd of 70 Dalma elephants at the   forest in West Midnapore.
 
 Around 5am on Tuesday, the herd sneaked into human habitat and raided agricultural land, destroying crops in   near the forest. However, due to thick fog the calf fell into a well, which is a source of water for their fields, dug by farmers.
 
 Hearing the calf's cries from the well, other elephants in the herd too created a din while its mother tried to get it out. After being informed about the incident around 5.30am, forest officials at their Jhitka beat office rushed to the village. A team first chased the rest of the herd into the forest. Then they brought a payloader and dug the earth around the well. The officials then lowered a rope and tied it around the calf to lift it out. Once out, the calf ran towards the forest and rejoined her herd around 8.30am.
 
 DFO Midnapore   said, "We were able to lift the elephant calf within three hours of getting the information. It took a while for our team to chase away the adult elephants in her herd to conduct the rescue operation smoothly. The calf is in good health."
