Miihier Singh,   talks about how his life changed.

 Fitness was always an obsession for me. When you are a bodybuilder your body is your temple and you want to be healthy forever. I was the first Indian to represent our country at the 47th Asian Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship. But after that, I suffered some chest injuries. The setback was physical and emotional. Life is hard, having an injury makes you realise what hardship is all about. 
 
 This injury has made me relook at my life and redefine it. I don’t take things for granted anymore. From lifting the heaviest of weights, I couldn’t even do push ups. The body that gave me so much confidence and fame, was suddenly dysfunctional. I couldn’t play my sport. I felt insecure and eventually became depressed. It was the toughest phase in my life. 
 
 But what it made me realise was that one doesn’t become strong by building a strong body. A strong mind was the only thing that could get me out of that phase. Slowly I started believing in myself. I started making every day count. I told myself, I would be back in international championships again. I started working on my body. It was the toughest phase of my life. I nursed myself back to health with the strength of my mind. Slowly, I started getting back in shape. 
 
 The journey changed my approach to life. Now, I have devoted my life to fitness, not just my own but everyone connected to me. There’s nothing more important than good health. You are what you eat and the result of the workout you do or don’t do.
