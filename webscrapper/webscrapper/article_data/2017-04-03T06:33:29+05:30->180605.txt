JAISALMER: The national level census of the endangered bird species   (godawan) that was to organized from March 19 to March 26 at Pokhran field firing range in Jaisalmer could not take place. Reason: The ongoing tank firing at the range. Due to heavy firing in the range (  exercises), the wildlife teams could not enter the range.

 This time the census remained incomplete and the correct numbers of godawan could not be gathered. Last year, a total of 24 godawans were seen at Pokhran field firing range. Now, efforts will be made again to complete the census of godawan in November this year.
 
 Confirming this,   deputy forest conservator Anoop K R said that the census of wildlife including that of godawan couldnâ€™t be completed between March 19 and March 26. However, even in this incomplete census, a total of 30 godawans were seen.
 
 In all 55 teams saw godawans around 74 times, but since there were many repetitions and looking to this, a total of 30 godawans is considered to the right number. The deputy forest conservator said this time due to Army exercises in the field the census had be left incomplete. He added that last year, out of 40, 24 godawans were seen at the Pokhran field firing range.
 
 He added that in the census of 22,000 sqkm area, Pokhran range which is on 7,000 sqkm area had to be left out. This time census was to be conducted on 16,560 sqkm area which remained imcomplete.
