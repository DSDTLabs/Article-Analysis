PUNE: A Wildlife SOS team and the Junnar forest division on Sunday rescued a six-year old male leopard who had sustained severe injuries in a road accident in Dhavalpuri village on  

 On Sunday afternoon, veterinary officer Ajay Deshmukh of Manidoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar received a call from one Adarsh Reddy about an   that was spotted in Dhavalpuri village.
 
 Forest officials said the wounded leopard had taken refuge in a sugarcane field in the village. “Deshmukh immobilized the leopard using a sedative injection. A thorough on-site veterinary examination revealed that the leopard was paralysed from the hind limbs and had sustained external injuries on the left thigh and the flank area. The leopard is suspected to have been a victim of a highway accident. The rescue mission lasted for almost two hours after which the leopard was carefully transported to a facility in Dhotre for further treatment.”
 
 Deshmukh said, “The wounds on the thigh and flank appear to be 2-3 days old. The leopard is paralysed from waist down and suffering from a tick infestation. Once we conduct an X-ray exam, we will be able to determine the cause and extent of the injury.”
 
 Wildlife SOS co-founder   said, “We suspect that the animal was hit by a speeding vehicle while attempting to cross the highway. A thorough medical evaluation will be conducted soon to confirm the same. With little or no provision for wildlife corridors or underpasses for animals to cross roads safely, many put their lives at risk as they often wander onto the busy highways and end up getting injured or killed.”
 
  Kishan R Agalwe said, “A farmer saw the leopard struggling to make its way into a sugarcane field. He immediately reported the matter. We are working with the   team to ensure the animal receives the best care possible.”
