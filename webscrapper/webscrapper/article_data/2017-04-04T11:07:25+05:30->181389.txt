CALANGUTE: Deputy speaker and   MLA   has urged the Centre to issue the final notification regarding private shacks, restaurants, huts and other structures in the CRZ no-development area.

 Talking to mediapersons at Calangute on Monday morning, Lobo said that the Union ministry for environment and forests had issued a notification on January 6, 2011, allowing seasonal, temporary structures in private properties falling in the CRZ areas, with a rule that all these structures be removed at the end of the season. Stakeholders, who were erecting these seasonal structures, had demanded that the government change the requirement that the structures be completely removed at the end of the season as dismantling and erecting them again at the beginning of the next season leads to a huge expenditure.
 
 “Following this, after I approached the Centre through chief minister  , the Union ministry for environment and forests had issued a draft notification on April 25, 2016, inviting suggestions and objections to a proposal allowing all temporary structures to remain where they are from June to September without being dismantled. I urge the central minister for environment   to issue at the earliest the final notification allowing the temporary structures to remain as they are between June and September,” Lobo said.
 
 A large number of owners of these temporary structures met Lobo at his office on Monday seeking his intervention as the toursit season comes to a close in May and the government would issue an order to remove all temporary structures.
