PATNA: The state   on Saturday termed the party’s victory in Tripura and Nagaland assembly elections as one more step towards creating a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’. They also congratulated PM   and party president   for the spectacular wins in the two northeastern states.

 State BJP chief Nityanand Rai, Union minister   and other functionaries joined the party workers to celebrate the victory. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav and health minister Mangal Pandey also hailed the PM-Shah duo for the party’s victory. Party spokesmen Rajib Ranjan and Sanjay Singh Tiger, both former MLAs, termed the victory a “rehearsal for the 2019 parliamentary elections”.
 
 Taking a swipe at   president Rahul Gandhi, Giriraj said, “I wonder why the Congressmen chose him as their party president. He has gone to Italy to celebrate Holi, leaving the Congress alone in its defeat!”
 
 Health minister Pandey said election results in northeastern states would dash the “dreams of building yet another grand alliance” in Bihar by RJD national president Lalu Prasad and leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.
 
 Meanwhile, the fall of CPM government in Tripura after 25 years has left the Bihar Left parties in a state of utter disbelief. They felt that the ‘PM-Shah duo’ had used every card, both within book and outside it, to organise stunning victory of the BJP. The feeling in the non-CPM Left parties was that the CPM leadership should shed its anti-Congress hard line and opt for a broader alliance of the Left, democratic and secular parties to defeat the BJP.
