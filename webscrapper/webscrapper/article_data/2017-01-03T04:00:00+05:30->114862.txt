Chennai: This New Year,   are set to report a spike in   for the  . For the industry, observers peg the loss at Rs 3,000 crore a day.

 With no transaction fee from ATMs and waiver on debit and credit charges, banks lost a substantial portion of their non-interest income in the month of November and December. 
 
 Apart from which, credit activity declined nearly 70% despite a low interest rate environment. Banks flush with CASA deposits had a new source of cheaper funds and higher liquidity. “But these funds don't act in the same fashion as term deposits. Since the deposits were forced, once withdrawal limits are eased, customers will be free to withdraw all their deposits in savings and current accounts,” said Vishwas Tyagi, vice president, All India Bank Employees Association. 
 
 “MCLR rates have come down and loans are being offered at cheaper interest rates. But there hasn't been an increase in credit activity, because bankers did not have the time. Cash transactions and deposits took the lion’s share of activities leaving little or no time for credit growth, loan recovery or normal banking transactions.”
 
 Higher operating costs will prove to be another dampener for bank earnings in the second quarter. “We incurred higher costs this quarter because of the intense activity around demonetisation,” said K Venkataraman, CEO, Karur Vysya Bank.
 
 In the first two weeks, banks were kept open for as long as 13-15 hours a day. There was also an increase in operations as banks had to remove all the withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from ATMs. All the machines then had to be recaliberated for the new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. After which because of the scarcity in cash ATMs were being filled to 1/10th their capacity.
