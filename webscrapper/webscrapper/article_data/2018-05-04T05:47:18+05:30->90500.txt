CHENNAI: The design of Chennai airport’s new integrated terminal released on Thursday, shows efficient and judicious use of mezzanine floor to enhance the aesthetics and usable floor space of the building. The better use of vertical space between the floor and the roof increases passenger experience. And this is a lesson learned from construction of the two steel and glass terminals which are being used now as domestic and international terminals.

 
 The new terminal, spread over 3,36,000sqm, will be built at the location where the old and unused   and the   stand.
 
 The presence of a broader mezzanine level will mean the new integrated terminal will have high ceilings in the check-in and boarding areas, and the rest of the areas like security check and immigration will have a low ceiling .
 
 “The space above can also be used for lounges and other facilities. There is no need to leave a vast expanse of vertical space unused as is the case with the current terminals,” said an official.
 
 Airline lounges will be located on the mezzanine level.
 
 More space will be devoted to the check-in area. Passengers who enter the departure terminal will be able to check-in at the islands or at a row of counters that will be located throughout the length of the terminal. There are no island check in counters in the existing terminals due to shortage of space.
 
 Opened in 2013, the existing terminals were a big maintenance challenge for  . The roof truss was left bare without a false ceiling, leaving gaps for monkeys and doves to enter the departure hall. A number of glass panels were shattered as maintaining optimum temperature turned out to be difficult because of the open space.
