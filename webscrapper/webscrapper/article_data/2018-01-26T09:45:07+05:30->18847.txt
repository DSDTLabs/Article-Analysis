NEW DELHI. Former CM of Jammu & Kashmir   has asked why “Karni Sena goons” aren’t being tied to jeeps and paraded in front of school buses and cinema halls as human shields.

 Abdullah’s remarks came a day after a school bus carrying children in Gurugram was attacked by hooligans who are against the release of the controversial Hindi film ‘Padmaavat’.
 
 Abdullah’s tweet was, of course, in reference to the ‘human shield controversy’ that broke out in Srinagar last year, when an alleged stone-pelter was tied to the bonnet of an Army jeep by an officer who was looking to escape unscathed from an area where protestors had gathered during by-polls.
 
 Abdullah wondered why the same mob control measure that the Indian Army employed in Kashmir wasn’t being followed in other parts of the country.
 
 
  
 In April last year, a video grab showing the incident of the Kashmiri man being tied to a jeep caused lot of anger and shock in Kashmir. Major Nitin Leetul Gogoi, the officer who tied the man to the jeep, was awarded by the Army for his work in counter-insurgency operations.
