HYDERABAD: The   is finding it tough to meet the deadline for   to farmers. This, in turn, is expected to delay the scheme to dole out 4,000 input subsidy to farmers. 

 Chief minister   had earlier fixed March 11 as the deadline. After completion of the land record purification programme in which nearly 2 crore records were verified, the government had entered an MoU with the   of India for printing and delivery of the new pattadar passbooks for the state. But the agreement was cancelled due to issues related to design and price.
 
 As per plans, the passbooks are to have a unique 13-digit identity which will give the precise location of the land along with details of the owners. The technical services department has to provide village-wise data to the printers after obtaining approval from the joint collector of the respective districts. But some villages and mandals have not finalised the list.
 
 "Though the revenue department has been designated as the nodal agency, the agriculture and technical services departments are also trying to expedite the process," said an official in the agriculture department.
