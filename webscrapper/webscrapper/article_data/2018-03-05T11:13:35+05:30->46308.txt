TRICHY: City   is yet to install road signs and speed breakers in more than a dozen newly laid arterial stretches, mostly concentrated in Cantonment locality, in accordance with the parameters devised by   (IRC).

 Since January 2018,   took up 38 road projects covering a part of the city at an estimated cost of Rs 11.6 crores. Though 95 per cent of the road works were completed a couple of weeks ago, road markings including the carriage way and longitudinal marking were not taken up by the civic body.
 
 Even in the presence of road markings, as road sense is a farce among the motorists, absence of road safety parameter would encourage rash driving including overtaking, rued the public. Though the road laying works on Collector Office Road, Royals Road, and Williams Road were completed by Trichy Corporation a couple of weeks ago, the road markings are yet to be taken up by the civic body.
 
 Similarly, speed breakers positioned on Lawsonâ€™s Road and   near MGR roundabout that were removed during road laying works were not replaced. When contacted, official sources with Trichy Corporation assured that the road markings would be laid on the new roads at the earliest.
