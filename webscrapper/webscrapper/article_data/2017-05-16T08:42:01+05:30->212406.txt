Bollywood actor   will soon make his debut on TV with MTV's Big F 2. The latest reports on the actor is that his appearance on the show has been cut short due to the changes in production houses.
 
  It is yet to know that the episodes he has already shot for would be aired or not.
  
    Hooda may not be a part of the future episodes.
  
  
 
  
  A source reveals, “He has shot the episodes that he'd committed to, now it's their choice to air them or not. Randeep will soon get busy with his film Battle of Saragrahi, so it isn't clear whether he will be part of more episodes.“
  
  The channel spokesperson says, “Randeep Hooda is very much a part of MTV Big F and we are extremely happy with the response his association with the show has received. The decision to bring in another production house has nothing to do with Randeep and he will be continuing on as the host of the show.“
