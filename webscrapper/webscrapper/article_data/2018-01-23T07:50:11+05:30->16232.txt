BENGALURU: Just when Bengalureans were getting ready to bundle their woollens into wardrobes, thinking summer was round the corner, the mercury has suddenly dipped. 

 The weatherman though says there is a reason behind the unseasonal nip in the air over the last few days – a 2-degree Celsius fall from the average temperature for this time of the year.
 
 According to Sundar Metri, director, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), such temperatures are not unnatural in January. “This is still winter, so such weather is normal. The average temperature at this time is 16 degrees Celsius. However, since January 19, temperature has hovered around 14 degrees. This happens when the skies are clear during winter, especially at night,” he said.
 
 The condition will last some more days due to pressure levels. “The dip will continue till the time clouds don’t form. Summer will officially arrive only in March. Till then, if any pressure system forms over the  , cloud formation can happen and minimum temperature will increase,” he said. 
 
 Metri also said that weather systems over the Bay of Bengal and the east coast lead to cloud formations over Tamil Nadu and south Karnataka and the absence of these systems could also contribute to a dip in temperature.
 
 ‘“Systems cause cloud formation, which leads to an increase in minimum temperature. If there is no such system, temperature is likely to drop,” he said.
