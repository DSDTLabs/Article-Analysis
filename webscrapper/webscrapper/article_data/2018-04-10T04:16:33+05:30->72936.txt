KOLKATA: Just when the city had started complaining of the rising heat, a late night thunderstorm tamed the mercury. A tall and thick column of cumulonimbus (CB) cloud kept pouring down, pulling off another Nor'wester. The torrential rain dragged the mercury down instantly by about three degrees. 

 Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata director (weather)   said, "The CB cloud that had engulfed the Kolkata sky was very concentrated and its height was almost 10km. Due to the intensity of its energy, it triggered lots of thunder and lightning along with rain." 
 
 Around 8.30pm on Monday the Met office had issued a thunderstorm warning in the city and parts of the neighbouring districts.
 
 Two cyclonic circulations - one over   and another over   - led to favourable conditions for the thunderstorm. While a squall hit Nadia, parts of Birbhum, Murshidabad, east Burdwan, Hoogly and Howrah late on Monday with a wind speed of around 45km an hour, Kolkata got its turn later.
 
 "We also had enough moisture in the air to help the storm. So, the chances of a thunderstorm were very bright," added the   director.
 
 A thundershower on Saturday evening had pulled the mercury down by more than two degrees. But in the absence of rain on Sunday, the heat and humidity started climbing up steadily. The Monday night Nor'wester ensured that the mercury did not climb up drastically.
