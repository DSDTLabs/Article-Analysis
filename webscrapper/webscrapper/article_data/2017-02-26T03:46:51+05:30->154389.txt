AHMEDABAD: Call it destiny — when  , then a student of  , Egypt, started searching for a suitable city in 2016 for his project on eastern architecture, he chose the city founded by another Ahmed. 

 In his study titled ‘Mosques of Gujarat Sultans at Ahmed Abad (sic) City in India – 9th to 15th AD’, which was completed recently, he has shown how the city’s architecture was influenced by local circumstances and made it unique.
 
 “I came across images of Ahmedabad mosques online during my research on eastern architecture and was struck by how different they looked from mosques in other countries,” said Ahmed. “It was during my field work here in early 2016 that I saw the finer points.”
 
 Ahmed said that throughout the Islamic world, architectural style remains more or less consistent. “Even in India, many dynasties borrowed aesthetics from the world they had observed,” said Ahmed. “There might be domes in mosques but corbel domes used here are not very usual. There are arched façades in Delhi and Ajmer but here façades are much more developed to increase light and air flow.”
 
 The study also highlights how Maru-Gujrar style was reflected in Islamic monuments and how even Hindu motifs such as lotus were integrated intelligently by craftsmen. One of the reasons for the phenomenon, Ahmed says, is the long history of confluence of religions. “The region had mosques even before Islamic rule and it was the origin point for a number of prominent Islamic sects,” he said. “Thus, organic growth is reflected in architecture.” 
 
 Professor  , the director of the BJ Institute of Learning and Research, said that the city’s heritage attracts a number of foreign scholars. “Ahmed had visited the institute during his research and I was amazed at how people from faraway places hold the city in high regard,” he said. “It is our responsibility to maintain and nurture our landmarks and make them more accessible.”
