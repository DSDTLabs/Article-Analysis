NEW DELHI: The Centre has amended the Plastic Waste Management Rules — omitting provisions of “explicit pricing of carry bags” which required   — who sold commodities in a carry bag, to register with their respective urban local bodies and pay a minimum fee for this. 

 Though the move, taken on the premise of easing norms for doing business, will help small businesses, the local civic authorities will lose money which could have been used for segregation and disposal of plastic waste. Official, however, noted that the civic agencies could still do it, taking market associations on board for the job. 
 
 The amendment also laid down procedures for phasing out of multi-layered plastic (MLP) which are non-recyclable or non-energy recoverable or of no alternative use. Besides, it prescribes a central system for the registration of producer/importer/brand owner of plastic products. 
 
 The move will help the country’s pollution watchdog —   (CPCB) -in monitoring disposal of plastic waste across the country with taking state agencies on board. The centralised registration system will be evolved by the  . “While a national registry has been prescribed for producers with presence in more than two states, a state-level registration has been prescribed for smaller producers/brand owners operating within one or two states,” said the environment ministry while referring to those amendments. 
 
 Based on several representations received from various stakeholders, the ministry had constituted a committee on issues faced with regard to the implementation of Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 and Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. “The committee deliberated on several issues related to the Rules and its implementation by various stakeholders and submitted its recommendations to the ministry,” said an official statement.
