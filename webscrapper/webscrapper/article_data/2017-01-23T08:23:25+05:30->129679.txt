NEW DELHI: A 70-year-old man was booked in an   attack case after he threw a flammable substance on two women and six children outside his house in northwest Delhi’s Bharat Nagar on Sunday morning.

 The victims had allegedly started a bonfire in front of the accused Vinod Kumar’s house that angered him. 
 
 Police said the victims — Aniket, Suresh, Sooraj, Adarsh, Kamal Karan, Babita and Babli — complained of burns and were rushed to a hospital.
 
 “On Sunday afternoon, we received a call that an elderly man threw acid at some children and women near Shakti Nagar Extension. A team was dispatched to the area who reported that he threw   at them,” said Milind Dumbere, deputy commissioner of police (northwest). 
 
 Kumar told police that he was sitting outside in the sun around 2pm, when he asked the children to play elsewhere, but the children continued there. They then started a bonfire outside his place too. Enraged over this, Vinod opened a phenyl bottle and spilled it on them. 
 
 Aniket’s mother, Babita and her friend Babli, who were sitting next to the house, saw the incident and rushed to their children’s rescue and got hurt. 
 
 “We have booked Kumar under charges of acid   and have detained him,” said the officer.
