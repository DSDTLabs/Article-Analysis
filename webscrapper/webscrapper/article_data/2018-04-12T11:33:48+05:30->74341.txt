MARGAO:  , better known as ‘Boy’, who was chargesheeted by the   police in serial desecration cases, in the reply to the show cause notice issued to him by the South Goa collector for initiating externment proceedings against him, has termed the contents of the notice “absolutely inconsistent” with the report filed by the police against him.

 The notice was issued against him under Section 4 of the Goa Maintenance of Public Order and Safety Act, 1988. Pointing out that the notice was issued based on just one FIR registered against him 18 years ago, Pereira, in his reply, pointed out to the   guidelines that prohibit issuing of show cause notice to initiate externment proceedings based on a single FIR.
 
 “The police have relied upon seven more FIRs which are all registered against unknown persons, and hence the show cause notice issued to the respondent based on these FIRs is bad in law,” the reply reads.
 
 Stressing that there was no threat from him to the maintenance of public peace in the locality or any part of the state of Goa, Pereira prayed that the externment proceedings against him be dropped.
