Vellore: The   government is ‘victimising’   by “stealing”   from the  , which is quenching the thirst of the people of Coimbatore, alleged   leader Dr  .

 The neighbouring state’s act is a clear violation of the 1973 agreement. It is ‘condemnable’, said Anbumani in a press statement and demanded the TN government to act immediately to address the issue through political discourse.
 
 The neighbouring state has been drawing from 50 cusecs to 90 cusecs per day in the last six days. It is against the agreement that entitles Kerala to draw only 5 cusecs of water per day to protect the flora and fauna along the downstream. The Kerala government had also erected makeshift check dams at three spots to prevent the water flow from reaching TN, he noted.
 
 “The Nadu Government should seek the Central Government’s intervention and also approach the Kerala government through proper channel,” he said in the release.
 
 The TN government is drawing 5 crore litre to 7 crore litre of water per day and said there would be a water crisis in the summer if Kerala continues to draw excess water, he further said.
