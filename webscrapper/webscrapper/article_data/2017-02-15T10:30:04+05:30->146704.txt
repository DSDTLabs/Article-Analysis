MADURAI: Most of the people in   city, to whom TOI spoke, said they still consider   their  . However, a section overwhelmingly supported her trusted lieutenant,  .

 Panneerselvam had done commendable work in the last couple of months after the demise of Jaya and is known for his affable nature, the supporters said.
 
 There were supporters of Jaya’s niece   as well. Deepa’s supporters and DMK members started to burst crackers and distributed sweets as soon as the Supreme Court verdict was flashed in the media. However, AIADMK men were in a sombre mood at the party office.
 
 Majority of city residents expressed happiness over the apex court verdict and said corrupt elements are being taken to task.
 
 K Navaneethakrishnan, an engineering student who took part in the jalliakttu protest, said though OPS and Sasikala were close to Jayalalithaa, both were mum on Jaya’s health during the 75-day hospitalisation. “We students don’t want anyone to claim the legacy of Jayalalithaa and stake claim for the government. Anyone who wants to rule the state should face the public through election and respect their decision,” he said. 
 
 Echoing the same view, K Kausalya, a student at an arts college said, “Youngsters who want to serve the society should enter politics and people should support them to keep the old corrupt politicians away.”
 
 Suggesting fresh election, G Selvakumar, a coconut trader from the city said, “I welcome the verdict against Sasikala. We do not want either Panneerselvam or someone close to Sasikala to be in power, since both would be from the same breed. Instead, a re-election should be conducted to know the public opinion.”
 
 R Mala, a senior resident of the city, wanted to ensure apt punishment for the convicted. “The properties of the convicted should be seized and utilised for building roads, interlinking rivers and agriculture. I don’t have crackers, or I would have burst them to express my joy,” she said candidly.
