LUDHIANA: The minority cell of District   under supervision of Abbas Raja organised a programme in North constituency near Jalandhar Bypass. National chairman of Congress party’s minority cell   Sayyad was the chief guest on this occasion. 

 Addressing the people Sayyad said, “Minorities specially Muslims should be beware of communal forces like   and   who stand exposed of their divisive politics." 
 
 On the one hand, the BJP has once again raked the issue of Ram Mandir in its manifesto of UP elections, while on the other, the AAP has shaken hands with the radical elements and sought their support for Punjab elections. 
 
 "Both these parties are trying to gain power by playing communal card,”he said, adding, “People should never vote for either of them and Congress party is the best alternative which will not let these anti-national powers succeed by playing petty politics.” Others present at the rally included district Congress president Gurpreet Gogi, president of women's wing Leena Taparia, Sushil Prashar, Ahmad Ali Guddu, Anwar Ali and others.
