 Reportedly, the actress was spotted sans the rock on her finger recently outside pal  's   condo.
 
  Aniston kept the look casual, wearing a white tee, ripped jeans, a chic black coat and a necklace.
 
  The 49-year-old actress announced her split from husband   on February 15.
 
  While Aniston and Theroux have seemingly stayed under the radar since their breakup, the latter was recently spotted in   for the first time since the announcement, after cancelling his scheduled appearance on a talk show.
