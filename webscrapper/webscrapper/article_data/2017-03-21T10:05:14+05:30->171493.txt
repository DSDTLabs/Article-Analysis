CHENNAI: Holding poorly censored films for obscenity in cinema, which in turn has adverse effects on youths, the Madras high court has summoned ‘heads of the  .’ 

 “Censor board officials are directed to appear before the court on March 27 for the purpose of explaining to the court why necessary action should not be taken against them since they are responsible for exhibiting such kind of cinemas involving POCSO Act offences,” said the bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and Justice Anita Sumanth on Monday.
 
 The judges issued the directive after a minor girl, who eloped with her boyfriend in May last year, was traced in February this year. She was found to be pregnant. The girl told the judges in court that her elopement was the result of similar acts in many films.
 
 It all started with a complaint lodged by Sundararajan, father of the girl, on May 26, 2016 stating that her daughter studying in Class 12 in Myladuthurai had been missing. They later came to know that she had eloped with a local youth identified as Vimalraj, aged 22 years. The Myladuthurai police registered a ‘girl missing’ case.
 
 Inquiries revealed that Vimalraj was involved in several criminal cases in Myladuthurai region, and his father was also involved in several cases too.
 
 The police later traced Vimalraj to Kozhikode on the basis of his mobile phone location. However, when they reached February 10, 2017 the couple was not to be seen there. They surfaced later, and in view of the habeas corpus proceedings initiated by her father in the high court, they appeared in court on Monday.
 
 When the judges held an inquiry with her, as per the HCP procedure, they came to know that she was four months pregnant. She also told the judges that she had eloped with Vimalraj on her own volition, after seeing and being influenced by Tamil films.
 
 Anguished at the incident, the bench orally observed that society had been spoiled by exhibition of bad films.
