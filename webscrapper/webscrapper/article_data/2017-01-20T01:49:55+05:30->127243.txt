GURGAON: More than 40 trees were felled on Wednesday evening in Raisina village, located about 45km away from Delhi’s Asola Sanctuary, to pave way for unauthorised construction of a farmhouse. This is the third incident of illegal construction in the village in the past 40 days. Activists have demanded a special team be posted in the area to keep a check over illegal construction. The area is protected under Aravali Notification.

 TOI on Thursday found the boundary wall of the farmhouse has been constructed in Block B in the past three months and trees were cut to clear land for the construction. Severed trees were also found on the spot. Google images showed there was no wall on the spot some four months back.
 
 Activists said as the area falls under the Aravali Notification, no construction is allowed there as per law. Col Sarvadaman Oberoi (Retd), a legal and environmental expert, said “the area falls in the Aravali gair mumkin pahar (non-cultivable hill) area and is also in the natural conservation area, where construction is banned. Tree-cutting and illegal construction are, therefore, prohibited in the area.”
 
 However,  , a legal and social activist, said, “General Notification under Section 4 of the Forest Conservator Act, 1980, is applicable in the area, so felling trees without permission of forest department is definitely illegal. But to protect plants on their land, people can construct a boundary wall and for that they do not require permission as per Section 6 of the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unscheduled Development Act, 1963.” 
 
 Gurgaon’s deputy commissioner   told TOI, “If required, we can form a team comprising concerned departments (mining, forest, pollution and town & country planning) to demolish illegal construction. Strict action will be taken against offenders.”
