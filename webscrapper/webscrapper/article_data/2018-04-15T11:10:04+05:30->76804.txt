THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ordeal of hundreds of patients who depend on government hospitals worsened on Saturday as the indefinite strike by government doctors entered the second day.

 Even as the state government and opposition parties have criticized the strike and advised the doctors against holding the public health system to ransom with selfish motives, the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association said the government contrived the whole crisis by trying to add on new provisions in the Ardram Mission. The association threatened of en masse resignation of its members if the government removed any doctor served with retrenchment notices.
 
 “The strike is neither against Ardram Mission nor against starting evening OP. It is against the shortage of doctors and paramedical staff. If the government refuses to budge, doctors would call off inpatient treatment as well,” the association said. “The strike was total in all districts. As many as 4,300 doctors stayed away from duty. However, service was given in emergency wings,” the association said.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader   and   state secretary   criticized the doctor’s strike and asked them not to bargain with the lives of people.
 
 Health minister  , meanwhile, said the government was ready for discussions if the doctors were ready to forgo their stubbornness. “The strike was called after action was taken against adoctor who refused to turn up for the evening OP. It is baseless to claim that the strike was against the shortage of staff. All the family health centres have three doctors each and supporting staff. Instead of making wild allegations, the protesters should specifically point out their problems,” she said.
