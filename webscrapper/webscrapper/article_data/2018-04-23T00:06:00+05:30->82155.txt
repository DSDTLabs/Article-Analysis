Pimpri Chinchwad: Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar aid on Tuesday that the civic body, in a bid to cut costs, will float revised tenders for house-to-house garbage collection in six months. 

 The standing committee of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation had last week cancelled tenders in two zones. Until the revised tenders are floated, the two agencies appointed for garbage collection will continue to collect and take the trash to the Moshi garbage depot, members of the standing committee said.
 
 Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap said the tenders would be divided into eight zones of the municipal limits. 
 
 “Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had told office-bearers and MLAs to decentralize garbage collection,” Jagtap said. 
 
 The earlier tenders were for an eight-year term for an estimated cost of Rs450 crore. “We decided to revise tenders in eight zones to reduce costs,” Jagtap said. 
 
 Meanwhile, Jagtap said the process of reducing penalty tax on illegal constructions in   limits will take some more time, as a government resolution is awaited in this regard.
