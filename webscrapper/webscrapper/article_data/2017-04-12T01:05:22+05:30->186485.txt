The   and three   of Nanded-Mumbai   got detached from the remaining 13 coaches as the train pulled out of Manmad railway station on Tuesday evening. The engine and three coaches covered a distance of about 2km before the faux pas was realized.

 Railway sources said the   holding the third and fourth coaches got delinked as soon as the train left the station. “It is a serious incident. Had the coupling got detached when the entire train was in motion, it could have led to a grave accident,” said   officials. One of the reasons for the delinking of the coupling could be the jerk when the train chugs out of a station, said railway officials.
 
 As the train left the station around 5.10pm, passengers in the remaining 13 coaches and those on the platform were confused at the sight of the engine departing with just three coaches. After covering a 2km distance, the en-gine and three coaches reversed to the station.
 
 Divisional railway manager of Bhusawal railway division S K Gupta said preliminary probe has revealed that the coupling between the two coaches got detached. “The coaches are not maintained by Bhusawal division. A communication has been sent to the maintenance department of Central Railway,” Gupta added. tnn
