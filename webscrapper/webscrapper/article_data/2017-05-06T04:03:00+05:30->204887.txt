AHMEDABAD: The New   of the   (AMC) has as many as 56 roads, including those in areas such as Bodakdev, Jodhpur, Thaltej, Ghatliodia, being resurfaced. The zone thus has the highest number of ongoing road works in the city. This information was given out at the review meeting of the roads and buildings department, on Friday.

 Officials said that as the monsoon is likely to set in by mid-June, the AMC must complete all resurfacing work before then. At the meeting, chairman Jatin Patel is said to have asked officials, especially those of New West Zone, to complete these works in time.
 
 Patel said the maximum roads being resurfaced were in the New West Zone because the AMC has taken up the round-the-clock water supply project in that area, digging work for that had been going on. Moreover, there were delays in completing the resurfacing work as it began late, due to the unseasonal summer rains.
 
 Officials said that in all 48km of road was to be resurfaced, of which only 19.1km was completed. He said 35 roads were to be widened to 60 feet and work has been completed on 18 of these.
 
 Officials said that apart from the 56 roads in the New West Zone, three roads were being resurfaced in West Zone, which includes Naranpura, Stadium Crossroads, Paldi and other areas. There were 25 resurfacing projects under way in South Zone, 23 in North Zone and around 40 in East Zone.
