HYDERABAD: After a long break from their previous   match and this one against  ,   emerged victorious with a 1-0 scoreline at the AOC Grounds in the early evening of Sunday (March 12).

 The sole goal from   Singh in the second half secured the win for the second Division League team. 
 
 Fateh largely dominated both halves creating many chances, though AG came close in the first half through Abdul Rehman who shot wide. 
 
 No. 16 Bonison broke the deadlock and scored the opener after a shot from No. 19 Vicky Meitei was deflected by an AGORC defender and went to Bonison, who slammed it into the net. 
 
 The other closest chance came from   in the first half when Bonison was taken down to the right of the penalty box by a dirty tackle that got the AGORC player a yellow card and a free kick to Fateh which was taken by Jay, who passed it to Gurtej Singh in the middle, who then passed it to Luis Carlos who took the shot only to have it go slightly over the post.
 
 “Our boys fully deserved to win the game and displayed their best performance since the second Division I-League. I want to congratulate AG on representing Hyderabad so well. We’re looking forward to the next game and the ‘A’ Division Rahim Super League,” said Fateh Hyderabad's head coach, Yogesh Maurya.
