GURUGRAM: A petition has been filed in the Punjab and Haryana   against MCG for creulty towards animals, particularly monkeys and pigs.

It is submitted that this is direct ramification of swine flu and other zootic diseases which cause pandemics,” says the petition.
 
 “MCG has been catching monkeys after illegally inducing drugs through bananas, administering pain through cruel handling, breaking up family groups, reportedly selling the juvenile and infant monkeys to madaris and/or killing them or causing them to disappear in undisclosed locations,” it adds.
 
 The petition has been filed by animal   Amit Chaudhery. He is also an honorary animal welfare officer of the  .
 
 “It is a truly unfortunate and sad reflection of our times that government functionaries are misusing the taxpayers money to indulge in illegality and crime have to be made accountable through courts of law,” he told TOI.
 
 MCG on Friday sought more time to respond to the petition. “We are going to follow all the directions of the court. We have all the required documentation and all procedures are in place in hiring contractors for transportation of animals,” said an MCG official.
