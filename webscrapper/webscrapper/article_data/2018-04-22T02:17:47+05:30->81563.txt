NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal inspected the progress of the work of the   grade separator project on Saturday, and directed the civic officials of   to prepare a comprehensive traffic dispersal plan in coordination with agencies concerned as congestion is likely to increase once it opens up for public shortly.

 Baijal has also directed the north corporation to undertake the beautification project by placing public art, and developing vertical gardens.
 
 The project, which was commissioned by erstwhile MCD in 2006 to decongest the stretch between   and ISBT Kashmere Gate, is yet to see the light of the day. Now, the project is due to be completed by July 2018.
 
 “Over time, the cost of the project has escalated from Rs 177 crore to Rs 724 crore,” said a senior official from north civic body. “The shifting work is done and the construction work is likely to get completed in next two months. The grade separator project will be thrown open to the public in July this year."
