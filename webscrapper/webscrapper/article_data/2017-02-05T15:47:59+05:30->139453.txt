" " star   helped her co-actor   stage a replica of singer   Knowles' iconic pregnancy announcement earlier this week.
 
  The 33-year-old actress, who is expecting her first child with actor Matt Alan, posted a photograph on Instagram where Pompeo can be seen playing director with her striking the pose similar to that of Beyonce.
  
  "Arguing over whether this is really necessary @ellenpompeo," Luddington captioned the picture.
  
  This was followed by a video where Pompeo can be heard saying, "I think this is amazing. You're pregnant at the same time as Beyonce. When is that ever going to happen again, Camilla?"
  
  To this Luddington asked, "I just feel a bit weird. Are we taking this thing too far?"
  
  But Pompeo tried to convince her co-star saying she is "glowing" and put a veil on the face of a confused Camilla.
  
  After Beyonce's news broke the internet, many people have tried their hand at recreating the very moment around the world.
