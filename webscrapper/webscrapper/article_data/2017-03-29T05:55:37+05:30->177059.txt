CHANDIGARH: Punjab local bodies and tourism minister   on Monday said that his department is keen to search a   like Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan to promote tourism in the state. 

 "I have seen great brand ambassadors like  . The problem is that we have so many sacred places but no one to help tourists coming here. Almost 1.25 lakh people visit the   everyday but most of them pay obeisance at the shrine and return to their states by afternoon. Why? Because we never provided them clean toilets, hygienic and affordable places to stay. We need to aggressively advertise our tourism," Sidhu told TOI.
 
 He said that, "Though Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder will decide on the name of brand ambassador" but added that Amarinder himself could be the face of   as Sikhs worldwide remember and respect him most for his gesture of quitting the Congress after the 1984 crisis.
 
 "The ideas are in embryonic stage. Good things die unless they are implemented. Nobody implemented the ideas in last ten years. Can there be bigger Sikh than Capt Amarinder. Religious tourism is the backbone of Punjab," he said. 
 
 Sidhu said that his department would also work out a package deal for tourists visiting Punjab and Jammu. "We are going to conceive a package of circuit tourism, which will help people visit the Darbar Sahib, enjoy a zaika of Amritsari food, then leave for Beating the Retreat ceremony at Attari-Wagah border, heritage visit to birthplace of Luv Kush and then to Vaishno Devi in Jammu," he said. Sidhu also said that Amarinder government was keen on introducing e-governance reforms.
