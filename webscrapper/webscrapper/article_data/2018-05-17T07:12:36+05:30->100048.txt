 A follower of Osho, Sucameli, has been developing the project for a while and had even set up a crowdfunding website. 
 
 In an interview in 2010, the director had revealed the premise of the story. 
 
 The film "tells the story of a female journalist who follows Osho's life in America, then onto the world tour until his death in Pune in 1990," he had said. 
 
 "The main character is at first very sceptical towards Osho and his commune but changes her mind through time... In this way I hope to catch the attention of those who still see Osho with a negative attitude, which includes a large part of movie goers, especially in the States," Sucameli had said. 
 
 Rajneesh's move to America was the subject of the documentary where the directors explored the rise of the cult in Oregon, America, the internal politics of the commune and the distrust of the locals towards the guru and followers. 
 
 The commune did not survive for long and Rajneesh was arrested while trying to flee Oregon. He left the US and returned to his ashram in Pune.
