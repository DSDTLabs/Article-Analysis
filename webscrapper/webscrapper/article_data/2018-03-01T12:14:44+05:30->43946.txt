AHMEDABAD: Increase in area under cultivation and higher yield is expected to push up castor seed production in Gujarat in 2017-18. The production in the state, which accounts for more than 80% of castor output in India, is estimated to be 12 lakh tonnes, states a castor crop survey 2017-18. 

 The castor production in 2017-18 will rise by more than 30% as compared to nearly 9 lakh tonne of castor output in 2016-17.
 
 The increase in production is largely attributed to higher yield and acreage. Total area under castor in Gujarat for the year 2017-18 stood at 5,95,600 hectares as per the government's estimates, which showed a rise of 5% over last year's estimate of 5,65,400 hectares.

 Castor yield in Gujarat is expected to be much higher at 2,050 kg per hectare in 2017-18. Estimates of SEA had pegged the yield at 1,524 kg per hectare in the previous year.
 
 Across India, castor seed production is likely to be over 14 lakh tonnes and average yield is expected to be 1,738 kg/hectare. The castor output was around 11 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. Apart from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and   are the major castor growing states in India.
