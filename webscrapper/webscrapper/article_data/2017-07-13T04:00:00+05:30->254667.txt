Vadodara: The police department has undertaken a project to digitize the control room and make it more responsive to the public. Once implemented, police will be able to reach the spot of crime within minutes and start investigations immediately. 

 The idea is to ensure that the caller gets quick response from the control room and the cops reach the spot swiftly. If the police is able to address the complaint quickly, the chances of crime detection go up significantly. The entire control room will be put on a digital platform and police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar is overseeing the project. 
 
 Currently, if any citizen calls police control room, chances are that they may get a busy tone. The new system resembling the 911 emergency service is being set up to ensure that no calls get dropped. 
 
 If one landline phone is engaged, the system will dispatch the call to any of the 20 work stations and the call will be answered within seconds. There will also be a display screen so that if a call gets dropped due to any reason, the cop on duty will dial the callerâ€™s number.
 
 Once the call is addressed by the control room and the information is fed in the computer, it would trace police control room (PCR) vehicle nearest to the spot through the automatic vehicle locator. The PCR van will then reach the spot through the shortest possible route to reduce the response time. The CCTVs will also be linked to this system for effective crime detection.
