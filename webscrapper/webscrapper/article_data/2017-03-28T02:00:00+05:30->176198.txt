GAYA: Prakash Yadav alias Tannu, a well-connected property dealer, is on police radar in connection with the mysterious killing of his wife  , who was shot dead at their home in   locality of   town on Saturday night.

 In his initial statement, the property dealer told police that two gunmen barged into his house with the intention to commit loot. When resisted, they shot his wife in the head, killing her instantly.
 
 However, police said they found little corroborative evidence to support the husbandâ€™s version. His failure to organise medical aid for his wife and delay in informing police have added to the suspicion, police added.
 
 The   cameras installed in the house were found non-functional. The couple was alone in the house at the time of occurrence. Police have also not found any evidence of forced entry of any outsider into the house.
 
 According to Gaya   Garima Malik, forensic experts have collected evidence and reports are being awaited. Asked whether she suspected the hand of the property dealer in the crime, the SSP said she could not be judgmental at this stage. She also made it clear she was not giving a clean chit to the husband.
