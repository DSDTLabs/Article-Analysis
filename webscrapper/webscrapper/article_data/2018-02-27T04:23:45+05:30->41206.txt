MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has said that the list of changes in assignments for benches put out on Saturday, that resulted in the appeals in the   being assigned to a new judge, was routine, reports Shibu Thomas. 

 “It is a usual change in assignments. Every two or three months, roster is changed. The acting chief justice is not supposed to know of each and every individual matter. The note is very clear that parties can approach the acting CJ to treat the matter as part-heard and it can then be delegated to the same bench that is hearing the case,” registrar general Shrinivas Agrawal told TOI on Monday.
 
 TOI had reported on the change in assignments on Sunday. As per the new list, Justice Revati Mohite-Dere, who was hearing appeals in the alleged   encounter case, has been assigned to hear bail and anticipatory bail applications. Justice Nitin Sambre has now been assigned criminal writ petitions and criminal revision applications, given earlier to Justice Mohite-Dere. So according to the list, Justice Sambre is supposed to hear the Sohrabuddin case. The next date of hearing for the   has not yet been updated on the high court website. Justice Mohite-Dere is on leave till March 1, as per a notice issued on Monday.
 
 As per the sitting list notice “part-heard matters cease to be part-heard with change of assignment unless where a proposal for continuation of the matters is sent by the concerned bench at the request of the parties and the same is approved by the Acting Chief Justice.”
 
 Justice Mohite-Dere had been conducting day-to-day hearings in the Sohrabuddin case since February 9. The CBI had filed appeals challenging the discharge of Gujarat officer N K Amin and Rajasthan police constable Dalpat Rathod.
