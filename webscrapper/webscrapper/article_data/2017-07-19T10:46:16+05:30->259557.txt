BENGALURU: While the   is racing against time to meet its August 15 deadline to open 198  , the opposition Janata Dal (S) is all set to launch Namma Appaji Canteen, its first low-cost canteen, by this month-end.

 “We have tentatively decided to launch our first canteen on July 28,“ said gold merchant-turned politician T A Saravana, who has agreed to bear the cost and dedicate it to party supremo H D Deve Gowda, who's fondly called “Appaji“ in family and close party circles.
 
 The party has decided to set up the model canteen in a rented building in Hanumanthnagar, Basavanagudi. A technical team has already begun working on the project and everything should be ready in the next two weeks, said Saravana, a member of the legislative council representing JD(S).
 
 Once the model canteen is up, Saravana said they'll study the pros and cons of the same and extend the facility to all 28 assembly constituencies of Bengaluru and also other parts of the state.
 
 The aim is to offer hygienic, highquality and a variety of food items at af fordable cost, he pointed out.
 
 To begin with, the canteen will open at 7.30am and close by 2.30pm. “As of now, we have decided not to run it at night.We'll take a call on that depending on the response. We are hoping around 1,000 people would visit the canteen every day,'' Saravana added.
 
 
 
 At the Namma Appaji canteen, Saravana said, one can have two idlis and one uddina vada for Rs 5, coffee and tea at Rs 3 and a meal of rice, sambar and ragi mudde (millet ball) for Rs 10. In addition, they also plan to offer kharabath and kesaribath for Rs 5 and pongal and bisibelebath for Rs 10.
