Rajkot: A food grain trader was looted of Rs 5 lakh cash by two unidentified assailants on a scooter soon after he withdrew the money from a bank on Tuesday.

 The incident took place when Dilip Pipaliya (40), who owns a food grain trading firm in new marketing yard, was going towards his shop after withdrawing cash from a private bank near the police commissioner’s office.
 
 According to police, the CCTV footage obtained from the bank showed that Pipaliya, riding a scooter, was being followed by two men on another scooter as soon as he came out of the bank. After nearly 10km, when Pipaliya reached a stretch where he was alone of the road, the two accused intercepted his vehicle and started aruguing with him.
 
 One of them accused Pipaliya of ramming into his vehicle a couple of days back and started hitting him. The other accused too thrashed him and the duo fled with Pipaliya’s scooter with cash in the boot space. Later, the scooter was found abandoned about 4km away near Bhagwatipura with the cash missing.
 
 Pipaliya has lodged a complaint with Kuvadva police station against the assailants. Police said they are examining CCTV footages to get clue about the two assailants.
