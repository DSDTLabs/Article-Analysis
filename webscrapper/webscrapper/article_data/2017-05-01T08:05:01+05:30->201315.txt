 “On one hand, the government is acting to be sensitive for the Muslim women, and on the other hand, has attacked their choice of staple food in the form of an unsaid meat bandi,” added  , state president, AIDWA. The organisation also criticised the ‘anti-Romeo squad’ as a reflection to the government’s mentality against love (vis-a-vis the character Romeo) and stressed for a special law be formed against honour killing instead.
