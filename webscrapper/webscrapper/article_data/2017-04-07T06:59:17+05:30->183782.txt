VISAKHAPATNAM: To mark the centenary year of   (AMC), which is completing 100 years in 2023, a new Centenary Academic Block would be constructed on 1.7 acre land in   premises. The old AMC girls' hostel is also likely to get a new building. 

 The Centenary Academic Block would consist of six-seven floors and house examination halls, library, guest house, auditorium, lecture halls all under one roof, as per   (MCI) norms.
 
 Addressing the media for the first time after taking over as AMC principal, Dr PV   said, "The block would cost approximately 40 crore. Andhra Medical College Alumni of North America (Amcana) would contribute around 7 crore, while the local alumni would contribute another 7 crore. If the government gives double the amount as grant, we can get the required funds for construction of the block. The health minister has verbally okayed the project. We will now have to enter into a written memorandum of understanding with the government to take the project forward." 
 
 A 20-member committee headed by vice-chancellor of NTR Health University Dr T Ravi Raju and consisting of AMC alumni, Amcana members, renowned doctors and director of medical education (DME) has also been formed for the project.
 
 Proposals for the girls' hostel would be sent to the government to start the construction of a new building. "I have asked the AMPSIDC engineers to identify the land for the new hostel, which will have 400 rooms. At present, 350 girl students are lodged in 112 rooms, most of which are located in an old building. I have also invited each batch of old students to take up renovation of one department each to improve the overall infrastructure," added Dr Sudhakar.
 
 The principal also said he is aiming to improve teaching, regulating the time and bedside teaching in the morning and afternoon. More research activities will also be encouraged.
