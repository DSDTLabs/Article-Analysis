 has been the kind of actor who goes to great lengths to perfect his character – he has done that for films such as Sakhaavu and Richie. His latest attempt to do some action scenes though has left him with an injured arm and a fortnight’s rest before he can resume his schedule.

 The film’s director   tells us that Nivin was shooting for an action sequence when the mishap happened. “The scene required him to jump down from a height and kick a goon. I told him that we could use a dupe for the sequence but he insisted that he wanted to do it himself. While filming, Nivin sort of lost his balance and landed on his arm,” says Rosshan. 
 
 Incidentally, it’s not the first time an actor had a close shave with an accident performing a stunt sequence in Rosshan’s film. In 2011, while shooting for a bike stunt in Casanovva,   escaped with minor injuries after the motorcycle skid a ramp and fell 10ft. 
 
 The filmmaker thought says that Nivin has suffered a “minor fracture” and that the doctors have advised a fortnight’s rest. The team had only 15 more days of filming left – out of which a week was to be shot in Sri Lanka – before Nivin was injured. This means that Nivin’s next project, which is Dhyan Sreenivasan’s   has been shifted to May.
 
 Dhyan tells us, “Nivin would be done with   only by mid of April, and soon after that he will be joining the rehearsals of AMMA’s upcoming show. So, we are expecting to start shooting by May mid as of now.”
