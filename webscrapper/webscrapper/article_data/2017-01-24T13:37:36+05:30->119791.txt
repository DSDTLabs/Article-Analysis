Sandalwood's Challenging Star Darshan had many concerned when he was seen at an event sporting a sling around his right arm on Sunday. The actor, who is going to be seen in   next, injured himself two days ago. Darshan was apparently working out when he pulled a muscle and injured it. He has been advised to support his arm with a sling for a couple of days for it to recover fully. 

 This isn't the first time that Darshan has injured himself while working out. In 2015, he had injured his left shoulder when working out and was out of action for nearly a month. In 2014, he was seen sporting a bandage around his right arm at an event in  . The actor had sprained a muscle back then and was again advised around half a month's rest.
 
 Meanwhile, Darshan is prepping for director Prakash's (of   fame) next film, which will have   and   as his co-stars.
