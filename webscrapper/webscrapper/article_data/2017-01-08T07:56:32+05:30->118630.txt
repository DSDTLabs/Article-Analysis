CHENNAI: The Madras high court has declined to entertain a PIL which accused the vice-chancellor of Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University Dr Geethalakshmi of appointing her husband Dr R Sugumar and doctor   as members of top academic bodies, and purchasing high-end cars against rules. Filed by Varaaki, the PIL sought a direction to the governor-chancellor to take action against the medical university vice-chancellor.

 Dismissing the PIL, and rapping the petitioner, the first bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar said: “We are completely dissatisfied with the bonafides of this petition. The power of the vi ce-chancellor, in turn, is checked by various bodies, where agendas are placed and approved.
 
 “Thus, there is a control and check mechanism provided under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University Act, 1998 itself.“
 
 They then dismissed the PIL saying they were not inclined to entertain it.
