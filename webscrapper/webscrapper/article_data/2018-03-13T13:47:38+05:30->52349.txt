PANAJI:  , a secular percussion instrument used by both Hindus and Catholics in folk and religious  , is on the verge of being declared a state   instrument, said minister for art and culture Govind Gaude. 

 “It is under process. The file has gone to the CM’s office and pending approval,” he told TOI on Monday.
 
 Gaude said the ghumot is not only an asset of Goa, but has drawn global attention owing to its uniqueness.
 
 The centuries-old instrument is extensively used in community festivals like Shigmo or zagor and rituals associated with temples. “Despite its popularity in Goa, it is little known that the ghumot has transcended geographical boundaries of the state and finds its place among musical instruments in Karwar and Honnavar as well,” said cultural activist  .
 
 Probably the only surviving mud instrument and a rare type of percussion, the ghumot was celebrated in a day-long festival curated by Fernandes in February, last year. While a Ponda-based group performed the ghumot aarti at the event, a Christian group from Zuari played music that is conventionally put up during the folk festival, zagor.
 
 The   (GHAG) had been pushing for the recognition of the instrument in a bid to give it the status of a heritage instrument and had met Gaude in this regard. Following which, the file was moved to the government.
 
 “Drums and percussions have come recently. Ghumot was the only instrument played in different maands in Goa. Elevating the ghumot to the status of a state heritage instrument will help revive the popularity of the instrument,” Gaude said.
