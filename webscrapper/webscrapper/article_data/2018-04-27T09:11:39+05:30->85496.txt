BHOPAL: A   court has summoned   founder and CEO Mark   in response to a civil suit filed by a citybased startup alleging “mental harassment”.

 Additional sessions judge   issued the order — with directions to send the summons to Zuckerberg by email — after hearing a civil suit filed by Swapnil Rai, who runs a portal thetradebook.org, which he says is a business networking platform.
 
 Rai alleges that Facebook stopped his paid advertisement campaign to promote his ‘thetradebook’ page after running it for three days and then issued a legal notice on the title of his portal. The campaign was run between August 8 and 14, 2016, and a second one was scheduled between April 14 and 21, 2018.
 
 “The second campaign was stopped wrongfully, midway, on April 16. Facebook asked for payment of Rs 215 for the first two days. In the second ad campaign, there was promotion of the webpage www.thetradebook.org, containing a registered trademark ‘tradefeed’,” Rai said.
 
 According to Rai, Facebook wants him to remove word ‘book’ from the name of his portal. “They have been sending me legal notices, causing immense mental stress. Facebook opposes my trademark application under Class 42 and Class 38 (of the Trademark Filing Classification) and pressurising me to withdraw the trademark application,” Rai told TOI.
