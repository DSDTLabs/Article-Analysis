CHENNAI: Citing a TOI's report titled 'Bikers take over   footpath for parking as police look the other way' dated April 9, a public interest writ petition was sought to be filed in Madras high court, seeking judicial intervention in the matter.

 When the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   commenced proceedings on Monday morning, advocate S   made an urgent mention seeking court's attention on the news article.
 
 "In the guise of preventing entry of protesters demanding constitution of   management board, police have cordoned off the entire stretch of Marina which is causing huge inconvenience to morning walkers. This apart, they have also restricted entry of vehicles into the beach area, resulting in such illegal parking as pointed out in the news report," Sathyanarayanan said.
 
 He requested the bench to take cognisance of the issue and direct the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps to prevent such illegal parking.
 
 Agreeing to hear the matter, the bench asked the advocate to file a proper public interest litigation.
 
 According to the news report, barring visitorsâ€™ entry into Marina beach has been the norm since the jallikattu protests in 2017. The police last week blocked access to the service road off Marina and the promenade off  's Beach to discourage people from using these beaches as venues for demonstrations.
