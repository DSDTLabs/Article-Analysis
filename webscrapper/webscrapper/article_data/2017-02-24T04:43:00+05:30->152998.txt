Panaji: Even before the school hours end in primary   in Tiswadi taluka, the directorate of education now receives an automated feedback on the midday meals served for the day. An integrated voice response service (IVRS) makes automated phone calls to designated teachers from the schools at a predecided time and they then enter their feedback.

 The IVRS has been developed by the Infotech Corporation of   and is running a pilot basis in Tiswadi schools. Infotech Corporation managing director Nilesh Phaldessai said that the IVRS will be ready to be introduced in all the 1,500 schools across Goa by mid-March.
 
 The teachers have the option of giving their feedback in English, Konkani and Marathi so that correct information is gathered.
 
 The IVRS asks the teacher feedback on whether the   for the day was served, if the meal was checked and if the school was satisfied with the quality. Number of female and male students who were served the meals is also be recorded.
 
 The Union human resource development (HRD) ministry had asked states to device such automated systems, where email, SMS or IVRS is used to monitor midday meals on a real time basis. Until now, the additional district education inspectors collect the feedback on the midday meals served from schools and then send the report to the directorate of education. This allows much time to lapse between the time the feedback is received and it is conveyed to the authorities.
 
 Other than improving the quality of the meals, the IVRS is expected to plug any leakage of funds in real time by monitoring how many students have been served meals each day. 
 
 Once the IVRS is implemented in all schools across the state, the data collected will also be fed to the central governmentâ€™s midday meal monitoring portal even before the school hours for the day are over.
