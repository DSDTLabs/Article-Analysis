MOHALI: A 14-year-old   girl, who went missing four days ago, was found in Mumbai by local police on Friday. She said she went to Mumbai to become a Bollywood actress.

 Neha, an ardent fan of Hindi movies and serials, left her home in   village for school on May 21. However, instead of reaching school, she boarded a train to Mumbai from the local railway station.
 
 Police said   had only Rs 500 cash then. She borrowed Rs 300 from a passenger in the train.
 
  After she went missing, her parents claimed that she had been kidnapped by a 28-year-old youth. However, police investigation ruled out the allegation.
 
 Later, on Thursday, she called a friend to inform that she had reached Mumbai. This friend then informed police about her location, inquiry officer and SHO   said.
 
 “Her friend somehow convinced her to reach at   railway station to take some money from her. When she reached there, we took her back to parents,” SHO said.
 
 It is learnt that the girl first refused to go home, citing frequent fights between her parents as a reason. However, cops and her family convinced her later.
