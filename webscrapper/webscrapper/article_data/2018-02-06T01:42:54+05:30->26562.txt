MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday directed the   government to use   and   to continuously monitor and protect   across the state. A division bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Nitin Sambre warned the government to appoint the authority under the new Wetland Rules 2017 or face contempt action. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Vanashakti. 

 Advocate Zaman Ali, counsel for the petitioner, claimed the deadline for appointment of the authority under the new rules was December 26, 2017. Additional government pleader G W Mattos assured the court the panel would be set up within two weeks. The court questioned the state on why it had not yet constituted a grievance redressal committee, even as wetlands and mangroves were being destroyed. The court said people were without a proper remedy. 
 
 The court has told the advocate general to be present at the next hearing. It sought a progress report on the protection of wetlands. tnn
