NEW DELHI: The   castigated the Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday for giving Rs 11,000 as interim help to families displaced by construction of minor dams as against Rs 50,000 given to those who lost their homes to major dam projects.

 Advocate   told a bench headed by Chief Justice   that such discrimination in relief and rehabilitation measures to similarly placed families was inhuman.
 
 He was advocating the cause of 370 families rendered homeless by minor irrigation project of Kharak Dam, who were given Rs 11,000 as per the state’s 2002 policy.
 
 Advocate C D Singh, appearing for the MP government, said when the affected villagers, mostly tribals, approached the HC, the state had indicated willingness to offer Rs 50,000 to each of the affected families as per a new rehabilitation policy of 2008 titled ‘the Madhya Pradesh Adarsh Punarvas Niti’. 
 
 This amount was ordered to be given by the HC on July 18, 2016. Stinging the MP government for differentiating between minor and major  , the bench of Justices Khehar, N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud said: “You are treating them like animals. You have to give proper compensation to them.” It ordered immediate payment of Rs 50,000 to each family.
 
 The affected families through ‘Jagrit Adivasi Dalit Sangathan’ had moved the   claiming adequate compensation and an effective mechanism to adjudicate their grievances relating to rehabilitation. These families belonged to Khargaon and Barwani districts.
 
 The bench ordered the MP government to set up three grievance redressal bodies, each headed by a retired district judge, immediately to determine the relief and rehabilitation package for these dam oustees.
 
 The bench clarified that the GRAs were free to determine a package that was higher than what is provided under the 2008 policy. It said the GRAs would decide each claim within three months of its filing.
