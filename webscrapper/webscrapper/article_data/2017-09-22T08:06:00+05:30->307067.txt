Ludhiana: Almost six months into the financial year, civic officials have woken up to sluggish recovery of water supply and sewerage dues. The department has to recover Rs 100 crore in water supply and sewerage dues this financial year, but officials could not even make 10% of the total recovery. 

 Civic officials recovered Rs 6.83 crore from water supply and sewerage dues till September 18. In the last financial year, they recovered Rs 23.36 crore. Officials said they have been given the target of recovering Rs 100 crore, which is not possible as half the year has passed. However, they said they would try.
 
 MC records show Rs 300 crore is to be recovered for water supply and sewerage but this figure needs to be checked. An official said half of these connections cannot be traced and some are exempt. He also said they will get it checked.
 
 Despite the holiday on Thursday, additional commissioner Rishipal Singh held a meeting with officials of the operation and maintenance cell. They have been asked to either perform or perish. Officials have served 12 show cause notices on clerks and inspectors because of the slow pace of recovery. 
 
 Superintending engineer, operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said earlier, staff was busy checking forms of atta dal scheme and a few other surveys, because of which recovery took a backseat. He said they have asked officials concerned to step up the pace of recovery, failing which they would have to suffer consequences. 
 
 Deadline for AMRUT works
 
 Civic officials have been asked to complete works under AMRUT scheme by the end of November. Under phase 1, officials have been laying water supply lines in 24 wards. According to officials, work on water supply lines is almost complete and only tubewell construction is left. Local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu gave instructions to officials in a recent meeting.
