AMRITSAR: Amritsar-born   , a research scholar in the UK, is hoping to make a breakthrough in finding a treatment for   to help people back home living with the condition that has assumed epidemic proportions. 

 A bachelor in biomedical sciences from Kingston University, London,   (28) is in the final year of her PhD in genetics on the topic 'Wnt/PCP signaling pathway or diabetes'. "I chose this topic for research since diabetes is rising in the developed as well as developing countries like India, at a rapid pace. I am in my third year. If my research is successful, the future implications of it would be a possible development of beta cells that produce insulin. This would particularly help diabetic patients who either cannot produce insulin (type 1 diabetes) or become insulin resistant (type 2 diabetes). We are still trying to validate how beta cells will differentiate and respond to different molecules of the signaling pathway," Amtul told TOI from London on Tuesday. 
 
 Amtul said her research on diabetes involves investigating Wnt/PCP signaling pathways in the beta cell differentiation. "This pathway regulates many bodily functions including the development of organs such as pancreas which produces insulin and glucagon hormones that regulate sugar in the body," she said.
 
 The Wnt pathway regulates the development and differentiation of many organs in the body such as lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas and also regulates the alignment of cells and how a normal organ would develop without any defects, she explained. "If there are any problems within this pathway of Wnt/PCP, an organ would seize to function or will work abnormally. Any disturbance in the pathway can also lead to cancer," said Amtul, who, on average, puts in eight hours a day in the lab experimenting.
