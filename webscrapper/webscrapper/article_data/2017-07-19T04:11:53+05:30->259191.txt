GURUGRAM: The state government has decided to install   cameras in all urban areas of Haryana.

  ordered on Tuesday to install CCTV cameras in all municipal areas to strengthen the security system in cities. 
 
 Each municipal body has been asked to submit lists of places where it wants to get CCTVs installed.
 
 On its part, the   has revived the plan to install CCTV cameras in the old city. Around three years ago, it had announced its plan to put these cameras at Rajiv Chowk, Sadar Bazaar and Civil Lines. However the project has been caught in a limbo.
 
 “Around three years ago, the work started on having CCTV cameras from Rajiv Chowk to Sadar Bazaar to Civil Lines and back to Rajiv Chowk. However, the tender process got caught in a limbo. We revised the order in April this year and the digging work to lay the cables is currently going on. We hope to have the CCTVs in place by September,” said MCG commissioner V Umashankar.
 
 “We will also have two video walls — one in the MCG office and the other in the office of the police commissioner,” he added.
 
 The MCG is also planning to have CCTV cameras across the city in the second phase not only to monitor crime but also to keep tabs on traffic movement. As per the original plan, these cameras are to be of various types — fixed cameras, PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras and ANPR (automatic number plate reader) cameras.
 
 Jain, who held a review meeting of her department in Chandigarh on Tuesday, also asked her officials to explore possibilities for providing Wi-Fi facility in each city of the state. She also asked them to raise awareness through campaigns about a proposal to use their vacant plots in urban areas as parking areas. 
 
 The Haryana government has already issued a notification in this regard. However, the response has not been encouraging. MCG authorities say they have not received even a single application so far from those who wish to use their vacant plots as a parking lot.
