New Delhi: The   of   has   two   with a   of   and  . The arms were to be supplied to a city gang that was planning a big robbery, said cops.

 The arrested men are cousins, Vineet Kumar and Ram Kumar. The two are in their early thirties and belong to Aligarh. The two men procured weapons from Burhanpur-Badwani border of Madhya Pradesh. The men bought the pistols for Rs 10,000 each and a magazine for Rs 3000-4000, but sold them as “combo” of one pistol and two magazines for Rs 40,000-50,000.
 
 The seized weapons are of high quality and don’t have jamming issues. The cops are digging deeper at this combo sale of weapons as only hardcore shooters carry spare magazines with them.
 
 The cell had sent teams to Aligarh and other parts of UP and Madhya Pradesh, which took two months to develop information on gun-runners. “We learnt that two notorious gun-runners would come to Rajghat to deliver weapons, and a trap was laid and the accused arrested,” DCP (special cell) Pramod Kushwaha.
 
 “In 2009, Vineet and Ram got involved in a case of attempt to murder during a dispute on their property. In jail, they met arms suppliers from MP and UP and took a plunge in this trade. At first, they began supplying weapons to UP criminals but switched to Delhi gangs in the wake of high demand and better price,” Kushwaha added.
