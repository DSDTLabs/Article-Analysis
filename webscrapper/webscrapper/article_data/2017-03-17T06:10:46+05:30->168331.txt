BENGALURU: A traffic   inspector turned good Samaritan for six children and ferried them in his jeep to their school in Jayanagar on Thursday morning. The kids were appearing for their final exams.

 The driver of the schoolbus carrying the children had earlier been caught driving under the influence of alcohol during a police crackdown against drunk driving.
 
 Traffic inspector Veeji Kumar, attached to Basavanagudi, was checking schoolbuses near   and  . This after DCP-traffic (west) Shobha Rani had directed jurisdictional cops to carry out surprise checks against drivers and subject them to an alcohol test.
 
 Shobha Rani said Veeji Kumar detained private school bus driver T T Dharmendra at 8.30am after he failed to pass the test and seized the bus. There were six students in the vehicle, studying in UKG and class 1.
 
 “When Veeji alerted me that there were schoolchildren in the seized bus who were appearing for their final exams, I told him to drop them in his police jeep,” Shobha Rani told TOI.
