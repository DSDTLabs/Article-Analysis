BHOPAL:   veteran and former chief minister   criticised the government over the tardy pace of implementation of the   rail project. He alleged that the project has gone into some 'bad business' (gorakh dhandha) and the government would never be able to bring metro rail in Madhya Pradesh. 

 "Madhya Pradesh is lagging behind other states in the country on the implementation of metro rail project. Recently, the Centre also changed its guidelines on the project, making it difficult to take a fresh initiative. Now, the government will have to prepare a new DPR (detailed project report) and get Cabinet approval again before implementing the project", Gaur told reporters at the state assembly.
 
 Gaur attacked 'babudom' in the administration and alleged that government failed to take help of E  , also known as Metroman for his contribution towards metro rail in the country. 
 
 "While preparing the DPR, Sreedharan was not consulted and it seems that all reports submitted by the state on building the metro rail will be rejected. Now, the project has gone into 'gorakh dhandha' and I could say that the government would never be able to bring metro rail in Madhya Pradesh", said the BJP veteran. Last month, Gaur taunted his own party by comparing the pace of metro rail in the state to that of late Prime Minister  's ' ' initiative.
