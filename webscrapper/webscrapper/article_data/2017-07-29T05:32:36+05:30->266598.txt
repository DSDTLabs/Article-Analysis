BENGALURU: As the   controversy rages on, a leaked document reveals   chief ministerial candidate  's doublespeak on granting independent religion status to Lingayats. 

  TOI accessed a memorandum copy sent by the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (AIVM) in 2013 to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, signed by prominent   leaders, including Yeddyurappa, seeking separate religion status for Veerashaiva-Lingayats. 
 
 This is in contrast to his opposition to chief minister Siddaramaiah's announcement that he would recommend the Centre to grant separate religion status for Lingayats. 
 
 "There is no difference between Veerashaivas and Lingayats and they are very much part of Hinduism," Yeddyurappa recently said.
 
 In the memorandum dated July 25, 2013, Shamanur Shivashankarappa, president of AIVM, an umbrella organization of Veerashaivas and Lingayats across the country, urged Singh to provide a separate code, number, column and abbreviation to record the religion of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community in the census form.
 
 The memorandum carries the signatures of all Lingayat MLAs and MPs of the state. "We, the undersigned people's representatives of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Goa and other parts of the country, comprising about 4 crore people from the community, gathered on July 25 and resolved to support the memorandum," the letter read.
 
 The Mahasabha also submitted a similar memorandum on July 7, 2013, to then Union home minister   to consider Veerashaiva-Lingayat a separate religion for the purpose of enumeration during the census, on par with other minority religions like Sikhism, Jainism and Buddhism, the letter pointed out.
