INDORE: The   (BARC) will not be able to afford making bulletproof jackets in bulk and that was the reason it was transferred to Mishra Dhatu Nigam (Hyderabad), however, the centre will provide all the required assistance in future, said   director K N Vyas at the   auditorium on Monday.

 Speaking about expansion of BARC at Atchutapuram Mandal of Visakhapatnam district, he said, the construction that is taking place in Vizag will be just another unit of BARC and nothing special. “The centre that is getting built at Vizag is just another expansion. Sometimes a place doesn’t have enough space for more expansion. I don’t mean about area. I am talking about the number of people since the increased number of people might affect quality.” 
 
 Vyas also shed light on his presentation that he had given on nuclear fuel design complexities and solution. “This presentation is not specific to the Indian reactors. This is as per the international conference. But, I can say that the fuel of the Indian reactors has also got improved. It’s an ongoing performance and a gradual process to ensure that the fuel failure doesn’t occur,” he said.
 
 Vyas had come to inaugurate a two-month programme, orientation course on accelerators, laser and related science and technology (OCAL). This certificate programme has got over 40 students enrolled from 15 states and 20 cities.
 
 “This is a residential course and we take only MTech and MSc students for this programme. We also provide them with a stipend of Rs 1500 per month plus lodging and food is provided at the centre’s guest house,” said RRCAT director   at the inauguration ceremony of the programme.
