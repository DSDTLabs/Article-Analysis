Ahmedabad: A team of city police’s Prevention of Crime Branch (PCB) raided a hookah bar on SG Road late on Wednesday and arrested the establishment’s manager. A search for the owners is on. Investigators said they found two 17-year-olds smoking a hookah inside, and those responsible will be charged according to sections of the new law.

 City police officials said that a team led by PCB ACP M K Rana raided The Fumes hookah bar at Dev-Arc Mall near Iskcon Crossroads at 8pm on Wednesday after receiving information that the place was providing backdoor entry to youngsters even though hookah bars are banned by the new law.
 
 “The team found multiple hookahs on the table and various flavours. It is suspected that a group fled from the spot when the raid began. The two found at the spot are class XII students,” said an official. 
 
 “Even according to the rules previously in place, no minor person could be given entry to a hookah bar. We have got the names of the partners as Rocky and Vijay and a search for them is on,” said an official, adding that Bharatnath Jogi, a native of Udaipur, Rajasthan, who was working as manager at the spot, was arrested. tnn
