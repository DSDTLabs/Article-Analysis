 Coming together for a holistic approach to address the issue, AALI, UP State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UPSCPCR), UP Mahila Samman Prakosht and   proposed the role of society, policing, education, better parenting and spreading legal awareness as the steps ahead. 
 
 “People at the grassroots are not even aware that child marriage is a punishable offence,” said Gurdip Singh, vice-chancellor, Dr  , where the colloquium was taking place. 
 
 Talking about the role of education and need for both social and sensitive policing, DG, UP Mahila Samman Prakosht, Sutapa Sanyal said, “At places where education is high in percentage, the percentage of child births is low.
