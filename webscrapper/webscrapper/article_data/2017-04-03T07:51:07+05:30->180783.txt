CHENNAI: The Centre has taken over personal security of former chief minister  , who is in the middle of a relentless tug-of-war with rival faction headed by V K Sasikala for the control of the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu. From now on, the leader will be provided   (CRPF) cover in the state under the Y-plus-category. 

  In a communication dated March 31, 2017, the Union home ministry informed the state director general of police that Panneerselvam has been included in the central list of Y-plus-category protectees. When contacted, DGP T K Rajendran, however, told TOI he could confirm receipt of such a communication only on Monday, since his office was closed on Sunday. Though Panneerselvam is already a Y-plus-level protectee, there are two significant aspects in the communication. 
 
 One, Panneerselvam will henceforth enjoy the CRPF protection in Tamil Nadu, though while travelling in other states he will have the security cover by the respective state police, befitting a Y-category protectee. Two, it does not give any reason for the Centre to virtually take over the personal security of the former chief minister, which is seen as an expression of no-confidence on an impartial and effective security cover by the state police. It is by far the most direct support that Panneerselvam has got from the Centre.
