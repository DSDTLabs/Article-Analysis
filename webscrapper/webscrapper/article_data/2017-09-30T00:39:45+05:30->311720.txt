New Delhi: Families of sewer workers, who lost their lives on job since 1993, will get some relief from the government. Delhi Jal Board on Friday, in pursuance of a 2014 Supreme Court order, passed a proposal to award a   of Rs 10 lakh each to families of the victims.

 In Delhi, at least 74 people have lost their lives since 1994 while cleaning sewers and septic tanks or in the process of trying to save someone who entered the drains. Data with the Safai Karamchari Andolan reveals that of the 74 documented cases, SC mandated compensation has been issued in only one case.
 
 “DJB has about 23-24 such victims. We will be awarding compensation of Rs 10 lakh to each family,” said an official. 
 
 Manual scavenging was banned in the country in 1993. The Act was amended in 2013 in light of the fact that the initial Act had made no difference to the situation on the ground. In 2014, SC had asked the state governments to “identify the families of all persons who have died in sewerage work since 1993 and award compensation”.
 
 With about 10 sewer-related deaths reported in the capital already this year, the government is trying to move to mechanical cleaning of drains. 
 
 Other than Delhi Jal Board, the other drain owning agency that employs manual scavengers is the corporation. Both agencies have a terrible track record of sending in workers without adequate protection or safeguards. Several incidents, where deaths of workers have occurred, also include private works.
 
 A large number of these deaths have occurred in groups with three to four victims collapsing in a single instance. Several of those who died had entered the pit or drain to save a colleague.
