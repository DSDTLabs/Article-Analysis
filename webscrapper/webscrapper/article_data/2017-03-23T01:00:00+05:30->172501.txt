Composer  , who is basking in the success of his recent album,  , says that competition doesn’t really exist in the industry. He goes on to say that he shares a good rapport with his fellow composers, too.   says, “If competition really exists, how do we all have a place? If you are willing to work hard and create something, there is no competition. Today, there are many new composers — Anirudh, Justin Prabhakaran, Leon James,   Prasanna, Santhosh Narayanan and Pradeep Kumar — and everyone is loved and appreciated equally. Only when you have the fear of losing something, you fear for competition. When you don’t have anything lose, it doesn’t make sense.” 

 Sean says that he’s cordial with other music directors and doesn’t think twice about call them when they work on a nice song. “I love all my peers and I call people personally whenever they are making amazing music. I called up Leon recently for the song, En Pulse Yethitu Poriye from Kavalai Vendam. Justin is a genius; his music is rooted and so native. Nivas has his own brand of music.   is a rockstar. I don’t think there is anything under the sky that he can’t do. I know this since I have personally worked with him. All of them are great,” says Sean, who is presently working on the music of VIP2.
