CHENNAI: Frequent power bill defaulters in   will soon have to pay for electricity in advance, with state-run transmission utility Tangedco preparing to replace existing analog and digital meters with smart meters.

 The smart meters, linked to a server, will function just like mobile SIM cards, said senior Tangedco officials.
 
 They will generate bills automatically, send due date alerts to postpaid consumers and disconnect power supply after a fixed period. The meters will disconnect supply to prepaid consumers once funds in their account dry up. 
 
 Officials have requested   to include Tangedco, along with other state power utilities, in the firm’s next tenders for supply of smart meters so as to slash its procurement price for the meters.
 
 “Gujarat, Puducherry, Chamundeshwari [Mysuru] and seven other discoms have floated tenders for smart meters. As many as 53,927 of a total of 1.72 lakh of these meters have been installed so far.
 
 Tangedco has sought inclusion in the tender process as the cost per meter is Rs 3,000 in a group tender. In the case of an individual tender, the cost per meter is more than Rs 7,000,” a senior Tangedco official said.
 
  “This is an upgraded version of the digital meter,” he said. “More than 80% of Tamil Nadu consumers have digital meters. All of them will be replaced in a year.”
 
 The meters will also do away with the visits, once every two months, by Tangedco staff to note meter readings.
