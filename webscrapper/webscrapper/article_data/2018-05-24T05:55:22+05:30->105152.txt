KAIRANA, SHAMLI: The fierce battle in  , where two political families are locking horns, is reaching new highs and lows on a daily basis. Talking to TOI, grand alliance candidate   on Wednesday claimed that BJP campaigners were making personal remarks about her.
 
 “A BJP leader had recently likened (BJP candidate)   with Goddess Lakshmi riding on a lotus and compared me to Surpanakha whose nose would be chopped off through my electoral defeat at Kairana,” Tabassum said.
  
 A former MP from Bahujan Samaj Party, Tabassum is the wife of late MP   and their son Nahid Hasan is local MLA from Kairana. Sources in the alliance claimed that she was an obvious choice not only because of her political lineage but also as a “masterstroke” to tap in to minority votes apart from Jats who are claimed to be supporting Ajit Singh’s RLD.
  
 Tabassum maintained that BJP had earlier floated the “exodus hoax” to polarise the residents on communal lines. “We have cordial relations with late Hukum Singh's family. Mriganka and I are dubbed as 'beti' and 'bahu' of Kairana. However, BJP tries to promote enmity on communal lines. Their exodus hoax was busted by NHRC,” Tabassum said.
 
 Commenting on the high-octane campaign by BJP, Tabassum claimed that BJP was rattled and has made its a prestige issue because a defeat at Kairana, shortly after defeats at Gorakhpur and Phulpur, would spell problems for them. “The grand alliance will become the official opposition in 2019 and BJP does not want the alliance to get this credibility,” she said.
  
 Tabassum brushed aside claims of any dent in the minority votes after her brother-in-law Kawar Hasan’s revolt. Kawar is now a Lok Dal candidate. “He has always been against us and this has never made much difference. People know the legacy of Munawwar Hasan and they have always been loyal to it,” Tabassum said.
