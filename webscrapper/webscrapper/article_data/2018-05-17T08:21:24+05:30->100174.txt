HYDERABAD: Stressing the need for focusing on children's health, the Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF) has recommended that   be incorporated into their curriculum and children be evaluated on the same, as part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation ( ) system. 

 Coming out in support of the   and Training's (TSCERT) recent decision to reduce the burden of project work by 50%, the teachers suggested that an innovative grading method be introduced, instead. They highlighted how excessive project work/exercises lead to serious health implications among kids - including neck/back pain and obesity. 
 
 "It is highly recommended that project work be abolished and some innovative grading be introduced, with weightage of 100 marks. Physical education is one area where children must be evaluated. And this should be implemented on priority basis. It should be part of the regular curriculum instead of being clubbed as co-curricular activities," said  , TPTF president.
 
 Teachers also suggested the inclusion of moral/value education, library period and life skills into the regular curriculum and requested the council to add these activities to the new CCE pattern.
 
 While council officials confirmed that they received various suggestions from all stakeholders, they said they are yet to consolidate the suggestions and take a final call. "We will be consolidating the suggestions and form fresh guidelines within a week or so. A committee will be looking into the suggestions that we have received and will decide whether or not to include them in the new CCE pattern," said B Seshu Kumari, TSCERT director, adding they are already assessing students in the areas of arts, culture and other co-curricular activities.
