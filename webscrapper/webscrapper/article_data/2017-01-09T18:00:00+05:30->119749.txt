On Sunday afternoon, the former merchant navy officer who killed his father in  , also blew up his neighbour’s house. And we have now found out that the house belonged to theatre and TV actress  , who plays   in the show ' ', which is being shot in Delhi. 

 The actress confirmed to us that she and her family were living in the now-burnt house, but couldn’t share any more details since she was in the middle of a shoot. A source informed us that even though she was not present in the house when the incident happened, her husband was. “People who are close to her tried talking to her about the incident, but she was not in the condition to talk. The entire family is in deep shock, they never even imagined that something like this could happen. The suspect locked himself up in their kitchen and switched on the LPG supply and blew up the house. Kiran also told a crew member that thankfully, her husband was not among those who were injured.”
 
 Though Kiran and her family lived in the apartment, sources say it was a rented accommodation.
