LUCKNOW: Decimated in UP assembly polls, BSP chief   on Wednesday announced that her party would go to court and resort to agitation against the BJP, which she said, tampered with the  . 

 Addressing media at party headquarters in Lucknow, Mayawati said that her party would organise agitations on 11th of every month in all district headquarters of UP and state headquarters of other states.
 
 The BSP was reduced to meagre 19 seats, down from 80 in 2012, even as BJP and its allies soared to 325 seats, one of the highest tallies in the recent history. The decline of BSP in UP polls have, in fact, come to threaten the political fate of BSP and its boss Mayawati.
 
 "We are not going to sit silently," an aggressive Mayawati said, adding that the BJP's victory was fake and orchestrated through 'cheating'. "The faces and language of BJP leaders says all about their fake victory," she added.
 
 She dared the BJP of getting repoll done through ballot papers to 'prove its honesty' in getting the assembly polls conducted. "But I know they would never do it. They are afraid that their fraud would be exposed," she said.
