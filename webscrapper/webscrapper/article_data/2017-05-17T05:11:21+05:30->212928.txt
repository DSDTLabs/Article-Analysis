SURAT: A family wanted to invite 1,001 Brahmins for a feast to fulfill a vow but could not locate as many from the city. The family searched for the Brahmins in Sanskrit pathshalas but failed and had to go to Nandurbar in Maharashtra just for the vow. 

 Kunal Shah, one of the family members, then resolved to be a software developer. He is final year student of MSc (IT) of   (BMIIT) of   in  . ‘Find Panditji’, a mobile application developed by him during his internship as an Android application developer, can be downloaded for free. People can locate pandits and also shop for puja materials easily thanks to this application.
 
 “This app has not been developed for commercial purpose. People need pandits but don’t know where to look for them. This app can help solve their problem by locating them. This application is social work,” said Shah. The app has a database of about 400 pandits living across the country and of more than 150 shops selling puja materials. The application has had more than 200 hits in the past four weeks. 
 
 “I am planning to enrich the database so that it can be of use to even people living abroad,” said Shah, who also has national record in his name for clicking most number of pictures of squirrels in an hour. Vijay Prajapati and Jay Paththwala had helped him in developing the mobile app.
