CHENNAI: While absence of exclusive   are already delaying disposal of road accident claims cases, apathy and insensitive approach towards compensation claims by presiding officers of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Chennai have prompted advocates to boycott   on Tuesday.

 The association’s vice-president   said, “In 2016, a division bench of the HC passed an order mandating disability assessment certificate from   in motor accident claim applications. As the order was implemented without forming exclusive medical boards for such cases, it resulted in piling up of cases before the board. In an attempt to find a solution, the association moved a clarification petition in 2017, in which another division bench of the court clarified that the presiding officer of the tribunals have discretion not to refer cases to medical boards, if they are convinced about the   produced by victims.”
 
 Exclusive boards for accident claim cases are not formed, and only one or two sittings per week are allotted for such cases. So far, nearly 400 cases are pending with the medical boards in Chennai, Selvaraj said.
