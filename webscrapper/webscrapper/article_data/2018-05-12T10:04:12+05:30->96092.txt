 The chairman of Kasturi Bharat Agarwal said, “Happy Streets Evening is a great opportunity to not only socialize but also have lots of fun and entertainment. It’s an amazing feeling to unwind on a street that is usually occupied by vehicles. Such carnivals happen all over the world and people within the vicinity must experience the energy at Happy Streets Evenings. My sincere thanks to the   and traffic police for permitting citizens to use the street.”
