 -   - Murali Gopy team's film ' ,' directed by Rathish Ambat, has been in news for a while for the movie's shoot getting stalled due to Dileep's arrest in the actress assault case.

 
  However, it looks like the team gave it their all, to compensate for the lost time. If the recently released teaser of 'Kammarasambhavam' is any indication, the movie tries hard to be a visual treat for the audience and says a story through various episodes from at least a century ago. Dileep, Siddharth and Murali Gopy are seen in their yesteryear avatars. A few days ago, the crew had told us how Dileep's look is fashioned after taking inspirations from director Lal Jose's and Dileep's dads' looks.
 
 The teaser also gives glimpses into the get ups of Shwetha Menon and the movie's leading lady, Namitha Pramod.
