MUMBAI: BEST launched a new   from   (W) on Tuesday. The service was introduced after the success of two such routes in south Mumbai. The new route, No. 662, from Goregaon   station uses midi buses and even connects two malls and the commercial hubs in the area. The first bus leaves at 6 am, the last at 9.30 pm.

 “The idea is to make our buses popular among   and to encourage reverse migration from share autos at Goregaon to the buses,” an official said. “The new circular route will be of benefit to scores of office-goers, locals and also tourists.”
 
 An official said every bus could replace about 10 taxis on the road, reducing traffic congestion, pollution and fuel wastage.
 
 The recently launched circular bus route No. 113 at Crawford Market draws more than 2,000 people, a reduction of at least 500 taxi trips. —Somit Sen
