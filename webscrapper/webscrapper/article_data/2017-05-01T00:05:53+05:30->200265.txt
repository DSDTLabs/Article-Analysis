New  : Six people, including two juveniles, have been held for thrashing a government schoolteacher with iron   on Friday after he refused to vote for a specific candidate in the recently concluded municipal elections in south Delhi’s Neb Serai. 

 The police said the accused were supporters of a local politician from Sangam Vihar who had lost the elections. The six accused, who claimed to be supporters of the candidate, had threatened the teacher, Kaptaan Singh, after he opposed the nomination. They alleged that Singh had launched a campaign against the candidate due to which he had lost. The teacher has a fracture in the right leg after the  . 
 
 The accused said they were angry as Singh had opposed their leader despite living in the same locality. “They attacked Singh to avenge their political leader’s defeat,” said Chinmoy Biswal, additional DCP I (south).
 
 Biswal said the four-minute attack was captured in three CCTV cameras installed at a garment shop. After mercilessly thrashing the teacher, the attackers left the crime scene on two motorcycles and a scooter, the video clip showed.
 
 “Though he was seriously injured, Singh himself called the police control room and reported about the attack. By the time a police team arrived, he was already moved to AIIMS Trauma Center. A case of attempt to murder has been registered on the basis of his complaint,” said an officer.
 
 Investigators scanned the CCTV footage from the garment shop and it helped them identify one of the suspects, Faisal alias Abid. Faisal was soon arrested and his interrogation helped the police team led by Kuldeep Singh, the SHO of Neb Sarai, to catch the rest. Besides the two juveniles, the others have been identified as Ajay, Amir and Kapil. 
 
 The police have seized a heavy steel rod, baton, scooter and a Pulsar bike from the accused.
