THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance special   here accepted the report of the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB), recommending a detailed probe in the case that was filed against former industries minister  . The court allowed the agency to undertake a detailed probe in the case, in which son of P K Sreemathy MP, P K Sudheer, and additional chief secretary (industries) Paul Antony also are the accused.

 It is learnt that the agency’s probe will now cover the office of chief minister   as well. “The detailed probe will also examine the role of chief minister’s office in the appointment of Sudheer only if anyone gives a statement that the file had also been sent to the chief minister’s office or there was some instruction from the chief minister’s office that influenced Jayarajan to appoint Sudheer,” sources said.
 
 It is also learnt that the vigilance would seek action against Paul Antony, as the FIR had said that he had conspired with the first accused and the appointment was made with his knowledge. According to the FIR, Jayarajan abused his official position and had conspired with K Sudheer and Paul Antony and issued an order on September 30, 2016 appointing Sudheer as the managing director of   (KSIE).
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded that the role of chief minister’s office in the whole series of incidents should be probed in-depth. He said that he would petition the agency with the demand at the earliest.
