BHUBANESWAR: The   ( ) will conduct a new survey of beggars to include them in rehabilitation schemes. 

 Earlier, the department of social security and empowerment of persons with disability (SSEPD) had said there were 53 'regular' beggars in the city. By this term, they had meant those who are not capable of manual work and for whom begging is the only means of earning a living. Such beggars are found mostly near temples.
 
 The BMC, however, said there were more beggars. "The BMC will use its own manpower to count the number of beggars in the city. We will need the help of the SSEPD department, especially with regards to the methodology used," said mayor Ananta Narayan Jena.
 
 Director of SSEPD Mansi Nimbhal said a meeting would soon be convened with the BMC officials for the enumeration of beggars and inclusion within livelihood programmes. "The new list will be out soon," she said.
 
 After identification, the beggars would be entitled to avail themselves of benefits under the   (NULM). "Under NULM, they will be made self-reliant. There will also be livelihood options for those who can't work at all," said an officer.
 
 Child rights campaigner Ghasiram  , who has done extensive research on beggars and the homeless, said, "There are around 6,000 homeless people in the city, out of which 60% beg for a living. Children of disabled persons also beg for a living," said Panda.
 
 The government must break the network which employs children as beggars near traffic posts. "I have given a proposal to the government to involve child rights campaigners, police and civic body authorities to start the rehabilitation of genuine beggars," Panda told TOI.
