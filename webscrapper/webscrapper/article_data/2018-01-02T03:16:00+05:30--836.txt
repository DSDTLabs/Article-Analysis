Keri: Two decked-up coconut trees near the road from Khandola to Savoi Verem are attracting the attention of nature lovers. 

 The trees along the left bank of the Mandovi river are covered by a large number of Dendrobium Ovatum  . The greenish-coloured flowers are found abundantly in several parts of the Western Ghats.
 
 Suryakant Gaonkar, from Bhuipal of Sattari, who has published a booklet on wild flowers of Goa, said, “During winter, trees with little foliage showcase the beauty of these attractive flowers. Though the flowers of these orchids are small, they are usually found in large numbers on an inflorescence plant.”
 
 Vitthal Shelke, a wildlife enthusiast from Sattari, said, “I was enthralled by the beauty of these orchids on the coconut trees.This is the first time I have seen these flowers bloomed in such a large number. Road widening and logging in the Western Ghats are responsible for degrading the epiphytic habitat of these orchids.”
