PUNE: The city crime branch on Wednesday arrested a   RTO agent from Jalna and his aide for allegedly stealing   after hiring them from travel and tour operators in Pune, Mumbai, Aurangabad and Jalna.

 “At least 12 of the stolen cars have been located and are being brought to Pune,” assistant commissioner of police (crime) Suresh Bhosale said. “Prima facie, the two are suspected to be involved in at least 50 car thefts over the last one year,” he added.
 
 Main suspect Sayyed Shakeel Sayyed Yusuf (38) of Buldhana and his accomplice Mohammed Ijaj Jallauddin Qazi (49) of Aurangabad were nabbed from Buldhana where senior crime branch inspector Nitin Bhosale-Patil and his team laid a trap following a tip-off. Yusuf had worked as an   in Jalna before engaging in car thefts, and was familiar with the vehicle registration and online process at the RTO.
 
 Bhosale said, “Yusuf would   cars and Qazi would help him sell these vehicles in Hyderabad, Warangal, Ahmednagar, and different cities of Karnataka. Yusuf would book the cars from Pune and Mumbai by using online booking facilities or by calling tour operators. He would insist on hiring only brand new   cars.”
 
 According to Bhosale-Patil, after hiring the car, Yusuf would ask the car driver to take the vehicle to Jalna or Buldhana districts. On reaching these places, mostly at night, he would ask the driver to take a dinner or tea break and keep the AC on in the car to enable him to sleep. To keep the AC running, the driver would have no option but to put the keys in the starter before leaving the vehicle. Yusuf would simply start the vehicle and drive away from the spot, police said.
 
 Bhosale-Patil said, “Yusuf had cases of car thefts registered against him at various police stations at Jalna, Aurangabad and Buldhana. Most of these cases involved criminal breach of trust.”
