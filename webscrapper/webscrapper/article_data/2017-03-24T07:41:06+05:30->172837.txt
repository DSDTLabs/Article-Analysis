NOIDA: Newly elected MLA   on Thursday asked district magistrate Nagendra Prasad Singh to remove a liquor shop in Sector 27 after the members of   Sector 27 reached his 17 Akbar Road residence in Delhi to raise their civic concerns. The RWA also highlighted the perennial traffic woes in the area and stressed the need for a community centre in the locality.

 “We filed petitions with DM Nagendra Prasad Singh several times regarding the removal of the liquor shop in the D Block market of the locality. But no action has been taken on the matter yet. So, we sought help from Pankaj in this regard,” said Rajeev Garg, RWA general secretary, Sector 27.
 
 Garg said the   directive prohibits setting up of any shop selling paan masala, cigarette, gutka or liquor within 500 metres of educational institutions. “This shop is in close proximity to Cambridge School,” he said.
 
 The RWA members also informed Singh that traffic diversions imposed in 2009 have turned out to be a safety hazard for residents. “In 2009, owing to the construction work for the Metro, traffic diversions were imposed for heavy vehicles crossing DSC Road and alternative routes were designated which covered the roads in residential areas here. Seven years on, buses and trucks continue to ply through blocks C, D, E and F despite repeated assurances from top Authority officials. The diversions were never rolled back,” said Moolchand Awana, president, RWA, Sector 27.
 
 The RWA also called for the setting up of a community centre in the area. 
 
 Pankaj gave a patient hearing to all the civic concerns and assured that he would hold a meeting with authority officials and RWA federation sometime next week.
