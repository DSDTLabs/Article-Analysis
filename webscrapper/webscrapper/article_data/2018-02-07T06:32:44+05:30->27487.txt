AHMEDABAD: In the next few years, we may soon have to   with its main streets witnessing frequent   during peak hours. Our   has begun to creak as we continue to overburden our roads by adding more vehicles which are bulkier. 

 These days, Amdavadis talk of traffic jams. They talk of the traffic jams they got into yesterday, and the ones they will probably get into tomorrow. The amount of vehicles we pump into our streets is phenomenal. 
 
 Recently, when   (IITM) conducted a vehicle density study on Ahmedabad roads, they found that some of arterial roads of the city were carrying 90,000 to 1.7 lakh in an 18-hour cycle. This comes to almost 5,000 to 9,444 vehicles passing by these routes in an hour. 
 
 The study found that Subhash Bridge circle saw nearly 1.7 lakh vehicles in 18 hours, followed by 1.22 lakh vehicles passing by on Nehru Bridge in the same time. 
 
 Raipur Darwaza, Naroda Patia and Expressway Crossroads see close to 1.01 lakh vehicles in 18 hours. “The IITM vehicle data was critical, as we also consider the emissions caused by these vehicles. The emissions released by 1 litre of diesel is equivalent to burning 10 litres of petrol. The vehicle count has revealed that light commercial, and heavy commercial diesel vehicles, with rising private diesel vehicles pose a serious concern for Ahmedabad,” says a senior AMC official. 
 
 The survey also found that among the 1.8 lakh vehicles that were counted every day on arterial stretches, four-wheeler petrol vehicles constituted 48% and diesel vehicles 30%, rest were CNG vehicles.
