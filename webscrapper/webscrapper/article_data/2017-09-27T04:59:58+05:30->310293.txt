MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government and the Central Bureau of Investigation ( ) on Tuesday said that a petition by former Maharashtra chief minister   to challenge grant of sanction to prosecution is not maintainable in the Bombay  .

 Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for CBI and state, said that the issue of grant of prior sanction needs to be gone into during trial before the special CBI trial  . He also said that the sanction was justifiable as there was enough material. He added that the new material against Chavan were the report of the two-member judicial commission and an observation made in a high court order last year.
 
 Governor   Rao had in April 2016 decided to sanction his prosecution for cheating and criminal conspiracy in the Adarsh cooperative housing society case. Earlier, the previous governor had refused sanction to prosecute Chavan. The arguments by Singh will continue on Wednesday before the high court.
