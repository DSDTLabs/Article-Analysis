If you’ve seen Anushka Sharma’s ‘NH10’, you already know that she isn’t one to produce a run-of-the-mill story. Well, for her second outing, Anushka has gone to the other end of the spectrum. If ‘
 ’ was raw and gritty, her latest production ‘Phillauri’ is quirky and lots of fun. But before you think it is just another laugh riot, let us remind you it is the no-nonsense Anushka at the helm of affairs – so ‘Phillauri’ is bound to be high on content.

 The 2-minute-55-second long trailer starts off with Suraj Sharma being asked to marry a tree since he is a 'maanglik'. But that’s not the least of his problems. After reluctantly getting married to a tree, Suraj’s character finds himself being haunted by a ghost named Shashi (played by  ). The ghost claims that since she resides in the tree, Suraj has unwittingly married her. What follows is a fun ride of events that trace back to Shashi’s life before she became a ghost.
 
 While Suraj is endearing,   as Anushka’s love interest is charming as ever in front of the camera. However, it is Anushka who steals the show as the friendly ghost, who even has a sense of humour to boot. The trailer, despite its light moments, has a melancholic undertone to it and promises a well etched-out story. 
 
 ‘Phillauri’, directed by Anshai Lal and produced by Clean Slate Films and Fox Star Studios, releases on March 24.
