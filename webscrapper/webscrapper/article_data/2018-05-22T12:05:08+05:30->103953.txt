Karnataka chief minister-designate HD   said on Monday that modalities of government formation had been decided with the Congress during his meeting with the party's president   and UPA chairperson  . 

 
 Talking to reporters after his meeting with the Gandhis, Kumaraswamy said Congress Karnataka in-charge KC Venugopal was travelling with him to the state "to discuss all matters and finalise everything" before his swearing-in as the chief minister on Wednesday.
 
 However, HD Kumaraswamy, 58, will have his hands full running the state and helming a coalition govt racked by differences. Here are his first hurdles, off the blocks:
 
 
 
 
 Kumaraswamy’s floor test is likely to be a smooth affair but he would have liked a speaker of his choice from JD(S). Congress has been eyeing the post as a means to control its ally and it might just have got its wish. Kumaraswamy has been generous for now but it might lead to some afterthought.
 
 
 
 
 HDK will have to do a delicate balancing act in allocating portfolios. It is not only about keeping influential individuals happy but ensuring all communities are represented. With Congress seeking two deputy CMs and some major portfolios his task is getting even more difficult.
 
 
 
 
 HDK won’t spare any effort in preparing for 9 bypolls in the next 2 months but will there be a seat-sharing pact with Congress? Right now the JD(S) has only 37 MLAs. He has to garner all his energy to win at least some seats independently to increase that number. 
 
 
 
 
 With the state dependent on the Centre for a large chunk of its revenue, Kumaraswamy has his task cut out. The CM-designate has the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water-sharing disputes to resolve as well, with the Centre expected to play a key role in both.
 
 
 
 
 Kumaraswamy has always been seen as a leader with limited appeal. He could not tour the entire state ahead of polls for health reasons. He has to strengthen the party and government before 2019.
