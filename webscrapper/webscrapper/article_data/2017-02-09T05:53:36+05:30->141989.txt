AMRITSAR: A section of Sikhs in the UK are outraged over goat sacrifice ritual allegedly carried out by some persons dressed in blue attire like that of ‘Nihangs’. They have approached   for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ) seeking an investigation into the act and also to stop any such event in future.

 Kesri Lehar campaign chief   informed TOI on Wednesday, “A video of the ritual has emerged wherein a group some 5-6 individuals dressed in blue ‘Sikh’ traditional attire has gathered in a closed venue, which appears to be a garage, to carry out slaughter of an animal that appears to be a goat or sheep.”
 
 He said as part of their inquiries as community activists, they had contacted persons shown in the video carrying out the animal killing. “They have not denied that it is them. They actually brashly say it was them,” Jagdeesh said.
 
 Quoting his various sources, he said it was a cult-like group, which posed as traditional Sikh warrior ‘Nihangs’.
 
 “Outraged by the video, UK Sikhs have calling upon the RSPCA, as the lead legal authority on animal welfare matters in the country, to urgently investigate this gruesome act and stop a repeat of any such act under the falsified guise of Sikhism. I and others have submitted an official online complaint to the RSPCA,” Jagdeesh said.
 
 He alleged that the group which carried out the slaughter ritual was a notorious and sought to conduct itself in a brash and aggressive manner; purporting to be ‘true Sikh warriors’.
