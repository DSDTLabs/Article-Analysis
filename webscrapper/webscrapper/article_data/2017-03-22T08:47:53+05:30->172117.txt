HYDERABAD: There is no place for illegal hoardings and unsightly posters in the   limits and any that spring up will be removed and action taken against the rule-breakers, municipal administration minister   has said. 

 Replying to queries during his visit as a guest editor to the TOI Hyderabad office on Tuesday, the minister made it clear that defacement of the city will not be tolerated. Be it political leaders or supporters of ministers, unauthorised posters and hoardings by everybody will be removed and action taken as per the provisions of the   Act. 
 
 Referring to some MLAs from the city accusing the state government of "infringement of democratic rights" of people to put up hoardings and banners, K T Rama Rao said he ensured that hoardings were not put up by his supporters on his and his father  's birthdays. 
 
 The minister went to the extent of asking how the legislators opposing the government's move to rid the city of illegal hoardings would feel if the walls of his house were defaced.
 
 Any one planning to erect a hoarding has to first seek permission from the GHMC and ensure that the hoarding meets all the structural stability norms and other relevant rules, he said.
