When RJ-turned-actor   was writing the script of his next,  , he had a dilemma. His team, including director   (of   fame) had zeroed in on a climax for the tale. In the course of writing, they thought that it could perhaps end differently, but were not sure how audiences would react to that line of thought. “We wanted a woman’s perspective on this, as the climax has something to do with justice being served to a woman. So, we sent both versions of the climax to about 250 women, and most of them chose the second one, which is what we have shot for in the film,” explains Rohitt. 
The film, which has Rohitt in the lead, also stars V  ,   and   in pivotal roles.
