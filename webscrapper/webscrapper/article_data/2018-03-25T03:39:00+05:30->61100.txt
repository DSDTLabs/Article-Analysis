Panaji: Around 16 agitators of the March 19 strike by mining dependents face detention by the Panaji police after failing to turn up in response to summons issued by the cops.  Police sources said a wireless message has been issued to police stations, including Calangute police station, to see that North Goa Taxi Owners Association leaders Laxman Korgaonkar and Vinayak Nanoskar respond to the summons. The association had extended support to the protesters. On Thursday, around 40 protesters had been issued summons by the Panaji police station. Another 22 summons were issued after that. As a result, 18 of them have filed for anticipatory bail, fearing possible arrest. Police are examining drone footage of the protest, based on which protesters are being identified. tnn
