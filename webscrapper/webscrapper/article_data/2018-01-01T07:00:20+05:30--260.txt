MANGALURU: Mangaluru police have initiated action against two constables after an aspiring actor accused them of   and her male friend, a Muslim. A video of the actor making the allegation went viral, forcing the   to conduct an inquiry as well.

 SP   said the woman and the youth were found near   temple on December 20. “As she was found moving alone in the night, she was brought to the local police station. It was found that she had left home without the knowledge of her family a few days ago,” the SP said.
 
 “The actor arrived at Subrahmanya temple on December 19 for a ritual to cure ‘sarpa dosha’,” a source from the Subrahmanya police station said. “As bachelors and spinsters are not given rooms in Subrahmanya, she slept at a dormitory in the temple premises. However, as she did not leave even on the second day, we acted on suspicion. By this time, the Muslim man had already met her. This further increased our doubts of some fishy developments,” a source said.
 
 The actor alleged that the police beat them and forced her to record a statement against the man, threatening to label him a terrorist, exterminate his family members and hinder his sister’s wedding if she refused to obey their orders.
 
 Subrahmanya policesaid they had only been curt with her as she was lying. The SP said the constables had acted in an “inappropriate manner”. He said, “Action is initiated against the constable and head constable and also thein-charge of thestation at that time for misbehaviour.”
 
 A source at the police station said the actor had pretended to be an orphan.
 
 She has been sent to her father while the young man has been sent home with his uncle.
