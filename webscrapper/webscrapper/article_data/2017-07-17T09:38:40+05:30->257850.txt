 The information was sent to IG Pon Manickavel, who visited the Coimbatore railway police station and conducted an investigation. Within a few hours, the same bag lifter confessed to the other crimes he had committed. He had taken away a few motorcycles parked on the roadside in   and sold them. 
 
 The detained person has been identified as Ajith, 23, from   in Madurai district. 
 
 IG Pon Manickavel told TOI that there is a huge gap between sub-inspectors of police to SP, DIG and IGP. When this gap is reduced, the investigation would be better. Many accused were very clever and reveal little information about the crimes they committed. The   may not get all the information from the culprits. So higher level officials have to supervise the investigation directly,
