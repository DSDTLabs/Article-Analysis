BENGALURU: In a bid to popularise the #AllToPoll campaign, the Election Commission has tied up with Facebook to improve polling percentage in the assembly elections on May 12.

 Chief electoral officer Sanjiv Kumar said Facebook recently approached them to create awareness among voters. “Our messages and videos will reach more voters this way, particularly the youth. We are also using #AllToPoll hashtag campaign on Twitter and Instagram, but we are yet to have any partnership with them,” he added.
 
 Facebook is likely to create reminders for the elections and expected to give more visibility to the poll panel’s online campaigns. Several NGOs, including Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC), are using #AllToPoll hashtag on Twitter to create awareness.
 
 Kumar said the commission has launched several campaigns among voters under the Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme.
 
 Scuba diving, flash mobs
 
 With the number of young voters having increased from 7 lakh in 2013 to 15.44 lakh now, the poll panel is charting out innovative drives to draw them to polling booths on election day. For instance, millennial voters (those born on January 1, 2000) of Uttara Kannada district will get free scuba diving passes.
 
 “In Bengaluru, we are planning flash mobs in major shopping malls to create awareness. We are thinking of organizing street plays and radio jingles in rural areas,” Kumar said.
 
 Poll song to be caller tune
 
 An election theme song, penned by lyricist Yogaraj Bhat in Kannada, stresses on the importance of voting and will soon be the caller tune of all election officials. Talks are on with major mobile service providers to facilitate the same and download the song for free.
 
 “We are in talks with IPL authorities to play the theme song during match intervals in Bengaluru,” said an official.
