The work I do is my passion. It is creative and fulfilling and I work with people whom I consider friends. My wife disagrees though. She thinks I need to get more sleep. She’s probably right. 
 
 
 
 Being married to my job in more ways than one, there’s hardly time to be fit but I try to hit the gym as often as I can.
 
 
 
 Good content and good food, not necessarily in that order.
 
 
 
 My position as a founder demands me to be both. I avoid micro-managing and trust my team enough to leave things to them. As an entrepreneur, taking risks is a daily task. A combination of both ensures we get stuff done.
 
 
 
 Food and travelling. I travel at every opportunity I get. I’ve visited over 40 countries and I aim to keep adding to that number in the years to come.
 
 
 
 Both failure and success are a part of life. I consider both to be a part of the learning process. Both are important in the grand scheme of things. It’s important to learn from one’s failures but I think it’s equally (or more) important to learn from one’s successes. That’s something I’ve tried to do in my personal and professional life.
 
 
 
 I try to fix the priority issues first.
 
 
 
 Cooking is extremely helpful for me to de-stress.

 Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi and Gulaal. Both these films moved me – literally. I moved from the US to India because of these movies!
