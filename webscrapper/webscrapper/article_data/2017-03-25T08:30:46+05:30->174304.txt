LUCKNOW: Speculations were rife as   patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s younger daughter-in-law,   and her husband Prateek went to meet CM   at VVIP guest house on Friday morning. While Aparna and everyone else in the family said that it was just a courtesy call, the 20-minute-long meeting drew huge interest in the state capital.

 Aparna, who has known Yogi Adityanath for a long time, said that the visit should not be seen through the political lens. "This is courtesy, not politics," she told reporters. Aparna was accompanied by her brother Aman as well. 
 
 Both Aparna and Yogi Adityanath, who was Ajay Bisht before taking sanyaas, belong to Garhwal in Uttarakhand. Aparna and Prateek, in fact, were the only one from the Yadav family to have paid a visit to Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur in September 2014, after the death of his guru Mahant Avaidyanath. 
 
 Aparna, who contested Vidhan Sabha elections from   seat and lost to Rita Bahuguna Joshi -- who now is a minister in Yogi cabinet -- did not take questions on her defeat. However, sources said that she was upset over her loss as she did a fine job. 
 
 "In 2012, Rita Bahuguna Joshi secured 63,000 votes and became a winner. Aparna secured 61,000 votes in 2017 which is not bad for a beginner especially from a seat that her party never won. She is evaluating the reasons at the moment," said a close friend.
