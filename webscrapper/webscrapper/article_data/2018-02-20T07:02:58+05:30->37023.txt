AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court is likely to hear a petition filed by an accused in the Rs 11,800 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam,  , on Tuesday in connection with a   in chit fund schemes.

 Choksi has filed a petition for quashing the FIR registered by city crime branch with the consent of the complainant, a Bhavnagar-based doctor, Meeta Mankad.
 
 However, the main accused in the FIR, a Bhavnagar-based jeweller, Digvijaysinh Jadeja, has been objecting to quashing of the FIR. He has urged the HC to join him as a party respondent in the petition. Jadeja has also accused Choksi of duping him by extending a franchisee of Gitanjali Jewellery Retail Ltd. He had requested the HC in July 2016 to stop Choksi from fleeing India.
 
 Claiming innocence in the chit fund case, Jadeja has submitted that Choksi and his associates have duped a large number of people by introducing chit fund schemes. “A thorough investigation is required to be undertaken as the same shall unearth a massive scandal, which has led to public cheating at large,” Jadeja’s petition reads.
 
 Jadeja submitted further, “The accused (Choksi), very slyly and systematically settled the issue with the complainant (Mankad) and paid back the sums to persons like the complainant to get the FIR quashed. However it is pertinent to note that general public has become victim of the modus operandi adopted by the accused.”
 
 Jadeja has claimed that Choksi and his associates are carrying on business in which general public is involved. If they escape from this FIR it will give them license to commit more such frauds in future and therefore the FIR should not be quashed and it should be continued, he has submitted.
