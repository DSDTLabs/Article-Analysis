Panaji: Costa Rica made it to the last-eight stage of the Fifa U-17 World Cup during the last edition in Chile, 2015. This time around, Los Ticos are confident they can do even better when they take on the might of Germany in their opening clash at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on October 7. “The last edition in Chile was very good. We had a brilliant tournament. Our objective this time is to try and improve on that performance. However, we do know that each tournament that we participate in is different and come with their own challenges. The aim will be to try and improve on what we did last time,” Costa Rica coach Breansse Camacho told TOI in an exclusive interview. Camacho took over the reins of his country’s side a year ago from Argentinean Marcelo Herrera, who he had assisted in Chile.  The 46-year-old has held numerous roles as assistant and coach in various Costa Rican youth sides.
