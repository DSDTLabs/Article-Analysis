BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Saturday asked colleges receiving government assistance to ensure a digital payment gateway for students. 

 "I request you to impress upon all the aided colleges (which get financial assistance from the government) across the state to set up required infrastructure in order to facilitate payment of any kind of fees or any service being provided to the students through any of the digital payment mode: internet banking, credit/debit cards, Aadhar-based POS or   system at no extra cost to students," wrote Akshay Mohanty, joint secretary to government to higher education director  .
 
 A government officer said the plan is to ensure digital payment in all institutions of the higher education department, as suggested by the ministry of human resource development. "The institutions not having digital payment facility will face problems in availing government aid after a cut-off date," he said.
 
 The government is also working out the specifics for implementing digital payment options for the colleges directly run by it, he added.
 
 The higher education department conducts Plus II and Plus III admissions in a centralised online process. However, the fees are collected offline by the respective colleges. "This time, the plan is to provide an additional option of digital payment to students," he said.
 
 Similar options are to be given for all other kinds of payments, ranging from hostel fees to college canteens.
 
 In another development, the state government has planned universal Aadhar enrollment for all students between Class IX and Class XII. 
 
 Technical education secretary  , on Friday, wrote a letter to his counterpart in school and mass communication,  , to undertake a special drive for these students. "Due to want of Aadhar cards, Plus II students are facing problems in applying for JEE MAIN and NEET, for both of which Aadhar is mandatory," Singh said, explaining why the move was initiated.
