PATNA: Former deputy CM   has said that the cooperative society meant for allotting land to Bihar MPs and legislators for construction of house is under the “grip” of   chief   and rules are being flouted at will to benefit favoured few.

 Former Union minister   of RJD is the chairman of the society. Lalu’s another confidant  , who was elected to the state assembly for the first time in 2015, is its secretary.
 
 Alleging irregularities in the land allotments by the cooperative body, Modi on Wednesday appealed to CM Nitish Kumar to dissolve the committee and appoint an administrator for it. He also demanded that the documents related to the allotments be made public.
 
 Modi said Jay Prakash and Bhola had been made the chairman and secretary only to “cover up” the violation of rules. He also dared Jay Prakash to release the list of all the lawmakers who have been allotted plots of the society even though many of them had separate private houses in Patna.
 
 Talking about his own experience, Modi said his name figured at serial number 384 in the 663-member society. Yet, he was never invited to attend the meetings of the society. Nor has he been given any information to participate in the internal election of the society, he said.
