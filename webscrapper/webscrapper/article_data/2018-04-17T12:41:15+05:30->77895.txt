PANAJI: Cardiologist Dr Jagan Hanumanthu, who a few months ago was appointed professor at the cardiology department of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, has resigned. Health minister   confirmed that Hanumanthu had put in his papers. “We will advertise the post on priority and fill it,”   said.

  Hanumanthu was brought on board and appointed professor to pave the way for starting DM cardiology, a post-graduate cardiology course, from the 2018-19 academic year. His exit comes as a blow to the GMC’s chances of starting the course. Earlier, the Medical Council of India had rejected GMC’s proposal to start the course under Dr  , who currently heads the department. 
 
 A source close to Hanumanthu said that he was upset at not being appointed head of department (HoD), despite him having the requisite qualification and experience. However, a government official said that Hanumanthu was asked to resign after it came to light that he allegedly registered himself as a professor with a university in Hyderabad. 
 
 This, he said, came to light while documents were being collected to be submitted to the MCI for permission to start DM cardiology. 
 
 But Rane said that the process to strengthen the department is under way. 
 
 “It is doing extremely well,” Rane said. “Cardiologist Amar Prabhudessai has joined recently whereas another will join next week.”
