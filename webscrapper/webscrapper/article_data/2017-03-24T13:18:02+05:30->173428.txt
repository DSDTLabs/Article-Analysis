VISAKHAPATNAM: A  , which had suffered wounds,   near   in the early hours of Thursday. 

 Measuring around one-and-half to two feet in length and suspected to belong to the Delphinus Delphis species, the calf was spotted by children of fishermen near the area. The children who found the dead dolphin said it had been injured near the stomach when it washed ashore. A bigger dolphin had washed ashore dead near the Pedajalaripeta area in April last year. 
 
 Pointing out that the December to March is the breeding season for dolphins, Prof MS Chakravarthy of the marine living resources department at Andhra University said, “Usually, it is during this time of the year they come close to the shore because of the breeding season. We can’t determine the cause of death without seeing the specimen and noting the injuries.” 
 
 “The dolphins usually come upto the breaker zone, where the waves break and they are normally seen in pairs,” he said. 
 
 Judging by the size of the calf, he said the age of the dolphin may be around three to four months. “The dolphins normally are seen up to the continental shelf, which in the case of Vizag stretches to about 25 miles from the coast. Beyond that there is a sudden slope, so they won’t go beyond that level.”
 
 An Olive Ridley Turtle was also found dead opposite to the Aqua Sports Complex on Thursday morning. Eye-witnesses said the turtle had died on Wednesday night or early hours of Thursday.
