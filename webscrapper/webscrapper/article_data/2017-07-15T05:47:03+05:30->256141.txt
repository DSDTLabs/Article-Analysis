Kalyan: A   in   that was sealed by the Thane   in June after it was found to have been operating with rigged fuel dispensers, was   after locals complained that it had illegally restarted operations. 

 In June, the crime branch had sealed seven petrol pumps in the area, including Shinde petrol pump. But the petrol pump owner, Rajbahadur Yadav, said, “The crime branch had only sealed the rigged dispensers. We were using those that had not been sealed.”
