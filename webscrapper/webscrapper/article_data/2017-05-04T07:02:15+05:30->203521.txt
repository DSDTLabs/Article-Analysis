BENGALURU:   CEO   said that the 4G roll-out in India is the fastest he has ever seen in the world and that it opens a great opportunity for Apple to grow in the country over the next few years. Apple sales in India,   said, grew at double digits and set a new record in the March quarter.
 
 In an earnings call with investors after the announcement of the quarterly results, Cook said the company has been investing money and energy in the country , encouraged by the 4G network growth. “The 4G network investment really began rolling in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year.But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive,“ Cook said. With sales slowing for Apple in the US and China, investors are looking to see if growth in India can compensate for this. 
 
 Apple, one of the world's most valued companies, sold 50.76 million iPhones globally in the first quarter of the calendar year, down from 51.19 million it sold during the same period of the previous year. In India, sales have been surging, and in the premium smartphone segment (Rs 30,000 and above), it has been battling   for the top slot. In the January-March quarter, Samsung replaced Apple as the top premium smartphone vendor with a 48% marketshare, up from 31% in October-December, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Apple's share dropped to 43%, from 62%.
 
 Cook said India's young demographic and rising income levels are making the company hopeful about growth in India. “We have been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there,“ he said.Apple is setting up a manufacturing plant in Bengaluru. It also has an R&D facility in Hyderabad focused on developing Apple's maps.
