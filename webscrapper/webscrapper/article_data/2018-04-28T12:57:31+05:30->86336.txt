Director Tinu Pappachan’s debut movie   has found both critical and commercial success, with many lauding the filmmaker for the jail-break movie. Reports are rife that the director has now planning a film with   and   in the lead.

 However, when we contacted Tinu, he denies any such plans. “I had visited Prithviraj a few days ago. I think that’s what got the rumour started. There’s no movie planned with him yet,” says the director.
 
 Meanwhile, there were also reports that Tinu would helm the Tamil remake of Swathanthryam Ardharathriyil with actor Jeeva playing Antony’s role. Tinu though tells us, “The discussions for the Tamil remake is ongoing but I haven’t decided if that will be my next project.”
