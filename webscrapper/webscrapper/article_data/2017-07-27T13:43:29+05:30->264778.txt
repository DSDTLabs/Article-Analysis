CHANDIGARH: Even though three PGI doctors have contracted   (H1N1 virus) recently, most doctors still shy away from taking the preventive vaccine.

 Doctors of the Sector-16 Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) received the vaccine on June 6 but antibodies take at least two weeks to get activated. Also, a circular to their colleagues in the   reminds them to be immunised against the flu. Still, only 30 doctors have taken the shot. 
 
 “Within two weeks, we have vaccinated 200 doctors and health workers at the GMSH-16. In two months, we have supplied the PGI (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) with 180 vials of H1N1 vaccines but not taken an account how many were utilised,” UT health department anti-malaria nodal officer Dr Gaurav Aggarwal said.
 
 Within a month, 10 H1N1 cases have been confirmed in the city. Two of the patients have died. A 60-year-old woman from Maloya died on Tuesday. The season’s first flu-related death was reported on July 20. The PGI says it has vaccinated 42 doctors and health workers against the virus, though it has more than 1,800 doctors, and more than 6,000 visitors to the outpatient departments (OPDs) daily.
 
 The new strain of the virus is Michigan. “Last year, it was California. Strains vary from year to year, and so we recommend annual vaccination against the flu, for the health workers, especially,” said Dr Aggarwal. The three PGI doctors tested positive on Tuesday are from departments of nephrology, psychiatry, and paediatric medicine. One of the doctors contracted the flu while tending to her five-year-old child.
 
 “Why are the doctors reluctant for the prophylaxis (treatment given or action taken to prevent disease)? H1N1 influenza virus vaccine may not provide every person with protection from disease. Also, there are many side effects, including severe lower-back pain, slow heart rate, unusual bleeding etc.,” said a doctor from the PGI.
