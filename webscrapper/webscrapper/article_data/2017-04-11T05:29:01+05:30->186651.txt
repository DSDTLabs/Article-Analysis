NEW DELHI: Survey of India, the oldest scientific establishment in the country, launched on Monday a portal - ‘nakshe’ (maps) - which will allow free download of ‘open series maps’ (OSMs) for public use and announced that it would “re-measure” the height of   this year as an   joint scientific exercise.

 The login access to the ‘nakshe’ will be provided to public via   process. Users can download all the topographic maps or the OSMs, containing natural and man-made geographical features, in the PDF format on 1:50,000 scale.
 
 Launching the portal on the occasion of the Survey of India’s 250th anniversary, the Union science and technology minister   said the idea of providing “open and free maps” to public arose when he visited the institute last year. “I felt the wealth of data can be used by public,” he said.
