AIZAWL: The match between   and   at   here on Thursday was very similar to classic rock songs from the 1970s.

 It began slowly like a ballad but gradually picked up momentum and then ended in a flourish. But unlike a great song that leaves people ecstatic, fans at the stadium burst into anger after the match that ended 1-1.
 
 After a goalless first-half, both the coaches made a flurry of changes hoping to break the deadlock and it was the home team who drew first blood when   came off the bench to score the opener in the 73rd minute.
 
 But even before the jubilant fans could settle in their seats, Bagan were awarded a penalty and  , who came in place of Aser Pierrick Dipanda Dicka in the 32nd minute, converted it to bring back parity into the match in the 78th minute.
