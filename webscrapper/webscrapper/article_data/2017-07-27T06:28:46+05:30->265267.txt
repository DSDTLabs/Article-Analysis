JAIPUR: The higher education department on Wednesday decided to introduce biometric attendance system in colleges at divisional headquarters from the ongoing academic session to tackle the issue of students bunking classes.

 It has also decided that professors will also have to punch their biometric attendance twice a day i.e. during their entry and exit. Currently, they were using their biometric card only during the entry.
 
 Higher education minister   said, “During my visit to Bharatpur recently, some students had come forward with the suggestion of   attendance system in colleges. I found the suggestion very positive and considered at the meeting held on Wednesday.”
 
 She added, “Initially, we thought of launching the system from Bharatpur and gradually extending it to other areas on demand. But since the idea is good to address the issue of absenteeism in colleges, we have decided to introduce it at all the seven divisional headquarters from this  
 
 The minister said, it could be gradually introduced in all the colleges in the state.
 
 This system is tamper proof and there is no scope for complaints, said the minister.
 
 Maheshwari said, the biometric attendance system for the   would be made mandatory in the morning as well as in evening on entry and exit from the college. At present though bio metric system is in vogue they had to punch only on in the morning on entry and not for exit.
 
 She said, as per the decision taken on Wednesday, the faculty now had to punch their attendance in the morning as well as in the evening. This would ensure that the faculties remaining in the college throughout the day and the students have no scope for complaints of absenteeism of the professors, she said.
