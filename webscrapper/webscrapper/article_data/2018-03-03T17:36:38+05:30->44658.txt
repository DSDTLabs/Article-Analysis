A magazine cover photo is the talk of the town in Kerala. In the photo, a woman is shown as breastfeeding a baby, with the caption, 'Don't stare, Kerala, please let us breastfeed.'

 The photo has been getting mixed responses, with some saying that the effort and the message behind it should be lauded, while others criticised it as a gimmick. The woman in the model is not the mother of the child, and not a mother at all, and so the purpose of the message is lost, they said.
 
 Meanwhile, a lot of men and women have come forward with praises, actor   among them. "This is an iconic cover. The picture speaks a million words. In my life time I have never seen such a thought provoking and odacious cover by any Indian magazine, (sic)" she wrote, comparing the model to  , the first black woman to ever appear on the cover of a magazine. "This cover will have similar impact and will go down in the history as one of the greatest covers of all time not just by a Malayalam magazine but in any Indian magazine ever."
 Lissy also congratulated the team of the magazine and the model,  . "Gilu Joseph, you are a wonderful woman. You look a "million dollor. (sic)"
