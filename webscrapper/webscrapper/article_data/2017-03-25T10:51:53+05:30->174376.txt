NAGPUR: The national ranking of   may have slipped little bit due to injuries last year but she is still one of the major players as far as domestic circuit is concerned.

 The ace city shuttler underlined this fact by displaying glimpses of her old form to storm into the final of the All India Senior Ranking   tournament at Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, on Friday.
 
 On the penultimate day of the competition, Arundhati was in top form and knocked out couple of top players to book her place in the women’s singles summit clash.
 
 The unseeded shuttler began her day in style by brushing aside the challenge of Pune youngster   21-11, 23-21 in 40 minutes. Arundhati wrapped up the first game quite easily but needed to stretch herself fully in the extended second game.
 
 After few hours of rest, Arundhati was again back on the court for her semifinal battle against sixth seed  . Arundhati and Uttejitha train together at the Hyderabad-based Pullela Gopichand Academy but they never played a competitive match in any tournament before.
 
 The former India No. 1 Arundhati overcame a mid-match slump to upset Uttejitha Rao 21-15, 20-22, 21-3 in 43 minutes.
 
 “I should have won the match in straight games. I had four match points in the second game but from 20-16, I lost the game. However, I increased the pace of my game in the third game and completely dominated her,” said 28-year-old Arundhati.
 
 On Thursday, Arundhati had shocked fourth seed Neha Pandit in straight games 21-17, 21-18 in the second round.
 
 Bareilley is happy hunting ground for Arundhati, who won her maiden All India title in 2010 after beating Sanyogita Ghorpade in the final. If Arundhati manages to beat Shriyanshi in the final on Saturday, it would be her second title at the same venue.
 
 In the other semis, third seed Shriyanshi rallied back to oust Riya Mookerjee 17-21, 21-19, 21-15.
 
 However, it was curtains for other city shuttler Vaishnavi Bhale. After stunning top seed Reshma Karthik in straight games in the second round on Thursday, Vaishnavi flattered to deceive in the quarters against Riya Mookerjee. The talented city shuttler Vaishnavi put up a brave fight in the first game but went down 21-23, 8-21 in 37 minutes.
 
 The pair of Vaishnavi and Riya Pillai (Mumbai) crashed out in the women’s doubles against third seeds Kuhoo Garg and Ningshi Block Hazarika 11-21, 21-15, 17-21.
 
 Another promising city shuttler Mugdha Agrey lost against Shriyanshi 13-21, 10-21 in the women’s singles second round on Thursday.
