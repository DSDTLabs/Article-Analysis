PATNA: Two main   parties of the state – RJD and   – which had wholeheartedly taken part in the human chain in support of total prohibition in the state last year, boycotted the event this year terming it as a “super flop”.

 “CM  , with a repent, might have realised the unmatched mass support of RJD. The last year’s human chain, in which the RJD and the Congress participated, had created a world record. Today, when BJP is with him, the human chain created a record of flop. People have given a clear message that Nitish Ji will now sit alone at home and create a human chain on paper,” leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted on Sunday. 
 
 RJD state president Ram Chandra Purbey said only schoolchildren, teachers and state government employees participated in the human chain. “The chain remained broken here and there as common people didn’t turn up,” he said.
 
 Congress spokesperson and former MLA Harkhu Jha said unlike previous year’s human chain, the one this year turned out to be a “government road show” as only government employees and schoolchildren could be seen. “There was lack of enthusiasm even among workers of the ruling parties,” he said, adding the CM should have convened an all-party meeting and sought support of RJD and Congress.
