PUNE: An   has accused the institute brass of evicting him from his hostel room in an inhuman way and neglecting the diploma film he is working on.

 FTII officials rubbished the allegations and said enough time was provided to the student (editing) to complete his project. 
 
 Abhinav Kashyap, who started classes at   (FTII) in 2011, was evicted from his room last week. Since then, he has been living in an adjacent room allotted to a friend. 
 
 The   served three notices to him over the past month to vacate the room, else he had to pay a penalty of Rs 500 a day. Kashyap said he had suffered a fracture in his right leg and despite appeals to treat his case on medical grounds, his belongings were packed when he was in Mumbai last week.
 
  “Almost all   have submitted their films and left the campus. We give students a lot of time to complete their projects. The sound designer assigned to Kashyap’s team waited for long for inputs. As a result, the deadline was not met,” said Amit Tyagi, dean of film at FTII. “They submitted a cut of their film but refused to make titles. The project will be judged in that state,” he said. 
 
 “The medical condition that the student has been talking about happened after the deadline. He wanted a deadline extension to submit the project and vacate the hostel because of his broken leg. We gave him a few more weeks as his leg was plastered. But the rooms have to be vacated as new students are about to come in,” Tyagi added.
