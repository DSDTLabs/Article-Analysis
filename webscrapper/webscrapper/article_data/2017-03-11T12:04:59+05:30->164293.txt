 The newly elected local corporator of the area,  , and a team from the  , visited the slum separately on Friday and interacted with the slum dwellers. 
 
 “We will see to it that the slum has a community tap to collect water. Those who pay property taxes for their dwellings will get separate water connections in their homes,” assured an NMC team member.
 
 This comes in the wake of the TOI’s March 10 report on the plight of the around 500 residents, who are forced to use water for their daily needs, including drinking and cooking, from a community toilet. 
 
 The slum was established nearly five decades ago and is inhabited mostly by tribals who work as labourers. They have ration cards and take part in the voting process. Yet, they have been living without an NMC water connection for years together. 
 
 “Our plan is to lay a pipeline connecting the slum to the one that we are laying and set up a community tap. We will complete the task as soon as possible,” said the NMC official. 
 
 Donde said after interacting with the slum residents, he had a meeting with the local NMC officials. “The NMC authorities have assured me that they will ensure that the slum gets drinking water in the shortest possible time. I will continue to take feedback from them till the work is done,” he said.
