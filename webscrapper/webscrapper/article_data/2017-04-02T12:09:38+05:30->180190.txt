 may have decided to not play a superhero on-screen but the actor played a life saver for co-star   when he rescued him from fire.

 "It started to get late and some of the pyrotechnics got a little bit too hot. We burst out of the building. It looked great on camera. We didn't know it (during the stunt), but it was pretty intense. I watched playback, and he saved me from a burning building. It later exploded that night. It was a set, but it later burned down," Efron said.
 
 "Hugh Jackman saving you from a burning building? It's every girl's dream," he joked. 'The Greatest Showman,' about PT Barnum (Jackman), founder of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, is due out Christmas Day.
