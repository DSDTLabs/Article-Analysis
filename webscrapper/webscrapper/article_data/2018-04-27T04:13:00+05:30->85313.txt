Vadodara: The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) on Thursday hired IL&FS to conduct feasibility study for the proposed international cricket stadium at Kotambi on Halol Road. The decision was taken during the managing committee meeting that was summoned for discussing several issues. “IL&FS quoted Rs 21 lakh for conducting the study and entire managing committee unanimously decided to give the job to the firm. They will have to submit the report within three months,” said Amul Jikar, BCA treasurer. The association will also build a wall around the land. The managing committee also formed a special committee to take decisions on the number of teams to play in the premier league and the grounds to be hired. The move seems to be a fallout of BCA’s recent decision to disallow Darshanam’s team in the premier league.  Some members of the managing committee disapproved of the decision as they felt that BCA needs good teams and also cricket grounds to play. A BCA official said that Darshanam was offering good cricketing facilities. “Apart from me, the new committee will have Narayan Satham, Khagesh Amin, Jatin Vakil and three BCA office-bearers. This committee will decide on the teams that will play in the premier league and the grounds to be allotted,” said Cassim Unia, managing committee member.
