LUCKNOW: The former public relations officer of Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya has lodged an FIR against the   from Kunda for operating a bank account in his name fraudulently. 

 Rajiv Kumar Yadav was associated with Raja Bhaiaya between 2004 and 2008 before parting ways acrimoniously. 
 
 Yadav alleged that Raja, his wife, two accomplices and the manager of a bank in Bahraich had opened an account in his name and used to launder money through it.
 
 Circle officer of Bahraich city Vijay Shanker Mishra said that an FIR had been registered on Wednesday under IPC sections amounting to forging valuable security, cheating, criminal intimidation and impersonation.
 
 “The complaint states that the said account was allegedly being operated since 2010 and Yadav’s signatures were being forged for transactions,” said Mishra.
 
 Raja Bhaiya was not available for comment and text messages to him remained unanswered till late Thursday night.
 
 Yadav got the FIR registered after the court’s intervention as police had refused to entertain his complaint forwarded to Bahraich police early this year. Issuing a contempt notice, the court summoned Dargah Sharif SHO and subsequently an FIR was lodged. SHO JN Shukla said the charges were being examined all this while.

 Yadav told police that staff in the Dargah Sharif branch of the private bank was aware of the forgery but instead of suspending the account, allowed Raja to keep using it. He added he had written to the bank in the past and posted his grievance through registered post. 
 
 “We will probe the matter and take a decision in a few weeks,” said Shukla. Yadav had made similar complaints against Raja in the past.
 
 In 2011, Yadav had approached CBI alleging Raja Bhaiya was involved in a food grain scam during his tenure as food and civil supplies minister during the Mulayam Singh Yadav government.
