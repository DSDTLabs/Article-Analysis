BELAGAVI: Expressing concern over the recent busting of an illegal  ,   leader and advocate   has asked the district administration to address the issue immediately. He said that the revelation of 389 fake voters at Kasai Galli could pose a threat to the country's internal security. 

 Addressing reporters here on Saturday, he said that the fake voters - most of them belonging to a particular community - had given a house bearing survey number of 2438 at Kasai Galli as residential address proof. "The irony is that the house had collapsed long ago. Not even a single person stays there now. While registering as voters of the North assembly segment, the survey number has been continuously bifurcated with the extension numbers. The enrollment of 389 voters with the same address is the tip of iceberg. There could be around 20,000 fake voters in   segment," said Benake.
 
  When a team of volunteers applied for the copy of forged   survey number certificate, the local body rejected the application with a note that no such survey is available, he said. "The district administration should correct lapses in the voters' list by June 1. Otherwise, we will hold protests," warned Benake.
