JAIPUR: Police officials seldom celebrate promotions with their families. But it was different on Monday when 86 assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) were promoted as sub-inspectors. Emotions were on full display when the names of these sub-inspectors were announced at the   for which the families of cops were invited for the first time.

 Usually, whenever officers of the lower constabulary are promoted, they just receive a letter and celebrations are not a part of it.
 
 However, to give them a moral boost and confidence,   commissioner   started this initiative of organising a ceremony while promoting ASIs as SIs with their families.
 
 54-year-old Hukum Singh, who was promoted as SI, attended the function with his wife Amarjeet Kaur and son Amrinder Kaur. “I am deeply motivated by this gesture from my seniors. My son and wife are accompanying me and it’s an acknowledgement of the hard work that I have put in for this promotion. It is a satisfying moment for me,” said an elated Hukum Singh.
 
 Similarly, 53-year-old Karan Singh was happy that his two grandsons, Udbhav Pratap Singh (3) and   (2), were able to be present while their grandfather was being promoted.
 
 “I hardly get time to see them together. I must thank my seniors for giving my family an occasion to share my success,” Singh said.
 
 Vikas Pathak, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said, “Policemen work in very tough conditions. I think such occasions actually give them a moral boost and enhance self-esteem. Similar programmes will be organised in future too. Such things are actually needed to keep the spirits up.”
 
 “I am thankful to senior officers for giving my husband this opportunity. I hope he continues to scale heights and work with sincerity and dedication,” said Sarita Sharma, whose husband Chandra Mohan Sharma was also promoted.
