MUMBAI: Slamming the   government for botching up the Hindutva campaign for cow protection,   has called for a uniform policy on the issue to save ' ' from police crackdown. 

 Referring to the Jharkhand court's latest judgement awarding life sentences to 11 cow crusaders for killing one person, Saamna said the Jharkhand 'gau rakshaks' BJP will have to pay a heavy price for pursuing the party's cow campaign.
 
 With states framing their own rules, the Centre's cow policy has met the same fate as demonetisation, the Ram temple issue and GST, said the   mouthpiece in an editorial on Friday.
 
 "Some states have framed stringent laws on cow slaughter, while in Mizoram and Goa there is no ban on consumption or sale of beef. While some states have made a provision for life imprisonment for killing a cow, in others there is a jail term of only five to ten years. Such discrepancy has created confusion across the country...In Tripura, where the BJP has won the state assembly, the party now says that citizens are free to eat beef. In short, the BJP policy is 'eat beef, but vote for our party'," said Saamna. Saamna also insisted that farmers should be given financial aid to take care of unproductive cows.
 
 A delegation of anganwadi workers met Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at Sena Bhavan on Friday to thank him for his party's support to their stir. 
 
 In an order issued on March 15, the Maharashtra government had invoked the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2017, to ban the strike of anganwadi workers.
 
 However, Sena MLAs strongly opposed MESMA in the state legislative assembly on Thursday following which the state government stayed its order. The anganwadi workers thanked Thackeray for Sena's support to their cause.
 
 Talking informally to mediapersons, Thackeray said instead of rolling out the red carpet to the mercantile class, the government should stand by anganwadi workers.
