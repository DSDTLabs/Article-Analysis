Shimla: Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh delivered the longest ever budget speech lasting for four hours and thirty minutes on Friday. Last year, his budget speech had lasted for three hours and twenty five minutes.

 The chief minister was presenting the budget for record 20th time and read the 80-page document. Urban development minister Sudhir Sharma said delivering such a long speech by standing for four and half hours was not an easy task but Virbhadra has set an example for young leaders. He said Virbhadra is the second chief minister of India to present budget for the 20th besides Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling.
 
 Virbhadra (83) had become the chief minister of HP on April 8, 1983, and same year he had presented his first budget. Each time on becoming chief minister, he had kept the finance portfolio with him. In December 2012, he had become the chief minister of state for record sixth term.
 
 Leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal reacting to the budget speech, said the gist of the speech was that 66% funds will come from the Centre, while remaining 22% will be loan. It is clear that budget was of total 12% funds for which Virbhadra delivered such a long speech which was not required. He said that in 2007, after Hamirpur bypoll, BJP had formed government. He said Congress is opposing by-election in Bhoranj but history will repeat itself.
