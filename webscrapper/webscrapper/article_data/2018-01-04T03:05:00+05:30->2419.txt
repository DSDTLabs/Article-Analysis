Panaji: The Goa government has given administrative approval to award the tender for construction of a superspecialty block at Goa Medical College ( ) and Hospital to the lowest bidder, Rama Civil India Construction Pvt Ltd, at the quoted amount of Rs 249 crore.

 Health minister Vishwajit Rane, who has been pursuing the project since he became minister last March, said the flagship project has been pending for the last three years.
 
 One of the main reasons for the project getting delayed was that the land earmarked for the project, located within GMC premises, was encroached upon. The project is to be constructed under the Prime Minister Swashtya Seva Yojna (PMSSY)-III. The project will be built on land admeasuring about 5,000 sqm. All existing super specialties operating in the government-run hospital will be moved to the new block. Plus, a few specialties including liver transplant facility will be introduced once the new facility is commissioned, a GMC official said.
 
 The space occupied by the existing super specialties would be freed up for other departments which are currently facing shortage of beds once the super specialty block becomes operational, said a GMC official. The GMC premises will also have a regional cancer center, another project of the central government.
