MUMBAI: Upping the   on its former ally on Saturday, the   targeted Shiv Sena chief   by circulating their caricatures on various groups. 

 The BJP and Shiv Sena trained all their guns against each other soon after Uddhav announced on Thursday his party's decision to contest the municipal corporation elections alone. 
 
 On Saturday, the BJP social media cell began circulating caricatures of Uddhav and Aaditya, who leads the Yuva Sena, mocking them and asking who is responsible for the scams committed under the pretext of distributing free tablets to school students. A representative of the cell said that they had the approval of senior party leaders to circulate such photographs and caricatures on social media.
 
 The Shiv Sena has ruled the BMC for more than two decades with support from its junior ally, the BJP. 
 
 The BJP social media cell is trying to corner the bow-and-arrow party online by circulating pictures that show the Mumbai's woes like the bad condition of roads, overflowing garbage and the water problem in slums.
