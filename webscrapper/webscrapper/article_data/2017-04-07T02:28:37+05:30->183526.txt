NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday called for chief minister  's resignation in the wake of the Shunglu panel report's findings. The party also trained its guns at the Centre and sought a CBI probe into the matter. 

  chief   said the allegations could broadly be divided into three parts: illegal land and office/residential space allotment on taxpayers' money, nepotism and sending people on "non-statutory foreign tours". 
 
 Congress will observe a 'black day' in all the 272 municipal wards on Friday. "Kejriwal has no ethical right to continue as chief minister," Maken said, adding: "This report should be made public. The Centre, home ministry and LG should order a CBI probe into the matter. If they don't do it, it would mean they are trying to protect Kejriwal." 
 
 Maken said the government "didn't follow any rules" in allocating a Type-V flat to AAP MLA  , a house to DCW chief   and office spaces to its MLAs. He also pointed to appointments of   (Kejriwal's relative) and Satyender Jain's daughter to key posts. 
 
 "Kejriwal is against DDCA and so are we. Like him, we have also levelled allegation against it. The main irregularity there is in the appointment of people at various posts. The issue is nepotism." 
 
 Maken, who has filed an RTI to get a copy of the report, said: "The allegations are very serious in nature. They have not followed the rules and took decisions that were not under their jurisdiction," said. Hitting out at AAP for appointing advisors at high salaries, he said, "They didn't have money to pay sanitation workers, but were paying consultants and advisors in lakhs."
