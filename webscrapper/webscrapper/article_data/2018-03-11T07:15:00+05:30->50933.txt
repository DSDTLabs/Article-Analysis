GREATER NOIDA: A man who allegedly shot dead his uncle and aunt during a panchayat session held in a Dadri village to resolve a years-old land dispute has surrendered in the district court after his wife was arrested for “criminal conspiracy”. 

 Around 10.30am on Tuesday, Vikram   had sprayed bullets at his uncle and aunt — Vedram (60) and Nattho (58) — in Chithera village when the meeting between Vikram, his second uncle Raje and third uncle Vedram remained inconclusive. Vedram’s son had in 2015 killed Vikram’s younger brother Gautam, which had embittered the enmity. Vedram's son Sandeep had lodged a complaint against Vikram and his cousins, Ankit and Mohit for killing his parents.
 
 Vikram’s wife Poonam and Gautam’s wife Usha had claimed they were not on the spot when the killings took place. Soon after the  , the police picked up the women “for questioning”. Poonam was subsequently booked for conspiracy under Section 120 (b) of IPC.
 
 Vikram surrendered before the CJM court on Friday, a police officer said.
