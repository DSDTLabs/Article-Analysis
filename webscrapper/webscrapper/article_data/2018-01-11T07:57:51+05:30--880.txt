 The CBI team also visited Sanvard village in Nagaur district where supporters of the slain gangster had gone on a rampage, vandalising public property and attacking cops on July 12. Apart from the violence, the CBI will also probe the mysterious death of one Surendra Singh, who was killed during protest.
 
 The CBI on January 5 had registered three FIRs in connection with the encounter of wanted gangster Anandpal Singh. The first FIR was registered in relation to encounter in Churu, the second FIR was registered to probe the violent protests that erupted in Sanvard. The third FIR mentioned the mysterious death of Surendra Singh.
 
 The CBI probe has also stirred the hornet’s nest with many Rajput outfits hinting at an alleged conspiracy by the government to clip their wings. Shree Rajput Karni Sena president Mahipal Singh Makrana claimed the state government departed from its agreed agenda and cajoled CBI to register a separate case against Rajput leaders.
 
 “As per the pact, the government had agreed for a CBI probe against cops who shot dead Anandpal Singh and Surendra Singh. We were taken aback when we found that a CBI probe has been ordered against us,” he said.
 
 Makrana himself has been made an accused by the CBI in one of the FIRs pertaining to rioting and unlawful assembly in Sanvarad in Nagaur.
