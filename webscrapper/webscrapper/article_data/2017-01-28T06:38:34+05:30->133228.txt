PUNE: Five policemen, including an officer, were pushed and abused when they tried to stop supporters of a criminal from ransacking the house of one his neighbours at Super Indiranagar in Bibvewadi on around 1am on Friday.

 The criminal,   (28), was hosting his birthday party when his neighbour,   alias  , wished him. “Bharat’s supporters were fuming after Balurangi shook hands with Bharat and walked out of the party. Minutes later, around 12 supporters of Bharat barged into the residence of Balurangi and thrashed him for shaking hands with Bharat,” said assistant inspector   of the Bibvewadi police station on Friday.
 
 He said, “The agitators abused Balurangi and pelted stones at him, his mother as well as his wife when they intervened in the dispute and tried to pacify them.”
 
 A five-member police team rushed to the spot. But the agitators picked up a dispute with the cops, too. They abused and pushed the policemen, preventing them from discharging their duty.
 
 Jagdale said, “We have arrested Bharat, a criminal on the record of Bibvewadi and Sahakarnagar police stations. He has 12 cases of body offence. He was produced before a magisterial court on Friday, which remanded him in police custody till January 30.”
 
 A complaint of rioting and obstructing police from performing duty under Section 353 of IPC has been registered against him.
 
 Bharat’s interrogation is essential to ascertain the names and addresses of his supporters for arresting them.
 
 As many as 34 cops have been attacked in different incidents from January 1, so far. Eleven cases have been registered in connection with these.

 “The policemen had behaved well, but still they were abused and pushed. Incidents of attacking or beating or roughing up policemen have been reported from various places recently, but I don’t think that there has been a spurt in such crimes”
