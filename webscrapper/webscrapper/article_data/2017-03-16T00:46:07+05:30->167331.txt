NEW DELHI: Vacancies in the higher echelons of the bureaucracy have reached “alarming levels”, with a shortfall of 1,470   officers as on January 1, 2016, a parliamentary panel has said, adding that such persistent shortage of officers in key positions at the Centre and in state governments affected governance.

 In a report presented in   on Wednesday, the parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law & justice said the shortage of IAS officers had been a perennial problem since 1951, but “now the vacancy position has increased to an alarming level” with only 4,926 incumbent officers against a sanctioned strength of 6,396 (77%) as per the civil list dated January 1, 2016.
 
 The panel strongly recommended that all efforts be made to fill up the vacancies, either by utilising the additional capacity at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration ( ) to train more IAS officers or increasing the training capacity.
 
 According to the report, the panel was informed of 1,470 officer vacancies in the IAS — about 900 vacancies from the direct recruitment quota and the rest from  . 
 
 The DoPT secretary had told the panel that the direct recruitment shortfall was primarily due to two reasons — cadre review was done very recently, increasing the number of posts, and for 10 years, recruitment has been abnormally low. He stated that direct recruitment could not be stepped up all of a sudden as the training capacity for IAS officers was only 180 per year.
 
 Moreover, if a large number of officers were inducted in one go, there would be problem of cadre management.
 
 The panel, however, noted that the LBSNAA director had informed it that the academy had the capacity to train more than 180 officers. The panel said it failed to understand why lack of training capacity had been cited as a reason for not addressing the vacancies.
