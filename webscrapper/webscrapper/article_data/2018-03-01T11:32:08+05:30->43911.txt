AHMEDABAD: Angered at being spurned by a 27-year old  ,  , 35, a resident of   — who owns a cellphone showroom — leaked her private pictures on several social media platforms. He also mailed some pictures to her relative. Shah apparently got her phone ID and password while repairing her phone and used the credentials to steal the pictures.

 Cyber cell officials of the city crime branch said Shah, who is married and has a child, developed a friendship with the banker. In time, he expressed his desire to have a relationship with her. “On being rejected, Shah first threatened to make her private pictures public,” a cyber cell official said. “Later, he seemed to have reconciled to the situation and promised not to leak the pictures. In the end, he did not keep his word.” According to cyber cell sources, the banker — who is single — had first visited Shah’s showroom in December 2016 to have her phone repaired.
 
 “Shah persuaded her to reveal her phone credentials. The two then became friends and met often,” the official said. “However, when she rejected Shah’s proposal, the friendship was frayed.” Shah went on the offensive and leaked her pictures through mail IDs that masked his identity. “The banker lodged a complaint against Shah. We then got the IP address of the device from which banker’s pictures were leaked,” said a senior cyber cell official. “We traced the device to Shah and picked him up. During interrogation, he confessed to his crime.”
