PUNE: Posing as a policeman, an unidentified man threatened to implicate a 55-year-old man in a drug-peddling case, and made off with a gold chain and cash in   on Wednesday night.
In a bizarre twist, the complainant -an office-bearer of a political party -claims he was hypnotized by the suspect. Police have registe red the offence under Sections 170 (personating a public servant) and 420 vant) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Eknath Kulkarni, the complainant, was waiting for a fellow party worker by the service road in   Pradhikaran around 7.30pm on the night of the incident when he noticed a stranger -riding a two-wheeler -gesturing towards him from the other side of a road. “Initially, I ignored him as I thought he may have been signalling someone else,“ he told TOI. The stranger went up to him, and asked him to follow him. “I don't know why I followed him,“ Kulkarni said.
 
 When they reached a secluded spot, the stranger told Kulkarni that he was a police officer, and alleged that Kulkarni was carrying heroin in his scooter. A shocked Kulkarni denied it, but the suspect, threatening action, asked Kulkarni to give him his wallet. “He took the cash in the wallet and my licen ce. He also to ok a gold cha in I wanted to get repaired from the wallet,“ Kulkarni said.
 
 Then, pretending to answer a phone call, the suspect disappeared after discarding Kulkarni's licence on the road. After trying to follow him in vain, Kulkarni filed a complaint at the Nigdi police station.
 
 Kulkarni said he spent an hour with the suspect. “I do not know how I followed his orders. He may have hypnotized me,“ Kulkarni claimed.
