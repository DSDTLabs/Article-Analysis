A 25-year-old resident of Dongripada in   range was on Monday arrested for allegedly   a forest fire and burning down close to 200 sq yards of green cover in Kavesar area. Forest officials said the accused, Rajesh Mokashi, had burt and cleared a part of the forest land for cultivation. However, he accidently ended up setting fire to a pile of dry leaves. This fire then spread rapidly. Mokashi panicked and fled from the scene. But the forest officials arrested him later. 

 “Mokashi lives on the outskirts of Yeoor range and was burning small grass and dry leaves to clear it up for cultivation. As the fire got out of hand, he immediately tried fleeing but our team which had seen the flames and gone to douse it saw him trying to escape. The officials quickly put off the fire. During interrogation, Mokashi confessed to the crime,” said Sanjay Waghmode, range forest officer (Yeoor).
