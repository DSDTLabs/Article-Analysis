Mumbai: The stock price of Anil Ambani-led   (RCom) crashed over 11% in Tuesday’s session on   and closed at Rs 17 due to a failed deal.   on Sunday said its proposed deal for a 50:50 merger with Aircel, another struggling telecom services company, was called off due to various reasons. 

 As a result of the crash in stock price of RCom, stocks of other group companies too slid and closed with losses. The shareholders across group companies were poorer by almost Rs 1,900 crore with the group’s total   now at Rs 50,200 crore, BSE data showed. Stock prices of Reliance Capital, Reliance Home Finance, Reliance Naval & Engineering, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure, all closed in the red. 
 
 Industry analysts remained bearish on the company’s stock. In a report,  , one of the most watched foreign broking houses in India, said that the calling off of the RCom and Aircel will hit the de-leveraging plans of the Anil Ambani-led company. 
 
 “RCom is still pursuing the tower sale deal to Brookfield but the valuation will be under review,” CLSA said. It also pointed out that RCom’s mobile operations continued to lose revenue market-share and there were high risks of further market share loss due to spectrum renewal risk. “With RCom’s immense operational challenges, high risk to our forecast and gearing out of control, we retain our sell recommendation,” the report said.
