RANCHI: Out of the 21 new industrial units in  ,  ,   which were kick-started on Thursday by   at a grand ceremony in Hotwar, one unit drew attention for its unique employment concept. MOUs for these projects were signed at the Momentum Jharkhand global investors' meet in February. 

 Aftab Alam, a small time apparel manufacturer from Ranchi, plans to hire differently-abled people from across Jharkhand for working at his upcoming apparel factory at Lohardaga.
 
 A bout of polio when he was just about four, had rendered his left arm dysfunctional. Having struggled with his disability, the 40-year-old entrepreneur now wants to turn the spotlight on others suffering like him by giving them employment and helping them live with dignity. 
 
 It was by sheer coincidence that Alam, a resident of Kantatoli in Ranchi, participated at the two-day Momentum Jharkhand summit. Three months later, chief minister Raghubar Das laid the foundation stone for his apparel factory over 14 cottas of land in Lohardaga. 
 
 "I can understand the difficulties and problems the differently-abled experience everyday in their lives. So when I thought of setting up the factory, I thought of them," said Alam on the sidelines of the ceremony. 
 
 Alam plans to hire 145 differently-abled people from Ranchi, Chatra, Simdega, Kolebira, Gumla and Pakur and train them for a few months before the factory becomes operational by the end of this year. He intends to open a training centre on the premises of the factory to impart skills in stitching and other aspects of apparel-making to his staff. 
 
 Alam had a lot of good words for the Raghubar Das government. "Officials in the industry department made me feel welcome. I did not have any difficulty and got the land with ease," he said. He now hopes to make his factory operational in the next six months.
