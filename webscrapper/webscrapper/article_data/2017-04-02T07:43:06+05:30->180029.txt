KHARGONE: Bollywood actor   pitched for   during the shooting of a film in Regwa village in Kasrawad here, nearly 250km from Bhopal. 

 Kumar urged the people to adopt   to ensure family hygiene in addition to the production of natural compost. He encouraged them to build toilets at home to eliminate open defecation. The villagers swore not to defecate in the open and make India clean. 
 
 Union minister   also addressed the gathering and said the use of twin pit toilets (designed by the government of India) at home will boost ' ', as well as manure for the farmers. Akshay Kumar, Tomar and team of senior officers of state and central government visited Radheshayam Patel's house at village 
 
 Regwa who built a twin-pit toilet model (which quickly converts fecal matter into manure, and is aimed at eliminating open defecation) under MGNREGA, and proceeded to empty the filled pit of the toilet built in year 2007.
 
 They went inside the pit and held up the compost (villagers call it 'Son Khad') found in the toilet in their hands to demonstrate that the exercise is perfectly safe. A twin-pit compost toilet is eco-friendly, technically appropriate, socio-culturally acceptable and economically affordable. It is an indigenous technology and the toilet can easily be constructed by local labour and materials. 
 
 There are two pits of varying size and capacity depending on the number of users. The capacity of each pit is normally designed for 3 year's usage. Both pits are used alternately. When one pit is full, the incoming excreta are diverted into the second pit. In about two years, the sludge is almost dry and pathogen free, thus safe for handling as manure.
