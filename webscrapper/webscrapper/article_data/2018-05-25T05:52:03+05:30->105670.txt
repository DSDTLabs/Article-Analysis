CHENNAI: A youth filming a   near   on Wednesday night was bitten on a toe by the reptile. However, his friend acted quickly sucking out the venom helping the youth but putting himself in danger. 

 The police said Boominathan, 20, of Mannivakkam and his friend Sadhiq, 27, from the same locality usually went to Mannivakkam lake for a chat after dinner. Boominathan is a butcher in the locality, while Sadhiq is employed at a private firm.
 
  
 
 Around 9pm on Wednesday, they found a snake near their usual spot. As there was no proper illumination, Boominathan switched on the torch on his mobile phone and decided to film the snake’s movement. According to the police, he kept following the snake which was trying to move away from them.
 
 Eventually the reptile bit Boominathan’s toe before slithering away. Hearing his friend cry out in pain, Sadhiq rushed to his side. He first made a tourniquet using a piece of cloth and tied it just above the bite marks on the leg. He then proceeded to suck the venom out.
 
 Soon after spitting the venom out, Sadhiq swooned. Boominathan, who had recovered a bit by then, cried out for help and a few other men who were seated nearby rushed to their aid. Both were immediately taken to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. They were given treatment and are said to be out of danger. They are yet to be discharged.
 
 Sadhiq told the police that he decided to suck the venom out based on what he had seen in movies. The Peerkankaranai police have registered a case and are investigating.
