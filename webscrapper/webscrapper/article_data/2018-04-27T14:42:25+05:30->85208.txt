PATNA: Muzaffarpur superintendent of railway police ( )   on Thursday ordered a probe into a Siwan GRP officer’s attempt to take the help of a tantrik, ‘Ghoda Baba’, to solve a case of theft.

 Singh told this reporter over the phone that Sonepur DSP (railway) Akhilesh Kumar would probe the matter. “Police are equipped with all the hi-tech technology to probe criminal cases,” he said and added the involvement of a tantrik for the purpose could not be justified.
 
 Reports said Siwan GRP station SHO Nand Kishore took the tantrik’s help to crack a case of theft in the house of Anil Kumar Srivastava of Railway Colony, Siwan. The tantrik visited Srivastava’s house on April 20 and conducted certain rituals. He again visited the house with GRP personnel on Wednesday afternoon and asked Srivastava to visit his ashram at nearby Mairwa at night.
 
 A furious Srivastava wrote to the SRP and sought his intervention to solve the case.
