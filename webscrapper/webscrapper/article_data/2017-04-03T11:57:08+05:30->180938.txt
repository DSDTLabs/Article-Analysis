BENGALURU: Uzbekistan's   skipper   felt that India had the upper hand as hosts of the   I, second round tie to be played at the   stadium over the weekend. However, the former pro felt his boys had it in them to challenge for a shot at entering the World Group playoffs.

 "India are strong opponents, one of the top teams in Asia. They are playing a home tie so they will have the advantage," said the captain. "But we know a lot of players. They have come many times to Uzbekistan to participate in tournaments, so it will be a tough tie," he said on the sidelines of the team's first practice session.
 
 The trio of 30-year-old Farrukh Dustov, 22-year-old world No. 379 Sanjar Fayziev and 18-year-old reserve player Jurabek Karimov sweated it out on Sunday, with their star player   expected later in the week, having stayed back in Tashkent to undergo tests on his foot. "We arrived last evening and this is our first day here. The conditions are a little different from Uzbekistan because of the altitude. As for the weather... it's 15 degrees in Tashkent now so it's a little hot. But we're okay," said Lebed.
 
 Lebed said he was confident Dustov would rise up to the challenge despite being out of action since last August. "He's getting fit and is in good shape. He's ready to play. That's why he's here. You could see in our last match against Korea that some of our young players are also ready. The young guy Fayziev has also won us points. So everybody here is ready," said Lebed.
