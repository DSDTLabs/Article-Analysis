 has completed 30 years in the industry and still feels there is much to learn. “For the past five years, I have been directing films and I feel I have just started my career — there's a long way to go. I still remember my first shot was with   for the series   directed by Amal Sarkar. For Indrani too it was her debut. And the shot was okayed at once. I was essaying the role of a driver and I learned driving 
  to be part of that  . So my journey began that day as a driver and the car is still running,” said Sil with a smile. We wish him success in this long journey!
