DEHRADUN: In the midst of 500-odd guests from across India and abroad, brides - Aaliya, Shraddha, and Kangana - were married to Bablu, Sonu and Nandu respectively, keeping true to the state's traditions in the remote Pantwari village near Nag Tibba in Uttarakhand's   on Sunday. 

 Amid lavish spread of local delectables, song and dance, these sprightly goats looked their resplendent best at the second edition of ' ' which progressive goat farmers from the area had put together to spread awareness on the necessity of breeding the right kind of animal.
 
  Tamara Gribble, a tourist from Australia, said, "The concept is simple but the message is significant. This will help reduce migration and more people will return to farming and rearing." 
 
 Experts present at the event said that the focus is to improve the gene pool of goats and sheep in the hills.
 
  Though there are around 1.15 lakh registered goat farmers in the state, according to the animal husbandry data, there is still a need to get the profession regulated. Evolution of a species doesn't happen if breeding is done wrong. Hence, the quality of milk and other byproducts goes down. 
 
  State animal husbandry minister, Rekha Arya, gave the event a miss. She had stood by the event when tourism minister   termed 'Bakri Swayamvar' an insult to Uttarakhandi culture.
