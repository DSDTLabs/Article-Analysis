NEW DELHI: The caretaker of Batla House when the infamous encounter had happened in 2008 was discharged in a cheating case on Tuesday.

 District and sessions judge   dropped charges against   who had let out the flat to the two terror suspects killed in the encounter.
 
 The flat owner, Mohsin Nissar, had accused Rehman of forging his signature in the lease deed while giving away the flat to the two suspects on rent.
 
 The court, however, said that the prosecution failed to show that the rent agreement was forged by Rehman.
 
 Rehman was arrested on September 21, 2008, for allegedly forging the rent agreement of L-18 flat in Batla House, Jamia Nagar.Earlier, his defence counsel   had argued that the police had failed to recover the original lease deed that was claimed to be forged.
 
 Khan had also argued that there was no question of forging any document since Nissar had himself handed over the keys of the flat to Rehman and asked him to let it out to a good tenant.
 
 The court order came on a revision plea filed by Rehman, challenging a magisterial court's order that had framed cheating charges against Rehman.
