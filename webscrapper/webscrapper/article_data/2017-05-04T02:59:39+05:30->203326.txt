NEW DELHI: East Delhi mayor Satya Sharma has complained that she has been deprived of entitlements such as official vehicles and   after the elections while her counterparts in north and south corporations continue to enjoy them. 

 “Violating rules, municipal authorities have told me that my tenure ended on April 30 and I can no longer use my office and official vehicle. I am still the mayor until the next mayor is administered oath,” Sharma told TOI. 
 
 Sharma refused to assign any motive to it, but said she had told the municipal secretary to consult with his counterparts in the other two corporations but he refused. “It may be due to his inexperience,” she said. 
 
 Sharma also said the east corporation commissioner Mohanjeet Singh is on leave and north commissioner P K Gupta has been holding charge in his absence. “I have spoken to Gupta about the treatment being meted out to me. I am also writing a letter to the LG,” she added.
 
 North’s mayor Sanjeev Nayyar supported Sharma. “We in north and south corporations are availing of all these facilities, and the law says we can do so until the new mayors take over.” 
 
 But some senior officials in the corporation argued that former mayors have to give up facilities after elections are held. Nevertheless, municipal secretary Sangeeta Bansal said the old mayors don’t remain signing authorities, they continue to hold their chairs and can use vehicles and offices. Her counterpart in east corporation, Madan Mohan, disagrees. 
 
 The debate perhaps is over ethics.
