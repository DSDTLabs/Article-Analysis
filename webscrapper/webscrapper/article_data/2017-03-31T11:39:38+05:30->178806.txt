At the product launch everyone is praising Ruhi. Ishita asks Adi about Ruhi and he tells her that she must be on her way. Adi introduces his business partner Vaibhav to Ishita.
 
  Mihika asks Ishita to get ready for her speech. Raman also sends her a message giving pointers for the speech. Mani comes with Aaliya. He tells Adi that he is proud of him.
  
  Ruhi is still at the office drinking wine and thinking how Adi has hurt her and she will prove her hard work today.
  
  
 
  
  Adi by chance looks at the invitation card and realizes Ruhi's name not on it. He calls the printer and scolds him. The printer tells him that only three cards got printed wrong and the rest have Ruhi's name.
  
  Ishita starts her speech and Ruhi enters drunk. Everyone gets shocked seeing her like that.
  
  She walks to the stage and starts complaining against Adi that how insecure he is with her. She says she made the launch happen and Adi just wants to be in the limelight.
