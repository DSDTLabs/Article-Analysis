NEW DELHI: Ahead of India’s three-Test series with Sri Lanka starting July 26 in Galle, we are recapping some match-winning performances by Indian cricketers in the Emerald Isle. Today, a look back at Virender Sehwag’s unbeaten double-century in   on the 2008 tour. 

 
  
 
 Galle International Stadium, where India had played one prior Test in 2001, which they lost by 10 wickets, were bowled out for less than 200 in both innings. India entered the second Test having been crushed at the SSC, where they conceded 600/6 to Sri Lanka and then responded with innings of 223 and 138 to lose by an innings and 239 runs. The new weapon was all-sorts spinner Ajantha Mendis, who combined with Muttiah Muralitharan to flummox the Indian batting line-up featuring Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman. 
 
 
 
 
 Anil Kumble won and chose to bat. Did India’s batsmen have an answer to Mendis and Murali? 
 
 
 
 
 After that spin-induced loss in Colombo, it was expected that India’s batsmen would again struggle in Galle, but what resulted was one of the most memorable fightbacks in modern day cricket. Leading from the front in showing that Mendis could be played, and attacked too, was Sehwag who sped to his half-century in 50 balls and reached three figures in 87. Gambhir made a patient 56 out of an opening stand of 167 in 31.5 overs, and India closed a rain-curtailed day on 214 in 44.3 overs with Sehwag going strong on 128 and Laxman on 13. 
 
 
  
 
 Once Laxman was extracted by Mendis for 39, the innings deteriorated but Sehwag proved impregnable, not out for an epic 201 out of a total of 329. (Mendis’ six wickets came at 4.17 an over). After an early wicket, Sri Lanka were carried by fifties to Malinda Warnapura and Kumar Sangakkara but the Indian spinners were beginning to get some purchase. At stumps, Sri Lanka were 215/5 with skipper Mahela Jayawardene four short of a fifty. 
 
 
 
 
 Led by Harbhajan Singh’s six wickets, India kept Sri Lanka to 292. Jayawardene fell for 86 - one of Kumble’s three victims - and India closed the lower order to secure a lead of 37. Sehwag again dominated with 50 off 52 balls while Gambhir grinded out 74 and Dravid 44, but two wickets just before the close of play left India at 200/4 with Ganguly and Laxman yet to get off the mark. 
 
 
 
 
 Mendis and Murali combined to bowl India out for 269, which meant that Sri Lanka had to chase a very tough target of 307. A crippling opening burst from Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan saw Sri Lanka slip to 10/3, which became 37/4 when Harbhajan dislodged the obdurate Michael Vandort. After recovering through Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sri Lanka unravelled in a stunning spell of hostile bowling from Ishant and crashed to 136 all out. The seres was levelled, and how.
