BATHINDA: Upset with the three-day old incident of attempt to steal Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at   village in Muktsar district,   Giani Gurbachan Singh on Thursday said police need to ascertain the motive behind it. He said as it has emerged that the woman who tried taking away the bir has links with Dera Sacha Sauda, the case needs to be investigated more thoroughly. 

 Hinting at a larger conspiracy, the jathedar demanded a case against the gurdwara granthi for negligence. He said when there are clear instructions that either the granthi remains present in gurdwara or depute a sewadar in his absence neither of them was present there when the woman tried stealing the bir.
 
 Former Dera Sacha Sauda follower Charan Dass and his sister-in-law Sapna Rani were caught on Sunday evening while trying to steal bir from the village gurdwara. The granthi caught them at the gate as the act was caught on   inside the sanctum sanctorm. Police had registered a case against the two following a complaint by the granthi.
