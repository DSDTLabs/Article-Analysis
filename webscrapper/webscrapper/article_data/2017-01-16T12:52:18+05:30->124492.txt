JALANDHAR/ LUDHIANA: Deputy chief minister (CM)   said on Sunday that Hindu Takht leader Amit Sharma was murdered because AAP and its national convener,  , were “instigating radicals to take on Akali Dal”.

 The SAD chief tagged the Delhi CM in a Tweet and said, “You are instigating radicals to take on AAP.” He followed it up with another post on the micro-blogging website: “Murder of Hindu org(anization) leader Amit Sharma is a result of this policy.”
 
 Though Badal junior tagged Kejriwal in the posts, he did not get a response. Earlier in the day, addressing a meeting in Atam Nagar constituency of Ludhiana, Sukhbir claimed that AAP and Kejriwal were disturbing peace and harmony in the state. “Kejriwal is hand in glove with radical elements like Babbar Khalsa. He is playing in to their hands. He is so desperate to grab power that he is even ready to compromise the state’s security and peace. He is the same man who has relations with fake jathedars who called a Sarbat Khalsa last year," Badal said. “I have come to know from reliable sources that Kejriwal and his associates met radical elements just a month ago. I appeal to Kejriwal to please refrain from disturbing the state’s cordial environment just for power.” 
 
 Badal went on to take on Capt  . “Every time there are elections, Amarinder says this is his last election. He has repeated this even this time and said he will take retirement from politics after these elections,” he said.
