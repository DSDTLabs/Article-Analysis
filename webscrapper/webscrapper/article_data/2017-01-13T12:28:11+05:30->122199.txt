AHMEDABAD: Union textile minister Smriti Irani on Thursday said that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on Prime Minister   were an attempt to save his “political inheritance” (i.e., his family’s rule). But she evaded a question about the impact of demonetization on the   of the country.

 Union textile minister was reacting to Rahul Gandhi’s remarks made at the national convention of the Congress where the latter had accused Modi of instilling fear among people and wrecking the country’s economy through note ban. 
 
 Irani was here on the last day of Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit-2017 to attend a seminar on ‘Trends and Innovation Impacting the Textile Value Chain’. She said that MoUs worth Rs 8,835 crore were signed by the textile industry of the state. 
 
 “Yesterday, Rahulji had made some statements against Prime Minister Narendrabhai Modi,” Irani said on Thursday. “However, Congress’s successive defeats in elections is an indication that people of India have shown faith in Modi's leadership.”
 
 In a sarcastic statement, she said that it is but natural that “Rahulji would be bit upset by Modi's growing popularity.”
 
 “His lowly remarks on the Prime Minister are a desperate attempt to save dynastic rule. I would only like to say that people's support and trust in Modi as expressed through votes is the biggest reply to Rahulji,” Irani said.
 
 
 
 aishadh Parikh, chairman of  , said on Thursday that the textile industry has been facing difficulties due to lack of ‘fibre neutrality’. What he meant was that the industry wants same tax treatment for all fibres. "Gujarat is no different from other Indian states in facing this except that we easily get power for the industry but have to pay more ," Parikh said.
