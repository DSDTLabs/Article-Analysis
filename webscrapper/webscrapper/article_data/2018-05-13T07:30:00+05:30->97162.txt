CHANDIGARH: Panjab University ( ) has changed the dates of the PU-common entrance test (CET) postgraduate (PG) to be held from June 2 and 3 to June 10 and 11.

 The deadline to submit applications is likely to be extended by a week. Details of the new schedule will be released on Monday. “We have rescheduled CET PG exam due to persistent requests from candidates appearing in other exams simultaneously. Now CET PG will be held on June 10 and 11,” said Parvinder Singh, controller of examinations, PU.
 
 He said there will be an extension of at least one week for the deadline since there was a civil services exam. This will give many candidates who had not applied another opportunity to apply for PU-CET (PG). He said PU would release the complete schedule on Monday.
 
 The university’s common entrance test for postgraduate courses was clashing with the Union Public Service Commission’s civil services (preliminary) examination, 2018, scheduled on June 3. “Earlier, there used to be no centre in  . However, this year, Ludhiana students approached us and told us that Ludhiana is also the centre. We had to take this into consideration,” said Singh.
 
 The university had rescheduled the exam of BCom students since it was clashing with a chartered accountancy test. Their exam was rescheduled to June 2, and the   entrance test was also falling on the same day. The LLM entrance test was also clashing with a judicial exam, all of this coupled together made PU change the date of its post-graduate entrance test.
 
 The university’s postgraduate entrance test is meant to get admission in various postgraduate courses on the campus and its affiliated colleges. These courses include LLM courses, Master’s in English, geography, disaster management and MS courses as well at university’s teaching departments and its affiliated colleges. Last year too, the entrance exam for post graduate courses was held on June 10 and 11.
