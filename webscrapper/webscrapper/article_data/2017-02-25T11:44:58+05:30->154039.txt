AURANGABAD: The Kranti Chowk police have launched a manhunt for an   aspirant hailing from   district after he allegedly tried to   a 21-year-old woman in a city-based lodge.

 As per the complaint lodged by the victim, the suspect took her to the lodge on the pretext of some work and forced himself on her. “The woman managed to call her mother for help, using the suspect’s cell phone. However, before she could tell her about her location, the accused snatched away the phone and disconnected the call. Her mother tried calling back on the number, but all her calls went unanswered,” said a policeman.
 
 He added, “The victim’s mother then informed her husband about the call and the duo then got in touch with the hostel authorities where the girl was staying. They also gave the mobile number of the accused to the hostel’s warden. After the accused started receiving calls from various numbers, he fled from the lodge. The incident took place on February 12. The parents did not want to lodge a police complaint fearing social stigma.”
 
 However, the parents decided to initiate legal action against the suspect after he along with his friends came to their home-town in a car. “The parents feared that the suspect might kidnap their daughter. Hence, they reached out to the city police chief on Thursday. We have registered a complaint and soon the accused will be nabbed,” said the officer.
 
 Investigation officer and assistant inspector Sunita Misal said, “Both, the suspect and victim are MPSC aspirants, pursuing their study in the city. Like other students, the suspect befriended the woman and taking advantage of the friendship took her to a lodge where he allegedly tried to rape her.”
 
 She added, “Teams have been fanned out to nab the suspect, who hails from   district and soon he would be rounded up.”
