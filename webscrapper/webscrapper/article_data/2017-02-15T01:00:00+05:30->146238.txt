For  , Valentine’s Day is not about roses and candlelight dinners. The actress, who’s happily single, spent the big day quite unconventionally. She shot for one of her films, and spent the evening watching three of her favourite romantic films, back-to-back.

 Payal says, “I’m not in a relationship, so spending the day with that special someone is out of question. Also, I’ve always avoided going out with my friends on V-Day because I don’t want to be the kebab mein haddi. When I turned 15, I’d made a resolution of sorts that I’d watch ' ' and 'Dil Toh Pagal Hai' on every Valentine’s Day till the time I’m single. After ' ' released, I’ve added that to my list as well. These films redefine love for me, and I think it’s the best way to celebrate the day.”
 
 Ask her what her idea of an ideal man is, and she says, “He has to be honest and educated. And most importantly, watch   movies with me.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the teaser poster of Payal’s upcoming film, ' ', which also stars   and Paresh Rawal, released recently. “The response has been encouraging. It will release this summer and will be a treat for the audience,” she signs off.
