Chandigarh: Without translations, it is difficult for a non-English writer to make his voice heard, which is a major problem, said acclaimed novelist and poet Vikram Seth, while speaking on the topic, ‘Thoughts of being a Writer’, at Panjab University here on Monday. This came in response to a question by interlocutor Prof Pushpinder Syal, who asked Seth whether he was satisfied with works translated from Indian languages or not. 

 Seth was in PU to deliver the 2nd Urmi Kessar Memorial Oration. Seth said although Italians thought translation was treason, it was as important an exercise as was writing. “Without translations, it would be difficult for a non-Anglophone writer to make his voice heard, which was a major problem,” he said. 
 
 Seth said he had been lucky to have a good Hindi translation of A Suitable Boy, of which the critic Harish Trivedi felt was as good as the original.
 
 When Prof Syal requested the acclaimed author to speak of his life with his parents, Seth said, “Life doesn’t cease to be a comedy because people die; nor does it cease to be a tragedy if people laugh.” 
 
 Seth’s mother, Justic Leila Seth, was the first woman judge of the Delhi high court and was known for being a member of the Verma Committee, which revolutionized rape laws in India, whereas his father was an executive. “Behind every successful man, there is a woman; but, I think, in my parents case, the reverse is true,” added Seth, while talking about his parents. 
 
 PU vice-cahncellor Prof A K Grover, along with dean (university instructions) Prof Meenakshi Malhotra, registrar Col GS Chadda , and senators and syndicate members of the varsity, attended the event at the jam-packed MS Randhawa Auditorium, PU.
