BHUBANESWAR: At a time when BJD and   (TMC) workers have started accusing   of using CBI to target their leaders in chit fund scam, senior BJP leader   on Friday questioned the impartiality and sincerity of the investigating agency. 

 Mohapatra said the CBI has no morality or sincerity at all. "The CBI had conducted raids on the houses of some people and also interrogated them three years ago. I don't know why it didn't arrest them then," he said. He said the CBI has again woken up after a long time. Delay in investigation gives an opportunity to   to destroy evidence. "If it starts the investigation process against the culprits after several months, how can it find evidence against them," he added.
