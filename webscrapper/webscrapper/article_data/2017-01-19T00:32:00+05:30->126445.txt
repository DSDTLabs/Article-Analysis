Bhopal: More than 100 notices have been served for cancellation of gun licences of the people who continue to defecate in open in the rural areas of Gwalior district. With the January 26 deadline approaching for making the region   free ( ), the district panchayat is cracking the whip.

 “You cannot justify act of a man who owns a palatial house with toilets, but still goes out for defecation or a man, who spent Rs 10 lakh in a wedding party, going out for defecation in farms,” said Neeraj Singh, CEO of district panchayat. With a gun slinging over arm, rich and influential people from rural belt of Gwalior region have been the most difficult lot to convince that open defecation is unhygienic. More than 80% of the people have constructed toilets at homes. “Majority of them are farmers and they threaten our staff when they venture for ODF campaign in the morning,” said Singh.
 
 Ravindra Singh, a farmer with more than 50 bighas of land and tractor, is a resident of Bhitarwar. Singh continues to defecate in open and also issues threat to the panchayat personnel involved in Swachch Bharat campaign, said Jay Singh Narwaria, project officer of the district panchayat. Jitendra Singh is another rich and influential farmer with a gun licence and old habit of open defecation. Both the villagers are now facing the threat of cancellation.”
 
 “The notice for cancellation of gun licence has come as a shock to them. Gun is their weak point, you touch their gun and they are ready to construct a toilet and use it,” said Neeraj Singh. “During our campaign to impose en masse fine in a village, we came across house of a man. It was a double-storeyed old kothi, but did not have a toilet. When the man learnt about the fine imposed on villagers, he started constructing a toilet before we could reach his house,” he said.
