Even as animal activists welcome the move to revamp the   park mini-zoo, one of the important factors that the   authorities have neglected is providing sufficient rest time to the animal and birds.

 The zoo is a place where people, especially students, start their study about animals as it is the only place whether they can see wild animals and reptiles in real time. However, just like human beings they too need rest, the activists said, adding that the authorities often refuse the acknowledge that.
 
 As per the norms of the   (CZA), the zoo should be closed by 5 pm as the movement of people would disturb the animalsâ€™ routine to a large extent, said Ni Jalaludin, president of Nature Conservative Society.
 
 The zoo authorities need to concentrate more on maintaining the animals and keeping the zoo campus clean, he said. Animals, especially monkeys, were found having skin allergies. Jalaludin said that more than three times the CZA had issued notice to close the zoo because of the space crunch. Many animals, including hyena, lion and tiger were moved to the Vandalur zoo in Chennai.
 
 Merging the zoo with the park would make space for more animals in the zoo and it would in a way be helpful for students and enthusiasts to know more about the animals, he said.  , another activist, said information about the animals, including their scientific name and unique habits, should be displayed.
 
 At present, the zoo has animals and birds, but no information about them was available, Salim said that visitors obtain no knowledge by visiting the zoo. It has become more of a leisure activity than an informative one.
 
 Also, the animals and birds should be kept along with their breeding pairs in habitats that resemble their natural ones the most. This not often followed.
 
 The area in the heart of the city has excellent green cover. The activists said that in name of renovation, the officials should not disturb the trees.
