 According to the complainant  , Dinesh Halpani had sold the land to himself by using different surnames. Dinesh used the surname Patel while posing as the seller and Halpani while posing as the buyer and chief promoter of Maa Umiya. There were many such cases.

 Wadhwani further stated that Halpanis had sold his land to Maa Umiya on paper even though they did not have its possession. He was stunned in 2013 when he received a phone call from district collector informing him that his land was required for an industrial estate. After going through papers obtained under RTI, Wadhwani realized that he was a victim of a massive fraud.
