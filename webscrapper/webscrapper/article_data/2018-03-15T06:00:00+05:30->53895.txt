Kolkata: The   created history on Tuesday by landing the C17 Globemaster – the largest aircraft in its fleet – at the advanced landing ground (ALG) in Tuting, Arunachal Pradesh. 

 Tuting, in Upper Siang district, is barely 30km from India’s border with China. Located at an elevation of 1,240m, the ALG at Tuting was restored in 2016 after remaining unused since the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict.
 
 The IAF uses ALGs in Tuting and other locations in Arunachal to keep forward Army posts along Line of Actual Control (LAC) supplied. After restoring ALGs, a decision was taken to allow commercial services in a bid to boost tourism and the overall economy of the region. 
 
 The Globemaster is 174ft long and has a tail height of 55.1ft. It is 169.8ft wide (wingtip to wingtip) and can carry a payload of over 74,000kg.
 
 The strategic landing at an ALG so close to the border is bound to make China sit up and take notice. 
 
 “The crew of the aircraft included Gr Cpt K Rama Rao, Wg Cdr Amiya Kant Patnaik, Wg Cdr K Trivedi and Sqn Ldr L Nayak. The challenging airfield is in the midst of high hills in a narrow valley. After completion of the trial landing, the C17 carried out an operational mission airlifting load into the austere airfield. The mission demonstrated the C17’s operational performance and IAF’s capability of tactical air mobility,” a senior officer said.
