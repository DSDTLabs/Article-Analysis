GANDHINAGAR:   chief minister   held a meeting with senior minister and bureaucrats to take stock of the water situation in the state and discussed ways to ensure drinking water availability. Gujarat is staring at a water crisis this summer, with low water levels in the   dam and almost all other major dams. At Saturday’s meeting, the government decided to allocate Rs 200 crore in special grants for augmentation of local water sources and instructed all collectors to form district committees, have weekly review meetings and start supply of water by tankers wherever required.

 Jagdish Prasad Gupta, principal secretary of the Narmada and water resources, water supply and Kalpsar department, said, “The CM had an extensive review of the water supply situation in rural and urban areas. He especially reviewed the situation in  , Kutch and  . We briefed him about the drinking water supply plan for all districts and regions. A local sources rejuvenation plan has been approved. The CM sanctioned Rs 200 crore as special allocation for the optimum use of local resources in peak summer. In Saurashtra, water is available in local dams, however, it needs some augmentation.”
 
 “All collectors have been instructed to hold weekly reviews of the water supply situation and coordinate with state-level authorities for micro and macro issues. District committees have been empowered to take immediate action like supply water using tankers etc.”
 
 “The state government has decided to stop the Narmada branch canal supply. Only the main canal will remain in use. An alternative plan for water supply discussed how the government can supply Narmada water directly from the main canal. The chief secretary will review the state-level situation every week. The government has planned according to peak demand last year. All collectors have been instructed to check water wastage and leakages and start awareness activities at local level,” he added.
