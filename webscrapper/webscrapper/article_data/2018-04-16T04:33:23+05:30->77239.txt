MUMBAI: The foot over-bridge ( ) on the south side of   station has been closed from April 12 to July 31 for replacement work. Commuters have been advised to use the other three FOBs-on the north, at the centre and on the south. 

 "The deck of the existing FOB had deteriorated and the reinforcement steel was corroded. It was repaired many times; further repairs were not possible," an official said.
 
 "It was more feasible to replace the FOB with a new one. Moreover, there are three other FOBs which are in good condition," said   chief spokesperson Ravinder Bhakar. He stated that the work has been planned in such a manner that there is least inconvenience to commuters. The fabrication of all the steel girders has already been completed.
