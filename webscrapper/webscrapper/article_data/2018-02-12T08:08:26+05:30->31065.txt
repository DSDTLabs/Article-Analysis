AHMEDABAD: The city   police has sought some road design interventions to reduce traffic jams and curb accidents. The note has been placed before the   ( ) for action.

 Among these recommendations is the creation of an alternative route to SG Road that can share the vehicular load. The traffic police feels that certain internal road networks should be widened and alternative access to or across the SG Road should be provided. The note mentions that most roundabouts constructed on the SP Ring road have now become difficult to manage and are prone to accidents.
 
  
  
 The traffic police note says that all mass transport should move in BRTS tracks rather than in mixed-traffic lanes. The traffic officials have pointed out that the   bridge network is “poorly designed” and that the odd structure may cause a hindrance to traffic flow.
 
 “We have sought more multi-modal integration points in the city which will integrate stations of metro, regional rail, buses, rickshaws, and taxis,” says a senior traffic wing official. “We have asked that these nodal stations be within 5-minute walking distance.”
