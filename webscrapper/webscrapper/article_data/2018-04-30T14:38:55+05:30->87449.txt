NAGPUR: Instead of depending on others to start cleanliness drive, people themselves should come forward to ensure that hygienic conditions are maintained around their homes so that diseases could be prevented, said Dr   at Raman Science Centre (RSC) auditorium on Saturday.

 Prize distribution function and a lecture on ‘Cleanliness, health and hygiene’ marked the culmination of Swachhata Pakhwada and Earth Day at RSC.
 
 Kamble said sant   was the pioneer of cleanliness drive in Maharashtra as he used to clean himself the areas he visited with a broom, the practice followed by the people. He also appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative on cleanliness.
 
 “Cleanliness could begin from home if less waste is generated. Today, everything comes with a packing which produces waste. Extra care is needed to avoid it,” he said.
 
 Kamble spoke on waste segregation and said, “Earlier, the waste material was used to be dumped at the same spot. Nowadays, wet, dry and medical waste is separated. However, it is not executed effectively.” 
 
 He listed the diseases caused due to lack of sanitation and asked students to bathe properly and not for the sake of it. He criticized spitting and open defecation, saying, “We do have a rich culture, but we are not cultured. We avoid untidiness in foreign countries, but do not follow the same in our country.” When will the citizens consider cleanliness as their duty, he asked.
 
 The cleanliness fortnight had commenced on April 16 and saw a variety of competitions such as essay writing, sit and draw and science quiz in which school students participated. A science lecture was also conducted on ‘Earth Day: Concerns of plastic pollution’, which was delivered by  , principal scientist, Neeri. 
 
 As part of the event, shramdan was carried out in which RSC staff members cleaned footpaths and roads around the centre.
