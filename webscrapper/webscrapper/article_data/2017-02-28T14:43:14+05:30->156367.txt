BILASPUR: A   attempt by three miscreants at a jewelry shop in Ghantaghar Chowk, Korba was averted on Sunday night due to a police patrol unit passing by during the attempt. 

 The robbers, who entered the shop posing as regular customers, brandished a gun all of a sudden at owner Vinod Sunaliya and forced him to fill a bag they had brought, with jewellery. There were just two employees present in the shop along with the owner at that time.
 
 After getting the bag filled, the robbers ran out of the shop, pursued by the owner who was crying for help. A police patrolling unit, which was incidentally, passing by at that point happened to notice the sequence of events and surrounded the robbers.
 
 As the robbers got distracted by the police, the owner was able to snatch back the bag from them. Soon after, the robbers opened fire at the police personnel, wounding an officer Manoj Pratap Singh. The three then managed to escape on a bike.
 
 Singh, who was shot in the hand, was immediately taken to the hospital and he is under treatment. He has been declared to be out of danger. Bilaspur IG   said, "Our patrolling unit tried their level best to stop the robbers". He also said that one of the three robbers had been arrested on Monday and that the bike that was used to escape had been seized.
