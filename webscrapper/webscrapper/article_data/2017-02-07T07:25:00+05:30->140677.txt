CHANDIGARH: Almost an year after the   Justice (JJ) Act came into force, the social welfare department has finally shifted the girl inmates of   to a separate children home, as required under the age and gender provisions laid down under the Act. Around 120 girls to a new home in Sector 15 named Ashiana.

 TOI had reported last year in June that social welfare department was yet to follow various provisions of the JJ Act including the age and gender provisions.
 
 A source from Snehalaya, requesting anonymity, said, “This was to be done for long as the JJ Act clearly states that children’s home should be separate for boys and girls and different for different age groups.”
 
 Under the JJ Act, children need to be kept in   based on age groups of up to 10 years, 10 to 15 years and 15 to 18 years. While the Act allows boys and girls of ages up to 10 years to share the home, but should have separate facilities for dining and bathing.
 
 Earlier, the girls and boys were sharing same campus in Snehalaya which was not even separated by a boundary wall and all boys girls from ages 1 to 18 years were living in the same hostel. The students were shifted on January 30 and 31. Nearly, 110 boys are left in Snehalaya after shifting the girls. 
 
 The JJ Act was implemented from January 15 and all registered children homes had to comply with the provisions till June-July last year.
 
 Though the move came after the case of child abuse was reported in Snehalaya last month, sources denied it to be the reaction to the incident. The girls, on the other side were happy to find a new home, sources said.
 
 Director of social welfare did not respond despite various attempts.
