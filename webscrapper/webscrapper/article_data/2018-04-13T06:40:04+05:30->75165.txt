BENGALURU: Lack of clarity in the approval form and miscommunication within BBMP’s forest cell has resulted a 30-year-old tree being axed in  . Miffed by the goof-up, several residents staged a protest on Thursday.

 While   officials claimed that permission had been granted to prune the branches, the field staffers working for the civic agency maintained the order was not clear and they were orally instructed to chop off the copper pod tree. It was located on 3rd Main in Ideal Homes Township in front of site that is reportedly owned by a person who works for an influential minister. 
 
 According to residents, this is the 23rd tree to have been cut in RR Nagar this year for trivial reasons. The residents, under the banner of Save Rajarajeshwari Environment Group, also lodged a complaint with police against the BBMP forest cell. 
 
 Vani Vaidyanath, president of Ideal Homes Residents Welfare Association, said: “When I was passing by the tree on Wednesday, I noticed a few branches had been cut and four or five men were standing around them. I instructed them not to proceed and went home. By the time I returned, the whole tree had been chopped off.” 
 
 Priti N, a banker who lives on the same road where the tree stood, said that the loss of greenery in RR Nagar is a major cause for concern.
 
 “We want to know how and why the tree was cut when the site owner allegedly sought permission only for trimming. We want this to come in writing from the site owner so that we can take action against BBMP, as this is a criminal offence. When we apply to the forest department for such work, the processing takes months. But in this case, everything happened overnight. We want to ensure that permission isn’t being given blindly,” she said.
 
 N Shanthakumar, assistant conservator of forests, BBMP, was unavailable for comments.
