LUCKNOW: The walls of their classrooms were leaking and the plaster peeling off. But there was no way that cash-strapped   and Crafts, Lucknow University, could fix them. Frustrated for being surrounded by peeling plaster and algae-ridden walls, sculpture students of the 106-year-old college have turned to their own skills and resources to revamp the rooms of their department. 

 Once their classes get over, students work on the walls. Filling cracks in the classroom wall, bachelors in visual arts students said they were putting in efforts to fix the damaged walls under the guidance of their sculpture department faculty before the new academic session.
 
 "This is called relief work and isn't it such a relief for our century-old classrooms which were waiting for repair and attention. We got the idea while we were learning relief work and chunks of plaster were peeling off the wall," said BVA IV year student Ravendra Yadav. Relief is a sculptural technique where sculpted elements remain attached to a background of the same material, giving the impression that the sculpture has been raised above the background.
 
  and   said they wanted freshers who join the college in the new session to get the feel of being in an arts college. "We want to complete the relief work before the new academic session begins. We work till late evening to beautify the rooms which have produced great artists over the years," said student Aman Chounkar.
