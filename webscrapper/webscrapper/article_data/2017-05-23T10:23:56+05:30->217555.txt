PUNE: The   association of   on Monday said it would join the day-long strike called by the   ( ) on May 30. The strike is in protest against the Union health ministry’s proposal to check and regulate sale of drugs across the counter and through internet with the help of an e-portal.

 “The AIOCD has called for the bandh in protest against the illegal sale of medicines through internet. All our members will participate in the bandh,” said office-bearers of the CAPD (chemists association of Pune district).
 
 Jagannath Shinde, president, AIOCD, said, “The proposal to set up an e-portal to regulate sale of medicines is completely impractical and poses danger to the livelihood of 8 lakh chemists in the country. Considering the insufficient IT infrastructure, it will be difficult for most of the stockists, druggists and chemists to upload the details of sales on the e-portal within a stipulated period.” 
 
 “In many of the villages, we do not have basic infrastructure like power. This will lead to shortage of medicines in the country,” he said.
