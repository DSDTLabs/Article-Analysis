NASHIK: Only three water tankers were registered with the Regional Transport Office ( ) in the financial year 2016-17 clearly stating that the water scarcity situation across the district is much better than the previous years.

 The vehicle population of Nashik district grew by seven per cent in 2016-17. By the end of March 31, 2017, the Nashik RTO has a registered population of 14,63,582 vehicles in its jurisdiction as against 13,65,292 vehicles in March 31, 2016.
 
 But going by the RTO records, the water tankers in Nashik grew from 802 in March 31, 2015 to 836 in March 31, 2016. However, by the end of March 31, 2017, the Nashik RTO had only 839 water tankers registered with it — only three new water tankers were added in Nashik from April 1, 206 to March 31, 2017.
 
 Senior officials of the RTO attributed the minimal rise in the number of tankers to the good rainfall Nashik region received last monsoon. The officials added that the rains were pretty good the last   compared to the previous year following which people may not have felt the need to purchase tankers for the water supplying business.
 
 Prakash  , district water supply officer, said, “Nashik district received good rainfall last year. In fact, the rainfall was 3 per cent more than the average annual rainfall of the district. However, during its previous year, the rainfall was 63 per cent of the annual average rainfall, following which water scarcity was felt in many parts of the district.”
 
 “Taking into account the water scarcity that struck Nashik two years ago, the district administration undertook various measures to ensure that people do not face water shortage. Meanwhile, many gram panchayats of the district also got works related to water storage done,” said Nandanware.
 
 “Compared to 2015-16, the water scarcity was not foreseen for 2016-17, following which people may have refrained from purchasing water tankers in large numbers,” he added.
 
 Nashik has seen two major water scarcities in the last few years, following which there are sufficient numbers of water tankers available. 
 
 “While people may be using the services of private   suppliers for functions like weddings, the district administration has pressed into service only 36 water tankers currently — mainly concentrating in Baglan, Yeola, Nandgaon and  ,” said the official.
