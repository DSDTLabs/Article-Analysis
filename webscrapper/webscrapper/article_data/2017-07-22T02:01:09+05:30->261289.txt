NEW DELHI: The Delhi government wants to start an alumni   the way private   do, to be able to help former students connect with the current students and inspire them to excel academically. Education minister Manish   has directed the Directorate of Education to draw up a detailed plan to institutionalise alumni associations, meets and events. 

 “It is important to inspire students to improve their academic performance. This can be done by alumni from the same school who have been successful academically and professionally,” said Sisodia.
 
 To this end, the DoE has been asked to create a website for former students of all government schools to register themselves. 
 
 An alumni of a Delhi government school will be able to register with his/her school through this portal. Even schools have been tasked with the responsibility of reaching out to former students and invite them for meets and interactions. Sisodia has asked for a plan to this end to be submitted to him by August 1.
 
 The government schools will also hold alumni meets to engage with former students. This move is in line with the government’s efforts to make its schools better than private ones in Delhi.
