NAVI MUMBAI: A   based ashram, run by   for Love ( ), is planning to serve at least one free meal for the   persons near Panvel railway station soon. 

 The initiative, scheduled to take off later this month, hopes to ensure that the poor and homeless get at least one hot meal in a day.
 
 “We have seen many homeless persons wasting away at railway stations or wandering in the local trains without any food. Providing them at least one free meal a day should make a significant difference to their lives. Many donors are willing to come forward and help us in this endeavour,” said the founder of SEAL, Pastor KM Philip.
