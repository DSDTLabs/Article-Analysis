Visakhapatnam:   work being taken up by the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) in collaboration with Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) is drawing the attention of visitors at  .

 K Mahipal Banerjee, a native of Kolkata who is in the city along with his family on a holiday, told TOI that he was particularly interested the ongoing dredging works along the shore.
 
 “I have to go inside the Vizag port to show the ships to my family. But here, due to the dredging, we are able to see large ships just by standing on the Beach Road. This apart, we are also technically aware of what is dredging and how it is useful for the sea and how it helps fight erosion,” Banerjee, a software employee, said.
 
 Another visitor P Manisha, who is from Hyderabad, said, “We come all the way to Vizag only to hang out at the beach. For the first time, I saw dredging works going on at the beach and I was fascinated to witness the sight.”
 
 VPT officials said dredging is part of beach nourishment works. A DCI dredger, which arrived from Haldia Port in West Bengal, is engaged in dredging activity. 
 
 An 800-metre long floating pipeline has been laid at the sea from the outer harbour of the port to RK Beach, besides the Kursura Submarine museum, opposite the TU-142 aircraft museum, officials said.
 
 “Dredging would be completed within the first week of March,” a VPT official said.
 
 VPT’s deputy chairman Haranadh said the port has been undertaking beach nourishment since 1979 when the outer harbour was built. “The port spends nearly Rs 10 crore for nourishment works annually. This year, nearly Rs 16 crore is being spent,” he said.
