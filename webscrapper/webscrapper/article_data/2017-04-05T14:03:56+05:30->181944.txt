PUNE:   parties in the state have questioned the BJP’s “dual policy” to waive loans of small and marginal   in Uttar Pradesh and reject the similar demand in  .

 Former chief ministers   amd Prithivraj Chavan, NCP leader Ajit Pawar and leader of opposition in state assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe- Patil came down heavily on the BJP government in the state for depriving the farmers of loan  .
 
 “ Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has been changing his stand on the issue (loan waiver). He has been saying that ‘appropriate time’ has to come to take a decision. What is appropriate time? The   government has already done it and now Fadnavis must act,” former chief minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan told TOI. He added that the opposition parties would continue to agitate for the   waiver to the state’s farmers.
 
 Former chief minister and state Congress president Ashok Chavan said, “The BJP has governments in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. But the party is discriminating against the farmers of Maharashtra. We will intensify our agitation for the loan waiver”. 
 
 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) state president Sunil Tatkare accused the BJP   of speaking and acting in different voices. “Here in Maharashtra, the chief minister is saying that loan waiver is not a solution to the farmers’ problems. At the same time, the loans of farmers in UP are being waived,” he said.
 
 NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar insisted that Fadnavis must not delay the decision on waving the loans and help the farmers to overcome the crisis.
 
 The UP government on Tuesday decided to waive Rs 30,729 crore loans of small and marginal farmers. The decision, taken at the cabinet meeting, will benefit 2.15 crore farmers in the north Indian state.
