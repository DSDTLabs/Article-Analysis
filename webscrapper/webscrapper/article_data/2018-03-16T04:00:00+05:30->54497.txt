Chennai: European childcare group Babilou, on Thursday acquired a majority stake in Amelio Early Education, a chain of early education centres, for an undisclosed sum. The Chennai-based company, currently having presence in Chennai and Bengaluru, is looking to expand in tier-1 cities. “This partnership helps validate our long-standing commitment to provide high-quality childcare to the Indian market. We will use the knowledge and scale of Babilou’s international experience to further expand the market and enhance our offering,” said Sridevi Raghavan, founder and CEO, Amelio. “We will also leverage the international partnerships Babilou has with companies and set up centres when those corporates set up shop in India,” she explained. Amelio currently operates 14 centres, with 220 employees and serves the needs of 1,200 parents.

 “At a time when India enjoys all the media attention in France with the visit of Emmanuel Macron, our presence in India illustrates the Indo-French entrepreneurial dynamism in this region of the world, in full growth,” said Rodolphe Carle, co-founder of Babilou Group.
 
 “For Babilou, this partnership is a new opportunity to transmit our “savoir-faire” while enriching us with new educational practices. We have been very impressed by the high-quality standards offered by Amelio’s programs and teams and our very excited about our plans for India,” Carle said
