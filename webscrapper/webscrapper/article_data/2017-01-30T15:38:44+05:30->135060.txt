 Iris Mittenaere, a 24-year-old dental surgery student was crowned the new Miss Universe in the annual pageant held in the Philippines. Iris belongs from a small town in the northern France. She defeated 85 beautiful women across the world and took the Miss Universe crown home. This year the pageant also changed its format—they got votes online from the Miss Universe app and Twitter and decided to have 13 finalists instead of 12.
 
  
 The winner Iris, was seen shining in glory in an all-sequin gold gown and during the final questions, Iris boldly discussed France’s open borders and refugees.
 
 “In France, we want to have the most globalisation that we can. We want to have the biggest exchange of people that we can. Maybe someday that will change but now we have open borders," she was quoted as saying.
 
 She will be seen promoting oral and dental care, as she has always been looking forward to using her crown to spread awareness about the same.
 
 On winning the crown, Iris declared:
  
 “I am very surprised I won, I feel blessed. Miss Universe was my dream, every girl wants to be the Miss Universe, the stage is amazing and everything is amazing.” She added, “I want to help people, I want to understand people, I want to meet people and that’s why this is a dream for me.”
