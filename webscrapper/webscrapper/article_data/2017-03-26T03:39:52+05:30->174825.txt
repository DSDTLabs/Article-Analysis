KOLKATA: More than 2000  , whose meat is often served in  , were rescued from the   area in Berhampore on Saturday. 

 A team of foresters from south range of Berhampore also arrested one   (30), a resident of Nishchintpur village in Murshidabad. CCF south east circle Kalyan Das said: "We are quizzing the accused for details. Meat of these birds are usually served in highway dhabas. Wildlife activists and NGO members alerted us."
 
 The birds, protected under Schedule IV of the wildlife protection act, feed on beetles and find dry rice fields as perfect hunting ground. They descend on the fields in large flocks post-harvest around March-end. Poachers place fine-mesh nets on the fields to hunt them. The birds are later untangled from the nets, put in baskets and sold in dhabas.
