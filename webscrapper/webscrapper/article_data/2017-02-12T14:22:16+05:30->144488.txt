THANJAVUR: DMDK leader   on Sunday said there is no need for   in   despite a power struggle in the ruling AIADMK. He said the turmoil in the ruling party has affected farmers who are waiting for crop loss compensation.

 At a time when faceoff between chief minister O Panneerselvam and AIADMK general secretary V K   continues, Vijayakanth has been meeting with his party workers in different parts of the state.
 
 Vijayakanth was in Thajavur district on Sunday after meeting party workers in Trichy and Perambalur districts in the last few days.
 
 He said farmers were at the receiving end of the power struggle in the ruling party. “As there is an unstable government in the state, the daily suicides of farmers across the state are being ignored,” he said. 
 
 “Farmers are waiting for compensation for crop loss. But no leaders are ready to speak about it,” he said.
 
 Vijayakanth refused to comment on the feud in the AIADMK. “I would rather prefer speaking about public welfare,” he said.
 
 “There no need to impose President’s rule in the state,” he said while replying to a question by reporters.
 
 Asked about AIDMK legislators joining the   camp, he said, “Ikkaraiku akkarai pachai (the other bank of the river looks greener).”
 
 Meanwhile, Premalatha said in Chennai that it was not good for the state to have a temporary CM for a long time. “There is no point in blaming Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao when ruling AIADMK members are fighting to capture power. It may take time for the Governor to take a decision. We hope that he would take a good decision considering the welfare of the people in the state,” she said.
