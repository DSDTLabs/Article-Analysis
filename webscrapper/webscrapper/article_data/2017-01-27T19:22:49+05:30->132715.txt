BHUBANESWAR:   (NSUI) and   on Friday alleged the CBI was showing leniency towards  , who is in an eye of storm for his alleged connection in Seashore Group chit fund scam. 

 The NSUI and Youth Congress leaders staged demonstration outside the CBI office and allegedly clashed with the police officers when the latter prevented the protesters from barging inside the probe agency’s office. “We demand immediate arrest of Jena. CBI had questioned him in January 2015 and raided his houses in Balasore and Delhi on January 12 this year. This shows the CBI’s soft corner towards the BJD leader as he must have destroyed evidences in the past two years,” said NSUI’s state president Itish Pradhan.
 
 The protesters alleged CBI allowed Jena to file anticipatory bail in Orissa high court. “It seems the CBI is allowing Jena to get anticipatory bail. Why is the CBI waiting? Is it difficult for the CBI to trace Jena? Why is the probe agency not declaring Jena a proclaimed offender,” asked state Youth Congress state president Lokanath Maharathi. Maharathi alleged BJD signed a secret pact with BJP to hush up the CBI probe into mega chit fund scam in the state. 
 
 CBI officials denied the charges. “We will oppose Jena’s bail when the matter will be heard by the judge. CBI never shows leniency to anyone,” said a CBI officer. BJD said the Congress wings raised non-issues. “Congress showed signs of frustration by raising non-issues,” BJD spokesperson Suryanarayan Patro said.
 
 Jena’s role in Seashore scam came under scanner following his dubious business deals with the firm. CBI sources said Jena had taken a loan of around Rs 18 crore from Seashore Group’s chief Prashant Dash in 2011-12. The probe agency alleged Jena did not repay the entire money, which amounted to conspiracy and embezzlement of public deposits. Jena already denied the charges against him.
