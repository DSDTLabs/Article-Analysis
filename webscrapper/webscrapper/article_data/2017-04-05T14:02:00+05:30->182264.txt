CHANDIGARH: Women MLAs of the ruling BJP have demanded a fair representation in the Haryana cabinet from chief minister  . Claims of women legislators have gained momentum at a time when insiders in the BJP are hinting at a major ministerial reshuffle even as Khattar and his team have denied any such move.

 The six women MLAs demanding representation in the cabinet are among the 18 dissenting legislators who have accused the government of not paying heed to their grievances. Their demand got louder after senior leaders of BJP, MLAs and CM Khattar met the party high command including president   and Haryana affairs in-charge Anil Jain.
 
 “We agree that the induction of cabinet colleagues is the prerogative of the CM. But we have worked with different CMs and they too have had respectable number of women ministers as their colleagues. I shared the cabinet berth with Prassani Devi and Shanti Rathi during the tenure of Bhajan Lal. Similarly, the   government too had three women as ministers and two as chief parliamentary secretaries (CPSs). We have just one woman minister and a CPS now,” said Santosh Sarwan, MLA from Barara.
 
 Kalka MLA Latika Sharma, vice-president of BJP’s women wing, said, “Women need to be elevated in Haryana as well. We are disciplined workers of the party and part of the government,” she said.
 
 The CM has one woman minister Kavita Jain in his cabinet and   as the CPS.
 
 Speaking to TOI, BJP’s Haryana in-charge Jain ruled out any reshuffle in Haryana. “Leaders are being called for various plans. We don’t see any plans of new appointments in Haryana in the near future,” said Jain.
