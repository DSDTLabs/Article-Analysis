Mohali: Flight operators Air India, Vistara and   services from Delhi have been grounded for 7 days while Go Air flight from Mumbai has been halted for a day at Chandigarh International Airport from January 18 to 26. As many as two other   from Delhi have also been rescheduled.

 The CHIAL spokesperson said that due to a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), the airspace over Delhi remains closed for 105 minutes daily during the aforementioned nine days in the run-up to January 26 owing to heightened security preceding the Republic Day flypast. Most of the flights scheduled to operate to and from the airport during the airspace closure hours are rescheduled. As a result, the flights departing from Delhi remain grounded. A flight from Mumbai has also been cancelled for January 26.
 
 What is NOTAM?
 
 A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is a notice filed with aviation authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along the flight route or region that could affect the safety of flight.
 
 With the release of closure of air routes over Delhi airspace, the flight operators claim that they are likely to lose   of more than 100 seats daily which will likely amount to Rs 3.6 lakh.
 
 R K Negi, Air India airport manager said, “The Delhi flight gets more than 100 bookings daily. The Air Bus A-320 economy class ticket is priced at Rs 3,600 which has capacity of 150 passengers. We are informing the passengers who have already got the bookings through call centers, SMSes and email to get their refund. We are likely to lose revenue worth Rs 3.6 lakh per flight,” said Negi.
 
 He further added that the total loss upto January 26 will culminate to total loss of Rs 25 lakh.
 
 Similarly, Jet Airways airport manager Barinder said, “We have an ATR aircraft with passenger capacity of 72. Each seat carries a minimum price tag of Rs 3,600 from Chandigarh. This computes to a loss of Rs 2.5 lakh per flight and during the total closure it may rise as high as Rs 18 lakh.”
