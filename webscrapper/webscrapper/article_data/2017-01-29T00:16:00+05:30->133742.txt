Davanagere: “We want to make JD(S) a strong regional party in line with those in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states,” said former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda in Davanagere on Saturday. 

 Speaking to reporters while campaigning for Ramesh Babu, the party candidate for the South East Teachers’ constituency, Gowda appealed to the teachers to caste their first preferential vote to Ramesh Babu.
 
 When asked about the decision of the seven suspended JD(S) MLAs to join Congress, Gowda said that joining   is left to their choice and he had nothing to say on the matter. “We have suspended them for their anti-party activities but their primary membership is still with the JD(S),’’ he said adding that some of them have said they would contest elections against Kumaraswamy but he had no time to bother about such things.
 
 To a question, Gowda said that further action will be taken against   after the party’s disciplinary committee submits its report.
 
 MLC TA Sharavana, local JDS leaders Dasakariyappa, Kalle Rudresh were present. Earlier, Gowda addressed teachers at Harihar.
