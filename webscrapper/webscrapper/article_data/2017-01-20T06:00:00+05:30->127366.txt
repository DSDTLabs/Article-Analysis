KOLKATA: The men in blue and women in various shades of grey made a comeback to 5 lakh homes with   returning to   on Thursday after a 13-day blackout. 

 Sources said the MSO and broadcaster had thrashed out a deal that included part payment of dues upfront and a deferred payment of the rest.
 
 The 33 Star channels, including Bengali and Hindi entertainment as well as four sports channels, resumed service on Manthan around 12.45pm on Thursday, just before the 2nd India-England ODI. Manthan viewers had tuned to Doordarshan to watch the 1st ODI. But it is the return of Bengali and Hindi soaps, with women in diverse lead roles, which have a large viewership among home-makers and domestic help, that came as a relief for   operators aligned to Manthan. Pressure from subscribers had even forced some operators to resort to signal piracy from operators aligned to other MSOs.
 
 Sudip Ghosh of Manthan claimed the negotiations were amicably concluded late on Wednesday but the signal could not be restored before Thursday afternoon owing to technical issues. While industry sources said Manthan had paid a third of the dues running into several crores, Ghosh declined to divulge the commercial deal.
 
 The signal to Manthan had been snapped by   after a series of cheques were dishonoured by the bank. 
 
 Ghosh admitted Manthan had financial constraints in December owing to deferment in the rollout of the third phase of cable digitization and poor subscription collection due to demonetisation. Also, 80% subscribers did not pay the hiked fee Manthan had announced in October. “Operators had run up a huge outstanding and that had affected our payment,” he said.
 
 Manthan isn’t the only MSO that has had trouble with the broadcaster, leading to channels going on the blink. In the recent past, GTPL has had problems with Zee and Sony, while Hathway got into a row with ESPN, Star and Zee.
