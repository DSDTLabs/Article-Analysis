HYDERABAD:  , a brain-damaging virus, killed at least 11 people in  , but health experts and chiropterologists differ on the role of bats in spreading of the  . India’s prominent bat biologist, Dr   of  , said fruit bat is a host to Nipah virus, but role of fruit bats in the spread of disease has been exaggerated.

 
 
  
 
 Dr Srinivasulu told 
 : “Usually, most of the zoonotic diseases are transmitted by a bite by animals to the first person who gets infected. There is a lot of negative propaganda stating that bats are responsible for Nipah virus deaths. Unless scientifically proven as to how the first infection happened, it is premature to conclude that it is being spread by fruit bats. During Ebola outbreak, bats were blamed but later it was found that chimpanzees and gorillas which got infected played a role. The video collected from a Kerala well, a habitat of bats, shows that it is not the large fruit bat (Pteropus giganteus). It looks like a small bat.”
 
 He added, “Several tribals eat bats all over India. But there are no instances of them getting infected with the deadly disease. Due to loss of habitat and stress factors on environment, bats are losing immunity because of which the virus is jumping out of the host. Instead of creating panic, issues about their conservation and avoiding conflict with humans should be addressed. In Hyderabad, there are six to seven colonies of fruit bats close to human habitations.”
