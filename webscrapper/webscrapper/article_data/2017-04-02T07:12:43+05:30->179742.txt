CHENNAI: Chennai police commissioner   may be new to his office but he wants to address old problems.

 Singha said he wants to meet common people and hear their grievances at least twice a day. At present, he is meeting people once a day. To feel the pulse of the city and its people, the commissioner travels in his car through the congested city roads. Singha has instructed his subordinates to ensure vehicles parked on the road are removed and ensure a smoother flow of traffic. “As I have a very limited time, I am focusing more on the preparations for the R K Nagar byelection,” said Singha.
 
 “I am available at the   hall on the ground floor to listen to people and their petitions. If there are a few petitioners, I call them to the conference hall next to my office and meet them personally,” Singha said, adding that he has reduced his sleeping hours to focus more on the people.
 
 On the city’s traffic, Singha said, “The vehicles parked on the road eat up most of the road width. This slows down vehicular movement.” Singha has planned to meet traffic police officers in the city and find a solution to road congestion.
 
 But for now, he is focussed on the R K Nagar bypoll. “City police have taken action against people attempting to bribe voters in the constituency. I will ensure for a peaceful byelection,” he said. For this, Singha said he depend on the services of the existing cadre of senior officers ranging from rank of   to that of the DCP.
