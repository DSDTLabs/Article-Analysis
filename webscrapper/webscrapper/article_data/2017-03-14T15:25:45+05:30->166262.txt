 this year seems to have taken on a brighter colour, all thanks to the prospect of the return of   after a gap of two years. Rahaad has been an integral part of Nashik’s colourful Rangpanchami celebration for past 350 years. However, due to severe water scarcity last year, the organisers, along with youngsters, decided to call off the celebrations. The sufficient rainfall in 2016 has ensured goof amount of water reserve for this summer, putting celebrations back on track.

 “Rahaad has always been part of Nashik’s culture. There is hardly a soul who hasn’t taken a dip in this water tank on Rangpanchami. Dancing on the beats of dhol-tasha and taking a dip in Rahaad marks the festival for Nashikites. This year, the preparations are on. I am sure Nashikites will be really excited to dunk in colourful water after a gap of two years,” informs Shahu Khaire, a local corporator in old   area where two main Rahaads are situated.
 
 “Rangpanchami is synonymous to a dubki in Rahaad for us Nashikites. Last year, due to the water scarcity we could only afford to enjoy a dry  . However, this year we are planning to enjoy the festival to the fullest, and that means a dubki in Rahaad,” expresses  , a third year engineering student of Guru Govind Singh College. 
 
 “A rain in March! Who can’t resist that? Rain dance events are the second best thing that Rangpanchami in Nashik can offer. I have also seen a few girls at such events. Unlike Rahaad, where only boys jump in the coloured water tank and celebrate Rangpanchami, girls can have fun at these rain dance events,” Chetan Deshmukh, a third year student of KK Wagh College adds. 
 
 “There is live music, where you can dance on the beats of Nashik dhol. The whole atmosphere is thrilling. It’s the best way to have fun with friends and feel some relief from some of the exam pressure,”  , a third year diploma student expresses enthusiastically.
