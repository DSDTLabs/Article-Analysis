PATTRAN (PATIALA): Life seemed to be smiling on the young woman sarpanch from Patiala’s Haryou Khurd village  , when   gave her a ticket on November 13 to contest the Punjab assembly election from Shutrana constituency. The 39-year-old Dalit was up against Shiromani Akali Dal’s sitting MLA Varinder Kaur Loomba and she was ready for the fight.

 Fifteen days later tragedy struck. Deadly dengue claimed her husband. The grief should have dampened her campaign. Instead, it only strengthened the feisty woman’s resolve. Fresh from AAP chief  's back-to-back addresses in her constituency, Kaur has started canvassing.
 
 She insists her Dalit identity and gender are her biggest assets. "In 2014, nearly 10,000 villagers had boycotted   and SAD and I was elected sarpanch of my village,” she says. “I have a car now but then I would ride a two-wheeler to campaign. I am glad Arvind ji came here and saw the anger in people.”
 
 Not surprisingly, improving basic health infrastructure in the region is top on her agenda. She wants more hospitals, better implementation of health programmes and more sewage corrections. The bane of Shutrana is the widely-reported flood fury of Ghaggar river from neighbouring Haryana. The river wreaks havoc for nearly three months. Over-flooding damages the paddy crop and leads to water-borne diseases.
 
 "Our area lacks decent hospitals. The only people who get treated in the existing hospitals are goons who get injured in the fights. The area shares a border with Haryana and we have been ignored for years.”
 
 The combative spirit in the family is not new, she says. "After I became sarpanch, SAD government dismissed my husband who worked as patwari (revenue officer). He took the matter to court and fought his case and was reinstated six months later in January 2016."
