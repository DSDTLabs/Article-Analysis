Aurangabad: Returning to its non-transparent stand, the top authorities at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) tried to convene a closed-door meeting of the senate and keep the media out on Tuesday.  While banning media from attending senate proceedings has been the norm at Bamu until the practice was abolished two years ago, vice-chancellor B A Chopade and others again denied entry to media persons during the presentation of the university budget for 2018-19.  Media persons, who were initially asked to leave the venue of the senate meeting, were later allowed to sit inside after several senate members prevailed upon the VC and his team to reconsider their decision.  Several stakeholders accused the VC as well as the BAMU administration for keeping the senate meeting a secret affair in order to save their skin. Student activist Tukaram Saraf of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena said it is a regressive move on the part of Bamu authorities to ban media from the senate proceedings.  Addressing the senate, Chopade tried to pacify the protesting members by saying that he has no qualms about media persons being allowed for the senate meeting.
