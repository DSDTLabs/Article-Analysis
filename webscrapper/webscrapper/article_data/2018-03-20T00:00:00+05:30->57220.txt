Will they, won’t they? There has been speculation galore regarding Sandalwood couple   and  , who have been together since they shot for  , their first film together in 2009. On a recent appearance for a TV chat show hosted by Shivarajkumar, Diganth hinted that marriage could soon be on the cards for him. 
According to sources, Diganth said that there could be a wedding this year end. When we contacted both   and Diganth, the couple didn’t deny the fact that marriage is on the horizon. Both, however, tried to evade discussing a date. “Let’s wait for a proposal first,” joked Aindrita, while Diganth laughed, “I said I was getting married, but didn’t mention to whom.” Playfulness aside, let’s wait and see when these lovebirds decide to make their formal announcement.
