CHANDIGARH: If given approval by the syndicate in its upcoming meeting on February 24, the income or funds of students or societies in   (PU) departments more than Rs 2 lakh will be audited from CAG empanelled chartered accountancy firms based out of the Tricity.

 Earlier, the provision was that if the income/receipt of these student funds or societies was more than Rs 2 lakh, they would get audited by an independent chartered accountant out of the panel approved by the university.
 
 “The PU panel had CAs who used to audit the hostel accounts but now the hostel account is with us and comes under resident audit. Now, we don’t have that CA panel since PU used to specifically appoint CAs to audit the hostel accounts. Now, we have proposed that instead of getting the audit done by CA panel approved by PU, get it audited by the CAG empanelled CA firms,” said  , finance development officer, PU.
 
 Recently, Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) secretary Vani   had raised the issue of student funds given to   (UIET). The council secretary had raised questions on the spending of this money, which she had claimed comes out to be around Rs 22 lakh.
 
 “In the departments, there is no proper policy as to how this money of the students and for the students should be utilized. The internal audit committees also have student representation but they are also clueless to distinguish where the money should be spent. If the audit is done by CAG empanelled CA firms, there will be better utilisation of students’ money meant for students,” said Sood.
 
 According to the existing provision, for each financial year, the accounts of students fund/society are audited by an internal department audit committee which consists of one student representative besides two faculty members. The annual report of account shall be submitted by the department to the registrar within 60 days of closing to financial year.
