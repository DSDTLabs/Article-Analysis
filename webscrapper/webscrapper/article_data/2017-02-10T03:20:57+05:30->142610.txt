GURUGRAM: The   branch that was robbed on Thursday is on a busy road and located on the first floor of a commercial building but as the   was being pulled off at high noon, no one around seemed to have any idea. It took them exactly 18 minutes to finish the job — fill three bags with   worth around Rs 9 crore and Rs 7.8 lakh in cash. 

 The robbers, seven or eight in number, stayed in the finance company’s office for 23 minutes, attacked two guards and held three customers and four officials hostage and went about their business with clinical efficiency. 
 
 Ishwar Singh (64), who had walked into the branch in the middle of the heist, said nothing outside had aroused suspicion. Singh was greeted with a gun pointed at him when he stepped in and asked to sit quietly as the robbers went about their business. When they left, everyone was asked to stand against the strongroom wall and the grille gates locked.
 
 “When they ordered me to sit with others and pushed me inside the strongroom, I thought we will all be killed. They packed the gold in bags and walked out easily,” Singh said. 
 
  
  
 
 People outside the finance office said they got to know what had happened only when police arrived. A shopkeeper, Ranjit Singh, said they did not suspect anyone because everything seemed to be routine. The gang had not entered together but in batches to remain innocuous. 
 
 Raju, who works at a salon located just adjoining the bank building, said he had not found anything amiss before the police arrived. “We have formed five special teams and are conducting raids,” said Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime), Gurgaon.
 
 Rinku, an employee at the Manappuram office, was attacked with a knife when she tried to flee. The guard, Devi Charan, was thrashed, his rifle snatched thrown on the terrace.
