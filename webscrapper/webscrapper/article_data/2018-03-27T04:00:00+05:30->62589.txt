Rajkot: Victims of Una flogging and other Dalit community members will launch Samvidhan Gaurav Yatra (March to uphold pride of Constitution) from the coastal town to Gandhinagar on March 28.  The march is being organized to give out a message that Dalits must get their rights according to the Constitution.  The family of Balu Sarvaiya, father of Una flogging victims and that of Lalu Sarvaiya whose house was set ablaze along with farmers from several villages of Una taluka who are fighting for land rights will participate in the march that will culminate in the state capital on April 3. Advocate Sanjay Sondarva, who will lead this march, said, “In Motha village of Una taluka, Baudh Vihar was demolished two years ago. This was the centre of faith for many Dalit families. Here, Dalits don’t have the right to enter the temple and are considered untouchables. We are organizing this march to appeal to the government and administration to follow our great Constitution.” The march will also highlight the struggle of the Constitution committee’s leaders. Keval Rathod, a Dalit activist, said, “The aim of this march is to make people aware about their constitutional rights and duties.”  The march will begin from Dr Ambedkar Square in Una and reach Gandhinagar via Khambha, Amreli, Dhasa, Botad, Surendrangar, Lilapur, Viramgam, Sanand and Ahmedabad. Nearly 50 people from Una are expected to join the march.
