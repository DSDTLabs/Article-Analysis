 “Today school and college going students hack computers for fun. But most of them have no clue about cyber law. This is very unfortunate. In fact, the youth should know about the laws related to technology just like the way people know that need to stop at a traffic signal when the light turns red. It is sad that children/youth are not even familiar with the types of cyber crime and who they should approach when they become victims of such crimes,” said Tandon.
 
 Reiterating the rise in social media-related offences, he said that the most   committed by the youth include hacking and floating of fake virtual profiles. “Will anyone talk to a stranger on the road? No. But on Facebook, nowadays, college and school students have over 300 friends. After talking to people for few days, they start sharing their personal pictures and details. There have been several cases across the country, where girls have become victims of fake profiles,  , sexting and hacking,” said Tandon.
