 That often, the   is unable to reach the spot of   is a common truth. Now, to ensure there is some damage control in the initial moments of a fire, students of an engineering college have come up with a device that can help those stranded. The team of students comprising Digvijay Kumar, a second-year student from   from Anekal, and his four classmates showed BM their innovation - a   that can douse fire and prevent any place from becoming an inferno.
 
 The students have developed a drone that carries a ‘fire ball’, a ball that can be dropped on the fire accident spot and explodes in an effort to douse the flames. The drone that can travel up to 40 kmph, has a camera that lets the user monitor the situation as well. The ball consists of sodium bi-carbonate and will turn into carbon dioxide upon explosion to suck out whatever oxygen there is in the atmosphere so the flames do not spread (oxygen is a major catalyst for fire).
 
 The drone comes with a 4000 mah battery that can last for at least five hours. The team spent about Rs 40,000 on the project and six months to develop the product. The students have also planned to approach the Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Department to hand over the innovation. “Our main intention is to help both the department and the public in such fire accidents. In many cases, due to traffic or congested roads, the rescue team may not be able to reach the venue quickly. But this drone will reach much faster and work on saving lives,” said Nandini B, another second-year student of the college.
