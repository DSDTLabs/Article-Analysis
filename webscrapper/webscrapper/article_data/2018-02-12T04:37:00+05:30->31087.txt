MUMBAI: Dream to make it big in Bollywood, craze to meet their favourite film stars, scolding by parents or a wish to see the ‘maximum city’ are some of the reasons that prompted over 700 children to run away from their homes and come to Mumbai last year. 

 As per the figures provided by the RPF, 706 children, mostly from other states, were rescued from various railway platforms of Mumbai and its suburbs in 2017. 
 
 “Altogether 528 children (360 boys and 168 girls) were rescued from western suburbs, while 178 (115 boys, 63 girls) were found in the central suburbs. 
 
 Most of these children were in the age groups of 13-18 years and hailed from states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat,” an official said. 
 
 Among all the stations in Mumbai and suburban areas, Mumbai Central accounted for maximum number of rescued children (129). 
 
 “Mumbai Central tation is home to about 21-22 long-distance trains from states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Last year, we rescued 129 kids from here and most of them hailed from these states,” said Anup Kumar Shukla, senior divisional security commissioner,  , RPF.
