PUNE: A sessions   here is likely to hear on Saturday the   application of the accused arrested for the murder of   software engineer   O P at the Hinjewadi campus in December last year. 

 Bhabhen Bharali Saikia (27), a security guard with the IT company, allegedly strangulated Rasila (24) to death in a fit of rage after she had reprimanded him for staring at her. His lawyer Biju A Aloor told TOI on Friday, “We have filed Saikia’s bail application today and it is expected to come up for hearing before the additional sessions judge, D D Deshmukh, on Saturday.”
 
 The murder occurred between 5pm and 7pm on December 29, 2016, in a room on the ninth floor of the Infosys building where Rasila was working on a project. It came to light around 8.30pm. 
 
 Based on CCTV footage and other findings, the Hinjewadi police had traced and arrested Saikia on December 30 from Mumbai while he was about to catch a train to his native place Lakhimpur in Assam. He is since lodged in the Yerawada jail under magisterial custody.
 
 Saikia’s   is based on the arguments that he has been made a scapegoat. That, the probability of his committing the murder was remote as he is neither a criminal on record nor had ever faced any complaint of misbehaviour in the past. 
 
 He further claimed he did not flee the spot nor did he attempt to destroy evidence considering the body was found near the victim’s work station. CCTV footage too was inconclusive in terms of a case against him. He has further contended that police investigation is practically over and a chargesheet was expected to be filed. Considering his poor family background and the fact that he is the only bread winner in his family, he may be granted the relief of bail subject to conditions the court may deem fit to impose, Saikia has stated.
