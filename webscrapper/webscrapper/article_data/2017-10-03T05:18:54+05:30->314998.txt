NAVI MUMBAI: Two boys aged 13 and 10 living in a   were   on Monday after the elder boy allegedly sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl in her hut in the same area on Sunday morning. The police said that the younger boy had only kept a watch while the alleged crime took place.

 The girl's parents had left for work on Sunday morning, leaving her with her nineyear-old brother. Around 10.45am, her brother stepped out of the house, said the police.“That's when the 13-year-old boy entered the hut and sexually assaulted her,“ said sub-inspector Sopan Rakhonde of Vashi police station. “The 10-year-old stood outside to alert his friend if her brother were to return.“
 
 About 10 minutes later, the girl's brother returned and saw the two boys running out and his sister crying, said Rakhonde.
 
 “On Monday morning the girl, who was in much pain, told her mother about what had happened. Her brother's version buttressed the girl's claim,“ said Rakhonde, adding that the mother lodged a complaint.
 
 The police said a medical test has confirmed that the girl was sexually assaulted by penetration. A criminal offence was lodged and the boys rounded up. They have been sent to a juvenile remand home in Bhiwandi.
