 does not hesitate to open up on himself and his life, despite being a politician, as one can see in his biography 'The People's Maharaja'.

 Amarinder's biography is written by author and columnist  . Talking about it, the author told IANS, "Amarinder emerged as a model for a dispassionate biography, which many political leaders would find hard to emulate. Amarinder never ducked answering a personal or awkward question... I will not hesitate to state that he was the frankest of all the people that I interviewed while doing the spadework of this biography. Also, never during the writing of the text did he request that any insertion or deletion be done. Neither did he seek adulation."
 
 The biography doesn’t just contain details of Amarinder's political career but also details of his early life, his military career and social and personal life. It also touches on his difference of opinion with   and how he came close to leaving the   in 2015 and 1984, over Operation Bluestar; on his relationship with his wife and his friendship with the Aroosa Alam, a Pakistani journalist.
 
 "Usually political leaders would try to control an authorised biography. In an authorised biography, there is always a fear that it will be compromised. Nothing of the sort happened here. As a subject and the author, we both understood the sanctity of not pushing a false narrative," said Kushwant, reported IANS.
 
 The book came out about 20 days ago and has now gone for a reprint already. Coincidentally Amarinder became the Chief Minister of Punjab around the same time when the book was released. 
 
 When asked about Amarinder Singh’s personality, Khushwant said, “He is quite belligerent as a person, if he is decided on something. It's very difficult to convince him the other way. He is a man who is very particular about his personal space, about protocol and conduct in the public space."
