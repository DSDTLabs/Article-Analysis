MUMBAI: The crime branch of the police on Wednesday released images of two suspects in the murder of a 10-year-old boy whose body was found stuffed inside a red suitcase at the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) in January. 

 Crime branch officials said these CCTV images were sourced from a shop in Malad, which reportedly sold the suitcase. “Our investigations have found that the suitcase used in the crime was bought from a shop in Malad and the CCTV footage shows the suspects making the purchase. We are willing to reward those who provide information on them,” a police officer said.
 
 Police have already arrested a private loader, Ramesh Sankat, from his hometown in Madhya Pradesh. He was arrested as he was captured on CCTV cameras with the suitcase at LTT. He has, however, denied his role and claimed that he picked up the unclaimed suitcase at LTT believing that it contained some valuables. He abandoned it when he found a body inside. 
 
 The   have filed an application before the Vikhroli court seeking his brain mapping test. 
 
 Sakat has now told the police that he saw a middle-aged couple alighting from a taxi with the red suitcase. 
 
 “He initially said the couple was accompanied by a minor and then changed it, saying there were two children. We strongly believe that the victim was from Mumbai,” a police officer said. 
 
 On January 7, police found a suitcase stuffed with the body of a boy, aged around 10 to 12, near the parcel office at LTT. The body was clothed in navy blue trousers and a light blue shirt, with a 'Milli Garments' tag. A printed saree and a bedsheet were used to cover the body. The suspect may have reached the platform by crossing the tracks from Sable Nagar slums, police said.
