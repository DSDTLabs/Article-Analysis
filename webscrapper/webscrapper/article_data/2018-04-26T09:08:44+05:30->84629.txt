AHMEDABAD: Controversial former IPS officer DG   says the Jodhpur court convicting and awarding life term to godman Asaram for raping a minor girl is not the final verdict, and believes ‘Bapuji’ will be cleared of all charges by the high court.

 “I appeal to my countrymen and people of   that this isn’t a rape case. We will approach the high court and if need be go to the  . We are hopeful that Bapuji will be declared innocent by the HC,” Vanzara, a murder accused in the   fake encounter case, told reporters here on Wednesday.
 
 “I’ve a copy of the FIR where the survivor doesn’t say that she was raped. Nor has she said it in her statement under Section 164 of CrPC. The chargesheet, too, states she wasn’t raped. The FIR accuses Bapuji of outraging a woman’s modesty,” he said.
 
 Vanzara, 64, spent time in jail in connection with the Sohrabbudin Sheikh fake encounter case. Later, he was discharged in the case.
 
 “Asaram has been framed. A campaign was carried out against Bapuji to bring disrepute to saints and Sanatan Dharma. We respect the Jodhpur court verdict, but will move the HC. And if needed, we will move the Supreme Court,” Vanzara, a ‘shishya’ (disciple) of Asaram, said.
