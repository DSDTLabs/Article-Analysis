After the Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (AAA) debacle, director   has been shooting his next with   Kumar,   Dastur,   Shetty and  . 

 Touted to be a fantasy love story in 3D,   has roped in some of the technicians who are working on 2.0 for this film. “We have finished two schedules — in Chennai and in Ooty. We will begin our next schedule in the city, and will also shoot a portion in Karaikudi. My film is not an out-and-out love story, but it will have a portion that explains true love. You can’t really prove your true love to someone, right? But in this film, the protagonist will go to an extent where he proves his true love.” GV plays a happy-go-lucky guy, who looks after his father’s business. “He is the kind who falls in love quickly. He falls for all the girls, but eventually finds true love... In that sense, the film is, more or less, like a boy’s diary. The film will be fun, but will have its emotional moments.”
