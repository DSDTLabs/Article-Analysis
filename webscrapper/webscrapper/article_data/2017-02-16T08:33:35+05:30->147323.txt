MUMBAI: Around 100 BEST staffers stormed into a 5,616 square metre   in   (W) on Wednesday morning to take possession of land reserved for a bus  . It was a nearly decade-old battle with a real estate   and land owners who vacated the premises only after the Bombay high   and Supreme Court recently gave a verdict in the transport undertaking’s favour.

 The court case went on for four years, with the apex court directing BEST to take possession. For six years before that, undertaking officials had tried to enter the plot on Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Road but were stopped by security personnel and labourers, sources said.
 
 “It is a victory not only for BEST but for commuters in the city. We plan a   station, which will benefit thousands of daily passengers,” said BEST general manager Jagdish Patil. The undertaking plans bus routes from there, besides facilities for conductors/drivers, such as a canteen, toilets and rest-rooms. Sources said BEST can also commercially exploit part of the bus station to generate revenue for the loss-making transport division.
 
 Armed with the court order, senior BEST estate department officials arrived at the premises around 10.30am. “There was slight resistance from the developer’s security guards but they relented as we went with our own 30-40 security personnel,” said an official. More than 20 labourer families’ electricity connections and cable TV dish antennae were taken off and the illegal structures were demolished.
 
 The land, opposite P&T colony in Mulund (W) is considered prime property. It will also provide parking space for some buses. “There are also plans for staff quarters,” said additional general manager Sanjay Bhagwat, who visited the site after the “takeover”.
 
 PLOTTING A VICTORY
 
 * The 5,616 square metre plot was taken from the state government in 2006, under provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling & Regulation Act
 
 * When attempts to enter the plot and fence it failed for six years, BEST filed a petition in Bombay high court in 2012
 
 * After the HC gave a favourable verdict, the developer filed a SLP in the apex court, which was rejected
 
 * Possession of land was taken over by estate manager Mukund Sumant in the presence of security personnel on Wednesday
