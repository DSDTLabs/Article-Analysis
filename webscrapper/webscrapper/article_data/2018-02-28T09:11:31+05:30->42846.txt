The move is aimed at safety of the students,” said  , ACP (traffic). She said that the cops will also notify the district education officer (DEO) about their decision. 
 
 On Tuesday, the entire area around Amitnagar Circle was brimming with cops who were managing the traffic and also stopping commuters trying to take wrong side of the road.
