NEW DELHI: A Delhi   has said that a case put up by the prosecution cannot be discarded if people are not willing to become witnesses, and refused to set aside the jail term awarded to a man for snatching a woman’s cellphone.

 Additional Sessions Judge S K Sharma dismissed a convict’s appeal against a six-month jail term. He had been tried for Section 379 (theft) of the IPC.
 
 “The trial court has also taken very lenient view against the appellant regarding the quantum of sentence and therefore, the order on sentence does not require any interference by this court,” thejudge said.
 
 The appellant had argued that the rickshaw puller who had ferried the victim was not examined during trial.
 
 The court pointed out that it was not “fatal” to the prosecution that independent witnesses are not agreeing to become witness. 
 
 The prosecution had contested saying the woman had boarded a rickshaw at   metro station on February 14, 2013 when Ravi Kumar snatched her cellphone from her hand. The man was held guilty in October 2017 and awarded six months imprisonment by a trial court.
