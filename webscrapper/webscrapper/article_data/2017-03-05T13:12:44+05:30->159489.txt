PANAJI: Thanks to a group of youth who didn’t mind getting their   on a Friday afternoon, murals at the Panaji   complex depicting cartoonist Mario de Miranda’s famous characters, which were defaced by paan and gutka stains, have been restored to their  .

 Armed with scrubbers, sponge wipers and buckets of water, seven youth, under the banner of the newly formed group Revolutionary Goans, spent two hours cleaning up the murals.
 
 Manoj Parab, one of the members, says he was ashamed to see a group of UK tourists taking pictures of the murals. “Pictures of these defaced murals will be seen by people around the world. If we Goans don’t respect our own talent no one else will,” he says, and adds that spitting is not a part of Goan culture.
 
 The youth have put up a no-spitting sign and would like to see CCTV cameras installed near the paintings. They want more no-spitting signs to be put up all over the market complex.
 
 Miranda’s younger sister   has commended their effort. “I can only think of admiring and congratulating them for the brave initiative and hope they will be role models for others to follow. Keeping Goa and India clean is a great initiative. Appreciating art and maintaining it is an example, which hopefully, slowly, others will learn from. Mario was a hard working person and it is heart warming for me to see young people appreciating his creations,” she told STOI.
 
 Last year, on Miranda’s 90th birth anniversary, search engine giant Google paid tribute to the internationally renowned cartoonist with a special Google doodle.
