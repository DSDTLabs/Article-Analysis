BENGALURU: IAS officer   suffered a setback on Tuesday as the Bengaluru branch of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) dismissed her petition wherein she had challenged her transfer order. Sindhuri, who was deputy commissioner of Hassan, was posted as commissioner, department of employment and training, Bengaluru, on March 7.

 The tribunal also observed that D Randeep, who was transferred to Rohini’s place, is deemed to have assumed charge as Hassan DC on Tuesday.
 
 Dismissing her petition, a CAT bench comprising judicial member K B Suresh and administrative member   observed that the circular issued by the department of personnel and training (DOPT) related to creation of a civil services board is unconstitutional. Without a constitutional amendment, a parallel and alternative government in the form of the said board can’t be created, the bench added. “There can’t be an independent authority in the executive governance structure,” CAT observed.
 
 Sindhuri had challenged the March 7 transfer order in CAT and the tribunal on March 21, asked her to approach the chief secretary. Sindhuri challnged this in the   high court and the latter sent the matter back to the tribunal for fresh consideration.
 
 Sindhuri, who was posted as Hassan DC in July last year, had claimed that her transfer was premature and politically motivated. According to her, it violated IAS regulations which mandate a minimum two-year stint for cadre posts. Randeep took charge as the Hassan DC at 6pm.
