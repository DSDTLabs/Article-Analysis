GHAZIABAD: The   will construct a new bridge across the Hindon River along   near   in  . This bridge will replace the old bridge that closed six months ago for traffic, after it was declared unsafe by the district administration.

 A proposal for the construction of the new bridge has been prepared by the bridge corporation and sent to the state government for approval through the public works department (PWD) on Monday. Officials said the entire cost of the new bridge – pegged at around Rs 21 crore in the initial estimate – will be provided by the state government. The bridge corporation will be the nodal agency that will execute the construction work.
 
 A technical assessment report prepared by the bridge corporation following closure of the old bridge revealed that the structure has outlived its utility.
 
 “The old bridge will be completely dismantled before construction on the new structure begins. The piers of the old bridge were constructed during the British era. A new superstructure above the piers had been constructed by the PWD in 1954. The new bridge will roughly have the same dimensions as that of the old structure. However, we are trying to further extend the width of the new bridge to allow more vehicles to pass through. We are awaiting clearance of the proposal from the state government following which construction will commence. The total cost includes dismantling of the old bridge and construction of the new bridge. A timeline for execution of the construction will be worked out once it is cleared by the state government,” said a bridge corporation official.
 
 The old bridge had been closed for vehicular traffic on June 29, 2017 after it was discovered that a portion of its left flank had sagged under the weight of continuous vehicular movement.
