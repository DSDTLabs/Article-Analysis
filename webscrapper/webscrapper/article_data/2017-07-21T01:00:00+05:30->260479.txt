Aashka Goradia’s dream of having a winter wedding is all set to be fulfilled. On December 3, she will tie the knot with her American fiancé,  .
 
 The couple, who got engaged last Christmas, considered many locations, but finally zeroed in on Ahmedabad since it happens to be Aashka’s hometown.
 
 Aashka confirms, “Brent wanted a wedding replete with all the rituals, which seemed possible only in my hometown. Another reason is that I have so many memories associated with the city. I have spent 16 years of my life in Ahmedabad and Gujarat is extremely rich, culturally. I am sure my in-laws will enjoy the traditional garba, gujarati delicacies and the hospitality in my hometown.” 
 
 Speaking about her fiancé Brent Aashka elaborates, “Having the wedding in Ahmedabad was Brent's idea as he had attended my cousin's shaadi in the city. And yes, he is a big fan of Gujarati cuisine and he loves aam ras, theplas, and khaman dhokla. It’s a classic case of American ban gaya Gujarati!"
 
 Aashka met Brent, a former weapons instructor and businessman in the US, in Las Vegas in 2016 and fell in love eventually.
