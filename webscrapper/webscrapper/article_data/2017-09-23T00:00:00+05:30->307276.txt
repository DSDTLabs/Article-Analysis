 Ever since   announced that there would be a sequel to Thiruttu Payale, there was a lot of buzz around the film. The sequel not only has a new set of cast, but the director had also replaced the composer for it. While   composed for the 2006 erotic-thriller, Vidyasagar was roped in for Thiruttuppayale — 2. 
 
 The album’s first song,  , was released as a single and has struck a chord with many. This lilting song is wonderfully rendered by D Sathyaprakash. The soothing guitar portions in the background only adds to the number. The use of minimal instruments in the background and lovely lyrics by Pa Vijay makes this one a sure-shot hit with listeners. This is followed by the theme song of Thiruttuppayale — 2, rendered by Vidyasagar, which has a jazzy feel. Unlike regular theme songs, this one’s quite laid-back, explaining the crux of this film. The use of thavil beats and harmonica adds a different layer to the song. 
 
 The tempo raises in Achukku Buchukku by Sanjana Kalmanje. The song goes on to tell the story of our lives with the use of smileys. The tune is quite average and so are the lyrics. Though the singer packs in the necessary energy, it doesn’t come across as a repeat-worthy number. A passable listen, reserved only for theatres. The album ends with Neenda Naal by   and Shwetha Mohan. This beautifully composed number goes on to prove that Vidyasagar is still strong in the melody game. The singers breeze through your heart with their mellifluous voice, and the tune, too, is instantly likable. The use of sarangi adds an alluring touch to the number. It is great to have Vidyasagar back after a long hiatus!
