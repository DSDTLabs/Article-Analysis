Vadodara: From local to national paddlers, nearly 60 players participated in a table tennis camp organized at Reliance Township in the city. Two Arjuna awardees, Kamlesh Mehta and Monalisa Barua Mehta guided the players during the camp that began on May 4 and will end on Thursday. 

 Of the participants, 50 players are from Gujarat while 10 are from other states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The Sports Authority of Gujarat has nominated 40 players from the state for this camp. 
 
 “The Table Tennis Association of Baroda (TTAB) has been organizing this Residential Advance TT Coaching Camp continuously for last 14 years,” said Kalpesh Thakkar, secretary of TTAB.
