PATNA: The   party would welcome Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s any decision to stand against the   government for special category status to the state, in charge of party’s Bihar affairs   said on Tuesday.

 
 “We are fighting against   and for the due rights of Bihar, including the much-needed special category status. CM Nitish was strongly demanding special category status to Bihar when he was in alliance with us, but he does not seem to be serious on the issue after getting back to the BJP. Still, we will welcome anyone who joins us in our fight against the BJP and for special category status to Bihar,” Gohil told TOI after reaching Patna on Tuesday. 
 
 JD (U) has lately upped its demand for special category status to Bihar. At an all-party meet held on Saturday last to discuss the issues related to the 15th Finance Commission from the viewpoint of Bihar, JD (U) general secretary and   member R C P Singh noted that his party’s long-standing demand for special category status to the state had not materialized yet. He endorsed the recommendation of the   committee under the UPA-II that Bihar was a backward state that needed special assistance.
 
 Bihar Congress’s officiating president Kaukab Quadri also said Nitish should clear his stand on his alliance with BJP. “JD (U) should first clear its stand. Nitish has a secular image. He should first leave BJP, then we will think about the future steps. He had already been in alliance with Congress and RJD,” Quadri said.
 
 Meanwhile, Gohil arrived on a five-day visit to the state. It is his third visit after getting the assignment of Bihar in April. “My efforts are to ensure that Congress performs well in Bihar in the coming days. We are focusing on strengthening the party structure and raising people’s concerns,” Gohil said.
