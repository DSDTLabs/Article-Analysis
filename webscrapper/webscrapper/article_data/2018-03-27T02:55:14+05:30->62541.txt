NEW DELHI:   has introduced laser-based speed   that can be pointed in the direction of the vehicle to gauge its speed. 

 This sophisticated device would eventually complement interceptor vehicles, which are presently used to check and challan those caught speeding.
 
 
  
 
 Cops say the hand-held device was introduced after it was found that vehicles often tend to slow down seeing the interceptor vehicle at a distance.
 
 Special   (traffic) Dependra   said that traffic police has procured 55 guns, which would be deployed at all 53 traffic circles. 
 
 “Training will be provided to all 1,100 zonal officers by the vendor. The guns will be operational in the first week of April,” said Pathak.
 
 The guns can capture a vehicle at a distance of 300 meters and would add to the traffic police’s existing capacity of 22 mobile interceptors. The system is fitted with a portable wireless printer that will instantly issue a slip that can be attached with a challan.
 
 All tickets issued would be recorded in logs detailing the date, time and location of the infractions.
 
 The new systems will be installed in different locations in the city that have been deemed as hotspots for speedsters. These spots have a history of moderate level of offences and will help cops check the effectiveness of the system during peak hours.
 
 Once a   is caught on camera, the photograph of the vehicle will be developed by the machine and printed with the challan to ascertain the identity of the owner and a notice will be sent to the registered address, along with a photograph of the infraction. 
 
 The violator will then be asked to reach a traffic court and deposit the fine.
