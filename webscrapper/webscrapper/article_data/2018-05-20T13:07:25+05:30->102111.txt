VADODARA: Seating arrangement for lawyers in the new court complex seems like a distant dream now. Days after four members of the table allotment committee resigned, all members of the representative committee have written an open letter to members of   ( ) announcing their resignations.

 In the letter, the members have said that after meetings and discussions with elected committee of the association, the representative committee got drawings made by an architect and devised formula for allotting tables to the advocates. 
 
 “To present the formula before the high court’s committee in the form of a resolution, the representative committee and the table allotment committee has requested many times to the elected committee to pass the resolution. But due to some unknown reasons, the resolution has not been passed,” the letter states.
 
 When the representative committee met the committee of the high court judges on May 10 to discuss the issue, the committee asked them to present the formula in the form of a resolution.
 
 In the letter, the members have also alleged that the office-bearers of BBA are avoiding coordination and cooperation with them. 
 
 “We are interested in resolving the issue so that the advocates can function smoothly. It is difficult to guess why there are no responses from the elected committee,” said senior advocate  , who is member of the representative committee.
 
 On the other hand president of BBA Nalin Patel has refused all allegations. “I have not received any letter. The allegation that we have not passed resolution is completely wrong. We have passed the resolution and whatever cooperation they will need we are ready to give,” he said.
 
 On May 11 four members of the table allotment committee too had resigned. Without naming anyone in their letter, the members stated that no temporary arrangement has been made for lawyers to sit therefore they have resigned.
