AHMEDABAD: People living in 83 colonies established to shelter riot-affected people after the post-Godhra riots, will gather in Ahmedabad on Wednesday to observe the 16th anniversary of the incident. 

 The programme is organized under the aegis of 'Internally Displaced People' and 'Alp Sankhyak Adhikar Manch' at  , where social activists including Vadgam MLA Jignesh   will address the gathering and people coming from different shelters will share their experiences. As many as 1,169 persons were killed in the violence which lasted for three months across the state in 2002.
 
 During the riots - which broke out after the burning of the S-6 coach of the   at   station, where 59 passengers including karsevaks were killed - nearly 5,000 families were displaced across Gujarat. Of them, nearly 3000 families still live at in makeshift arrangements, which later became permanent, at 83 site in eight districts.
 
 An activist from Himmatnagar, Mirkhan Makrani, said that the government's attitude has remained hostile towards these relief colonies and hence most lack basic amenities as well. Activist lawyer Shamshad Pathan said they unsuccessfully tried to secure an appointment with the chief minister to present the issues of internally displaced people.
 
 On the other hand, most trials for the major cases of violence are over, except the Naroda Gam case. Appeals filed in the Gujarat high court in the Godhra carnage case and Sardarpura massacre case have been decided. In all cases, except for the murder of British nationals near   in Sabarkantha, convictions have been secured. Interestingly, the state government recently refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) to file an appeal for enhancement of punishment for convicts in the   massacre case.
