KOZHIKODE: State excise minister T P  , on Sunday, hinted at the possibility of re-opening of more bars, beer and wine parlours and toddy shops situated in panchayat areas along highways, which were closed down last year following the   order banning sale of liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways. 

 Speaking to media persons here, Ramakrishnan said a decision on the closed liquor vends in panchayat areas would be taken within a week, in the light of the recent Supreme Court order that allowed state governments to decide on allowing outlets in areas under local self-governing bodies and statutory development authorities.
 
 "There are a lot of toddy shops which were closed down following the earlier   order, which affected thousands of employees," Ramakrishnan noted.
 
 He also pointed out that the   government has not sanctioned any new bars after coming to power, but only gave three- star hotels the permission to sell foreign liquor.
 
 The Supreme Court had in July last year said that its December 2016 order banning sale of liquor sales along highways was not applicable to licensed bars and beverages outlets within municipal areas. Further the apex court had on February 23, 2018 said that the state government could decide whether to allow liquor vends in areas covered by local self-governing bodies (panchayats) and statutory development authorities which may be developed in a manner similar to municipal areas.
