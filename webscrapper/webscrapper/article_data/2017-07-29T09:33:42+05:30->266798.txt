HYDERABAD:   veteran  , the   vice-presidential candidate, on Friday was not sure that his mingling with a sizeable crowd of admirers was something that he would be able to do so once his election as India's next VP becomes a reality. He was also unsure if he would get another opportunity to speak freely in future due to protocol issues that come with that position. 

 On Friday, the BJP stalwart opened up to his admirers and well-wishers in a speech that lasted for 45 minutes. However, his trademark rhyming phrases were missing, a trait that has endeared him to many and frustrated many a political opponent.
 
 On a more serious note,   addressed some of the allegations hurled at him in the recent past. Referring to the charges that his son, who runs an automobile business, had profited from his position, Venkaiah said, "I have never interfered in my son's or daughter's businesses. I did not know much about his business and asked him only after the allegations were made. I was informed that it was a government contract with the manufacturer and the dealership that delivered the vehicles received a commission from company."
 
 He said "people stuck in mud cannot but help throw stones at those who wear a white shirt." He also said he wanted to set the record straight on reports of him being reduced to tears after his candidature was announced for the VP election. "I am not enamoured by any post." "The party has been my mother. It gave me everything. Within five minutes of announcement of my candidature, I resigned from cabinet, sent back government car and left the party. My life from the beginning in the party flashed before me. The thought crossed my mind that I will never step into the BJP head office . I could not hold back and cried. It was not because I was no longer a minister as some media speculated or not because of something to do with   or Telangana. I was overwhelmed at the thought of abandoning my mother," said.
