CHENNAI: Wary of a CBI probe into the  , the   government told the Madras high court unless it was demonstrated that the state government had not conducted an effective or impartial probe, it could not be transferred from the state police and handed over to the CBI.

 When Chief Justice   observed that it was an inter-state crime, Tamil Nadu advocate-general   said the state police had handled many inter-state crimes and cases where the central government officials were also accused.
 
 Pointing out that Madurai bench of the high court had already dismissed a similar PIL, he said there was a clear finding that there was no basis for an apprehension that the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( ) would not conduct an impartial inquiry because a minister and senior officials were involved. 
 
 When the bench sought to know as to how such   were available despite a ban, the advocate-general said it was like the availability of cocaine in many states of the US, though sale of such substances had been banned across the country. “Despite steps taken by the Central government to eradicate black money, it is still prevalent in the society. But not withstanding such lacunae, governments are trying hard to stop such illegalities,” Narayan said.
 
 Union ministry for health and family welfare, in its detailed counter-affidavit, told the bench that sale of any edible good, including gutka, which was injurious to public health, was a threat to a person’s fundamental right to life and health. 
 
 The ministry submitted that use of tobacco is a prominent risk factor for 6 to 8 leading causes of death and that almost 40% of non-communicable diseases including cancers and cardio-vascular diseases are directly attributable to tobacco use. Recording the submissions, the bench posted the plea to Thursday for further hearing.
