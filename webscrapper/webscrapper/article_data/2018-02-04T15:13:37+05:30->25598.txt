SURAT: Economist and former   minister   and eminent tax expert   have hailed the Union Budget-2018 for its focus on agriculture,  , but advised the state governments and the district panchayats to ensure that benefits reached the last man at the bottom of the pyramid. 

 Vyas and Patel had been invited to analyse the Union Budget-2018 at an event organized by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( ) and tax bar associations in the city on Saturday. 
 
 Vyas said, “For me, this Budget is like ‘let God be with us’.” 
 
 Vyas said there is a serious problem with the Indian economy. The reason being that there is a sharp increase in imports at 21.8 per cent, whereas exports are at 12 per cent. There is going to be a cascading effect on the value of rupee against the dollar in the coming years. 
 
 “Immediately after the Budget, the Sensex crashed. This shows the impact on the market as we have faltered on revising our fiscal deficit,” Vyas said. 
 
 There is a serious concern over decreasing industrial manufacturing output. In 2015-16, the industrial GDP was 10.8 per cent, which came down to 7.9 per cent in 2016-17 and later plummeted to 4.6 per cent in 2017.18. The continuous fall in the industrial GDP is not a good sign for the Indian economy, Vyas said.
 
 Mukesh Patel said, “Senior citizens of this country are the biggest beneficiaries of the Union Budget-2018. There was no reason for the government to not give relief to the salaried class when personal income tax revenue had registered 19 per cent growth until January 2018. However, the government has failed to address the grievances of the salaried class.”
