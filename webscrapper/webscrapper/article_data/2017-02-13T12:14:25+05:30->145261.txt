LANSDOWNE: The home to Garhwal Rifles and one of the British hill stations of Uttarakhand, Lansdowne still seems to be stuck in the Raj era.
 The locals still don’t have access to something as basic as a petrol pump and have to travel 30 km to get the fuel filled in their vehicles. Also, people don’t have the access to proper medical facilities. The area has only one hospital -- Cantonment Board hospital -- which also lacks working equipment, locals allege.
  
 Elections have come again, and people of Lansdowne are again weighing their options. It’s again between the   and the BJP.   candidate   and Congress’ Lt Gen (retd) T P S Rawat are locked in a close fight in Lansdowne.
  
 “It is like choosing the lesser evil. None of them have worked for the development of this constituency. We are exactly where we were since the town came into existence,” said  , a retired government official in Lansdowne.
  
 Also, a number of ex-servicemen here seem to be swayed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Especially after the BJP government implemented one rank one pension (OROP).
  
 “OROP is the best thing that could have been done for us. It was stalled for so long,” said retired havaldar Dinesh Rawat.
  Echoing similar sentiment, another veteran B N Kandari told TOI: “So many senior officials, like army chief General Bipin Rawat, belong to the state. Their appointments have sent a positive message.”
