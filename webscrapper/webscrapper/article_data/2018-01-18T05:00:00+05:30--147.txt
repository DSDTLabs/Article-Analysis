Mysuru:   D Randeep said a healthy society can be built only when people voluntarily start maintaining their area clean.

 At the third TOI-led   in Kuvempu Nagar, Randeep held a brief conversation with the students on issues related to maintaining their surroundings clean. “Pourakarmikas clean every day. But the issue is bringing down the pressure on the environment. If we start segregation at source, producing less garbage, most of our problems will automatically get solved,” he said.
 
 “Students need to talk to their parents, neighbours, and others towards making their locality clean and green,” he said.
 
 MCC commissioner G Jagadeesha said that students must ensure green and blue bins in their homes.
 
 “I want the students to take part in the clean Mysuru survey in numerous ways. You can download the app or call 1969,” he said.
 
 “Start your contribution towards a clean Mysuru with small initiatives like not throwing chocolate/ biscuit wrappers on road, alerting others while throwing garbage on road, alerting corporation health department on garbage issues by downloading the swachhata app etc. These small steps will bring a big change in the coming days,” he said.
 
 “We have appointed Clean Mysuru students ambassadors for each school. The designated ambassador will create awareness among his fellow students,” he said.
 
 Mayor M J Ravikumar said the mass movement has been successful in creating awareness among each Mysuru resident on the importance of maintaining cleanliness in their locality. “I have come across several instances where students were convincing their parents to bring blue and green bins to segregate waste at source. This is the real achievement,” he said.
 
 Students also presented a street play explaining the importance of clean and green Mysuru on the occasion. Student representatives spoke about the Swachh Bharat concept and the role of students in creating awareness.
