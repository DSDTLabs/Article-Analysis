LUCKNOW: Lucknow and Agra will soon join the league of cities having piped cooking gas supply. The two cities have been chosen as the first ones in the state where  , a joint venture between  , will provide piped gas connections. The government on Tuesday cleared the proposal of the company to start laying infrastructure for the project. 

 Government spokesperson and cabinet minister   said that the network would soon be extended to other parts of the state as well.
 
 He said that transportation of gas cylinders to individual consumers increased road traffic and also added to air pollution. 
 
 "Green Gas Ltd has been authorized to start laying the network to provide piped gas to households in Agra and Lucknow. These will be underground pipes and therefore, will reduce traffic on the roads to some extent," said cabinet minister Shrikant  .
 
 Sharma said that permission for boring to lay underground pipes would be given on extremely strict conditions. 
 
  "MDPI pipelines will be laid underground using moling technology which does not require extensive and continuous digging. This will not impact any activity on the surface and will take less time. Where it is not possible to dig through moling and open cutting is required, the company will have to ensure proper barricading. The company will be held responsible for any loss or accident that takes place during installation or repair of its pipelines," Sharma added.
