HYDERABAD: The lives of residents living around the city’s 20   stations have become a living hell, thanks to the nauseating stench and uncontrolled mosquito menace around these areas.

 Garbage from these collection stations, located in places such as Jiyaguda, Tank Bund, Imlibun and  , is eventually transferred to the   dumping yard. “The situation becomes worse after a heavy downpour. It is almost impossible to breath,” said Shiva Kumar, a senior citizen living near the collection station in Jiyaguda.
 
 Locals also complain of their homes being filled with dirt, every time there is a slight wind. “To beat it, we have to keep the doors and windows of our homes closed all through the day,” said a home-maker from the same locality.
 
 Adding to this is the mosquito menace. Lashing out at civic authorities for this mess, residents demand that additional fogging is taken up in these areas to resolve the problem. “Due to improper maintenance of collection stations these places have turned into hotspots of mosquitoes and flies. Additional fogging in these areas should be done in order to reduce chances of vector-borne diseases,” said Anil Mutyala Goud, a resident of Nagole and added the areas around these garbage stations have been encroached upon by rag-pickers.
 
 Officials of the  , however, insist that they are doing all they can to improve the condition of people living around collection points.
 
 “The garbage is being transferred to the dump yard on a daily basis. We are roping in water tankers to clean the collection points regularly. Even chemicals that fight the rancid smell are being sprayed,” said K Jagadesh, a GHMC official.
