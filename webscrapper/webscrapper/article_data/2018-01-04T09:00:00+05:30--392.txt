Belagavi: Files pertaining to various development works under the jurisdiction of   (BCC) have gone missing. While officials say that the files have been misplaced, councilors allege that it is a deliberate act.

 The incident came up to light when Minaxi Chigare, councillor, ward no. 48, raised the issue at a recent council meeting. Backing her, many councilors complained of missing files. They said that the missing files pertain to projects which were in final stage of implementation.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Minaxi, said developing a garden in about 6 gunta of land owned by BCC at Shivaji Nagar is a four year-old demand of the local residents. “After many struggle, I got the garden sanctioned in our area. The mayor as well the corporation commissioner approved it. But when it came to the tender process, the files went missing. I have been given different reasons since the past four years. There is no clarity. If the file is not found and garden work does not started till the next council meeting, I will go on an indefinite strike against the officials,” she warned.
 
 Opposition leader in the council, Deepak Jamakhandi said that in the past four years, seven files pertaining to various development works have gone missing. “Even after repeated reminders from councilors, there has been no action. Such cases do not happen with the files of MLAs. Some files are deliberately made to go missing due to political pressures,” he alleged.
 
 Shashidhar Kurer, BCC commissioner, said the missing of files due to human error cannot be ruled out. “But this happens very rarely. The four year-old file of ward no. 48 about garden work has been found and measures are being taken up to implement the project. We are coming with comprehensive plans with the file monitoring system which will ease the process and maintain proper data of all files,” he said.
 
 Kurer informed that that about 200 files move from table to table every day.
