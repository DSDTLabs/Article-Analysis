BAREILLY: Traffic in most parts of the city came to a standstill on Wednesday as a large number of candidates who came to file their nomination papers took out processions here. Commuters had a harrowing time specially at Chowki crossing, the area near the collectorate, the Chaupla crossing, road near   and Station Road. School and college students too faced a lot of inconvenience while going back home in the afternoon after their classes were over. The traffic mess remained the whole day.
 
  A large number of vehicles crammed with supporters of candidates of different political parties started arriving at the city since early morning causing long traffic snarls on city roads. On some stretches, traffic came to a halt for more than an hour while on some roads vehicles moved at a snail’s pace. Pedestrians also faced difficulties in reaching their destination.
  
  
   , a resident of Subhash Nagar, said, “Traffic movement on Station Road and near the collectorate was irritatingly slow. It took me around 30 minutes to reach Civil Lines from my place at   which otherwise takes about 10 minutes on a normal day.”
  
  "Rallies causing traffic jam has become almost a daily feature of city life. The administration should take steps to ensure that traffic problems do not recur and commuters do not face any inconvenience in future," said  , another commuter.
  
  Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (traffic) O P Yadav said, “We had deployed police personnel at all major junctions to ensure smooth traffic flow. Since a large number of candidates and their supporters arrived in the city, some areas in the city witnessed huge traffic jams.”
