THANE: Soon, the   Municipal Corporation (TMC) will make public the   of any structure in the city by posting them online or through media. 

 Experts lauded the decision, especially for a city like Thane where nearly 83 per cent  , according to a   reply from the property tax department, are marked   in the civic records. 
 
 Also, it is often difficult for a layman to determine the legal status of a structure once it has been occupied for several months unlike in under-construction projects, details of the work are put up outside for public information. The TMC will put up details of the approved building plans, along with date of sanction, etc. online for reference of buyers thus eliminating chances of fraud at a later stage.
 
 A directive from the state urban local body has recently identified the importance of equipping the buyer with vital information about the legality of any project or building where he intends to invest. All urban local bodies in the state, including Thane, have been given this order.
 
 "We are starting work on digging out information about all structures from the city and will be putting up their details online or display them at our ward offices. The new directive will help buyers understand the legal status of any structure and make a thoughtful decision," said a senior bureaucrat from the civic body.
 
 The decision was taken after the state government decided against rehabilitating residents staying in illegal structures in various cities based on the findings of a committee probing the Lucky Compound building collapse case. 
 
 "We will henceforth not rehabilitate those staying in dilapidated illegal structures. This will also prove to be a deterrent for residents to cross check details of any project before moving in,‚Äù said Sunil Chavan, additional municipal commissioner.
 
 The civic body is meanwhile finalising a list of illegal and dilapidated structures, said civic officials.
