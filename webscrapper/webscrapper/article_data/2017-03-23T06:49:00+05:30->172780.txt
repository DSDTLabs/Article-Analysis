Noida: Land earmarked for parking facilities at each of the 21 Metro stations along the 29.7-km   will soon be handed over by the   to the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC). It was also decided that the parking facilities will now be developed by NMRC. Earlier, the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities were to develop the parking spaces besides integrating them with the multimodal transport plan to provide commuters for seamless travel on the Metro.

 According to officials of the two Authorities, the decision follows a meeting held on Wednesday. It is evident that NMRC will be developing the parking facilities from the fact that two senior officials from elsewhere in UP have been summoned on deputation to NMRC. “The two officials are the chief architect-planner of Agra Development Authority and the chief engineer of Meerut Development Authority,” Sandeep Chandra, senior project engineer, Noida Authority, told TOI. “They will be providing their services to NMRC every week on Mondays and Tuesdays. We have shared all the details collected so far for putting the parking facilities in place,” he said.
 
 Chandra said land has already been earmarked. “A five-member team comprising a project engineer, an officer from the horticulture department, land department and planning department of Noida Authority, and a representative from NMRC will measure the required land for each Metro station before handing it over,” he said. “The land will be given to NMRC on user rights basis,” he said.
 
 “We have worked out the feasibility and the number of parking spaces to be developed for four-wheelers and two-wheelers,” said Shailendra Bhatia, officer on special duty, NMRC. “We also plan to develop some stations into business hubs. These will be holistic in nature and come complete with malls, retail shops, offices, parking area, police post and restaurants. The aim is to make the Metro stations user-friendly,” Bhatia said.
