Quepem: The Quepem municipal council (QMC) has rejected the three bids it received for a new contractor to take over management of the garbage treatment plant at Pedamoll, Sirvoi, stating that the bids did not fulfill the qualifying requirements. QMC had received three expressions of interest (EOI) from; RajeshreeEnviro solution, Sampurn earth environment solution pvt ltd and the current contractor, Universal Envocare. The council had invited bids from the three contractors after the three-year contract allotted to Universal Envocare, a Mumbai-based firm, had expired on December 13, 2017. The firm was given two months extension till the new bidder could take charge of the plant. “All three, including Envocare, failed to produce qualifying requirements for processing, treating and disposal of garbage under solid waste management rules,” an official from the council said. The bid made by by Envocare was rejected as it failed to enclose the document of minimum average turnover of Rs2 crore per annum, as per the rules of municipal solid waste (MSW). However, at a special meeting, QMC resolved to grant an extension of 11 months to Universal Envocare to run the garbage treatment plant. It has been sent to director of municipal administration for approval. When asked why the firm has been granted an extension despite failing to qualify, QMC municipal engineer Nitin Kotharkar said that the contractor had got the Rs2 crore turnover document, but failed to produce the document along with the EOI application. “Now they have submitted the document and based on that, the council granted the extension for Rs2.65 lakh per month,” Kotharkar said.
