BELAGAVI: A youth group has developed a 10-gunta   into a beautiful   at   village of   taluk without any assistance from the   or any other government agency. This act has become an inspiration for other villages. 

 Under the leadership of Bharma Chingali and Shivaji Jogani, a group of 25 youths in the village came together and started a club about a year ago. They identified an open land near the Shivaji statue in the village for developing it into a garden. 
 
 After taking consent of the GP, the group started worked on a daily basis for almost two months. The group was financially supported by some villagers including K K Palkar, Kashinath Dharmoji, Laxman Tippannache and others. The barren land has now turned into a garden having a well-laid beautiful lawn and different species of plants. The group has erected a fence around the garden to avoid animals straying into it. They have also put up a glass tile near the statue, explaining the history of Shivaji Maharaj. Bhavkanna Sonaji, a group member, said, “Every member of the group worked for an hour for many days to develop this garden. Now too we spend one hour in the garden to maintain it. Once all works are done, we will fix cement seats in the garden so that elderly people can sit there and enjoy their evenings.” 
 
 The group has prohibited chewing of tobacco in this garden.
