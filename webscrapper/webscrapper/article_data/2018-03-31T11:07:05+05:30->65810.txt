CHENNAI: The Union culture ministry has selected Chennai-based Bharatanatyam dancer   as the next   of  , the arts and culture academy established by Rukmini Devi Arundale in 1936.

 Chairman of the foundation’s governing board N Gopalaswami confirmed that Ramachandran has said yes to the culture ministry’s offer. “The final paperwork is being done by the ministry. A formal notification is likely to be issued next week,” he said.  , the former director, had left office in July last year. She had been given an extension of one year after her three-year term ended in 2016. Prior to that, Leela Samson held the post.
 
 Ramachandran is also a dance teacher who specialises in the Melattur style of Bharatanatyam. The dance blog Narthaki. com says she is a specialist in ‘shuddha nrittam’ and that her early training as a basketball player enhanced her stamina. 
 
 Several alumni of Kalakshetra have insisted in the past that only a dancer who is from the Kalakshetra form of Bharatanatyam should be selected as the director. Chennai-based dancer Anita Ratnam had run an online campaign a few months ago when there were reports that a Kuchipudi dancer was likely to get the director’s post.
