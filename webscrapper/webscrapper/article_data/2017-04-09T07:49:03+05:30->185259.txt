AJMER: Devotees from Pakistan who had come to attend the 805th Urs at   dargah got emotional on Saturday when they were returning to their country. The delegation hoped that there should be no boundaries for followers of Sufism in the world. This delegation from Pakistan came to Ajmer on April 1. On Saturday they went back to New Delhi by a special train to return to their country.

 The Anjuman committee of dargah organized a program for these devotees on Saturday morning and wished them a safe journey back home. They also preached the importance of teachings of Sufi saint   and asked the devotees of neighbouring country to spread the message of Gharib Nawaz.
 
 Members of the delegation said that they are fortunate enough to get the chance of participating in this occasion. “I have offered prayers that every year I get chance to participate in such occasion,” said a member of Pakistani delegation. Almost everyone was emotional while leaving the dargah premises and said that message of Sufism is the only way to end hatred in the world.
 
 Meanwhile, Pakistani devotees also enjoyed shopping in Ajmer for their dear ones. Most of them bought ‘sohan halwa’ (sweets), Heena and clothes from the local markets. “Everyone back home is waiting for us to bring something from India and therefore, we wanted to purchase something unique that belongs to this place so that our memories of this place can be remembered for a long time,” said a member of the Pakistani delegation.
 
 For district administration, security for this delegation was an important task and therefore, the railway platform was vacated when the delegation reached the station. No one was allowed to enter the platform and police checked every inch of the area. The delegation boarded at Government Central Girls’ School at Naya Bazaar.
