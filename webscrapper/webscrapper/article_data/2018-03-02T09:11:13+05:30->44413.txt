KOCHI: Corporation authorities who roped in experts like E   to find a solution to the vexed issue of waterlogging in the city, have not been able to do anything concrete so far. The idea was to prepare an action plan within 10 days and to begin works immediately. 

 As part of the plans, Sreedharan, mayor   and corporation and public works department officials had visited Ernakulam Shiva Temple, the Guest House and high court areas.
 
  "Sreedharan accepted the request to help resolve the waterlogging issues. It was found that many outlets of drains opening to the backwaters along the stretch have been encroached or damaged. The team decided to provide outlets to the backwaters at certain points along the stretch. The team also decided to prepare a project for avoiding waterlogging in areas like the MG Road," said a corporation official. 
 
 Sreedharan had opined that the work should have been preferably started two-three months ago. According to him, it should have given them enough time for completing the work before the onset of monsoon. 
 
 "Though a team led by Sreedharan had stated that it would prepare an action plan, nothing has been done so far. If works do not begin immediately, we won't be able to complete them before monsoon," said councillor C K Peter.
