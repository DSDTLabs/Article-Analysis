HYDERABAD: It turned out to be a bumpy ride for global cab hailing giant Uber’s chief operating officer (COO)   on his first visit to Hyderabad. The Uber top gun had to be whisked away in the middle of a press meet to announce a partnership between Uber and Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) after it was punctuated by protests by drivers.

 Moments after Uber and HMRL announced the partnership to improve first and last mile connectivity from city metro stations and officials of both the entities rose to exchange MoU documents,  , president, Jai Driver Anna Association (AP and Telangana) got on to the dais and started venting grievances of drivers.
 
  
 Others present on dais included Telangana IT secretary  , HMRL managing director   as well as Uber India and South Asia president Amit Jain.
 
 “When we visit your office, your bouncers throw us out. What are we supposed to do?... we are forced to come here,” said an agitated Gaud, who was accompanied by a couple of protesters wearing black badges.
 
 Even as officials tried to calm Gaud and coax him to leave the press meet venue, the unrelenting driver thrashed out point-by-point issues faced by drivers and pleaded with top bosses as well as government officials to help resolve matters.
 
 Interestingly, before protesters had entered the venue, Ranjan welcomed the   saying, “Uber has faced some regulatory ups and downs… there are state governments that have tried to put a cap on surge pricing in places like Bangalore, Mumbai, New Delhi … there was a lot of pressure on us as well but we were very clear that this is a market driven model and we will never interfere.”
