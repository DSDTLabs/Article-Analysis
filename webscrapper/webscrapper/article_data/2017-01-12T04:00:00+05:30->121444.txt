Rajkot: At least three fishermen were killed and three others are missing after a fishing trawler caught fire off Jakhau coast in Kutch on Tuesday night.

 Sources said the trawler, ‘Bahubali’, from Okha was engulfed in fire in the Arabian Sea killing three fishermen who were asleep. Three others managed to jump off the boat but are yet to be traced.
 
 The trawler owner, Manoj Babubhai, confirmed the incident and told TOI that search was on for the three missing fishermen. 
 
 “The captain of the trawler has survived,” Babubhai said, adding, “efforts are on to bring the bodies of the deceased fishermen to the coast. The three dead fishermen belong to Koba village in Una taluka of Gir-Somnath district.” 
 
 Babubhai further said that, prima facie, it seems the fishermen had left some burning object near a barrel containing diesel. “This caused the freak fire,” Babubhai said.
 
 He owns Bajarang Sea food based in Okha town of Devbhoomi Dwarka. The fishermen had gone out to sea on January 5 from Mangrol coast. 
 
 “Over 150 boats fishing in the nearby area have rushed to spot and are searching for the missing fishermen,” Babubhai said.
