CUDDALORE: Former CBI director   said the country faces an enormous challenge to provide quality education particularly those in remote locations.

 Kaarthikeyan was speaking at the 81st convocation of his alma mater  ,  , Cuddalore district in the presence of Tamil Nadu governor and university chancellor  , vice-chancellor S Manian and pro-chancellor and higher education minister K P Anbalagan on Saturday.
 
 “India has now 563 universities when compared to 1,100 in China. The irony is that by all accounts hardly 20% of the technical graduates are employable. Even the employable need retraining ,” he said.
 
 He said nearly half of the huge population in the country are below the age of 30 years unlike the rest of the world. “Whether this huge young population is going to be a liability or asset depends upon the nation’s ability to provide opportunities for them to acquire higher education and skills,” he said. 
 
 “In the Time’s best 200 higher education institutions in the world, none of our universities figure. We need more higher educational institutions of high calibre,” Kaarthikeyan said.
 
 Stressing the importance of agriculture in the development of the nation, he called upon the educated youth to voluntarily take up farming as their profession. “Educated youth should not look down upon agriculture and conclude that it is below their dignity to adopt farming. Only then we will be able to revolutionize agriculture and farming in India,” he said. Purohit presented medals to 45 meritorious students, cash prizes to 140 students and awarded degrees to the successful students.
