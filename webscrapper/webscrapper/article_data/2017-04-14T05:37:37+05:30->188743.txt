BHOPAL: Unlike other spies who try to survive and (hopefully, one day) go back home, Pakistani spy Mohammad Sajeed Muneer, alias Sameer Kumar, wants to spend the rest of his life in Bhopal. Not because he likes the hospitality at Bhopal’s detention home or is scared to face the wrath of  , but because of his killer past.

 Muneer says that if he is deported, he would be arrested by Pakistan police and “dumped in dark prisons” for many years over a murder that he committed 13 years ago. His name in Pakistan government records is Abdul and he is a native of a small town bordering Rajasthan. The Pakistani agent is being fed, clothed and sheltered by   since his release from jail 10 months ago.
 
 Muneer had told interrogators that his brother was murdered by a local youth. He killed the murderer to settle scores, said officials who interrogated him. He was on the run from Pakistan police when the ISI approached him in 2003, with an offer he couldn’t refuse. Bhopal police claim ISI trained him for three months (May 2003 onwards) at a safe house in Karachi and he was sent to India in October that year.
 
 Within a few days in Bhopal, Muneer befriended an elderly man named Abdul Salam, who was almost blind, and convinced him to adopt him as his son. After a month, Muneer found himself a job as a data entry operator.
 
 Police arrested him on May 25, 2004, just hours before his wedding to a local girl. During interrogation he narrated how he was roped in by ISI to spy on Army bases.
 
 Now he has completed his sentence and Indian authorities are trying to deport him, but Pakistan refuses to process his documents, say police. Muneer is only too happy to continue to be a Bhopali and has requested local police not to pursue his deportation.
