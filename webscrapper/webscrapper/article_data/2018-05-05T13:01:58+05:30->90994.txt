TIRUPUR: The Tirupur rural police have booked a   case against an unidentified person for impregnating a 31-year-old woman with learning difficulties near   here on Thursday. This is despite the victim’s mother naming their 45-year-old neighbour as an accused in the complaint.

 The police said there were two suspects in the case and that they may seek the judiciary’s intervention to conduct a DNA test to find out the culprit.
 
 The victim’s father had died a few years ago. “The victim used to take goats they rear for grazing after her mother, who is an agricultural labour, leaves for work. Three months ago, the victim fell ill and she was taken to a private hospital, where doctors found she was four months pregnant,” the officer said.
 
 Her mother recently lodged a complaint against a neighbour for impregnating her daughter. The preliminary investigation found that the victim used to visit the neighbour’s house for watching television. The police also found that the victim was often accompanied by a 55-year-old man while grazing goats.
