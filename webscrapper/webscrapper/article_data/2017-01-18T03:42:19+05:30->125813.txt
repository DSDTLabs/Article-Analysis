Gurgaon: The sub-divisional magistrate ( ) has, yet again, ordered a   of school buses in Gurgaon, in the wake of the recently concluded state-wide Road Safety Week. Notably, this is the third attempt in nine months to check whether school buses in the district follow safety norms.

 There are over 1,800 private school buses registered with Gurgaon’s regional transport authority ( ). They must follow prescribed guidelines under the Surakshit School Vahan Policy, including installing CCTV cameras,   and attendants in every vehicle. However, school buses have often been found flouting the norms.
 
 Therefore, SDM Sushil Sarwan has ordered the safety audit in a bid to ensure children’s safety. The decision came close on the heels of the Road Safety Week that was celebrated throughout Haryana from January 9 to January 14. Under the initiative, buses will be inspected randomly without prior notice; road safety officers may also be included in the drive that is likely to get over by mid-February. 
 
 The previous two attempts at completing the audits conducted in May and August last year remained incomplete. 
 
 The first safety audit was conducted by RTA last May, after the policy was adopted, but only around a thousand school buses were given clearance. The remaining buses either did not comply with the norms or were not inspected.
 
 The second audit was initiated in August, after a four-year-old girl was digitally raped in a  . But the audit was never completed.
 
  “The safety of schoolchildren is of concern to us. Schools have had enough time to comply with the court order on the Surakshit School Vahan Policy. They should now be ready to face serious action, in case any lapses are found in compliance,” said Sarwan.
