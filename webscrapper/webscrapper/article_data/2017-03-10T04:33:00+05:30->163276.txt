Ahmedabad: The Medical Council of India (MCI) ordered a re-inspection of two GMERS-run medical colleges, one in Junagadh and the other in Himmatnagar. An MCI delegation had recently inspected both the colleges. Sources said the colleges had failed to meet guidelines because of which another inspection had been ordered. 

 The next inspection will be completed by April 30. If the two medical colleges do not meet certain criteria even after that, they will not be able to admit students in the upcoming academic year.
 
 A new medical college with an intake of 150 students has opened in Vadnagar. The MCI inspection of this college was also completed in January. It too has failed to comply with the criteria laid out by the council and, therefore, has not received approval for admissions. A reinspection is likely to be held at this college too.
 
 The story is no different for Sumandeep Charitable Trust which is already running a medical college in Waghodia. 
 
 The trust had applied for approval to admit 150 students at a medical college in Chandkheda in the coming academic year. However, the trust failed to get MCI approval, agains become of non-compliance with guidelines. The MCI recently also completed inspection in medical colleges at Gandhinagar and Valsad.
 
 Incidentally, the inspection of the medical college in Patan is pending and will soon be completed. The college has sought approval for further admissions after four years of its establishment.
