RAJKOT: After   for three-and-a-half-years,   were released on   on Sunday. 

 Ibrahim Razak Sap and Sajid Umar Sumra were released from the jail at Minab port near Buandar Abbas at 3pm Iran time. However, the third sailor Umar Salemamad Thaim, the captain of the ship, has not been released. 
 
 His brother Van Mohammed Thaim told TOI, “We were told that he was not released with mercy because of some problem in his documents. We appeal Sushmaji (minister of state for external affairs Sushma Swaraj) to use her good offices and help my brother get released.”
 
 Ibrahim’s family was overjoyed on hearing the news. “My mother has not stopped crying ever since she heard of his release. We are extremely thankful to the government of India,” said Mushtaq Sap, Ibrahim’s brother.
 
 The trio was arrested in August 2014 for trespassing into Iran’s territorial waters and sentenced of 10 years imprisonment. They were even fined Rs 2.3 crore.
 
 On February 15, Umar’s wife Nurjahan had written a letter on behalf of family members of all three sailors seeking help of the Indian government at a time when Iran president Hussan Rouhani is visiting the country.
 
 The families on Saturday got a an email reply from the Indian embassy stating: “Matter for waiving off their fine and early release is being taken up with concerned authorities. This embassy is pursuing this case on regular basis and their case has been also raised at ministerial level.” 
 
 The sailors were on the ship which left Dubai to go to Yemen. Due to bad weather, the ship lost direction and entered into Iranian territory unintentionally. There were 12 crew members on board out whom nine were released and three members were charged under the Iranian law. They have been charged for illegal entry in Iranian sea and illegal trading in Iranian territory.
 
 They are expected to reach Ahmedabad after a few days on completion of the formalities.
