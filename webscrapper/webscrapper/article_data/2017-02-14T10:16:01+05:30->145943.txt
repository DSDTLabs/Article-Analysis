LUCKNOW: A rickety cycle in tow, a flag with the preamble drawn in the heart of India's map and a book in hand explaining the Constitution. Sixty two-year-old  , a debutant in politics, has entered the electoral arena from Lucknow east. But what makes his door-to-door campaigning unique is that besides seeking votes, Singh is also spreading awareness on the Indian Constitution.

 Singh, who retired from the post of additional commissioner, UP Co-operative Board, formed the   with his colleague   in December last year.
 
 The trigger for entering politics was, he says, the politicians' apathy towards the Constitution. Pandey is party's national president while Singh is the general secretary.
 
 The idea for `Samvidhan Katha', a storybook form of the Constitution, struck in January 2015 when the duo joined hands to spread the message of 'Jaago Ganaraaj Jaago' (Wake Up Republic). The book was ready in two months, with 10 chapters cove ring the fundamental rights and duties, directive principles, leadership, justice etc., in the form of short stories involving animals, nature, kings and queens.
 
 The party's manifesto and the campaign brochures being given out in the area, also list out the importance and summary of the Constitution.
 
 “When we started, there was not much awareness among people about the Constitution. We went to 500 schools, distributed 5 lakh free co pies and also wrote to the Centre about it. But they forwarded it from one department to another,“ says Singh.“An overwhelming response came from the Manipur chief minister who said that apart from sending copies of Samvidhan Katha to village schools, he would also try to get the Constitution translated in regional languages,“ recalls Singh.
 
 Singh and Pandey also put up a `Constitution camp' in the Magh Mela. “Politicians never tried to spread the real teachings of the Constitution.When we take it to people in the simplest of forms, their eyes open,“ he says.
