Lucknowites witnessed a unique protest against the use of   in the heart of the city at GPO crossing in Hazratganj, by a few members of the   ( ) on Friday afternoon. Passersby were surprised to see a women standing next to the Gandhi statue wearing a coat covered with dolls and holding a placard that read, ‘Everybody Is Somebody’s Baby: Go Leather-Free’. The protest was to urge people to not use animal leather and instead opt for products made of vegan leather or other natural or synthetic fabrics and to also make their wardrobes free of animal-derived materials. 
Many people were very curious to know what was the whole act about, which later the members of PETA explained to them. "The campaign aims to raise awareness towards the abuse that animals endure before their skin is made into coats, shoes, bags, and other products. People will never think of buying coats made of skins of human babies, so why should they wear coats or use stuff made from the skins of cows and other feeling animals who were tormented and slaughtered," said  , the campaign coordinator. 
 Ayushi added, "Animals in India, often crammed onto vehicles in such large numbers that their bones break. Slaughterhouse workers cut the throats of those who survive this ordeal in full view of other animals before dismembering and skinning them, often while they are still conscious. Run-off from leather tanneries poisons rivers and streams, harming all water life. It has also been linked to cancer, respiratory infections, and other illnesses in humans. Unless people stop using leather, the production will never stop nor will the brutal killing of these animals."
 A mini-traffic jam ensued at the busy crossing with curious passersby stopping to look at the girl and the message she conveyed. A few even pledged to stop using leather products.
