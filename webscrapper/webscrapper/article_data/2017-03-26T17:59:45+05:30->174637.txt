 Pune:   on Saturday said it would end its eight-year-old ‘sales and services’ partnership with Japanese automaker   in India from April 1, 2017.
 
 The company did not specify the reason for terminating the partnership, but said “the two have mutually and amicably decided to separate in India.” It appears though, from the sales figures, that Kawasaki was not able to sell enough units in the country.
 
 Kawasaki motorcycles in India were sold through the   dealerships (earlier Probiking network). Bajaj entered into a partnership with KTM to sell the latter’s motorcycles in the country.
 
 KTM has over 300 dealerships in the country. However, it is not clear through how many of these dealerships, Kawasaki sells its units. Kawasaki has over 14 different two-wheelers in the country. Bajaj intends to add 100 more KTM dealerships by March 2018.
 
 Bajaj Auto said that it intends to focus more on the KTM brand, which, it said, has seen a compounded growth rate of 48% since 2012.
 
 Kawasaki paid a share of its profit to Bajaj Auto to use its dealerships. “Profit numbers are confidential,” Amit Nandi, president, Probiking said, when asked about the revenue and profit it made from the arrangement.
 
 “The Probiking network has sold about 6,500 Kawasaki motorcycles in India since 2009, whereas it sold over 1,00,000 KTM motorcycles since 2012 and about 37,000 in the current fiscal,” said Nandi.
 
 Bajaj and Kawasaki came together in 2009, with Bajaj Auto agreeing to sell and service Kawasaki motorcycles in India through the erstwhile Probiking network.
 
 Kawasaki motorcycles will be sold and serviced by India Kawasaki Motors (IKM) Pvt Ltd, through its own dealer network, Bajaj Auto said in a statement. The same was stated on Kawasaki India’s website in a letter addressed to its customers. Currently IKM has 12 dealerships in the country.
