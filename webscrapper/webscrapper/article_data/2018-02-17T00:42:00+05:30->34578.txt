Madurai: As many as 1.76 lakh petitions to avail welfare measures under various government schemes have been received so far through the ‘Amma Thittam’ camps held in the district. Of these, 1.09 lakh have been attended to, so far, Madurai collector K Veera Raghava Rao said at a meeting held in Thirumangalam on Friday. He said that many people had benefited from the programme, which were being held in the 10 blocks in the district on a rotational basis. Minister for revenue R B Udayakumar, who spoke at a meeting held in Thirumangalam on Friday, said that the Amma thittam was an innovative programme which did away with the need for people to travel long distances to get their grievances redressed. Instead, officials from various departments come to the villages and address their needs. Later, minister for revenue and minister for labour, Dr Nilofer Kafeel, who participated in a review meeting of the labour department said a resolution would soon be passed to ensure that the families of construction workers who succumb to injuries they sustain during work, would get Rs 5 lakh compensation. She said that the AIADMK government had implemented many schemes and programmes for the benefit of the working class.  The amount given towards the last rites of a worker who died in work places had been enhanced from Rs 2,000 to 5,000, she said.  The compensation given to families of labourers after their death had also been increased to Rs 20,000 from the previous Rs 15,000.
