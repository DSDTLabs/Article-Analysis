TRICHY: The   felicitated four city colleges for extending their contribution in familiarising   2018 among residents. Four colleges namely Bishop Heber, Holy Cross, Jamal Mohamed and   for Women were awarded with a shield each. The felicitations were part of the Swachh Survekshan 2018 awareness event organised by the directorate of field publicity held here on Wednesday. 
 
 Since August 2017, the civic body has been gearing up for Swachh Survekshan 2018, the annual cleanliness survey being conducted across India for past three years. The urban local body (ULB) said that educational institutions in the city were helpful in creating awareness among the residents. Apart from rallies and other conventional formats of awareness building programmes, city colleges have helped the civic body by conducting door-to-door survey and in familiarising the concept of Swachh Survekshan conducted by the Union government through SBM. 
  
 In January 2018, several   students from city colleges took out an initiative to spread word about the survey by distributing pamphlets across the 65 wards, corporation sources said. “Be it promoting the Swachhata mobile application or creating awareness about Swachh related activities, college students were vital messengers in taking the cleanliness message to public,” corporation commissioner N Ravichandran told a gathering of students.

Stating that microcompost centres are being expanded to all parts of the city, commissioner claimed that the 47-acre large Ariyamangalam dump yard could soon be closed with decentralised waste collection and disposal through microcompost centres increasing its coverage to most parts of the city.
