Social media is like a double-edged sword — it can fetch you both bouquets and brickbats. The latest to draw public ire on the digital platform is  , who is popular as  . 

 Ssumeir regularly uploads videos as Pammi Aunty, his Punjabi alter ego, who voices her opinion on various issues. While the posts, tinged with wit and sarcasm, have always been received well, all hell broke loose after he spoke against the hullabaloo over   and   naming their firstborn,  . In the video, Pammi Aunty says that a name does not reflect a person’s character. For example, she reasons, a child named after the Gods could also grow up to be a hardened criminal. However, recently, the actor’s manager started getting calls, demanding that the video be pulled down as it hurt their sentiments.
 
 Ssumeir says, “It was a sarcastic take on how people take names so seriously. Though the video was posted in December, my manager started getting calls a few weeks ago. Some people, who claimed to be members of a right-wing organisation and followers of a controversial Godman, threatened him with dire consequences if I didn’t apologise and pull down the video. I took it easy for sometime, but my manager was so harassed that he stopped taking business calls. So, I pulled it down a week ago.”
 
 Ssumeir adds, “The video wasn’t created with an intention to offend anyone; I wasn’t targeting anybody. It’s their problem if they took it personally. People should take things lightly and let others be.” Isn’t he setting a wrong example by succumbing to such pressure? “I wouldn’t have done it, but I didn’t want my manager or his work to suffer,” Ssumeir replies.
