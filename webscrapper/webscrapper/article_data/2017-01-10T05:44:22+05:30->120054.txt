MUMBAI: Reports of simmering discontent in the Aaditya Thackeray-led  , the  's Gen. Next cell, have sent   into a tizzy, it is learnt. Scores of Yuva Sainiks are said to be upset with  's "pro-rich" lifestyle and the growing clout of his non-Marathi friends in the cell. Aaditya is all set to assert himself politically in the BMC elections slated for February. 

 However, Yuva Sena activist Amar Pawle's recent post on social media criticizing Aaditya has sparked a crisis in the cell ahead of the BMC elections. Thackeray promptly expelled Pawle from the party. This has snowballed into a controversy as the middle-rung Yuva Sena activists are angry with Pawle's arbitrary expulsion, it is learnt. Many could be on their way to BJP, sources said.
 
 Many Yuva Sainiks think Aditya spends too much time with his upper-crust friends, and his policies too are oriented to woo the wealthy class from south Mumbai. Also, there is an increasing dislike for the clique, referred to derisively as the BKC Club by dissidents within the party, surrounding Aaditya.
 
 Haji Arafat Shaikh's undisputed leadership of   (transport cell) has triggered resentment in the party as Shaikh is seen as an upstart who left MNS and joined the Sena for better prospects. 
 
 Sena functionaries are peeved with Aaditya for trying to alter Sena's time-tested agenda. "The Sena flourished in Mumbai's underbelly. Balasaheb lost sight of his sons-of-the-soil credo. However, Aaditya is influenced by his non-Marathi friends who are known only for their hep lifestyle. They accord priority to issues relevant to upper class Mumbaikars -- night life, open gyms and sprucing up south Mumbai," said a former Sena corporator who honed his skills under Balasaheb.
