Dhanbad: An FIR was lodged against unknown persons in Navalshahi police station and a probe was launched after fishplates from the Koderma-Maheshpur railway track were found missing on Friday. 

 Ramswaroop Meena, a railway employee, averted a major mishap when he found the fishplates missing near the Navalshahi railway station, 26 km from Koderma, just an hour before the Koderma-Kanwar passenger train was scheduled to cross the spot. Meena immediately informed the station master concerned who stopped the train. A team, led by deputy SP Chandraeshwar Prasad, reached the spot and the train was allowed to cross the area only after the tracks were repaired.
 
 "The removal of the fishplates could either be an attempt at robbery or sabotage. We are probing the case," divisional RPF commandant A N Jha told TOI. The sabotage angle stems from a similar derailment attempt four days ago in Burdwan district under the Asansol rail division of the Eastern Railways when concrete slabs were found on the tracks.
 
 "Since it was Republic Day, the railway police force (RPF) were on high alert. Meena will be awarded by the divisional rail manager (DRM) on Saturday. We are also planning to recommend his name for the highest national rail award," Jha said.
