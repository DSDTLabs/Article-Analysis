Chandigarh: A parent from EWS (economically weak section) category has filed a   with education department against a private school in Sector 33 stating that they are being forced to pay full school fees even as the child was admitted under EWS category. The complaint has come three months after a private school in Sector 33 wrote to education department that they are shifting 22 EWS students to general category as their families have crossed the required income limit of Rs 1.50 lakh for EWS.

 The school in its letter subject to the district education officer Chandigarh, dated June 8, had stated that, “This is to bring to your notice that 22 students from the EWS category admitted between session 2011-12 to 2016-17 are being shifted to the ‘general category’ with effect from April 2017-18, as per request since they have crossed the eligibility criteria of the income limit of Rs 1.5 lakhs.” The parent stated that an inquiry in this regard should be initiated against the school’s action. Talking to TOI he said that even if the school is allowed to charge fees, the half of what is to be charged should be waived off. “Even if someone has crossed the income limit, how does he or she becomes competent to pay such high fees? Department should not allow such practice.”
 
 “My salary was Rs 12,000 earlier and now it is RS 13,000, which makes it Rs 1.56 lakh annually. My income now is Rs 6,000 above the limit. But how can it mean that I can afford to pay such high fees, which is around Rs 10,000 for a quarter? Weren’t the schools asked to give free education till class VIII?” he questioned.
 
  The principal of the school, Taruna Vashisht in defence said, “ Only those parents have been asked to deposit the  , who have given in writing that they have crossed the eligibility criteria and want to shift their wards to be shifted to the general category.”
