Trichy: The 540m long bridge over the Cauvery river connecting Srirangam with the mainland is swarmed by residents in the evening to enjoy the pleasant breeze to evade the sultry weather.  Making good use of the opportunity, a lot of pushcart vendors selling snacks have been cropping up in the vicinity. The lack of dustbins and in the absence of any regulations, food waste along with plastic covers are dumped on the river bed. Same is the condition of the Uyyakondan canal and the adjacent link road, where despite the presence of a few bins the water body is being polluted.  With about 2.46 lakh households and population crossing 9.2 lakh, the landlocked city has got very limited hangout spots including a few multiplexes. Cauvery Bridge is emerging as one of the most preferred destination for families to spend time in the evening. Cashing in the situation a lot of mobile vendors have started to sell food on the bridge.  “As the summer vacation is underway, the Cauvery Bridge attracts a lot of families. The presence of snack sellers have been gradually increasing without proper facility to dispose of food waste,” said S Gunasekaran, resident of Thiruvanaikoil. Apart from mobile vendors selling snacks, visitors also bring snacks from their home which are also disposed on the river bed.  Locals also complained the inadequate number of dustbins placed on the bridge as one of the reasons why residents dump waste on the river bed. “Placing adequate bins on the bridge could prevent litter from reaching the Cauvery bed while sensitisation through awareness hoardings could fan a behavioural change among visitors,” said T Santhanakrishnan, Srirangam resident.  Same is the condition of Anna Nagar link road running parallel to Uyyakondan canal as pushcart vendors have increased significantly and waste is dumped in the canal. Residents said that earmarking specific place for food vendors with proper facility for disposal could prevent pollution of the water body.
