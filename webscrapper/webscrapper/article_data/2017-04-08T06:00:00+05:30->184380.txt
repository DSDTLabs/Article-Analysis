The   that were announced on Friday gave director Tharun Bhascker plenty to cheer about. His debut feature   won two National awards —   and  . The filmmaker is overwhelmed. “It’s still sinking in... I’m trying to be all calm and composed; but to be honest, I’m very excited. I am on cloud nine! When the announcement was made, I was watching a movie. It’s only when I got out of the theatre that I saw my phone was flooded with congratulatory messages,” he says, adding, “I miss my dad today; he would have been very happy about this achievement of mine. He passed away in 2015, just after we started shooting for Pelli Choopulu. I believe his blessings are with me and the film.”

 Vijay Devarakonda, who became a star overnight with Pelli Choopulu, is also delighted. “I was dubbing for  , so my phone was on silent mode. Later, when I checked my phone, I saw over 50 missed calls. There were tons of messages too. I’m elated,” says Vijay, adding, “This brings back a lot of memories from the time when we started shooting. I knew the film will be good; but all I expected was that I’ll get to do one-two more films after it releases. I never thought that it will become such a massive hit. It’s been over a year now but accolades are still pouring in; people are still talking about it as if the film released just yesterday.”
 
 Tharun Bhascker, who also wrote the award winning dialogues for the film, feels vindicated. “I think, the respect for smaller films will grow now. I’m sure a lot more story-centric films will be made now.”
