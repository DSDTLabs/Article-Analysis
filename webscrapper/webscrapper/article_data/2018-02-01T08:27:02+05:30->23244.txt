NEW DELHI:   Arun Jaitley will today present the NDA government's fifth Budget. He faces a tough task given the upcoming assembly polls in eight states - including three major states ruled by the BJP - and   next year. In the context of these upcoming elections, especially, these are the five so-called populist spending areas that will be keenly watched:

 
 
 
 : New rural schemes and increased funding for existing rural programmes like MNREGA, rural housing, irrigation projects and crop insurance.
 
 
 : New incentives for the farm sector, which is in considerable distress.
 
 
 : The uneven rollout of the Good and Services Tax (GST) and the demonetisation move has hurt small businesses. Budget-watchers are curious to see if there will be any sops to ease the pain caused to these small businesses.
 
 
 : The bulk of the electorate is formed by the common man, who will be looking for relief in income tax by way of a rise in the exemption limit.
 
 
 : A tax break on capital gains from stock investments may go. And there are reports that the corporate tax rate will be lowered to 25 per cent from 30 per cent over four years.
