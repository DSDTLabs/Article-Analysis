Vellore: A day after hailing the state government’s effort to promulgate an emergency ordinance for the conduct of jallikattu,   leader M K Stalin on Sunday changed his stand and said that people have lost faith in chief minister O Panneerselvam, which was evident when they protested against him in Alanganallur, one the main   hubs in the state.

 Hailing the youth and students’ protest as ‘Marina Revolution’, Stalin said the government had failed to win back the confidence of the people. The CM and other ministers, who went to inaugurate jallikattu events all over the state, faced the wrath of people, he said. If the government had passed the ordinance on time, jallikattu would have been conducted during the Pongal festival. But, the delayed response of the government has led to the present scenario. The people did not believe the CM anymore as he failed to act on time, Stalin said.
 
 He said the CM should meet students, youngsters and villagers who are protesting against the jallikattu ban. The CM should explain to them the measures taken by the government and how it would pave way for conduct of the traditional sport without any legal hurdle in the future, Stalin said. The CM should also ensure that normalcy returns to the state, he added.
 
 President of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee S Thirunavukkarasar, in a statement, said the TN government’s ordinance would not help in anyway to conduct jallikattu in the future. The pro-jallikattu protestors are citing legal provisions created by the DMK government in 2009 to conduct the sport, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2014. Blaming the BJP government for the present scenario, he said only the Union government had the power to bring about an Ordinance and include bull in the list of performing animals. This would ensure that jallikattu would be conducted without any legal hurdle,   said.
