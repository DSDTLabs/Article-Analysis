BENGALURU: A 33-year-old  , suffering from   (AVM) -a tangle of abnormal and poorly formed blood vessels in the brain -underwent a   at a hospital in the city earlier this month. “There are probably 25,000-30,000 people suffering from this condition in India. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with three aneurysms. This is rare, as there are less than 5,000 people in the country suffering from AVM and multiple aneurysms at the same time,“ said Dr D V Rajkumar, director, neurosurgery , Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road. He operated on the Ghanaian.

 The patient, Emanuel, was first diagnosed with this condition in 2012, when he suffered a severe headache and lost consciousness. This brain haemorrhage led to a partial paralysis attack. The first hospital he went to was not equipped to deal with the situation. His symptoms were treated but not the cause.
 
 “I had been suffering from severe headaches, dizziness and loss of balance. Additionally, the right side of my body, including right leg and arm, were very weak.“
 
 During the  , the three aneurysms were clipped with titanium clips and the malformation was removed. Emanuel says his right leg is still weak, but doctors assure this will reduce gradually over time. “I didn't think I would survive, but only a week after the surgery, I was walking again and will be able to restart work soon,“ Emanuel said. He has been advised not to do strenuous work for now.
 
 Doctors say AVM is genetic in a few cases but mostly a random phenomenon. It shows up in people in the 30-60 age group.
