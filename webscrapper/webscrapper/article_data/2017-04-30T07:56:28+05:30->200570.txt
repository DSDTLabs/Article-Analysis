NAGPUR: Two Mumbai-based   on Thursday testified through video conferencing before Justice   at the hearing of a gang rape case under   of Organized   (MCOCA).

 Though the city courts conduct proceedings through video conferencing in many cases, the technology was used for the first time in a MCOCA case. 
 
 The then additional chief of police  , who had approved MCOCA charge, was one of the officers who testified before the court. The other officer was former chief of police SP Yadav, who had approved the charge sheet which was filed in the court. Currently, Pandey is posted at Maharashtra State Police Housing and Welfare Corporation Ltd and Yadav is director general of police, legal and technical at Mumbai. 
 
 The case was filed at Imambada police station in May 2015 after a 17-year-old girl was allegedly gang raped at dermatology ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). 
 
 The police had arrested Ganesh Satpute Karunanand Moon, Nitin Bairisal and Rohit Tambe. Bairisal had been booked for murder in an earlier case.
 
 Earlier, Yadav and Pandey had visited the city to testify in another gang rape case before the MCOCA court. During Yadav’s tenure, 23 MCOCA cases were registered within an year.
 
 Yadav said that it was a good move. “This type of cost-effective and fast technologies should be encouraged for speedy justice,” he said. 
 
 Vijay Kohle, special public prosecutor for MCOCA cases, said that videoconferencing arrangements were made in coordination with the Mumbai team. “Initially, there was a connectivity issue but soon the hearing proceeded without a glitch,” he said. The accused were also present in the court.
 
 One of the defence counsels, Praful Mohgaonkar said that there were no technical issues form their side.
