Producer of the show ' ',  , is a very happy woman considering her show is being appreciated by the audience as well as critics. She says, “There has been an excellent response and I think the unpredictable twists are keeping the audience hooked and story is moving really fast right now. In fact, after so long, when I had the time to have a glimpse of it, I was quite literally stuck by it!”
She says that the success is because the characters on the show, like that of Nisha played by  , have connected with the audience. She explains, “It is surprising, but now when I come across people and talk to them, they say that a person like Nisha (Ridhi Dogra) existing in a family is not believable. But when we look around, people like her do exist but may be not to the extent Nisha is. I personally want to kill Nisha at each and every instance and I say this!” 
 The casting of the show, too, according to Sapna, has been spot on. She says, “We lucked out with the casting in 'Woh Apna Sa'. Actually, the way the characters were written when we decided to cast them was the thing we got right. Like, Disha is what the character is, she totally relates to the character. Ssudeep, too, is the person playing exactly what is expected of the character. But Ridhi is different. She is not like Nisha. Sher is totally opposite of what she is playing, but still she is playing the character beautifully.” 
 At the end of a tough day, Sapna says it is the support of her husband and her kids that drives her. She says, “At the end of the day, I love to unwind with my husband and kids. The minute I see them I feel rejuvenated!”
