SALEM/ERODE: Members of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and its allies on Monday staged protests across the northwest zone of Tamil Nadu including Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Erode districts against the Centre for not constituting   (CMB). 

 In Salem, about 500 people protested in front of the Salem head post office near Old Bus Stand. “The central government failed to set up the CMB within six weeks as per the   order. The government did not care about Tamil Nadu and it is apathetic to the struggles of farmers in the delta districts,” said Salem north MLA R Rajendran, who headed the protest.
 
 He criticised PM Modi for giving importance to Karnataka assembly election. He also slammed the state government for not opposing the central government on the issue. 
 
 At Edappadi, a verbal argument erupted between former   member T M Selvaganapathy and   police inspector  , when the latter warned the protesters of arrest if they continued to block a road. At last, the protesters withdrew the protest after senior officials including Sankari DSP Ashok Kumar asked them to. 
 
 In Erode, a handful of Thanthai Periyar Dravida Kazhagam cadres entered into the premise of Erode head post office and locked the main door. Subsequently, the Erode town police evicted them from the building. Then, the protesters blocked Railway station-Panneerselvam Park Road. Finally, the police arrested them. 
 
 Similar protests were held in Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri districts.
