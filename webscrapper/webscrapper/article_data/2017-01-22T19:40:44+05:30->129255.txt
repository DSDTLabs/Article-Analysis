LUDHIANA: Dubbing  's   (AAP) as a ' ' (gang of thieves),   president   on Sunday said he would shatter chief minister  's prestige to smithereens in Lambi, just as the Akali leader had shattered the pride of Punjab and its people in the past 10 years.
 
 While addressing rallies at Gill and Sahnewal constituencies of Ludhiana, the Congress leader clubbed Kejriwal and Badal as 'meesne lutere' (cunning thieves), saying both of them "deserved to be thrown out of Punjab". He also appealed to the voters to ensure a two-third victory for the Congress to save the state from the clutches of such "goondas".
  
 Hitting out at Kejriwal, Captain Amarinder asked why he did not trust Punjabis and was stationing outsiders on poll duty in Punjab.
  
 Reiterating that he had chosen to contest from Lambi to give a good thrashing to Badal, the Congress leader said he would teach the chief minister a lesson and also give a lesson to all politicians that they could not hope to get away with cheating and looting people.
