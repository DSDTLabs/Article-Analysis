NEW DELHI: BJP MLA from   Manjinder Singh Sirsa has written to LG Anil Baijal, requesting him to order recovery of the cost incurred in holding the special session of   assembly from  . He has justified the demand, saying that the session was nothing more than a “blatant misuse of a constitutional institution” by the party to promote its own political agenda at the cost of public money.

 Sirsa said that “the special session of the assembly was used as a platform to display tampering of EVMs only to satisfy the ego of party convener and Delhi chief minister   and also to save his fast eroding image”.
 
 He said that if AAP had wanted to show this to its own members, it could have done so on the premises of its party office. “If it was a show for media, then it could have been organised at any public place,” Sirsa said. 
 
 He added said that “huge amount of money was spent on the special session, which was not required to be called for such an exercise”. 
 
 He urged the LG to not only order recovery of cost of special session but “also issue a stern warning to the Kejriwal government to desist from indulging in such exercises”.
