CUTTACK: To ensure proper monitoring during the matriculation examination, the   has launched a new initiative this time.

 
 As per the new reform measure, centre superintendent deployed at the examination centres will have to send all information related to the exam like number of absentees, students held for malpractice, how many students appeared the exam and how many squads visited the centre, online by 3 pm to the Board office here on each exam day.
 
 This is for the first time that such a measure has been taken to ensure error-free recording of facts. Earlier, the centre superintendents used to send all this information to Board office manually and two to three days time was lost in the process.
 
 "By the time, the information reached us the examination was almost over. However, the new system will help us to know about the irregularity immediately and we can take appropriate remedial action for it," said Board's president,  .
 
 A special section has been created on the Board's official website where centre superintendents can log in and provide all information related to their respective centre in the specific format. All centre superintendents have been given log in ids and passwords.
 
 The Board will start a trial run of the link from Tuesday to make the centre superintendents well-versed with it. After 3 pm, the district education officers will check the link and will initiate action against the centre superintendents who have not uploaded the information.
