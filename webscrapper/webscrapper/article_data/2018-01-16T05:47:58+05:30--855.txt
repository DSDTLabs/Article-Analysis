BENGALURU: KPCC vice-president   and   media convener AN   on Monday filed a complaint with the city police commissioner, seeking legal action against a man who posted videos claiming it to be a pre-election poll survey. The survey predicted a poor show by the ruling Congress in the assembly elections. Naming the suspect as Deepak Avasthi, founder-director, CHS Surveys, JP Nagar, the complainants said he had uploaded the election poll videos on social media recently.

 “Claiming that the survey was done on direction from state Congress president  , the accused uploaded videos saying the Congress will get fewer seats compared to the previous election. This is false news as   never asked anyone for a poll survey,” the complainants said. In a press release, Parameshwara also clarified that he had never assigned anyone to conduct a poll survey.
 
 City police commissioner T Suneel Kumar forwarded the complaint to DCP (South) SD Sharanappa for necessary legal action.
