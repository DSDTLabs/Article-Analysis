NEW DELHI:   chief  , while inaugurating election offices of party candidates across nine municipal wards on Wednesday, slammed AAP and BJP for stalling development work in the city.

 The DPCC chief said Delhi continues to struggle with civic issues though BJP has ruled the corporations for over a decade and AAP, which has been in power for two years, has done nothing worthwhile. He also pointed out towards the recent poster war between BJP and AAP and claimed that both parties believe in blame-game while Congress is urging people to discuss their issues with them.
 
 “BJP has accepted that its civic leaders were corrupt by not giving tickets to sitting councillors. The corporations were deep in corruption under the nose of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but he didn’t take any action. He suddenly realised the truth while distributing tickets,” Maken said.
 
 Maken said that the condition of the corporations was so bad that dengue and chikungunya claimed the lives of many innocent people. “BJP and AAP took no measures to contain these diseases. It was unfortunate that sanitation workers had to go on strike five times to get their salaries,” he added.
 
 Slamming CM  , Maken said ever since he was elected, he has been looking for excuses for not doing any work and has indulged in fights with the Centre.
