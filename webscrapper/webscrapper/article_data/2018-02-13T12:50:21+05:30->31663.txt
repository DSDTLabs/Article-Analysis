Krishnagiri: A fire broke out in a rubber toy manufacturing unit owned by   at Gurubarapalli near   in   district on Monday evening.

 The fire started at 3.30pm and reason for it was yet to be found, said police. As soon as thick smoke started emanating from an unknown source, all the 12 employees working inside the unit came out without suffering any injuries. They informed the Krishnagiri fire and rescue services personnel, who rushed to the spot and were trying to douse the fire for more than five hours before the edition went into print.
 
 “It was difficult to bring the fire under control as easily flammable items like about 1,000 old tyres made of carbon black, rubber and rubber chemicals as well as other oily items were stored to be recycled for making toys,” said a fire department official. 
 
 The fire has reduced many items to ashes, said the official. 
 
 Even as the official refrained from estimating the loss, the unit owner,  , 46, said, “Going by the initial reports, the damage would be about Rs 1 crore. But the exact loss would be available only after a couple of days.”
 
 The Gurubarapalli police have registered a case and initiated the probe.
