JAIPUR: The alumni association of St Xavier’s and the teaching staff at the school’s Nevta branch have come out in support of the PTI teacher who is charged for abetment of suicide in the case related to Class IX student’s death.

 
 “It is the responsibility of both teachers and parents to discipline a child. The concerned student was caught bunking classes and was taken to the vice-principal, who initiated a disciplinary action against him. His parents were called. However, no one expected that he will take such extreme step which we deeply regret. He had been caught bunking classes prior to that day and had been counselled along with his parents,” said  , secretary of the St Xavier’s alumni executive committee, while addressing a press conference on Friday. He appealed that no presumtions be made.
 
 A similar statement, released by the teaching staff, read “There is absolutely no question of any mental harassment of the student. The concerned PTI, even though he did not teach him directly, was a member of the disciplinary committee of the school. In fact, any member of the staff who would have found a student bunking the class would have followed the same disciplinary procedure.’’
 
 Nitant Raj Laata was found hanging inside his room at his   home on April 26. A suicide note was recovered from his room in which the student alleged that a PTI teacher had harassed and insulted him in front of other students. A case under section 306 (Abetment of suicide) of IPC was registered, following which the PTI teacher Geo Verghese was arrested.
