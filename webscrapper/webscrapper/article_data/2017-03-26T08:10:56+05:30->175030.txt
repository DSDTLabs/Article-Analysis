DHARAMSHALA: Virat Kohli was spot on with his reading of the pitch on the eve of the fourth Test here, when said it will have something in it for everyone. On Saturday, Steve Smith scored a century;   got the ball to jump; and most debutant spinner   tied the Aussies with his chinaman figures of 4/68. But Australia wicketkeeper Mathew Wade said it had a lot to do with cracks in the strip.

 He hopes cracks come into play on Sunday morning to push the hosts on the back foot. “The cracks are playing a huge role for the spinners as well as the quicks. We will be looking to get a bit out of those tomorrow and hopefully we can grab our opportunities,” said Wade.
 
 Australia bowled one over at India before stumps, and Wade was quick to point out the carry in the track, which he said was the best of the four pitches this Test series has been played on. “The one Josh (Hazelwood) bowled overdid, and it was quite enjoyable to have the ball coming at shoulder height behind the stumps. It got us a little excited. Hopefully it continues tomorrow, and Patty (Cummins) and Josh can pick up early wickets. But definitely it's the best carry we have seen throughout the series for sure,” he said.
