AMRITSAR: Netizens have come out in support of Canadian defence minister   after a video surfaced showing him eating cherries while sitting in his car and throwing seeds on the road with a man, presumed to be the owner of a nearby shop, getting angry at him while identifying him as a big officer.

 The video, which is viral on the net shows Sajjan dumbfaced after the man, who is believed to be the owner of  , approached him while he was in the driver’s seat of a car bearing registration number EET 99D and rudely asked “who you are” to which Sajjan replied “ I had come to the meat shop”. The man further said, “You are a big officer, I know you. I am recording everything, who made you such a big officer.” Sajjan tried to reply to the agitated man but he just refused to listen and said, “You are eating cherries and throwing pits on floor, who made you a big officer.”
 
 “It is a small mistake by the minister. Everyone makes such types of mistakes but the reaction by the shop owner is huge and is condemnable,” wrote   in his comment posted on the social media.
 
 Another netizen   writes, “Oh, I think that was so hilarious, head of NATO forces caught throwing pits. Guess if that was peanuts, would have been more funny…Give that guy some space he got nukes under his command and he looked so innocent and completely ducked.”
 
 When the video went viral, another picture was posted on social media with Sajjan flanked by a crowd of Sikhs in front of the gurdwara with cherries in their hands.
 
 Harminder Kaur wrote in her post, “First of all, just look at the video and you can tell Sajjan wasn’t throwing the seeds and being rowdy, he was enjoying the fruit and absent mindedly throwing the seeds. This moron decided to play superman and record the video and then despite his s**t language, Sajjan was so humble. You are a jaloos, Mr shop owner.”
