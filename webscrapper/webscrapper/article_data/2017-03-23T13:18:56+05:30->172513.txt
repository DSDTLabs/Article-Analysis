Pune: Air pollution in the city's fringe areas is possibly taking a turn for the worse because of the prevalence of stone crushing units and   on   roads. 

 A recent investigation by the   ( ) revealed that the pollutant concentration at five monitored locations in Wagholi, Lonikand, Bhavadi and Perne in the fringes of the city were twice, thrice and even six times the maximum permissible limit.
 
 The investigation followed directives to the MPCB from the   (NGT) to monitor nearby localities where stone crusher units are located and to identify possible sources of air pollution there. Heavy traffic on poor quality roads, dumpers travelling from quarries, sporadically located hot-mix plants, ready-mix concrete plants and blasting in the quarries during the evening hours were found to be the main sources of air pollution in these area.
 
 The MPCB team tried to gauge the impact of stone crushing in the area via ambient air quality monitoring at five locations, all residential, in two rounds of 24 hours each. The first round coincided with a working day in November last year for stone crusher units while the second round was on a non-working day, also in the same month.
