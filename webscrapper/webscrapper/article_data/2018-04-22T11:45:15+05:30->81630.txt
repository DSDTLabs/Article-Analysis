PANAJI: Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) chairman   said on Saturday that he is open to reconsidering the April 4 decision to hike the lease rent for industrial units. However, he insisted that the industrial sector has to “meet us halfway”. A senior GIDC officer said that legal opinion would be sought to review if the rent could be hiked without the consent of individual lease holders.

 The move to hike the rents was slammed as “illegal” and akin to “extortion” by several industry bodies, including the   (GSIA),   (GCCI), and the  . 
 
 “I am looking into it. We will have another meeting with GSIA and GCCI to take a call on it. We are not looking to put any industries in difficulty,” he said.
 
 He said that while GIDC was making an effort to be pro-industry, its financial situation required that tough decisions be made. “It is not possible to keep everyone happy. Somewhere we have to cross the line. GIDC must function, but not at the cost of entrepreneurs,” he said.
 
 “ The matter will be brought before the board,” a senior GIDC official said. 
 
 “GIDC plans to bring in an online system for ease of doing business,” Ticlo said. “We will not be able to do this if we don’t have funds.”
