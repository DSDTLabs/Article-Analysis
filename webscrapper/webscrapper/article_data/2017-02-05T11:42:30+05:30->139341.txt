RANCHI: A Class XII student of   (KGBV), Barkagaon (Hazaribag)   on Saturday morning. 

 The deceased, Deepa Kumari hanged herself to the ceiling fan at the school hostel's store room at around 9:30 am. Officer in-charge of Barkagaon police station, Aqil Ahmed said, "The girl committed suicide when other students had gone out for morning assembly. This seems to be a case of a failed love affair."
 
 A source from the school education and literacy department informed that the girl was undergoing counselling at the school. "She had received counselling just two days ago. According to rumours, the girl used to meet a boy from a neighbouring school. Apparently she was upset over a fight they had a few days ago. A lot of people tried to talk to her but she disclosed little," the source said.
 
 This is the second incident in 15 days when a student of KGBV has committed suicide. On January 22, a Class XI student of KGBV, Palkot (Gumla) committed suicide, allegedly because the accountant did not allow her to go home. 
 
 Last year, a girl from KGBV, Godda underwent abortion in the school premises and it was later discovered that she had a relationship with her uncle.
 
  Department secretary Aradhana Patnaik said, "KGBV is a school where most of the girls are either victims of trafficking, child marriage or child labour, for which they require special counselling."
 
 She said while the school wardens and teachers regularly counsel students, the department has come up with 'Udaan', a project to help counsel adolescent children. 
 
 "We are getting the support of an international organisation which has started training the teachers and wardens of KGBVs so that they are able to help the students overcome their psychological, emotional and physical problems, apart from academic topics," Patnaik said.
 
 She added, "Once the training is complete, our teachers will be able to counsel the children better and we are hoping that these type of incidents will stop."
