CHENNAI:   working president   on Tuesday termed as “a big joke”   chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s claim that he had signed 1,570 files since he took charge as the CM in February.

 A few days ago, Palaniswami told reporters in Salem that his government was working the way it should work and that he had signed 1,570 files thus far.
 
 In a statement, Stalin said a chief minister should file several file. "But has chief minister launched any new policy or project by signing so many files? The 1,570 files he claimed to have signed are normal files," he said.
 
 "Has the chief minister signed any file to close liquor shops? In several areas women are protesting and damaging   demanding their closure. It would have been better if he had signed files to allocate money or to launch a new policy or project," said Stalin.
 
 One of the files he has signed could be the one to change highways into corporation roads. "By signing such a file, he has gone against the Supreme Court order to state governments to close all liquor shops along the highways," he said.
