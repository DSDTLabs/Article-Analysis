JAIPUR: The newly appointed   coordination committee for upcoming state elections held its first meeting at the party headquarters on Wednesday. 

 The state unit organised a felicitation programme too for its newly elected MPs Raghu Sharma (Ajmer) and Karan Singh Yadav (Alwar) and MLA Vivek Dhakar (Mandalgarh) on the occasion. Earlier in the day, speaker Kailash Meghwal and parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore congratulated the Ajmer MP when he was seated in a house gallery.
 
 In the coordination committee meeting, AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande reiterated that the upcoming assembly elections would be contested under the party’s joint leadership in the state. Sources said an AICC secretary, who was part of the meeting, told the state leaders to concentrate on winning the elections rather than thinking about who would be the next chief minister. Individual suggestions given by the coordination committee members would be sent to the party high command.
 
 At the felicitation programme, former chief minister   asked the party leaders to self-finance their election expenditures instead of seeking funds from the AICC, said sources. Gehlot said the party workers to make donations to AICC and PCC and asked the MPs, MLAs and elected representatives to make donations as per the Manmohan Singh committee recommendations.
 
 PCC chief   said Congress defeated   in straight fights in bypolls held on 20 assembly seats in past four years. Pilot said the big margins with which Congress won the bypolls shows that BJP, which boasts of being the world’s largest political party, would soon see its farewell from the state and the country. Leader of opposition Rameshwar Dudi said the joint leadership of state Congress was the architect of party’s excellent victory in the recently held bypolls on three seats.
