PATNA: Bihar followed suit within a few hours of the   and Highways notifying the ban on using beacons atop government vehicles on Monday. 

 The state transport department notification would result in removal of beacons atop more than 400 vehicles in Bihar.
 
 Now, beacons can be used by law enforcement agencies, emergency vehicles and those at airports, ports, mines and project sites. The amendment to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules seized the state governments’ power to issue notifications for use of red or blue  .
 
 However, the move hurt several ministers and MLAs who questioned the usefulness of doing away with ‘lal battis’.
 
 Maner RJD MLA Bhai Virendra, who till Monday had not parted with the red beacon, said, “The practice of Prime Minister and chief minsters moving with carcade should also be done away with as it’s wastage of public money. Traffic should also not be blocked for the VVIP movement as it causes inconvenience to the people. Banning beacon light is just to mislead people and the central government has done it to gain cheap publicity.”
 
 State education minister and   chief Ashok Kumar Choudhary told newsmen the practice of blocking traffic for PM and CMs’ movement should be stopped first.
 
 RJD MLA and minority welfare minister   termed the ban as useless. “Instead, the central government should focus on people’s welfare,” he said.
 
 JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Bihar CM   has not been using beacon for the past 11 years. “The step to part with red beacons is good, but the central government should have contacted every state before taking the decision as transport is also a state issue,” he said.
 
 He, however, differed with his alliance partners on traffic issue during PM or CMs’ movement as it is a security-related issue and any decision in this regard should be taken only after due discussion.
