LUDHIANA: With 10 people from   getting arrested for allegedly smuggling drugs in Ludhiana district in the past eight months, language has become a barrier for investigators. To get past this, police have started using the services of students from these countries as translators. 

 Many students from African countries come for higher education at colleges and universities in Punjab. Jalandhar Zone inspector-general (IG) Arpit Shukla, under whose jurisdiction Ludhiana Rural range falls, said students of colleges and universities vuluntarily help them as translators. “We face problems in communicating with them during investigation, so we seek the services of students of these countries. For this, we contact college authorities, and the students join us,” IG Shukla said.
 
 Police said these students help extract information from smugglers about the source of their consignments and the consignee. They added that they had reached the masterminds of the drug trade in recent cases, with the help of such students. 
 
 A college professor, who teaches students from African countries, said some   even fooled the police by claiming they did not English even though they are countries where the language is spoken. “The cops, however, could face problems in communicating with Ugandan and Tanzanian peddlers who speak Swahili,” the professor said.
