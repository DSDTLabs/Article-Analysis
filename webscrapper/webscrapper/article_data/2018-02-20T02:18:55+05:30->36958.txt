MALDA: A 30-year-old tribal woman was reportedly gang-raped and had metal objects inserted in her private parts in South Dinajpur’s   on Sunday night. A man has been arrested in this connection.

 Sources said the woman from Dehabandh Hatpara had got married in   but was deserted within a year. Since then, she had been mentally unstable and was living on other people’s mercy. 
 
 The woman is believed to have been picked up by some miscreants on Sunday evening while attending a function at a neighbouring village beside river Srimati. Residents found her under a bridge on Monday morning after which officers from   police station rescued her. 
 
 She was taken to Raiganj hospital, where doctors found traces of metallic objects in her private parts and concluded that she had been raped multiple times. She was then referred to Malda Medical College Hospital.
 
 Amit Daw, the medical college vice-principal, said her condition was critical. “Her condition does not permit us immediate surgery. There is little fluid in her body. She has been administered emergency life-saving drugs. 
 
 We can only operate after she becomes stable,” Daw said.
 
 ADG (law and order) Anuj Sharma said: “On being informed, local police and tribal welfare officers attended to her and sent her to hospital for medical treatment. On the basis of the survivor’s statement, one Ramprabesh Sharma of Dehabandh has been arrested for the extremely perverted act. A case has been started and police are considering all angles. We are committed to zero-tolerance in all such cases of sexual perversion and police will take the strongest action.”
 
 The incident, which comes ahead of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s scheduled visit to the district on Wednesday, had political reverberations. Budhan Hembram of Adivasi Kalyan Mancha said: “We came to Raiganj this morning on getting the information. She was not only gang-raped, a rod was inserted in her private parts. Police are covering up the issue.”
