 Ludhiana: The civil surgeon has issued a warning letter to Bansal hospital (Haibowal Kalan) and GTB Hospital for not informing the health department about suspected cases of swine flu. 
 
 District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said, "Hospital authorities did not inform us about the suspected case of swine flu, which they are supposed to do as per the guidelines issued to them. In a suspected case also, we are required to isolate the ward so that it does not spread to any other patient.”
 
 However, authorities at both hospitals denied having received any such letter. Dr Bhushan Bansal From Bansal Hospital said, “When the patient came to me, she was suffering from chest infection and fever. When her health deteriorated, she was referred to DMC hospital. She was admitted in our hospital with a complaint of chest infection and fever.” 
 
 Dr Harish Sahgal of MS GTB Hospital said, "The hospital has not received any case of swine flu or any warning letter.” 
 
 Box: Surveillance on
 
 After a swine flu death in the city, the health department also went to Phullanwal area, near Pakhowal for surveillance. A 25-member team of the health department went to check the source of the viral infection. 
 
 District epidemiologist Dr Munir Mohammad said it is a very tense situation and they are trying to locate the source of the infection. “There are few chances of us ascertaining the source of the infection as the woman who died attended a Lohri function and we are assuming that she contracted the infection there. We are taking proper measures to control an epidemic. Awareness and education is being given to residents of the area through posters. They have been told to get in touch if someone has symptoms of swine flu,” he said.
