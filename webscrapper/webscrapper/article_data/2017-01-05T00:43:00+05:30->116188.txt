Agartala: Stung by the arrest of two of its MPs in the   chit fund scam, Trinamool Congress ( ) on Wednesday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of shielding the Left Front government in   from a CBI probe for promoting non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

 Addressing the media here on Wednesday, TMC MLA Sudip Roy Barman said there was video evidence of chief minister Manik Sarkar promoting the Rose Valley group but the Centre did not take any action against him.
 
 “Instead, the CBI arrested two TMC MPs, Tapas Pal and Sudip Bandopadhyay, in an act of political vendetta orchestrated by the Centre. Both MPs were arrested at a time the TMC had launched a massive protest against demonetisation,” Roy Barman alleged.
 
 He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself acknowledged complaints that Sarkar and his government had patronised Rose Valley and 141 other NBFCs in centrally sponsored projects like MGNREGA over the past two years.
 
 “On every occasion, I sought a CBI inquiry into the complaints but the Centre took no action. Sarkar and Modi are helping each other,” he said.
 
 The TMC on Wednesday held rallies across Tripura to press for a CBI probe into the involvement of the government in NBFC cases here. The protests would continue on Thursday, party president Ashis Saha said.
