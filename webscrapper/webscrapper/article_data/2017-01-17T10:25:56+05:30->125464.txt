HYDERABAD: Two   in the last 24 hours   in Ziaguda and damaged a  . Over 50 people had a miraculous escape in the second incident that happened on Monday morning. No casualties were reported in both cases.

 In Ziaguda, a short circuit triggered an inferno in the furniture godown. To make matters worse, the two fire trucks dispatched from the stations at Chandulal Baradari and Moghalpura could not navigate the narrow lanes leading to the godown.
 
 "We had to lay pipes for at least 100 feet to reach the accident site. We also had to ask the municipal corporation to send a few water tankers for assistance," district fire officer M Srinivas Reddy said. 
 
 In the second incident, the blaze erupted on the first floor of a residential apartment. "Preliminary enquiries show that the cause of the fire could have been a short circuit. We are yet to ascertain the actual cause. Fortunately, there were no casualties reported," said V Papaiah, regional fire officer.
 
 He added that there were over 50 people trapped inside the building when the fire erupted. "While some of them ran down, senior citizens in the building struggled to get out. Fortunately, there was a police constable nearby who rushed into the building and helped the residents reach safety," he said.
 
 Officials, however, admitted that the narrow lanes had hindered both the rescue operations. According to senior officials of the fire department, every time they receive an SOS call from the Old City, the first question they ask is whether the road is wide enough to allow an eight-wheeled fire tender to navigate it. In case the road is not wide enough, they send motorcycles or jeeps equipped with water tanks to douse the flames.
 
 "There have been many times when we had to send fire-fighters on motorcycles and jeeps to a mishap site. But many a time, the water-holding capacity of these vehicles are not sufficient to handle the fire," said Srinivas Reddy.
