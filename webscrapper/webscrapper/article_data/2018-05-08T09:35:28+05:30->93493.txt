CHANDIGARH: At a time when human attention span is less than that of a goldfish, how can one command attention during a presentation? On Monday, Amit Roy, honorary professor, department of physics,   ( ) discussed strategies to avoid the common flaws during a presentation and how to draw the listeners’ attention. Prof   was present at   on Monday to deliver a lecture on the topic “Do people listen to your lecture?”

 The speaker presented a 5-point formula on how to increase the attention span of the listeners during the session. The 5-point formula includes identifying, respecting, engaging the audience, providing relatable content to the audience and giving them a takeaway message.
 
 Prof Roy said studies have shown that the average attention span of the audience during a lecture does not stay more than 10 minutes. In fact, it deteriorates before rising again just before the end of the lecture.
 
 Prof Roy also stressed the importance of wearing “appropriate clothes” during a presentation so that the audience is glued to the screen. He emphasised on the use of short sentences and intelligent use of humour to engage the audience during a presentation. According to Roy, the speaker should also keep in mind the time and effectively use it. He said ideally, a speaker should take one minute per presentation and it should not exceed 45 minutes as is the case with the timetable at the educational institutes.
 
 When questioned on the content to be used to engage a diverse crowd, Roy said it’s important the speaker understands the interest of the audience and prepare the slides accordingly. “If you are giving a lecture on physics to an audience of the biology department, then you should be able to connect the common elements of both subjects,” said the professor.
