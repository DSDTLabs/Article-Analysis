KHARGONE: A day after teachers of a playschool tied hands of 18 children with a long rope during an educational tour to   in Khargone’s Nutan Nagar, district education officer ordered a probe in the matter on Saturday.

 The DEO KK Dongre told TOI, “A probe was ordered after we learnt about the matter. The playschool director has also been directed to present their report.”
 
 On Saturday, investigation team didn't find anyone at the playschool because of holiday. The team will restart its probe on Monday and on the basis of the inquiry report appropriate action will be taken, said Dongre.
 
 “I have talked to the playschool director Swapnil Tiwari. He told me that the children were tied with a rope for security purpose only and teachers didn't think about other aspect,” said DEO.
 
  Tiwari pleaded that teachers took the children to the vegetable market to teach them about vegetables and fruits practically and because of their safety and in fear of missing them they tied their hands with a rope as a precautionary measure. There was no bad intention in the act, he said. 
 
 Locals have demanded action against the school as they felt the act horrific and inhuman. Photographs related to the incident have also gone viral on social media.
