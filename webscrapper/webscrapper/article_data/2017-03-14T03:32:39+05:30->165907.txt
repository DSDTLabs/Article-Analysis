 Around 12.30pm, locals heard a gunshot and when they rushed out to check what had happened, they saw the youth, who had a bullet lodged in the forehead, lying in a pool of blood. They immediately informed the Dharavi police, who rushed him to Sion hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Police said prima facie, it appears that a country-made revolver was used in the crime. None of the locals saw the attacker. 
 
 “The murder could either be a fallout of some rivalry or business deal that went sour,” said a police officer. “It appears that the accused may have called the victim to the spot, taken his wallet and other identity documents and told him to leave but then shot him at point blank range.” 
 
 Mumbai police commissioner Datta Padsalgikar has instructed the crime branch to set up special teams to crack the case as soon as possible. 
 
 “Crime branch officials said their first priority is to identify the deceased,” said the officer.
