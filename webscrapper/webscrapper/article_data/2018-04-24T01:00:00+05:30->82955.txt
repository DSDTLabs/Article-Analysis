 The talk show, which sees the actor collaborating with actor-producer   for the first time, will feature celebrities from all walks of life, including Bollywood, TV and sports.

 As of now, Rajeev is busy prepping for his turn as the host, reading up and researching on the celebrities who will feature on the show. He says, “This show requires a great amount of research, as we want to bring to the fore the real and humane side of our guests, something that the audience isn’t exposed to. I am both excited and nervous, as there is no template to follow while hosting this kind of a show. I will have to play it by ear as I sit across the guest.”
 
 Ask him about the celebs who will be appearing on the show and he replies, “I can’t reveal too much at this stage.”
