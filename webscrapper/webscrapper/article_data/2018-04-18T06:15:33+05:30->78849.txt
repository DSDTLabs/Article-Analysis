NEW DELHI: The race for control of   intensified on Tuesday with China’s   Health Holdings submitting an unsolicited non-binding expression of interest.

 The company, a subsidiary of  , that is listed on the  , has proposed primary infusion at a price up to Rs 156 a share with total investment of $350 million (around Rs 2,300 crore), including a preliminary investment of up to Rs 100 core over the next 45 days, Fortis informed stock exchanges late Tuesday evening. Fosun has proposed an exclusivity agreement for one month and the details will be worked out following due diligence, the company said.
 
 Fosun is the latest to join the fray with Manipal-TPG, Malaysian healthcare group IHH and a consortium comprising   and Burmans of Dabur evincing interest in the hospital chain set up by the Singh brothers, Malvinder and Shivinder, who have seen their shareholding nearly vanish.
 
 Fortis has, however, rejected IHH’s offer of Rs 160 for each share, citing a binding agreement with Manipal-TPG, prompting the Malaysian group to consider a hostile bid. Fortis board is due to meet on Thursday to look at the offers made so far.
 
 Fosun has been seeking to enhance its India play. Last year, it acquired 74% stake in   for $1.1 billion in what was seen as a controversial deal, which was initially blocked by the government. The deal, however, went through after the Chinese company decided to cut its share acquisition target from 86% to take advantage of a government rule that allowed acquisitions of up to 74% stake through the automatic route.
 
 As part of the India focus, Fosun is also looking to invest in start-ups and had pumped money into ixigo, a travel search app.
