ROHTAK: While Haryana chief minister   was delivering speech on   theft to residents of   on Saturday, the tent erected for his own programme was allegedly   from a transformer. 

 Mokhra residents said it was a cruel joke on them as they were accused of power theft despite having paid their bills regularly while the chief minister’s own officials were engaged in illegal activities under his nose. Keeping the hot conditions in mind, the organizers had arranged an air-conditioner and coolers for the stage on which chief minister was to sit. 
 
 On being contacted, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited superintendent engineer S K Bansal said the department had arranged generators for the CM’s function. “All the electrical equipments were running on generators,” he added. Regarding the power theft, Bansal said it was found that the owner of the tent house had made a temporary arrangement from a nearby electricity pole illegally. A theft case has been registered against the owner of tent house, he added.
 
 When officials were told about the stolen power for the event, they denied knowledge of of any such incident. After visuals of a wire hanging from an electricity pole near the tent of the chief minister surfaced, the officials shifted the blame to the tent house owner.
