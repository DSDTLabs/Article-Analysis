A special   court in Ranchi is likely to pronounce on Wednesday the judgment in one of the three remaining fodder scam cases involving   chief Lalu Prasad. 

 Lalu and 55 others will stand before the court of special CBI judge S S Prasad, as he delivers the judgment in a case pertaining to the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 37 crore from the   district treasury in the 1990s.
