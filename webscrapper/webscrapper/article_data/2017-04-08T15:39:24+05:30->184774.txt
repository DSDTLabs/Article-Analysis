INDORE: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Friday discharged BJP MLA   from the Sugnidevi land scam and also directed the lower court to reconsider the charges pressed against the 17 other accused. A division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice   granted this relief to   while disposing the criminal revision petition filed by him.

 “The court observed that there is no iota of evidence to prove that he has obtained any kind of personal benefit or any kind of personal gain from the transaction. We have also told the court that no allegations had been made personally against Ramesh Mendola and that as the president of the Nandanagar housing society, Mendola had the right to obtain the lease of the land from   as the lease was a transferable one,” advocate Veer Kumar Jain, counsel representing Ramesh Mendola said.
 
 The final order in the revision petition ran up to 49 pages, in which the court has accepted the averments made by Mendola. “I am happy that the court took note of the fact that the land was not taken for any personal gains or benefits,” Mendola told TOI. The controversy dates back to 2010 when congress leader Suresh Seth had alleged that the IMC had given the land on 30-year lease (1980-2010) to  , but the land was transferred to Nanda Nagar housing society without permission from the government. Also, the land was valued below market price causing a loss of Rs. 100 crore to the exchequer, Seth alleged.
 
 “The land near Sugnidevi College was taken for welfare purpose to build a school for the children belonging to weaker sections of the society and a hospital. It was a charitable cause. Moreover, it was a decision of the Nandanagar housing society and not a decision by Ramesh Mendola in personal capacity,” Mendola told TOI.
