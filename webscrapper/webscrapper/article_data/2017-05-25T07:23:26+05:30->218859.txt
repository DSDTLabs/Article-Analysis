PUNE: The civic administration on Wednesday tabled the comprehensive long- and short-term plans to tackle the city’s   before mayor  , prompting the residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi to tread a   path on the  .

 The   on Wednesday said they would not give their nod to the civic body’s plan blindly because there was no surety on how many proposals it would implement in a time-bound manner. They would table their suggestions before chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and seek his assurance.
 
 The comprehensive garbage plan was in the making over the past two weeks.
 
 Bhagwan Bhadale, the head of Kachara Depot Hatao Samiti, said the villagers in Uruli Devachi were yet to receive the plan. “We are firm on the stand that the garbage depot should be shifted. There is no point discussing the solutions since everyone knows that the city is not capable of processing its garbage within its area. We have tabled our demands before the CM and only he will address them. The civic administration has not done anything till now to resolve the issue,” Bhadale said.
 
 He said June 7 was the deadline for the government and the civic administration to come out with the solutions. The villagers would be ready with the further action plan thereafter, Bhadale added.
 
 Raju Bhadale, another villager, said the civic administration was supposed to call a meeting with the villagers. “Our demands are clear. We want permanent jobs for 62 villagers in PMC. Besides, the CM has assured that our land would be returned,” he said.
 
 Tilak said her office had received the plan. “I shall study it in the next couple of days, after which I will approach the political party leaders and hold a meeting with the villagers too. There is a plan to include suggestions from civic organizations as well. The plan will then go to the CM. The process will be completed before June 7,” Tilak said.
