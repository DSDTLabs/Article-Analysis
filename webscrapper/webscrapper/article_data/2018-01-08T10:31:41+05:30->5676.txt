MUMBAI: A fire erupted on the third floor of the sessions court building on Monday morning. 

 The fire broke out at 7am in the session's court, which is located near the Mumbai University campus in south Mumbai. Four fire engines and water tankers along with an ambulance were immediately rushed to the spot.

 Local Shiv Sena corporator Sujata Sanap said that since it was dark as electrictrical equipment were switched off, fire fighting was a challenge for fire officials. "However they were trying hard to ensure that none of the documents were damaged in the fire. Wooden furniture in the room as well as the roof have been damaged," she said. 
 
 The fire has been brought under control now. Civic officials said the reason of the blaze appears to be the ongoing wielding work being done on the premises by the PWD.
