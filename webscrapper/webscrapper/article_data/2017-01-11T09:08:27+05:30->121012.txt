KOCHI:   chairman of   Harris PH has written to the corporation secretary to hand over all files related to the permission given to various telecom service providers to dig up roads. 

 In the wake of allegations, such files should be verified in detail and appropriate action including a vigilance inquiry in to the cases has to be taken in consultation with the corporation council or as per municipal rules. "In the meantime, being the chairman of work standing committee, I would like to see all the files which gave sanction to Reliance Infocomm \ Jio, Tata and Airtel in the past," said the letter given to corporation secretary.
 
 He said a file was opened on the basis of an application for digging up roads submitted by   a few months ago and when it came up for consideration of steering committee on November 9, 2016, Harris as well as health standing committee chairperson V K Minimol wanted to see the file related to it before giving the nod.
 
 "However, this file has to be seen by me and works standing committee members to avoid confusions and allegations in the future," Harris said in his letter. He also requested to avoid unnecessary delays in clearing files. "There are allegations that the files are being delayed for bargaining and fixing deals with the private firms. No files should be delayed unless there is sufficient reasons for doing withholding them. If there is any problem in clearing a file that also should be noted in the file. This for bringing in transparency," Harris said.
