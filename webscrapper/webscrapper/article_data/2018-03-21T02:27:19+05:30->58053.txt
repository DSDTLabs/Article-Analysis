NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday for the first time found an unlikely ally in   which expressed solidarity with them demanding the arrest of JNU professor  , who is accused of sexual harassment.

 While protesting outside the Vasant Kunj police station, the organisations, which included All India Democratic Women’s Association, All India Progressive Women’s Association, and students’ groups like SFI and AISA, also accused police of conniving with Johri and criticised them for “inordinate delay” in the probe. A delegation led by P K Sreemathi, a CPM MP, also met the police.
 
 Students of SLS, however, claimed that they were unaware of protests by ABVP. “All protests were called by the school students. ABVP has been supporting us from outside,” said one of them.
 
 ABVP, meanwhile, claimed that   of the   were their   and demanded a speedy trial in the case.
 
 In a joint statement, the women’s organisation said, “The harassment of girl students in JNU is highly condemnable and shameful. Nine students from Johri’s laboratory have registered a police complaint against him.” They also raised concerns over the professor still occupying some important administrative positions, like the wardenship of Chandrabhaga Hostel, and claimed that Johri is likely to use his clout to influence the probe. “Pressure is already being exerted on the girls to withdraw the complaint,” they claimed.
 
 The bodies demanded that the JNU administration must immediately suspend Johri and bar him from supervising students till the investigation is completed.
 
 ABVP protested at School of Life Sciences , the centre where Johri is a professor. It also demanded that the complainants “be provided unhindered laboratory access and it should be ensured that their research continue unabated.” They also sought immediate suspension of Johri, all professors, teachers and students against whom cases of sexual harassment are pending.
