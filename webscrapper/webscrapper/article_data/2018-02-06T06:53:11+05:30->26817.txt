CHANDIGARH:   Captain   on Monday urged all ministers and MLAs in the state to pay their   themselves rather than depending on the government.

 The CM was informed during a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on fiscal management on Monday that Punjab was possibly the only state in the country where the government was paying income-tax of all the MLAs. The state government spends Rs 11.08 crore annually to pay income-tax of the 117 MLAs, including ministers.
  
  
 The income-tax paid for each legislator by the Punjab government is around Rs 9.5 lakhs. An MLA in Punjab draws Rs 84,000 monthly salary and Rs 30,000 as petrol/diesel monthly reimbursement apart from travel and dearness allowances.
 
 The chief minister said the state government was facing unnecessary burden by paying income-tax for its legislators. In case his suggestion is implemented, Amarinder said it would result in savings which could then be diverted for important development work and for implementation of welfare schemes. The chief minister again urged his party colleagues and rich farmers to give up free power subsidy and contribute to ending financial deficit faced by the state.
 
 In June last year, Amarinder had announced that he had given up the electricity subsidy and had appealed to all the legislators to do the same.
