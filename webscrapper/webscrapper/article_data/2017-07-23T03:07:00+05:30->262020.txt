Panaji: A group of social activists, who are fighting against the construction of a new airport at Mopa, has alleged that the government has signed a one-sided agreement with GMR Airports Ltd which benefits the company even if the project is terminated, leaving the people of Goa to pay for it. Goans for Dabolim Only (GFDO) claimed the Mopa airport is an unviable project that goes against the interests of the people of Goa. “The government is flouting its own concessionaire agreement to breathe life into this unviable project,” it stated. The state government has agreed to give 381 acres of land to the concessionaire, of which 240 acres is for unrestricted development, the group said, pointing out that without a timeline for developing the 381 acres, the land will not benefit the Goans, only allowing GMR to hold on to the land resources by keeping them vacant until the land prices escalate. “The agreement also shockingly states that the government need not take back the 381 acres until the year 2076 in case the agreement is terminated,” said GFDO convener Eremito Rebelo at a press meet on Saturday. According to the agreement, if the government does not give GMR the ‘right of way’ (road access from the highway to the airport) within six months, the government is liable to pay the concessionaire Rs 3.60 lakh per day of Goan taxpayers’ money if there is a delay in the project on its part, presumably as penalty. “Has the right of way been handed over to GMR? If not, what is the reason and penalty for the delay?” he asked. Several months after the agreement was signed and despite Rs 1,500 crore being sanctioned for the project, there is still no master plan for the airport, Rebelo said.  CM Manohar Parrikar hasn’t granted GFDO an appointment to clarify its doubts on the project, he added.
