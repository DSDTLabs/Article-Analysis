AHMEDABAD: The state government has approved 6,850 posts for filling in various cadres at the government-aided   in the state. These posts are in secondary and higher secondary schools.

 These posts were vacant for seven years and   had been shelved by the government. Several representations from various associations of schools were made, asking the government to sanction these posts and allow schools to make appointments. The management stated that because of the lack of these approvals, teaching at several schools was suffering, while several schools did not even have full-time principals.
 
 Among the 6,850-post approved, 1,566 posts are for principals, another 2.915 post are for secondary teachers on contract, while another 2,369 posts were for higher secondary teachers on contract.
 
 There are around 3,000-odd posts that have not been approved by the government. The government will now give no-objection certificates to these schools to invite applications for the approved posts. Officials said that during the appointment process, these schools will also have to have a representative of the state government on the board.
