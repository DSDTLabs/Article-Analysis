 HURL managing director A K Gupta called on Modi on Tuesday to discuss the current situation at HFCL. The plant will produce 3,850 tonnes of neem coated urea per day and fulfil the needs of farmers in Bihar and Jharkhand, Gupta told the deputy CM.
 
 When the Gas Authority of India Limited (HAIL) took up the Haldia-Jagdishpur natural gas pipeline project, it was felt that the three closed HFCL plants at Sindri, Barauni and Gorapkhpur should be revived to ensure bulk consumption of natural gas.
