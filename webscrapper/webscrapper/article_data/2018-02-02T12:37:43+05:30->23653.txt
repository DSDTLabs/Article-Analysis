PATNA: The district administration’s probe into the infamous dance event during Sarawati Puja celebrations at   last month has put the blame on hostel superintendent D N Sinha and warden   for their failure to inspect the programme when it was going on.

 Patna DM   on Thursday sent a copy of the probe report to the college administration for action. The DM has also written to the SSP to take action against the policemen deployed on duty at the event for their failure to prevent the programme.
 
 The probe committee comprised SDO (sadar)   and   (town) S A Hashmi. “Their probe report says the superintendent and warden did not carry out their duty to inspect the ongoing programme,” Ravi told TOI .
 
 Sources said the college hostel’s puja committee had sought permission from the college administration to organise ‘jagran’ on the occasion. However, a video that went viral showed girls dancing in skimpy clothes on the festival night on the college premises. The video also captured the policemen enjoying the performance.
 
 Hostel superintendent Sinha is a teacher in the college’s department of English. The DM said Sinha’s residential quarter was only 300metres away from the ‘jagran’ venue. “That he remained unaware of the dance show is not possible,” the DM said and added the probe report also noted the absence of any gatekeeper at the college gate.
 
 The Patna DM has also asked for a copy of the report of the college’s internal inquiry committee on the issue.
