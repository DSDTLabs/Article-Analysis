AHMEDABAD: Kamlesh   (21) got bail in connection with a rape case after his DNA sample did not match with the child born to the alleged rape survivor.

 Gujarat high court has granted him conditional bail, but a lower court had denied to release him though he submitted that the DNA test proved that the child born to the survivor was not fathered by him. He also argued that he was arrested because of mistaken identity. His surname is Ganaga and the name of the accused mentioned in the FIR was Kamlesh Katara.
 
 According to case details, the 19-year-old survivor, who was in labour pain, was taken to the Civil Hospital on May 21 last year through 108 Emergency   called by unknown people. The girl gave birth to a stillborn child the same day. After the delivery, an FIR was registered by Naroda police in which the girl stated that she was lured to a relationship by the accused on promise of marriage.
 
 The girl further told police that when she became pregnant and insisted the boy for the marriage, he dumped her and left the city. Two months later, Ganaga was arrested. Police got DNA test report in October which revealed that Ganaga was not the father of the baby. 
 
 This led Ganaga to seek bail from the city sessions court, where his advocate B   argued that Ganaga was a victim of mistaken identity. The cops never held any Test Identification parade by presenting the accused before the girl. And the DNA analysis proved that Ganaga was not involved, the lawyer argued.
 
 However, the trial court refused bail to him and observed, “The accused had given promise to the victim and he escaped from his liability. Such type of offence could not be taken lightly and strict view should be taken against such type of accused…It is not expected at this stage to have the evidence establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.”
 
 However, the HC has now ordered release of Ganaga on bail at Rs10,000 bond.
