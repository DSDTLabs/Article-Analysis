CHENNAI: To increase awareness of water bodies, the Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) has planned an ecological safari, ‘Cyclakes’. It involves participants cycling to four city lakes each weekend.

 “This is for people who know more about the waterbodies in the city. A lake has more to it – such as the hydrology, geology, water management and the life forms supported by it. We will discuss the current day problems faced by waterbodies and the future solutions, of which each person can be a part of,” said   of EFI. He said the participants will be allowed to spend a few minutes at each of the lake, where such things will be discussed.
 
  and   lakes drain into the Pallikaranai marshland. But where does that water come from and what is the quality of that water? What role does Pallikaranai marshland play in supporting flora and fauna? These are somethings this cycle ride could help the participants learn.
 
 According to Arun, a number of volunteers come forward to clean lakes along with EFI, but such an activity will help create more awareness on the ecosystem and the importance of waterbodies. Volunteers with EFI have helped clean and restore several of these lakes in the past.
 
 “A lake is not just a water-holding area. It has components like catchment area, water running area, and a channel that helps drain the excess water from the   to the storage area – that is the lake. If the participants are aware of how the ecosystem works, they would be far more interested in helping us work for the environment,” said Arun.
 
 This event will start in eight cities across the country, starting with Chennai, on Sunday. It will begin at 7am from OMR Toll Plaza, Perungudi.
