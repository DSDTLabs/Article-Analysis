HYDERABAD: After Karnataka, Congress president   shifted his focus on strengthening the party for the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Telangana. 

 In a crucial move, backward classes leader and former MP Anjan Kumar Yadav has been appointed as the president of   Congress committee, replacing former minister Danam Nagender who headed the party in GHMC area. 
 
 While senior party leaders said that Danam Nagender would be given another important role, sources in the AICC said Danam had failed to keep the party flag high in GHMC elections. The Congress party was decimated with TRS winning 99 of the 150 seats followed by MIM in 44 seats, BJP in four, Congress two and TDP one.
 
 Also, there was a rumour that Danam was going to join the ruling TRS, which he denied. Anjan's son, Anil K Yadav is Telangana Youth Congress state president and played a role in providing security to the Karnataka Congress and JD (S) MLAs in Hyderabad.
 
 In all, 13 district congress committee presidents have been appointed including five heading the city units of districts. Except the appointment of Yadav, a majority of 12 DCC presidents are continuing in the same posts. 
 
 The appointments assumes significance ahead of AICC general secretary Ashok Gehlot's two-day visit to Hyderabad giving it a map to win the elections. He is scheduled to come on May 29. He will review the measures taken by TPCC to strengthen the 'polling booth committees'.
