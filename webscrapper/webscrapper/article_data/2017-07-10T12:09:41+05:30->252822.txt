Meerut: Meerut Municipal Corporation’s councillor Aarif (who went by his first name) was killed and his friend Shadab was critically injured after unidentified men opened fire at them when they were standing outside a mosque in Kotwali area on Sunday morning. The incident was reported around 7.45 pm and personal enmity is being suspected as the reason behind the attack. Police have started investigating and security has been beefed up across Meerut to ensure that there are no law and order-related problems.

  “Aarif, councilor of ward 66, and Shadab were talking to each other near Qureshi Wali Masjid in Kotwali area when two unidentified armed men came and opened fire at them. The attack was so sudden that the people standing close to them could not react to what had happened. Both the men were rushed to a local hospital, where Aarif died and Shadab is battling for life,” said Vijay Gupta, station house officer, Kotwali police station.
 
  Sources said that it is a matter of old enmity connected to the murder of a transgender named Shamshad almost a year ago. At that time, Aarif’s nephew Salman was said to be behind the murder.
 
  “A case has been registered in this regard and heavy force has been deployed to maintain peace in the area. Efforts are being made to arrest the accused,” said Gupta.
