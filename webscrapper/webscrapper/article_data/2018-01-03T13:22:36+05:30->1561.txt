Madurai: Thousands of people converged at the ancient Uthirakosamangai Sri Managalanathaswamy temple in   district on Monday night to witness the Arudhra dharshan of the rare six-foot-tall single stone emerald   statue in the temple, which can only be seen once a year.

 The statue of Lord Natarajar is believed to have been carved by celestial forces and is rarest of its kind. Since exposure to light and sound is said to disturb the molecular property of emerald, the statue is kept covered with sandalwood paste through the year. People visiting the temple are asked to refrain from making any noise — even the ones made by anklets — when they go near the shrine of the emerald Natarajar. The statue measures five-and-a-half feet disregarding the curved ‘Virupatchi’ or arch.
 
 The sandalwood paste is removed only on the day of ‘Thiruvadhirai’ star in the month of  , as per astrology, when devotees get a glimpse of the green statue. The special dharshan to the devotees is known as Arudhra dharshan. On Monday, the sandalwood paste was removed from the statue at 9.30 am and special abhishekams performed continuously, including throughout the night. Thousands witnessed the idol being showered with milk, scents and honey. The Arudhra dharshan was observed around 10.30 pm on Monday and the idol again covered with sandalwood paste at 2 am on Tuesday. Devotees vied with each other to get a small portion of the previous year’s sandalwood paste which was distributed to them as prasad and is said to have medicinal properties. Ramanathapuram district collector S Natarajan, superintendent of police Om  , trustee of Ramanathapuram Samasthana Devasthanam Rani Rajeswari Nachiar, among others participated in the annual ritual.
