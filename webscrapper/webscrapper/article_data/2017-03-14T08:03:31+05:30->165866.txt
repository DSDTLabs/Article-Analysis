HYDERABAD: Death came knocking at the door of 50-year-old mason Papaiah. He and his wife Kistavva, 40, joined work only on Monday morning and within a few hours tragedy struck the family. 

 Only on Sunday night did the family from Sangareddy, who were in search of work, accept the job offered by the contractor. “It’s our bad luck that we accepted the work offered by the head mason. The very first day at work turned into a major tragedy for me. My wife died after getting trapped in the debris," said Papaiah. 
 
 The family had planned a Holi party after work on Monday evening, but fate had other plans, he said. After the death of his wife, Papaiah has the sole responsibility of taking care of their three children, none of whom are married yet. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, he said he and his three children - Lakshmi, 20; Saikumar, 23; and Hanumantu, 12; moved to Masjidbanda, a slum in Kondapur. Lakshmi also works along with her parents. “Sometimes we get work at one site or we look for work at different places. A head mason approached us for work in the ill-fated building on Sunday night. We did not imagine that the job offer would take my wife away from all of us for ever,” he said with tears in his eyes.
 
 Lakshmi was lucky as she did not accompany her parents.“We sent her on a different work at Anjayya Nagar in the city. She escaped the tragedy,” he said. 
 
 Lakshmi was in state of shock after she learnt that her mother had died. “We did not celebrate Holi on Sunday. My mother woke us up in the morning. She told us that we would celebrate Holi after returning from work in the evening. She said she would cook special dishes,” she said.
 
 Another  , Bharatamma, 23, who also died in the incident, had gotten married only recently. She along with her husband Balaraj, 26, moved to the city in search of work from Kamareddy district.
