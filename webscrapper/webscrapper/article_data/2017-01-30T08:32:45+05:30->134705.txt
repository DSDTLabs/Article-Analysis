NEW DELHI: In a suspected case of revenge killing, a 75-year-old man, father of dreaded gangster  , was gunned down by five men outside his house in outer Delhi’s   on Sunday morning.

 The assailants arrived in a Scorpio car and waited for Shri Kishan to step out of the house. They fired multiple shots at him at close range, police said. Kishan was hit on his head and face. Police suspect the role of hired killers from Uttar Pradesh in the murder and are scanning   for leads.
 
 Sanjay, the victim’s younger son, told TOI: “My parents lived on their own in the house. My father was attacked when he came out to buy vegetables in the morning.” Raj Kumar, a local, said he had no idea of what actually happened. “We got to know about the incident only around 11.30am. We rushed to the spot and found Kishan lying in a pool of blood outside his house.”
 
 Kumar claimed that while some people had gathered at the spot, no one came forward to help the victim. “They said a few men came in a Scorpio car, shot Kishan and fled,” he added.
 
 One of passers-by called the police and Kishan was taken to Rao Tula Ram hospital where he was declared “brought dead”. Doctors said there were at least five bullet marks on the victim’s body.
 
 There were three CCTV cameras on the front side of the house. Police said they were scanning the footage to join the dots. “We are investigating the case and are trying to track the Scorpio car, which has a Haryana registration number. Some eyewitnesses are being questioned in the matter,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Police sources said the shooters could be contract killers hired by a rival gang member to eliminate Kishan, who has been a target since the murder of Sunil Doctor, one of their associates. Though the area DCP could not be contacted, sources said police were yet to identify any of the accused in the case. Locals claimed that there had been a spurt in gang-related violence in the past one month.
