PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Hinjewadi gram panchayat has urged the   to start clearing   as soon as possible. Heaps of waste have been piling up at various places in Hinjewadi village after the contractor stopped his work for the last three days, posing a health hazard to local residents.

 Digvijay Hulawale, former general secretary, Pune district unit of National Students Union of India and a local resident, said, “Ghantagadis are not collecting household garbage due to which garbage is lying in homes. People cannot store garbage for so long in their houses so they are throwing plastic carry bags containing garbage along roads and wherever they find open spaces. As a result heaps of garbage can be found at many places in the village.”
 
 Vasant Sakhare, former director, Sant Tukaram sugar factory, said, “People are facing problems due to non-collection of garbage. The garbage dumped along the roads is rotting and emanating   This may pose danger to the health of residents if the garbage is not lifted quickly.
