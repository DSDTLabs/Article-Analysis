 Heightened spiritualism marked the celebrations as the young and the old alike worshipped Jhulelal and Guru Granth Sahib before exchanging greetings. Located off Marquis Street, the only temple in Kolkata for the 1,900 Sindhi families in town, turned into the centre of festivities. The celebrations that started last Sunday ended on Wednesday with prayers and feasting on the special prasad.
 
 After losing Sindh to Pakistan during Partition, jewellers Mehtanis were the first Sindhis to make Kolkata their home. “We are Hindus, but we also believe in Sikhism,“ said Nanik Sambtani, one of the oldest members. Chetti Chand starts with the families carrying out Bahrana Sahib at home. “It's the lighting of a five-pointed diya made of atta on a thali with fruits, rice and sweets,“ Sambtani said.
 
 At the temple, the members help prepare the elaborate prasad. The traditional feast comprises tairi (sweet ri ce), pulao, sai bhaji (spinach with chana dal) and alu tuk (deep fried potatoes). “Though most Sindhis love non-vegetarian food, we eat veg on Chetti Chand,“ said Murli Punjabi, secretary of Sindhi Panchayat, a social organization. While Reshmi Ardasani, Reshma Chenani, Murli Keswani, Suresh Gehani worked at a feverish pitch, preparing the prasad and packaging it, shehnai dularis from Rajasthan played traditional tunes.
