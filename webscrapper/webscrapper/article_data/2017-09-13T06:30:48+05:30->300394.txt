KOCHI: Growth of startup   in   seems to be prompting a reverse brain drain. Prasad Pillai, the co-founder of  , returned to Kerala leaving his job with Microsoft in the US to develop a smart car device named SafeDrive.
“Fundamentally , I wanted to participate in the growth of India, because there are very big changes happening in the country , right now,“ said Pillai. A graduate of Government Engineering College,  , he had reached the US within one year of finishing his course. Initially employed with Nuphoton and later with Toro, he left the US in 2013.
 
 What prompted him to develop a device that is beneficial to a car driver in the event of an accident is his own experience. “A relative of mine had died in an accident. And I also had met with two accidents ­ one each in India and the US,“ he said.
 
 According to Pillai, the trauma that follows the accident is quite unbearable.“Here, in India, you might even pick up a fight with the driver of the other vehicle, which is involved in the collision,“ he said. Thoughts of easing the stress of the accident led him to develop a device that could alert a command centre, which will receive the location of the accident at the touch of a button.
 
 “If you need medical assistance, just press that particular button and we will direct the nearest available ambulance to your rescue,“ he said.
 
 The device also offers roadside assistance and vehicle tracking. “It could also give you tips on improving the driving habits of the driver. If you are prone to slamming your brakes quite often, the device will notice that and will suggest improvements,“ he said.
