TIRUNELVELI: The Central Crime Branch ( ) of the Tirunelveli city police has arrested the gold appraiser of a nationalised bank on charges of cheating the bank by recommending the sanctioning of Rs 95 lakh for jewellery that was no match to the value.

Some of them even did not respond to the auction notice served to them. It is then the bank authorities conducted an audit to check the quality of the pledged jewellery. They found that the jewellery was of inferior quality or not gold as well, following which the manager Selvaraj lodged a complaint with the CCB on Friday.
 
 After inquiry, police registered a case against Shenbagaraj under Sections 417 (punishment for cheating), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to a person whose interest offender is bound to protect) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code.
