AHMEDABAD: To find solutions to pressing   such as  ,   and relations and better understanding of signal reflections off the oceans, a group of 12 students at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) participated in a 96-hour competition , the Mathematical Contest in Modelling (MCM) 2018, organized by the Consortium of Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP) at the institute. The contest, held globally every year, is aimed at finding solutions to pressing issues and the students are working towards different solutions in groups of three.

 The issues that IIT-Gn students have been working on include ‘Multi-hop HF Radio Propagation’ (students will develop a mathematical model for signal reflection off the ocean), ‘How Many Languages?’ (improving global tourism and interpretation of international relations, by studying more than 6,900 languages) and ‘Energy Production’ (developing a set of goals for interstate energy compacts after profiling four states for consumption of energy).
 
 Faculty advisor to the teams, Professor Raj Srinivasan, said, “At the end of these rigorous 96 hours, the world will have surprising and novel solutions to these crucial problems. The solutions will be guiding principles for policymaking in their respective areas in the coming years.”
 
 The results of the competition are expected to be announced in April 2018.
