KOLKATA: In a shocking incident of 'moral policing', a young couple travelling on the Kolkata   were reportedly harassed and thrashed by some of their co-passengers for "being too close" after they boarded a train late on Monday night. 

 
  It all began after some elderly co-passengers objected to their " ", leading to a heated argument. 
 
  The young couple was reportedly bombarded with embarrassing questions followed by punches, kicks and slaps inside a station once they deboarded the train. 
 
 
 
 
  "Unfortunately, no complaint has been lodged as yet and this makes it very difficult to conduct an inquiry,"   CPRO Indrani Banerjee said, adding that the Metro was "against moral policing". 
 
  The CCTV footage in the station did not record any incident of an assault, she claimed, though videos of the thrashing, which were shot by eyewitnesses, have since gone viral all over the social media. 
 
  Protests were held outside the   station on Tuesday against the incident. "A young couple embraced in Kolkata Metro. It made a bunch of frustrated old losers angry. They beat them up. Scenes of hatred are allowed. Scenes of love are considered obscene," writer   tweeted.
