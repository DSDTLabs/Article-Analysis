Jaipur: Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has constituted a three-member committee to keep a watch on the activities of the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya after around 12 parents filed a complaint of harassment against the school administration.

 S P Singh, Seema Joshi and Jayshree Garg will be the members of the committee who will look after the school for three months and if required then this time period will be extended. The committee will also have the support of Child Welfare Committee and education department for the matter.
 
 Seema Joshi, the member of the committee told TOI, “Our priority is benefit of the children and we will take all the necessary steps. The school has not provided us the exam copies of the daughter of Sippi Mahendra, who was the first person to file a complaint against the teachers. When we summoned the teachers, they told us that they have shown exam copies to the girl, but the student denied it. So, this matter is serious and the school is behaving in an irresponsible way. On Tuesday we will take further decision against this.”
 
 Krishna Bhati, the principal of the school said that this is a step towards amelioration and the school needs to remain aligned with child welfare. “However, as a key stakeholder and custodian of children’s welfare, I am also awaiting the outcome/conclusion of the probe regarding children’s matters. If there are defaulters, then they need to be held accountable,” said Bhati.
