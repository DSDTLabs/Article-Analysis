CHENNAI: Announcing that new smart cards for government school students are on the anvil, the minister for school education, sports and youth welfare K A Sengottaiyan said the government will soon introduce the cards in the state schools. 

 Sengottaiyan said the cards will eliminate the need for any further identification cards for the lakhs of government school students and will be used to store vital information about the students -- photographs, blood group, address, family details and Aadhaar details.
 
 Besides serving as a mode of identification for students, the smart cards, Sengottaiyan said, is a step towards the digital era in education. The card will contain details of the school the student is attending including number of teachers, facilities available, and number of students. The smart card will also be able to track the academic performances and grades of the student.
