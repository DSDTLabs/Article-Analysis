VISAKHAPATNAM: Apathy of the   and the people’s representatives has resulted in Vizag district not only losing the regional sports school but also two more  . 

 After losing out on the regional sports school due to infighting between two  , the district has now lost a   and a synthetic athletic track to Vizianagaram. 
 
 Sources said the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) had planned to set up a water sports academy in Vizag as it has a vast coastline. The proposed project was planned at Rushikonda beach. Meanwhile, Union minister for civil aviation P Ashok Gajapati Raju took the initiative and directed the Rs 3 crore project on water sport academy to be set up at Thatipudi reservoir area. 
 
 “The district authorities got the administrative sanction for the academy, which will be set up on a five acre land close to the reservoir,” a senior official of the Vizianagaram district told TOI. 
 
 As Thatipudi reservoir comes under the supervision of the irrigation department, the district authorities have written to the irrigation department superintendent for the land parcel. Once the land gets allotted, the district would get funds for the equipment and the academy would come up in six months, sources said. 
 
 When contacted, Vizianagaram district sports development officer (DSDO) N Surya Rao said around 50 players would be accommodated in the academy. Waters sports like kayaking, canoeing (boats) and others would be taught there. He said the government has released a GO on March 1 in this regard. 
 
 A technical team is to visit Viziangaram for selecting players once the equipment is ready for the academy.
