GUWAHATI: Chief minister   on Sunday asked for a survey to be carried out across   to find out the number of children in the state who are hearing impaired. Sonowal was at an event of the   project where he distributed custom-made hearing aid devices to 110 children with   from poor families. 

 The Mission Shravan project is a joint effort by the National Health Mission, the UK-based NGO Ideal Charity and the IAS Officers' Wives Association, Prerana, to provide devices to children with hearing impairment.
 
 "I ask people associated with the Mission Shravan project to initiate a survey to see how many such children are there in the state. We can start a journey and come up with ways to help the children. It is our ideal and basic duty as human beings to help others. We should strive ahead to ensure that the lives of such children are made comfortable," said Sonowal. 
 
 This was the second distribution ceremony of custom-made hearing aid devices. More than 400 children from poor families were screened for hearing impairment at Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital under the same project.
