VADODARA: She drew a girl sitting in a room and reading a book. When asked, she said that she missed her daughter and drew her as preparing for board exams. This is what an under-trial lodged in   told during an art workshop held in the jail on the occasion of International Women’s Day.
City-based   has organized a week-long art therapy workshop for female inmates of Vadodara Central Jail from Wednesday. They were asked by the workshop conductors to draw something on the theme of ‘house’. “These inmates go through a lot mentally during their time in jail therefore through this workshop we want to help them to shell out their frustration in art,” said  , director of the gallery. Around 25 female inmates participated in the workshop on the first day.   added that on Wednesday they gave sketch books to the prisoners and had an ice-breaking session. “Initially the prisoners were hesitant to draw but, we asked them to start drawing with objects that they see around after which they started to draw,” said Rana.
 
 From Thursday, the participants will make their art work on canvas. “We have asked them to make something in the sketch book on the theme. Tomorrow I will take 25 easels so that they can make their works according to the training,” Rana added. On Wednesday, the ice breaking session was also attended by inspector general (Prisons) T S Bisht. Bisht told TOI: “It is an interesting initiative because the inmates will be able to explore their creativity and can take up art as profession after they are out of jail.
 Rana had organized a similar workshop for male inmates in 2011.
