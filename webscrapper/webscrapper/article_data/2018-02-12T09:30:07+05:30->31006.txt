PANAJI: If a female MP laughs in Parliament, it is being seen as unwanted behaviour. A layman can harbour such perceptions, but this is not expected of law-makers sitting in the Parliament, Congress MP   said in Goa on Sunday. She was reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Ramayana’ jibe at Chowdhury earlier this month in the  . 

 “Earlier, the land laws favoured men. The laws were later changed, but the perception they created about women remained. Even if a woman laughs in Parliament today it is seen as being unbecoming of her. Some men have this perception of women, but men who make laws in Parliament cannot have such perceptions. They are expected to give the country direction with their status. If they continue to behave in this manner, how many years will it take us to give the girl child and females the equality they deserve,” said Chowdhury at the international conference on gender inequality, ‘Difficult Dialogues’, hosted in Goa. She later told reporters that she did not require permission to laugh ‘after being a five-time MP’.
 
 Modi had taken a dig at Chowdhury in the Rajya Sabha saying that her laughter reminded him of the 1980s television programme ‘Ramayana’. 
 
 While speaking as part of the panel on Sunday, Chowdhury also said that society should learn to stop treating women only as extensions of their fathers or brothers. “Women are not striving to the equal, we are equal, if not better,” she said. Chowdhury added that the protests by   against the film Padmaavat stemmed from a patriarchal mindset. “They protested not even knowing what is in the film, without even having watched it,” she said.
