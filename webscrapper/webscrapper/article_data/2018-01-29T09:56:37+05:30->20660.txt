MADURAI:   godman, Sadagopa Ramanuja Jeeyar, head of Sri Manavala Mamunigal Mutt at Srivilliputhur, stated that he had asked pardon from   over his recent remarks on throwing soda bottles or pelting stones. The godman made these comments while addressing a meeting organised by   outfit at   on Friday.

 The comments were made over a controversy over Tamil lyricist   referring Hindu deity Aandal as Devadasi in an essay he wrote in a vernacular daily. Ever since, there are protests in Srivilliputhur and other places demanding Vairamuthu to express a public apology and seek pardon from the deity on or before February 3, failing which the seer has threatened to go on indefinite hunger strike. The seer was addressing a meeting in this regard at Tiruchengode urging members of all Hindu outfits to protest against Vairamuthu and uttered that ‘we all know how to hurl soda bottles and stones’.
 
 The comments became viral on social media and attracted criticism across the sections. Under these circumstances, the seer told media persons on Sunday that the comments were a reaction to threats they were receiving over phone and letters. Their objective is to protest in a peaceful manner. “For my words, I had sought pardon from Sri Aandal Nachiar, the mother. In the same manner, the Hindu people feel that a Jeeyar shouldn’t have spoken in that manner. For that too, I had sought pardon from the deity”, the seer told media persons.
 
 Meanwhile, police protection has been deployed at Srivilliputhur Mutt inside Srivilliputhur temple premises. An investigation is underway over the threat letters and calls after a complaint has been lodged by the seer. Starting from Sunday, people entering the mutt premises are screened by the police.
