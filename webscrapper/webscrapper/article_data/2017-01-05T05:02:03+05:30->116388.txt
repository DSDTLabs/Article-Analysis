NEW DELHI: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee escalated the pitch of her battle against the Centre’s   move on Wednesday by bringing it to the doorstep of PM Modi. 

 As many as 36 Trinamool MPs staged a march to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, saying the arrest of its MPs by the CBI for their alleged involvement in chit fund scams was the Centre’s “vendetta politics”. Meanwhile Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra walked out of a pre-Budget meeting with Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, citing a “financial and political emergency”.
 
 The MPs were detained by Delhi Police before they could reach the PM’s residence, but the twopronged protest ensured that TMC’s agitation was visible on the national stage. “We were marching peacefully towards the PM’s residence, but police detained us mid-way and manhandled a few of our MPs,” TMC’s Saugata Roy told reporters. He said they would continue to raise their voice against the “injustice done by the Modi government”. Police, however, said the MPs were released after a brief detention. 
 
 With TMC trying to lead the anti-demonetisation agitation against the Centre and the government retaliating with equal fervour, Banerjee’s clear attempt is to reap political benefit as a “victim” and also to drive home the message that TMC has the support of people. Banerjee has accused the PM of using central agencies like the CBI against political rivals raising their voice against demonetisation.
