Viewers are in for a double treat as two new fiction shows — ' ' and 'Savitri Devi College & Hospital' — will go on air from today. While the former will air at 5.30 pm, the latter will be telecast at 6 pm, every Monday to Friday, on Colors. For most men, one marriage is good to last a lifetime, but the situational comedy 'Bhaag Bakool Bhaag' showcases the life of Bakool ( ), who shuttles between two wives — Jigna (Shruti Rawat) and Sheena (Hiba Nawab), ensuring each is leading a happy life. 
On the other hand, 'Savitri Devi College & Hospital' is a medical drama that revolves around the life of a young medical intern, Saachi Mishra ( ), who strives to fulfil her mother Jaya’s (Shilpa Shirodkar) dream of becoming a doctor. Speaking about his role in 'Bhaag Bakool Bhaag', Jay says, “Versatility is very critical for an actor, and I’ve always believed in experimenting with genres and characters. Bakool’s dilemma is simple; he has two wives, both very different, and he wants to keep them both happy. And strangely, my wife is excited to see how I am going to handle three wives — one real and two reel!” The show also features Gujarati actors Purvi Vyas and Hardik Sangani.
 
 
  
 
 Swardha, who is making her fiction debut in Hindi with 'Savitri Devi College & Hospital' on Colors, says, “I’ve done Marathi television, but being a part of Hindi show is a different ball game altogether. This show is about relationships and how several characters come together for a common motive. Like Saachi, I’m extremely close to my mother; she’s the strength that propelled my career graph into mainstream entertainment. This show is special and I hope viewers love it.” 
 The show, which will air for an hour, also features Mohan Kapur, Neha Bagga, Varun Kapoor, Vikram Sakhalkar, Jignesh Joshi and Kishwer Merchant.
