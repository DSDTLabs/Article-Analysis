CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   asked the   on Monday to take note of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind  's night stay at the residence of an alleged terrorist in Moga.

 Sukhbir said Kejriwal's night stay at the residence of Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) chief Gurinder Singh, alias  , had “vitiated poll atmosphere in Punjab“ and given a fillip to radical forces. “This kind of conduct must be snubbed,“ Badal said.
 
 SAD president said Kejriwal also had a moral responsibility to tell Punjabis why he had stayed at the residence of a “dreaded militant“. “Not only did you (Kejriwal) stay at the residence of the KCF terrorist, but also held a meeting with radical elements and made calls to foreign countries,“ Sukhbir alleged.
 
 He said Punjabis had a right to know why Kejriwal was holding repeated meetings with “extremist elements“. “Earlier, you met members of   (BKI) front organisation Akhand Kirtani Jatha, including RP Singh, at Mohali. You have also held meetings with radical elements who organised a separatist conclave more than a year ago,“ Sukhbir said.
 
 AAP's in-charge of Punjab affairs, Sanjay Singh, however, said the man who the Punjab deputy CM had called a terrorist was a citizen of the UK and had been acquitted in a case registered against him falsely.
 
 Terming Sukhbir's allegations “imaginary, false, and motivated“, Sanjay said Sukhbir had found an “easy escape route from his misdeeds“ by naming everybody who questioned him as a terrorist or a supporter of radicals and anti-national elements.
 
 Sukhbir, however, said such instances proved that “Kejriwal was hand in glove with radical elements“. “It also proves that the AAP con vener is ready to go to any extent for a few votes; even compromise the unity and integrity of the country,“ he said.
