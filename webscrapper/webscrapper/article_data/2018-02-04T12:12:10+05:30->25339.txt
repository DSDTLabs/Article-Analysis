BENGALURU: Security for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally on Sunday has been ramped up with 3,000 policemen led by commissioner T   keeping a close watch on the proceedings at Palace Grounds.

 
 Eleven DCPs along with 33 ACPs will lead security teams. Fifty platoons of the Karnataka State Reserve Police and 30 platoons of the City Armed Reserve have been deployed in and around Palace Grounds, Suneel Kumar said, adding that three DCPs and 11 ACPs will monitor traffic.
 
  
  
 “Parking of vehicles in and around Palace Grounds has been restricted. There are four entries to Palace Grounds and each has to pass four levels of security checks,” a cop said.
 
 The BJP dropped its plan to hire trains to ferry supporters and will bring them by buses. It had approached SWR to hire 10 special trains. Sources said it would be difficult to ensure if all people coming by trains actually attended the rally.
 
 No nod for pakoda stalls
 
 Activists from National Students Union of India approached police commissioner, seeking permission to set up pakoda stalls around Palace ground as a token of protest against Modi’s recent comment saying baking pakoda indicates self employment. “We have denied the permission,” Suneel Kumar said.
