VADODARA: A group of students of the Institute of Leadership and Governance (ILG) on Saturday challenged their former batch mate Romel   to come for an open debate over the rustication row. The students, who approached TOI, said that Sutariya is spreading a canards by connecting the meeting with   leader Kanhaiya Kumar with his discontinuation from the one year diploma programme at ILG. “Institute is a neutral platform where all ideologies are respected,” the group of students said, adding that if meeting Kanhaiya Kumar was the reason behind the so-called rustication, even they would have got rusticated. “The fact is that we all had met the JNU leader during our study tour at Delhi. It was on March 1 that the institute had put a notice stating that all the students who are supposed to pay their pending fees and documents should do so by March 5,” the group of five students from the current batch of ILG told TOI. The students stressed that Sutariya is unnecessarily connecting the two dots and giving false statements to rake up an issue and hog limelight. tnn
