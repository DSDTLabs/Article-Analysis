HYDERABAD:   at   were left shell-shocked on Thursday after police unraveled that human sacrifice was performed in their locality.

 A visit to accused Rajashekar's house displayed his deep inclination for tantra. Superstition hung heavy at every nook and corner of the house with   and in rooms to ward off evil.
 
 "What has happened is disgusting. He cannot escape punishment from God,” said an elderly woman at the lane, expressing horror. Balamani, another woman, wondered how the family went to the extent of killing a baby to invoke spirits. “They should be given severe punishment for beheading a baby,” she said.
 
 Crowds thronged the neighbourhood near Rajashekar’s residence, discussing the incident. But while horror swept Chilkanagar locality, the residents who are mostly factory workers, are also deep into superstition.
 
 “We are at a loss to understand how he could perform human sacrifice. We got no inkling about what he was up to,” said a neighbour of Rajashekar. They are equally surprised at how his wife,  , agreed to such a heinous ritual. Rajasekhar’s in-laws and other relatives also reside in houses in the same lane. His   was the first to notice the severed head on the roof-top. There are four rooms in the house. Several unused things were found strewn in the front of the doors inside the compound wall. No one has a word of sympathy for Rajasekhar and his wife.
