PANAJI: Many   and   who hadn't sent in their postal ballots, took advantage of the special facilitation camp organized by the chief electoral office of the   on Saturday to cast their ballots.

 To ensure that postal ballots arrive well before the deadline- 8 am on March 11- a special facilitation camp is being organised in all the offices of Returning Officers on Saturday to allow government servants and police personnel who were on polling duty on February 4 to cast their postal ballots. 
 
 A general sms has been sent to all officials on polling duty who got postal ballots, to come out in large numbers to cast their ballots. The camp is taking place between 9:30 and 5:30 where candidates and their agents have been given the liberty to witness the entire process. 
 
 A gazetted officer/ magistrate has been posted at the offices to certify the identity of those to whom postal ballots have been issued to and to authenticate their declarations. 
 
 There will be no training on how to cast   but only facilitation. 
 
 All RO offices have one sealed box to receive postal ballots. There will be no tracking of who has cast a PB as no such list is maintained and nor it is possible.
 
 Postal Ballots will be received upto beginning of counting ie 8 am on March 11. Those that arrive later will not be considered for counting. 
 
 The chief electoral office of the election commission has warned that it will take strong action against anyone who tries to bribe/pressurize any official to cast a postal ballot in his favour. Similarly strong action will be taken against any polling official having postal ballot, asking for bribe or accepting any gift/money etc from anyone for casting postal ballot in anyone's favour or violating secrecy of voting. They will further be subjected to disciplinary proceedings under   as applicable to Government Servants the CEO office has stated.
