PANAJI: The state witnessed an impressive turnout of 53 per cent voters as of 1pm on Saturday as residents took to booth in their respective constituencies early morning onwards to elect its new state legislative assembly.

 The voting process which started at 7am is going on smoothly at most constituencies. People were seen coming with their voters’ ID card and standing in the queue at the regular polling stations, besides the turnout at special women’s booths and disabled booth.
 
 Several first-time women voters who cast their ballot were given pink teddy bears.
 
 Enthusiasm in some booths was much more than in others. No untoward incidents were reported even as tight patrolling is being maintained at each sensitive booth. Over 50 companies of paramilitary forces, in addition to 3500 personnel of Goa police, have been deployed for election duty across the state and other strategic locations to maintain law and order.
 
 A few glitches were reported as EVM malfunctioning delayed voting at some polling booths. The breakdown of machines led to serpentine queues of restless voters waiting outside.
 
 A total of 251 candidates are contesting the polls for 40 assembly seats. Goa has 11.1 lakh registered voters, who are entitled to exercise their votes. Polling ends at 5 pm today.
