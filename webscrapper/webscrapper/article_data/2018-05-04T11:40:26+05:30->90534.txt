LUCKNOW: Pleasant   prevailed in the city on Thursday due to low temperatures and gusty winds following thundershowers late on Wednesday night. However, as temperatures are expected to rise by 2-3 degrees, conditions would turn sultry on Friday and Saturday. 

 The thunderstorm lasted for half an hour followed by around 2mm rains. Gusty winds thereafter led to a drop in minimum temperature which was 21.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The impact of the breeze and moisture content in the atmosphere was felt even during the day as maximum temperature could not rise beyond 32.8 degrees Celsius-seven degrees below normal. 
 
 Met officials said the 'trough line' passing over UP had been responsible for the thunderstorm but has now fizzled out. Friday and Saturday would be mainly clear and result in rise in mercury levels. 
 
 Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to be around 35 and 22 degrees Celsius respectively. As humidity levels are also expected to be high, sultry weather conditions would prevail.
