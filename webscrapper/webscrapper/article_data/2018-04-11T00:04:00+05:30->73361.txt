Madurai: The rivalry between two state ministers came to fore once again, after a party post given to a supporter of Sellur K Raju was scrapped the same day as minister R B Udayakumar was allegedly not in favour of it. In a joint statement issued on Monday by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, Kremmer Suresh, a staunch supporter of Raju was appointed the Madurai urban district secretary of Jayalalithaa Peravai. The statement was reportedly made on Monday morning. Revenue minister R B Udayakumar left for Chennai on Monday afternoon and on Monday evening the AIADMK high command announced that Suresh was dismissed from the post. Speaking to TOI, Suresh said that he was being made a scapegoat in the issues that exist between the two ministers. He said that the appointment had come as a surprise as he never craved for any party post. “I went and met the district secretary (Sellur Raju) as this posting left to the discretion of the district secretary and I was told that he had recommended me for it. But a dismissal in the same evening was a disappointment,” he said. Asked if he thought that minister Udayakumar was behind his dismissal, he said that he was not sure, but that he (Udayakumar) was the state head of the posting that had been given to him. “I have been in this party since 2006 and was close to Amma. I worked for her after leaving the DMK. I wouldn’t mind if they had said that this posting was changed or handed over to someone else, but they have dismissed me, which looks as though I am incompetent,” he said. AIADMK sources say that Suresh had been planning a big celebration for his new posting. However, the dismissal has come as a shock to him, his supporters and also to minister Raju. There is a huge divide among the supporters of Raju and Udayakumar in Madurai and many of them do not even bother to hide it.
