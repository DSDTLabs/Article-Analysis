Patna: A 22-year-old man was arrested from Jairampur village in   district on Tuesday for allegedly sexually abusing a seven-month-old infant.

 The accused Sunil Kumar is the victim’s neighbour. “Sunil had taken the child away from her house for about half an hour. When he dropped her back, she was bleeding from her private parts,” said Murliganj SHO Jai Prakash Chaudhary. Following this, villagers caught and thrashed Sunil before handing him over to cops. “Sunil had inserted his fingers in the child’s private parts, causing injury,” Chaudhary said. A medical board examined the infant on Wednesday and the report is awaited. “Sunil was earlier jailed in an Arms Act case and had been released about two-and-a-half months ago.”
