Gurgaon: Assamese singer-actor Bidisha Bezbaruah’s husband Nisheeth Jha was produced in a city court on Wednesday and taken on one-day police remand. Police sources said preliminary probe has indicated that Nisheeth is in a relationship with an office colleague based in Mumbai.

 Immediately after getting his custody, cops took Nisheeth to one of his friend’s place in Ghaziabad and recovered his mobile phone from there. He had visited his friend’s house first while returning to Gurgaon from Mumbai on Tuesday and left his cell phone over there, police said.
 
 And sources said that Nisheeth’s call records have revealed that he was in constant touch with a particular number, which could be that of his female colleague. He had gone to Mumbai to meet his girlfriend on the pretext of official work, sources said. “The reason behind Bidisha’s suicide could be the extra-marital affair of her husband. We have recovered his mobile phone and are investigating the case. The picture will be clear soon,” Deepak Saharan, DCP (east), told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday ordered police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar to expedite the investigation. 27-year-old Bidisha was found dead inside her ninth floor Gurgaon flat, hanging from a ceiling fan with a dupatta tied around her neck, on Monday evening. Bidisha’s father has accused Nisheeth of having an extra-marital affair. Nisheeth, who is originally from Gujarat, works for AFCONS India. They got married on April 28 last year.
 
 An FIR has been registered against Nisheeth Jha under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC at Sushant Lok police station and he was arrested on Tuesday evening. Ashiwni Kumar Bezbaruah, Bidisha’s father, Wednesday reiterated that his daughter was mentally disturbed due to her husband’s extra marital affair.
