LUCKNOW: The recent transfer of   (LDA) deputy secretary   to   municipality came after a series of letters over a period of eight months from   authorities. The authorites had been writing to her parent department—urban development—to transfer her from her current deputation in LDA, where she has spent 22 years.

 “She has been transferred to   municipality with effect from this month,” said principal secretary, urban development,  .
 
 
 Though her parent department is urban development, Bisht has been on deputation to LDA for 22 years.
 
 LDA had first written to the department on June 5 last year, requesting her transfer from LDA and then again on August 25 as she had extended her deputation tenure much beyond the maximum limit of seven years.
 
 TOI is in possession of copies of both the letters.
 
 The deputation norm says that a person can be deputed for five years and the period can extend to a maximum of two years, following special approval of the finance department.
 
 The letter from LDA, written on August 25, 2017, says: “LDA has not received order for her transfer yet though we feel it is necessary that she should be transferred considering the long term she has served with LDA.”
 
 Her transfer order came only in January this year. A senior official of the urban development department said, “Her transfer is a result of persistence by LDA authorities. The orders must have been given much earlier, but departmental proceedings may have taken long.”
