Dhingra scored 98.6% in Class XII science, which is the highest score in this stream, in the state. His interest neither is in in medical nor engineering.

 Dhingra stood first in the city in   class XII Science with 493 marks out of 500. He scored 100 in chemistry, 100 in biology, 100 in maths, 98 in English and 95 in physics. “I want to break the myth that the main career options in science stream are engineering or medical. I stood 14,000 in JEE-Main and my chances in JEE-Advanced are very high. Even in NEET my score which I have evaluated indicates that I can crack this exam. Yet I will apply for BSc honours in chemistry from any prestigious university,” said Dhingra.
 
 Dhingra has always been a strong boy, he lost his mother at the age of seven. Being a single child, he has lived all his life with his father and grandparents. “My father has always supported me and I am under no pressure to go for either medical or engineering,” said Dhingra. He took tuitions for a short period but relies on self-study.
 
 “I did not take coaching for even JEE and NEET. I gave 6 to 8 hours daily which I find are sufficient to score high,” said Dhingra, who was very active on the social media even during exams and takes it as a stress reliever. He is also known for maintaining 100% attendance year after year. Reading fiction and nonfiction books are his favourite hobby.
