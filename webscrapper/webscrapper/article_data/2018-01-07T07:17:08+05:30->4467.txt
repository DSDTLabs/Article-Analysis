PUNE: Many data analysis tools have been developed by technical institutions to help in personalised medicine, drug repurposing and in identifying genomics but lack of doctors in research and analysis is hindering utilisation of such tools, according to  , associate director at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing ( ).

 C-DAC will launch two new tools — Gamut and Lambda — for genomic and structural data analysis respectively on January 9 coinciding with a symposium titled Accelerating Biology- Digitizing life.
 
 Joshi, who also heads high performance computing: medical and bioinformatics applications division at C-DAC, said, “Hospitals don’t do genomics at present. There is no genome repository in India. Research in medical fraternity is also low. So even if you can have the entire genomic sequencing in front of you in 6 minutes, you have no clue what it means if a doctor isn’t using the data,” said Joshi.
 
 Gamut is a big data management solution for life sciences data like genomics. 
 
 A researcher using Gamut can search data base using text-based, chromosome position-based and gene name-based queries.
 
 Currently it contains data pertaining to South Asian, African and European descent. “The tool will help in personalising medicine for the end user. Such a tool provides a glimpse of underlying similarity and variations that can be a key point for further analysis. Also this provides results instantly despite going through millions of data bytes,” said  , joint director, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing.
 
 If Gamut is for genomic data, Lambda provides platform for various analytics of structural data of biomolecules. “This will help in drug discovery and other biological functions. In a specific case, Hydrogen bond analysis of Lambda is 13.8 times faster than the conventional tool,” added Joshi.
