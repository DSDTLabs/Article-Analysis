LONDON: Sweden has something to tell the world — news that could shock the palate.

 Swedish  , the signature national dish, are really Turkish.
 
 The country’s national Twitter account made the announcement in a tweet this week. “Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe   brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century,” the tweet said. “Let’s stick to the facts!”
 
 It was not immediately clear why Sweden decided that now was the right time to set the record straight, but the admission created a storm of reaction.
 
 Turks rejoiced. Some Swedes were dismayed.
 
 “My whole life has been a lie,” one Swede lamented on Twitter. Some Turks urged Sweden to change the name of its meatballs to the Turkish name, “kofte.”
 
 Turkish media called the Swedish tweet a “confession” and suggested that Charles, who reigned from 1697 to 1718 and spent some years in exile in the Ottoman Empire early in the 18th century, took other Turkish products back to Sweden, including coffee beans and stuffed cabbage.
 
 The private Turkish news agency Dogan news agency went to the northwestern city of Inegol, which is famous for its meatballs, to get a reaction to the announcement.
 
 Ibrahim Veysel, a chef at a local meatball restaurant, exulted, “It is an honour that these tastes have become an example to different cuisines all over the world.”
 
 The Swedish statement raised many burning questions, among them: What does it mean for Ikea? The Swedish furniture giant has long made   a staple of its cafeterias in stores worldwide.
 
 But there may be no cause for panic.
 
 Even in Turkey, where meatballs are readily available at food stalls, cafes and restaurants, many families flock to Ikea on the weekends to eat Swedish meatballs on the cheap: A portion of eight meatballs with sides of fries and vegetables costs about $1.60 (Rs 106).
