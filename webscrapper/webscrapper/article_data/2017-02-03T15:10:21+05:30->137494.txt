PATNA: In a major catch, excise sleuths seized a consignment of   (IMFL) worth Rs 1.5 crore from   under the   area in   on Thursday.

 The 4,536 bottles of IMFL, packed in 378 cartons, had been stored in a poultry farm of former Sanathi sarpanch Lalita Devi’s husband Jitendra Rai. Apart from Rai, three people were arrested and a country-made pistol, four cartridges, two bikes and one tractor seized from the former sarpanch’s residential premises.
 
 Sources said the seized liquor bottles had labels of ‘Made in Haryana’. Earlier on January 29, altogether 319 cartons of Haryana-made IMFL were seized from a truck near Maithi Toll Plaza under the Gaighat police station area in Muzaffarpur district. 
 
 The consignment of 3,828 bottles seized from Maithi was estimated to be worth Rs 1.25 crore in open market. Two people were arrested in this connection.
 
 Muzaffarpur excise superintendent Kumar Amit said they had received a tip-off that liquor was being sold in the village. “We conducted a raid two days back, but failed to locate any consignment,” he said and added fresh raids were conducted on receipt of reports that a liquor consignment from Haryana was unloaded at the poultry farm on Wednesday night.
 
 “This time, we managed to unearth the contraband,” the excise superientendent said. According to him, six cartons full of liquor bottles were seized from a cow-shed inside Rai’s residence. The arms and ammunition recovered during the raid were also hidden inside the cow- shed, he said.
 
 “Our preliminary investigations suggest Rai was a wholesale smuggler of liquor and used to make supplies to local smugglers in different parts of Muzaffarpur and other districts,” the excise superintendent said.
