 BRJP managing director Rajesh Meena said a sum of Rs 369.93 crore had been approved for construction of tube wells, storage reservoirs and laying of pipelines in the four towns. Meena said the work would complete by July next year. 
 
 “Altogether 53 reservoirs of 35,400kilolitre capacity will be constructed to cater to the needs of people in the four towns,” Meena added. 
 
 Sources said work on the first phase of AMRUT scheme was already in progress in nine towns – Hajipur, Bagaha, Motihari, Chhapra, Siwan, Aurangabad, Saharsa, Buxar and Jehanabad.
 
 The government has targeted to make piped water facility available in 21 towns in the state under AMRUT. The towns have been divided into eight categories. First priority will be given to the towns which have already prepared detailed project report. 
 
 According to the AMRUT guidelines, the central government’s share of project funding is 50% of the total project cost for urban local bodies (ULBs) with population between 1 lakh to 10 lakh and 33.33% for ULBs with more than 10 lakh population. The state government is required to meet a minimum 20% share of the project cost and the remaining amount is to be met by the ULBs from their own revenues. In Bihar, 25 AMRUT cities, except Patna, have less than 10 lakh population.
