PUNE: The Pune   has finally approved proposals to construct two foot overbridges (FOBs) to deal with the traffic snarls near its headquarters in Golibar Maidan.

 The move comes after many traffic snarls and quite a number of accidents over the years, some resulting in fatal injuries.
 
 Pedestrians often have a tough time crossing roads at the Golibar Maidan intersection, due to heavy traffic almost throughout the day. The situation is particularly complicated by the presence of the   on Shankarsheth Road, and a school on Castellino Road near Solapur Bazaar.
 
 Locals have often complained of several small and big accidents on this stretch, which have pedestrians and motorists alike, sometimes fatally. The traffic police have also pushed for the building of these FOBs. A proposal to build them had been lying in the board’s files for years, but chronic financial mismanagement had made it difficult.
 
 Now, however, Board officials say they have enough funds to construct these FOBs, which it considers ‘vital’. 
 
 Officials of the board say they are prioritizing the Castellino Road FOB for now, as its drawings are ready and the Southern Command has budgeted for it.
