NEW DELHI: Seven months after the finance officer of a private school in Gurgaon was beaten to death by a group of men,   has arrested two people, including a prime suspect. Gurgaon police had earlier arrested three people, including a property dealer from Bahadurgarh, Bhupender Singh Dalal, who had differences with the school over his child's admission. 

 The arrested men, Vinod Bhagat (27) and Amit, belong to   of southwest Delhi. Amit had got himself admitted to a rehab centre after the murder to dodge the police. "ACP Jasbir Singh's team got a tip-off about the killer hiding in a de-addiction centre in Dwarka after which he was arrested. The arrested men disclosed that they knew Dalal through a gangster named Pawan Nankheri and did the job at his behest," DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh said.
 
  On May 19, 2017, the finance officer, Tarun Pandey, was attacked by a group of men, including Dalal, with sticks and iron rods outside his house. The victim was admitted to hospital with fractures in both hands and right leg and later succumbed to his injuries. 
 
 Pandey, a native of Allahabad, lived with his wife and 14-year-old son in H-Block of Palam Vihar and worked at   in Sector 22, Gurgaon. He had been dealing with Dalal on behalf of the school. He was targeted after the school decided not to promote Dalal's son citing poor academic performance in 2016-2017, police said.
 
 The school management had suggested that the child be admitted to another school, but Dalal and his wife refused to take their son away. Instead, they allegedly started threatening the school principal and staff to get their son promoted to Class VI.
 
 In his statement to police, Pandey had said, "While I was parking my car, the men told me that the school principal's husband had asked me to come to Ansal Plaza. When I refused, they pulled me out and beat me." Pandey's wife said Dalal had even visited him in the hospital to threaten him.
