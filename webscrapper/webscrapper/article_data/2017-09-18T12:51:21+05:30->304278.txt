BHOPAL: Kolar township is waiting for chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s bonanza with regards to infrastructure as he undertakes a visit to the township on Monday. The township is all set to get transformed as a slew of development schemes is likely to be announced by the chief minister.

 Kolar Municipality, was merged into Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) 2015.
 
 Several projects have been mooted for the works for the area. The most important one includes the laying of a sewage network and drinking water supply. In 2016, Rs 53 crore was allocated for laying pipelines and bring water to each household in Kolar. The project is expected to be functional by 2018.
 
 Civic body has also focussed on extending Bus City Link Limited buses in Kolar. Three new routes are planned for the area and more would be introduced if there is a public demand, said BCLL director and BJP corporator Keval Mishra. He hinted projects worth crores of rupees could be announced for the Kolar and nearby villages that were included into BMC limits. 
 
 BMC budget outlay in March had increased funds for installation of street lights and water pipeline for Kolar area. A new sewer system as announced by CM in 2015 would be developed at the cost of Rs 80 crore, while Rs 20 lakh have been allotted for solid waste management in the area. 
 
 A sum of Rs two crore was allocated under Jan Bhagidiri (public participation) scheme. For development of welcome arches (Swagat Dwar), statues and parks a sum of Rs one crore was made available. 
 
 Going by a BMC survey, top three challenges faced are decline in greenery, cleanliness and sewerage, sanitation and power outage.
 
 “Electricity breakdown and regular water supply are major issues we have to jostle with on a regular basis. The area needs more funds and development focus,” said Sameer Singh, a resident of Kolar. 
 
 “Removal of illegal hawkers and vegetable vendors in areas like Kolar is needed. There is only one major road that is the lifeline of the area. It needs to be encroachment free for smooth flow of traffic,” said Sunita, a housewife and resident of Sarvdharam colony. 
 
 A population of about two lakh has been disposing municipal waste in the low lying areas in general and in drainage in particular, causing problem. Kolar is among most rapidly developing suburban area of Bhopal. Main Kolar area comprises of ward 80 (Sarvdharam Kolar), ward 82 (Danish Kunj) ward 83 (Sankhedi), and BMC ward 29.
