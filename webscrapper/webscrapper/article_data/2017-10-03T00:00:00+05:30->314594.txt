Coming all the way from France, Gael Katako is excited as he learns about Indian culture. “My cousin recommended that I study in India. Since he had studied in   University, he suggested I do the same. I found it very interesting and here I am,” says Gael. 

 Having friends in the college and in a different city helps adjust to a new place, adds Gael. “I haven’t had any problems adjusting in Bengaluru as I have many friends here,” says Gael. When asked which his favourite hangout in the city is, he said, “The amuzement park on   is one of my favourite places in the city. I went there once with my friends and absolutely loved it.”
 
 Although he is not a big fan of the South Indian food, Gael says that the only problem he has faced till date is the chilli used in Indian food. “I do not mind the spice and the masalas, but chilli makes it difficult for me to have the   here. But I am getting used to it now,” he sums up.
