Surat: The Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) in partnership with a Mumbai-based private construction firm Hub Town has rebuilt Adajan bus depot, equipping it with state-of-the-art facilities and enchanting landscaping.

 This two-floor structure, built on 42,000 sqm land, is equipped with passenger luggage trolleys, heart shaped selfie space, GPS, passenger dormitory, apart from 14 platforms, 10 of which will be used for parking buses. People can wait for the bus at a heart-shaped space. There are separate facilities for disabled persons ranging from canteen, wheel chairs to toilet blocks. 
 
 Nikunj Hadial, deputy engineer at GSRTC, told TOI, “This bus depot has facilities like GPS system, public announcement system, 75 public luggage trolleys for passengers and round-the-clock security. It will soon be dedicated to the people.” 
 
 Landscaping and graffiti on walls give the bus depot an altogether new look. “The works of art give a new identity to the bus depot and will rejuvenate the passengers tired from a long journey,” said Rajesh Shah, a resident of Adajan.
 
 The ground floor of the bus depot has a cloakroom, RO water plants, toilets and bathrooms, seating arrangements and canteen facilities. The first floor will house offices, VIP restroom, storerooms and restrooms for drivers and conductors. Passenger dormitory is on the second floor. The private partner, who will maintain it for a period of 30 years, has been given space to build a 12-floor commercial complex at a cost of Rs10.53 crore which is expected to benefit nearly 6 lakh people of the area.
 
 “This is one of the first bus depots to be rebuilt by the GSRTC on a PPP basis. Some others are under various stages of construction,” a GSRTC officer said.
 
 People can get buses to north Gujarat, Vadodara, Bharuch, Olpad and other parts of the state from Adajan bus depot. People living in Rander, Adajan, Pal and Hajira would immensely benefit from this depot.
