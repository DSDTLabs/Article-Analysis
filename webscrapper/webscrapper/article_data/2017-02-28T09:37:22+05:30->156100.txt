KENDRAPADA: The sluggish pace of work of a solid waste management facility in the port town of Paradip has invited the ire of residents and environmentalists. 

 In the absence of a proper waste disposal facility, residents are forced to burn waste, thereby causing air pollution and smog-like conditions in the port town areas. "The burning of garbage poses a serious health hazard as it releases harmful gases. Despite our repeated pleas for expediting work to the authorities concerned, nothing has been done so far," said  , an environmentalist and secretary of   in Paradip. 
 
 In 2010, the state government in its integrated coastal zone management project (ICZM) had planned to build a solid waste management plant over 20 acres of land at the cost of Rs 14.26 crore. The proposed project was set to come up within three years from the time of announcement. As part of the project, a solid waste landfill and treatment facility and coastal management laboratory for monitoring the environmental parameters were to be set up in the port town of Paradip.
 
 The objective was to create a landfill and garbage processing facility supported by collection and correct disposal of garbage generated from the coastal town and its nearby areas. The landfill and garbage processing facility were to be set up at   village on the outskirts of Paradip town. Once complete, the project would have led to a long-term scientifically managed solid waste landfill facility for Paradip. 
 
 Last year, the authorities had built a boundary wall over the proposed project site. "We hope the project will be completed this year. The total municipal solid waste generation in Paradip is estimated to be about 51 metric tonne per day. The project got delayed due to land acquisition problem," said  , the assistant executive engineer of Paradip municipality.
 
 The   (OSPCB) has also come down heavily on Paradip municipality for its failure to check waste-burning in the port town.
