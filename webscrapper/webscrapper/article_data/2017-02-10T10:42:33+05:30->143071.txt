AHMEDABAD:   (Marwadi) is all of 12 but she has jumped into the role of elder sister and caregiver for Puni, 10, and Usha, 7. On Thursday evening, five days after a   ran over her parents Bhagabhai, 40, and Lakshmi, 35, she sits near their photograph on the same   as her sisters are sleep near her feet.

 “I don’t get much sleep these days but I make sure they forget everything and start looking forward,” she says, while chatting with other relatives on the pavement. 
 
 The last five days were busy for her, with the who’s-who of the city meeting her and condoling the loss that can never be truly compensated.
 
 She knows that she and her sisters will each get Rs 1 lakh from the city police’s special corpus for accident victims, but says that they have not planned anything. About the proposal that they be sent to school for a better future, she shrugs and says that she is ‘too old’ for studies. “But I will make sure that my sisters get an education. I may just continue selling balloons,” says Dhani.
 
 The ordeal may not be over for the sisters. As the family has still stuck together, talk of compensation and money has already created a rift with the extended family. When TOI visited the spot on Thursday, one relative quipped that they also ought to get something. After all, one girl has almost lost her hands and others have sustained injuries which will throw their lives out of gear for a while.
 
 City police have announced Rs 3 lakh for the girls who became orphans on February 4. Senior police officials said that they have already created a trust that will manage the funds, anticipating the upheavals hard cash may create. “We appealed to citizens to contribute to the cause. We may replicate the efforts if another such devastating incident takes place,” said a senior city police official. Two of the girls, having issues with their eyesight, were treated at Nagri Eye Hospital whereas the other victims were treated at Civil Hospital free of cost.
