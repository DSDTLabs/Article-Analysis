NAGPUR: Banks are facing another spell of cash crunch since over a week. Even though the situation may not be like the demonetisation days, once again the   have run dry in many places.

 TOI did a survey covering 30 ATMS along an over 10 km track covering residential as well as market areas on Tuesday. It was seen that 11 ATMs did not have cash. TOI covered areas like Jairpatka, Byramji Town, Katol Road, Mahal and Gandhibagh. The ATMs of almost all the major banks were seen dry. Most of the dry ATMs were in the market areas. 
 
 Sources in the banking industry say that   has reduced the amount of cash remittances. There are theories that RBI is keeping the cash supplies low so that the cashless mode of transactions is promoted. Regional heads in three major banks told TOI that budgeting on note supply is expected to have been imposed so that cashless gets a push.
 
 Each bank places an indent with the RBI for supply of notes. Even before note ban the supply used to slightly less than what was demanded. However, now the gap has increased. “For example if a bank had asked for Rs100 crore, earlier it used to get Rs80 crore. Now it has come down to Rs60 crore instead, especially recently. Banks too have inflated their demands to adjust,” said a source in a PSU bank.
 
 Bankers said, several ATMS had run dry as the machines could not be refilled on Saturday on Sunday. Banks could not provide enough cash to the agencies outsourced the jobs, for the holidays, said sources.
 
 A section of bankers including sources in the RBI said that the shortage has been rather due to printing of currency going down at security press. 
 
 “The staff had worked overtime at the press, soon after the note ban. Too much stressed the staff too has slowed down the work now. This has reduced supply from the press itself. The RBI is distributing whatever supply it gets,” said a source.
