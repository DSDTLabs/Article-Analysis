Vadodara: Most parents in the country are suffering from fear psychosis which is driving them to wrong ways of parenting. This is what child specialists and paediatricians from across the country opined here during a workshop on ‘Parenting and Parenteening’ organized by the Academy of Paediatrics, Vadodara here on Sunday. 

 “Parents are role models for children. But they are themselves suffering from fear psychosis. They are not being able to talk to their own children whereas the fact is that a parent is child’s best friend,” said Dr   from Nagpur. 
 
 Ahmedabad-based teenager’s health consultant Dr Nishchal Bhatt said that parents often complaint that children these days are getting out of hand. 
 
 “In fact, in majority of cases, it is the parents who are at fault and not the children. Parents are role models for any child. If parents themselves drive on the wrong side, kids will learn that. If parents fail to control their anger, kids too will learn that,” he said, adding that parents need to discipline their child. 
 
 “There is a difference between aggression and assertiveness. Parents should not get frightened if their child cries. Crying is child’s language. Instead you should be worried about the compromises you make which will damage his life,” he said.
 
 “Parents, especially mothers, often run behind the child to make them eat. There is no need to do so. If the child feels hungry, he or she will eat. Parents responsibility is to provide right food, at right time and in right atmosphere,” said child specialist Dr  . 
 
 Parents often complain that their kids gorge on chocolates, watch too much of cartoons or constantly play with mobile phones. 
 
 “The question is who provides them chocolates, allow them to continuously watch cartoons or hand over mobile phones to them,” said Pandya, sharing LEAD (unconditional Love, setting right Example, Acceptance of children as they are and inculcating Discipline in their life) as a tip for parenting.
