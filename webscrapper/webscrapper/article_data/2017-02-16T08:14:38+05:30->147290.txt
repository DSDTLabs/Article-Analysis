SURAT: Tens of thousands of commuters passing from   junction have heaved a sigh of relief as the city police have removed the barricade, which were set up as part of an experiment to control the traffic situation. 

 Sources said that the decision to remove the barricade was taken on Tuesday following all-round opposition and the traffic situation turning from bad to worse on the entire patch at Athwa junction. 
 
 After experimenting with the smooth flow of traffic at Delhi Gate and the Raj Marg from Bhagal to  , the city police wanted to implement similar traffic management system at Athwa junction. 
 
 On the part of the new traffic arrangement, vehicles coming from Majura Gate and going towards Adajan via the   were diverted from the Care hospital junction via Chowpaty. The commuters had to tread around one kilometre to get on the Sardar Bridge. 
 
 With the heavy inflow of vehicles, the Sardar Bridge remain chock-a-block during the peak hours. Also, the flyover connecting the Sardar Bridge was blocked for more than one hour on Tuesday due to the breakdown of a transport truck in the middle of the bridge. 
 
 “It is good that the police have removed the barricading on Athwa junction, otherwise it was creating lot of traffic chaos. Athwa is the junction where you get vehicles from six different directions. Without applying barricade, police needs to manage the traffic in efficient manner,” said a jeweller at Piplod, Rajesh Choksi.
 
 President of South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA), Jitu Vakharia, who regularly drives through the Athwa junction said, “There is an urgent need to demolish the mammoth traffic island at Athwa junction. The police and   (SMC) should think in this direction for effective management of traffic.”
