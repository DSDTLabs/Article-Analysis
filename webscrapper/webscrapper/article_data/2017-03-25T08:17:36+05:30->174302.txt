BENGALURU: Help was literally a click away, but Bengaluru never really paid heed. A panic button, which sends your   to cops in times of trouble, was added to   four years ago, but the idea didn't take off due to lack of downloads. However, with a growing concern about safety in the city, the feature is being relaunched as an app in itself.

 Learning from past mistakes, cops have this time decided to use their large social media presence to spread the word. Police have started a contest online, where citizens can name the brand-new panic button app.
 
 “The response has been great so far. We have already received over 400 names and will finalize one before the CM officially inaugurates the app in the next few days.Interestingly, even before the official launch we have had over 4,000 downloads (on Android platform) app and around 100 (on iOS platform),“ said  , police commissioner.
 
 The panic button was introduced in 2013 as part of the  . This time things have been packaged differently .“Whenever someone presses the button, the police command centre gets an alert. The app also sends the GPS location of the distress caller. As all police vehicles are tracked using GPS, we can identify the closest unit and dispatch cops to the location. This is monitored by a dedicated policeman,“ explained Sood.
 
 However, in its earlier version, the feature was used only a few times. One reason cited was lack of visibility of this feature on the app. Later, a decision was taken to make this an independent app. Police are hoping more people will make use of it. “The app will see more changes in future, where the camera will start automatically in case of an emergency and record sounds and visuals,“ said Sood.
