HYDERABAD:   and   are no more, but questions remain on the video in which Swathi allegedly gave a clean chit to her parents and blamed her husband and in-laws. Rachakonda police said they need to probe further to ascertain whether it was a selfie or was given under pressure from her father Srinivas Reddy, who is prime accused in Naresh’s murder. 

 The video statement was found in Srinivas’s mobile phone. Police said Swathi did not own a mobile phone. Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said they need to send the phone for forensic exam. “There are several unanswered questions. We need to take the culprits into custody to get more details,” he said. 
 
 When asked whether Swathi was aware about Naresh’s murder, police said that the duo, in their confession, claimed she was unaware of the killing. “Srinivas claimed he killed Naresh as he was upset about the ordeal his daughter had to go through in Mumbai after marriage. He claimed she was unaware about his death even on the day she ended her life,” the CP said. 
 
 During forensic exam, police came to know that Swathi was one-month pregnant. She had made three suicide attempts — one in Mumbai and twice in  . The video surfaced two days after her death. Police suspect she ended her life as she felt humiliated after some scribes went to interview her.
