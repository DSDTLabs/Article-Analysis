 Taking a dig at   and Congress, Aney said they fooled people over the years on statehood plank and later forgot all promises made before the elections. “Vidarbha is still reeling under various problems like farmers suicides, malnutrition, unemployment among others. We need to start somewhere and it was reason, Viraa was formed to fight for statehood by participating in the elections.   would be a mouthpiece for statehood struggle.”
 
 Vaidya stressed on the need to reconstitute state reorganization commission stating that no state should have population of over three crore. “Maharashtra should be divided into four parts, including Vidarbha for smooth administration. We at RSS already had four divisions in state. It’s not possible to have one language having one state. By that logic from Rajasthan to UP, there should one state. The government should itself come forward and detach Vidarbha, just like Chhattisgarh for progress of this region,” he said.
