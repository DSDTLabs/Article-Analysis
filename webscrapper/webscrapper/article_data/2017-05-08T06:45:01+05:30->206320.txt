GUWAHATI: After stepping down as secretary general of the Asam   in January following a  , Paramananda Rajbongshi   on Sunday. 

 Despite continuous opposition from some of the former presidents and litterateurs of the state, Rajbongshi took over as the secretary general of the apex literary body of the state as its core committee meeting gave a green signal for his return to the coveted post last month. The all-powerful core committee has also approved the return of noted litterateur Dhruba Jyoti Borah as president of the Sabha. 
 
 Rajbongshi said the Sabha plans on ushering drastic reforms. With this in mind, Sabha has constituted two committees for framing its constitution and envisioning a road map by next year. "Without thoroughly studying the rule book of the Sahitya Sabha, some of our well-wishers have been levelling allegations against us. Keeping in mind the limitations of the rule book, Sahitya Sabha will come up with a constitution by the end of the upcoming Bardumsa session to be held in Tinsukia district in February 2018. We hope the permanent constitution will help steer the Sabha's works based on established precedents," he added.
 
 The poll schedule to elect new office-bearers of the literary body will be announced in June, Rajbongshi said.
 
 The Sabha was mired in controversy ahead of its year-long centenary celebrations in December last year, when several noted litterateurs and former presidents of the Sabha questioned the 'totalitarian' way of its functioning under Rajbongshi. They accused him of influencing Sabha's works by forming an influential lobby, though Rajbongshi refuted the charges.
 
 Borah had resigned as the president in December after a rift with Rajbongshi as he wanted the secretary general's ouster ahead of the Sabha's centenary session.
