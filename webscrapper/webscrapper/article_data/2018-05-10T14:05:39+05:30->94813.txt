BICHOLIM: Residents of  ,   and Shirgao have been facing acute   shortage for more than 15 days. 

 Taps have run dry in areas like Bhatwadi, Kelbaiwada, Gaonkarwada, Devus Bhatwadi, Chimulwada, Ardhawada, and vicinity, as well as many parts of Chorao and Shirgao village panchayats. Although citizens have placed this matter before PWD Bicholim authorities, the crisis is yet to be resolved. 
 
 On Tuesday, the villagers brought it to the notice of Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye. After listening to their grievances, the legislator accompanied by Mayem sarpanch Vishwas Chodankar, Chorao sarpanch Pandhari Vernekar, Shirgao panch members Atchut Gaonkar, BJP spokesperson Premanand Mhambrey, Mayem BJP block president   and others visited Bicholim PWD office. 
 
 During the meeting, PWD officials informed that the crisis had arisen due to a technical fault at Padocem water treatment plant. They assured that water will be provided through tankers, and added that supply will be regularised by next week.
