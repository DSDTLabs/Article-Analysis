THANE: Warm clothes, sports gear, cameras and selfie sticks seem to have replaced books and question paper sets in school bags of many class X and XII students from the lake city. They are planning trips to hill stations and northern parts of the country to get away from the sweltering heat.

 Whether it’s with their friends, family or even nature groups, these youngsters are flocking to cool holiday destinations, including Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Manali and Simla.
 
 “Every holiday, my parents and I travel to different destinations. But this year, they have allowed me to go on a   with my friends. We decided to go to a place where the weather is coll as we are fed up of the heat here. So we zeroed in on Matheran. We will be going for a week starting Friday,” said Anjali Shastri (17), a Vartak Nagar resident who completed her HSC exam last month.
 
 Agreeing with Shastri, Sidhhachal resident Arvind Kopikar (14) who just completed his SSC exam, said, “My family and I are planning a tour to the north. We will be travelling to many places like Simla, Manali, Dharamshala and so on. These places are not so cold this time of the year. The heat has increased drastically in the last couple of weeks in the city. So, we decided to escape to a cool place this holiday.”
 
 While many students like Shastri and Kopikar are planning their vacation with their close friends and family, educational institutions and NGOs have also planned similar trips for students.
 
 “Like every year, academician and trustee of Jidnyasa trust Surendra Dighe have organised a trip to Manali for their SSC students. This will give them an opportunity to let them travel on their own and make new friends. It will also prepare them for a new start as they will be joining college soon,” said a member of Jidnyasa.
