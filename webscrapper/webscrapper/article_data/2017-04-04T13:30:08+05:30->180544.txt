PATNA: The   (IDA) has started the bidding process for the proposed IT tower near Dak Bungalow crossing. Senior officials in state information technology (IT) department said the actual construction work is likely to commence in six months.
 
  “The IT tower is proposed to be developed in public-private partnership ( ) mode. Accordingly, the IDA has commenced bidding process for roping in a firm as transaction adviser for the project. The transaction adviser is likely to be selected in a month, following which it would take another 4-5 months to commence the actual construction work. The proposed IT tower is to be ready in two years,” said Vishal Anand, officer on special duty at IT department.
  
  The approval for construction of the IT tower was given by the state cabinet at its meeting at Rajgir on January 17. The land for the IT tower is on the west side of Dak Bungalow petrol pump.
  
  Sources said the IT tower was initially proposed to be a G+8 building, which could provide workspace for around 4,00 people. Deliberating on the modalities of the IT tower, Vishal said: “The land would be given to the concessionaire on lease for 30 years. The concessionaire would develop the tower, distribute office spaces to the IT firms and collect rentals to cover the expenses it would bear in developing the tower.”
  
  IT industry experts have hailed the state government move. “We have been demanding such a tower where local IT entrepreneurs could get some space. Besides, firms from outside   have also expressed their interest in setting up their units in the state but their plans could not materialize owing to lack of any IT towers like those in bigger cities. The big IT companies are already looking for expanding their operations in tier-2 cities,” said  , secretary, Bihar IT Association.
  
  Patna apart, the state government has also mooted plans to develop IT city at Rajgir in   district over 200 acres of land.
