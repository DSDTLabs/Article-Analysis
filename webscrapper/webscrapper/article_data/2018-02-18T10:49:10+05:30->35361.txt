MARGAO: Former minister Francisco Xavier ‘Mickky’   on Saturday challenged chief minister  , who also holds the home portfolio, to immediately curb the matka trade being carried out in the state, or quit his post.

 Pacheco further challenged the legislators as well as political parties to publicly state that matka activities are non-existent in all constituencies.
 
 Speaking to the media, Pacheco questioned the home minister’s silence over non-action by the police to curb this menace and demanded to know if the government was supporting this illegality. 
 
 “I know Parrikar is unwell, and I pray that he gets better. But he should instruct the police to take immediate action to curb matka trade. The government should state what measures it has taken to halt these illegal activities,” he said. 
 
 “I am not making allegations, but only stating that every   is involved in running this illegal business that has destroyed families. In   and Benaulim constituencies of which I was an MLA, every policeman, right from the constable to the high ranking officer is involved in collecting ‘haftas’ from matka kingpins by threatening to arrest them if they do not cough up the amount. I also feel ashamed that now haftas are also being collected from lamanis, Kashmiris and those in the marble trade, especially in the coastal belt,” said Pacheco.
 
 “The opposition party is silent to the present functioning of the ruling BJP-led coalition government, with the alliance partners only indulging in self interest. It has been 11 months since this government was formed, but I cannot see any development, except for the ongoing work of the national highway,” he added.
