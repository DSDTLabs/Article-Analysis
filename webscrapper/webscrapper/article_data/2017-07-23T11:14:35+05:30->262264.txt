PUNE: Tourists to the popular hill station of   were disappointed on Saturday after police blocked the   road leading to the Bhushi Dam and Tiger/Lion Point areas after water from lakes and waterfalls flooded it following heavy rainfall.

 The   (City) police on Saturday morning decided to block the roads leading to the   road. Additional superintendent of police, Pune rural,   told TOI that the roads leading to these picnic spots were blocked as a precautionary measure.
 
 Police sent the motorists back from Lonavla city. “No one was allowed to go to the picnic spots at Tiger/Lion Point or the Bhushi dam area,” the police said, adding that water started flowing onto the road leading to the Bhushi dam late in the night.
 
 The hill station received a rainfall of 200mm between 8.30am on Friday and 8.30am on Saturday, the   (IMD) said. On Saturday, Lonavla registered a rainfall of 135mm after 8.30am.
 
 Water was gushing out of Bhushi dam — a popular picnic destination — at a great force. Also, the Lonavla dam was full to the brim and its water would be discharged into the Indrayani river.
 
 The Lonavla dam’s water was also flowing onto the road leading to Amby Valley. The irrigation department has sounded an alert in villages along the riverbank.
 
 A public address system is in place to make announcements. Also, the police are patrolling the picnic spots and the roads where revellers stop to enjoy rain.
 
 Apart from Lonavla, six fixed points had been in place at Tamhini ghat and Mulshi dam areas, Satpute said.
 
 Since the beginning of this month, unrelenting throng of travellers to the hill station coupled with incessant rain made for frequent snarls, sometimes stretching back kilometres.
 
 This prompted the police to clamped restrictions on traffic in and around Lonavla during weekends. This improved the situation somewhat in the hill station.
