 The book, geared toward young adults that address state violence directly, is an important and timely new title in such troubled times. Its story centres around 16-year-old Starr, a black girl who witnesses the shooting of her childhood friend by a police officer. Both Starr and her friend Khalil were rashly and wrongly judged by the court to be associated with gang violence; her offense being her skin colour. For the rest of the story, Starr copes with grief and guilt.
 
 Author Angie Thomas said that the book is inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, which began in 2012 as a response to the shooting of Trayvon Martin by the US police. 
  editor   shared that 
  is the top title on the paper’s bestseller list for Young Adult Hardcovers.

 It looks like the book’s success isn’t about to stop there, either: It’s already been optioned for a film starring Amandla Stenberg. The kids are going to be all right!
