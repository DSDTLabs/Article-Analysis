 “There was a sudden decline in wind speed from 0.50 metre per second to 0.29 metre per second on Thursday. The wind speed on Wednesday was 0.68 metre per second.

 Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has assured implementation of the graded response action plan (GRAP) for the ‘very poor’ category.
