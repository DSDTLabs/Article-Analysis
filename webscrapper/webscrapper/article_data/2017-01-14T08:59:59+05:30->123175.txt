PUNE: The   on Friday may persist for two more days because a dry wind is blowing from the northern India to Maharashtra. 

 A   can also be expected in the mornings, officials from the Indian Meteorological Department said. Pune recorded a   temperature of 26.9°C, and experienced a slight increase in   at 9.3°C.
 
 “There are dry conditions prevailing in the north, and it is getting colder there. The wind blowing from the north is behind the chill in the air here. Maximum temperature will remain below normal for two more days but it will remain almost constant,” said A K Shrivastava, head of climate monitoring and analysis at IMD, Pune.
 
 Winds blowing in from the oceans have increased the humidity levels, causing clouds to form over Maharashtra and Goa. This is also the reason for the increase in the minimum temperature. There will be no more fall in minimum temperatures. In fact, over the next five days, with the difference of a degree, minimum temperatures are expected to remain constant.
 
 On January 14, very light rainfall has been predicted at isolated places over north central Maharashtra and Marathwada.
 
  Light rainfall is also expected over Vidarbha, IMD has forecast.
