NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief   claimed that his Delhi house was attacked by 8-9 people late on Sunday night. Tiwari was not present in the house at the time of the incident. 

 "8-9 people have attacked my 159 North Avenue residence," Tiwari tweeted around 3am on Monday morning.
 
 "This was a janlewa (deadly) attack. Two of my people have been injured," Tiwari told ANI.
 
 According to an eyewitness, the attackers came in a group of 7 or 8 and hurled abuses at people present in Tiwari's house, ANI reported on Monday morning.
 
 Two people have been arrested in connection with the attack.
 
 
 
 
 However, police said that some men attacked employees of the BJP leader in the aftermath of a road rage incident.
 
 The two arrested men -- who are brothers -- were travelling in a car which bumped into a vehicle driven by one of 
 's staffers just outside the MP's house in Lutyens's Delhi at around 1.30am.
 
 The brothers called their friends who arrived armed with rods in a tempo and thrashed the MP's staff, a 
  aide said.
 
 They then entered his residence through a gate meant for public entry and tried to ransack the premises, a senior police officer said.
 
 Tiwari hit back by claiming there was a conspiracy behind the attack and alleged that the police was also involved in last night's incident.
 
 "It looks like a conspiracy and the police are involved in it. No one should be spared," 
  said.
