His elder son Swayam, 6, has been studying in the school since the 2015-16 academic year.

 “According to Parekh’s complaint, he had paid Rs 40,000 for his son’s admission in the junior KG class after he was assured that the school is affiliated with the CBSE,” said an investigator. “He claims that he had not been provided with any receipt for the payment, which was made by cheque. The authorities had also assured him that his son would be able to study up to class VIII.”
 
 Parekh also paid Rs 20,000 for the first semester of senior KG for 2016-17 and got no receipt. According to his complaint, he got to know about the crackdown on schools over dodgy affiliation through media reports and decided to check the status with the DEO. He, along with other parents, approached the DEO in February and asked whether the school was affiliated as claimed. In response to a letter dated February 22, the office replied in the negative.
 
 According to the complaint, 18-odd classes for junior and senior KG has over 400 kids. Meeting of parents revealed that the fee structure was uneven. The issue was taken up with the school’s trustee, Muktak Kapadia, who assured the parents that the students would get admission in affiliated courses of the CBSE under NCF Guidelines 2005. “We are yet to record statements of the school authorities and other parents. The probe is on,” said a Ghatlodia police official.
