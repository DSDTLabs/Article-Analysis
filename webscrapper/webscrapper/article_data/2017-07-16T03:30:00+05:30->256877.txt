Panaji: The ongoing hearing of the Mhadei River dispute on Friday saw the Mhadei river dispute tribunal bench pointing out discrepancies in the statement of Karnataka’s prime witness professor A K Gosain.  The tribunal’s turn to question Gosain came after he was cross-examined by Goa’s legal team, led by advocate Atmaram Nadkarni. Gosain was particularly questioned about his failure to use the daily discharge data from the hydrological observation station at Chapoli while doing the water availability study. “He was questioned as to why this data was not analysed for consistency checks and why such information was not used for the assessment of water availability. He admitted to have ignored it,” officials present at the hearing shared, adding that typographical errors were also highlighted. The tribunal also found problems with the way Gosain had conducted his analysis for the 2015 ‘Detailed project report of irrigation and multipurpose projects’. . The tribunal’s questioning comes at a time when the Karnataka government’s request for an out-of-court settlement of the issue has been quashed. Water resources minister Vinod Palyekar had rejected the offer.
