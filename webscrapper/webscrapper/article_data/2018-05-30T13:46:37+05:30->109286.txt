INDORE: The collector guidelines of   rates in 266 colonies of Indore has pushed enquiries from new buyers since they are low as compared to prices of land in nearby colonies and likely to rise in near term, according to leading developers and builders. 

 
 For the first time in 2018-19, rates of land in 266 out of total 572   have been finalised by district collector.   (CREDAI) president Vijay Gandhi said, “As this is the first time when these colonies have been considered for the guidelines rates, property here are   by over 30 per cent then nearby existing colonies. But, in the near term, their prices will rise significantly.”
 
 Across the state, Indore has the maximum number of illegal colonies. According to leading property consultants, fresh enquiries are pouring in for 266 colonies, which are being legalised, since rates are quite low and likely to rise in the near term. 
 
 Gandhi said, “The rates have increased the confidence of people in these property and the access to bank loans will also help people in making up their minds for purchase.”
 
 Industry experts said, fresh deals are expected in these 266 colonies since customers may get bank loan, which was earlier denied, on property in these colonies. They said all of these 266 colonies will now be properly developed and will have access to street light, drainage, road and other facilities.
 
 A builder Bhushan Suryavanshi said, “Government will get revenue, which was until now zero, from these colonies. Legal notary and registry of property will take place encouraging fresh deals.”
 
 Suryavanshi added that legalizing property in the poll-bound Madhya Pradesh will pave way for more such developments in the city. “System is not going to improve and illegal colonies will continue to mushroom because they know the government will legalise them to secure their vote bank,” he said.
