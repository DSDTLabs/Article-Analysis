It is the bits involving Priyadarshi (a fake chef) and Nani, along with the Murli Sharma (a magician with a massive ego) that bring some humour into an otherwise serious film. The film, instead of focusing on one main character, emphases on various characters and their stories; almost all taking place inside a coffee shop. To reveal more would be a grave injustice to the film. Devoid of songs, except for the theme that plays during the intriguing titles, 'Awe', so far, has been a taut and engaging ride. It remains to be seen how the loose ends all tie up in the second half.
