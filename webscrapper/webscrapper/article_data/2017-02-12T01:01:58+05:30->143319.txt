 Salem: About 80% of former   MPs, MLAs and functionaries in Salem on Saturday extended their unconditional support to O Panneerselvam, saying he was a dynamic leader with the capacity to run the government efficiently.
 
 Former MLAs M K Selvaraj and S E Venkatachalam, former mayor Suresh Kumar, former deputy mayor M Natesan and many other AIADMK functionaries held a meeting in Salem city on Saturday where discussed and passed a resolution to support   unconditionally.
 
 “The AIADMK general secretary, V K  , has threatened all the MLAs to support her to form the government. She has also “lodged” them in a private resort,” said M K Selvaraj. He urged the acting governor of Tamil Nadu, Vidyasagar Rao, to bring about a political situation in the state where all the MLAs can freely move around without any fear.
 
 Selvaraj, meanwhile, alleged that the AIADMK MLAs did not have any freedom to express their views. “They are forced to agree and go by whatever K Sasikala says,” he said.
 
 On his part, Venkatachalam urged the AIADMK MLAs to support either OPS or Sasikala based on the feedback of voters in their constituencies. 
 
 Krishnagiri constituency MP Ashok Kumar and Namakkal MP P R Sundaram also extended their support to OPS. They met the caretaker chief minister and assured their support. Addressing the media, the duo said Sasikala was making a back door attempt to capture the party and the government.
 
 “We will not allow her to capture the government and the party,” they said. The duo said all the AIADMK cadres, functionaries, former MPs and MLAs were ready to support OPS. “After his outburst, the number of AIADMK cadres have increased to two crore from 1.5 crore,” they said.
