PUNE: Baribai Barku, Munnibai Barela and many other tribal women from Karjane village   district are not aware of   (SBM), but they are in full support of any programme or scheme that will stop open defecation in villages.

 "I don't know what government is doing to stop open defecation, but I will be supportive of any such move. Women suffer most due to lack of   and it is very embarrassing. Many of us have developed habit to relieve only during dark hours and this has affected our health. We dont want our girls to suffer like us" said Baribai. Other women supported her saying that men are not bothered to construct toilets because they think that it was waste of money.
 
 " It is okay for men. They can go relieve anytime in the day. For women it is not possible. In remote areas it is more difficult as we have fear of men stalking around" say women in Karjane.
 
 In remote parts of Jalgaon, many tribal women are willing to construct toilets, but male members in family are not supportive. Under the SBM programme, the government provides a fund only after toilet is constructed and men who handle money matters are not ready to invest in toilets.
 
 But this is not the case only in rural areas. Even in towns like Indapur in Pune district, the government agencies and social workers are finding it difficult to convince men that toilet construction is essential for health reasons and women are main sufferers due to lack of toilets. Interestingly, many wealthy families who have bungalows and four wheelers in Indapur have not bothered to construct toilets. The town has become a difficult task for Pune district administration which is aiming to achieve   of 100 percent open defecation free district. 
 
 "We plan to take help of women to convince male members. We had approached political leaders, who refused to intervene saying that they cannot force people to build toilets" said one of the Pune district administration officials.
