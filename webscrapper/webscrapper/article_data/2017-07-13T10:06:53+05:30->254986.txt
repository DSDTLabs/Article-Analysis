SURAT: Bhartiya Bauddha Sangh plans mass re-conversion programme for dalits and tribals, who have embraced Christianity and Islam, in the presence of RSS chief   in Surat on July 30.

 The Sangh started Social Harmony Equality Sankalp Yatra on June 30 from Ahmedabad and would complete it at Somnath on October 30. 
 
 As a part of the yatra, Bhagwat would participate and address a public meeting organized by Bauddha sangh. 
 
 Talking to TOI, national president of Bauddha Sangh, Bante Sanghpriya Rahul said, “We want all our dalits who turned to Christianity and Islam to come back to Buddhism because Buddha symbolises social harmony and unity. More so, Dr   has also said in our Constitution that every person has a right to follow the faith and religion he wants and if he wants to come back to one religion, he can’t be stopped. We are following Indian Constitution by asking dalits to return to Buddhism.”
 
 He said that their survey work was going on to find out how many dalits converted from Buddhism to other religion. “We will appeal to them to come back with love and dignity,” said Rahul. 
 
 Terming the process as   or reconversion, Rahul said, “It is our right to call back all those who deserted us.” 
 
 He also said that Bhagwat’s line of thinking was similar to theirs and so they have invited him to address the event. 
 
 Large number of tribals from Dang, Tapi and Navsari district who have embraced Christianity and Islam would get converted to Buddhism.
