NAGPUR: An entire batch of over 42 Bachelor of   (BCom) final year students from Haribhau Arts and Commerce College, Saoner, couldn’t appear in one of the papers in the summer   following a glitch. With the Vice Chancellor SP Kane expressing helplessness, the students now have no recourse. 

 The students missed their Computerized Accounting paper that was scheduled on March 29. They said they had filled the exam forms and submitted it to the college. But, the college failed to identify that the students had opted for an incorrect subject, said NSUI’s Ashish Mandape. Later when they received the hall tickets, the paper was missing from the list.
 
 On Tuesday, the BCom students had approached Kane seeking his intervention for reconducting of the exam. But, Kane told them that there is no such provision. The students even offered to pay super late fee and fill exam forms again but to no avail. 
 
 Director, Board of Examinations and Evaluation, Neeraj Khaty too citied the same reason.
 
 National Students’ Union of India ( ) vice president Ajith Singh slammed Khaty for giving a long rope to such colleges who continue to go scot free after messing up with exam work. 
 
 NSUI’s Ashish Mandape added that the college has been in the news for all wrong reasons earlier too. “The principal, Virendra Jumde, is tainted and was suspended. Yet, he continues to run the affairs despite several charges against him. It was a clerical error and the BCom students had pointed this out to the college. But they sat on the complaints. Now, the students have no choice but to appear in winter exam,” Mandape said.
