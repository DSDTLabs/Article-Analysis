PANCHKULA: The   (MC) along with   ( ) officials on Tuesday, conducted a demolition drive in the Industrial Area Phase 1 and demolished more than a dozen illegal meat shops running in the area.

 The officials informed TOI that the owners of the shops had already been served notices in which it was clearly mentioned that the meat shops were functional illegally on government land. The department personnel added they had given the shop owners several warnings even in person to remove the encroachments and temporary shops from the area, but all fell on deaf ears. It was also found that they were running the business without any prior permission.
 
 The administrative officials had no other option than demolishing the shops after all their warnings were not heeded by the shop owners. The shops were demolished by a   machine.
 
 Besides this, the officials also removed illegal encroachments near the entry and exit point of the city. Executive officer, MC, O P  , said, “The drive will continue this week and all illegal constructions and encroachments throughout the city will be removed to make the city beautiful.”
 
 Tuesday’s drive has set an example for those sitting on encroached government lands and they must leave or else MC and HUDA will take action accordingly, said officials.
