CHENNAI: A gang abducted a 60-year-old businessman from Tondiarpet and demanded a ransom of RS 80 lakh before abandoning him him on the roadside in   in Vellore district on Thursday.

 The gang scaled down the ransom to Rs 25 lakh for the safe release of  , a resident of Second Street, Nethaji Nagar, and the owner of a furniture store in the locality, before letting him go, police said.
 
 Fakeer failed to return home after going to a mosque at 5am on Wednesday. His son   received a call from an unidentified man at 8am who asked for `80 lakh to release Fakeer.
 
 “Peer said he did not have that much money so the abductors agreed to a payment of Rs 25 lakh,“ a police officer said. “They asked for Rs 3 lakh as an initial payment. Peer lodged a police compliant.“ He said the abductors may have released Faleer because they feared police were tracking them.
 
 A few hours later the Wallajah police called Peer to tell him that they had found his father after his abductors forced him out of a car.
 
 The RK Nagar police is questioning Fakeer to track down the gang.
