As Abhi ( ) is about to kiss Pragya ( ), Dasi rushes in and takes Pragya by her hand to a corner and tells him whatever he saw at the Holi party.
 
  Meanwhile, as Nikhil is about to go inside the house, he sees Dadi looking for the Dhol player who shouted Janki. Nikhil distracts them and goes inside.
  
  Pragya comes inside and tells Janki to go outside to play Holi. Janki also tells them about the man who dropped his moustache. They shift Purab from that room to another room, while Tanu thinks it is her chance to play Holi with Abhi as Pragya is not around. Just then, Nikhil pulls her and tells her that his plan has failed and Dadi is going out looking for him.
  
  Tanu has another plan, according to which she makes Nikhil change his clothes and look entirely different.
  
  
 
  
  While, Pragya and Dasi are shifting Purab from one room to the other, he falls down and gains consciousness. He recognises them. Pragya tells him that someone at the party is trying to kill him.
  
  Purab recalls what had happened on the day of his accident, but doesn't remember the person who hit him with a truck. He asks Pragya to let him go back to Alia's room as it is only then they would get to know about that person's identity.
