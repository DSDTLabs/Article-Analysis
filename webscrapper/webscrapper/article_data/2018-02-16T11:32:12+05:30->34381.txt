The Union Government has released a notification mentioning to extend the age limit for the candidates from Jammu and Kashmir who wish to appear for   organised by the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission). 

 The maximum age limit is 32 years for candidates belonging from general category while for reserved candidates; age relaxation depends from category to category. Though the aspirants belonging from Jammu and Kashmir have had age relaxation already but recently UPSC had removed the age relaxation from its CSE 2018 (Civil Services Exam). 
 
 The Chief Minister of the state, Mehbooba Mufti had raised a concern over the issue some days back. But now the UPSC has amended its notification and decided to give a maximum of five years relaxation to aspiring candidates.
 
 As per the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) order, “The Central Government has decided to extend the age relaxation to all persons who had ordinarily been domiciled in the state of Jammu and Kashmir during the period from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1989 for a further period of two years beyond December 31, 2013,.”
 
 The civil services examination is conducted annually to select IAS, IPS and IFS officers from all over the country. The age extension decision will definitely help thousands of youth belonging from the state aspiring to take   exams.
