THANE: Wildlife rescuers and non government organisations in and around Thane city have come across a number of birds that have fallen victim to kite string cuts. 

 While there has been a growing level of awareness among citizens about the need for keeping the environment in mind while celebrating any festival over the past few years resulting in minimal bird injuries during festivals like  , wildlife rescuers are afraid that this awareness level is dying in various pockets of the city. 
 
 “Last year, we came across only one incident, wherein a pigeon fell prey to a kite string cut. However, this year, we have already seen a number of these bird injury cases, days before the festival. The worst case was that of a bat found entangled in a mesh of kite thread last week. It is now in a critical condition and is to be operated,” said  , founder of animal   PAWS. 
 
 The groups have been spreading awareness through discussions, educational institutions and social media to sensitise the youths about the brutality animals and birds have been facing due to the glass-coated kite strings. “It is impossible to ask people not to fly kites during the festive season. We are reaching out to citizens through social media and mobile applications asking them not to use glass coated strings which injure birds greatly. 
 
 Our volunteers and three ambulances will be taking rounds of the city today to cater to any injured wildlife. We will also be closely monitoring the kite festival in   to prevent any wildlife casualties,” said Bhanage. Aditi Nair, chairperson of Pal NGO in Thane, said, “As wildlife rescuers cannot be everywhere, citizens can play a huge role in rescuing injured birds. 
 
 They should first pick the bird with a cloth and cover it to prevent it from going into a shock and suffering a cardiac arrest. They should then put it in a ventilated cardboard box and take it to the nearest veterinary clinic. These injured birds should not be fed any food or water.”
