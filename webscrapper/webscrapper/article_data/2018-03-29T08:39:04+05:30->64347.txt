HYDERABAD: You don't expect SSC students to be psephologists nor political analysts, but the Board of Secondary School Education, Telangana put them to test on Wednesday, as if they were. Students who appeared for the   2 were stumped when they were to answer a question about the   (TRS).

 “Why did TRS secure more seats in 2014 elections?” was a question students had to answer from data provided to them about the elections results. One would want to guess that those who set the question paper wanted to impress their political masters in the government because answering the question would mean some effort from the students. If they had to answer "Why", the students would certainly have to come up with as much positive information as they could about the TRS which formed the government.
 
 Students had to answer two questions from a table which provided the 2014 election results. The number of seats won by all the parties for the assembly and Lok Sabha seats were provided in the table. The information provided was that TRS won 63 assembly seats and 11 Lok Sabha seats, the   won 21 and 2, the   won 20 and 2 and others won 15 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats.
 
 From this data, students were asked two questions. One question (question no. 4) was: Name the parties that secured more than 15 assembly seats. That could be answered easily as it was the TDP and Congress. But one cannot miss the motive in asking the question as it clearly was to drive into the students that those two parties had won only so many seats. Question no. 5 based on the information provided was, however, not so easy. The question was: "Why did TRS secure more seats in 2014 elections?"
 
 That surely was not taught in the classroom but the students were expected to know.
