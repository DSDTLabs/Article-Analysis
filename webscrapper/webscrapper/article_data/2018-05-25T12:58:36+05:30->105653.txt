MADURAI: Builders Association of India has plans of conducting an eight month internship programme for civil engineering freshers in order to make them industry ready. It has raised apprehensions over the lack of employability of engineering graduates passing out of college and has said that only five per cent of them possess the requisite skills.

  In an attempt to bridge the gap,   will start training programmes in all its 170 centres across the country. Although there are programmes available under the government, it has not addressed the issue completely.
 
 National president of BAI A   said that, a certificate will be issued at the end of the internship. With this, they can easily get employment as they would be trained in various aspects of construction by expert from the industry. A syllabus for this purpose would also be created. He expressed confidence of rolling it out the programme in a yearâ€™s time.
 
 In order to help the contractors and engineers in remote locations with various projects undertaken throughout the nation, BAI plans to introduce a website to spread information. Puhazhendi said that in a few clicks everyone can learn about the projects and take part in the bidding process of the projects they are interested in.
 
 He also said that BAI is ready to train contractors, engineers, architects, technical and non-technical aspirants of construction business by setting up an institute in   preferably in places like Trichy or Madurai. They require at least 10 acres of land to establish the facility. He expressed doubt on whether the state government will come forward to support such an initiative.
