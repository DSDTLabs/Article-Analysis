 in the city found 14   from a house in Wagholi. The snakes were rescued on Wednesday night and were released into their   on Thursday night.

 The snakes were found when Rohit Potdar, an engineering student, was looking for a cricket bat and ball in his house. He said, “Since vacations are on, I was looking for a bat and ball in the house around 8 pm. I was shocked to see four snakes instead. I immediately called up the helpline number and they arrived within 15 minutes.”
 
 The   currently resides in a flat which is next to their old house from where the snakes were found.
 
 The team, on arrival, decided to look around the space, as snakes usually lay eight to 15 eggs. Ravi Lohire, who is a part of the Wildlife Welfare Association (WW), Pune, said, “After we spotted four of them easily, we knew that there would be more snakes. In some time, we found a total of 14 of the Green Keelback baby snakes. They are at the most two days old.”
 
 The   are nonpoisonous. The WWA members tried looking for the female snake that had laid eggs, but weren’t able to trace it. Lohire shared, “The hatching period is around 72 days, and the mating period peaks during January and March.”
 
 Potdar said, “I was scared when I saw four snakes, but was shocked to find 14 of them inside the house. We have cleaned up the entire house after the incident.”
 
 As the temperatures are soaring, the snakes were released into their natural habitat around the city on Thursday night, so that they could get used to the environment and survive on their own better.
 
 The WWA (Pune) in the past three months has rescued 132 snakes, besides 68 birds, four grey langurs, two grey mongoose and seven civet cats.
