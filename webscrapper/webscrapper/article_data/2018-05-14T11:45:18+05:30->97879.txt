CHANDIGARH: Sounds strange, but the fact is that two of the retiring rooms, which were constructed in the Chandigarh railway station, is yet to open for public usage. Interestingly, according to the authorities, the reason behind the delay is the fact that the rates of the retiring rooms are yet to be fixed by the division.

 Sources said after the demand of passengers in the feedback of the passenger amenities committee, two retiring rooms were proposed for the Chandigarh side of the station. With the increase in the number of trains plying from the station, two retiring rooms were in huge demand among the passengers.
 
 Almost eight months ago, the retiring rooms were readied for the passengers and were handed over by the contractor to the railways. But, they have not been opened to the public till date.
 
 The railway station has an old   available for public. The charges of the room are Rs 700 for 24 hours and the passengers are using it on a regular basis. Ignoring the existing rates of the retiring rooms, the authorities are now asking the railways to fix the rates.
 
 Sources said the higher authorities are asking the station authorities to send a report after surveying the cost of the hotels close to the station, so that the rates of these retiring rooms can also fixed on those lines.
 
 In fact, the executive lodge which is for the first class passenger is also open for public free of cost. Sources said as per the railway policy, the executive lodge can be run by the IRCTC or   division. But as the rates are not fixed the division cannot charge the public. As per the policy, passengers have to pay Rs 50 to use the lodge, but at present, it is being used for free.
 
 Hari Deep Kumar, director of Chandigarh railway station, said they have sent the proposal of fixing the rates of retiring rooms to the Ambala division for the final nod. After the same is notified by the authorities, the rooms will be opened for the public.
