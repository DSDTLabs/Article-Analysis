BHOPAL: Proving adage ‘old habits die hard’ right,   (BMC) is employing same   of   at   as was done at Bhanpur for more than four decades. 

 There is absolutely no change in the scene at Adampur Chhhawni, a sleepy village— now the ground zero for new waste dump site for the state capital and surrounding areas. A visit to the site— unskilled labourers working without safety gear as foul odour and dust permeate air for miles in the area, some 15 km on the outskirts of the state capital— confirms fears about vulnerability of those working at the site. 
 
 Dumping at new site began in January. After the multi-crore solid waste management project took off, the BMC announced shutdown of 40-year-old Bhanpur waste dump yard.
 
 An estimated 800 MT to 1000 MT of waste is being dumped each day at the new dump site. Scientific solid waste disposal mechanism is only on paper. “Operation of the solid waste management plant is 2 years away,” said BMC city engineer OP Bhardwaj, who and his team are working 24x7 for the last one week. “New systems have to be introduced. We need to compact waste at waste transfer station and then bring it to Bhanpur,” he said. Compacting of waste would reduce volume of garbage by 50% to 60%, he pointed out.
 
 As of now, technical aspects of change are limited to detailed project report. On Wednesday, a month since dumping began, mountains of garbage can be seen from the main highway. A dusty track of about 2 km from main road leads to the waste dump site. Fertile black cotton soil, considered good from agriculture point of view, is visible on both sides. The track is covered with red stone and soil.
 
 It is difficult not to feel the difference. “When we take a turn to the right, we see a lush green designated as eco-sensitive zone. On the left, far into the village, vehicles carrying garbage pass through the village as children play around unmindful of health problems they leave behind,” said Ram Singh, a farmer.
