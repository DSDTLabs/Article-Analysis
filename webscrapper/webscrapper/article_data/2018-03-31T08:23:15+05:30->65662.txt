LUCKNOW: UP police has decided to deploy 300 policemen at crossings and equip them with gadgets to streamline the city traffic and remove all bottlenecks besides ensuring compliance of traffic rules by commuters. 

 UP director general of police OP Singh convened a high-level meeting on Friday to discuss ways to improve traffic in the city. Senior police officials, including ADG ( ), ADG (traffic), IG ( ), SSP Lucknow and other traffic police officials were present in the meeting.
 
 ADG (Lucknow Zone)   told TOI, "We have asked all officers of the rank of traffic DySPs and traffic inspectors to inspect all crossings in the city and then prepare a detailed report listing the reasons that cause traffic snarls at the particular spot so that they can be dealt with effectively," he said. Around 300 police personnel from across the state will be deployed for this task. 
 
 ADG Krishna further informed that all cops manning the crossings will be given body-worn cameras, torches, jackets and smartphones. These cops will issue instant e-challans to commuters flouting traffic rules. Officials of DySP rank will hold review of crossings under each traffic inspector on a monthly basis and will be monitored by ADG (Lucknow Zone).
 
 IG (Lucknow Range)   said that a number of accident-prone crossings in the city were studied and action plan has been prepared to curb the mishaps. 
 
 Functioning of traffic lights, road-engineering and Zebra crossing will be patterned in co-ordination with LDA and LMC, said Pandey, adding that the project will commence soon. A drive to make motorists aware about traffic signs and rules will be carried out in the first phase itself, said IG Pandey.
