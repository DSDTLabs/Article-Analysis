NEW DELHI:   has enough funds for provisioning and it would be done as per norms, financial services secretary   said on Thursday, while warning that nobody would be spared.

 Talking to reporters, he said the entire amount involved in the fraud would be recovered and the whole plan is part of a cleaning-up exercise. While assuring the safety of the banking sector,   said PNB had not sought any bailout package. “This is not likely to escalate to other banks. We have already frozen the case.” The bank management has also assured that it would emerge stronger from the crisis and had taken prompt steps to contain the damage.
 
 Kumar asserted that the PNB case was an isolated one of a single branch and did not see it spreading.
