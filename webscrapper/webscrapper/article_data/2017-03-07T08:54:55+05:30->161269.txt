NAVI MUMBAI: Cidco has planned a Ro-Ro (roll-on roll-off) service for bigger ocean-going vessels from the passenger water terminal, in the initial stage of development, behind DPS and NRI Colony. The first phase of Rs 111 crore of investment is scheduled for the first boat service from May 2019 to   and Alibaug, the year-end marking the maiden take-off from the second international airport. The inland waterway transport will help decongest SoBo with the around 20-minute ride.

 The Ro-Ro service will link Navi Mumbai with bigger vessels and cargo like transporting four-wheelers, and promises long-distance cruises to Goa and other places.
 
 “There is a plan for expansion factored so that vessels with 350 passenger capacity can dock at the terminal. The dredging of the waterfront in the second phase will ensure the draft required for operating big vessels. The expansion will be done around two years after operations of daily boats from the terminal in phase I of the project,’’ said a Cidco official.
 
 Currently, clearance from the ministry of environment and forests for over 0.46 hectares is being processed. Thereafter, an affidavit will have to be filed in the Bombay high court for compliance. There is a patch of mangroves between the land-end and waterfront which needs to be connected with a bridge and approach roads for the land-end to be connected to the passenger terminal. It will be a 2x2 lane elevated bridge, 650-metre long and 30-metre wide. The approach road will end at the water terminal building, which will have a restaurant, ticket counter and main office. It will have car parking and space for public transport buses.
