 When a fan was asked who her perfect Batman would be, the fan tweeted, "Oh my perfect Batman movie is 'The Santa Clause' with the batsuit where a young black woman, maybe played by Tessa Thompson, accidentally kills Batman and receives a message to put on the suit."
 
 "After a night of crimefighting ends up back at the batcave where Alfred is the Bernard elf character bullies her into taking on the mantle because those are the rules.
 
 "The villain is Jason Todd who wanted the suit for himself which is why he faked his death, because a robin is stuck in his own suit/death cycle and can never take the cowl. Tessa Thompson vs Taylor Kitsch as Jason."
 
 In response, Thompson tagged 'This Is Us' star Sterling J Brown and said, "Let's do this".
