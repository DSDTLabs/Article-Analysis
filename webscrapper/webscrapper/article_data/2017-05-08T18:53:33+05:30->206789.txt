It is celebration time for all the soorma Bhopalis from city of lakes! In the prestigious Swachh Bharat Survekshan this year, the city has jumped from a dismal 105th to coveted 2nd position. After nine months of toil, turmoil and sweeping the streets spotlessly clean the outcome has made the citizens proud as peacock, because as Urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu put it "Its a win for the citizens". With a cloudy cover over the city the mood is celebratory and it is glistening in the glory of victory.   Times took a round of the city and spoke to its denizens young and old as to what the wins means to them.
