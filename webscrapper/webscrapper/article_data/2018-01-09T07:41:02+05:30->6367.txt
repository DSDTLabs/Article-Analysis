KOLKATA: The mercury on Monday slipped further, making it the season’s coldest day so far in the city. With the northwesterly wind gaining strength, the minimum temperature dropped to 10.5°C — marginally lower than Sunday’s 10.6°C. It will continue to remain chilly and windy in Kolkata for at least three more days, the Met office has predicted. The rest of south Bengal continued to experience either a cold wave or cold wave-like conditions.

 “The northwesterly got stronger on Monday, making the chill bite more. It should remain windy for the next 48 hours since there is no obstruction to block the northwesterly. Till the latter flows in, the city will remain cold,” said GK Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC).
 
 With the minimum temperature remaining three degrees below normal, the city continued to experience sub-12°C for the fourth consecutive day. Since Friday, the minimum temperature has been 11.1°C, 11.5°C, 10.6°C and 10.5°C. The chilly spell is the longest since 2013 when the mercury had dropped to 9°C on January 10, the lowest in over 100 years.
 
 Weathermen are not ruling out the possibility of the mercury dropping a shade on Tuesday. But it may not plunge below 10°C. “Since the wind remains strong, the mercury may slide. It fell marginally on Monday and the drop could continue. But it could again be marginal and the chances of a plunge below 10°C are remote. But this is certainly the longest chilly spell since 2013,” said Das.
