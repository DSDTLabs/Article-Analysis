PATNA: As many as 50 horses and elephants, a big fleet of tribal drummers and over 7,000 guests marked the much-hyped wedding of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's son   with former   chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai's granddaughter Aishwarya Rai in Patna on Saturday, which was attended by virtually all the who's who of the country's political circuit.

 Lalu was granted a three-day parole on Thursday to attend his son's wedding and the Jharkhand high court granted him six-week provisional bail the next day on medical grounds. Lalu was so happy that he reportedly told Aishwarya on the phone, You are very auspicious and lucky as everything has started falling in line with your entry into our family" Lalu's family had invited almost all political stars of the country.
 
 
  
  
 
 Prominent among the VVIP guests included former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, Congress veteran Digvijay Singh, NCP leader Praful Patel, Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan, Patna Sahib MP Shatrughan Sinha and Sharad Yadav among others. The most keenly watched interaction was, however, of CM   with Lalu. Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, however, did not attend the wedding. Sources said Lalu's family had sent out over 3,000 invites while arrangements were made for at least over 10,000 persons at the wedding venue.
