NEW DELHI: The sentence review board of   is supposed to meet this week to decide the fate of around 100 inmates. Sources say   is on that list, though there is no official confirmation. 

 Jail sources said the meeting was to be held on Tuesday but had been rescheduled indefinitely amid controversy surrounding Sharma. Rules say only DG Tihar has the power to convene a meeting. 
 
 Sharma has been in ‘open jail’ since last October after director general   took charge in September.
 
 Kashyap did not reply to calls and texts sent by TOI, seeking his comments on the rescheduling of the meeting and whether he had given permission for Sharma being lodged in open jail. Delhi government sources said the home department did receive a notice from the Tihar authorities about the review board meeting, which came to the office of home secretary about five days ago.
 
 But they said they had no information about cancellation of the meeting. When TOI checked, sources confirmed that no review meeting was scheduled on the home secretary’s plan for Tuesday. The procedure says the board meets to recommend sentence omissions and the report goes to the LG for approval.
