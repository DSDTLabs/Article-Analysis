NAGPUR: Though tall claims are being made by the   about better service, Rajdhani passengers are not getting timely help even after lodging complaint.

 In a written complaint, city’s Arvind Gadhikar, retired deputy executive engineer with Khaperkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS) and a resident of  , has lodged a complaint about dirty toilets in 12433 Chennai  , which he boarded on Sunday.
 
 Gadhikar, who was travelling to New Delhi from Nagpur, said, “Around 10pm when I went to the toilet, it was dirty and flush was not functional. I tried lodging a complaint but train ticket examiner (TTE) was not available. I informed attendant but he too did nothing.”
 
 Gadhikar informed about it to his friend, who tweeted the complaint to railway minister. The reply he received reply in 20 minutes from   read, “The inconvenience is regretted apprising matter to officials concerned at Bhopal.”
 
 Some action was expected by Bhopal staff but there too, Gadhikar got no response. He said he had undergone spine surgery and hence uses Western style toilet.
 
 “The worst part is that only one such toilet was available in the coach whose flush was non- operational. Finally, as no corrective action was taken, I lodged written complaint with TTE in another coach,” says Gadhikar.
 
 He says if such problems crop up in premium trains like Rajdhani, one cannot imagine plight of other mail/express trains.
