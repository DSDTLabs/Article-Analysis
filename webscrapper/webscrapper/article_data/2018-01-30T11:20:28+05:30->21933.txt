THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Palakkad-based   has become the latest among the self-financing engineering colleges in the state that has decided to wind up operations. The college has informed   about its willingness to transfer existing students to other institutions.

 
 Kollam-based   was the first institute to seek permission for a similar transfer early this year.
 
 Though some engineering colleges had earlier been denied affiliation or had voluntarily sought exemption from admitting students, many among them later improved their facilities and got back their affiliation. But almost all such institutions are still struggling to fill their seats.
 
 The only college that has not approached the AICTE or KTU for re-affiliation after voluntarily closing down is the   in   district.  , which had lost affiliation, is learnt to have approached the AICTE for permission to convert the institution into a polytechnic college.
 
 “The management of   Institute of Technology has informed that they want to transfer their students to other institutions due to financial crisis being faced by the institution. Hence we have decided to allow the transfer of students to other affiliated institutions (except government/aided colleges) of their choice. The students shall obtain transfer certificate from Aryanet and furnish the same along with the application for the transfer to the college to which transfer is sought,” said a circular issued by university dean (academic) J Sreekumar.
