GANDHINAGAR: Shankersinh Vaghela,   who left the Congress and formed his own party a few months before the   and helped the BJP by splitting Congress votes, denied getting an offer from the BJP to be governor.   did not say whether he would accept such an offer from the BJP or not.

 Rumours of Vaghela being appointed governor of Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu started doing the rounds after the appointment of former Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel as governor of Madhya Pradesh. Vaghela and his former MLA son Mahendrasinh Vaghela, voted for BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections in August 2017 despite being in the Congress at that time. Vaghela’s party also filed candidates of the same caste as the Congress candidates on more than 100 seats, which dented the Congress. However, not a single candidate of Vaghela’s got enough votes to save their deposit.Vaghela said, “I have not been approached by anyone nor have I got an offer to be governor.” About whether he would accept such an offer from the BJP, he said, “I cannot answer such hypothetical questions.”
