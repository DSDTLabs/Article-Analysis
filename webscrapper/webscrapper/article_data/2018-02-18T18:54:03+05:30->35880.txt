*Globalisation is a reality of our times. To keep pace with globalisation, we need top-quality infrastructure.

 
 *Several important projects in India that were announced 20-30 years ago are still stuck in files.
 
 *Several governments came and went, but the airport was not built. The biggest reason behind this is the way a government works.
 
 *Previous governments left projects worth around Rs 10 lakh crore hanging. It was our government that arranged funds for them and ensured they were put on the road to completion.
 
 *We began a 'Pragati' initiative and gave priority to the completion of projects.
 
 *India's aviation sector is growing steadily. There is a sharp increase in the number of people flying.
 
 *A strong aviation sector creates employment and economic opportunities. Better connectivity will give a boost to tourism in India.
 
 *Today around 450 airplanes are currently operational in India, including government and private ones. Within the last year, orders for 900 new airplanes were placed.
 
 *According to a study, investing Rs 100 in aviation will lead to the creation of Rs 325.
 
 *For our government, completing projects within a given time frame is as important as launching new projects. Delayed projects cause several problems.
