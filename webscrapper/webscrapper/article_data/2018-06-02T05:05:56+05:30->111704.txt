COIMBATORE: A consortium of banks led by State Bank of India ( ) has moved the Bengaluru bench of the   ( ), seeking an investigation into the affairs of some of the companies in the United Breweries (UB) Group. Following this, the tribunal has directed the group not to alienate its assets.

 
 The banks said that they hold a recovery certificate issued by the Debt Recovery Tribunal ( ), Bengaluru, against United Breweries Holdings and Kingfisher Finvest, which is worth about Rs 6,250 crore. With interest from the date of suit, the certificate is worth nearly Rs 10,000 crore, the banks led by SBI said.
 
 Under section 213 of the Companies Act, 2013, there is a provision for a shareholder or creditor or any other person to apply to the NCLT and seek an order for an investigation into the affairs of the company. 
 
 Under section 221, creditors can seek freeze orders, which — if passed — will remove the power of the corporate board of the debtor company to alienate properties.
 
 NCLT-Bengaluru, in an order on March 26, restrained the respondent companies (UB Holdings and Kingfisher Finvest) from alienating their assets. “Since the counsels requested time for filing objections and in order to protect the interests of the petitioner banks, it is necessary to give directions to UB Holdings and Kingfisher Finvest that in any event the companies wanted to sell or transfer its assets, they should first obtain prior permission from the tribunal so as to enable the petitioner to file objections,” NCLT said.
