Police sources said that they want to issue the circular to ensure that Dr Mirza does not flee the country. The police are also waiting for a court order to attach Mirza's properties. 

 Mirza (65) has been declared a 'proclaimed offender' by the court and posters declaring him as 'wanted' had earlier been put up in south Mumbai.
 
 Mirza, who has a clinic at  , has been accused in 16 cases of fake caste certificates. Some of the cases are registered at JJ Marg, Bhoiwada, Bandra, Sion, Juhu and   police stations.
 
  When an LOC is issued for a person, all his information is sent to airports in the country and whenever he tries to leave the country at any airport, immigration authorities get an alert and inform the police station concerned.
 
 Mirza had earlier been granted interim relief from court in 14 cases, but the relief was cancelled after he did not attend court.
 
 "The accused has filed a petition in high court, seeking that all cases be clubbed and handed over to one police station or a single agency," said a police officer. The court has asked the city top cop to decide if the cases should be clubbed. "He is not using any cell phone and not at home," said the officer. Mirza's brother, Dr Yaseen, was also arrested for his alleged role in one case. -Mateen Hafeez
