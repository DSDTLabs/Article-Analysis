AHMEDABAD: The old   was demolished and replaced by a new Navrangpura fire station. Built at the cost of Rs 14 crore, the new fire station and the modern quarters of firemen were inaugurated by   on December 25, 2016. 

 Seven months later, as the new fire station faced its first spell of rains, it had such a heavy seepage of water that the firemen, who are called upon to attend to incidents of short-circuit, were wary of the fire station's earthing and feared electrocution themselves. The equipment room containing gadgets worth lakhs of rupees to rescue people had to be taken to a safer place so that it didn't get affected by accumulation of water in the room.
 
 "The firemen were deployed in areas hit by heavy rain. But in their own homes, the situation was not good during the same period. We have pointed out the seepage and the poor quality of construction to senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( ) officials," a fireman said on condition of anonymity.
 
 This, however, is not the only example of a newly built structure getting damaged in the rain. The AMC-built Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay auditorium in Bodakdev - the first such facility in the recently-developed western parts of the city, was equally battered. The infrastructure built, at the cost of Rs 37 crore, has reported heavy leakage on the backstage and on the stage itself. The rain has also affected its electricity supply. Sources said that a glitch was found when the seepage affected stage lights during an ongoing performance which had to be halted.
 
 AMC officials said they are yet to assess the damage caused by the heavy rains to AMC-run properties. Damage to other performance halls and public buildings has also been reported, sources said. They further said that an audit is likely about the quality of construction when the roads and other infrastructure is already facing construction.
