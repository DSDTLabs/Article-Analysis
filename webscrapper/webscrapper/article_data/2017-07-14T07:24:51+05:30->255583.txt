HYDERABAD: Tucked into a small space at   crossroads, the   shop has no presence online, no branches and no plans to expand. But that has not kept it from drawing hordes of customers looking to buy soft, fluffy breads for as many as 166 years! Currently run by the fifthgeneration descendent of its founder, the naan outlet in   prides itself for remaining unchanged in terms of service and quality for more than a century. “There has never been any compromise on the quality and taste of the naan,“ says Khaja  . An engineering student by day , the 19-year-old runs the family business when his father is away.

 It was in 1851, during the rule of the fourth Nizam Bahadur Asif Jah that Razak's ancestor Mohammed Hussain Saheb set up the shop. Hussain Saheb was working at the Nizam's of fice as a Munshi (accounts clerk). Thus, when it came time to name the shop, he did not venture far, naming it simply `Munshi's Naan'.
 
 Since then, the name has stuck and has come to be associated with the special naan they make. The bread costs a couple of rupees more than what is charged in other shops, but the unending stream of customers vouch for the fact that they get their money's worth. The naan reportedly stays soft for three days and fresh batches are prepared by the workers thrice a day.
 
 Asked why they never tho ught of expanding the business all these years, Razak only has a contented one-liner as answer. “We are content as we are,“ he tells TOI.
 
 Though there is some space on the verandah in front of the shop for customers to sit and enjoy the naan with curry , the owners prefer people taking the delicacy home with them.Though there were plans of shifting the shop to a different location earlier to a more spacious premises, it was shelved. The shop still retains its old world charm and is likely to do so for many more generations to come.
