The sweltering   heat is taking a toll on Mumbaikars. With temperatures in the city lingering at around 40 degrees, city doctors are advising Mumbaikars to take precautions in order to save themselves from falling prey to heat strokes. Dr PM  , president of   says, “Heat stroke is one of the most serious forms of heat injury and not many are aware that it is a medical emergency.”

 
 
 It is a serious medical condition where the body temperature reaches 104°F or above. It may lead to complications involving many internal organs and systems. Dr Pushpa S, a homeopathy practitioner, says, “Usually when a person suffers a heat stroke, the symptoms are throbbing headache, red, hot, and dry skin, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and light-headedness, muscle weakness or cramps, lack of sweating despite the heat, rapid heartbeat and shallow breathing, behavioural changes such as confusion, disorientation, or staggering, seizures and unconsciousness.”
 
 
 
 Doctors suggest that in order to dodge a heat stroke people should avoid being out in the sun for long. 
 Drink at least three litres of water daily. Also, have a glass of fruit or vegetable juice and an electrolyte-rich sports drinks. 
 Monitor the colour of your urine — darker urine is a sign of dehydration. 
 Do not have caffeinated drinks or alcohol, because they make you lose fluid and worsen heat-related illness. 
 
 
 
 Dr Bhujang says, “In case of a heat stroke, directly pour water on the person, immerse them in a tub of cold water, or put ice cubes to the patient’s armpits, groin, neck, and back to cool down the body. Meanwhile, one must call the ambulance.”
 
 
 
 If you suffer from exertional heat stroke (it happens while exercising vigorously) an ice bath can help cool the body.
