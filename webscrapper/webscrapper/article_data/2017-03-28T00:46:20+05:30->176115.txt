Chennai: Generation 67 (G67), a forum started by former Union finance minister P Chidambaram’s son   launched a campaign in the   constituency, urging voters not to accept bribes. The byelection is due in R K Nagar on April 12.

 “Our volunteers will go door-to-door like political parties but instead of seeking votes we will seek people’s signature on a pledge not to take money for voting for a particular party,” said Karti launching the campaign at V O C Nagar, Tondiarpet.
 
 The volunteers numbering more than 500 will knock on the doors of voters across the constituency in the next 15 days and campaign against corruption in elections. “This is a first step of the forum and we are not saying that we will eradicate use of money power in elections but we are aiming to make an impact in the minds of people about not selling their votes for money,” said Karti.
 
 The forum did not have anything to do with the Congress party. Karti is a member of the All India Congress Committee. “The aim of the forum is not to be a letter pad organisation but work pro-actively on issues affecting the state and its people. We will ensure that we complete our task in R K Nagar,” said Karti.
