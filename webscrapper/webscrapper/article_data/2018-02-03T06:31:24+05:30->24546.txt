KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission ( ) directed   (BMBHRC) to pay Rs 20 lakh as compensation to the family of a patient who died during treatment. The commission took up the case after Koushil Pal, the patient’s son, knocked its doors.

 Patient Arti Pal was admitted in the hospital on May 3 with complaints of chest pain, respiratory distress and fever. Pal was shifted to CMRI on May 8 as her condition deteriorated. She died the same day and the family cried medical negligence. 
 
 During the course of addressing the complaint, the commission found discrepancies in the submission by the hospital authority and documents relating to the treatment. While the hospital authority submitted that the patient’s condition was deteriorating and hence shifted to CMRI, the discharge certificate mentioned that the patient was discharged in stable condition. 
 
 The health panel also found the doctor who had conducted the Echo screening did not possess the qualification from an institute recognized by either the MCI or the  . Even the technician who had assisted in the procedure was not qualified for the job.
 
 “Considering the lapses on part of the hospital, degree in deficiency in service, irrational and unethical trade practice coupled with mental shock, pain and harassment suffered by the complainant and family members, we fell it would be justified if Rs 20 lakh is awarded as compensation to the son,” said the order signed by Justice  , chairperson of the commission along with six members.
 
 ”We have received the order and will take necessary next steps,” said a release from BM Birla.
