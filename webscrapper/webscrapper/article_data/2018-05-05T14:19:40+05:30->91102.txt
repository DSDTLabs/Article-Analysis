Panaji:   national president   is expected to address around 12,000 booth-level party workers for two hours on the evening of May 13 at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee indoor stadium, state BJP president   said. He also said chief minister   would continue to guide the party even if he was not present during the meeting.

 Tendulkar challenged Goa Pradesh   Committee ( ) president Girish Chodankar’s statement that the BJP-led government should be disqualified and asked him to state the provisions under which this should be done. Taking a dig at Chodankar, who lost to Parrikar in the 2017 byelections, he said nobody was interested in standing for elections on the Congress ticket in Panaji.
 
 The state BJP president also said the government was not aware of the ‘adopt a heritage’ scheme and told reporters that he has asked the Centre for more information on the scheme. Defending the scheme nevertheless, he said that it wouldn’t privatise any monuments but would merely provide services to tourists, including changing rooms and parking provisions. 
 
 Chodankar had alleged that the government was aware of the ‘adopt a heritage’ proposal and that it had recommended names of the Bom Jesus Basilica and the Aguada jail to the Union ministry of tourism. He had also stated that he would release evidence to prove the tourism department and the archives and archaeology department were informed about the Centre’s plan for Goa’s heritage sites.
