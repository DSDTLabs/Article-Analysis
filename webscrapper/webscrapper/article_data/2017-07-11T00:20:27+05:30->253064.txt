Kolhapur:   merchants organised a march in the textile town of Ichalkaranji against the goods and services tax ( ) on Monday.

 A five day bandh has been imposed by the merchants since Saturday. The textile business is losing Rs 100 crore everyday as the merchants have stopped procuring cloth and garments prepared by mill owners.
 
 The merchants have given the government an ultimatum: either to resolve the issue by Wednesday or they will go on indefinite strike.
 
 Ugamchandh Gandhi, president of power loom merchants association, while addressing the protesters said, "The protest is against the complexities in GST. We want a simple tax system which can be easily dealt with by small traders. The process to file returns and keep documents for a long time is cumbersome work and will affect small traders. Also, the government has proposed stringent punishment even for trivial mistakes in filling the returns."
 
 The march started from Gandhi Putala Chowk. Commission agents, associations related to transport and mill operators also participated in the protest march.
 
 A delegation of protesters met block development authorities and asked them to convey their sentiments to the government. The petition that was given to the office states that no trader is ready to embrace the new indirect tax system.
 
 "Traders have no internet connection, no computers and no operators which are required to file monthly returns to tax authorities. Traders will not be able to afford the fees for professional accountants. Three returns need to be filed every month. We demand that we be allowed to file returns once every three months," reads the petition.
 
 After implementation of GST, major textile markets across the country, such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhiwandi and Malegaon are shut down demanding roll back of measures related to filling tax returns. As of now, the bandh in Ichalkaranji has affected 80% of business.
