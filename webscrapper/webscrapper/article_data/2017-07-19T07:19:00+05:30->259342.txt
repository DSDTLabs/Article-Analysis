Chandigarh: Conceding their long-pending demand, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday approved cash grant instead of land for war widows. The policy change will be applicable for dependants of martyred soldiers besides permanently disabled soldiers of 1962 Indo-China War, 1965 Indo-Pak War and widows of 1971 Indo-Pak War.

 Amarinder has sanctioned a grant of Rs5 lakh in lieu of one acre of land, with maximum of Rs 50 lakh for 10 acres.
 
 He also directed the Sainik Welfare department to expedite the disbursement of the cash to provide the war widows with the much-needed relief, adding that he is committed to the welfare of war widows, as well as ex-servicemen.
 
 Amarinder has started connecting with all the war widows and ex-servicemen in the state on a personal level through demi-official letters. The chief minister has been writing letters to them, inquiring about their well-being since he took over the reins of the state.
 
 The chief minister has also set up a special ex-serviceman cell in the CMO. He has also directed the civil and police officials to extend full respect, assistance and recognition to ex-servicemen in the state.
