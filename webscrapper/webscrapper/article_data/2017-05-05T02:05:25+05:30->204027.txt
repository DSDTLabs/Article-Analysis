NOIDA: The   government had paid Rs 21.15 lakh to a few   to argue against a   against the tainted ex-chief engineer of Noida Authority, Yadav Singh, two years ago. This has been revealed in a reply to an   application filed by a Lucknow-based activist, Dr Nutan Thakur.

 Speaking to TOI from Lucknow, Thakur said the Allahabad high court had ordered a CBI inquiry into the multi-crore Yadav Singh scam on the basis of a petition filed by her in December 2014. Thakur had accused Singh of amassing property disproportionate to his known sources of income. The  , however, filed an appeal against the high court order in the Supreme Court. The apex court dismissed the appeal on the first hearing itself on July 16, 2015. According to Thakur, the Akhilesh government left no stone unturned to skirt a CBI inquiry. 
 
 Earlier this year, Thakur filed an RTI application seeking information on the appeal filed in the Supreme Court against the high court order. As per the reply given by Surendra Pal Singh, special secretary, Nyay Anubhag-1 on May 4, 2017, four senior lawyers were engaged by the state government in the Supreme Court. Of these, Kapil Sibal was given a fee of Rs 8.8 lakh, Harish Salve Rs 5 lakh, Rakesh Dwivedi Rs 4.05 lakh and Dinesh Dwivedi was given Rs 3.3 lakh, making it a total of Rs 21.15 lakh. “It is truly amazing that the state government had wasted such a huge amount to save a tainted person like Yadav Singh,” Thakur said. “This public money should be immediately recovered from the pocket of the concerned public authorities,” she demanded.
 
 Yadav Singh is currently behind bars in the corruption case being probed by CBI. In January this year, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also attached his assets worth nearly Rs 20 crore in a money laundering case filed against Yadav Singh. The ED had booked Singh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in two separate cases in 2015.
