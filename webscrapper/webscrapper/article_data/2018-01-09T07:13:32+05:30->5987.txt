BENGALURU: Namma   witnessed heavy rush on Monday morning, forcing Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) to operate additional trains and short-loop trips. A whopping 44,356 passengers travelled on Metro trains between 9.30am and 10.30am, the highest ridership recorded in an hour during peak time.

 While the Purple Line between   and Byappanahalli saw 29,549 users, the figure for   stood at 14,807, said UA Vasanth  , chief public relations officer, BMRCL.
 
 Rao said 16 trains were operated from Byappanahalli to Mysuru Road, with a frequency of 3.5 minutes. Five short-loop services were run between Majestic and Byappanahalli. “Usually, 13 trains and four short-loop services are operated. The previous highest ridership for the corresponding period was about 40,000,” said Rao.
 
 He said many officegoers prefer the Metro to avoid heavy traffic congestion between 9.30am and 10.30am, attributing this to the increasing ridership during peak hours.
 
 Commuters have been asking BMRCL to increase the frequency and number of coaches. The Purple Line (East-West corridor) is expected to get the first train with six coaches — one will be reserved for women — by the month-end.
