PANAJI: Even as allies   (MGP) withdrew support to the   on Thursday and closed the possibility of a pre-poll alliance, the BJP has kept its options for a post-poll alliance with its   open.

 Questioned as to whether the BJP is ruling out the possibility of post-poll alliance with the MGP, chief minister   said, “It is not my nature to say I don’t want this one or that one.”
 
 Parsekar told TOI that even his worst critic in the assembly would not have a problem if he is the chief minister. “I haven’t got personal or played politics of vengeance,” he said.
 
 “What will happen in politics cannot be predicted. It depends on circumstances,” BJP MP Narendra Sawaikar said when asked about a post-poll tie-up with the MGP.
 
 Sawaikar, choosing not to react to the MGP’s criticism of the BJP over the last few week, said, “All I can say is that we had an alliance for four-and-a-half years. We have not criticised one another to score points politically. Every party has its own style of functioning. They have the right to put their views forward.” 
 
 MGP has been repeatedly hitting out at the BJP stating that senior BJP leadership made no attempts to address their grievances during the alliance. “MGP is an independent party and has the freedom to decide, and has decided accordingly,” Sawaikar said of the MGP withdrawing support to the government on Thursday.
