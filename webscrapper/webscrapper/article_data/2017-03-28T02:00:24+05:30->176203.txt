PATNA: Even as the proposed power tariff hike for 2017-18 has led to an outcry, the annual audit report of CAG released on Monday said the BERC (Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission)-approved tariff rates of Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited remained constant from 2011 to 2016 as tariff petitions were not submitted by the company owing to its failure to finalise the annual accounts since 2001-02.   As a result, the Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited (BSHPCL)’s sale price at Rs.2.49 per unit was less than even the average power purchase cost of power distribution companies (discoms), which was Rs. 4.12 per unit for the period 2015-16.    The CAG report says the BERC, while approving the power tariff for 2009-10, had directed the BSHPCL to furnish duly audited annual book of accounts in future, failing which it would not accept the tariff petition.    According to the report, even if the BSHPCL succeeds in obtaining BERC’s approval for its tariff on a par with the prevailing average power purchase cost of discoms, it will never be in a position to attain the break- even point to become commercially viable.
