BENGALURU: The   on Sunday dropped its controversial candidate for Madikeri, H S Chandramouli, who represented elusive diamond merchant   as his lawyer, and fielded K P  , a Vokkaliga and sister of Kannada actor Jai Jagadish, from the constituency. The party, however, chose to go with another controversial candidate, N A Haris, and issued him a B form to contest from Shantinagar in Bengaluru city.

 The candidature of Chandramouli, a former state public prosecutor, had led to Congress coming under intense criticism from the BJP, which alleged that Choksi enjoyed the patronage and support of Rahul Gandhi and his party.
 
 BJP’s reaction came after Congress spokesperson Brijesh Kalappa, who was denied the party ticket, put out a cryptic message on Twitter: “I have never represented Mehul Choksi nor have I been given the party nomination.’’ Chandramouli was Choksi’s advocate when he moved the   high court in 2016 against the state government and S V Hariprasad, a city-based businessman who had filed a cheating case against Choksi.
 
 The party also confirmed ticket to sitting MLA N A Haris, whose son Mohammed Nalapad Haris is now in judicial custody in connection with an attempt to murder case.
 
 On Sunday, the Congress released its third and final list of candidates for five constituencies. The party has announced candidates for 223 of the 224 constituencies in the state. It is supporting late farmer leader KS Puttannaiah’s son Darshan Puttannaiah, a Swaraj India Party candidate, in Melukote.
 
 The party’s final list of candidates also includes D B Inamdar from Kittur, Vithal Dhonidiba Katakdhond from Nagthan, Mallanna Niganna Sali from Sindgi and Sayed Yasin from Raichur.
