JAIPUR: In order to accommodate extra passengers, the luxury   'Palace on Wheels' (POW) had to be attached with a coach from the '  on Wheels' (HPOW), an older luxury train, on Wednesday. This is for the first time in the train's history that it has been overbooked. 

 The POW was overbooked with 84 passengers against its capacity of 82 heads, for which, a yellow coach from the 30-year-old HPOW - which was the first luxury train of   also called old POW - had to be attached to the blue POW for its itinerary to run as per schedule.
 
 "It was a herculean task to club two trains... for the first time in the history of the train, we had to request the Railway's permission to attach one extra coach from the HPOW. Since the railways don't allow more than 24 coaches in a train, we requested for just one additional coach to be attached to the 22-coach POW," said  , consultant general manager of POW. The HPOW, incidentally, was parked at Delhi as its next trip is scheduled for January 26, 2018. 
 
 The tourists are mostly Americans on this seven-day trip, said Bohra.
 
 
 
 
 
 Bohra added that the extra tourists have booked for single occupancy, so three cabins out of the seven in the added coach would be occupied.
 
 “In the financial year of 2016-17, the train ran on 46% occupancy. During 2017-18, we ran two tours with only 27 passengers on board. This year, however, the backlog of fewer tourists is expected to clear and we’re hoping to touch a minimum occupancy of 50% by the end of this season,” Bohra said.
 
 In operation since 2008 and touted as India's most luxurious train, the POW can accommodate a maximum of 82 passengers at a tariff of 650 USD per person per night. Only nine years old, it boasts of superior luxury and more facilities than the HPOW. Originating and concluding in Delhi, the itinerary of the train takes you through Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bharatpur.
