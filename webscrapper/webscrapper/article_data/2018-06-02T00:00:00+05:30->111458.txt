There is no stopping this little bundle of talent. Thirteen-year-old Belagavi boy  , who hails from  , a small village situated around 40 km from the Belagavi, won the hearts of people across the state after emerging as the winner of   Lil Champs Season 14. Vishwaprasad has bagged over 30 singing titles, including in Ede Tumbi Haduvenu and the Tamil version of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. We caught up with the teenage wonder for a quick chat upon his return to his hometown. Excerpts…

 
 
 My friends, school mates and teachers are all very happy. When I went to school (Holy Cross Convent School in Bidi village) on Wednesday (May 30), all my classmates gathered around me to wish me and talk to me. The school is also going to felicitate me.
 
 
 
 I used to rehearse for 1-2 hours in the morning and evening earlier, and used to study after 7 pm. I am going to Class 9 this year, so the focus on academics will be more. Like I did earlier, I will spend time on weekends with my guru Gururaj Mirajkar, with who I practice Hindustani music.
 
 
 
 It helped me a lot, since it made me confident to be on stage and tune well with new musicians. However, I faced tough competition from other contestants this time. I never lost focus on my singing throughout the journey of the show, which, I think, helped me bag the title.
 
 
 
 The title has made me popular in every house across  . The other day, when I went to eat Pani Puri at chaat centre in Belagavi, I saw several people looking at me and talking about me. They even came up to me and wished me. I speak to everyone who approaches me; I love it when people surround me.
 
 
 
 Not autographs, but a lot of young people do take selfies with me.
 
 
 
 Not yet, as I have just won the title. But I have got chance to perform in  , where I will be going with   sir.
