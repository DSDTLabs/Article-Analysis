NEW DELHI: Killing his   was perhaps the culmination of a series of criminal acts that had seen Mohammad Adil being   four times in the past year and a half. As such, encounters with the cops werenâ€™t anything new for the youth, having been just 17 years old when he first stole a bike.

 It was on stolen bikes that Adil, posing as Luv Kumar, took  , the girl he stabbed to death on Wednesday, on rides. In fact, when arrested in Madhu Vihar in 2016, it was Gautam who had called a friend to bail Adil out. After every run-in with the law, Adil would drive to Aligarh and return to the capital after matters cooled. 
 
 Some sources believe that Adil, 25, also acted as an informer for the cops. The part-time cabbie lost his father Banne Khan when he was still an infant and was raised by his mother Mohseena and stepfather Riazuddin, who works at a garage in Shahdara.
 
 After Gautam ended their relationship, Adil saw her with a Shahdara youth at a mall. There was a scuffle in which Adil suffered wounds inflicted by a knife and broken bottle. Cops questioned him about the injuries, but he refused to register a complaint. He sent an emotional text message to the girl about his injuries, which she ignored, infuriating Adil. He was also angry that she refused to return the phone he had gifted her. In March, when he threatened to attack her family members, Gautam approached the police.
