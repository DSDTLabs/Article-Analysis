KOLKATA:   wanted to bring in   as soon as possible but the star striker is still awaiting the required paperwork to come back and play in India. 

 
 “Chidi has agreed to all our terms and conditions and his contract is also ready but his visa hasn’t been approved yet,” said a source close to the team management.
 
 Not only the AFC Cup, the team wanted Chidi for the last few matches of the I-League too, in the hope that he will help them finish fourth. But now it’s not certain as when he can join the team. 
 
 Moreover, even if Chidi does arrive before their home match against   on Friday, there will not be much that he can do to help them finish fourth.
