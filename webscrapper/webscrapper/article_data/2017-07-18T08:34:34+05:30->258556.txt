MUMBAI: The   has sought an explanation from its former   Vishwas Patil after TOI’s report last week on clearances given by him to an irregular   proposal at M P Mill   near Imperial Towers.

 Patil cleared the proposal on June 23rd, two days after it was sanctioned by housing minister Prakash Mehta. After TOI’s queries on the matter, Chief Minister Devendra   stayed it on July 11th.
 
 Officials said that Patil had been asked to provide details on the reasons why he cleared the proposal. “Based on the information received, the department will decide whether to probe this further,” a senior official said.
 
 Separately, a committee has been set up to examine the clearances given by Patil during his last week in office, after reports that a large number of files had been cleared in the last few days of his tenure. Patil has denied that the number of files cleared were above the ordinary. Patil retired on June 30th.
 
 TOI’s had reported on Mehta and Patil clearing the proposal which allowed extra building rights granted to slum-dwellers at the MP Mill Compound in   to be transferred to a scheme for project affected people (PAP), a move which goes against development control (DC) norms. The decision would generate additional building rights worth over Rs 500 crore to be sold on the market for the developer S D Corporation.
 
 There is no provision in the DC rules which allows benefits granted to eligible slumdwellers to be withdrawn or transferred, the housing department had said. In fact, the housing department’s note to the SRA CEO in June said he should decide on the proposal within the boundaries of the DC rules.
 
 Patil went ahead and granted his approval. However, the file came under scrutiny before a Letter of Intent (LOI) could be issued. Officials say that once the LOI is issued, staying a scheme is much more difficult.
