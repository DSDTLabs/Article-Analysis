. (You’ve earned a lot through cheating. Now it's time to pay up),” begins a   issued to 10 jewellers in  . Delivered in the early hours of Wednesday, the letter puts forth a demand of Rs 10 lakh to each. CCTV cameras captured a masked man arriving on motorbike and sliding the letter under the shutters of the stores.

 
 Typed in Hindi, the letter was sealed in a brown envelope. It stated that the notes submitted should be in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000, with each denomination arranged in four bundles. Crucially, what it did not say is how the money was supposed to be delivered or collected by the extortionist.
 
 
 A jeweller told TOI the letter indicated that the person could be a petty thief or a drug addict. But the police have not ruled out the involvement of a disgruntled staffer. The jewellery stores which received the letter are big names: Shri Ganesh, Bharti, Samrat, Navrang, Maniratnam, Gajanti, and Gauri.
 
 
 Ajeweller said the community was not taking the threat seriously and was going about business as usual. Nevertheless, a few jewellers in the   region have approached the Nalasopara police and registered a case of extortion under section 385 of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 
 The police said that though most jewellery showrooms have CCTV cameras, the images of the letter’s deliverer are not very clear. An officer said jewellery stores in the region did not usually have security guards posted outside their shutters during the night.
