NEW DELHI: A day after the   directed the Centre-appointed special task force to seal unauthorised constructions in central Delhi's   and remove encroachments in front of shops for unobstructed passage for the people, representatives of the traders' association said they would meet the   chairman on Thursday. 

 The apex court asked the 13-member STF to identify illegal constructions and encroachments in Khan Market and take immediate action against shop owners. The court passed the order after the court-appointed monitoring committee told the bench that various shops in the market had encroached upon the verandah, causing hardship to visitors. The committee accused NDMC of protecting shop owners by refusing to remove the encroachments. 
 
 Sanjiv Mehra, president of  ' association, said on Wednesday: "We do not understand why Khan Market is being targeted. This is the only market where we have footpaths that are not encroached upon. We want to understand the nature of such encroachments and unauthorised construction (that SC has asked to be removed)."
 
 Mehra said on the directions of the monitoring committee, portions of 24 units were sealed in January. "When they carried out a drive in January, why wasn't the issue addressed then? We will meet the NDMC chairman and seek to know what violations the traders have made," he said. 
 
 An NDMC official told TOI that they would meet STF to outline a plan to carry out SC's orders. "We will examine the court order, and in consultation with STF, initiate action," a senior NDMC official said. 
 
 A plan to redevelop Khan Market has remained on paper for long. It was proposed to develop a walkway on the second floor, which was to be connected with a skywalk that would also act as a fire escape route.
