THANE: The coffers of the   saw a neat rise of nearly 13% last fiscal as compared to the previous years. An increase in   tax, revision of water   and good response to the additional preminum   launched by the state governemtnsince 2015 helped civic chief Sanjeev Jaiswal add the desired quantum of revenue to the TMCâ€™s kitty.

 The income recorded by the corporation for the financial year 2016-17 stands at Rs 2,041 crore, which is higer than the revenue target of Rs 2,004.9 crore. The administration had managed to shore in around Rs 1,788 crore in 2015-16. The amount may increase further as the administration is yet to add up taxes collected from some departments.
 
 The top money spinners for the   are the property tax and town planning department that have contributed Rs 376 crore and Rs 642 crore, respectively. The town planning department that relies on income from development charges and other permissions to be taken for initiating a realty project has been largely benefited by the additional FSI scheme launched in September 2015. The department earned Rs 117 crore through the sale of additional premium FSI scheme as against the desired target of Rs 100 crore.
 
 Meanwhile, around 1.25 lakh property tax owners contributed Rs 376 crore to the civic kitty last fiscal. Officials said that the collections from this department is good as the recovery is close to the target of Rs 390 crore.
 
 The local body tax department collected Rs 159 crore this fiscal. Though, LBT was abolished for a majority from August 2015 leaving only those with an annual turnover of Rs 50 crore and above under its ambit, the state has been compensating the civic bodies with grants that helped the TMC gain Rs 483 crore.
 
 In contrast, the public works department and   supply team reportedly failed to add more revenue to the civic coffers. As against its Rs 127 crore earnings in 2015-16, the public works department managed to garner Rs 102 crore, which is 20% less revenue in 2016-17. However the department has surpassed its target set for the fiscal by nearly Rs 36 crore this year. However, few activists remain unimpressed by the statistics and said while the recovery of taxes was at an all time high, the quality of living in the city hasn't improved a bit in comparison.
