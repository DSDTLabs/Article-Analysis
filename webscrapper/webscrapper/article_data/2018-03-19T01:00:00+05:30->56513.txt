When Dheeraj Dhoopar and Vinny Arora glammed up for a photoshoot recently, their idea was to capture some sizzling moments as a couple. However, just as the cameras were going click-click, the actor decided to turn photographer himself. And guess who turned Dheeraj’s muse for that? His wife Vinny.

 Dheeraj, who is currently seen on ' ', says, “Not many know that I have a strong liking for photography. I have always wanted to click Vinny and I found that particular day perfect for it. We had actually planned a couple photoshoot. But when the floor was being set, I saw Vinny sitting on the sofa, looking fabulous with the light falling on her face. I immediately told her to freeze, ran for my camera and started clicking her. The results were amazing. I have been clicking Vinny casually, but that day was special.”
