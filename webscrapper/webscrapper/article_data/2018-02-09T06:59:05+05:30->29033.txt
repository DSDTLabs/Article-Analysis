KOLKATA: After nabbing  , the brother-in-law of   airman   (50), and his two aides for allegedly stealing foreign and Indian currency worth around Rs 10.5 lakh, the   police also returned Mondal the money he needed for the kidney transplant of his 20-year-old critically ill son. 

 "We took barely 30 hours to nab the accused after Mondal told us how he had arranged the money for his son's kidney transplant and dialysis. We came to know that Mondal's son Md Tarique Hassan was to undergo dialysis again and they were in dire need of money. A seizure list first needs to be put up in court for its nod before returning the stolen property to its rightful owner. But under such circumstances, Mondal had to wait for around 48 to 72 hours. Hence, we released the entire money based on personal bond," said a senior officer from East division police. The documents, verifications for which has already been completed by the police, will be returned soon," claimed a source.
