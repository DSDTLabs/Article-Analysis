NEW DELHI: Two  , aged six months and six years, respectively, were found   by their   in their house at Zakhira in west Delhi early this week. Both had strangulation marks on the neck. 

 On Tuesday evening, the parents called the police after finding the unconscious girls in their one-room house in Moti Nagar. The girls were declared brought dead in a nearby hospital. A murder case was registered and the bodies were sent to   for an autopsy.
 
 A preliminary probe has revealed that the girls used to stay in the house when their parents would go out to work. Their mother works as a domestic help while the father is a daily wage labourer. The couple’s third daughter was saved as she had gone to a neighbour’s house during the incident.
 
 Investigating officers indicated that someone known to the family might have killed the girls due to some enmity with their father. He has been questioned to find out if he recently had a fight with anyone or if there is any ongoing feud within the family. The possibility of a sexual assault has also not been ruled out, said a source. 
 
 The neighbours, many of whom were present at home at the time of the incident, are also being questioned to find a clue. Although the neighbours claimed that they did not see anyone leaving the house, some of them have been detained. 
 
 The CCTV footage of the area is also being scanned to figure out if any outsider had come to the area in the afternoon. 
 
 DCP (west) Vijay Kumar was not available for comments.
