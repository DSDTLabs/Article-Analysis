NOIDA: Officials of the   on Wednesday said no decision has been taken yet on increasing   tariff. “No final figure is ready for a proposed tariff hike in water rates,” S C Arora, senior project engineer of Noida Authority, told TOI on Wednesday. This came after a news report stated that there would be a likely 160% rise in water tariff soon.   denied the figure. 

 Private firm   and Young has been hired to tabulate the existing water connections and an impending increase following the growth in population and increased realty possessions. 
 
 “Any tariff increase will only be finalised in the next financial year — after March 2018 — after studying the report which is yet to be submitted by Ernst and Young. Currently they are collecting data from neighbouring areas as well as across Noida. They are likely to submit their report by March first week,” Arora told TOI. 
 
 Though Arora admits that the Authority is mulling an increase in water tariff after March 2018, nothing is final yet. “We have not given any figure as of now for increase in tariff rates for water,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, residents opposed the proposed tariff hike citing poor quality and quantity of the water supplied. They demand corrective steps be taken before the traiff is increased.
