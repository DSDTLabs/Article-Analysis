NEW DELHI: He doesn't know about a 'mahagathbandhan', or a 'grand alliance', but   leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today said that an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) "under  's leadership" in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls is indeed on the cards.

 "You will hear details in 24-36 hours," Azad said.
 
 Separately but concurrently, the Congress party's   said she will withdraw from being the projected Uttar Pradesh chief ministerial candidate if a Congress-SP alliance does come to fruition.
 
 In a Congress-SP alliance in UP, there is no doubt current chief minister Akhilesh will be the projected chief ministerial candidate.
 
 "Will withdraw from CM candidature if Congress-SP alliance happens. There cannot be two CM candidates. Talks are on about SP-Congress alliance, it will benefit Uttar Pradesh. I will do what the high command decides," Dixit said, according to ANI.
 
 Azad further underscored that any alliance with the SP will be "under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav", who yesterday was awarded the use of the SP's electoral symbol, the 'cycle'.
 
 
 "As of now it is alliance of Congress and SP, will think about 'maha-gathbandhan' in coming days," Azad said without elaborating on who else might join a 'grand alliance' if one were formed. A similar 'grand alliance' in   - between the JD (U), the RJD and the Congress - convincingly kept the BJP out of power there. 
 
 In Uttar Pradesh, the scenario appears to have gotten complicated since the rift in the SP deepened. The Election Commission awarded the 'cycle' to the Akhilesh faction, and it could be said he scored over party supremo Mulayam's faction, but the fact remains that the rift has left the UP race up in the air.
