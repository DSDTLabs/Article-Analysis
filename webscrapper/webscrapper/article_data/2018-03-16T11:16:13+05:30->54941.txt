MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court directed the legal services authority of   district to inspect whether sand is quarried in the name of savudu (a kind of soil available in the upper layer of the earth near water body), from the banks of Gundaru river. 

 A division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan gave this direction on a public interest litigation filed by P   from Virudhunagar. 
 
 When the case came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel told the court that two people – M Pandiramanagulu and  , are involved in illegal sand quarry activities in the banks of Gundaru river. 
 
 For their business, the duo entered into a lease agreement with the people having land near the river and then obtained permission from the district authorities to quarry ‘savudu’ from the said land. But, they quarried sand using machineries in   and   villages, by misusing the permission. The officials who are supposed to inspect the same and take action against the illegal quarry operations, did not take action in that regard, the counsel said. 
 
 The counsel also said that the court could ascertain the truth by inspecting the sites by appointing an advocate commissioner. The counsel appearing for the government said that no sand quarry activity was taking place . 
 
 Following it, the court directed the inspection by district legal services authority and adjourned the case to April 16.
