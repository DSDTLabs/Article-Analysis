Surat: A 33-year-old man was convicted of rape of two seven-year-old girls and sentenced to 10 years in prison by a local court on Monday. The accused used to show obscene videos to the girls and molested them for over a month at his residence.

 Arjun Lohar, a resident of Dindoli, was also fined Rs 3,000 in cash by the court, which ordered the convict to pay compensation of Rs 25,000 to the rape survivorsâ€™ families. 
 
 Lohar was arrested on January 20, 2016, from Dindoli by the police for raping the minor girls on a complaint by the father of one of the rape survivors. Both the girls lived in neighbouring houses to that of the convict.
 
 The convict used to take the girls to his house when he found them playing outside their residences. He used to lure them with chocolates and molest the girls while showing obscene videos to them on his mobile phone.
 
 Medical examination found that the girls had been molested. Mobile phone of the convict proved to be a strong evidence against him during trial because obscene video clips had been recovered from it by the Forensic Science Laboratory experts.
