MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed former Union minister M K Alagiri’s petition against the   notice asking him to pay the enhanced shop rents. 

 However, it granted four weeks to him to raise objections, if any, to the notice. 
 
 The Madurai Corporation has leased out its shops situated in many places to several people including  . 
 
 Recently, the corporation enhanced the rent for the shops, regarding which it issued notice to the licencees who had taken them, asking to pay the enhanced rent.
 
 Challenging it, the former minister filed a case. When the case came up for hearing before justice V Bharathidasan, the petitioner’s counsel said the petitioner has taken three shops from corporation, which are situated in   in the city, for which he is paying Rs 10,565 for each shop. 
 
 The corporation sent a notice to him saying that it enhanced the rent to Rs 13,358 and if he failed to pay it, the civic body would bring auction and allot the shops to a successful bidder.
 
 Besides, rent has to be fixed based on the market value, value of building and land. The corporation failed to consider the depreciation of the buildings. 
 
 Further, no adequate opportunity was given to the petitioner to file his objections. Hence, the corporation’s notice deserved to be set aside and it was necessary to restrain the corporation from taking further steps.
 
 The corporation justified the enhancement of rent.
 
 After hearing concerned sides, the bench dismissed his petition.
