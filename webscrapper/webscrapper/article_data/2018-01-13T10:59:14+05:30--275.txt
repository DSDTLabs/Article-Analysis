LUCKNOW:The   ( ) on Friday rapped the six solar power companies that had proposed to set up power plants in the state, saying it could not allow them to sell solar power at a rate much higher than prevailing market prices.

 The companies, including Adani  , had approached the   nearly six months after   (UPPCL) issued them a notice seeking cancellation of their agreement with   over high cost of power and delay in setting up projects despite an agreement in 2015.
 
 The Commission noted that the cost of power proposed to be supplied by the companies—Rs 7.02 per unit-—was much higher than the prevailing market prices of Rs 2.44 to Rs 4 per unit.
 
 “The Commission needs to rationalize the prices. It cannot allow them to get away with such high prices,” UPERC chairman SK Agarwal told TOI after the hearing that lasted over two hours.
 
 While in rest of the country, the agreement was signed for a period of 25 years, UP Neda devised a policy allowing the companies to sign the agreement, finalised during the   regime, for 12 years.
 
 “The short-term agreement led to rise in the prices of solar power,” Agarwal said. He said though the Commission cannot change the tenure of the agreement, it can check the cost of solar power and bring it on a par with prevailing market rates.
 
 The six plants, with a combined capacity of 80MW, belong to   Green Energy, Sahastradhara Energy, Pinnacle Air, Awadh Rubber Prop Madras Elastomers, Technical Associates and Sudhakara Infratech. According to the agreements signed in 2015, the developers had to complete the projects by January 2017. That did not happen, forcing the state government to extend the deadline till March 2017.
