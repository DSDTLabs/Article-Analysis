Panaji: Union minister for Ayush (independent charge) Shripad Naik on Friday challenged the state Congress to move a no-confidence motion against the Manohar Parrikar-led government “if it has the guts”. Naik was reacting to the Congress seeking dismissal of the BJP-led coalition government on the grounds that it is still the single largest party in the state assembly. 

 “If it has the majority, it could have moved a no-confidence motion any time. Who has stopped the Congress from doing so? Not for once the party did this since more than a year. So why all this drama now? What can a single largest party do without a majority?” he said.
 
 “Leave aside a majority, had they staked claim to form the government, the governor would have called them. The party had no wish to form the government, so what could the governor do?” he said when asked whether the Congress would have been permitted to form the government if it had staked claim first.
 
 “The BJP had the majority, with the support of MGP, Goa Forward and three independents. Where would Congress get the majority from? In Goa, they didn’t even stake claim, so how would the governor have called them? Had they staked claim, the governor would have certainly allowed them to form the government. That’s the rule This is the difference between the situation in Goa and Karnataka,” he told reporters. 
 
 In Karnataka, the governor didn’t invite them (Congress-JD-S) as they didn’t have a pre-poll alliance. “If there was a pre-poll alliance, the governor would have called both of them to form the government,” Naik said. In Goa, BJP did not have any pre-poll alliance either, despite which it managed to form a coalition government in 2017. 
 
 “If you look at Congress’ history, in 2004, governor S C Jamir didn’t give the BJP a chance to prove its majority in the Goa assembly though it had the majority,”Naik said.
