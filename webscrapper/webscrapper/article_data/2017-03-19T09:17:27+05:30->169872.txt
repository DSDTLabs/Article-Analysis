HYDERABAD: The Regional Passport Office, Hyderabad, has decided to issue 'single token' to members of a family seeking appointment for issue of passports. Regional passport officer E   on Saturday announced the decision at a passport mela held exclusively for   (SCR) staff and their families at Begumpet Passport   (PSK). 

 Vishnu Vardhan said, "We have noticed that members of a family are facing a peculiar problem due to getting appointments the same day but at different timings. As a result, parents cannot attend for minors during the process of verification of applications. Now, in the new system, the members of family should contact the head of the Passport Seva Kendra and get a single token. 
 
 "Ppassport applications are being processed at different time slots as per online appointment schedules. This is leading to long waiting hours for family members. From now onwards, members of the same family, who have otherwise obtained different appointment slots on a particular day can avail the 'walk-in' family tokens at all 'PSKs' under jurisdiction of Regional Passport Office, Hyderabad, for submission and processing of their passport applications," added the passport official. 
 
 The RPO also said that due to simplification of the rules and regulations, applicants will get passports as they get cinema tickets on the spot. "With the police department's partnership, we are issuing passports in a week under 'normal' scheme. "By the end of this month, we will launch passport services through head post offices in Warangal and Mahbubnagar," he said.
