NEW DELHI:   Speaker   suspended on Monday six   members for 5 days for their “highly unbecoming” conduct in the House as they tore up papers and threw them while protesting against a spate of lynchings by cow vigilante groups.

 The Congress members and others from the opposition benches erupted into protests soon after the Speaker disallowed their adjournment notice over lynchings. They stormed into the Well and tore papers while shouting anti-government slogans, prompting Mahajan to suspend six of them.
 
 Those suspended were Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh, Adhir Rajan Chowdhury, Ranjeet Ranjan, Sushmita Dev and MK Raghavan, all from Congress. “The conduct of the members is highly unbecoming and in abuse of the rules of the House. ...These members were persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the House and have caused grave disorder,” the Speaker said, defending her decision.
 
 “Gaurav Gogoi snatched papers from the table and waived them towards the Chair. K Suresh snatched papers from the table, tore them up and threw them towards the Chair. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Ranjeet Ranjan, Sushmita Dev and M K Raghavan tore papers and threw them towards the Chair,” the Speaker said in her order.
 
 Congress chief   was in the House when her party members trooped into the Well. Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar had agreed to a discussion on the issue, but despite that many members stormed into the Well, Mahajan said. Kumar said, “We not only condemn the incident but say that it was a black day in the history of democracy.”
