Kolkata: The first case lodged in Kolkata under the new law which bans transaction with old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes ran into trouble with RBI not acceding to a plea from cops to accept a deposit of Rs 64 lakh in old currency. The deadlock on Thursday prompted a Sealdah court to direct the RBI to accept the deposit. RBI had set a March 31 deadline to accept old notes.

 According to sources, two sub-inspectors —   and LT   — of Chitpur   had seized Rs 64 lakh from the advocate’s car on March 3. There were 5,012 notes of Rs 1,000 denomination and 2,776 notes of old Rs 500 denomination. The advocate pleaded to the court that his three bank accounts were earlier sealed by the I-T department and the lock was withdrawn on December 28, 2016. He accessed the bank accounts on January 13.
 
 On March 22, Kolkata Police had requested RBI to deposit the old notes, but it was not acceded. Now, cops are unsure if RBI will accept them as Friday is the last day of accepting such notes. While hearing the first case under Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilites) Act 2017, making possession over 10 old notes an offence, Subadeep Ray, ACJM, Sealdah court, on Thursday asked RBI to accept these notes, so these currency notes are not scrapped.
