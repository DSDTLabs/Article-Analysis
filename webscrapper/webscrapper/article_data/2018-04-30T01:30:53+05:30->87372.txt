Chennai: A 25-year-old   with the   is battling for life after setting himself ablaze over his girlfriend’s parents’ rejection of his marriage proposal in Tirutani, Tiruvallur.

 Seaman M Rakesh, posted at INS Rajali (Arakkonam Naval Air Station), sustained 59% burns and is in critical condition at a military hospital in Chennai, the city police quoted doctors as saying.
 
 Rakesh doused himself with   even as his sisters and a cousin looked on in horror, an investigating officer said.
 
 “The Navy man was love with a 22-year-old woman, the daughter of an   functionary, for the past three years,” the officer said. “She is preparing for the civil service entrance examinations in New Delhi and her father recently had her   to a politician’s son.”
 
 The woman’s parents learned about Rakesh and were against their daughter’s relationship with him.
 
 “The woman informed Rakesh that she was engaged to another man,” the officer said. “So he took his sisters, Keerthi and Gomathi, and a cousin, Lokesh, to the woman’s house so they could meet her parents.”
 
 As soon as Rakesh broached the subject, the woman’s father told them that his daughter was going to marry another man. An argument broke out when the woman’s parents refused to entertain any further discussion and both sides were soon trading punches in a free-for-all, the officer said.
 
 “An upset Rakesh went outside, took out a bottle that he had carried with him in his trousers and doused himself with kerosene,” the officer said. “He struck a match and set himself ablaze.”
 
 In a video that Rakesh posted on social media websites, the sailor blames the woman’s parents for his actions. Another video clip online purportedly shows the woman admitting to a relationship with Rakesh.
 
 The officer discounted the second video, saying the woman had told investigators that she had received threats and had made the admission under duress.
