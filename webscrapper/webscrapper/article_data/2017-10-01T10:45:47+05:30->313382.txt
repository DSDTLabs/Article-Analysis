LUDHIANA: Ranjeet Singh (35), a resident of Sidhwan Bet,  , allegedly ended his life by jumping into a canal, after he was denied a share in his parental property. Police have registered a case of ‘abetment to suicide’ against Ranjeet’s family members.

 In her police complaint, Ranjeet’s wife Amandeep Kaur said her husband was having a property dispute with his family members, and he was upset because he was denied a share in the family property, adding that Ranjeet’s sisters — Kanwaljeet Kaur, Soni, and Rani — were also demanding a share, and her mother-in-law too favoured her daughters. Investigation officer, assistant sub-inspector Bahadur Singh, said Ranjeet was missing from the past three days, and on Saturday, his body was found from Sidhwan Bet branch of Abohar branch canal.
 
 Station house officer (SHO) of Sidhwan Bet police station, inspector Paramjeet Singh, said on Amandeep’s statement, they had registered a case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Ranjeet’s sisters. He added that the matter was being thoroughly investigated before arresting the accused persons. Police officials said Ranjeet’s father was dead, while his mother was alive, and added that the family members were having disputes over property for quite some time now.
 
 Meanwhile, cops said Ranjeet’s body was spotted by an onlooker, who informed the police. They added that as the family was already searching for Ranjeet after he went missing from home three days ago, they identified the body after coming to know that a body was found in the canal on Saturday.
