Trichy: A day after TOI exposed the perils lurking in the gateways of Samayapuram Mariamman temple, Trichy police chief S P Kalyan sought a solution that could permanenantly ensure the safety of devotees visiting the temple.  He also ordered inspector of the Samayapuram police station to prepare a roadmap and address forthwith the issues faced by the pilgrims. The move comes amid complaints that traders in the area have been overcharging visitors for puja articles. “Samayapuram police station has been told to discuss with stakeholders to keep a watch on vendors near the temple complex. Canvassing or exhorting visitors to buy puja articles from shops was found to be a major complaint raised by devotees,” The Trichy police superintended told TOI. It is learnt that traders were encouraging devotees to park their vehicles near their shops and exhort them to do some purchase on their shops. The police chief said most of the problems faced by the devotees went unreported as they were often reluctant to file complaint on them. He has instructed the Samayapuram police to ensure maximum safety ahead of the Poochoriyal festival which is due in two weeks. As the eastern and southern entry points were heavily taken up by traders, the police were told to ensure that devotees visiting the entrance could walk freely through the entrance.  “Permanent solution is the need of the hour. Other stakeholder departments should initiate steps to make sure the everything in the temple is safe,” SP Kalyan added. It may be recalled that TOI on February 6 carried a report titled ‘A Wake-up Call for Samayapuram Temple’, highlighting the safety glitches in entry points of the temple. The entrances appear congested following the heavy number of number of shops in the area.
