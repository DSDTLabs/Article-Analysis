THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Launching a fresh attack on   educational institutions, chief minister   said they were established only with an eye on profit.
He was speaking at the inaugural session of the “Save General Education Campaign“ which kicked-off in the state on Friday.
 
 “It (setting up of self-financing educational institutions) began as a noble initiative to prevent students from relocating to other states due to lack of educational institutions in the state. But their only motive now is to amass money. Now, they are not fulfilling the purpose for which they were started.
 
 The hope that they can make more money out of the   than out of abkari business prompted many to establish self-financing institutes,“ said Vijayan in the inaugural address.
