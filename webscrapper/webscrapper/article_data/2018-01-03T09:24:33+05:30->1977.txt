MANALI: Thanking voters for electing him to the assembly, local MLA and   Govind Thakur on Tuesday said he would organize a “dham” (public feast) for them. However, in a departure from tradition, the thanksgiving feast would not have meat and alcohol on menu, he added.

 “Instead, there will be live music and other colourful programmes on the theme of patriotism and religion. Even though I belong to BJP, the event will have no party flag and governor   will also be present on the occasion. All are welcome to join the feast, and not just   supporters,” he said.
 
 Thakur claimed that his government would not enforce anything on people, but make policies only after public discussion. He said the new government would set examples and bring in new reforms.
 
 The minister said he was committed to promote housing and would build with two rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen for the homeless in his constituency. “I will take care of treatment of poor patients. Children from poor families who are keen on higher education but cannot afford money will be provided financial support. We shall prepare a mechanism to strengthen the   (HRTC) and also ensure that private transporters, who are generating self-employment, are not affected adversely. Drug and liquor mafia will not be spared,” he added.
