AHMEDABAD: A group of parents lodged their protest at Pragati School in   area of the city alleging that their kids were made to stand outside the classrooms for non-payment of school fees. The agitated parents now want to take up the issue before the district education officer (DEO).

 On Friday, some of the primary students were asked to stand outside the classroom as school fees of their third quarter had not been paid. When the children told their parents about the issue, they gathered at the school and agitated against the school. School authorities called in police to avoid any untoward incident.
 
 One of the parents said, “School authorities had been asking for fees for last one week. They even told the students to pay the fees or they will not be allowed to sit in the classroom and also in their exams. We had paid the fees for first and second quarter and that too after the introduction of fee regulatory act and only the fees of third quarter were yet to be paid.” The parents further alleged that the school authority was asking for Rs 850 as file fees from the students.
 
 According to the provisions, no school punish students if their fees are not paid. Parents also said that they would again gather at the school to represent the issue on Monday and if their representations are not heard, then they will submit a memorandum before the DEO seeking actions against the school authorities.
 
  and the school authorities could not be reached for their comments over the issue.
 
 This is the same school where a ceiling-fan fell on a student injuring his hand but he is yet to get any compensation from school authorities.
