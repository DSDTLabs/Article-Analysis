 The rally will start from Tirpude College, Civil Lines at 9am and head for Gandhi statue located at Variety Square, Sitabuildi informed President Rajkumar Tirpude. He said, “We have requested people to sport their traditional attires which symbolize their culture so that we celebrate unity in diversity. Priests from various communities will also participate in the rally to relay the message of brotherhood and peace.”
 
 In a press conference, Tirpude said, “The recent incidents of intolerance among communities suggest that some destructive powers have been involved actively in polluting the atmosphere of mutual love, respect and peace. If these powers are not controlled, they may create a sense of enmity in the society.”
