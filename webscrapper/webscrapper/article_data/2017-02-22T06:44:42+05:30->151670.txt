NEW DELHI: The JNU administration on Tuesday stated that it was “aghast at the misinformation the agitating students have been spreading“ over the May 2016 UGC notification. It asked students to abandon the “unlawful path of confrontation and refrain from unlawful and harmful methods of protests“.

 A press release stated: “The best of dialogues can take place only between student representatives and administration officials.“ The students have demanded that the VC himself hold talks with them to resolve the impasse.
 
 The administration said that they have never opposed dialogues and blamed the JNU Teacher's Association for protesting on February 14 and not “approaching the administration to discuss issues related to admission policy.“
 
 Ayesha Kidwai, JNUTA president however said that the administration has not been listening to them. “We have been mailing him for days now but he hasn't replied “ she said.   president   said, “If administration is serious about talking then they should reconvene   meeting“.
