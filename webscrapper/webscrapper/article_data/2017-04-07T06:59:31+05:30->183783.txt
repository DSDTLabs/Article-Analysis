  : The   government-run Maharshi Patanjali Sanskrit   will launch a diploma course in "Hindu  " or priestly duties for all irrespective of caste or religion, its director said on Thursday. 

 "From July this year, we are launching the one-year 'Diploma in Purohityam' for teaching priesthood. This course would be open for all irrespective of caste, gender or religion. The basic qualification needed is class X," director of Bhopal-based Maharshi Patanjali Sanskrit Sansthan P R Tiwari said.
 
 The move is, however, opposed by a Brahmin outfit who had staged a protest in May last year when the government had proposed to make priests from Scheduled Caste community. Tiwari said that students enrolled for this course would be taught about Hindu 'Karmakand' (rituals) performed at various occasions like marriages, house warming etc.
 
 "We will teach these rituals in a logical way along with perfect pronunciation of matras in accordance with Hindu traditions. The priests would have all the explanation related to these rituals, which is basically a science," Tiwari added. 
 
 He said two other diplomas are also being launched along with the 'Diploma in Purohityam' course.
 
 "We are also coming up with diplomas in   and Jyotish Shastra (astrology) along with Purohityam diploma," he said.
 
 Sansthan is the nodal agency for promoting of yoga and Sanskrit in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 Opposing the move,   General Secretary Chandrashekhar Tiwari said that the state government was working against the interests of Brahmins.
