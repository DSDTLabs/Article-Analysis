PANAJI: A day after former senior   minister  , during his Goa visit, said that appointment of the   (CAC) appointed by chief minister Manohar Parrikar in Goa was an ‘unprecedented’ move,   MP Narendra Sawaikar attacked Goa   president Girish Chodankar for petitioning the governor over the CAC.

 Sawaikar said that the Congress’ “constitutional understanding was weak.”
 
 “It looks like the main opposition party is trying to entertain people. The party president has been elected or appointed, no one knows. Yesterday, he has given a representation to the governor that another chief minister for Goa should be appointed. A political party should express its opinion on political issues maturely. There is a difference between heading an NGO or club and heading a party,” Sawaikar said.
 
 He said that the alliance government is working well. “There is no economic or administrative crisis nor it will happen at any cost. Goa will continue to progress as it is presently. Once the chief minister recovers and joins back, all this will stop,” said Sawaikar.
 
 The BJP spokesperson said that the formation of the CAC is within the ambit of the law. “The CM is undergoing treatment and, therefore, he has made this arrangement for a CAC. Someone had threatened to challenge it in court. But no one has challenged it. Now they are going and petitioning the governor to appoint a CM. Goa government is functioning well. The chief minister is heading the council of minister, he is looking after the affairs of the state. Through CAC, this work is going on well,” Sawaikar said.
 
 Sinha, on Wednesday, described the appointment of the CAC “unprecedented” and said it was important for CM Manohar Parrikar to delegate his powers to one of his cabinet colleagues so the government could function properly.
