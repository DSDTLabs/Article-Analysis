GUWAHATI: Nearly 72 hours after a storm brought down a towering 110 ft high Durga idol made of bamboo, the residents and artisans of Bishnupur managed to put the goddess back on the pedestal on Wednesday. However, she lost her towering height and came down to 70 ft.

 With barely a week to go for the Puja, everyone rolled up their sleeves to help the organisers. Master artist   earned a hundred kudos from locals for achieving the impossible task of putting the goddess back to where she belonged within such a short span of time.
 
 More than 70 workers, both skilled and unskilled, got cracking to finish the job in record time. Nearly 6,000 pieces of indigenous bamboo of different varieties like Bijulee, Mokol, and others were used to put together the idol.
 
 The biggest task of the organisers is to give the goddess her 100 ft elevation before the drums start beating ushering in the festival. “We worked 24X7. The support of the people has been overwhelming. This enthusiasm should be sustained for us to help achieve the 100 ft task,” said Ahmed.
 
 When the goddess was towering at a height of 110 ft, the organisers had spoken to the authorities of the Guinness Book of World Records but nature had quashed their hopes. However, after the idol was re-erected, they started dreaming again and got in touch with the representatives of Guinness.
 
 “We were almost on the verge of being awarded the status. An inspection team was set to arrive. But now the process could get longer,” added Ahmed.
