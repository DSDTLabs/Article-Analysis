PANAJI:Putting to rest all speculations about a leadership change in state, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said here on Tuesday that Manohar   would continue to be the chief minister.

 “Parrikar is the chief minister and after two months, he will be back. Under his leadership, Goa will see further development. Any discussion on this issue is baseless,” he said.
 
 Gadkari said he spoke to Parrikar on Monday and he has to be in the US for another six weeks to complete the treatment. “I have spoken to the doctors and they are hopeful that Parrikar will get relief from the treatment and he will get well and come back to the state,” he said. 
 
 Gadkari also said during the “transit period” of two months, Parrikar-appointed cabinet advisory committee members, “who are mature ministers”, will do whatever is required. He said the Centre would support the state government during this period. There were speculations that in view of Parrikar’s health, the party was thinking of an interim arrangement to head the government. Parrikar did not hand over charge to any of his cabinet colleagues before leaving for medical treatment. Instead, he formed a CAC comprising Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar ,   and Francis D’Souza .
 
 A year ago, the coalition government was formed after MGP and GFP submitted letters to the governor saying that they would support the BJP-led government only if it was headed by Parrikar.
 
 Following his ill health, BJP has come under criticism from the opposition for not appointing even an interim chief minister till Parrikar returns.
