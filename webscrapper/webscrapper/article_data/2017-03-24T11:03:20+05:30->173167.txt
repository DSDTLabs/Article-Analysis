PANAJI: With Sakhali MLA Pramod Sawant installed as speaker of Goa legislative assembly,   is now keen to appease Calangute MLA   by nominating him to the chair of deputy speaker. 

 Lobo, who played a key role in helping the BJP gain support of   to form the government, is miffed about being left without a ministry.
 
 Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker on Thursday announced that BJP had proposed Loboâ€™s name for the post of deputy speaker and the nomination had been seconded by Kuncalienker. The election of the deputy speaker will be held on March 24 before chief minister Manohar Parrikar presents the state budget for 2017-18 in the assembly.
 
 Congress has also thrown its hat in the ring and has nominated Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes for the post of deputy speaker. Though Congress emerged as the single largest party during the recent state assembly elections, it lacks the numbers on the floor of the house.
 
 The   had moved three motions supporting Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco for the post of speaker, but the MLA lost 15-20 to Sawant. Interestingly, Lourenco himself reached late for the elections.
 
 For Congress, opposition leader MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar proposed Fernandes' name, which was then seconded by Taleigao MLA Jennifer Monserrate.
