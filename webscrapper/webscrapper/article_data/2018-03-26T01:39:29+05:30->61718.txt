GURUGRAM: A 19-year-old woman, Sanjeela, originally from Bihar and resident of Sirhaul, killed herself, allegedly after an argument with her husband Roshan on Saturday. Cops said Sanjeela had reconnected with her family recently. The couple argued over the same on Saturday night, after which Roshan went to sleep. He woke up at 5am and couldn’t find Sanjeela. 

 He then went to his brother Kaushal’s room and saw her hanging from the ceiling. Roshan broke the door open and informed the landlord, who approached police. Police said the matter is being probed under Section 173 of the CrPC (standard procedure), since no suicide note was found. No FIR has been registered.
