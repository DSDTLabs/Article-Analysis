ALLAHABAD: In a move to usher in transparency, Archaeological Survey of India ( ) has directed its regional and sub-regional offices to post daily updates of monuments renovated across the country on its official website so that the public could track the organisation's progress. 

 ASI has also launched Aadhaar-linked biometric attendance system at its regional office. 
 
 Earlier, ASI used to update the status of its projects once the entire work on a monument was completed. ASI assistant conservation, Allahabad sub-circle, KC   said, "Now, we upload the status of the projects daily and also list reasons if there is no work done on a day."
 
 However, officials said they were unable to upload the information on a daily basis on ASI's official website due to lack of technical staff. "Most of the staff here is above 50 years of age and have hardly worked with computers. Now they are struggling to update the facts in a given format. Most of the time, the which central server does not accept their entries due to the wrong format," said an officer at a regional office, on condition of anonymity.
 
 The sub-regional office at Allahabad has the task of protecting over 400-year-old monument Khusro Bagh, Britsh-era graveyard in the city  , and Ulta Qila.
