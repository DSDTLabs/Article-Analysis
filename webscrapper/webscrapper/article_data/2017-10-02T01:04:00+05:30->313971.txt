Coimbatore: After heavy showers in catchment areas, the Siruvani dam is nearing its full capacity with just 90cm more to be filled. The water level had been steadily increasing in the dam following heavy rainfall in its catchment areas in the last one week. The PWD officials are hoping that the dam will begin to overflow in a few weeks. 

 “Out of the 100 wards in Coimbatore Corporation, 24 wards used to receive water from the Siruvani water supply scheme. Of them, nearly 20 wards are being supplied with Siruvani water. Five days ago, the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation has started drawing 80MLD from the dam and will draw 101 MLD after Diwali,” said Sundarajan, assistant engineer and in-charge of Siruvani water supply scheme. 
 
 The depth of the dam is nearly 50 feet. In terms of capacity, it is currently 877.60m against the full capacity of 878.50m. “There was heavy rainfall on Friday and if such rainfall continues for another week we are hopeful that it will begin to overflow soon,” said Sundarajan. 
 
 Senior officials of the Coimbatore Corporation said that nearly 2500mm of rainfall was recorded at the dam alone. A rainfall of 160mm was recorded last week.
 
 As per the corporation water managers, currently, the core city wards that consist of 60 wards get water supply once a week and some areas even once in five days. 
 
 “In added areas, the supply is once in eight days and it will soon reduce to once in five days after we draw 101 MLD from Siruvani,” said an official. 
 
 Residents were also happy that they were getting Siruvani water finally. “Earlier, we used to get water only once in 15 days and always had to call up water lorry owners to get the tanks filled every week. Now, we are relieved as there is no hassle and we get water once every five days,” said Garima Bothra, a resident of Ponnairajapuram.
