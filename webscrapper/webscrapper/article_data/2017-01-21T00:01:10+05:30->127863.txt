Thiruvananthapuram: The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau has given clean chit to ADGP   on charges of corruption and irregularities during her tenure as  .

 The agency also gave clean chit to chief secretary   in the petition, in which it was alleged that he deliberately hoarded the file seeking action against Sreelekha. The report was submitted to vigilance court here on Friday after conducting a preliminary inquiry into the allegations. The report that probed seven allegations against Sreelekha cited that there are no evidences to prove that she misused the funds under the Kerala road safety authority. The spending of the funds is decided by a committee, the report said.
 
 The petitioner Paichira Navas had alleged that the road in front of Sreelekhaâ€™s residence was given special priority during maintenance works when she was the transport commissioner. But the vigilance has found that it was only one among the top priority roads that were recommended by the corporation for maintenance. The report also says that Sreelekha had paid for the phone and car that she had used while serving as transport commissioner.
 
 The report is now under the consideration of the court. The court said that if the petitioner has any contentions about the findings, it should be presented before the court on February 1.
 
 Meanwhile, the petitioner alleged that the report was deliberately drafted to protect Sreelekha as the statements of former transport commissioner  , who had probed and submitted a report to the government against Sreelekha and transport secretary K R Jyothilal, were not recorded by the agency.
