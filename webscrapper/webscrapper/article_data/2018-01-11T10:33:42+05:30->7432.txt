COIMBATORE/MADURAI/TRICHY: The bus fare from Mettupalayam new bus stand to Karamadai in Coimbatore fixed by the government is Rs 11. But K Krishnan, a trader had to shell out Rs 40 to reach his home as private bus drivers were on a fleecing spree. He said he had bought a bag of herbs and the conductor sought extra money for it. “But they did not issue me any ticket for it. They just pocketed the money,” he said.

 P Siva, a retired employee who had to wait for the bus for more than two hours, said, “The new drivers and conductors are very rude. The private bus drivers are using this opportunity and are fleecing us.” It is not just the private buses. Cab owners are also charging higher fares taking advantage of the strike.
 
 When RTOs were contacted, the officials said they would take action. “We have not received any official complaint regarding this. But we are conducting checks frequently and will take action,” said an official.
