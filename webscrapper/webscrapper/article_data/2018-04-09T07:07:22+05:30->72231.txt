 Sudarshan H V, a Bengaluru student, too found maths time consuming, while physics and chemistry were fine.
 
 Prof P S Sastry, head,  ,  , a city-based training organization for competitive examinations, said physics was difficult. “Four questions were modified versions of those that appeared in the earlier JEE Advanced exam. Mathematics and physics papers are lengthy, making it difficult to complete them in three hours. The cutoff is expectedtobein the range of 85-95,” he added.
 
 “Mathematics had lengthy problems but there was no originality. Most of the questions were from books which students usually refer to. Two of the problems were tricky,” he said.
 
 Analysing the chemistry paper, subject expert Dr Sonar Maruthi said, “As expected of JEE Main, the question paper had given equal weightage to all branches of chemistry. But the best of the students couldn’t solve the paper completely.”
