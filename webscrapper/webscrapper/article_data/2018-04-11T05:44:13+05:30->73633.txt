AHMEDABAD: Most of the 4,000 health   permits issued in 2016-17 were issued on flimsy health grounds, a senior home department official said. 

 A fresh advisory for issuing new health liquor permits will soon be issued and later, during renewal, permits found to be suspicious will be subjected to further scrutiny. This could result in cancellation, the official said. 
 
 The authorities issuing health liquor permit will be first sensitized regarding the new advisory.
 
 “The district area   board will also computerize the data on liquor permits and analyse the grounds on which the permits were issued,” the official said. The decision to revoke these permits will be taken jointly by the state home department, the state health department and the prohibition department after the new health liquor permits guidelines and advisory are issued, the official said.
 
 Home department officials said renewal of health permits may be declined if found lacking in any respect. Earlier, these had been issued for specific medical conditions for which alternative allopathic medical therapy was widely available. There are about 42,291 health liquor permits in the state and about 4,000, that is 10% of them, were issued in 2016-17.
 
 In the old guidelines, medical conditions such insomnia, bronchitis, asthma, anxiety, anxiety neurosis, loss of appetite, angina pain, chronic bodyache, giddiness, trachoma, hypertension, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, coronary insufficiency and restlessness were included.
 
 “Though the capabilities of qualified medical practitioners cannot be doubted, the health department frequently instructed the issuing authorities to review some of the medical conditions for which alternative allopathic therapy was available,” said a senior home department official .
