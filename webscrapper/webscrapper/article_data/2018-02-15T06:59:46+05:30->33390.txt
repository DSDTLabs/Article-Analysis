LUCKNOW: On  , a couple from Sitapur district turned their love affair into a life-long relationship with the blessings of Lord Shiva, Parvati and about two dozen policemen. 

 The couple, Roli Singh and  , both in their early 20s, stayed in Bahubani village under Pisawan police station of the district. Anurag drove the tractor and tilled the agricultural fields owned by Roli's father. 
 
 He did so for three years when he was asked to leave last month. Apparently, Roli's father had sensed the growing affinity between the two and decided to oust Anurag from his daughter's life.
 
 However, the couple was determined to settle down. They got together on Tuesday evening. Knowing they will not be safe on their own, Roli called up Sitapur police superintendent Sureshrao A Kulkarni around 7.30pm.
 
 The officer directed Pisawan circle officer and SHO to meet the couple and help them out. After a lot of back and forth, police officials managed to convince Roli's family to allow the two to get married.
 
 Pisawan circle officer DySP Radha   said though both of them belong to the same caste, "the girl's family is well off and so was not keen on letting her marry Anurag." 
 
 Policemen also called up a local tent house owner, asking him to make wedding arrangements. 
 
 As a Shiva temple is situated on the police station premises, the wedding was solemnized there itself, with parents of both the groom and the bride in attendance, along with policemen. So the couple not only got married on Valentine's Day, they also took vows before Shiva and Parvati on  .
