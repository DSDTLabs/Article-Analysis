PATNA: Former Bihar assembly Speaker   on Wednesday quit the JD (U), alleging rise in incidents of attack on dalits and minorities under the Nitish Kumar-led   government as well as neglect of devoted workers in the JD (U).

 He also announced he would now work for making   leader   Prasad Yadav the next CM, but didn’t make it clear if he would join his RJD. “I am definitely not going to return to the JD (U),” he said and added he strongly believed Tejashwi would be the next CM.
 
 Maintaining that he had so far not made up his mind on the issue of joining any party, Chaudhary said he would work under the ‘larger umbrella’ of RJD-led Grand Alliance.
 
 Chaudhary is the second prominent dalit leader after former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi to leave NDA and work for the GA. Once considered a Nitish loyalist, the 65-year-old has however been critical of the party leadership ever since Nitish dumped the GA and realigned with the   to form a new government in Bihar in mid-2017.
 
 Political observers opined the ex-Speaker felt alienated in his party after former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee chief and dalit leader   joined the JD (U).
 
 Chaudhary served as the Speaker for two terms from 2005-2015. He played a crucial role in the ouster of Manjhi from the CM’s office in February 2015 by averting a split in the ruling JD (U). This had led to return of Nitish as CM.
 
 “The Nitish government has stopped paying scholarship to SC/ST students and converted it into a loan in the name of student credit card. It also failed to check incidents of attack on SCs/STs and vandalisation of Ambedkar’s statute,” the ex-Speaker said and regretted the silence of JD (U) leadership on the Centre’s denial of reservation in promotions to SCs/STs.
 
 The former Speaker recently attended a function of former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha’s Rashtra Manch in Patna.
