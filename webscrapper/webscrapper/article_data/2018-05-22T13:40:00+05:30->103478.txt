BHAGALPUR: A state-of-the-art mother-child health (MCH) ward is likely to be made functional at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College & Hospital (JLNMCH) in   this year to provide quality healthcare to mothers and newborn babies in the region.

 Sources said the MCH wing would have ‘skilled birth attendants (SBAs)’ to handle common obstetric-neonatal emergencies. They will also ascertain the need for critical care by specialist doctors. 
 
 “The objective is to provide mother and baby-friendly environment during the antenatal care, intra-natal care and postnatal care,” an official said, adding the need for such a ward was felt in view of death of women in absence of proper prenatal, intra-natal or postnatal care. 
 
 “The specialty MCH wing will be one of its kinds. It is likely to become operational soon. As most of the deaths of mothers and babies take place at the time of birth mostly due to preventable causes, the MCH ward will be a major initiative for the management of complications during pregnancy and childbirth,” said JLNMCH superintendent Dr R C Mandal.
 
 The sources said unlike the existing maternity wards at government hospitals, including the primary health centres and referral hospitals, the upcoming MCH wing would have better hygienic and sanitized environment. It will have all modern equipment required for safe deliveries.
 
 Apart from doctors having specialization in providing general and critical care, the paramedics at the upcoming MCH will also be trained in adhering to clinical protocols to ensure prevention of infections and display polite and respectful attitude towards the patient-clients.
