Ludhiana: The hurdles in the removal of structures near Jagraon Bridge do not seem to be coming to an end, as on Tuesday, when MC officials tried to hand over notices to people living in houses near the bridge, they refused to accept them. The people first of all demanded their rehabilitation, and asked officials to tell them where they were going to be shifted. They said they were not encroachers, and were living in the area for a long time.

 Officials of the building branch had gone to the area on Tuesday to serve notices to people for vacating the houses. They were given 10 days time for the same, but they refused to accept the notices. So, the officials had to return without handing over the notices. Assistant town planner (headquarters) SS Bindra said people wanted to know where they would get the houses, and only then would they move from the place. He said they would conduct a meeting with the people to convince them.
 
 Notably, the removal of these structures has been demanded by railways authorities before starting reconstruction of one side of the bridge, because the houses are constructed adjacent to the wall of the bridge, and at the time of construction, the houses can get damaged. Congress MP Ravneet Bittu asked officials to vacate the houses as soon as possible.
