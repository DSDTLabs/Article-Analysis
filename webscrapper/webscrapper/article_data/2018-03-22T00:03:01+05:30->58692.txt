Chennai: Dead calf   brought illegally to the city from neighbouring states is ending up on your plate of biriyani ordered from roadside stalls and restaurants, putting your health at risk.

 But lacunae in the rule book is preventing the city corporation and state food safety department from taking action against traders responsible for the illegal import.
 
 In the past 10 days, three incidents of illegal meat being impounded by Greater Chennai Corporation’s health department were reported. All three cases, which happened in Chintadripet was the handiwork of the same person whom police identified as Sakthivel. “His house is in Chintadripet. But he trades meat in Egmore area,” said Chintadripet police inspector Sahadevan . 
 
 But Sakthivel walked out on bail in each of these occasions after paying a paltry sum as fine. Attempts to hold him back by charging him under Section 278 of IPC did not amount to much. There is no provision under the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, to penalise such offenders, said corporation officials. The food safety department is powerless too. “The procedure is to send the sample to labs, wait for a report and then pursue a case. The time taken for this process enables the offender to walk,” said a food safety officer, requesting anonymity.
 
 According to retired Madras high court judge K Chandru, this is a grey area in the law where neither department is empowered to take action. “Unless pushed by the high court, changes to the legislation may not happen,” he said. “The district collector can charge the person under Section 110 of CrPC and declare the individual a habitual offender. We have to work around the shortcomings in the law in such manner to prevent these traders in the interest of public safety,” the food safety officer said.
