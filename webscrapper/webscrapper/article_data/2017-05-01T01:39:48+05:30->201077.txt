NAVI MUMBAI:   does have its share of health concerns and insomnia or   is one of the problems. 

 Increasing day temperatures affect the body’s temperature too and this is one of the main reasons for many suffering from   disorders, experts say. 
 
 Along with erratic working hours, stress and the intrusion of hi-tech gadgets in sleep patterns, doctors say that in order to sleep well one needs to understand the reasons for facing difficulties while sleeping.

 Even people with a number of worries, or many personal and professional responsibilities will suffer from sleep disorder and this has a negative impact on health, he added.
 
 Since sleep plays an important role in thinking and learning, lack of sleep hurts the cognitive processes. “If one doesn’t get enough sleep, one tends to forget what you have learnt during the day,” Dr Patil said. 
 
 With almost 25% increase in patients under the age of 40, sleep has certainly become a factor of concern among the youngsters. 
 
 Sallow or pale skin, puffy eyes, fine lines and dark circles are all indications of nights of missed sleep, said Dr Anand Mishra, an internal medicine specialist. 
 
 According to several studies, people who sleep for less than six hours a day are more likely to become obese than those who sleep for seven to nine hours. 
 
 “People often complain about feeling tired and it is up to health professionals to distinguish if the reason is fatigue or lack of sleep,” Mishra explained. 
 
 Most doctors in the city say that good quality sleep and adequate amount of sleep are important to have better cognitive performances and to avoid health problems and physiological disorders.
