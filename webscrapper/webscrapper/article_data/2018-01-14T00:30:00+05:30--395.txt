Bengaluru: The education department, which on Saturday issued draft regulations amending the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Classifications and Registrations) Rules, 1997, has said that there will be a no-refund policy for new school registrations even if an application is denied.  Many existing schools believe that this will put an end to shoddy document submissions and fraudulent businessmen opening schools.  Under the new rules, the department has issued fee structures for setting up of new schools or classes and said the enrolment of schools will be through an online process, which could be done using the departmentâ€™s IT portal sts.karnataka.gov.in by November 30 every year. The department has notified the fee as Rs 50,000 for setting up a primary institution (Class 1-7); Rs 1 lakh (Class 8-10) and Rs 1,25,000 (Class 11 and 12). For pre-primary schools, the registration and processing fee together will amount to Rs 15,000 in BBMP areas, Rs 7,500 in urban areas other than BBMP and Rs 2,500 in rural areas. A strict adherence to the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS) has been mandated by the department. Schools must put up details of student enrolment and teaching resources on the portal.
