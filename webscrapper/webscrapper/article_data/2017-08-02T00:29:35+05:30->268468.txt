 Swine   became a pandemic in 2009, killing more than a thousand people across the country. This year it has again made a comeback already claiming nearly 600 lives. 
 
 Maharashtra is the worst affected with 284 deaths, followed by Gujarat (75), Kerala (63) and Rajasthan (59), government data shows. “Of the three swine flu deaths at our hospital, two victims were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. One Navin, 25, was from Delhi. They came to the hospital in very critical condition,” said a doctor at RML hospital.
 
 Swine flu is a contagious respiratory disease caused by type A strains of the virus. The virus enters the body through inhalation of contaminated droplets or is transferred from a contaminated surface to the eyes, nose or mouth of a person. 
 
 “Symptoms of swine flu are similar to common viral illnesses. But the intensity is higher. Patients feel lethargic, have high grade fever and sore throat, among other symptoms. Treatment is mostly symptomatic,” said a doctor.
 
 He added maintaining hygiene is most important. “People should wash hands at regular intervals with disinfectants. If there is prolonged fever, one must see a doctor and not ignore symptoms such as difficulty breathing,” the doctor said.
