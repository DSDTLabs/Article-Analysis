LUCKNOW: UP's cabinet minister Anupama   on Friday said   leaders were reaching out to villagers and holding chaupals despite being bitten by mosquitoes. 

 
 When asked for comments about the ministers going to   homes and dining with them, Jaiswal said, "This is the first government which is going to rural areas, holding chaupals in the open despite being bitten by mosquitoes. It shows the commitment of the state government."
 
 "We experience joy while doing so. I had been asked to go to two villages. I have visited four and am planning to visit three more. If I am asked to visit more, I will be happier. It's so satisfying," the minster told reporters. Jaiswal's statement comes two days after another minister   stirred a controversy by saying Dalits felt liberated when BJP leaders visited their homes. Earlier, another cabinet minister   had reportedly ordered food from outside while dining with a Dalit family.
