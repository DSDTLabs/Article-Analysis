KOCHI: An all-party meeting convened by corporation mayor   on Monday decided to start a new boat service in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen route soon.

 The plan is to entrust the running of the boat to the   ( ). The meeting also decided to stop the jankar services in the route for facilitating the construction of mooring dolphin or the pillar for berthing of the boat.
 
 “If the jankar services are stopped after operating the new boat service, passengers' woes can be minimized,“ those attended the meeting said. Similarly, the Cochin Shipyard has completed the construction of the roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels a few months ago and successfully completed the trial run. The Shipyard handed over the vessels to the corporation by June-end. Still, the corpora tion couldn't complete the construction of the Ro-Ro jetty at Fort Kochi.
 
 The   ( ), which has been awarded the work, stopped the jetty work a couple of months ago.
 
 According to CPT, the remaining work could be re sumed only if the jankar service plying in the   route is stopped. Otherwise, the location of pillars which facilitate the anchoring of the vessel should be shifted.
 
 An all-party meeting to be held next week will decide on how to resume the work. The cost of vessels is around Rs 3.8 crore each.
 
 The vessel have the capacity to carry four trucks with a load of 10 metric tonnes, 12 cars and 50 passengers or three trucks, 18 cars and 50 passengers.
 
 The corporation has already handed over Rs 7 crore for constructing the terminals of the total construction cost of around Rs 8.5 crore, sources said.
 
 The Ro-Ro service is expected to decongest the city to a great extent as many of the heavy vehicles, including trucks, would opt Ro-Ro.
