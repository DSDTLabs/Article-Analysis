HYDERABAD: The city is facing an acute shortage of Rs 2,000 notes and this is the first time after   that ATMs are running dry of big denomination currency. This has precipitated a crisis as traders are already suffering from a short supply of Rs 100 notes. Many have put off business transactions due to the crunch.

 People generally prefer cash transactions in the combination of Rs 2000 or Rs 100 notes or Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes. It also helps in easy exchange of cash. “If I don’t have the required combination of notes, I cannot do business. I need to strike a balance between different notes. There is no point holding cash in single denomination. I need a combination of small and big denomination currency,” said V Karthik Sundar, owner of a pharmacy in Domalguda.
 
 Immediately after demonetization, there was severe shortage of Rs 500 notes. ATMs were stuffed with Rs 2000 notes. As a result, transactions were hit. The situation is similar now. “We now have Rs 500 notes. There is shortage of Rs 2000 and Rs 100 notes,” said a senior manager of a public sector  . “We are under tremendous pressure from customers,” he said.
 
 Officials said the main reason for acute shortage of Rs 2000 notes was recalibration of printing machines of   (RBI) .“Once printing machines are recalibrated for a certain denomination, only those notes are printed for about 10 to 15 days. Only then, they are recalibrated for another denomination,” said an official of the apex bank.
