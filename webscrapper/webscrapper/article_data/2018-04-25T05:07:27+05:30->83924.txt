MUMBAI: The   (DMER) will allow post-graduate medical aspirants to fill in fresh choices for colleges they would like to join now that the private institutes have come on board for the admission process. 

 Three days will now be allotted to students to fill up the new choices. 
 
 The state government on Monday allowed private institutes to charge a higher fee for their management quota students. The month-long stalemate ended with the medical colleges agreeing to the 1:4:5 fee formula under which merit students will pay fees decided by the  , management students will pay four times that fee, and NRI candidates, five times the merit seat fee. 
 
 Private colleges had not participated in the first round of admissions as they demanded a 1:5 fee ratio under which they wanted to charge management quota students on a par with the NRIs. 
 
 "We will allow candidates to fill in fresh choices as the fee ratio has altered and students' preferences and financial capabilities must be taken into consideration," said Dr  , head of the DMER. 
 
 Of the 11 private institutes, as TOI had reported, only a few colleges like Kashibai Navale and ACPM, Dhule, admitted students after making them sign an undertaking that if fees rise candidates would have to pay more. Only other hospitals like Bombay Hospital, Sancheti in Pune, Sanjeevani in   and Swastiyog in Miraj admitted post-graduate candidates. 
 
 "Some students are planning to move court against the state government's intervention to allow college to up their fees," said a parent. 
 
 Some who will now be forced to pay higher fee in ACPM College and Kashibai Navale may also re-apply in the fresh choice filling round. So far, of the 400 seats, 192 seats remain unfilled in private institutes.
