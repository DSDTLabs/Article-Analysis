 In their press statement, Y NOT studios have said that the film involves extensive Computer Graphics work to show the lead actors in good light. They have also said the  's biceps and shoulder have been outsourced to a company in Los Angeles, California and the heroine's wrinkle removal and under eye work another sudio in Amsterdam. 
 
 
  
 
 it is to be noted that a similar press statement was given by the makers of Rajinikanth's '2.0'. Looks like director CS Amudhan and the makers of the film are taking a dig at the superstar film. Also, producer   made fun of the two month long shutdown by the Kollywood industry by saying, "The main reason is definitely not because of the 2-month long summer holiday, when industry was shut-down for repair work?"
 
 
  
 Produced by Y NOT Studios, the film stars Shiva, Disha Pandey, Ishwarya Menon and Sathish in the lead. '  2.0' has music by   and is slated to release this year. 
 
 In December last year, the first look poster of 'Tamizh Padam 2.0' went viral on the internet. The poster had actor Shiva taking a dig at Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam for his 'Dharma Yudham'. The hilarious poster also took a jibe at piracy website 'Tamilrockers'.
