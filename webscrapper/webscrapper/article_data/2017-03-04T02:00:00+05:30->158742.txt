PATNA:   will happen near the   again this Sunday.

 Last Sunday, The   showed how streets can be freed of fumes and turned into spaces of pure fun as thousands gathered on the road around the Gandhi Maidan on its southern side to be part of the city’s first-ever Happy Streets. The young and the old alike did yoga, meditation, cycling, hula hooping, dancexercise, Zumba... and all that helps you live a healthy, happy life.
 
 Visibly not content with the three-hour session, many asked if it will continue on next Sunday. Here we reply: yes. TOI will conduct Happy Streets again near Gandhi Maidan on March 5 and on the S K Puri Children’s Park road on March 19 and 26.
 
 Yoga, meditation, badminton, human snakes and ladders, puzzle solving and clay modelling, skating, cricket, football and Zumba will feature on the Happy Streets on March 5 too.
 
 The venue — JP roundabout to   — will also have a Buddy Zone for kids’ activities and a Physiotherapy Zone for fitness freaks to dancexercise. If you so wish, you can also measure your might by being part of a tug of war at  .
 
 Those who love cycling but have not pedalled for long for fear of vehicular traffic, can freely try it out on Happy Streets, which will be declared out of bounds to vehicles of all kinds from 6.30am to 9.30am. Just show your copy of the TOI, and we will provide you a rent-free bicycle for the purpose.
 
 There’s something for music buffs too: live performances by three bands which claim their audiences just can’t resist the temptation to groove to their rocking music.
 
 See you at JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan at 6.30 on Sunday!
