Telling us more about this, Anish says, “Just like in   (Kanna Sanneyindalene), the romantic number in Vaasu... is also shot in Norway. And just like in Akira, it had to be Puneeth crooning the song in this film.” Sharing pictures from the recording session that was held in Bengaluru, Anish tells us that Puneeth recorded for his portion of the song on Tuesday.
