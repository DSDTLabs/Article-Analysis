KOCHI: The strike called by All   on Sunday didn't have much impact in Kochi as many of the petrol bunks remained open. 

 All Kerala Federation of Petroleum Traders declared that they will comply with   (CIPD) call for a 24-hour closure of petrol pumps across the country on May 14. They were protesting "meagre" commissions offered by the public sector oil companies and demanding a hike in dealers' commission.
 
 The strike, which began from Saturday midnight, was to continue till Sunday midnight. However, by Sunday morning several petrol pumps were working in the city. R Sabrinath, vice-president,   (FAIPT) said that their members were not part of the strike and all of them had opened their petrol bunks on Sunday. 
 
 "About 150 petrol pumps belonging to our members at Ernakulam were working on Sunday and some of the bunks had to be closed early as they ran out of stock due to heavy demand," said FAIPT secretary Basheer. Meanwhile, the open petrol bunks had a good rush of customers throughout the day. Hari Prasad from Falcon Fuels said, "The sales were better than usual. Compared with normal days, we sold about 2,000 litres more petrol."
 
 However, Augustine Kunnathuparambil, manager,   said that they saw panic sales on Saturday night but on Sunday the business was as usual. The strike was called as the oil companies had failed to reach a consensus in the agreed commission. Though there was recommendation to increase the commission last November, the oil companies failed to bring that into effect, pump dealers allege.
