GURUGRAM: Three robbers, wanted in at least 8-10 cases, were arrested by the Sector 17 crime unit while they were committing another robbery. 

 The group of domestic robbers had resurfaced recently, and were apprehended during a police raid. Inspector Narender  , who led the police team, said the trio was planning another robbery and had collected rods and other equipment when they were caught from the service lane near the crossing of sectors 17 and 18. 
 
 Identified as Rajesh alias Raju (27) of Dausa, Sonu alias Ravi (22) of   (22) and Jeevraj (19) of Ajmer, all from  , they were arrested by police last Wednesday and interrogated in police remand for five days afterwards. They were produced before the magistrate again and sent to judicial custody on Monday, police said. Police had declared them proclaimed offenders in the past.
 
 Talking about their modus operandi, cops said they live in slums and keep moving around the city. “Since they are so mobile, it was difficult to track them,” Chauhan said. 
 
 The group functioned like an organised gang. “If they figured out someone was sleeping in a house, they would still try to rob it, and attack anyone who tried to resist them,” he added. 
 
 Police said they had recently robbed three houses, from which they mostly stole cash and jewellery. They added that they have recovered   and silver jewellery, and other valuables from the gang, after they started probing a recent case of domestic robbery.
