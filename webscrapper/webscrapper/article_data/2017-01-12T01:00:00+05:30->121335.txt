Sony SAB’s TV show 'Ichhapyaari Naagin' witnessed a lot of drama after the entry of Naagin Vishaili. The Naagin transforms into Amrita (Rehyna Malhotra), a human form who is on a mission to destroy   family. She also successfully tricks   (Mishkat Verma) into drinking the poisonous milk after which Babble starts behaving negatively. She now aims to convert Babble into one of her own, an Ichhadhari Naag.

 All the attempts by Ichha ( ) to save Babble fritter away after his engagement with Amrita. Ichha notices the change in Babble’s behavior and realises that Amrita is planning something vicious.   (Praveen Sirohi) who is suspicious about Amrita asks Babble to break the engagement so that Amrita can marry Sabbal (Rakshit Pant). Infuriated by Prabbal’s request and unaware of his poisonous powers, Babble bites Sabbal in a fight in the akhada. Pratap rushes Sabbal to a doctor as he falls unconscious due to the poison in his body. Later, police arrests Babble for attacking his own brother. Taking advantage of the situation Amrita kidnaps Babble and takes him for the process of Naag atmikaran. However, Ichha gets to know about Babble’s kidnapping and she decides to inform the Prataap family. 
 
 Mishkat said, “After drinking the poisonous milk Babble starts converting into a naag and he bites Sabbal out of anger. This creates chaos in the family. Babble himself is clueless about his behavior and feels guilty. However Amrita has a different plan for him. The climax of the track is very interesting.”
