NAGPUR: Absence of a proper sewerage and waste disposal system in Alappuzha in Kerala has not just become a threat for its waterways but also to the   lake which is known as the largest ecosystem in  . The problem will now be tackled scientifically by Nagpur-based CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri).

 As per a recent memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) and Neeri, the latter will provide technical support in treating sewage.
 
 According to Neeri scientists, prominent canals of the region — Vada and Commercial — are completely covered with water hyacinth. 
 
 “Waste that people are discharging from their washing areas, kitchens and septic tanks is going into the canals where most of the drains meet. This is the reason behind growth of hyacinth which is leading to eutrophication of canals which kills the aquatic system,” said  , the principal scientist at Neeri’s centre or strategic urban management and director’s technical cell, who recently visited Alappuzha for spot inspection.
 
 The two canals go on to meet Vembanad lake, a popular backwater tourist destination. “The pollution is a major threat for the lake too. Besides, these canals would be used for navigation purposes,” said Vijay.
 
 Various studies done in the past reveal that sewage and plastic waste, dumped into the waterways, is polluting the water quality of the region. 
 
 Neeri will be using its patented technology of phytorid wastewater treatment to revive the canals. The technology uses specific plants to absorb nutrients directly from waste water. “We plan to install phytorids at the land adjacent to canals. The drain water will be first treated and then can be reused for gardening or floriculture. Our aim will be to ensure that only treated water enters the canals to increase the dilution,” said Vijay.
 
 According to him, removing hyacinth is not a permanent solution as they will keep growing. “The canals can only be cleaned if sewage is treated at the source,” he added. Neeri will first carry out a pilot experiment at one location. 
 
 The phytorid technology involves a constructed wetland exclusively designed for treatment of municipal, urban, agricultural and industrial wastewater. The organic solution is removed by bacteria and the nutrients are absorbed by specific plants. 
 
 “The plant uses porous media such as crushed bricks, gravel and stones for filtration. To avoid choking, we do not use soil. The quality of treated water is excellent, it meets the prescribed and amended norms of the   (CPCB),” said Vijay.
 
 THE PLAN 
 
 - Neeri to provide technical support to KILA for treating sewage
 
 - Two canals are highly polluted due to discharge of sewage 
 
 - Neeri will use phytorid technology to treat sewage
 
 - Technology involves a constructed wetland exclusively designed for treatment of waste water
 
 - It requires minimum electricity and mechanical requirement
