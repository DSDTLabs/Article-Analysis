NAGPUR: Literature based on Ambedkarite ideology and that which is inspired by Gautam Buddha’s and Jyotiba Phule’s teaching is the actual Ambedkarite literature for me, said Gel Aamvet, Ambedkarite thinker, at Ajantha Hall, near Baidyanath Square, on Friday.

 Aamvet was speaking during the inaugural programme of 13th Akhil   organized by   along with Sanskriti Samvardhan Mandal.
 
  She said, “Ambedkarite literature is inspired by the feelings we go through while dealing with the troubles in our life.” 
 
 “Ambedkarite literature isn’t only about expressing sorrows, but they also show the way to achieve peace. It inspires us by portraying the beauty of life. Ambedkarite literature is the only way to overcome ills of class-based society,” Aamvet said.
 
 Aruna Lokhande, Asha Thorat, Rekha Meshram and Sunanda Ramteke also spoke on the topic ‘Ambedkari Sahityatil Mazi Bhumika Ani Vastavya’. 
 
 Similarly, the topic ‘Badalte Samajik Vastavya Ani Ambedkari Sahitya’ was discussed by Tarachand Khandekar, Bhimsingh Dethe, Bhaskar Patil and Shantarshit Gawande. 
 
 Dutta Bhagat presided over the programme while Bharat Pathankar and Avinash Dolash were the chief guests of the programme. Shalik Jilhekar compèred the programme while Prabhu Phulzale proposed a vote of thanks.
