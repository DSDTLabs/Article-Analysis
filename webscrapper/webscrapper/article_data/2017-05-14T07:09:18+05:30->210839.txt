CHENNAI: Launching a   on the   government, AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) MP V Maitreyan on Saturday said the regime would fall on its own in the backdrop of corruption charges faced by the ministers, and that there would be   soon.

 Maitreyan was recalling the I-T raid on the premises of the health minister C Vijayabaskar and the department’s complaint to the police against three ministers for disrupting their work, besides the FIR filed against food minister R Kamaraj after a rap from the Supreme Court in a cheating case, as well as bribery charges against social welfare minister V Saroja. 
 
 “There used to be military discipline during Amma’s regime. Now, the chief minister has no control over his ministers and all of them act on their own,” the MP told TOI. He said the law and order situation in the state was deteriorating with mysterious deaths taking place. On the industries front too, many units were leaving the state one after another, he added.
 
 In the event of elections, Maitreyan said his faction would register a massive win and   would become chief minister. “The Election Commission will decide on my petition on the appointment of V K Sasikala as general secretary. Two leaves symbol will certainly come to us,” he said, asserting that the cadres and people remained with the OPS faction.
 
 Later, Maitreyan said on Twitter, “Edappadi benami government is on transfer spree. Earlier IAS officers were transferred, now it is IPS officers’ turn. Only corrupt ministers of TN government remain stay put in their offices.”
