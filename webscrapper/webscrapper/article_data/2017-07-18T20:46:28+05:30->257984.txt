MUMBAI: An online switcher with a television news channel committed suicide by   at   station late on Sunday. Prima facie, the motive was unrequited love. 

 Nitin Shirke, the deceased, left a suicide note on his Facebook page around 9.50 pm, holding a couple responsible for his death. Many of his friends tried to reach him on his phone thereafter but got no response. His superior from work also left a message on his Facebook timeline, but in vain.
 
  
  
 
 "As of now, we have recorded a case of accidental death. We will be making inquiries with Shirke's family as well as the couple mentioned in the note before arriving at any conclusion," said an officer from Mumbai Central GRP.
