NEW DELHI: Going by his   profile,   believed in not flinching in situations of danger. How he implemented that philosophy in his life was a different matter altogether. 

 About 100 days before his foolhardy act took his life, the 16-year-old had uploaded a photo-status on Facebook. The post dated October 31, 2016, was quite bold, peppered with a few unprintable words. And if it were all right to assume about someone through his/her Facebook profile introduction, Kumar believed in “no compromises”. 
 
 A student of an east Delhi public school, Kumar was fond of being in front of and behind cameras. A selfie junkie, like most other teenagers of his age, Kumar’s shots were, however, different. 
 
 Even risque. And yet, he didn’t care about the world making an opinion about him. In fact, self-confidence, it seems, was never a problem for him. His last photo update was on November 26, which read, “If someone wants to bring you down, it only means that you are above them.”
 
 His family knew his love for the lens, but they never thought he would risk his life for a shot. “He never asked for a camera, but wanted a new phone as its camera wasn’t as good as the ones his friends had,” said Kamlesh, his mother. 
 
 “He would often make plans with his friends, but never compromised on his studies,” said Ravi, Kumar’s uncle. “Even though the Saturday plan was made long ago, he didn’t tell us that he would be going out with friends after coaching classes. When he didn’t return until 3pm, we called up his tutor who told us about his going out with friends,” Ravi added.
 
 Kumar had great faith in his friends. He had posted a group photo on July 31 taken at an amusement park. The message with the photo read: “Never let you down, best friends forever.”
 
 But life just let him down. Or did he let down life? There are no easy answers.
