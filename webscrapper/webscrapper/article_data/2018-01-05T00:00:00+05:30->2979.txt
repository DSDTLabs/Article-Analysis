Probably, no actress in Mollywood has ever done the character that   will be playing in her next in Malayalam. 

 In director Sugeeth’s upcoming   starrer Shikkari Shambhu, the Su…Su…Sudhi Vathmeekam actress is playing a butcher named Anitha.
 “I have so far been a girl-next-door onscreen and have never tried something of this sort before,” says an excited Sshivada. Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.
 
 All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.
 
 Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.
