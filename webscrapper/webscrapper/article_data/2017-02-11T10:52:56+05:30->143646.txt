BENGALURU: Karnataka has played a small but substantial role in the political drama playing out in Tamil Nadu. When V K Sasikala was set to take over as the southern state’s chief minister last week, a step taken by the Karnataka government — it moved the   seeking pronouncement of the verdict in former TN CM J Jayalalithaa’s disproportionate assets case — delayed Chinnamma’s swearing-in.

 TN chief minister   resigned on Sunday to make way for Sasikala. However, on Tuesday, he revolted against the AIADMK general secretary, saying he had stepped down in duress and was willing to take back his resignation.
 
 Meanwhile, an important development took place in Karnataka. Senior counsel Dushyanth Dave on behalf of the Karnataka government moved the Supreme Court on Monday, reminding it of the reserved verdict in Jayalalithaa’s assets case, in which Sasikala is also an accused. The apex court said it would pronounce the judgment in a week.
 
 “TN governor C Vidyasagar Rao was expected to administer oath of office to Sasikala any time after the resignation of Panneerselvam was accepted. Then came the Supreme Court’s dictum saying it would pronounce the judgment soon. Probably, the governor wants to be extra cautious, and hence he’s waiting till the verdict is out,” said Navaneetha Krishnan, Rajya Sabha member of AIADMK and senior lawyer, who had appeared for Jayalalithaa and other accused in the DA case.
 
 AIADMK leaders said they were expecting the verdict on Monday and the governor is unlikely to take a decision on Sasikala’s claim to form the government till then.
