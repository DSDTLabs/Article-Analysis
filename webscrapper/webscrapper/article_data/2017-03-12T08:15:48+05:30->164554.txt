CHENNAI: Railway minister   has made a call to the state government to help revive the 179km   via Mamallapuram. At a function in Trichy on Saturday, the minister inaugurated a slew of infrastructure works and said that the line could be re-examined with the help of the state government as it will help increase tourism in the Union territory. The cost of the project which was mooted nine years ago has touched Rs 1,200crore as per the 2017-18 budget estimates. 

 The work to build the line failed to take off because of sluggish release of funds. Preliminary surveys are being done with the money which is being allocated every year. The line is supposed to be laid between Old Mahabalipuram Road and ECR and was the first stretch of a coastal railway line proposed all the way down to Kanyakumari. 
 
 Suresh Prabhu’s appeal comes close on the heels of the state government’s recent demand to the Union ministry to speed up a coastal road from   to Kanyakumari. 
 
 If the road comes up,   will lose passengers because it is already not in a position to introduce more   to the southern districts because of congestion of lines. 
 
 In the next five years, railways will double the electrification projects, said Prabhu.
 
 The minister said that railway was focusing on infrastructure development like doubling, trebling, and electrification, to meet future demands of traffic.
 
 Various representations on railway development that have been received -- covering Karaikkudi, Mayiladuthurai and Ramanathapuram area -- will be examined, he said. “These projects were shelved earlier, because they were considered unviable. I am trying to find out ways on working on these projects to operationalize them in the course of next few years”, he said.
