NEW DELHI: Observing that “it’s a sin to kill people who are in love”, deputy chief minister   on Monday wrote in a note that “murders in the name of honour killings are disturbing very much”. 

 In the note, he asked the art and culture department to draw a plan to hold cultural and musical events and organise thought-provoking street plays on these victims to help people develop an understanding of the deeper meaning of love. 
 
 “Sahitya Kala Parishad and other academies should come up with thought-provoking programmes like evenings of songs and ghazals of love paying tribute to all youngsters killed like this,” Sisodia said. He also proposed a kavi sammelan in which legends like poet-lyricist Gulzar might be invited. 
 
 Sisodia has asked the secretary in charge of art and culture to discuss the matter with the heads of various academies and come up with a plan at the earliest.
