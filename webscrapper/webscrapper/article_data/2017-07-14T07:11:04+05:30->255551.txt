CHENNAI: Early this week, NITI Aayog CEO   said TN, Kerala and Assam fared worst on ease of doing business. The downhill drive of business sentiment in   has started to impact jobs. On Thursday, an employment portal said job creation through online channels in Chennai during June was down 12% year-on-year - the steepest decline among all monitored cities. All India average growth was 11%. 

 City-wise data showed that among metros, Kolkata (up 40%) continued to lead the long-term growth in June 2017. Mumbai (up 15%), Hyderabad at 5%, Bengaluru was up by 3%, while annual growth trend in Chennai (down 12%) exhibited the steepest decline. Online hiring activity in Delhi-NCR matched the year-ago level while Baroda was up 36% followed by Ahmedabad which was up 20%, said data from Monster.com.
 
 Industry officials reckon that a drop in industrial activity coupled with tepid tech sector hiring was dragging down everything along with it. E Balaji, president people services, TVS Logistics said, "TN is a big recruiter for IT talent. The slow growth in the sector could be one of the reasons." 
 
 The past year has political unrest resulting in economic slowdown, impacting investor sentiments. "The leadership crisis has dampened investor spirit. We have not been able to draw the kind of investments that   has," said P Ravichandran, president   and Chairman, CII-Tamil Nadu.
 
 Experts attribute the slowdown in demand to the decline in sectors that are core to Chennai construction, real estate, energy, and manufacturing. "This is bound to contribute to a decline in demand," said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, Ciel
