 Buyout private equity firms such as Blackstone Group, Apax Partners and Partners Group, or their portfolio companies like Mphasis and Zenzar Technologies, among others, could be interested in the deal. The sale process could also attract the attention of BPO majors like WNS.
 
 An emailed questionnaire to IGT remained unanswered at the time of going to press.  , the parent of India’s largest airline IndiGo, has interests in aviation, hospitality, travel commerce, airline management, pilot training and real estate.
 
 InterGlobe, through Indi-Go, is said to be in contention to buy into the soon to be privatised Air India.

 The company’s revenues are almost equally split between technology services and BPO operations. IGT offers multi-channel customer services across voice and non-voice in over 20 international languages.
