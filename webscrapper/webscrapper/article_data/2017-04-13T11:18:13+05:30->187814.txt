PUNE: Consumer technology company Intex will invest Rs 200 crore in the next few months to expand its   manufacturing capabilities,   business head (retail) Vishal Malik, said.

 With temperatures soaring across the country, the company sees major demand for airconditioners in tier-II and III towns.
 
 The company launched its airconditioners in March and is looking to address the demand in smaller towns of the country.
 
 “A customer looks for good pricing, good product and good service. We are focusing on all three. We understand the basic needs instead of going for expensive features. What is more important for customers in smaller towns is faster cooling and less power consumption, rather than features they may not use,” Malik said. 
 
 By July 2017, the company will be consolidating its three manufacturing plants in Noida into one at  , spread over 20 acres. The combined plant will manufacture cellphones and consumer durables, including washing machines, refrigerators and airconditioners.
 
 Intex had earmarked Rs 1,500 crore for the expansion, of which it has already spent Rs 650 crore. The balance will be spent as the demand arises.
 
 Malik said the company is focussing on moving from a ‘handheld goods’ company to a ‘household goods’ one. In two years, the company aims to re-balance the revenue at 50:50 (from 25:75 currently) from handheld devices and accessories, and consumer durables.
 
 Intex has a marketshare of over 9% in the country’s burgeoning mobile phone market. In late 2016, when the Jio wave hit the market, Intex did not have a 4G mobile offering. As a result, the company’s overall revenue for financial year 2016-17 is likely to remain flat at about Rs 6,200 crore, despite the fact that consumer durables and IT revenue for the company grew over 60% to Rs 2,000 crore.
