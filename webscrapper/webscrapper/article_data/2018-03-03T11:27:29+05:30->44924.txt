PANAJI: The directorate of health services (DHS) has appointed a candidate with disabilities as a servant/attendant following an order from the state commissioner for persons with disabilities.

 The directorate in 2015 had erroneously advertised double the number of vacancies in each of the reserved categories of hearing impaired, visually impaired and loco-motor disability, despite receiving NOCs from the personnel department to fill up two posts reserved for the hearing impaired and one each in the visually impaired and loco-motor disability categories. 
 
 One person who applied in the loco-motor disability category, was called for the interview and chosen by the selection committee. He was issued an offer of appointment in September 2016, but a month later, the directorate cancelled/withdrew his offer of appointment without citing any reason.
 
 Commissioner for persons with disabilities,   in an order last year, directed DHS to give   (name changed) an “appointment letter immediately with retrospective effect, bringing him at par with the other three people who were given offer of appointment followed by an appointment order, by absorbing him in the general category till you create a supernumerary post for him”.
 
 She stated that the directorate only added salt to injury by cancelling/withdrawing his offer of appointment without citing any reasons for doing so. Sushant pursued the matter with the commission that in turn pursued it with the directorate, and he has finally been appointed to the sub district hospital,  . 
 
 He will be on probation for two years from the date of joining. He will be redesignated as multi-tasking staff and placed in the pay scale as per the Matrix 7th Pay after training, the order states.
