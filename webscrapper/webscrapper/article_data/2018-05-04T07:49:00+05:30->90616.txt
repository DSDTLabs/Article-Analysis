Ludhiana: Raising alarm bells, doctors at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) claimed asthma cases were rising among children these days, and during the harvesting season, more patients are diagnosed every year. The hospital observed the World Asthma Day at the hospital premises to create awareness regarding myths and facts regarding the disease.

 Dr Puneet Aulakh Pooni, professor and head of Paediatrics department, said the problem of asthma was quite common among children. “The most important cause of asthma was adoption of an unhealthy lifestyle, including intake of cold drinks and junk food, and not participating in physical activities. During the harvesting season, complaints of asthma increase.” In their asthma clinic, they were diagnosing at least 8-10 new children suffering from the disease. However, she did not give any particular reason for the problem, saying there could be multiple reasons, like pollution and allergies. “Besides, the disease cannot be cured, only controlled,” she added.
 
 Dr Akashdeep Singh, associate professor of Respiratory Medicine, said: “Asthma is a clinical disease, and there is no specific test to diagnose it. In society, there are many myths related to asthma, and people should be made aware that a disease like asthma can be easily prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle and avoiding triggers that activate it.” Secretary Prem Kumar Gupta said: “DMCH has been running a special asthma clinic every Thursday in the Paediatrics OPD of the hospital since 2008, where more than 1,800 asthma patients are being followed up.”
 
 Also present on the occasion were principal Dr Sandeep Puri, and dean (Academics) Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, who also shared their views in adopting precautions to treat asthma. A drawing competition was held in the Paediatrics OPD of the hospital, where winners were awarded prizes.
