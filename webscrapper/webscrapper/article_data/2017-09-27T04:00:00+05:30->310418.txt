Surat: Congress leader Hosang Mirza has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding justice for thousands of account holders and 140 employees of the Diamond Jubilee Cooperative Bank by speeding up trial, which is pending for the past 14 years in the default case. 

 Mirza said the Supreme Court recently stressed on the need to set up fast-track courts in cases pending against MPs and MLAs. An MP had defaulted on a loan amount to the tune of Rs50.88 crore, This led to the collapse of the 70-year-old Diamond Jubilee Cooperative Bank. The chargesheet was filed by police in the court of chief judicial magistrate in Surat in 2003. However, the case is yet to come up for hearing, Mirza said, adding that 140 employees of the bank lost their jobs and thousands of account holders their savings when the bank collapsed. 
 
 “I have urged the Prime Minister to direct the state government to speed up the trial in the case,” the Congress leader said.
