NEW DELHI: India’s rules to check tipsy pilots and air-hostesses are all set to get stricter.

 The Directorate General of   ( ) has proposed to introduce preflight breath analyser (BA) test for pilots and cabin   at transit points if they leave the plane to go to the terminal building before operating the next leg of the flight. And, it wants crew to be grounded as soon as they land if they operated a flight by skipping the test.
 
 DGCA has issued draft rules which also address concerns raised by crew following some cases in which teetotaller pilots and air hostesses flunked the test. Such crew claimed the equipment currently used for BA test ‘catches’ the alcohol content of their aftershave, perfume, cough syrup or even homeopathic medicines.
 
 “If the crew member wishes to undergo confirmatory test on alternate equipment, (it)... can be done on alternate equipment, provided the crew submits in writing a request for the same,” the draft rules say.
 
 If a pilot or crew member fails a pre-flight test and then refuses to undergo or skips a post-flight BA test, or vice versa, his or her licence may be suspended for three years. And if the same person then fails a pre-flight and a post flight BA test each, his or her licence could be suspended for four years under the proposed rules.
 
 Currently, a crew member failing or skipping pre-flight BA test for the first and second time means licence suspension for three months and three years, respectively. Failing the third time leads to licence cancellation.
 
 Failing and skipping the post-flight BA once leads to licence suspension for a year and three months, respectively. Failing post-flight BA twice means licence cancellation. The proposed new rules also apply to additional crew travelling in cockpits.
