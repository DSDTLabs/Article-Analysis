CHENNAI: The government announced in the budget on Thursday that it will obtain assistance from the   for conservation of the Pallikaranai marshland.

 A senior forest official said the marshland had the potential for carbon sequestration to slow  .
 
 Once the forest department completes a study on how much carbon can be sequestered in the marsh, it can approach the GCF.
 
 The GCF was established in 2010 to limit or reduce   in developing countries and help vulnerable societies adapt to unavoidable  . Another official said the existing dump yard in the marshland may be shifted elsewhere using GCF.
 
 Spread over about 700 hec tares, Pallikaranai is a water table recharging unit for south Chennai. During the monsoon, it helps excess water from surrounding areas like Velachery and Madipakkam drain into the sea. It supports a variety of birds and fish and species of shrubs.
 
 Over time, large portions have been encroached upon to facilitate setting up of educational institutions, housing complexes and IT firms.
 
 Only in the last few years, with the intervention of the Madras high court, has the marshland been getting some protection.
