HYDERABAD: A proposal mooted by the Hyderabad Metropolitan   and   Board (HMWS&SB) to fix   meters with   (RFID) technology for domestic connections may hit a financial hurdle as the civic body may incur a cost of Rs 375 crore to put in place the new meters. 

 The board is mulling fixing water meters on the lines of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board model, where the utility bought meters and collected the fee from customers later. The officials worked out a feasibility study by taking into account the number of customers who were not having meters and financial viability if RFID water meters were fixed. 
 
 “During the water board’s recent meeting, we had discussed the proposal of fixing the meters and tender process. We have decided to fix RFID meters on ‘build, own, operate and transfer’ (BOOT) method. As per the estimates, water board may require nearly Rs 375 crore. As per the HMWS&SB records, water is being supplied to over 9.02 lakh customers (connection sizes range between 15 mm and 60 mm diameter) in the city. Of 9.02 lakh customers, 8.63 lakh customers (all are domestic) have 15 mm diameter connections,” HMWS&SB chief general manager-revenue S Anand Swaroop told STOI. 
 
 The RFID meters provide accurate data on quantity, pressure and status online. In the current system, a meter reader has to visit a household physically to get the reading, but with the RFID gadget, the reader gets the reading through devices on the spot. The cost of each RFID meter is around Rs 7,500, while the automated meters cost Rs 1,500. “If the water board wants to prefer the new technology RFID meters, we need Rs 375 crore to put them up,” he added. 
 
 “We have to approach the government or take loan. The water board, however, has targeted to fix meters to all customers by 2018,” the official added.
