Mumbai: The city is likely to get twin tunnels on the lines of the Chenani-Nashri  , which would run under   (SGNP) and between   and   lakes for the proposed Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR).

 The BMC has prepared a draft plan for the tunnels after conducting a soil testing exercise along the stretch. Two separate parallel tunnels of three lanes each have been proposed to connect the eastern and western suburbs.
 
 Officials said they have included most of Chenani-Nashri’s features in this tentative plan. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the landmark 9.2km Chenani-Nashri tunnel—among Asia’s longest—that would reduce driving time between Jammu and Srinagar by two hours.
 
 The BMC stated that it would use advanced tunnel boring machines, and not explosives, to break the rocks for tunnelling. Officials said the proposed tunnels will not have an opening to ensure that the ventilation does not disturb animals in the national park; instead, it will have an artificial ventilation system. 
 
 One end of the tunnels will open near Bhandup water treatment plant and the other near Film City in Goregaon. 
 
 The BMC is currently struggling to get permissions from the forest department as well as the environment ministry for the proposed tunnels. “We are preparing a proposal based on geo-technical investigation findings and will send it to the forest department for its permission,” said additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Mukherjee. Officials said after the forest department clearance domes in, the BMC will send the proposal to the Union environment ministry for approval; the process may take around a year.
 
 Environmentalists have expressed their concerns. “It is a good idea and we won’t oppose the plan. Our concern is that the civic authority have a proper disposal plan for the mud that will be excavated during the tunnelling,” said environmentalist D Stalin.
