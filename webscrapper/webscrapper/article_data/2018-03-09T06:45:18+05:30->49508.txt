KOLKATA: Pilots who flew into Kolkata airport or out of here on Thursday morning were in for a surprise. Between 7am and 1pm, all controllers at the other end of the communication channel were women. Six women — assistant general manager (air traffic management) Anindita Paul, manager Meena Kumari and junior executives Sulagna Bhattacharya, Priya Banik, Moumita Sarkar and Haimanti Sengupta — managed the 147 flights between 7am to 1pm. The communication, navigation & surveillance (CNS) wing also had an allwomen team during this period.

 Usually, two, or at most three, women ATCOs are at the tower on any given shift. On Wednesday, though, it was different with only women rostered to do the job during the busy morning hours. And they performed the duty with ease.
 
 “The   tower was ‘manned’ by an all-women team as a symbolic gesture to celebrate Women’s Day. This is one job where there really is no difference between men and women. We work shoulder-to-shoulder daily, handling emergencies and other high-pressure situations. But it is fun to have only women around,” said  , the senior-most female   here.
 
 Though only one out of eight ATCOs are women in Kolkata (41of 272), instructors and veterans say women usually perform better as they have a better temperament. “They don’t get too excited or lose their cool quickly,” an instructor said.
 
 The job of controllers is very challenging and demands utmost alertness, promptness, high levels of concentration, skill, expertise and presence of mind.
