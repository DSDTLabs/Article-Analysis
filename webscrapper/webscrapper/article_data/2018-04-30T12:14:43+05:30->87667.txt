Bengaluru:  , who was dropped at 7 by M Ashwin off Yuzvendra Chahal, anchored the innings nicely with an unbeaten 62 (52 balls, 7x4, 1x6) as Kolkata Knight Riders inflicted a six-wicket loss on Royal Challengers Bangalore in an   match on Sunday night. Needing 176 for victory,   reached the target in 19.1 overs. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Opener   (27) and Robin Uthappa (36) played fine supporting hands for KKR while skipper   provided the finishing touches with a 10-ball 23.
 
 When Karthik asked the home side to bat first, he knew he had to turn to his spinners to give them a flying start. The ball didn’t come on to the bat and RCB’s openers Quinton de Kock and Brendon McCullum didn't exactly set the packed park on fire. They struggled and relied heavily on loose balls to score, but they persevered. After the openers were sent back by birthday boy Andre Russell (3-31), skipper   not only steadied the ship, but he also pushed the scoring rate up as his 44-ball-68 propelled the hosts to a competitive 175/4.
 
 
 
 
 On a wicket which was slower than the previous games, the spinners — Piyush Chawla, Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav — did well to contain Bengaluru’s openers.   ended the powerplay with 40 runs on board and more dot balls than they should have had.
 
 The team clearly missed the services of their red-hot batsman AB de Villiers who was ruled out of the contest due to viral fever.
 
 While KKR chose to go with an unchanged squad, RCB made plenty of changes.
