Flying kicks, twists in the air and many other high-octane stunts by   sum up the just-released teaser of ' ', but if you’ve watched the 91-second trailer keenly, you couldn’t have missed the picturesque backdrop. A big chunk of the   directorial was shot across scenic locales of Portugal, and that’s a first for South films, says Balayya’s leading lady,  .
“It’s the story of a girl, who works in Portugal, and the incidents that take place in her life,” says Shriya, speaking for the first time about the movie. “The makers zeroed in on the country for its stunning locations. Such locales were never captured or explored in any South Indian film earlier,” she points out.
 In fact, the actress was so beguiled by Portugal’s beauty that she decided to extend her stay after wrapping up the film’s shoot. Holidaying in the Iberian Peninsula always featured on her to-do list, and this experience reminded   of Goa. 
 “I travelled extensively across that European country. I am absolutely besotted with the Portuguese bridges and ports. The beaches are spotless, quiet and heavenly. I also got to witness a colourful festival in its capital, Lisbon, where thousands of people took to the streets. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I treated myself to the famed green wine that the Portuguese have popularised, and binged on the delicious local cuisine,” she says, adding that the highlight of her impromptu vacay was a road trip from Lisbon to Barcelona.
