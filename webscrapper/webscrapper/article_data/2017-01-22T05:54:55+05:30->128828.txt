NOIDA: It was a harrowing day for commuters on   on Saturday as a 400 strong crowd of   workers virtually laid siege to the four lanes of the flyway in the name of welcoming the party's Noida candidate  . In the end, the party invited the wrath of many voters who routinely take the flyway and landed in a mess with cops filing an FIR against the candidate and seizing his vehicle.

 According to sources, the SP workers started gathering near the toll plaza as early as 10.30 am to welcome Chaudhary . Nearly 100 vehicles also lined up along the flyway . Till 11.15, the workers remained on one side of the flyway. Fifteen minutes before Chaudhary's arrival around 11.30 am, the workers covered the four lanes at right side with nearly 30 workers occupying the middle of the flyway . When Chaudhary arrived around 11.30 am, nearly 100 workers crossed the toll booths and reached his cavalcade. The police, meanwhile, reached the spot only at 11.40 am and started videographing the incident soon after their arrival.
 
 Pankaj Parikh, who was travelling from Delhi to his office in Film City , asked a worker why the lanes of DND were blocked by them. “I asked them the reason but they said an SP leader is coming. I was not expecting a jam at this point. It was so disappointing,“ he told TOI.
 
 SP (City)   said that details of all the vehicles which participated in the gathering have been collected and will be sent to the district election officer so that whatever expenditure was incurred, could be added to the party's election expenditure.
