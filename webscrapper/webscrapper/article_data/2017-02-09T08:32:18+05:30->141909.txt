PANAJI: Accepting octogenarian Timoteo Fernandes’ suggestions, the   has decided to change the route for the annual carnival in Panaji and will hold it along the Miramar to   road.

  Fernandes has been on the state-level carnival committee since 1967. He was also Goa’s first King Momo.
 
 To be held on February 25, the Carnival float parade, which will be celebrating its golden jubilee, will see floats line up along the road that traces the Miramar beach coastline, said commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji, Dipak Dessai.
 
  “Since there is a code of conduct in force there are no political leaders on the organizing committee. We have formed a screening committee and we have asked that all floats adhere to the RTO norms,” Dessai said.
 
  Earlier the floats used to start from the old secretariat and culminate at Kala Academy, Campal. This required several traffic diversions and caused heavy traffic congestion. The last date for floats to apply to participate in the Carnival parade is February 23.
 
 Once the float parade begins, no city buses or heavy transport will be allowed to ply along the Miramar-Dona Paula road till the Carnival parade is completed.
 
 The restrictions would apply to tourist buses coming into the city and heading towards Dona Paula.
 
  Dessai, who is also the chairman of the carnival organizing committee for Panaji, said that the screening committee would meet on Monday to deliberate further on the norms for the annual carnival parade.
 
 Fernandes had written to the director of tourism in November 2016, suggesting the carnival parade route be shifted from the present Panaji route to the Dona Paula-Miramar-Campal road. He stated the advantages of the new route would help children and adults view the parade peacefully, and make it less congested for tourists.
