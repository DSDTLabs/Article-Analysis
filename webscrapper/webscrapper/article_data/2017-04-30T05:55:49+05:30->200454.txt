CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered that all   students who wrote the   on March 31, and attempted question number 16 in Section A of Part II, should be awarded one mark each, as all answers for the   question were incorrect.

 Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, passing orders on a batch of petitions, asked the director of government examinations to take necessary steps to award one mark each for students, and/or recompute the marks if the evaluation is already done.
 
 “In the interest of the career of students, marks have to be awarded. Though that should be only an exception, unfortunately, the exception has become a rule. Therefore, the authorities have to be careful in setting the question papers,” said Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana.
 
 Petitioners said that according to the text book, the correct answer for the question was 85% to 90%, but the multiple choice answers did not have this right answer at all. When it was pointed out to authorities, they said students ought to have ticked the ‘most suitable’ answer which was 80 or 90%. They said no mark could be awarded for those who had not ticked option (a).
 
 However, the judge pointed out that the Key Preparation Committee filed an affidavit in the court stating that the correct option for the question is 85% to 90% which is not given as one of the four alternatives in the question paper.
