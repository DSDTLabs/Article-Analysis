PANAJI: Thanks to global warming, Antartica, which once boasted an icy landscape, is seeing a growth of green vegetation. And every time one chooses to use a plastic straw on this side of the globe, he or she becomes part of the problem, says 21-year-old Sarthak  , a fourth year dual-degree programme student of BITS   campus,  .

 “The impact of our actions here can clearly be seen in Antartica. You can see the ice melting, with chunks floating away from the plate,” he says.
 
 Singh was among a handful of Indians to be chosen for the annual ClimateForce:   2018 Expedition led by  , the first person to walk on both, the North and South Pole. 
 
 “The real threat is that we feel that someone else will save planet earth. You will barely find any students from any of the country’s prestigious institutes of higher education opting for a career as a climate change scientist,” says Singh.
 
 Besides acting as an ambassador for climate change at his college campus, Singh will also speak to students from all three BITS Pilani campuses about the impact of global warming he witnessed on his Antartica visit. Singh expects to influence a total of 12,000 students at the BITS University itself.
 
 “Each one of use is responsible, directly or indirectly, for a huge carbon footprint. Fifty years down the line, our water sources will be so contaminated that we will be consuming the plastic we have dumped into them,” says Singh. 
 
 He says that the pledge to be a climate change warrior is a life-long commitment. He will now be part of a mission launched by Indian origin participants of Swan’s expedition to light up houses in high altitude villages in India with renewable energy sources.
 
 Singh was chosen after undergoing a rigourous selection process, which included writing four essays and answering two interviews. He was selected after beating dozens of students from India, including some from BITS University.
