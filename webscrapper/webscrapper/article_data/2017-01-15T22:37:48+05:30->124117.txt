MUMBAI: After reaching the finish line of a 41kilometres-run, normally one would stagger to the recovery zone, stretch the overworked muscles, then maybe grab an energy drink and finally collect the medal you get after completing the run. If you are 64 years old, you would definitely want to follow the aforementioned steps.
 
 Ariez   is an exception. After completing the full marathon in 4 hours and 50 minutes on Sunday, the senior citizen went about happily congratulating fellow runners, asking the injured if they needed help, and even offered to ice a young runner's ankle.
  
 As he walked to the recovery zone, he was greeted by his group of young runners who called him 'Santa'. "It's because of my white beard that I have that nickname. And also because I like to spread happiness," he said when TOI caught up with him.
  
  
  
 
 Walking towards the Bombay Gymkhana for breakfast, a friend noticed that Kharas hadn't collected his medal. "My wife told me not to come with a medal because I don't need a weight to prove that I ran. I have ten of them lying around at home anyway," he said.
  
 What is it that drives him to run? "Have you seen a runner sad? It's healthy and fun, especially when you run in a group. Earlier, I used to cycle long distances and go hiking too. So I guess running is basically trying to make up for that," he said, adding that he has run marathons in Delhi and Leh. The   resident still rates Mumbai as the best though.
  
 "Mumbai is home. Plus, so many familiar faces come to cheer us," he said with a smile.
