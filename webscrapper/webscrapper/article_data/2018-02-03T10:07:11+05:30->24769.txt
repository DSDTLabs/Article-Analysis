NAGPUR: On a day when accountants were busy computing the highs and lows of the Union Budget, city’s chess prodigy   was calculating his chess moves. Around 8156 kms away from the city, the 12-year-old chess master scored his second high of the 2017-18 financial year.

 
 Exactly six months after he cleared his first International Master (IM) norm in Czech Republic, Raunak completed his second IM norm at the Gibraltar Masters Chess Festival on Thursday night. To become an IM, a player is required to clear three norms and maintain a rating 2400 Elo points.
 
 Raunak made his presence felt in the ten-round tournament at Gibraltar that attracted a strong field of 276 masters from across 50 countries. The 276 participants saw as many 208 title holders including 92 Grandmasters and 66 IMs.
 
 Starting as a lowly 162nd seed with a rating of 2321, Raunak collected 4.5 points to finish the event at 159th spot and importantly earn a performance rating of 2445 Elo points. 
 
 Raunak, who dreams to become "country’s strongest GM like V Anand" surprised a couple of higher rated masters and forced five of his experienced rivals to settle for a draw. Despite suffering three defeats he came closer to become city’s second IM after Anup Deshmukh. In 1999, Deshmukh became city’s first IM.
 
 In a chat with TOI, Raunak said, “Yes, I did it and one more to go to become an IM. I will soon achieve it. In fact, I could have beaten GM Khotenashvili Bela of Georgia but missed a move and settled for a draw. I feel my best win came against Spanish IM Almagro Llamas Pablo.”
 
 City’s only IM Deshmukh was all praise for Raunak. He said, “Raunak is a natural and rare talent. Raunak will surely become youngest GM from Maharashtra. If he continues to surprise world’s top GMs Raunak has all the ingredients in him to challenge   and I wish this happens in near future.”
 
 Raunak’s coach and Vidarbha’s only GM Swapnil Dhopade said, “Raunak played very well. He already has what it takes to be a IM but he used to get nervous so couldn’t achieve the norm. But this time he made it and I think the IM title is not too far from Raunak.”
 
 Raunak, a student of Centre Point School, Katol Road, added, “I am quite satisfied with the quality of games but still wish to improve and learn a lot. I will keep on working hard consistently. I want to fulfill my dream of becoming country’s top GM just like Anand sir.”
 
 Parents Bharat and Heena Sadhwani were on top of the world. Mother Heena who is with Raunak said, "We are super happy on our son's achievement, quite satisfying results of his hard work. He played fantastic chess that too with the very strong opposition, in the world's strongest open tournament. We are super proud of him. It’s just a beginning, many more to come. I am very much sure that soon he will achieve his last IM norm and cross the first milestone and become the International Master.
 
 Having cleared his first IM norm on July 31 and scored his second on the budget day, in form Raunak is on the verge of achieving his target of becoming state’s youngest IM in the 2017-18 fiscal itself.
