Chandigarh: Come September 23, Panjab Universityâ€™s decision-making body, the  , is going to take up the matter of giving concessions to the wards of   for admissions in the 2017-18 academic year.

 The concession for the wards of Kashmiri migrants includes increase in intake capacity up to 5% course-wise, relaxation in cut-off percentage up to 10% and reservation of at least one seat in merit quota in technical/professional institutions. However, the university, in anticipation, has already extended concessions to the wards of Kashmiri migrants from the 2017-18 session. Since it requires a nod from the governing bodies of the university, this will be taken up for ratification in the syndicate meeting scheduled for September 23.
 
 The move has come on directions from the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD), which ordered that a relaxation in cut-off percentage of up to 10% subject in minimum eligibility requirement should be given to the wards of Kashmiri migrants. MHRD also conveyed to increase the intake of Kashmiri migrant students up to 5% course-wise. MHRD also wants reservation of at least one seat in merit quota in technical/professional institutions for the wards of Kashmiri migrants.
 
 In a letter directed to the vice-chancellors of all universities, UGC had informed the universities to implement the order. The decision to give relaxation to the children of Kashmiri migrants was deliberated upon in a meeting chaired by DAV College, Chandigarh, principal and PU fellow B C Josan on May 2 earlier this year. As per the UGC notification, the domicile requirement should also be waived for Kashmiri students.
 
 In 2013, the syndicate had rejected a proposal sent by the MHRD regarding admissions of wards of Kashmiri migrants. At that time, syndicate members felt there was no need for further relaxation.
