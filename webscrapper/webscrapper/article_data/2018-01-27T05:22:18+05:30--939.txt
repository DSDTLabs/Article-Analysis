QUEENSTOWN: India put up an all-round show to hammer   by 131 runs on Friday to set-up an ICC Under-19 World Cup semifinal against arch-foes Pakistan. India rode on   (86), Abhishek Sharma (50) and   (40) to get to 265 in 49.2 overs at the   Oval.

 In reply, Bangladesh were bowled out for 134 in 42.1 overs, thanks to pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti (3/18) and Shivam Mavi (2/27). Left-arm spinner Abhishek Sharma picked up two wickets for 11.
 
 Electing to bat, India lost Manjot Kalra(9) early to Robiul Haque before Shaw and Gill built a formidable partnership to steady the innings. Their stand of 86 runs however ended when captain Shaw was beaten by a peach of a delivery, which cut away to take the off stump, from Qazi Oni. But at the other end, Gill went on with the job lacing his innings with nine boundaries before he departed with 14 overs to go.
 
 After his dismissal, India failed to recover from a collapse as incoming batsmen â€” Riyan Parag (15), Kamlesh Nagarkoti (5), Anukul Roy (2), Shivam Mavi (5), Sharma
 
 (50) and Shiva Singh (3) departed for just 50 runs. Onik was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers taking 3/48 from his 10 overs.
 
 In reply, Bangladesh got off to a cautious start with opener Pinak Ghosh topscoring with a watchful 45. But Nagarkoti (3/18) was fantastic once again along with Mavi and Sharma to skittle out Bangladesh for just 134. Nagarkoti removed Ghosh and skipper Saif Hassan in two overs just when they were looking to build a partnership.
