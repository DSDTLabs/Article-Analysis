RANCHI: Despite being granted a six-week provisional bail,   Lalu Prasad had to spend Monday night in   because the formalities for his release could not be completed.

 
 His lawyer Prabhat Kumar said the ailing leader may be released on Tuesday once the formalities are completed after the bail order reaches the special CBI court conducting thetrial.
 
 On Monday, the RJD chief surrendered before the prison administration on expiry of his parole period. Lalu, who has been convicted in four fodder scam cases, was on a parole for three days to attend his sonâ€™s marriage in Patna. Lalu reached Ranchi around 4pm on Monday and headed for the Birsa Munda jail amid tight security. At the jail, he completed the paperwork and formalities related to his surrender, hoping to be released soon after. However, that did not happen.
 
 Lalu was granted a six-week provisional bail on May 11, a day after he left Ranchi on parole, to receive treatment at specialised medical institutes for a host of ailments he claimed he had been suffering.
