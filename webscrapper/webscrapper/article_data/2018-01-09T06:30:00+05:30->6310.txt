Hubballi: Rotary Saraswati Vidyalaya, an   run by Rotary Mid Town Education and Welfare Society, has adopted “No Bag Day” to make learning stress-free. Students here are involved in gardening, painting, singing, quiz, storytelling, clay modelling and games every Saturday. Even teachers enjoy the day as they are getting an opportunity to interact with children freely.

 Speaking to TOI, Lingaraj Patil, the school chairman, said that idea was pitched when the Uttar Pradesh government decided to celebrate “No Bag Day”. “We started this initiative on a pilot basis in November. We collected opinions from students, teachers and parents and even observed positive changes among students towards the learning process. Consolidating all outputs, we formally inaugurated ‘No Bag Day’ last Saturday,” he said.
 
 S K Nadig, school administrative officer, said that students look more enthusiastic on Saturdays as they get scope to showcase their hidden talent. Headmistress Keerti Deshpande said students who were average or below-average, are now performing better in studies. “With ‘No Bag Day’, all are getting equal opportunity,” she said.
 
 Supreet Janevari, a class 9 student, and Sanjana Gayakawad of class 7 said that they are feeling proud to get involved in activities like watering saplings and cleaning the premises on Saturdays. The students said that the school has become another home for them. Parents Sudhakar Khatawkar and Kallanagouda Halemani noted that their wards are showing development in curricular and extracurricular activities.
 
 “We were surprise to see that students themselves conducted all activities like welcoming, master of ceremony, anchoring, vote of thanks and there was hardly role or guidance of teachers,” said  , MLA, Hubballi-Dharwad (West).
