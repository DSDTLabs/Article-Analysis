The prison walls at the   resounded with Zakir Hussain’s tabla beats as he interacted and performed for the inmates on Friday afternoon. But the highlight of the day was when jailer   performed on Hussain’s tabla after she confessed that she was an avid fan and is a trained musician.

 Starry-eyed post the performance, Powar confessed, “I can’t believe Ustad Zakirji invited me on stage to perform on his tabla. A few years ago, I had begged for a pass to see him perform. I am overwhelmed that I got this opportunity to not only sit next to him, but also perform on the maestro’s tabla. It is the best day of my life.” She added that this was an impromptu performance and she had not practiced for a year and a half because of rigorous training for the prison department. Powar said, “Ustadji appreciated my performance and told me I need a bit more practice.”
 
  
  
 
 Hussain interacted with the inmates and the officers and kept narrating stories which were then translated into his beats. Before signing off, the maestro addressed the inmates and said, “I wish we get an opportunity to meet outside these walls. We shall meet in your city or mine, at some performance where there will be no walls and we will chat over a cup of tea.”
 
 The event was organised by   along with Maharashtra Prison Department as part of their rehabilitation programme 'Prernapath’.
