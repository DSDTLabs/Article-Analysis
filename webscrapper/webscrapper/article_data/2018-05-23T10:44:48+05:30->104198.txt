JAIPUR: Green activist Ajay   on Tuesday filed a complaint against the state forest officials at the National   Conservation Authority ( ), after a video of tiger MT- 1 was allegedly uploaded on Facebook by a Kota resident. 

 In the complaint, Dubey has mentioned that the uploaded video is disclosing the location and whereabouts of tiger MT-1 on social networking site, which is a violation of NTCA advisory issued on June 17, 2017. He further alleged that images and videos uploaded by the user were provided by the senior officials of forest department and requested NTCA to investigate the matter. 
 
 The NTCA last year had taken a serious note and expressed fear that sharing of crucial information regarding the big cats might pose a threat to the animals from poachers. The authority had also written to all tiger states in the country to stop the big cats’ locations from being shared on social media.
 
 The letter reads, “This authority has received information of tiger photographs as well as camera trap pictures circulating on WhatsApp groups and Facebook, which are highlighting the animals’ location. This information has (the) potential of being used for committing wildlife crimes. It is requested that no such photographs or information be shared on WhatsApp groups or Facebook.”
