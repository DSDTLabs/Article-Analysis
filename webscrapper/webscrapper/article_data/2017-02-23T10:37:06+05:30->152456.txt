RANCHI: Mayor   on Wednesday alleged Ranchi Municipal Corporation ( ) of corruption worth crores of rupees in the name of installing   cameras.

 Lakra while addressing the media said, RMC officials are trying to favour a private company by not following proper methods of floating a tender. 
 
 She said, “The officials have been trying to favour Brite Neon Sign Pvt Ltd for a very long time. Initially, the private company was given the permission to use RMC hoardings in lieu of installing LED lights across the city. Now that the work of LED installation has been given to another company, the officials are trying to handover the work of   installation to them.”
 
 Lakra accused that officials did not use a proper channel before floating the tender for CCTV installation and gave a letter of approval (LoA) to Brite. 
 
 “According to the rules, the tender needs to be approved by the procurement committee before being floated but this was not done. Nobody got to know when the tender was floated and the company was selected without prior consultation,” Mayor said.
 
 She also added that the company is not competent to install CCTV cameras. “Anyone can put up hoardings but installation of CCTV cameras require experts and the company has no experience in this field. This only shows that their favouritism towards Brite,” said Lakra. 
 
 The mayor also announced that she will be approaching the urban development department on this issue.
