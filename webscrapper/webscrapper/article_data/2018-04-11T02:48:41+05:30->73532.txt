NAVI MUMBAI: From May 1, expect fewer traffic snarls on   near port premises due to   as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust will roll out an   through four logistic companies that have won the bid for five routes as part of direct port delivery (DPD) scheme. 

 This means importers can book online transport of their cargo directly from the port with   on the port premises itself. “There’s a time limit to lift the cargo within 48 hours from the port premises,” said Vikas Jain, a partner of Ekta Enterprises that has won the bid for the Mumbai and suburbs route. With the DPD system in place, around 200 container trailers and trucks that transport import cargo from JNPT, the nation’s biggest container cargo port, to industrial hubs in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and their suburbs daily will not clog the highway for the mandatory customs clearances at the   (CFS). Congestion of trucks on NH 348 and NH 348A stretch near   slows down vehicular movement at D point towards the Goa highway.
 
 Around 30% of 2.4 million teus of imported cargo annually is for Mumbai region, which comprises Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane.
 
 The DPD scheme allows importers/consignees to take delivery of the containers directly from the port terminals and haul them to factories without taking them first to a CFS and from there to factories. An importer is thus assured clearance of cargo in less than 48 hours under DPD, as against several days stretching up to a week if routed through a CFS. —Sanjay Banerjee
