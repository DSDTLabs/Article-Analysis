Noida: One of the two   Ponzi partners was inspired by Anubhav Mittal’s ‘like’  . Sandesh Verma, one of the two directors of Webwork, revealed that he had subscribed to three IDs in Mittal’s  , and then founded Webwork Trade Links. Anurag Garg (35) and Verma (30), directors of the company, were arrested on Friday when they had gone to meet Dharmendra Singh, SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar, at his Surajpur office.

 Verma had subscribed to three IDs in Mittal’s Social Trade scheme. “Verma had invested the money and also received some returns from the scheme. He then decided to launch a similar company to run a Ponzi scheme and earn money,” a police officer said.
 
 Garg, who is from Nehru Nagar in Meerut, had done his BBA from a private college. He later shifted to Crossings Republik in Ghaziabad and was involved in real estate business from 2001 to 2016. Verma, a resident of Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi, had finished Class XI and then a diploma in jewellery designing from Diamond Institute in Gujarat. When Verma came in contact with Garg last year over a real estate deal, he shared the idea of the ‘like’ scheme with Garg. The two then started the company — Webwork Trade Links Pvt Ltd — on September 5, 2016.
 
 Dinesh Yadav, SP (city) Noida, said Garg and Verma roped in around 40,000 people and issued 69,000 IDs. “The company a policy of issuing a maximum of three IDs to one investor,” he said. The investors were called ‘publishers’ as they were asked to ‘publish/like’ advertisements on their phone, similar to the ‘like’ scam of Mittal.
