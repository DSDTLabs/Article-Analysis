AGRA: The   (AMC) administration has sought clarification from a private consultant for irregularities and delay in the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) that it was tasked with preparing for the proposed smart city projects in Agra.
 
  
  
  The nodal officer for smart city development projects, RK Singh, found wrong estimates and technical errors in DPRs prepared by the private consultant, named   private limited. Singh said, “Besides the slow pace of their work, several irregularities have surfaced in the six DPRs that the private consultant has prepared so far. The consultant has not been able to provide technical expertise for beautification of the Fatehabad road, upgradation of drainage systems, development of pathways between the eastern and western gates of the Taj Mahal. Unnecessary expenditure was added in the DPR for beautification of 122 road crossings. We have raised all these issues with the project officer appointed by the consultant and sought clarification within three days. In case they don’t respond by Wednesday, action will be taken against the company.”

Agra was selected for the smart city scheme in September 2016. By December 2017, 70 DPRs were to be submitted for approval, so that actual work could start, but only six have been prepared till date.
  
  
  
  A special purpose vehicle (SPV) was constituted and registered under the Companies Act. Named “Agra Smart City Limited”, it is headed by the divisional commissioner and is responsible for planning, appraising, approving, releasing funds, implementing, managing, operating, monitoring and evaluating the smart city developmental projects. In September 2017, the SPV had tasked the private consultancy company, Darashaw private limited, with preparing DPRs of 91 work proposals.
