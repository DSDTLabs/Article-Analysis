PATNA: Leader of opposition in   assembly   on Friday blamed   Mohan Bhagwat for the recent communal clashes in some parts of the state. 

 “Bhagwat, who recently toured Bihar for 14 days, trained his volunteers on how to incite violence. He returned from the state only after designing the recent incidents,”   told reporters here. He added as the state witnessed a series of communal clashes in the recent days, people have understood Bhagawat’s “agenda” in Bihar.
 
 Though Tejashwi claimed Bhagwat stayed in the state for 14 days, the   chief’s visit to the state had actually lasted for 10 days. During his 10-day stay commencing from February 5, Bhagwat gave one of the most controversial statements in Muzaffarpur when he said the army takes six-month time to get battle ready, but the RSS has the capacity to form an army within three days to fight against the enemy on the other side of the border.
 
 Although Bhagwat’s statement had sparked a nationwide outrage, CM Nitish Kumar had defended him. While terming the RSS an “organisation of citizens”, Nitish had said, “If any organisation is saying that it is ready for protection of the country’s border, what should I comment? I do not think any sort of controversy in it. I am, however, not fully aware about the whole episode.”
