JAIPUR: Rajasthan is heading for deep   crises not due to fluctuating monsoon, but due to shunning of traditional practices using and conserving water. Every village household till a century or some decades ago had its own water conservation system by effectively using used domestic water for cleaning clothes, irrigation. Lastly, accumulating the wastewater in a small hole in the end, say experts at a two conference Conversation for conservation held at   on Saturday.

 Experts discussed that hazardous effect of releasing chemical laced water from household making the water unfit for any use. The traditional methods use natural things like sand for utensils and salts for washing clothes. “The heavy usage of chemicals for everything—washing utensils, clothes and even waste food is making the water not usable,” said  , head, department of Rajasthan Studies, RU. 
 
 A study on water bodies in Jaipur was discussed says that 50% of the water bodies have not only dried up but have lost to the real estate mafias. “The existing water bodies are so polluted that even its flora and fauna struggle to survive. Needless to think about its any consumption by the residents. Despite laws in place the effluents from the homes and small time units are directly flowing into the water bodies,” added Sharma. 
 
 The Magsaysay award winner   has advocated that unless communities will be roped in for saving water, the situation will never improve. “The main stakeholder—people have to become sensitive towards saving water. Every village has to become self-sufficient in meeting their needs,” said Singh who is popularly known as water-man of India. He shared several examples of how communities have step forward and attain self-sufficiency in water consumption.
 
 The experts opined that a nationwide campaign accumulating rain water should be run. The water accumulated during the monsoon can run for the year in most parts of India.
