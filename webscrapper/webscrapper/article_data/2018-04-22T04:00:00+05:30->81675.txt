Rajkot: A lion carcass was found near Samadhiyala-2 of Khambha taluka in Amreli on Saturday. This is the second lion death in last two weeks. However, forest officials said nothing suspicious was found near the carcass and a detailed investigation has been ordered.

 Forest officials said the carcass was of a male lion about 4-year-old. It was found by some villagers, who informed the forest department.
 
 A senior forest official said, “We have found that lion was suffering from intense diarrhoea. This could be cause of the death. Other reason could be dehydration and sun stroke or food poisoning. We have sent the samples for forensic testing and are awaiting the result.” 
 
 The forest officials said they did not find anything suspicious, which could lead them to believe that lion is intentionally killed.
 
 This is second lion death in two weeks in Khambaha taluka. Earlier, a lion carcase was found in Saragadia village. It had died due to snake bite.
