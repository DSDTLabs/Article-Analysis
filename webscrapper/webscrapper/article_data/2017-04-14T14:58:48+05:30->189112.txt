 has paid a tribute to her late mother   as she attended a   Celebration event. 

 The 24-year-old actress remembered her late mother - who was famed for playing the Rebel Alliance leader Princess Leia - at the event in Orlando, Florida and spoke of the similarities between the 'Star Wars' character and her late mother.
 
  
  
 
 "My mom used to say she never knew where Princess Leia ended and Carrie Fisher began. She was imperfect in many ways but her imperfections and willingness to speak about them are what made her more than perfect," Billie said. 
 
 "My mom, like Leia, wasn't ever afraid to speak her mind and say things that might have made most people uncomfortable. (She was) the strong soldier of a woman who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side to fight, whatever it may be. But she knew that it wasn't about the fight you were fighting but how you fought it - the way you resisted. 
 
 "She taught me by her own example, that the most evolved person is seemingly a contradiction - they are both the strongest and the most vulnerable person in the room. And that was her. That is Leia."
