PUNE: A group of 13   travelling to the city from   was allegedly   in   airport on Wednesday after they missed their   because of late arrival of their plane in the national capital.

 Mayuraish Dandaicar, one of the passengers, said they were travelling from Lucknow to Delhi on a Jet flight and then had to travel to Pune. “The flight from Lucknow was delayed and it took off at 4.30pm instead of 3.40pm. For around half-an-hour, we sat in the aircraft before it took off and reached Delhi at 5.45pm. Our flight to Pune from Delhi at 5.30pm had left by then,” he told TOI from Delhi.
 
 A source said the delay was because of ATC congestion. According to Dandaicar, a corporate trainer, the 13 people included senior citizens, women and a kidney patient.
 
 “We requested the airline to accommodate us in another flight. Its officials flatly said we would be adjusted in a 9.30pm flight. They told us we could opt for the same or take the refund. There was an Air India flight to Pune but they deliberately delayed things and said its check-in was over. We were not offered any refreshments, not even water,” he said.
 
 Dandicar said the passengers in the group and they were told to wait in a lounge belonging to the internal transfer desk of the airport. “We refused it and demanded that we should be allowed to wait in a proper lounge and given refreshments. We wanted to talk to some senior Jet Airways official at the airport, but in vain. It was very humiliating indeed,” Mayuraish said.
 
 The spokesperson of the Jet Airways said, “These are the basic facts. All the guests were offered the 9W363 flight from Delhi to Pune, scheduled to take-off at 9.30pm. All the guests were offered refreshment while waiting to board the Pune flight.”
