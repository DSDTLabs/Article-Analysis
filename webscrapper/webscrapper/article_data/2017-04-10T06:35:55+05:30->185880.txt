MUMBAI: Two years after a 35-year-old woman lost her legs after falling from a train at   while trying to catch a thief who had snatched her purse, the Bombay high court has directed the railways to decide on granting the Secunderabad resident,  , compensation. 

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice   has given the railways time till April 17 this year, to inform the court of its decision. "The basic issue is about the failure of the railways to provide security to passengers travelling on a train which was to undertake a night journey," said the judges. 
 
 The bench admonished the railways, which had opposed a petition, claiming that Sejal would approach the Railway Accidents Claims Tribunal. "Knowing fully well that Sejal [Ladola] will not get compensation under the Railways Act, a technical stand has been taken that she can approach the tribunal," the bench said.
 
 Ladola was travelling alone to meet her husband and other family members who were in Surat to attend a weeding. The family was travelling by   when the train halted at Khandala station on February 9, 2015 around 3 am. Ladola who was sleeping on the lower berth woke up with a start when she realised that some one had grabbed the purse that she had kept under her head. The thief started running and Ladola chased him, alighting from the train. She was running on the platform when she realized that the train had started moving. She tried to get in and fell into a wide gap between the train and the platform and the train ran over her legs. She was taken to the hospital and lost both her legs in the accident.
 
 In her petition, she claimed that the railways had not made any arrangement to protect passengers and their articles on trains during night journeys. She sought reimbursement of the medical expenditure that she has incurred. 
 
 The court observed that a first information report had been filed in the case and a report by a doctor who treated Ladola had confirmed the incident.
