 “The exercise is aimed at training troops in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations under the United Nations mandate. The joint exercise will enhance defence co-operation and military relations between the nations. It is an ideal platform for the armies of both nations to share their experiences and gain mutually. The training encompasses aspects like convoy protection, room-intervention drills and ambush/counter-ambush drills,” a senior officer in Eastern Command said.
