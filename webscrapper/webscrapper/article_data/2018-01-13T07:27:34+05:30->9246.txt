COIMBATORE: A city police team, formed to nab the mastermind behind the sensational ATM burglary in the city in December, returned empty handed from Nuh district in   on Friday. 

 The sleuths, led by assistant commissioner of police (crime-west sub-division) K  , were in pursuit of Aslam and his wife   from Nuh, who led an eight-member gang to steal Rs 30 lakh from two ATMs on   on the night of December 9, 2017. 
 
 According to police sources, the couple went into hiding after sensing the presence of police. “They switched off their mobile phones and moved to some undisclosed location. As some relatives of the burglars are working in the Haryana police department, we could not reveal all the information to the local police. However, we have established some sources in the state and will nab the couple soon,” a senior police officer said.
 
 In December, the city police had nabbed eight ATM burglars with the help of   district and   city police and seized two cars, a truck and tools used for breaking the ATM machines. Police also seized Rs 3.03 lakh from the gang.
 
  The gang had handed over Rs 27 lakh to Aslam and Kiran, who managed to escape to Haryana. 
 
 Police sources said that Aslam and Kiran were involved in more than 20 similar cases across the country.
