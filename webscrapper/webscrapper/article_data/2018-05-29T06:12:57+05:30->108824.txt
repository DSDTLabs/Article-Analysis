CHENNAI: In an early morning raid at the   fruit market on Monday, seven tonnes of mangoes and two tonnes of papayas – all artificially ripened – were seized along with 3kg of ethylene, a ripening agent.

 
 During the four-hour operation that began at 4am, 58 shops were raided of which 33 were found to be using agents for artificial ripening of mangoes. Fruits worth ?4.8 lakh were disposed of at the Koyambedu biomethanization  , said officials involved in the raid.
 
 Several shopkeepers leave ethylene packets among the mangoes a few hours after the market closes for the night and remove them before it reopens in the morning, said an official. “So we decided to raid the market before it opened,” he added.
 
 To ripen papayas artificially, baking soda is dissolved in a 20-litre container of water and the fruits are exposed to the escaping carbon dioxide through holes in the vessel, the official added.
 
 “However, only 15% of the shops were found to employ such techniques. The rest were using ripening chambers to ripen fruits,” said a member of the market management committee.
 
 Traders admitted to using ethylene sachets but denied that they cause health issues. “The government should provide sufficient artificial ripening chambers if they do not allow such methods. We have not heard of any side-effects,” said a trader. Health officials, however, said the use of artificial ripening agents was known to cause digestion problems, nausea, and heartburn.
