Nashik: The civic administration received 18 objections on the voters’ list that was displayed at the divisional offices on Thursday. 

 Besides citizens, corporators Satish Kulkarni, Laxman Jaybhave, Kanhaiyya Salve and DG Surywanshi have also raised objections about the list.
 
 “The objections from citizens are mainly pertaining to change in their prabhags. They said their names have been included in prabhags which were not theirs. We received 18 objections on Friday. We had received 25 objections on an earlier list a few days ago. Some citizens said that certain portions did not belong to their prabhag,” said deputy municipal commissioner (administration) Vijay Pagar. 
 
 The list was made available at all the six divisional offices of the civic body and was also uploaded on its official website. Citizens can register objections till January 17 at the   headquarters or at the respective divisional offices.
 
 “We have prepared six squads led by deputy municipal commissioners, assistant director of town planning, audit and other departments with 20 to 25 staff in each of them. The squads will check all details in person and will submit a report to us. Based on this report we will take a decision,” Pagar said. 
 
 The civic elections are scheduled on February 21. The work on the voters’ list had begun months ago. Citizens were appealed to register their objections, including exclusion of names, and the final list was prepared accordingly. 
 
 “Now, citizens whose names are missing will not be able to get their names included as this is the final list. We will only be able to make changes with regard to names being included in different prabhags,” Pagar said.
