LONDON/NEW DELHI: Global banking giant   has disclosed being probed by tax authorities in India and several other countries for allegedly helping four Indians and their families evade tax. The bank said the investigation includes its Swiss and Dubai units. 

 It has also been approached by the regulatory and law enforcement agencies of various countries for information on persons and entities named in the leaked ‘Panama Papers’—which includes hundreds of Indians who have allegedly had indulged in tax violations through offshore tax havens with help of a Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca. 
 
 Disclosing the “tax-related investigations” in its latest annual report published last week, HSBC said it has set aside $773 million (over Rs 5,000 crore) as a provision for various tax- and money laundering-related matters. “There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact of these investigations and reviews. Due to uncertainties and limitations of these estimates, the penalties could differ significantly from the amount provided,” HSBC said, while adding that it is cooperating with the relevant authorities. 
 
 “Various tax administrations, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, France, Belgium, Argentina and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank and other HSBC companies in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money-laundering and unlawful cross-border banking solicitation,” it said. 
 
 The bank said the Indian tax authorities in 2015 had issued a summons to an HSBC company in India. “In August 2015 and November 2015, HSBC companies received notices issued by two offices of the Indian tax authority alleging that they had sufficient evidence to initiate prosecution against HSBC Swiss Private Bank and an HSBC company in Dubai for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four Indian individuals and/or families.
