Kansa's various ruthless policies, his death and the merry exploits of Krishna are enacted at 14 sites in Mathura and Gopapura. "During Dhanu Yatra, Kansa moves around the city, catches offenders on the streets and slaps fines on them. He also enters to the government offices and pulls up undisciplined officials.
