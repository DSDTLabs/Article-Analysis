GREATER NOIDA: A developer and his accomplice were arrested on Thursday for threatening a contractor to withdraw dues worth Rs 5 crore incurred during construction of a housing society in Crossings Republik.

 The accused were identified as Manoj Goyal, a resident of Sihani Gate, and his accomplice Shakir Hussain, who hails from Jagatpuri .
 
 Rajpal Singh Tomar, SHO of Ecotech III police station, said that action was taken on the basis of a complaint filed by the contractor, Ravindra Sharma, who is a resident of Ecotech III in  . 
 
 Sharma said Goyal had given him a contract for developing a housing project   in Crossings Republik. “I engaged some workers and bought construction material in 2014. Goyal needed to pay me Rs 5 crore as per the deal. However, he refused to clear the dues,” Sharma said.
 
 The complainant said that when he pressurised Goyal, he received a threat call from an unknown number. “The caller said he was a member of the Sunder Bhati gang. He threatened me with dire consequences and said I should forget the dues. Rather, the caller asked the contractor to arrange the same amount as extortion to ensure his safety,” said Hariom Sharma, investigating officer. The contractor then filed a complaint in Ecotech III police station.
 
 Police said Nagar is not associated with Sunder Bhati gang but said so to pressurise the complainant.
