Ahmedabad: After claiming that former minister and prime accused in the   massacre case, Dr Maya Kodnani, was busy helping a patient deliver a baby at the time of the rioting on February 28, 2002, her husband Dr Surendra Kodnani failed to supply evidence to substantiate his statement to the special court.

 
 As the prosecution continued to cross-examine Dr Kodnani further on Monday, he was expected to bring along books of account showing transactions related to the payment received from the patient, named Ilaben who delivered a male child at Maya’s hospital – Shivam Maternity & Surgical Nursing Home at Saijpur Tower — as well as payments made to her working partner Dr Dhaval Shah.
 
 Dr Kodnani, who appeared as a defence witness, had told the court that two women – Hasuben and Gurjarben – were working at Maya’s hospital and their salary payment would be mentioned in a ledger. However, when he came to the court for further deposition, he did not bring any ledger along.
 
 The witness supplied the vehicle registration book showing that the Kodnanis owned a Maruti Alto car in 2002.
 
 The prosecution has been maintaining that the patient, Ilaben, was helped in her delivery by Dr Shah and not by Maya. This contention was denied by Dr Kodnani. He maintained that since Dr Shah could not reach the hospital to attend to the emergency, Maya had to rush there from Sola Civil Hospital on the afternoon of February 28, 2002.
 
 On Monday, a former BJP councillor from Naroda, Dinesh K Makwana, deposed as a defence witness. He told the court that he called Maya at around 10.30am and she informed him that she was at Sola Civil Hospital.
 
 Eleven persons were killed in this incident, and 86 persons were arrested. Eight persons have died during the trial and one person was discharged. Seventy-seven persons are facing trial, including Maya, VHP leader Jaideep Patel and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi.
