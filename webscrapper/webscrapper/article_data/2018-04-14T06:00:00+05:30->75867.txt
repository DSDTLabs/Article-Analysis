Ranchi:   and   localities in the state capital are poles apart when it comes to political participation. While 31 candidates are vying for one post of ward councillor in ward 10 —comprising areas like Kokar and Lower Burdwan compound — only two candidates are there in the fray for ward 47 comprising Namkom region. 

 While people in most parts of the capital are complaining of the ongoing cacophony of campaign vehicles, the   in Kokar and Lower Burdwan compound are okay with the hustle bustle because every second family is an ardent supporter of one candidate or the other. “We are enjoying the competition going on among the candidates for attracting voters. If one plays a parody on Bollywood song the other comes out with a tribal folk song soon after,” said Pankaj Purohit a resident of Kokar Bazar. 
 
 Contrary to the hustle bustle in Kokar Bazaar region, the voters in ward 47 reserved for woman of scheduled tribe category have made up their mind to vote in favour of either. Kavita Sanga and Bina Tirkey. Like Namkom there are three wards – Kanke (1), Kadru (24) and Pandra region (33) —where there are only three candidates in the fray.
 
 Hatia region under ward 52, where the Heavy Engineering Corporation is located, has 24 candidates in the fray followed by ward 3 comprising New Area Morhabadi where as many as 22 candidates are locking horns with each other. 
 
 Political leaders believe that the wards that are unreserved has more candidates than those which are reserved for women and a particular category. “Hatia has been politically conscious and so is Kokar region but both these wards are unreserved,” said Congress nominee for deputy mayor’s post Rajesh Gupta.
