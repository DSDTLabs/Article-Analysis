GHAZIABAD: A man killed his   following a tiff over   on Thursday afternoon.

 The accused, Pankaj Sharma, attacked his friend Sandeep Sharma (28), with a knife and fled from the spot.
 
 “Two men, Sandeep and Pankaj, who were   near Chaupraula, got involved in a tiff over money and in a fit of rage Pankaj stabbed Sandeep to death,” said deputy superintendent of police Manisha Singh. “We are making efforts to arrest the accused,” said Singh. 
 
 A crowd gathered at the scene immediately after the incident and accused the police of arriving late. The protestors held up the traffic on GT Road for a brief time and got involved in a heated discussion with Singh.
 
 “After killing Sandeep, Pankaj tried to flee, but we caught and restrained him and in the meantime informed the police. But somehow he managed to escape again and this happened because the police arrived late at the scene,” said Sukhdev, a local resident.
 
 The police refuted the charges. “We reached the spot in about 10 minutes. The charge that we reached late is not true,” said Singh. “On the contrary angry locals got into an argument with police and even blocked the GT Road but we later managed to pacify them,” said Singh.
 
 An FIR has been lodged under Section 302 (murder)of IPC and efforts are being made to arrest the accused.
