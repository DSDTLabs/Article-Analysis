The actor ended up in a hand-to-hand scuffle outside the   in   on Monday evening. A  , on the condition of anonymity, lets in, “Pulkit’s attitude towards us photographers has always been condescending. In the last two years, we’ve had several episodes where he has misbehaved with us. We don’t intend to click him anymore. So far, nothing has been made official, but this kind of behaviour cannot continue.”

 The actor was in the court in connection with his divorce proceedings. He and his estranged wife   arrived a little past 1 pm and left around 4.30 pm. According to eyewitnesses, the actor tried to run to his car to escape the waiting cameras. When the photographers chased him, he got hold of one of them by the collar, threatened to end his career and hit him. 
 
 When we contacted Pulkit for his side of the story, he said, “After letting them take a couple of snapshots, I was heading back with my family when this photographer chased us. We requested him to let us pass, but he pushed my uncle and me and even abused us. That’s when I retaliated.”
