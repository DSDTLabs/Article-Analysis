KOLKATA: When fourth official   flashed four minutes of stoppage time on the board, the   bench as well as 7000-odd spectators ---who were jeering the players and berating club officials present at the ground right --- had all but resigned to another lacklustre stalemate at the   on Sunday.

  had not only held firm against Khalid Jamil’s side with verve and vigour until then, but could have also dealt a serious blow to the home side in the first minute of stoppage time. However, an unmarked Abhijit Sarkar – the Bengal star of India’s under-17 World Cup squad --- made a mess of substitute Suresh Singh Wangjam’s lay-off and shots traight at East Bengal goalkeeper Ubaid CK from handshaking distance.
 
 By them, angry spectators were already engaged in a war of words with petty club officials. But in the third minute of stoppage time, in came a long ball from Mohammad Rafique, who had replaced Jobby Justin in the 86th minute. It appeared to be another fruitless attempt by East Bengal to test the Arrows’ defence. Arrows goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill hesitated in going for the ball, leaving some space behind him. Dudu Omagbemi leapt up and met the ball with a desperate header, which looped in over the poorly-positioned Gill.
 
 The win helped East Bengal to reclaim the third place with 23 points from 13 matches while the Arrows remained on 11points from 14 matches.
 
 
 
 
 Imphal: NEROCA FC accomplished their goal of surging to the top of the I-League table as they defeated Gokulam Kerala by a solitary goal at Khuman Lampak Main Stadium here on Sunday. Liberian defender Varney Kallon Kiatamba scored two minutes before the breather which proved to be enough for the debutants to register all three points at home and unsettle Minerva Punjab FC at the top of standings.
 
 Coach Gift Raikhan decided not to disturb their winning combination which beat Churchill Brothers in the away game earlier this week.
