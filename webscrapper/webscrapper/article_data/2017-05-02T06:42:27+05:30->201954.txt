MUMBAI: The number of aspirants registered for   CET in the state this year has gone up to 39,000, an increase of almost 65% from last year's 23,838. 

 A single entrance for BEd admission was introduced last year. Earlier, there were three tests, one by the government and two by private colleges' associations.
 
 As last year it was the first time a single test was held, many were not aware of the centralised process and failed to register. Last year, only 12,000 of the 23,338 candidates participated in the centralised admission process. 
 
 "This year, the numbers have increased 65% due to awareness about the single test," an official from the state CET cell said.
 
 The number of aspirants is back to pre-2016 levels, said a teacher from a BEd college.
 
 The date of registration was extended till May 1. It was the last day for registration for three-year and five-year LLB CET too.
