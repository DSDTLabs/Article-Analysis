VADODARA: Burglars, robbers and thieves continues to remain a major challenge for the city police as there has been no let up in the number of such crimes in 2016. Burglaries, robberies and thefts increased in 2016 as compared to 2015, according to the city crime data of the police department. The police has intensified night patrolling but this seems to have a helped little in keeping the criminals at bay. 

 However, 2017 has begun on an encouraging note with chain snatching, thefts and burglaries going down significantly as compared to the same month last year. Motorbike patrolling has had a desired effect, senior police officials said. The incidents of chain snatching too have gone down from 12 in January last year to 2 in the same month this year. 
 
 Vadodara has a dubious distinction of being the ‘burglary capital’ of Gujarat. 
 
 “Night patrolling on motorbikes has helped in bringing down the incidents of crime. The patrolling teams visit different areas of the city in eight divisions on the bikes specially-fitted with LED lights. I monitor their movements every few days,” said Manoj Sashidhar, city police commissioner, . 
 
 He added that the cops are also going after gangs involved in chain-snatchings. While the number of burglaries have halved in January this year as compared to the same month last year, it still remains a cause of concern for the police as many gangs from the adjacent districts strike in the city and flee to their hometowns. The instances of robberies too have almost doubled in 2016. 
 
 Despite the increase in number of vehicles, the number of fatal accidents has gone down marginally. “We want to improve traffic engineering and focus on national highway 8 where the number of accidents is high,” Sashidhar said.
