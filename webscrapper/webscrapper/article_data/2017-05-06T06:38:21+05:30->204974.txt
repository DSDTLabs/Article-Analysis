INDORE: Amidst delay by over 100 private schools in registering the vacant seats under Right to Education ( ), the newly appointed district education officer of Indore struggles to remember the deadline for private schools to declare their seats. 

 According to schedule decided by the state education department, May 5 was the deadline for the private schools to get recognition for RTE admissions and declare the number of seats under the RTE admissions. While the online admissions under RTE will begin from May 15. 
 
 When questioned about the deadline for private schools to apply for recognition, Indore DEO S S Kaushal said, “The deadline for private schools is May 19 and the process is in progress. Every day 20-25 schools are being recognized for RTE and the work will be done in a few more days.”
 
 However, clarifying about the deadline for the private schools, the state RTE controller RK   said that May 5 was the deadline and the online admissions will being from May 15. 
 
 ‘If the admissions are scheduled to begin from May 15 how can the schools are recognised till May 19. This is an irresponsible statement,” said Tiwari. 
 
 The private schools in Indore have once again failed to meet the deadline for RTE recognition as over 100 schools are yet to be recognised for admission under RTE from the city. 
 
 District collector P  , who is the head of the committee for RTE admissions in the district, agreed that the DEO might not be aware about the exact dates. “The DPC is looking at the RTE admissions and thus the DEO might not be updated about the deadline,” said Narahari. 
 
 Owing to the alleged non-cooperation of the private schools with the district education department, the RTE admission process in the district has once again gone for a toss. 
 
 “May 5 is the last date but again many schools are left so we have given notices to them and warned them about the consequences,” said district project coordinator Akshay Singh Rathore.
