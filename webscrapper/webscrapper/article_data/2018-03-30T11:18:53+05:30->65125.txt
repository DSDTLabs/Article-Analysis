The Hindi version of popular daily soap   will now see two  ! One in the role of Pihu, a friendly ghost who causes light mischief and mayhem and Sona, a doppleganger of Pihu, who is an orphan. It will be interesting to see Arshiya, all of six-years-old, to play a double role in the serial. Dialogue delivery of both   and   are distinctly different from one another. Sona is rustic so it was easy for little   to master the diction. Although it's a negative character, Sona is being liked by one and all.
