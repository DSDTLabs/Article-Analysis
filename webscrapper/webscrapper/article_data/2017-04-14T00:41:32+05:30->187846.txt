NEW DELHI: Delhi   chief   and other members of the party met President   on Thursday afternoon and demanded the registration of an   against chief minister   over the findings of the Shunglu Committee. 

 The delegation, while submitting a memorandum, said   had wasted public money for his own personal interest and should be booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. 
 
 “The detailed findings of the Shunglu Committee report finds Kejriwal guilty of misusing public office, and extending pecuniary and valuable benefits to himself, his cabinet colleagues and affiliates of AAP,” Maken said. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Maken and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh held an interactive session at Bhalswa to discuss Congress’s blueprint ahead of the municipal elections. Maken said the BJP-ruled corporations had flouted for 10 years rules that Ramesh had framed for effective solid waste management. 
 
 He also said that Congress doesn’t indulge in blame game unlike BJP and AAP, but focuses on finding solutions to existing problems. He blamed BJP and AAP of being at loggerheads and stalling development. 
 
 Ramesh said he would urge the Congress councillors to take a pledge that they would make Delhi garbage-free.
