GURUGRAM: The much-delayed railway overbridge (RoB) at   on the   is now complete. It is likely to be opened to traffic by month-end.

 The RoB, located at the junction of sectors 100 and 37D at Basai village, will fill a crucial connectivity gap on the 18km-long Dwarka expressway. Once open — it is scheduled to be inaugurated by chief minister   — the bridge will improve connectivity of new sectors coming up in the area.
 
 “Construction of the RoB is complete and it will be inaugurated soon,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding they are trying to find a time slot from the chief minister’s busy schedule for its inauguration.
 
 Of the 1,200m-long RoB, Indian Railways built the 128m stretch passing over the railway track. The ramps on either side were constructed by Huda, at a cost of around Rs 153 crore. “It was an important infrastructure project,” said a Huda official. Huda is going to connect the expressway with roads going to Pataudi, Basai and all nearby sectors within the next few months. “It’s expected to improve connectivity to 25 sectors on either side of the road,” said he. Most of the residential projects in these sectors are either complete or near completion. 
 
 “The Basai RoB is a key milestone towards completion of the 18km-long Dwarka expressway. This will ease connectivity to various residential projects along the e-way, and fill the connectivity gap on the northern peripheral road,” said Pankaj Bansal, director of real estate firm M3M Group.
 
 The only stretches of the Dwarka expressway in Haryana that remain incomplete now are at New Palam Vihar and Kherki Daula village. Huda has allotted alternative plots to New Palam Vihar oustees in March-April, and will take possession of the land after September as per final terms of settlement. Work on the Delhi portion of the expressway has also gained pace. On May 15, NHAI issued a notification for acquisition of land required for construction of the road.
