 has made her TV comeback with "Dhai Kilo Prem" after a decade and the actress says she is glad to have had that break as she got to spend a lot time with her daughter.
 
  "I'm making a comeback after ten years which is happening by default. I hadn't planned on taking a 10 year break from facing the screen. I was however working behind the scenes as my husband and I started a production house in 2006," Manasi told PTI.
  
  "And we were producing a lot of non-fiction shows and movies together. Even though the break happened by default I am glad it happened as I was able to be a full time and hands on mom to my daughter   during her growing years."
  
  
 
  
  Manasi says she may have started working again but Kiara will always be her topmost priority as she and her husband,   cannot compromise when it comes to their daughter.
  
  "Kiara is and has always been our number one priority. I have her calendar marked out, and Rohit and me plan our stuff around it as much as possible.
  
  "Rohit has managed to come to almost all her PTM's so far and every Annual day. Our vacations are planned around her holiday schedule. So, yeah we make sure we are there for her at all times," she says.
  
  When asked if she has found any change in the industry after being absent from it for so many years, she says, "Honestly not much has changed. The set of a daily feels pretty much the same.
  
  "I was really nervous and apprehensive on the first day of my shoot but by the end of the day it felt like home again. And I didn't feel like I was back on television after nearly a decade."
