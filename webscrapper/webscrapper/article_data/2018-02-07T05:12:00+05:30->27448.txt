Mysuru: Around 20   from Nanjangud have volunteered to clean   ahead of ‘Dodda Jathre’ (big fair) of Sri Srikanteshwara Swamy Temple. Lakhs of devotees and tourists participate in the fair which will be held on March 28 this year.

 The youths, all members of  , joined hands with the district administration and temple authorities on Tuesday to help clean the river which is filled with clothes and plastic waste. Temple authorities had contracted an earth mover to scoop up the waste and silt stuck on the bed of the river near the devotees’ bath area. The volunteers helped pile up the waste into trucks which were hired to transport the waste.
 
 Nanjangud Yuva Brigade member ‘Snake’ Basavaraju told TOI: “Devotees and visitors, who number in lakhs each year, dump their cloths in the river after taking a bath. The belief is that their sins or problems are washed in the holy water. After the bath, the devotees wear new cloths and perform puja in the temple. Dumping worn cloths in the river has become a ritual for the devotees. During temple fairs, the number of devotees is more than a lakh on a single day. Now the river is choked with these old clothes.”
 
 Basavaraju said more than 20 trucks of waste has been removed. “We have dumped all the waste at an open place far away from the temple premises. Later, it will be disposed of scientifically,” he said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Kumaraswamy, executive officer of Sri Srikanteshwaraswamy Temple, said: “This clean-up operation is being done on directions from the deputy commissioner. This cleaning will allow water to flow freely and the area near the bathing place will be cleaner.”
