JAIPUR: A mega sterilization camp is being advertised to be held at Hanumangarh on World Population Day, July 11. Activists fear that such camps are being planned in other parts of the state too, although the poster that this reporter found was of Hanumangarh alone, with a schedule for   in four different government facilities.

 In September last year, the   banned sterilization camps and asked the Centre to ensure better access to primary healthcare. The judgment came as public health activist   took the matter to court after 53 women were sterilized in a school – not hospital – in Araria district, Bihar, under unhygienic conditions, risking the lives of those undergoing the procedure. The school did not even have running water.
 
 In November 2014, 15 women lost their lives in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, after being sterilized in a camp. They had earlier been paid to undergo the procedure; the payment was called an “incentive” to make couples desist from having large families.
 
 The posters advertising the mega sterilization camp in Hanumangarh too come with cash incentives – Rs1,400 to each woman, as “encouragement” and Rs2,000 to each man. Even those who refer people for such operations can expect a reward. There is something called a “prerak” reward for a person encouraging a young person who has “finished his family” to undergo the surgery – Rs200 for bringing a woman and Rs300 for bringing a man to undergo the procedure.
 
 The schedule advertised on the poster says the camp on July 11 will be held at the Rawatsar community health centre. Similar operations will be conducted in different government facilities in the district on 10, 21 and 23 July.
 
 This reporter attempted to reach Hanumangarh district collector Parkash Rajpurohit, principal health secretary Veenu Gupta and health minister   for a response to this poster, which flies in the face of the SC ruling. None of them answered the phone on Saturday.
