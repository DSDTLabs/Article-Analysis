Vadodara: A business development manager of prominent BPO company Collabera Services Private Limited was booked for violation of Information Technology Act. Accused Abdul Kader Basrai had allegedly leaked confidential information and data of the company to its competitor through email. Police said Basrai, who had joined the company in February 2013, had been heading his department since April last year. On joining, he had signed a contract with the company to not share any confidential information and data of the company with anyone. Since he had access to his official email address on his mobile phone and private computer, he started mailing confidential information and clients’ data to his personal email address from the official email address, police said. When the company became suspicious about Basrai in January, they launched an internal inquiry during which it came to light that Basrai used to leak confidential data. From his personal email address he used to allegedly mail the information to their competitor Softnice India Private Limited’s employees, the complaint filed by Collabera’s HR manager Abhishek Verma stated. Basrai was given show-cause notice.
