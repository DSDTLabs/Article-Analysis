PUNE: The PMPML top brass has admitted that fixing the dysfunctional automatic doors at the bus shelters along the Ahmednagar Road   corridor is among its top-priority tasks to ensure smooth traffic. 

 On Tuesday, Pune   (PMPML) chairperson and managing director   took a bus ride along the corridor to understand the commuters’ problems and resolve those by April 30. The immediate challenge facing the transport utility she spotted was the private vehicles straying into the lanes exclusively meant for buses.
 
 A PMPML officer said the utility does not have the authority to confiscate such vehicles. He said, “We will talk to the Pune traffic police officers, including deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ashok Morale, to stop the vehicles from entering the bus rapid transit system (BRTS) lanes.” 
 
 The officer said a committee comprising PMPML officials, two civic body engineers and members of NGOs carried out an inspection of the   BRTS route. 
 
 Among the defects identified along the BRTS corridor was the defects in the doors at the stops. “The doors are either always open and don’t close, or vice versa. The doors should open as soon as a bus stops. The   needs to fix it by April 30,” the officer said. 
 
 Gunde’s predecessor,  , had announced consfiscation and auction of the vehicles entering the BRTS lanes. He had also ordered a drive to catch the vehicles entering the lanes dedicated to the buses. The drive, which started from December mid last year, continued till January this year and owners of over 150 private vehicles straying into the bus lane were penalized. 
 
 “The traffic wardens guarding the BRTS corridors do not have any powers to take action against the offender and we are trying to reverse the situation. A drive to stop the private vehicles from entering the corridors will be started and the traffic police will take stern actions against them,” an officer said.
