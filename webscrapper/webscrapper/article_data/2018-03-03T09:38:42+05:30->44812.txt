TRICHY:   in   are all set to go hi-tech with the establishment of a common facility for jewellery making at a cost of Rs 360 lakh.   collector   on Friday issued a statement that the state and central governments have given their nod and will provide a grant of Rs 325 lakhs to set up the centre.

 To be launched under the cluster development program, the centre will become functional at a three-storey building in Devadhanam in Trichy city soon. The objective is to facilitate goldsmiths with machineries and empower them to compete with their counterparts in other cities, who switched to modern technologies, to make gold jewelleries faster and at competitive making charge for jewellery shops.
 
 Aimed at helping the ailing 2,000 goldsmiths who are adept at manually crafting gold jewelleries in Trichy, a group of 25 goldsmiths had formed a cluster in 2009 and applied for the financial sanction from the government, which finally gave its green signal to them.
 
 A special purpose vehicle (SPV) committee has also been formed by the goldsmiths. While the SPV took the building in   for lease, the goldsmiths contributed 10 % of the total project cost. The common facility centre will be equipped with lab, moulding centre, magnetic polishing unit, electrical polishing unit, automatic wax moulding and few others machinery.
 
 When the goldsmiths had embarked the move in 2009, there were 8,000 goldsmiths in Trichy. Now, the number came down to 2,000 as many left the business following the onslaught of jewelleries made by machines.
 
 “It is not affordable for goldsmiths to take orders for lesser making charges. The situation will turn favourable when machines available at our centre and then we can also compete with them,” said managing director of   on Friday.
 
 Being the nodal agency for implementation of cluster development program, Tamil Nadu small industries development corporation (SIDCO) will act as a bridge between the government and the common facility centre.
