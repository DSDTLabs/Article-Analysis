Margao: Tribal welfare minister Govind Gaude, on Saturday, assured that he would strive to increase the funds sanctioned by the Goa BJP coalition-led government in its budget for the welfare of the downtrodden tribal communities in Goa. He also said that he would try and simplify the lengthy procedure of availing schemes meant for the scheduled tribes (STs).

 Gaude made this remark while speaking as the chief guest at a function organized by the Tribal Multipurpose Cooperative Credit Society (TMCCS) at the Matanhy Saldanha administrative complex, Margao, on Saturday. The minister distributed cheques totaling Rs 1.78 crores to 16 beneficiaries under the Tribal Generation Programme, a scheme of the directorate of industries, trade and commerce.
 
 Gaude also announced plans of increasing the maximum limit of government-sanctioned loans from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1crore, so as to encourage more tribal entrepreneurs to be self-employed.
 
 Gaude informed STOI that “previously, there was no proper utilization of the government-sanctioned funds, hence, the budgetary provision decreased from Rs 7crore in 2011 to Rs 3crore in 2017. Also, files were pending with the previous government. I will now request the government to increase the funds and this issue will be resolved during the forthcoming monsoon assembly session.”
