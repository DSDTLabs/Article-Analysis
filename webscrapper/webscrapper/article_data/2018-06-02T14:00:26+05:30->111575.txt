PATNA: Police failed to make any breakthrough in the murder of   district welfare officer (DWO)   (57). Dutt was shot dead by three bike-borne assailants near his rented accommodation in Kailash Puri Colony under the Dumra police station area in Sitamarhi on Thursday. 

 Sadar SDPO Kumar Vir Dhirendra said it was yet not clear why he was murdered. His call details records (CDR) were being analysed. Dumra SHO   said four empty cartridges of 7.65mm and two pellets were recovered from the spot. Dutt’s son   (22) has lodged an FIR against unknown persons. 
 
 Dutt’s family resides at   under the Digha police station area in Patna. He hailed from Madhubani district. He was from Bihar Welfare Service cadre and had joined service in October 1989. 
 
 One of Dutt’s colleague told   that he was unwilling to join field duty. “He had shared his feelings that he would be happy if the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe welfare department gives him any less important position and allows him to remain posted in Patna,” he said.
