LUCKNOW: A 10-second conversation during which PM   lent an ear to SP patriarch   to whisper in while he nodded in affirmation has everyone wondering what was said. 

 Like seasoned politicians, Mulayam and his son, former UP CM  , attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new UP CM and his cabinet and were accorded a warm welcome. 
 
 But the last-minute interaction, when the SP leader walked up to the PM, held his hand and waved with the other while the crowd chanted “Modi! Modi!”, and then whispered in his ear, had the crowd guessing. 
 
 While the two exchanged pleasantries,   chief  , standing nearby, called Akhilesh who walked up to them and shook hands with Modi after joining his hands in a “namaste”. The four of them talked and laughed before Modi moved on to meet other dignitaries on the stage. 
 
 All through the event Mulayam appeared more relaxed than Akhilesh. Mulayam has often described Modi as a self-made man who has risen from the ranks. Modi, in turn, has lauded him as a seasoned politician.
