 Kerry Katona said she finds it hard to raise five children.

 "Being a mum is everything to me. First and foremost, it's my purpose in life. It's the best thing but don't get me wrong -- there are times when I want to sit in the bathroom and cry, it's hard.
 
  
  
 "I am doing it all on my own -- and I've had some terrible relationships -- but at the end of the day, I've got my kids to show for it and they are what I'm most proud of. Every single day I can look at them and know that I've brought them up myself - and I'm incredibly proud of that."
 
 The 37-year-old star split from   in 2014. Though she had known their marriage was over for some time, she still spent a long time "grieving" for their relationship in the months afterwards.
 
 She said: "In the last few months, I knew that our relationship was over. At one time I was blinded because George was just so handsome, but his ugliness on the inside came through in the end. When we did split, it was horrible. It was like a death because we'd previously been together 24/7." 
 
 "Once I'd kicked him out, it was grieving process, but I knew it was right. Now I finally realise that I can live without him and I'm excited for the future."
