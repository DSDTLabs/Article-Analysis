CHANDIGARH: The   government has started the process of charge-sheeting a 2014 batch   (PCS) officer for being on leave for the past 15 months.   had gone to the US in October 2016 and has not returned to work since then.

 A senior official told the TOI that Kaur was given an extension till December 18 last year but neither has she joined back after that nor has she informed the government about her future plans. The file to issue her a charge sheet has already been moved. Kaur joined the PCS on June 26, 2014.
 
 
 
 
 She was posted as Moga sub-divisional magistrate on July 13, 2014, and was later handed over additional charge of commissioner of Moga municipal corporation in June 2015. Barely two years into the job, she had she gone on ex-India leave which ended on June 2017. She moved an application for extension till December but the state government rejected it.
 
 TOI had reported in the October 25, 2017 edition that the PCS officer had chosen to approach the state government for extension of leave through the Congress party’s MLA from Moga, Dr Harjot Kamal Singh after which she got the extension. The Moga MLA had stated that since Kaur was an honest officer, he had recommended her case to the chief minister. The MLA had told TOI that as far as he knew, the officer’s husband was settled in the US.
 
 The Punjab government had formulated a policy for officials’ ex-India leave on June 24, 2016. There were no guidelines until then. The policy says once the officer or employee goes on ex-India leave, he cannot apply for extension, except on medical grounds or under unavoidable circumstances.
 
 The policy makes it clear that if the officer or employee fails to join back within 15 days of the leave ending, he would be issued show cause notice and that action would be taken according to PCS (punishment and appeal) rules, 1970.
