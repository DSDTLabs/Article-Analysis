BATHINDA: Taking serious note of the spate of farm suicides and to remind   chief minister Amarinder Singh of his promise of complete farm loan waiver, Aam Aadmi Party’s ‘kisan sangharsh committee’ (farmer struggle committee) would directly coordinate with farmers from the Independence Day.

 The party will undertake padyatras (marches) in all the districts of Punjab from September 2 to 6. The newly-elected coordinator of the farm struggle committee and Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said a panel had been formed to pressurize the Union and the state governments to fulfil their promises. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sandhwan said, “AAP may also approach the court against the Congress government for not fulfilling its promises as per the election manifesto on loan waiver and other facilities to farmers.” He said due to the lethargic attitude of the Union and state governments towards farmers, suicides had become a common feature in Punjab, known as the food bowl of India.
 
 He said more than 100 farmers have ended their lives due to debt and other reasons in the last four months since the Congress formed the government in Punjab. “This government is working like the previous SAD-BJP regime.” 
 
 Earlier in the day, Sandhwan was made the coordinator of the committee and Ahbaab Singh Grewal was chosen as the general secretary. MLA Jai Krishan Rori, Daljit Singh Sadarpura, Kanwalpreet Singh and Gurwinder Singh Shampura have been included as members.
