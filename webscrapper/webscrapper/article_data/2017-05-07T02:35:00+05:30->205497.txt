NAGPUR: Drivers of app-based cab aggregator Uber continued their strike for the second day on Saturday and affected those who depend on this mode of transport.

 Many commuters were stranded as their mobile applications did not display Uber cabs for hiring. “I am a regular cab user and haven’t been able to get a single cab in the last two days. Autorickshaws in Nagpur charge exorbitant fares even for small distances,” said  , a resident of Ram Nagar and who commutes to IT Park for work.
 
 Hundreds of taxi drivers contracted with Uber went on strike on Friday at   protesting against the new schemes of Rs59 per five km, Rs88 for 7km and Rs99 for 8km introduced by the company. This, according to the drivers, had reduced their incentives. 
 
 “Under the new offer, we were getting incentives between Rs10 and Rs30 per trip only,” they said. 
 
 The drivers who have joined the strike have temporarily removed the device from their vehicles and returned it to Uber.
 
 A few striking drivers pointed out that already they were facing problems as autos do not allow them entry into the railway station and any mall in the city. “Auto drivers damage our vehicles if we do so,” said Akash Rangari, a driver. 
 
 Passengers at the airport and station were the hardest hit. “I tried booking for 20 minutes and later took a private cab from the airport,” said Rohit Verma who landed in the city on Saturday morning.
 
 IT professional   said he had grown accustomed to the cabs as they were comfortable and affordable. “The government must think of an alternative to provide better transport,” he said.
 
 A delegation of Uber partners also met district guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule to raise their issues. Bawankule has convened a meeting on May 9. Uber officials in Mumbai stated they will issue a statement next week.
