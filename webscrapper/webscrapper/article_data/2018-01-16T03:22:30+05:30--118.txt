MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Monday asked the state government to inform it of the progress in framing a   for emergency   transplants. A division bench of Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Nitin Sambre gave the state two weeks to file its affidavit. “The question is how to balance regulations with   retrieval of organs,” it observed.

 Government pleader Poornima Kantharia said the state was considering the framing of guidelines. The court was hearing a petition filed in August by Dadar resident Swapnil Rawat — he is on the waiting list for a kidney   — seeking organ and tissue retrieval from a 71-year-old brain dead man admitted to a hospital in Powai. The man died before the permissions could be in place.
