MADURAI: Regional transport offices (RTOs) in Madurai have been witnessing a big influx of women for the past one week thanks to the state government’s announcement of two-wheelers at subsidised prices to them. A lot of women thronged the RTOs on Saturday, the last day for submitting applications for the scheme.

 Usually, about ten per cent of the Learner Licence Registration (LLR) applicants in the RTOs are females, while 90 per cent are male. But, this has been reversed in the past two weeks because of the Amma two-wheeler scheme. Under the scheme to be launched on former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary on February 24, eligible women would get Rs 25,000 or 50 per cent of the moped cost.
 
 Beneficiaries should be in the age group of 18 to 40 years with annual family income less than Rs 2.50 lakh. The scheme also envisages preference for widows, disabled women and transgenders. With the deadline for applying fixed as February 10, the crowds were much bigger on Saturday with every applicant hoping to be able to pay the fee on time and attend the LLR classes. Pushpalatha M of S Alangulam said that she had applied for leave and come to obtain an LLR which would enable their family to possess a vehicle of its own. ``I know to drive and I have practised on the vehicles of my relatives, but since an LLR is necessary for the bike scheme, I thought of applying,’’ she said.
 
 Driving inspector A S Senthilram said that the constitution of the LLR classes had changed to 90 per cent females and much lesser men in the last two weeks. ``Females are showing a lot of interest in getting LLRs now,’’ he said. While giving LLRs, the driving inspectors chat with the candidates to ascertain their hearing ability, ask them to sign to see if their fingers are intact.
