KOZHIKODE:   conferred honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) on actor   and athlete P T Usha at a special convocation ceremony held at the varsity on Monday.

 Governor and chancellor of state universities, P  , who presented the degrees, said that the rise of Mohanlal opened a new era in   cinema. "His role as a social ambassador swayed popular opinion in favour of organ donation,” he added.
 
 Sathasivam recalled that Usha rose to national attention at a time when India's athletic scene was marked by pessimism and doubts about the country's future in sports.
 
 In his acceptance speech, Mohanlal said that he considered the honour a recognition for cinema industry. "Cinema is an art form, a result of dedication of a number of people. All my success belongs to those who have contributed in my pursuit of art, ranging from writers and directors to makeup artists, lighting crew, etc,” he added.
 
 Usha, an alumna of Calicut University, said that she was proud of having achieved everything that she hoped for in her career, except the Olympic medal which she missed by a whisker 35 years ago. 
 
 "I firmly believe that the country will be able to achieve the Olympic medal in 2020 in Tokyo or in Paris Olympics in 2024 if we work unitedly," she added.
 
 Education minister  , varsity vice-chancellor  , among others attended the function.
