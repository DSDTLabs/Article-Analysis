 and   have worked together in numerous films and have several memories from these movies. Recently, while shooting for ' ', the actors went down memory lane.

 A scene from director Umesh Shuklaâ€™s film required some music to be played on a gramophone and the songs of ' ' (1959) were chosen. The actors shot for the scene while the songs of the film played in the backdrop. Both Amitabh and Rishi started enjoying the songs so much that they let the gramophone play on not just for the duration of scenes, but till the whole album ended. The actors decided to sit back with their feet up and enjoy the evening just singing and listening to the good old songs. Soon, the entire crew joined in and a regular shoot day turned into a fun musical evening.
