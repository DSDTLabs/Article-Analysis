MUMBAI: A 20-year-old college student was arrested for showing his middle finger and hurling an expletive at a woman who confronted him for trying to run over a stray dog at   recently. The woman shot a video and uploaded it on WhatsApp, after which an animal welfare group persuaded her to press charges. The youth was subsequently released on bail. 

 Ruku  , a digital strategist with a magazine and an animal lover, said she frequently fed strays outside   mall. She noticed a youth coming over on a two-wheeler around 6.30pm on February 15. 
 
 "He was in a hurry and narrowly missed hitting one of the dogs. The guards of the building where he lives saw it too," said Taneja. When the stray barked at him, he tried to run over it with his vehicle two-three times. "Fortunately, the stray was not hurt. He started laughing. I questioned him and told him he could have run over me instead," said Taneja. The youth was dismissive and entered his society to park his motorcycle. Taneja followed him and started shooting a video on her cell phone. He told her to move away when she repeatedly asked him why he had tried to run over the strays. When Taneja said the building was not his property and she could stand where she wanted, he replied that he owned a flat there. He showed her the middle finger, hurled an expletive and left. 
 
 The youth was booked under section 509 of IPC.
