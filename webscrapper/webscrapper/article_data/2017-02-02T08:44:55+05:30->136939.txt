LUCKNOW: Flyers may be in for better services with Union government making budgetary provision for operation and maintenance of airports in tier-II cities on a   (public private participation) model. 

 Aviation experts said the provision actually replaces the privatisation scheme proposed earlier that could not take off on account of low profitability of relatively smaller airports. In UP, for example, Lucknow and Varanasi airports were proposed to be thrown open for privatisation in 2013. The government, however, stepped back and cancelled the mandatory   (RFQ) after not many private players reached out.
 
 The PPP model, however, may evince interest amongst private parties that may get involved in only a section of airport operation/maintenance while not having to bear the burden of the whole setup. A senior AAI official said how the model is executed will have to be worked out in terms of profitability.
 
 Delhi and Mumbai airports are fully privatised, while no airport, except for Cochin is being operated on PPP model. Centre had first hinted at developing airports in tier-II cities on PPP model in 2015 when former minister of state for civil aviation Mahesh Sharma, in a written reply in  , said government plans to take up development and modernisation of the airports at Ahmedabad and Jaipur through the PPP model. 
 
 The government, however, did not consequently issue the RFQ. According to AAI, it manages 125 airports in the country, out of which 11 airports are in profit, including the Ahmedabad and Jaipur airports.
 
 Lucknow airport, especially, shows significant potential of getting developed on PPP model, said aviation experts. The airport has seen gradual increase in number of flyers, with many international airlines lining up to connect the state capital with international destinations. AAI is planning airport expansion over an area of around 174 acres in the days to come.
