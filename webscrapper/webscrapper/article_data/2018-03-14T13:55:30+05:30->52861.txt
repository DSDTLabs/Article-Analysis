COIMBATORE: The state government has sanctioned Rs 320 crore to acquire 355.5 acres in 16 villages in the district to construct the 32.43km Western Ring Road. The four-lane road would enable motorists from south-west Coimbatore to reach the northern part without entering the city. Also, tourists from Kerala on the way to Ooty and Mettupalayam will have a hassle-free journey once the road is completed.

 The ring road would start from Sugunapuram near   on Coimbatore-Palakkad Road and would reach Narasimmanaickenpalayam through Sundakkamuthur, Perur, Theethipalayam, Madampatti, Pannimadai, Gudalur and Narasimmanaickenpalayam. To implement the project, the state government is planning to acquire 355.6 acres at Kuniyamuthur, Madukkarai, Sundakkamuthur, Perur, Perur Chettipalayam, Vadavalli, Narasimmanaickenpalayam, Gudalur, Pannimadai, Nanjundapuram, Chithiraichavadi West, Kalikkanaickenpalayam, Madampatti, Theethipalayam, Kavundampalayam and Somayampalayam. These 16 villages fall under Madukkarai, Perur and   taluks.
 
 The state government had allotted Rs 825 crore for the road project last year. Two units, consisting of special tahsildars Raja and Muruganandam, and land surveyors had started survey a month ago. The revenue department will soon issue notification to the land owners to acquire the needed land for the project soon, sources said.
 
 Collector TN Hariharan conducted a meeting with the revenue department officials and state highways department officials at his camp office at Race Course on Tuesday evening and instructed them to expedite land acquisition.
