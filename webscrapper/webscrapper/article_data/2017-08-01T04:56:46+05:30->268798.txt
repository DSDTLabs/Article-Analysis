GURUGRAM: Authorities of the branch of   in Garhi Harsaru, from where 14 (not 20 as reported earlier) children — nine girls and five boys — were picked up by cops on July 7, claimed they have not received any information about the whereabouts of the kids from either cops or the   (CWC). The only information they said they have received is from media reports that they have been placed in other   in the city.

 “There is no official word from either police or CWC on the whereabouts of the 14 children who were taken away by cops on the evening of July 7. Under normal circumstances, we would be informed where a child is being taken, and given the necessary documents, such as ‘restoration papers’. That has not happened so far,” said an official, requesting anonymity.
 
 “They also confiscated official records of these children and a laptop. The cops have come couple of times looking for records of the 14 children, but how are we to produce these when CWC has taken them away? We’ve no idea where they have been kept and how they are. The only news we’ve received is from a vernacular newspaper, that they have been placed in other shelter homes in the city. We hope they are safe,” the official said.
 
 Talking to TOI, CWC chairperson Shakuntala Dhull said she is not obliged to inform Ujjwal Niketan about the kids’ whereabouts.“We’re not obliged to send them any documents or inform them where they are. It’s the government’s responsibility of ensuring the children are safe,” she said.
