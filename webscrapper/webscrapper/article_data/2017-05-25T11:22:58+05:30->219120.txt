SECUNDERABAD: Before the chief minister announced that the   would not come up at Parade Ground, nearly 250 walkers, including   members, participated in a protest to 'Save Parade Ground'. Walkers wore wristbands with a message to save the grounds on their wrists as part of their rally. 

 Another senior Congress leader and former vice-chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)   also participated in the protest. He arrived at the Parade Ground at around 6.30am and was there for about an hour. He interacted with walkers and sportspersons and elicited their views about the Telangana government's proposal to construct a Secretariat. On Tuesday, V   extended his support to the campaign.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Shashidhar Reddy described the K Chandrasekhar Rao government's move to construct a new Secretariat on the Parade Ground as 'Tughluq' idea. He recalled the CM's earlier idea to build a new Secretariat on the premises of Chest Hospital, Erragadda, before shelving it. "Parade Ground is meant for Army operations and hundreds of budding cricketers to practice and the Congress will not allow the government to take over this precious piece of land for a new Secretariat," he said.
 
 "This is the only lung space available in Secunderabad and more than 50 members of Laughter Club come to Parade Ground. We oppose the proposal of construction of Secretariat," said Ch Lakshminarayana, a senior member of the club.
 
 Later in the day on Wednesday, the chief minister clarified to the media here that the government was seeking the Bison Polo Ground or Gymkhana Ground for a new Secretariat and not the Parade Ground at all.
