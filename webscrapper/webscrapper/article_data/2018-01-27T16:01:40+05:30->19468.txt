 NEW DELHI: England's in-form   and India's   came out on top of the first set of capped allrounders during day one of the 2018 IPL auction in Bengaluru, going for hefty pay checks, while arguably the steal deal of the day came in the form of New Zealand allrounder   going to   for Rs 1.9 crore from a base price of 50 lakh. 
 
 
 
 
 From a base price of Rs 2 crore, Jadhav zoomed to his most profitable IPL pay day, landing with Chennai Super Kings for Rs 7.8 crore. Though no spring chicken at 32, Jadhav offers Chennai a handy batsman-wicketkeeper-spinning option, one capable of batting through the batting order and finishing chases. CSK also spent on Jadhav's former   Bangalore team-mate  , the third-highest run-getter in the ongoing Big Bash League, for Rs 4 crore after seeing interest from Daredevils. 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 Woakes was another highly valued allrounder, purchased by Royal Challengers Bangalore for Rs 7.4 crore. The Hyderabad franchise added allrounders in Carlos Brathwaite for 2 crore and   for 1.9 crore. Australia's Marcus Stoinis went back to Kings XI Punjab with one of their Right-to-Match (RTM) cards, having been valued at Rs 6.20 crore. 
 
 
 
 In Munro, ranked No 1 in T20Is, Daredevils have acquired a superb T20 package. Already this year, the left-hand batsman has smacked 66 off 23 balls, 104 off 53 balls - the first to score three hundreds in the format - and 49* off 43 balls. This, after he scored two T20I centuries for New Zealand last year. 
 
  picked one allrounder in Stuart Binny for his base price of 50 lakh.
 
 The only allrounder to go unsold was Australian James Faulkner, whose base price of Rs 2 crore and lack of eye-catching form may have been factors.
