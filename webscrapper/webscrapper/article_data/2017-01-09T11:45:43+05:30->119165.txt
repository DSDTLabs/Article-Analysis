PATNA:   (BJP) president   will release a 15-volume ‘complete works’ of party’s founder president   at Shri Krishna Memorial Hall here on Tuesday.

 The BJP has given a publicity binge to the event as large size billboards informing people about Shah’s visit have been put up at nodal points, including in front of the party’s state headquarters and income-tax roundabout. 
 
 State BJP chief   said Shah, who will arrive here at 10am, would first go to Takhat Harmandir Saheb in Patna City to pay obeisance to tenth Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. He will then visit the state BJP headquarters and finally release Upadhyaya’s works at SKM Hall at 2pm.
 
 Rai said the function has been organised under the aegis of Ekatm Manavdarshan Anusandhan Evam Vikas Pratishthan and ‘Chiti’ which is the unit of ‘Pragya Pravah.’ He said all Union ministers from the state, along with prominent leaders of the party, would be present on the occasion.
 
 Incidentally, after the national council meet of the BJP at Kozhikode (Kerala) in August last year, Bihar BJP’s former president Mangal Pandey had announced that the party’s state unit would establish a research institute where training of the party workers would also be organised. The complete works of Upadhyaya would definitely be a part of the institute’s library, he added.
 
 Stressing on the importance and significance of the function being held at SKM Hall, Rai said Upadhyaya’s birth centenary celebration is the party’s national programme. Besides, both the party and the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre has decided to celebrate 2017 as ‘Garib Kalyan Varsh,’ and the benefits of development should reach ‘the last man’, he said, adding that various programmes are being organised at polling booths. The state has around 56,000 polling booths.
