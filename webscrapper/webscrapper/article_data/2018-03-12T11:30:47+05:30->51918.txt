HYDERABAD: Last Tuesday, one person died and four were injured after they were hit by a Honda City car near in Shamirpet. These people had gathered at an accident spot, when the over-speeding Honda City hit them.

 This accident was the latest in a string of such road mishaps to have taken place due to reckless and dangerous driving.
 
  
 Data available with the   show that dangerous, zig-zag and rash and negligent driving are rampant across the city. What’s more worrying is that the number of violations has not dipped significantly over the past three years.
 
 An analysis conducted by traffic cops on accident-related deaths showed that in most cases of fatal road accidents, rash and negligent driving were the chief reasons behind the mishap.
 
 Road safety experts call for stricter punishment and massive awareness campaigns to curb such reckless and negligent driving practices within city limits.
 
 “Just fining violators is not enough to deter people from indulging in reckless driving. It’s the top cause of accidents within city limits. Outside city limits over speeding is among the major causes. Hefty fines and stricter punishments must be imposed. In addition, massive awareness campaigns on safe driving practices must be taken up across the city,” said Vinod Kamula, CEO of   Safety.
 
 In 2017, 3,200 cases of zigzag and reckless driving and more than 20,500 cases of dangerous driving were booked by cops. In the past three years, traffic cops have booked more than 7,300 cases of zig-zag and reckless driving and 96,445 cases of dangerous driving. While no significant increase was observed in the number of cases booked between 2015 and 2016, the number of those indulging in zigzag and reckless driving has grown by 55% in 2017, compared with 2016.
