I also feel that the new implementation of   will benefit the industry in the long run.But it is true that the current situation is bad, because of which the smaller films have had to face the music. There has been a lukewarm response among moviegoers. There are talks doing the rounds about flexible ticket pricing.Let's see what's in store for us and the audience,“ he says. 

 Talking about his yet-to-be-titled film, Udhayanidhi says that he couldn't be happier as the project has veteran   wielding the megaphone. “I saw the film last year, and felt it was a little slow and was sceptical about its reception here, if made in Tamil.But when Priyan sir asked if I could do the protagonist's role in the remake, I agreed without a second thought. Our version will have a few changes to meet the nativity requirements,“ he smiles.
