Amritsar: A photograph of the Golden Temple printed on an Australia-made ‘Amritsari Fish’ pack has invited wrath of the head of the Sikhs’ supreme temporal body, Akal Takht. 

 Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh has demanded “immediate withdrawal” of the packing of ‘Amritsari Fish’ made by Australia-based Curry Masters and sought an unconditional apology from the makers for hurting religious sentiments of the community.
 
 His statement came after a photograph of the packing, presumably clicked by a Sikh buyer using a mobile phone at a shopping mall in Australia, had gone viral on social media and caught the jathedar’s attention. “It is not acceptable. I have appealed to the Sikh sangat (community) of Australia to approach the manufacturer and ensure that not only the controversial packing is withdrawn from the market, but no such packing is used in future,” said Gurbachan. 
 
 He said Sikhs living across the globe should raise awareness about their religious practices and beliefs. 
 
 Earlier, there was a storm in religious and political circles after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) printed a photograph of its symbol, the broom, along with photograph of the Golden Temple on its election manifesto cover. After objections, AAP not only tendered an unconditional apology, but also removed the controversial cover of their manifesto.
 
 However, a visit to Curry Master’s website shows a packing of Amritsari Fish without picture of Golden Temple. Partap Singh, a Delhi resident currently on tour of Australia, told TOI from Sydney, “This is the new packing of ‘Amritsari Fish’ with picture of Golden Temple.” He said there was much resentment among the local Sikh community for printing the gurdwara picture with fish for commercial purpose.
