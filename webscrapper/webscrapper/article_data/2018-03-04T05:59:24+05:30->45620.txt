PATNA: School of Historical Studies at   (NU) will organize a three-day binational workshop at Rajgir International Convention Centre from Sunday.

 NU vice-chancellor Sunaina Singh said the workshop has been designed with a cross-disciplinary focus, which will benefit students and faculty across all schools of the international university.
 
 “The workshop is aimed at stimulating a discussion and understanding of the categories of culture, tradition, memory, ritual, body, space and time in their theoretical and practical considerations. It will also facilitate further research undertaken by students by exposing them to highly recognized practitioners, performers and theoreticians of traditional and modern art forms,” Singh said.
 
 Different sessions in the workshop will include an inaugural lecture-performance session on Mudiyettu (folk dance drama from Kerala) with a troupe from Natyavedi Kerala, headed by Dr C K Thomas and consisting of Aadarsh Chunkath and Meena Paul. Mudiyettu entails a ritualistic performance of the Kali-Darika myth within the space of a temple.
 
 On the second day, Ruhanie Perera, a lecturer of English department of  , Sri Lanka will discuss about the socio-cultural dynamics of place, context, and narrative with respect to a work of performance. The second day will conclude with a performance by Perera on ‘Somewhere between truth and its telling.’
 
 The final session on the third day is designed as a ‘conversation’ that encourages a variety of responses from participants of the workshop. The session will be chaired by dean of the   Malik.
