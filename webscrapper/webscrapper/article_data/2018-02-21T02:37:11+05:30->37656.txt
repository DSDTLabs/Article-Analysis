GORAKHPUR:  , member of the   and former BJP MP, said on Tuesday that senior lawyers and Congress leaders   and   had been bought over by terrorists, hence they were creating hurdles in regular hearing of the   case in the Supreme Court.

 
 Vedanti was in Gorakhpur on Tuesday to attend a private programme.
 
 Vedanti accused Sibal and Chidambaram of deliberately delaying the hearing and influencing judges by raising issues like the timing of the judgment. Vedanti said the two leaders were on the payrolls of Pakistani terrorists and were doing so at the instance of Sonia Gandhi.
 
 "Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram are on the payrolls of terrorists and they are trying to delay the Ayodhya case as they don't want this issue to be settled. Sonia Gandhi does not want that the decision in this case comes and they are trying to do this with money," said Vedanti.
 
 Vedanti said that PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath as well as the people of the country wanted the construction of Ram temple. "Both PM Modi and CM Yogi want the construction of Ram temple. So do the people of India. The court verdict on Ram temple is getting delayed. Kapil Sibal had requested the court to postpone the decision till 2019," he said.
