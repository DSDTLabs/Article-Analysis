PANAJI: The question of the   and Hospital ( ) running out of medicines will not arise with the new 24x7 in-house  , health Minister   said after inaugurating it on Wednesday.

 “Why should people go out to buy medicines? They should all be made available at the GMC itself,” he said. 
 
 The state-of-the-art pharmacy has counters that can cater to up to 15 people at a time and will be stocked with all kinds of medicines, including surgical implants. 
 
 “Earlier patients would complain that some medicines were not available at the hospital and would get desperate. Since treatment was completely free in the hospital, they wouldn’t carry much money, thus adding to their burden,”   said.
 
 GMC medical superintendent Dr  , said the new pharmacy has a wide range of medicines and will help reduce the serpentine queues of patients. “Earlier, we had a pharmacy with a very small counter. Now, we have changed the design of the pharmacy and have put in 15 sale counters,” he said.
