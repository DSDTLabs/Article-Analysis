 is known for speaking his mind not just on camera, but also off it on social media. The ace filmmaker has spoken up about the Tollywood   and the ‘interrogation’   and actor   faced. 

 Puri Jagannadh and Subbaraju’s names are two amongst the twelve names being looked into by the SIT in connection to the drugs making rounds in Hyderabad. Puri Jagannadh was present before the SIT on July 20 and he was questioned for 10 hours. On July 21, it was Subbaraju’s turn and the actor was questioned for hours too.
 
 Speaking about the same,   posted to his social media, “I am very much wondering if the school children taking drugs also will be summoned by SIT and interrogated for 12 hours like they are doing to Poori jagan and Subba Raju ..just asking?
 
 Ofcourse everyone kind of know it exists but first time everyone actually heard about this department only because they are using the film industry as a teaser trailer for people to come to know their existence.
 
 Whatever the actual truth of the drugs matter the law in its own course might tell or not tell but for the moment Akun Sabharwal is being projected like Amarendta Bahubali by the Media ..Maybe S S Rajamouli should make Bahubali 3 with him.”
 
 A few hours after the first post received flak for the comments on the Excise Department, he went on to add, “Nobody is denying the integrity of Mr.Sabarwal or his department but even without any charges or conclusive proof to allow the media leaks to destroy the reputations of people apart from causing distress to their families is highly deplorable.”
