JHANSI: For over a decade, private water contractors have been fleecing the residents of   of  , which ironically is the constituency of Union water resources minister  . 

  For drinking water, over 15,000 residents here rely on water tankers and even pipeline connections, at an additional Rs 1,000 per month, provided by the contractors. There is hardly any house in Gumnavara where two to three bore wells have not been dug up, but to no avail. After several polls and as many promises, the people of the area have now decided to take the matter into their hands. 
 
  Most residents have decided to boycott the polls here, scheduled to be held on February 23, and have not allowed candidates to enter the area for canvassing. Several posters and wall graffiti have also come up, asking poll aspirants to stay away. One of them read: "Jal hi jeevan hai, paani nahi to vote nahi (water is life, no water no vote). 
 
  "We have been fighting for our water rights for the past 15 years, but our demands fell on deaf ears. It is the first step of our agitation. If nothing happens after this boycott, we will sit on an indefinite hunger strike," said Chiranaji Lal Tiwari, president of Mahanagar Jal Sangharsh Samiti. Tiwari claimed that Bharti too had promised to address the water problem here on several occasions.
