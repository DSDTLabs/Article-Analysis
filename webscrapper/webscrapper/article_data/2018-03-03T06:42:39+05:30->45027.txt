The FIR was registered on Thursday evening and police have started hunt for the two politicians. "There was intensified vehicle check and police teams were deployed at the residences of the two. But both remained untraceable with their phones switched off," sources said. 
 
 The two sacked MLAs released documents which they said pointed at irregularities in awarding of contracts for road work to companies run by chief minister  's relatives including his son. On Thursday, speaking to the media, Vetrivel and Tamil Selvan said the government had lost about 1,500 crores due to the awarding of the tenders which had only single bidders despite the huge value of the projects.
