KOLKATA: The   (NGT), Eastern Zone Bench, on Tuesday directed the West Bengal cabinet to reconsider its decision on the introduction of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Coal Bed Methane ( ) in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA).

 In a meeting held on February 28, the cabinet had decided that a joint venture company, set up by GAIL India Ltd and Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Company Ltd (GCGSCL), would only be allowed to supply CNG or CBM in the   (KMC) area. GAIL, which will have a 76% stake in the joint venture company, had objected to this on the grounds of viability.
 
 “The bench observed that there should be no more delay as a lot of time had already been lost. The cabinet should approve the project within three weeks and file the compliance report to a closed envelope to the NGT. The bench will open and hear the matter after the panchayat elections. The bench held that going by   orders, if there is any delay in the process of abatement of air pollution, penalty should be imposed on the incumbent responsible for such delay,” environment activist  , the applicant, said.
