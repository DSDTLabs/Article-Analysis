AHMEDABAD: A Gujarati girl from Moti Kukavav village in   district, was diagnosed and operated on for the rare ‘Jodhpur disease’. The two-and-a-half-year-old girl had been throwing up everything she ate for more than two and a half months. 

 Mitva  , was operated on for Jodhpur disease. Her parents are construction labourers and were overwhelmed to see their daughter ingest a meal and not vomit out her food.
 
  “This is a rare disease, with an incidence of 1 in 1 lakh live births. Only 14 cases have been reported in India, the first was in Jodhpur due to which the condition got its name,” said pediatric surgeon Dr Anirudh Shah, who said that the exact cause of the disease is unknown, though there are many hypotheses.
 
 Doctors reported that Mitva was ill for two and half months and would throw up continuously. “She suffered continuous vomiting, acute abdomen pains and a bloated stomach. She lost weight and last weighed only 7kg. 
 
 A detailed diagnosis revealed that she had this rare illness. CT scans and sonography only showed a massively bloated stomach with very slow gastric emptying,” said Dr Shah.
 
 As her parents could not afford treatment at private hospital, Dr Shah raised funds for the girl’s treatment from an old patients who lives in the UAE.
