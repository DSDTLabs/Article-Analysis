MUMBAI: Commuters' valuables worth Rs 2.21 crore were stolen on Western Railway trains and platforms in the first five months of this year. 905 cases of theft were recorded; mobilephones being the most stolen commodity. Besides theft, commuters lost another Rs 1.06 lakh to instances of drugging by conmen. 

 According to the police, maximum mobilephone thefts occur at Andheri, Borivali and the Vasai-Nalasopara belt. "We have been studying the time and location of these thefts and posting our personnel accordingly," said senior inspector Prasad Pandhre, Andheri GRP. According to Pandhre, the Andheri GRP outpost alone recorded approximately 260 to 280 cases of theft. 
 
 Sources said the reason for such a high number of theft cases is a change in the process of registration by the police. Earlier, FIRs were not recorded in instances where valuables were lost by the commuter. Now these too are recorded as thefts.
 
 Meanwhile, cases of drugging on long-distance trains are being tackled by shooting videos of passengers as they enter trains at its point of origin. "These videos can later be shown to a victim of drugging and would help identify the culprit who is usually a co-passenger," an official said.
