Pune: Upset with the government’s decision to put just 450 positions up for recruitment — despite having nearly 3,000 vacancies — the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) aspirants have planned a protest march on Thursday. The aspirants will agitate on March 1 at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan.   The commission had publicised the recruitment plan in an advertisement issued on Tuesday. Students claimed that though there was a proposal to fill up 1,500-2,000 posts, the recent advertisement looks to fill up only 450 posts — 28 assistant room officers, 34 tax inspectors and 387 police sub-inspectors.    Navnath Salgar, an aspirant, said, “The government has issued the advertisement exactly at the time of agitation to divert the attention of stakeholders.” Mahesh Bade, another candidate, said, “Almost eight lakh candidates prepare for the MPSC exam. The number of posts up for recruitment is dismal.”    Meanwhile, MPSC officials said, “The advertisement was issued based on the requirements given by various departments. We do not decide on the number of posts and vacancies.”
