Mumbai: Hotelier  , booked for harbouring  , has alleged that Congress MLA   influenced the police to act against him. “I had filed an   against Nitesh. I am not a bookie. The crime branch questioned me for three consecutive days but did not find any links with the betting racket. My conversations with another bookie pertained to some business and not betting,” he said.

 Nitesh told TOI: “I have submitted evidence to police. Isn’t it strange that within 24 hours of Karia’s arrest, 1Above partners were picked up, indicating his nexus?” 
 
 Karia said he was in Worli when he heard about the fire. “I rushed there and saw   (1Above partner) whom I knew for six months. I returned home around 6am and in a few minutes, Kripesh called to ask if he could come home. He came along with few friends. When I woke up at 10.30am, they had left,” Karia said adding that he didn’t know one of them had left their car there. “The uncle and kin of 1Above owners held on the same charges were out on bail the next day, but I had to move the HC,’’ he said.—S Ahmed Ali
