RAJKOT: A family of four was wiped out in an accident on   late on Sunday night. 

 The family of Parsottam Bhalara was returning from Rajkot in their car after attending the saas-bahu mass gathering. When they reached Vondh, a container trailor speeding from the wrong side crashed into their car, leaving three of them dead on the spot. Bhalara succumbed to the injuries at a hospital in Bhachau.

  Bhalara’s wife Ranjan (63), son Anshil (30) and daughter-in-law Beena (28) died on the spot. Anshil’s eight-month-old daughter miraculously escaped unhurt in the accident. 
 
 Bhalara had retired as an engineer from the Kandla port and his brother was the former collector of Kutch.
 
 Police have launched a manhunt for the errant truck driver.
