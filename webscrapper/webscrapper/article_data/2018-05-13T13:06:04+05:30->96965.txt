PATNA: The state   headquarters bustled with excitement on Saturday evening as the party’s functionaries felt the marriage of the son of their ‘mahanayak’ (Lalu Prasad) is like the one in their own families.

 Clad in well starched and pressed khadi kurta and pyjamas, most of them had left the party’s state headquarters on Beer Chand Patel Marg by 5pm for the   ground — the venue for ‘varmaal’ (garlanding of each other by   and Aishwarya Rai).
 
 “The occasion is very big for all of us. It is the day of marriage in the family of our ‘mahanayak’. Naturally, we are excited. It is like marriage in our own family,” said Madan Sharma, the state president of RJD dastkar (handicrafts) cell.
 
 Sharma is coordinating between the office-bearers and the main reception committee comprising state president  , secretary general Alok Mehta and party   Bhola Yadav, constituted to oversee the deployment of the party’s office-bearers for various kinds of duties at the ‘varmal’ venue.
 
 RJD cultural cell functionary Nirbhay Ambedkar, a writer and film lyricist, said the party’s senior functionaries and those from the youth and students’ wings have been deputed at the main gate and other key points to guide the guests arriving to attend the function.
 
 “The general instruction to them is to maintain order and discipline. They themselves have to behave in a manner that does not inconvenience the guests in any way,” Sharma said.
 
 As a matter of fact, the formal invitation cards have been sent to all the former and present MPs, MLAs and MLCs, state office-bearers, executive committee members and district presidents, as well as to presidents of all the party cells.
