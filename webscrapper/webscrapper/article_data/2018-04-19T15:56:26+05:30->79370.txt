GHAZIABAD: A   carrying a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head was arrested on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, following a gunfight with police near   off NH 24 in Ghaziabad. 

 The accused, Tauseef (42), sustained a bullet wound on his right leg when police shot at him in retaliation after he opened fire at them. Cops said Tauseef was on a motorbike with an accomplice riding pillion when the police apprehended him.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, a police team laid a trap near   to nab Tauseef around 12am on Tuesday. His accomplice managed to escape. Tauseef has been admitted to a private hospital in Vaishali.
 
 “Tauseef was sentenced to 10 years in prison in an attempt to murder case in 2009 in Sikandrabad area of Bulandshahr. Currently, he was out on bail. In 2012, he was also named an accused in a murder case in Jewar area of Gautam Budh Nagar,” senior superintendent of police (SSP), Vaibhav Krishna told TOI.
 
 Subsequently, in a case of Arms Act in Gautam Budh Nagar in 2012, a local court had issued an arrest warrant against Tauseef.
 
 Last year, police in Auraiya district had announced a reward upon Tauseef. “A body of an unknown man was found in the Kotwali area in April 2017. An investigation revealed that Tauseef was one of the persons involved in the murder. Later, it came to light that the murder was committed during a robbery attempt,” said superintendent of police (SP) of Auraiya, Nageshwar Singh.
 
 The body was of a truck driver who had been kidnapped by Tauseef and his accomplices. They had murdered the driver and fled with the truck containing readymade garments. The truck was later recovered from Bulandshahr. On April 6, one of the accomplices of Tauseef had surrendered in a local court in Auraiya.
 
 The Ghaziabad police registered a case of attempt to murder against Tauseef in   police station on Wednesday for attacking the police team.
