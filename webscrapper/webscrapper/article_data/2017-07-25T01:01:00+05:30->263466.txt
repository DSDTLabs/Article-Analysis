Though the main exhibition by the students is held in December, students told us that this is the second most important event for them. “Students from all seven departments, including painting, wood craft, ceramics and textile, showcase their year’s work to examiners. It accounts for a major chuck of marks in the final examination,” said the college’s principal, Chatrapati Dutta. The common practice is to   the works of every department in the respective classrooms. This year, more than 150 works were on display, including paintings and sculptures. “This is a very exciting part of the examination. This is the time when we compare our works and know our standards. Besides, it’s always a special feeling when people come to see your work,” a student told us.
