AHMEDABAD: With the state   scheduled to be held later this year, the ruling   has again decided to lay more emphasis on resurfacing roads in the city. A meeting between contractors and   office bearers, including mayor Gautam Shah, was held on Friday.

 The BJP had launched a similar drive to resurface roads in 2015, just ahead of  . The chief secretary and then   had issued instruction to the AMC to focus on road repairs.
 
 Officials in AMC said that just before the election, BJP thought of getting the work completed in time. 
 
 The mayor and officials officially directed that resurfacing be completed before the onset of the monsoon and the people should not face any problems, but from the instructions it is clear their eye is on the 2017 elections.
