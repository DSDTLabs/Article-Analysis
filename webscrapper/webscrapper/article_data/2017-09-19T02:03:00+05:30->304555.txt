As part of the exercise to prevent boulder crashes in the dangerous Monkey Hill section, Central Railway (CR) has carried out an aerial survey of the 29km section using drones.

 The photos and videos shot by the drones were sent to experts of IIT-Bombay and Lucknow’s Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), so that they could study and propose a permanent solution.
 
 The railway authorities had approached RDSO last month, following two incidents of loose boulders derailing trains in this region. In the second incident, a rock had punched through the roof of a carriage and injured three passengers.
 
 According to officials, the drones give a comprehensive picture of the terrain and their photos prove useful to experts to determine how best to arrest the problem. “We have been trying to find a solution to the problem for sometime,” said CR chief public relations officer Sunil Udasi. 
 
 “With the terrain high and steep, we used drones to map the whole area. The stretch between Khandala to Thakurwadi is dangerous, mainly around Monkey Hill. Apart from the pictures, which were taken from all angles, videos were also recorded using the same drones,” Udasi said.
 
 The official said this should give the experts a holistic picture of the terrain, and would assist them in coming up with answers. “The experts will closely study (the pictures) and try to find a solution to the problem,” Udasi said. 
 
 Central Railway authorities had written a letter roping RDSO in their endeavour to arrest the rock fall in the area. A two-member RDSO team visited the spot last week and took stock. 
 
 “With rocks falling from a height, the impact is greater. One needs to find the reason why this is happening,” another official said.
