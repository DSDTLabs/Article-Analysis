CHANDIGARH: Eucalyptuses may have become a tall danger for many but tree lovers want to keep these trees, though not plant new ones, considering the groundwater level.Volunteer Rahul  , who keeps replanting trees in Chandigarh to save them from being axed, said: “Do not plant more eucalyptuses in the city but save the old ones for the sake of greenery and the image of old Chandigarh. 

 Imagine how bare Sector 17 will look without eucalyptuses.“ He says that a further dip in the groundwater level supports no new plantation but the old trees can be saved by pollarding (trimming to maintain height). “Cutting them down will do more harm than good. The old eucalyptuses pose a threat because they might fall over something or someone when it is windy , but if you cut off their heads when they reach 20 feet, you won't require axing these.“ Rajnish Wattas of the   group said: “Already , we are left with only a few eucalyptuses.
 
  Let them die out, unless some are diseased. There is no point in cutting these down until there is replacement.Some of these trees are of a rare variety .“
 
 Mahajan said the eucalyptus timber was important for agroforestry . “This is a king of timber trees, which grows fast and gives good privet in a few years. The   and   governments offer subsidy on planting saplings of colonel eucalyptus.“
 
 In March 2016, the-then mayor, Arun Sood, had asked for removing old eucalyptuses over the danger that was posed. He had suggested re placing these with traditional fruit-bearing trees. Even the schools that have these trees favour cutting when it's windy .
 
  president   said: “These trees have grown so big that they might fall anytime. It might break the walls these are planted along.
