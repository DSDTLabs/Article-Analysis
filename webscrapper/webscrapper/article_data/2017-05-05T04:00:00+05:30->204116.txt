Vadodara: Two persons were arrested on Thursday for attacking a food cart owner near Susen Circle and looting him of gold chain and Rs 37,000 cash late Wednesday night. One of their accomplices has been declared absconding.

 Cops said that Rakesh Patanwadia, Prashant Sakpal, both residents of Makarpura, and Shyam Yadav went to eat Chinese food at the food cart of Umesh Patel near Susen Circle. When the trio went to order food, Patel told them that he has closed his cart and was leaving for home. Enraged over his refusal, they started hurling expletives at Patel. Patanwadia then took out a pipe from his car and thrashed him, Manjalpur police said. The other two also joined Patanwadia in beating up Patel. Meanwhile, a passer-by tried to intervene but he too was slapped. The accused then snatched Patel’s gold chain worth Rs 45,000 and cash from his pocket. Patel said that when Sakpal beat the passer-by, he managed to run away from there. A police official said that Patanwadia and Sakpal are scrap dealers and used to sit on a bench near Patel’s food cart regularly. TNN
