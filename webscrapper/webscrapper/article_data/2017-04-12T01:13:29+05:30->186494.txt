They were directors of the bank during the period under inquiry.

 Under the Act, an inquiry against a cooperative society has to be completed within two-and-a-half years of the date of the order. In this case, a   was ordered on May 22, 2014, but inquiry officer Shivaji Pahinkar failed to complete it on time and fears were expressed in the corridors of power that the cooperative department will not be able to fix responsibility on the erring bank directors. When this was brought to the CM’s notice, he had told TOI that the law would be amended to complete the probe and a probe will be conducted against Pahinkar. 
 
 During the budget session of the state legislature, cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh moved a Bill to empower the inquiry officer to complete the probe even after the stipulated period. “We amended the law...so that on-going probes will be taken to logical conclusion,” he said. — Prafulla Marpakwar
