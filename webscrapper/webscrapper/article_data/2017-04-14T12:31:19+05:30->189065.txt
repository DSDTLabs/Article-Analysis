GURUGRAM: A 30-year-old man was   in   in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday for allegedly   his wife on March 31. 

 The accused, Lakhan Singh, confessed to his crime and claimed that he killed 27-year-old Sudha as he doubted her character. He was produced at a city court on Thursday that sent him to one day police remand. 
 
 “On March 31, I had an argument with Sudha. In a fit of rage, I hit her with a utensil on her nose. As she fell down, I strangled her with the help of the religious threads she wore on her neck. As I wanted to confirm her death, I again strangled her using a dupatta. After she died, I locked the house and left for my village in Pilibhit district of Uttar Pradesh,” Lakhan told cops. 
 
 It may be noted that Sudha’s father was the first one to have spotted her body in her Rajendra Park house, when he had gone there to visit his daughter. 
 
 As Lakhan was absconding, an FIR was registered against him following a complaint from Dharm Prakash, Sudha’s father, under section 302 (murder) of the IPC at Rajendra Park police station. 
 
  “During investigation we got to know that Lakhan was seen in Bareilly. A team was sent there and following a raid, we managed to arrest Lakhan,” said inspector Ajaybeer Bhadana, SHO, Rajendra park police station.
