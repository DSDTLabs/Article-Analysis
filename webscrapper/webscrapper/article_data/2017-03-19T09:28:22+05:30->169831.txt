JALANDHAR: Opposition Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has asked Punjab government to remain prepared to summon a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to pass a resolution against constructing the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal in case the   decided against the state on March 28.

 “Going by the previous pronouncements of the SC, it seems imminent that the decision would be against Punjab, and our government should be ready to face the situation to defend the interests of the state,” said AAP chief whip  , while addressing a press conference here on Saturday.
 
 Citing the Cauvery water dispute, the Bholath MLA Khaira said notwithstanding the SC directions to Karnatka to release water for Tamil Nadu, the former had refused and passed a unanimous resolution in the state assembly. “Similarly Punjab can defend its rights on the its river waters under constitutional provisions when the state has not even enough water for its own needs,” he said.
 
 He said as the Punjab Congress chief and now as chief minister Captain   had been taking a clear stand on the issue. Khaira said he expected that the CM would take the required measures and opposition would also support. Asked about his party convener Arvind Kejriwal’s views on the issue, Khaira said stand of the AAP legislative party in Punjab assembly was very clear and there was no need to drag in the national leadership.
 
 Khaira defends AAP MLAs seeking vehicles, security
 
 Khaira defended AAP MLAs accepting government vehicles and security saying that most of their legislators came from humble backgrounds and they did need a vehicle to move around for public causes. “We are raising strong voice against anti-social elements, and we need security also. There is nothing wrong in that. A simple Toyota Innova vehicle and two gunmen were just the basic needs and not some VIP culture. I also need security as I have been speaking out against all types of mafia,” he said.
