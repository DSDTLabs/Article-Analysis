CHENNAI: Nearly 10 days after nearly 15 free-ranging   were seen struggling to survive at a spot in Taramani that was cleared of vegetation, feeding on  , the   has done little to relocate them. Several residents of the area claim seeing some of the animals straying on to busy   in search of   and running the risk of being run over by speeding vehicles.

 A regular visitor to the area said a good samaritan had been feeding the deer, bringing them food from his home, but environmental activists say forest department officials do not seem to have taken the issue with the seriousness it deserves. The department has to act swiftly, they add.
 
 When contacted, Chennai wildlife warden K Geethanjali said they had received calls about the straying of   from the IIT-Madras campus to the Taramani area, but said they had to move cautiously. Deer are sensitive animals which when cornered could be affected by stress that can even lead to death. A few foresters would remain in the area until the deer get accustomed to their presence and then start devising ways of trapping them, shye said.
 
 It is only after thatt can they be translocated to a forested area, she said.
