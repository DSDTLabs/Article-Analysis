NAVI MUMBAI: A mere 10 minutes of heavy downpour around 9am on Monday was enough to flood Thane-Belapur road at Mukand subway and Sathe Nagar, a stone’s throw away from NMMC’s Digha ward office. 

 This led to   snarls along a 3km stretch between Airoli Naka and Vitawa, incoveninencing motorists during morning peak hours.
 
 If this was not enough, the entire Sathe Nagar slum pocket, which has been a low-lying area, was submerged due to blocked drainage line leading to panic among the residents. This has exposed the shoddy pre-monsoon nullah cleaning work. 
 
 “Last night there was no rain but we woke up to a flooded Mukand subway. It took me around 30 minutes to reach Digha which is just a km away,” said Santosh Dhal. 
 
 NMMC deputy engineer Sharad Kale said, “These are two spots where waterlogging has been an issue. I have flagged off the issue to the local ward officer.”
 
 Local traffic cops had a tough time managing the flow of vehicles during peak hours. “I have asked for regular cleaning of the drainage line at Mukand subway,” Digha ward officer Prakash Waghmare said.
