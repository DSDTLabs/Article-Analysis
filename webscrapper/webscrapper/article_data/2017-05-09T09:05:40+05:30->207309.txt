You might not see Dr Gulati in   now, but the Jaipur junta had a jolly good time, laughing at  's jokes as he brought his famous character, Dr Mashoor Gulati, to the city.

 Sunil, who came to Jaipur on Saturday, performed at a sangeet ceremony held on the outskirts of the city. Dressed as Dr Gulati, Sunil entered the venue on a camel as the song Aaj Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai played in the background.Wearing his `England se laaye hue chashme', the comedian began his performance by cracking a joke on the bride's dress. He said, "Inhone 12 metre ki dress peheni hai. 15 kapde ban sakte the isme."
 
 While Sunil did not mention   during the entire performance, he did talk about the show and Navjot Singh Sidhu.He also spoke about the various female characters that he has played. We heard him saying, "Mai bhi ladies banta hu show pe and meri aapse bhi jyada daadi (beard) aati hai."
 
  
  
 He also mentioned about Navjot Singh Sidhu and referred to The Kapil Sharma Show as "humara" show. He said to a guest ,who was laughing out loud, "Aap kahin na jayein. Humare show mein Sidhu sahab ki jagah aa jayein." Sunil also did gidda with the ladies at the ceremony .
 
 Earlier in the day, we managed to speak with Sunil at the Jaipur airport where he spoke about his love for the city . "I love coming to Jaipur . I like the city, its simplicity and also the food. "When we asked him about what's happening on the professional front, he dodged the question by saying, â€œMai just soke utha hoon. I am really tired."
