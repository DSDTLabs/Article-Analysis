ALLAHABAD: There is some bad news for those   who were thinking of putting away online registration for board examinations to the last minute. 

    of Secondary Education would give adverse entry and stop salary payment to principals of secondary schools who delay online registration of students appearing for board examinations in 2018.
 
 Secretary of UP Board,  , said the move is aimed to avoid any last-minute technical snag in the central server. 
 
 "Last year, several principals had not utilised the one-month period they were given to upload the details on UP Board's official website. Due to the deluge of registrations at the last-minute, there was a technical snag in the central server," she added. The board said schools would not be given any extra time if they fail to register online within the given time.
 
 Those students of Class X and XII who were not registered with UP Board will not be allowed to sit for the examinations.
 
 Officials said the procedure for filling online application forms for private and regular students had started on July 20 and would continue till October 10 , however, due to the lethargic attitude of the principals the rate of registration was slow across the state.
 
 Srivastava said due to late registrations, all UP Board schools suffered. This year too, the registration process has already been delayed by over a month. "To avoid a repetition of last year's events we have decided to give adverse entry to principals as well as   (DIoS) who are entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the registration process in each district," said the UP Board secretary. 
 
 The board has also maintained that only those students would be allowed to appear for board examinations whose attendance is 75% or more. 
 
 There are 20,945 schools affiliated to UP Board in the state.
