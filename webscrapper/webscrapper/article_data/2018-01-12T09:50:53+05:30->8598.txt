NEW DELHI: Stock markets saw a fresh surge on Friday morning as   jumped a further 100 points, hitting a fresh all-time high of 34,638.42.

 The BSE index opened with a gain of 75.50 points on 34,578.99 while the broader 50-share NSE   also started trading on an all-time high of 10,682.55, opening 31.35 points above previous closing.
 
 The Street which has seen an impressive bull run since the turn of the year, is set to surge further on back of improved third quarter results. 
 
 Among sectoral sub-indices, apart from Nifty IT all other sectors were trading in the green. The IT sector saw a drag mainly on the back of the   stock which was losing more than a per cent in morning trade after poor showing in the third quarter.
 
 ICICI Bank, HDFC and Larsen & Toubro were the major gainers while TCS, PowerGrid and Yes Bank were losing.
