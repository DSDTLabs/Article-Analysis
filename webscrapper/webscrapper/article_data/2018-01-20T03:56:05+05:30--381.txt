NEW DELHI: The Davos platform provides an opportunity for global networking and the world will look forward to hear India's plans and prospects from the "horse's mouth", PM Narendra   said ahead of his visit to the world economic forum next week . 

 " It is opportunity for networking. There are many people there from business and academics to policymakers. India is a centre of attraction and our democratic values reassure the world which expects direct communication with India on its policies and possibilities. It wants to hear from the horse's mouth. It wants to hear what the 'mukhia (leader)' is saying. I will put the achievements of our citizens before the world," the PM said in an interview with Zee News. 
 
 Modi said the EPFO figures on jobs should be taken seriously and that they are not "hawa baazi". "The figures show that there were 70 lakh new members. "The 'Mudra Yojna' is another step in this direction. We are in the right direction and will keep youth in mind as well as skill development," he said.
 
 The PM said he wanted to fully leverage the fact that after 30 years, there was a government with a full majority in India. "People's mandate is important," he said. He also said this had helped the government take decisions that had resulted in India moving 30 ranks in the 'ease of doing business' rankings. "The world knows the importance of this," he said.
 
 He said besides GST and demonetisation, the effort to bring the poor into the banking system, improving presence of girls in schools by building toilets, delivering families from wooden stoves by providing LPG, electrifying thousands of villages, providing neem coating for urea and insurance for the poor at 90 paise were big achievements.
 
 "GST is testimony to our federal structure and this is why we have taken big steps towards 'one nation, one tax'. I am confident we will get results," Modi said, while agreeing that there will be some pangs.
