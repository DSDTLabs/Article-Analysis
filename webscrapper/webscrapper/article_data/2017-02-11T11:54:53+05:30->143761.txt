Simar, Maataji, Piyush and Roshni go to the temple, while on the other hand, Anjali hides a letter that Tao Ji gives to Saroj.

 At the temple, Piyush spots Vaidehi while praying with Roshni, though he can't see her properly. Without saying a word, he runs to meet her which makes Roshni and Simar upset. Later, he comes back and as an excuse tells Simar that he had forgotten his wallet in the car.
 
 
  
 While Saroj is selling old newspapers and books, Anjali sneaks in the letter that Tao Ji gave to her earlier in the day. To distract her attention from checking the stuff, she calls on the landline and succeeds in her mission.
 
 Piyush gets a call from Lonavala and then receives a paper with the name of a resort in Lonavala. When Simar sees that paper, she suggests that Roshni and Piyush go to the resort for Valentine's. Piyush agrees thinking that he might meet Vaidehi there, and Roshni thinks that it is the first step that Piyush has made to save their relationship.
