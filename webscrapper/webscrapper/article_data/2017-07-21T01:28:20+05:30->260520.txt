NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to turn   site into a  . North corporation commissioner P K Gupta said they had planned to reclaim the landfill site and had invited bidders some time back but because of the heavy expenses involved, they decided to turn it into a green belt.

 Gupta said that the reclamation plan will cost at least Rs 900 crore to the cash-strapped civic body. “We had floated the tender and bidders were invited. But when we took a look at the plan, we found many issues. Apart from being too expensive, reclamation would have required burning up of garbage, resulting in pollution,” he said.
 
 Commissioned in 1993, the landfill site became functional in 1994. By 2007, it was declared ‘exhausted’ but the civic body continued to dump garbage there.
 
 Delhi generates about 9,000 metric tonnes of waste every day and about 3,000 MT is dumped at the   site. Gupta cited a   study and said, “The garbage has lost all its energy and calorific value. It cannot be used for road construction project. We will cover the garbage with a layer of soil and turn it into a green cover. We will construct parks on it after that.
 
 From several years, there have been cases of fire because of excessive methane gas. The corporation had proposed a waste-to-energy plant but scraped the plan after the study”. He added that methane gas will be extracted from the garbage site through bio-methanation process before turning it into a green belt.
 
 Ghazipur and   landfill sites were also declared ‘exhausted’ a long time ago but civic bodies continue to use them. Gupta said that they have acquired 12 acres of land near the Bhalswa landfill site, which will be used for dumping garbage. “We cannot stop dumping garbage at Bhalswa at once as we do not have an alternative. We have acquired land from DDA, which will be converted into a landfill site,” he said.
