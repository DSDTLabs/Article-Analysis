JAIPUR: If your child is applying for admissions at entry level (kindergarten or first standard) in schools, the chances of your ward being selected are high if you only have a single child or a girl child.

 Private schools are devising new methods for admissions after interviews were banned under the RTE Act.
 
 With the   season for the 2017-18 academic year beginning in the state, many schools have adopted several criteria to promote social causes.
 
 To support the government of India campaign ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padao,’   has waived admission fees for girl candidates. “This campaign intends to sensitize and generate awareness towards creating equal value for the girl child and promote girls’ education. Our decision to waive fees is strengthening this campaign,” said Karuna Yadav, principal of KGP.
 
 Many schools in Jaipur have decided to give extra points for girl candidates during admissions, and hopes this would increase the enrolment of girls in schools. These schools have several criteria and award points on a scale of 1 to 10/100. Admissions are granted on the basis of these points.
 
 Saint Xavier’s School in Nevta is also ensuring gender equality in admissions this year. “This year, we have decided to give equal seats to both boys and girls. This will help to create a diverse ecosystem in a classroom,” said Father John Ravi. The school is located in the rural area and such an initiative intends to attract more girls. In most co-ed schools in the city, boys outnumber girls by a fair margin.
 
  is giving preference to siblings in all its branches. “It will be the main criteria for admissions as families can manage a common schedule. Our second preference is for children with parents having transferable jobs,” said Jyoti Rana, principal of Ryan International School.
