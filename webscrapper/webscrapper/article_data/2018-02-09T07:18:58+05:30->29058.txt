DARJEELING: Striking a rare conciliatory note, chief minister   on Thursday urged the Hills political parties to put behind the eight-month long agitation and work together to develop Darjeeling. 

 Even during the Himal Terai Dooars Sports Festival prize distribution ceremony on Wednesday, the chief minister had said Darjeeling belonged to its people and the state government had no intention to interfere.
 
 Shedding her usual hard-stance, Banerjee asked Hills political parties to cooperate and work together to usher development in the region. "I request the political parties to follow their ideologies to which I have no problem," she said.
 
 "Let us forget whatever happened. Let us work together for the future of Darjeeling," she added.
 
 On Thursday, the chief minister sat for separate meetings with the different political parties of the Hills, including the GJM, GNLF, AIGL and chairmen of thirteen development boards at Raj Bhawan in Darjeeling.
 
 The CM announced jobs for youths of the disbanded GLP and three month's pending (strike duration) salary to teachers. "We have given appointment to youths who have done well in the police sports festival as civic police volunteers. We will also give similar jobs to those GLP youths but they must not have any police records. The teachers will also get their pending salary but they must conduct extra classes to make up for the three-month loss," Banerjee said.
 
 The chief minister also promised to invite major industrial houses to Darjeeling for a meeting to explore establishing industries to generate employment in the Hills.
