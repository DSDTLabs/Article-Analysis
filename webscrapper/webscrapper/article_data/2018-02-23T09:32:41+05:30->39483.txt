CHENNAI : A flock of bright coloured feathers have made water bodies around   bird sanctuary their home for this season. After a good monsoon restored water bodies, at least half a dozen rare birds have been sighted during a two-day synchronised count conducted earlier this month. 

 The annual water bird census this time threw up a pleasant surprise, says Chennai wildlife warden  . “There were many more rare birds sighted this year when compared to last year. Water bodies in   near Madurantakam, Andavakkam, Pudhupattu, Karikili, Sithalamangalam, apart from   island near Pulicat were covered in the census,” she said.
 
 Black bittern (Dupetar flavicollis), common pochard (Aythya ferina), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), Indian scops owl (Otus bakkamoena), Bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica), Terek sandpiper (Xenus cinereus) and Ruddy turnstone (Areneria interpres) were among the rare birds sighted.
 
 “All these wetlands, within a 5km radius from  , are feeding grounds for migratory and terrestrial birds. Madurantakam lake was not filled to the brim in 2015 and 2016. However, last year’s copius rain restored it and cleaned the water, which is an important factor that attracted these rare migrants,” said range officer G Subbiah. The lakes in the Vedanthangal bird sanctuary too have nearly 15ft water. 
 
 For avid birdwaters, this is the best time to catch the avian show as some have started to return. “The migrants which came early to the sanctuary last September has started to return with the young ones. White ibis, glossy ibis and open-billed storks were the early ones,” he said. 
 
 Painted stork, which was the last to visit the sanctuary has laid eggs and is expected to stay till April. They are the last migrants to arrive and leave after completing roosting and breeding activities. And if you are planning a birding trip, the sanctuary will be open till May.
