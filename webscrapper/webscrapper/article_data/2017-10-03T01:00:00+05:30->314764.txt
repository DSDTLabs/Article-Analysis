CHHAPRA: Hundreds of shopkeepers of local Hathwa market are prone to serious health problems as they are not provided with a place to relieve themselves during shopping hours despite paying good amount of revenue to Chhapra Municipal Corporation. According to an estimate, the market has a daily transaction of over Rs1 crore and higher during marriage season.

 This marketing complex was constructed by Hathwa Raj, but due to non-payment of municipal taxes, the then municipal body had to take it over. The market lacks basic facilities like toilets, parking lots, drinking water and drainage. The shopkeepers cut a sorry figure when the customers ask for toilet. Rajesh Kumar, owner of a cloth shop there, said, “I have developed kidney problem due to non-availability of   in the market.” Sometimes, they seek permission from the nearby banks to use their toilets.
 
 Although there is enough space in market complex for constructing a toilet to be used on payment. “Whenever any such attempt has been made, it has been objected to by the Hathwa Estate manager on the plea that except the shops, the government or local administration has no right for any construction” said A K Rai, commissioner of Chhapra Nagar Nigam. “A case is also pending before the Patna high court in this regard,” he added. 
 
 However, another shopkeeper Bablu Rahi said, “The shopkeepers and customers suffer in the dispute between the local body and the Hathwa Estate.”
