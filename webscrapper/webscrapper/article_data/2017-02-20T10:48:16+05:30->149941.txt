NAGPUR: District collector Sachin Kurve has imposed a fine of about Rs 50 lakh on   and others for misuing urban land ceiling (ULC) land located near Hotel Radisson Blu. The land, consisting of 72 plots released by the state government under   Talegaon Dabhade scheme on April 21, 2003, meant for housing the poor is being used as a commercial lawn.

 TOI in its March 5, 2015, edition had exposed how Vrindavan Lawn was constructed on 72 plots. Following TOI's expose, two activists, T H Naidu and  , had lodged complaint with the ULC department demanding action. The department delayed the action and sat pretty after conducting panchnama in May 2015. On November 24, 2015, the ULC department conducted panchnama in a proper manner and submitted the report to the then additional collector  . 
 
 The land was declared surplus under the Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) Act and the state government had sanctioned a layout comprising 72 plots for weaker sections. However, Dhanwate instead of developing the plots, gave the power of attorney to builder Vijay Dangre, who sold it to one  . 
 
 As per the government's approved layout plan, the surplus land was about 1.27 lakh sq ft of which about 88,000 sq ft land was earmarked for 72 plots. This space is about a sixth of Kasturchand Park. Open space was 36,883.55 sq ft and 2,418.43 sq ft was for internal roads.
 
 The notice issued to Dhanwates by Kurve said the competent authority (ULC) visited the land plot on May 8, 2015 and November 24, 2015, and found that it was being used commercially. A showcause notice was issued to Sanjay Agrawal also on September 28, 2015. 
 
 The revenue department then asked Dhanwate to pay a fine of Rs 46.10 lakh. As this was not paid at that time, the amount has now increased to Rs49.97 lakh. The lease would be renewed only after payment of the fine, the notice said.
 
 Kurve made it clear that the lease was only for Talegaon Dabhade scheme and any other use of the land should not be without governmentâ€™s permission.
