Tirunelveli: A man committed suicide by consuming poison after murdering his wife in Tirunelveli on Monday afternoon. The deceased were identified as Anthoniammal, 36, and Mohan, 48. The duo was rushed to the Tirunelveli Government Medical College and Hospital but they were declared dead on arrival.

 Preliminary inquiry revealed that they fought frequently over loans they had obtained as they were finding it difficult to repay them. Their family claimed that the couple got married 12 years ago. Anthoniammal was his second wife.
 
 Mohan worked in a fish stall and Anthoniammal worked as a domestic help. The couple had two sons Gobi, 11, and Sankaran, 7, studying in classes VI and III respectively and a daughter Nandhini, 10, studying in Class V. 
 
 The couple was not in good terms for close to a month as the moneylenders used to come to their house at Sambakadai Street in Palayamkottai, and demanded repayment.
