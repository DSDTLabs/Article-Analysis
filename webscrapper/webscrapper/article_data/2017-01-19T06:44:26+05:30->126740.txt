MUMBAI: Labour minister   said on the   matter on Wednesday that he had informed the revenue department to take necessary steps to recover dues.

 “Cambata Aviation has to pay over Rs 100 crore to their employees at any cost,“ Nilangekar said.
 
 The aviation firm's CEO, Irish national Pat Casserly , said Cambata Aviation “does not have any property or land in India and Eros premises is not Cambata Aviation company's property . I guess it is the property of Cambata Trust but not Aviation.“
 
 On January 5, social worker Anjali Damania met Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at his residence Matoshree to sort out the employees' dues matter as the Sena union was active in the company . The dues are pending since February 2016. The airline ground handling company stopped operations from August 2016. The company's move meant leaving over 2,700 employees in Mumbai in the lurch.
 
 Damania said employees have not been paid from March last year. “The amount in all is Rs 109.8 crore as of Jan 2017. The industrial court passed four orders from July 2016, two of which directed initiation of recovery procedures by seizing Cambata Aviation's assets.“ The property, originally owned by the state government, was given on lease to the Cambata Trust in 1934 for 99 years.
 
 An official from the collector's office said there seems to have been lease term violations in the building. “The collector's office leased out the property, but it has been sub-leased. Portions have been sold without intimating the government. We are reviewing the lease agreement and will check if there were any alterations or violations in the building.“
