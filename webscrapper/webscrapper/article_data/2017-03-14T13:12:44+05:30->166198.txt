NAVI MUMBAI: Ram Kumar was brought to StemRx Bioscience after 45 per cent of his   was burned due to a   during work. The impact of the burns led to a charred look on his face and body. Joint mobility due to burn was also reduced. The outer layer of the skin was affected; facial burns were of grade II level and in some instances grade III burns and this led to the deeper structures like the subcutaneous tissue also being affected.
 
 Dr. Pradeep Mahajan from the institute said, “Growth factors derived from platelets, cells, fibroblasts and collagen-based gel were used during treatment. In addition, in areas with deep burns, sheets of PGLA coated with cells and growth factors were used. Different medication and treatments were imparted every day and the progress was documented. Closed dressing was avoided. Blood transfusion and supplementary fluids were given intravenously to maintain systemic homeostasis.”
  
 Within two days, a notable improvement in his condition was observed, the swelling and the charred appearance started reducing or fading. Mild eyelids movements were noticed and on the third day, burns started drying on the face and the patient could open his mouth and eyes. 
 
 “On the 5th and 6th day following the treatment, dry scales from face and body started peeling off. It was impressive to see new skin forming within a week of treatment with cells and growth factors. By conventional modalities, it takes more than eight weeks for healing to happen and further many months for patient to be able to regain joint and facial movements,” added Dr. Mahajan.
  
 By the 10th day, of the treatment, dry scales completely peeled off and by the 14th day patient had no tenderness or burning pain and his joint movements became free as well.
