 ’, starring Prabhas and   hits theatres, fans finally had the haunting question – Why did   kill  ? – answered.

But was it enough to put fans at ease? Watch the video below to find out.

 
  
 When asked the question, Sathyaraj said, “It is very simple. Producers, Shobu sir and Prasad sir paid me very well. And Rajamouli told me ‘Kill Baahubali’, so I killed him. Otherwise, how can I kill Prabhas? He has been my darling since Mirchi (their 2003 film together).”
