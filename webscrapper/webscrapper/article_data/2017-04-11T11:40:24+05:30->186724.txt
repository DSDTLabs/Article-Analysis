NAGPUR: “I have received innumerable invitations to Pakistan but have never accepted them till now as I didn't wish to entertain those who cause trouble in my country,” said renowned bhajan singer   Jalota while sharing his plans to visit the neighbouring country in October this year. “I agreed now as the invitation has come from a   temple there,” he said. Jalota will be performing at   in Pakistan. 

 Jalota was interacting with the media ahead of his performance in the city at the foundation day celebrations of Shri Ram Bhakt Hanuman mandir at  .
 
 The singer who enjoyed tremendous popularity in the eighties for his bhajans said that the genre remains popular till date. “Now there are more than ten television channels with religion as content. People can tune any of them and listen to devotional music day long.” 
 
 On the trend of devotional songs being based on film music, Jalota said that bhajan does not have any form. “But I still don’t like parodies being made. It should be soothing and sound decent.” 
 
 Commenting on total absence of bhajans in films, the singer said, “Television serials are now the medium for this genre. There are so many serials based on mythological figures that films have moved away from religious themes.”
 
 Speaking further, he said that   has a genre of music had an appeal for the youth because it had changed its form as needed. “What we call Sufi now was qawwali in the past decades. Today it is a fusion of western instruments and classical gayaaki,” he said.
 
 “My new compositions ride on the popularity of my old songs and I still enjoy singing them,” he said terming ‘aisi laagi lagan’ as one of his all-time favourite. “I add new verses or couplets to them to give a refreshing touch,” he said.
 
 Terming his total mastery over the harmonium as natural gift, Jalota said that he had never touched the electronic keyboard. “The sounds emanating from it are not real,” he said.
