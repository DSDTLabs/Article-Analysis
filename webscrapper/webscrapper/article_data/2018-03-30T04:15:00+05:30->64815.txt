Ahmedabad: A 24-year-old volunteer with the Ahmedabad Traffic Brigade (ATB) filed a complaint with Anandnagar police for assault on Wednesday afternoon.

 Investigators said Ravi Pattani, 24, a resident of Naroda, is a volunteer with the ATB and is posted at A Division traffic police station for traffic management. On March 28, he was on duty at the crossroads near the IOC petrol pump close to Shyamal Crossroads.
 
 “At about 12.45pm, an accident took place at the crossroads. Pattani rushed to clear the jam. When he intervened, one scooter rider slapped him. Pattani pushed him in self-defence and the accused, later identified as Harirajsinh Gohil, allegedly beat him up. According to his complaint, Gohil and his father Sanjaysinh threatened him with dire consequences if he was seen at the crossroads again,” said an Anandnagar police official, adding that statements of the accused are yet to be recorded to ascertain how the incident came to pass. tnn
