KOCHI: The central police on Wednesday afternoon conducted raid at Maharaja’s College hostel and recovered  , including machetes, iron rods and wooden sticks. 

 The raid followed a complaint filed by the college principal, N L Beena, after resident tutors staying at the hostel found the weapons.
 
 According to sources, two resident tutors found the weapons on Tuesday. 
 
 “The rooms were checked on suspicion of people visiting the rooms even after the closure of the hostel. The principal was alerted after the finding,” said a faulty member adding that four rooms on the first floor of the staff quarters were converted as hostel rooms after the closure of the old hostel.
 
 Meanwhile, students claimed that the seizure was staged. 
 
 “The students had left the building about a month ago. The hostel was closed on March 30 and a sudden ‘discovery’ is suspicious. The only people living on the premises are a few faculty members and there is a chance that they had planted it,” said a student.
 
 A few students raised objection against the raid when the police personnel inspected the rooms to recover the stashed ‘tools’ around 3pm. 
 
 Alleging that the raid is to defame students of the college, the students argued with the principal.
 
 “The students were staying at the staff hostel after the closure of the old hostel. The rooms were locked and students were not occupying it as the college is on vacation. It should be probed whether any anti-social elements are camping there and who brought the weapons,” said SFI district secretary V M Junaid. 
 
 Meanwhile, the central police have filed a case under the Arms Act.
 
 “The weapons were   and a case has been registered. Further details can be known only after investigation,” said Central station house officer  .
 
 Earlier, in January 19, a group of students had burnt the chair of the principal here. SFI   district unit had expelled three student leaders who led the agitation back then.
