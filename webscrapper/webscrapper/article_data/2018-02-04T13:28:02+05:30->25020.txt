COIMBATORE: Collector TN Hariharan has cancelled the order passed in January to regularise a park site, which a private property developer had encroached upon to set up a sewage treatment plant.

 According to the collector, the 10 cents of land in question belongs to the panchayat and it was earmarked for a park.
 
 The land was located in the property named   at  , which falls under   village panchayat. The property developers,  , however, constructed a sewage treatment plant there. The layout was approved by the directorate of town and country planning in 2010.
 
 The property developers all the way maintained that they had set up the sewage treatment plant for the benefit of the people and they had got a favourable court order as well. The court had, on the other hand, directed the local planning authority to take steps to remove the encroachment within a month in 2016. But no action was taken by concerned officials.
 
 Meanwhile, residents petitioned the district collector against the non-functional sewage treatment plant. After various inspections and reports, block development officer ordered to seal the plant.
 
 Later, the district collector ordered the block development officer to regularise the site and allow the sewage treatment plant to function there.
 
 However, on Friday, the district collector cancelled the order officially and asked the block development officer to take steps to shift the plant from the site earmarked for park.
