  As a first step, you should share with your wife exactly how this has left you feeling. In this situation it is essential that you convey your true feelings of pain and betrayal, without resorting to sarcasm or taunts. Try to keep your anger aside and ask yourself whether it is possible for you to forgive her. I understand that this is not an easy decision, and it will take time for both of you to reconcile your differences. Donâ€™t beat yourself up for choosing her as your life partner. It might be useful to revisit the strengths of your relationship and focus on what you first liked about your wife. Are these things still important to you? Do they still hold true?
  
  Trust, once broken, takes a long time to be rebuilt. It is also true that with sustained effort, all differences can be overcome. For this, both partners need to show a high level of commitment to the relationship. It might be too soon to completely get over this incident, but you need to decide whether or not this is something you want to work towards. You and your wife will benefit from seeking professional help of a counsellor, who will be able to guide you in deciding how you wish to proceed with this relationship.
