BICHOLIM/POINGUINIM: Residents of Pilgao, Bicholim are living under the threat of a possible attack from a leopard that has made its presence felt in the village after about two years. "Villagers have reported three leopard sightings in the area during early morning or late evening hours," panch   said.

 With the cashew harvesting season set to begin soon, villagers are apprehensive. "People are afraid to go to the forest and the cashew plantations. We've informed the forest department and their officers have visited the village. We want them to lay a trap to catch the animal," Jalmi said.
 
 Meanwhile, a two-year-old female leopard, which had fallen in a 12 feet well at   near Galgibaga in  , was rescued by forest staff early on Tuesday. They were informed by the patrol police on duty about a leopard that was struggling to get out of a well. They used a trap cage to retrieve the big cat which was later shifted to the   wildlife sanctuary.
