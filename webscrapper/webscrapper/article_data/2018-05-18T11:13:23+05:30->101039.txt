HYDERABAD: A video showing a doctor accepting money for issuing a   certificate has exposed corruption at state-run  . An inquiry was ordered following the alleged expose. The video was posted on twitter on Thursday.

 
 “Sir, can you please look into the above matter and video shared by the person (sic) of Osmania General Hospital? Please take necessary action against such corrupt people @hydcitypolice @shoafzalgunj,” read the tweet posted from the handle@Violent_Lad. It was also alleged that some doctors and resident medical officers at the hospital were corrupt.
 
 This is the second such case in a week in which a doctor at   has come under scrutiny for alleged corruption. In the previous case, a medical officer issued a fake fitness certificate to a dead person. About a fortnight ago, police also initiated investigation into a complaint about corruption at   government hospital. In this case, police recovered 173 medical certificates with doctors signatures on them. Four doctors were under the scanner.
 
 “Corruption has been rampant at hospitals and has been going on for the last few years. I have given clear instructions that such issuing of certificates should stop immediately and people found guilty of such behaviour will be removed. Touts who help with organising certificates are often insiders hence we have asked for rotation of security guards and staff. We are also planning to remove doctors from the medical registry if found guilty,” said Director of Medical Education, Dr  .
 
 “We are viewing it (current video) very seriously. It appears that the certificate is being issued to a person who is not being treated or admitted at the hospital. By giving fake medical certificates, government employees are cheating the government. This will not be tolerated,” Dr Ramesh Reddy said.
