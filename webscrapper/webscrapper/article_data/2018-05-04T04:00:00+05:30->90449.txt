Rajkot: The body of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl was found floating in a pond on the outskirts of Bela village, some 10km away from Morbi, on Thursday morning. 

 She was murdered and it is suspected that she might have been raped by an unidentified person on Wednesday night. 
 
 The girl’s mother had put her to sleep on a cot on Wednesday night. Her parents — labourers from Bihar — working at an underconstruction Rose Bela tiles factory, were sleeping outside their hut. At 2.30am, when the girl’s mother woke up to attend nature’s call, she found her daughter missing. The girl’s parents started searching for her frantically. 
 
 On Thursday morning, the girl’s body was found floating in the farm pond, 1km from the factory. She was allegedly drowned by the assailant. 
 
 “As there are injury marks on her private parts and lips, rape is suspected. However, it will be confirmed after her postmortem report arrives. We have sent the girl’s body for forensic postmortem in Rajkot Civil Hospital,” Morbi taluka police station sub-inspector Shaktisinh Gohel said. 
 
 This case comes close on the heels of the rape of a four-year-old girl, the daughter of labourers, in Kuranga village, 32km from the temple town of Dwarka on April 24. 
 
 The rape survivor’s mother lodged a complaint in which she said her daughter was raped by an unidentified person at the labour colony of RSPL’s upcoming soda ash plant in Kuranga. Police have so far questioned over 1,000 suspects. However, identity of the key accused is yet to be ascertained.
