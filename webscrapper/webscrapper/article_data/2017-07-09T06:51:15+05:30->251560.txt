CHENNAI: Giving credit to the preventive mechanism of the state’s policing system, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday said crime rate had fallen in recent years. The state also fared much better when compared to other states in incidence of crime against women due to effective policing.

 During a debate on demand for grants for Home department, Palaniswami, armed with National Crime Records Bureau’s data, said a total of 1,511 cases of murder were registered in the state, as against 1,715 in 2010. Similarly, murder for gain cases dropped to 92 last year as against 153 in 2010, and robbery cases saw a fall of 7.5% from the DMK regime in 2010. The property crimes reported were 18,263 in 2015, whereas the number was far more in states like Maharashtra (87,329) and   (60,144) during the same period.
 
 “Generally, the crime rate is calculated by the   as the number of incidents per lakh of population. The property crimes stood at 26.4% in 2015, which is 14% less than the national rate,” the chief minister said, amid loud thumping of desks by the treasury benches. Haryana stands first with 104.7% followed by Maharashtra (73.3%) and Arunachal Pradesh (70.1%). Palaniswami said the state also had a record of detecting property crimes in the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 – topping the states in the country. 
 
 Pointing to the NCRB report, Palaniswami said the crimes against women -- rape, dowry death, molestation, sexual harassment, cruelty by husband and relatives and abduction of women -- also saw a drastic fall over the years. A total of 5,847 cases were registered in the state in 2015, while the number was far higher in Uttar Pradesh,  , Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. “Due to effective crime prevention measures, the data shows that crime against women is far less than the other states,” the CM said. 
 
 The state government, guided by the former CM J Jayalalithaa, accords top priority to women’s safety and extends adequate protection to women in crowded places, workplaces, educational institutions, commercial complexes and religious institutions. The state has also been closely monitoring the banned fundamental organizations and taking preventive measures to check terrorist activities. “Check posts are set up along state borders and there is strict surveillance in forests to monitor Naxal movement and to ensure there are no terror activities in Tamil Nadu,” the CM said.
