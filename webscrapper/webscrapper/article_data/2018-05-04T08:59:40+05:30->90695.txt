KOLKATA: MBBS aspirants have a reason to cheer this year as a   offering undergraduate courses has been sanctioned 150 seats.

 
 The medical college has been given the nod to admit students to the 150 seats this year by the   (MCI). Last year the college was not allowed to take in candidates after an MCI inspection found that there was a lack of infrastructure.
 
 “Though the college took the matter to the apex court, it was late for admissions even after a favourable judgment. As a result, many lost out on the opportunity to enrol for MBBS courses,” a college representative said. He added, “The college will admit 150 students this year. This will be for a period of five years and no inspection will be done in between.”
 
 Of the 150 seats, 50 will be for state domicile students from   and the rest will be allotted to the management quota.
 
 The MCI has also approved 50 permanent seats each in Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research and Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. “Till last year, each of the three colleges offered 150 seats for MBBS studies. But permission for admissions to 50 seats had to be renewed every year from MCI as they were ‘permitted’ seats. From this year, the three colleges will not be required to take yearly permission as all 150 seats have been made permanent. MCI conducts inspection for permanent seats only after five years,” a source said.
 
 A senior health department official said, “The number of medical seats in Bengal has increased manifold. At present, the 17 medical colleges in the state has around 2,400 seats. If 150 seats are added, the intake will rise up to 2,550 seats,” the health department source said.
