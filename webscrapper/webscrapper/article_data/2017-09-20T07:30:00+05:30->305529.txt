Chandigarh:   of Modern Housing Complex,  , on Tuesday joined the sanitation staff of the municipal corporation (MC) in cleaning the area spread over 66 acres in a special drive that saw them wielding brooms and guiding the workers to remove filth from pockets left uncovered.

 Modern Housing Complex Residents Welfare Association president Gursewak Singh said, “The initiative was aimed at getting every nook and corner cleaned. There are 3,000 houses in the complex. But the number of sanitation staff allotted is almost negligible. In the normal course, several areas do not get attention and are filled with garbage.”
 
 Members of the association and residents gathered at a common place and took an oath to keep their surroundings clean. At the same time, the sanitation teams also pledged to carry out the drive with sincerity.
 
 The teams were divided into four categories and given responsibilities to carry out the drive across the complex. Residents also made the teams clear muck from garages that have been unlocked for past many years.
 
 Association general secretary S A Qureshi said, “Many house owners have settled abroad and garages allotted to them are lying vacant that too without any gates. These garages have become a garbage dumping ground. Finally, they were cleaned The day was dedicated to specific areas around the complex which usually don’t get priority by sanitation teams.”
 
 Raman, a sanitation inspector, said, “The active participation of residents is welcome. The drive was a joint effort to help keep the area clean. Our teams will continue to work with the same zeal so that the area remains clean. People too should restrict themselves from littering.”
