CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has used the   model to impose a new   for raising funds for development.

 There is no clarity yet on how Punjab plans to collect Rs 200 per month development tax from income-tax payees engaged in “professions, trades, callings and employments.”
 
 Finance minister   said all the details will be clear once the state government will table a legislation on the issue.
 
 
 
 
 He proposed raising Rs 1,500 crore through additional resource mobilisation, including the new tax. But this still leaves an unfunded resource gap of Rs 4,175 crore. “I hope that with improved tax compliance and efficient delivery of public services, expenditure will be economised,” he said. The total   has been kept at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, though the effective budget size is Rs 1.02 lakh crore.
 
 “When this government took over, it was welcomed with an additional liability of Rs 30,584.11 crore in the form of loans to settle the so-called cash credit limit (CCL) legacy accounts,” Manpreet added. “The total   of the state as on March 31, 2018 is Rs 1,95,978 crore (1.95 lakh crore). This debt liability is likely to be Rs 2,11,523 crore (2.11lakh crore) in 2018-19, 40.82% of gross state domestic product (GSDP).”
 
 Although allocation for the farm debt waiver has been increased the fact remains that the state disbursed only Rs 370 crore of the Rs 1,500 crore allocated last year. The minister blamed commercial banks for the delay, saying that they had not given the required data.
 
 While the state has to deal with rising outstanding debt, Manpreet pointed out that the net borrowing limit fixed by the Centre for 2018-19 was Rs 15,545 crore. “We have consistently made efforts in the last year without either compromising on essential expenditure or putting excessive burden on citizens,” he said.
 
 He also talked of signs of improvement in financial affairs in line with the mantra of financial consolidation given by the 14th Finance Commission. “It gives me immense pleasure to say that as a result of fiscal prudence in the last year, the state could reduce days of overdraft from 179 in 2016-17 to 98 in 2017-18. Also, there was no double overdraft where it for 29 days in 2016-17,” he said.
 
 Besides, during 2017-18, GSDP has increased from Rs 4,33,660 crore last year to Rs 4, 77,482 crore now. I hope that in 2018-19, it would rise to Rs 5,18, 165 crore. The per capita income of the state has also gone up from Rs 1,31,112 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,42, 958 crore in 2017-18.
