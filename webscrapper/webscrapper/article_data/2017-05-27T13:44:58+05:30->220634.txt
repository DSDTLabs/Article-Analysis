Senior   leader   on Friday asserted he had no plans to join the   even as he once again rubbished reports that he was unhappy with the Congress, after the party’s pointsman in   Ashok Gehlot rushed to his residence, Vasant Vagdo, and held a meeting. Vaghela, who returned to   last night after a weeklong stay abroad, accused the BJP of spreading such rumours ahead of the state Assembly polls to be held later this year.
 
  The Congress leader was speaking at his residence at a joint press meet with Gehlot. Before the press meet, Gehlot held a meeting with Vaghela. While speculations were rife that the meeting was Gehlot’s attempt to pacify Vaghela, the Gujarat incharge called it a“routine meeting”.
  
  Vaghela claimed that several Congress MLAs were contacted by BJP, but not him. “Who told you that I am having any problem with Congress? Who told you that I am leaving the party and joining BJP? These are all rumours spread by BJP ahead of polls. Neither have I contacted any BJP leader nor have any of them contacted me till date,” the 77- year-old former Gujarat CM said.
  
  
 
  
  Asked about his meeting with former Gujarat incharge Gurudas Kamat, Vaghela replied, “About 34 MLAs came to my residence for the meeting as they had been contacted by the BJP. They came to tell Kamat of the harassment.” Vaghela also cleared his son Mahendrasinh was not joining BJP. He said his son went to Delhi recently not because he was summoned by party chief   but for official work regarding their institute. During the visit, he met   as “routine”.
  
  Meanwhile, briefing media, Gehlot said, “I was already scheduled to meet Bapu. As he reached the late, he invited me for lunch to his home. We discussed poll strategies. We have decided to fight with unity and regain power in the State after 22 years. I believe that Gujarat’s people have also decided to oust BJP this time in the public interest. We will make an environment for that.”
