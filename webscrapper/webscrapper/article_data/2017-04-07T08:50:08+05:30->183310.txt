NAGPUR:   dished out a vintage performance to storm into the men's singles quarterfinal of the Malaysia Open Super Series Premier Badminton tournament at Kuching, Sarawak, on Thursday.

 Unseeded Ajay registered a sterling come-from-behind victory against   of Denmark to book his place in the top eight. The last Indian hope after the early exit of PV Sindhu and  , Ajay floored fourth seed Axelsen 9-21, 21-14, 21-19 in 44 minutes.
 
 On his way to triumph at the India Open Super Series at New Delhi, Axelsen had ousted Ajay in the first round on last Wednesday. However, Ajay learnt from his last week loss and displayed a better tactical game to outfox his in-form opponent.
 
 In fact, Axelsen had a mixed day on Thursday. The giant Dane got good news when he reached his career-best world ranking of 2. 
 
 However, he could not celebrate that moment with a win as he lost a close outing against Ajay, world No. 20. With this win, the 29-year-old Ajay took a 3-2 lead in their head-to-head clashes.
 
 Ten points in succession by Axelsen in the first game after both were going almost equal at the beginning helped him pocket the opener quite easily.
 
 Second game saw a completely different Ajay on the court as he levelled the scores 1-1 by wrapping up the game with a clever display at the net.
 
 In the decider, there was hardly anything to choose between the two as both were on equal terms till the end. Axelsen saved one match point but Ajay clinched the issue in his favour on the second match point.
 
 "Definitely it feels good to have pulled through this time around. I lost narrowly against him last week. I won't label it as revenge though. I have always had good matches against him," Ajay told TOI from Malaysia.
 
 The Mumbai shuttler will now square off against fifth seed Son Wan Ho. The world No. 5 Korean enjoys a 3-0 head-to-head record against Ajay. However, they haven't met on the circuit since 2013.
