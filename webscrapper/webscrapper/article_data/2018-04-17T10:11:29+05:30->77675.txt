NEW DELHI: Buying   on Akshaya Tritiya is widely considered to be auspicious. Many view the event as a good opportunity to invest their money. However, in terms of buying gold as an investment, the scenario has undergone quite a change with the annual returns going down by more than half in the past 20 years. Over the last three years, gold has fetched a lower return of 4.68 per cent from 10.05 per cent earlier. 

 
 With the rising gold prices, the yellow metal is no longer considered a hedge against inflation along with the uptick in crude oil prices and global trade war pushing it further.
