ROHTAK: In the wake of a call by the All India   Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) to observe ‘black day’ on Sunday at its sit-ins across Haryana, the district administration has issued guidelines for the public to avoid any untoward incident.

 Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain said that they had set up nakas on every road connecting the city. He asked those plying vehicles to reach the Jassia sit-in on Sunday not to enter the city and take outer roads to reach the venue on the national highway 71-A. He appealed to the public not to take Rohtak-Panipat highway and asked them to travel via Kharkhodda or Lakhanmajra road to reach their destination. He said that elaborate arrangements had been made in the district and force had been deployed at sensitive and extra-sensitive points. 
 
 Meanwhile, members of the AIJASS were busy conducting meetings in villages to mobilise support for ‘black day’. The AIJASS Rohtak unit secretary,  , asked women to come wearing black headscarfs, elders to sport black turbans and youths to wear black bands to extend support.
