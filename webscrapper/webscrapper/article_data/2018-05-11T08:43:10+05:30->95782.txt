HYDERABAD: In order to improve local governance, the existing five Greater   (GHMC) zones have been split into six zones, the   standing committee on Thursday said after clearing the proposal.

 The existing ones, known as GHMC North, South, East, West and Central zone have been spilt into six zones now, and been named as LB Nagar zone, Charminar zone, Khairatabad zone, Secunderabad zone, Seriligamaplly zone and   zone.
  
  
 The new GHMC zones will require around 35 new posts each, including GHMC zonal commissioner and head of departments for town planning, urban biodiversity and maintenance.
 
 Mayor Bonthu Rammohan said that within three to four days, they will fill the posts and the zonal commissioner will also be decided shortly. According to GHMC commissioner  , work at the newly proposed zones of Khairatabad, Secunderabad, Seriligamaplly and Kukatpally will be implemented within a week.
 
 “The work will be completed within a week and the existing officials will be accommodated,” said B Janardhan Reddy.
 
 While no changes have been done to the East zone and South zone, changes have been made to Central zone, West zone and North zone. The new zonal system have been created for the convenience of people, said GHMC officials.
 
 “The new system will ensure that people need not travel long distances to visit the zonal office for their administration work,” said J Shankaraiah, GHMC additional commissioner (administration).
