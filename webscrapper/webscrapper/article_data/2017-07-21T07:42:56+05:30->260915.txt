LUCKNOW: KGMU’s   was constructed and has been functioning without a   ( ) from the fire department, the university admitted on Thursday. It has, however, passed the buck to the state construction agency, which, in turn, passed it to the   even as services at the centre resume after a fire on Saturday. 

 It is required by law for high-rise buildings to obtain NOC from the fire department on two occasions—before construction begins and when the building begins to be used. In a preliminary report to the divisional commissioner,   could present only a fire survey certificate issued in August 2006. 
 
 KGMU officials accepted that UP Nirman Nigam, the executing agency, had not been able to produce NOC from the fire department for KGMU.
 
 According to present CFO AB Pandey, “The certificate was issued to KGMU 11 years ago, when it was a single-storey building. Over the years, its capacity has expanded and it outgrew the efficacy of the fire-fighting system. The university should have presented the notice from the fire department in August 2016 when its fire-fighting system failed parameters. There was a reminder for the same in June.” 
 
 An official from Nirman Nigam said, “During initial stages of construction, Trauma Centre was not under by-laws for obtaining a fire NOC.”
