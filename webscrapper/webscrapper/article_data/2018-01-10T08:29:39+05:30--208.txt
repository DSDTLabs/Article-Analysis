JHANSI: Special   court judge  , who recently convicted   president   in a fodder scam case and awarded him a three-and-half years' jail term, is himself facing problems in getting his ancestral land back in his native village in Jalaun district of UP. 

 Judge Singh has ancestral land in village Shekhpur Khurd of Jalaun district. His younger brother Surendra Pal Singh says that the previous   got a 'chak road' marked on their ancestral land because of his vested interest. 
 
 The said land falls under   number 15 and 17 whereas the road should have passed through Gatta number 13, claims Singh.
 
 As a result, the private land of special CBI court judge is being used as public road by the villagers. 
 
 Surendra Pal further says that despite repeated requests and complaints to higher authorities no action has been taken till now to restore their land back to them. Even judge Shivpal Singh himself met authorities a few times but no action has been taken, he says.
 
 When TOI inquired about the case with Jalaun DM, Mannan Akhtar, he said, "It is a long pending matter. For many years, the villagers are using the said land as road. Few days ago, I had sent the SDM and Deputy SP to settle the issue. Today, the team has again gone to enquire and measure the said 'chak road'. As per the rules of revenue act, we are only authorized to measure revenue land. We need a court order to measure any individual's land. We hope that some solution will be found out soon and the issue will be resolved."
