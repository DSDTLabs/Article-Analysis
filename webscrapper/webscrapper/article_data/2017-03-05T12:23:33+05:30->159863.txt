 "In today's day and age, social interaction is colossal. For me who is a   person as I am there on Facebook, Instagram, twitter it gets difficult to reply to everybody. So if I have them all in one place then it is easier for fans and for me to talk, its great source of communication," she says.
 
 Celebrities have often been at the receiving end for their posts and subjected to trolling, but Amy thinks that it is a part and parcel of being there on social media platforms. 
 
 "I think there are pros and cons of everything. The beauty of social media as we have the platform to reach out to millions of people so easily. But it is also easy for the trolls to sit there behind the keyboard and have an opinion. But that's the way it is. One has to be thick skinned in this industry and in this day and age," she says. 
 
 On work front, she will be seen alongside south superstar   and   in '2.0'. The upcoming science fiction film directed by S Shankar is set to release on October 18 this year.
