UNNAO: The police complaint of the   rape survivor’s mother which was turned into an FIR on Thursday accuses a woman of luring her to the crime spot and keeping a vigil outside the verandah of BJP   Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s place during the assault.

 In her complaint, the mother accuses one Shashi Singh, a resident of Makhi village, of having lured her minor daughter to Sengar’s place where he raped her. “When my daughter resisted, MLA   thrashed her. Threatening her, he said that if she opens her mouth he would get her entire family killed,” the mother wrote in her complaint.
 
 The survivor’s mother has mentioned that the rape took place at 8pm on June 4, 2017. She added that born on August 17, 2002, her daughter is a minor and had completed her basic education from  .
 
 “When my daughter reached home (on June 4), she narrated the entire incident. My daughter and our family members gave several complaints but the case was not registered,” the mother wrote in the complaint. “I, therefore, request that an FIR be registered for rape and also against the woman Shashi who hatched the conspiracy and necessary legal action be taken,” she further says.
 
 The survivor’s uncle said the FIR was lodged only after media pressure. “No one was listening to us. We ran from pillar to post but no one helped. Now, Sengar should be arrested immediately. Till he is roaming free, he poses a threat to our lives,” he added.
 
 The survivor’s elder sister said the MLA and his brother Atul are ‘goons’ because of which no one in Unnao has the courage to speak against them. “If anyone speaks against them, they get the person eliminated. Police always worked under their pressure and sided with them always. Had he been a common man, police would have arrested him and put him in jail,” she added.
