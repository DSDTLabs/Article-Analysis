BHUBANESWAR/BALASORE: Communal tension erupted at   town on Thursday after a person posted derogatory remarks about some Hindu deities on Facebook. Police detained the man following protests by   and   supporters, who blocked roads at different places by burning tyres. 

 The district administration imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC after the agitators of one community allegedly attacked some shops, owned by people of another community. 
 
 "We detained the man, who reportedly made the Facebook post. We are verifying whether or not he posted the offensive remarks. It might have been a mischief by someone by creating a fake Facebook account," said a police officer. 
 
 Police said the protesters of one community attempted to torch a few shops owned by the another community. "Though the damage in the shops was not severe, we prevented escalation of the situation. Adequate police forces were mobilised and patrolling was intensified," SP (Bhadrak)   said.
