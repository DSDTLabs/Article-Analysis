BENGALURU: The fast and furious   has a theatrical side to him, one which he showcased against skipper   and a monk-like Matt Renshaw on Sunday. On a day of intense cricket, Ishant provided comical relief especially after the stares exchanged by R Ashwin and David Warner had generated some heat earlier. 

 First, he had skipper   in splits after he mimicked Smith, whose response didn't have the same effect as that of Ishant or rather bar ring one occasion, he was rather tame. The next in line for the pacer was Renshaw, who returned the gesture with just a few angelic smiles. Renshaw took some heat from Ashwin as well for obstructing the bowler, while Kohli made some polite enquiries about the state of his stomach which was a cause of a lot of rumble in Pune. Kohli even urged the fans to up the decibel level and join the party.
 
 Speaking about his exchange with Kohli, the Australian opener said, “He (Kohli) was just saying that I might need to run off and go to the toilet again, which happened in Pune. It was quite funny. It was really loud out there when he was doing that (urging the crowd on). It's something I'm probably not used to but it's about embracing different conditions and different challenges that we get. I was just trying to enjoy it and trying to laugh.”
 
 Renshaw may have cut his teeth in international cricket barely four months ago, but he's a quick learner and knows a thing or two about handling verbal duels on field. “I try not to say too much out there. I just try and smile because my past experiences say that smiling seems to unnerve the bowlers a bit more than talking.”
