LUCKNOW: Recovery of an electric generated jelly bomb from a house in   had the residents rushing out in panic on Saturday afternoon. They later stayed put in a park where sleuths of   (ATS) diffused the low-intensity bomb successfully.

 Police inspector, Indira Nagar, Deepak Kushwaha said an unknown person played a prank on   and Rahul who stay on rent in sector 9. The house is owned by   who lives in   but is in Pune right now. Around 3 pm on Saturday, Nishant returned from Holi vacation and found the parcel at his doorstep. It was heavy and out of curiosity, he opened it to find wires inside. Nishant panicked and called police. Later, the police team informed the ATS. Initial finding revealed that the parcel carried a plastic box from which some wire protruded. There were six small devices of the size of a match box each and a plug was attached. The other end of the plug was connected with a match box which carried explosives. There was a jelly-like substance between the explosives and the wire and a match stick was placed over the jelly.
 
 Indira Nagar SHO said the explosive was taken to Scientists Forensic Science Lab (FSL) in Lucknow. The scientists found that the bomb-like device could cause fire if connected with power supply. It, however, will not explode on its own as the explosives were not of that kind,” he said, while sharing the findings of the FSL.
 
 The SHO said Nishant got a similar kind of parcel filled with lime ten days ago. “Either someone is playing pranks on him or genuinely wants to hurt Nishant,” he said.
 
 Nishant’s complaint against unknown persons has been registered and a probe is underway. He works with a courier agency and also contributes for a magazine. His friend Rahul is a medical representative.
