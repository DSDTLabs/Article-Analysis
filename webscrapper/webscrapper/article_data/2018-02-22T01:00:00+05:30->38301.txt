This time, it was for a Bollywood night that these party animals decided to head to. They all turned up with their gang of friends and posed for the shutterbugs before getting themselves busy with the party hungama.   Music, as expected, was heavy with pulsating rhythm and many of them went straight to the dance floor. Others found themselves comfortable corners in the room and settled down with their food and drinks. Being a fun hangout, most of them were dressed down in tank tops and ripped jeans, yet those like Akila and Divya nailed the cas look.
