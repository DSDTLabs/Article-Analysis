MUMBAI: Bollywood film producer  's   was hacked by an unknown fraudster, who sent requests to friends and members of the film industry to transfer money to "his  " to raise funds for a show in Lucknow. Kapoor, who is abroad for a film shoot, was alerted of the hack on March 3 after concerned friends called him. 

 When TOI contacted Kapoor, he said that he will return to the city on Friday and “take charge of the situation”. A member of his staff, Sunil Malhotra, has filed a complaint with the   police in Bandra Kurla Complex on his behalf. “Kapoor's Twitter account has been inactive since September 2015,” said the cyber police officer.
 
 According to the FIR, after hacking Kapoor's account on March 3, the imposter sent tweets to members of the film industry and media persons, requesting that Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000 be transferred to his Paytm account. “The imposter even shared a contact number, which is now switched off, to make the money transfer. When those receiving the messages enquired the reason for it, they were told that it was for a show in Lucknow,” said a police officer.
