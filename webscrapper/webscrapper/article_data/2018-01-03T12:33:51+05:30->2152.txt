NAGPUR: With a view to pay tributes to Dr  , MLC   has demanded naming of   after him. He even moved a proposal in this regard in the legislative council during recently concluded winter assembly session. The upper house unanimously cleared it.

 “It was then sent to the Centre for routing it to the railways. Only after latter’s nod renaming could be done. I have been raising this proposal with the government since a long time,” NCP legislator from city told TOI.
 
 He stated since railways came under the Central government, the house decided to route the proposal through them. “Similar method was adopted when Victoria Terminus (VT) in Mumbai was named after Shivaji Maharaj. The proposal was moved by state transport minister   when he was in the opposition,” he said.
 
 Explaining his demand, the former corporator from VNIT ward said the father of Indian Constitution had lived for many years in place named Rajgruh in Hindu Colony in Dadar. “This place has already been declared national heritage. Many relics are still kept there for visitors. Lakhs of Dr Ambedkar’s followers throng Chaitya Bhoomi every year on the occasion of his birth anniversary and Mahaparinirvan Din. This place is also located in Dadar,” Gajbhiye said.
 
 He stated an international level memorial was coming up at Chaitya Bhoomi and it would be a fitting tribute to rename the railway station after him. City’s   airport is already been named after Dr Ambedkar.
