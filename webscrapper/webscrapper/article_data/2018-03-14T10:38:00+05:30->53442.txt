CHENNAI: The 18,000-odd   schools should follow only the   prescribed subjects and no additional subjects should be included in the curriculum, the   has said. 

 
 "It is not known when the NCERT has prescribed only limited subjects to young children, how the CBSE allows its affiliated schools to have more subjects for the students," Justice   wondered while hearing a plea moved by advocate M Purushothaman.
 
 According to the petitioner, the NCERT syllabus prescribed only three subjects for Class I under CBSE - mother tongue, English and mathematics. But in reality, the Class I children are forced to study eight subjects, including computer science, general knowledge and Hindi.
 
 This apart, NCERT has specifically stated that schools should not give homework to children of Class I and II. But, in reality, these rules are flouted and homework is made compulsory not only in CBSE but also in state boards, he added. When the plea came up for hearing, the CBSE submitted that it would ensure strict compliance of such NCERT circulars.
 
 Recording the submission, Justice   insisted that the board had a mechanism to make inspections and verify whether schools are following NCERT syllabus. To this the board said they had no financial assistance to implement the Acts enacted by the central and state governments. The judge directed the assistant solicitor general to get instructions from the central government and inform the court by March 27.
