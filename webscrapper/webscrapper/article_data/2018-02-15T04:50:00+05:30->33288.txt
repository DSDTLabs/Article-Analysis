NEW DELHI: The Centre has called a two-day national conference on February 19-20 to discuss farm distress and find a permanent solution. Prime Minister   will attend the valedictory round on the second day and review the suggestions emerging from the brainstorming. 

 The conference will be inaugurated by agriculture minister Radha   at the Pusa complex. In April, the ministry will call a meeting of state agriculture ministers to discuss, among other issues, strengthening the procurement mechanism. Senior officials of  , farm price advisory body CACP, state universities, farmers and farmers’ bodies will attend the meeting next week. 
 
 On the first day, farm experts and officials will brainstorm on issues confronting farmers as well as the agriculture sector. They will submit their recommendations before the PM the next day. Poll-bound   and Rajasthan have already announced sops to help farmers. 
 
 The central government, in the 2018-19 budget, has announced fixing of minimum support price (MSP) for 23 crops at 50% over the cost of production. The price deficiency scheme of Madhya Pradesh and the cash transfer scheme of Telangana will also be discussed in the meeting. 
 
 Under MP’s ‘Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana’, the state pays farmers the difference between the MSP for crops and their average market rate. Farmers get money if they have to sell their produce in the open market below the MSP. Telangana has taken a different approach to support farmers. 
 
 The state will disburse Rs 4,000 per acre twice a year (Kharif and Rabi) to cover the cost of major inputs (fertilisers, seeds and pesticides). Disbursement will start from the Kharif season this year (May). It will cost Rs 12,000 crore per year to the state exchequer.
