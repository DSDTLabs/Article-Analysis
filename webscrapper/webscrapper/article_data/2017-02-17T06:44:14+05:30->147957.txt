INDORE: The   of   rejected the   filed by  , who is accused of the murder of Mhow   and for attempting to kill Garg’s associate Jai Singh Thakur. The transfer petitions were moved by Thakur on grounds that his safety was under threat during the trial and there was extreme pressure from the local bar association in Mhow, where the two trials are being held.

 The transfer of the cases was sought to any other court of neighboring district. Thakur’s counsel argued that even the relatives of the deceased lawyer did not visit the court as they were scared of the other lawyers and their aggression.
 
 Countering the arguments, additional advocate general Sunil Jail, argued that Thakur is being fairly represented in court by advocates and that he has not expressed any fear of a threat to his life from the family of the deceased. The state also argued that since the offence had been committed in Mhow, the trial should be conducted at the Mhow’s sessions court itself. Arguments against the transfer of the trial were also supported by objector Ravindra Chhabra, who sought the dismissal of the petitions.
 
 Based on these arguments, the court noted that non availability of a congenial atmosphere cannot be a ground for transfer. “Mere apprehension is not enough,” the court noted.
 
 The two trials against Mangilal Thakur and three other accused are pending before the 2nd additional sessions judge in Mhow. The first trial is being held regarding the murder of Mhow based lawyer Yogesh Garg, who died on November 15, 2015.
 
 The second trial is being conducted regarding the alleged attack on Garg’s associate on March 29, 2013, in which Thakur’s car was hit by a dumper, and instead of causing his death, lead to the death of two other motor cycle riders. Both Yogesh Garg and Jai Singh Thakur were practicing advocates at Mhow court.
