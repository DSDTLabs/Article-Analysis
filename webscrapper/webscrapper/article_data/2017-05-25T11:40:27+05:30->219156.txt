Now that wedding bells can almost be heard for the   union, there was a buzz that   would be taking a three-month break to get into the wedding mode and ensure everything is in place for the D-Day. 

 However, these are just rumours because Sam is in no hurry to take a break from her acting commitments. Right now, the pretty actress has her hands full, till June, with   61, post which she will be shooting for two films with Sivakarthikeyan , and Ram Charan simultaneously.
 
 So, for the October wedding in the works, Sam, it is now being learnt, will take a break only from October 1 and it will be only a 10-day-long break. Now thatâ€™s professionalism for you!
