CUTTACK: Come elections and one can see a spike in the demand of jeeps. At the ongoing  , the open-top jeeps have become first choice for candidates on the campaign trail and vehicle owners too are cashing in on the opportunity. 

 Politicians and their supporters   with folded hands is a common sight these days. Politicians claim the jeep not only helps them in covering long distance and difficult terrain, but also help them connect with the voters. 
 
 "One can easily campaign riding an open-top jeep. We can interact with voters by waving more easily," said  , a candidate.
 
 Jeeps are not much in demand for tours and travels so agencies and individuals who own these vehicles try to reap the benefits during poll season.
 
 "I own three jeeps and all my vehicles are booked till February 21. I lend my vehicles for film shootings also, but I must say elections are my favourite time," said Rahim, a vehicle owner. He charges between Rs 4000 to Rs 7000 a day for his jeeps.
 
 According to vehicle owners, there are about 25 such   in Cuttack and owners are doing brisk business during election time. 
 
 "I have remodelled my grandfather's jeep and it pays me good returns in election season," said  , another vehicle owner. Das had earned over Rs 1 lakh during the 2014 general elections. Apart from Cuttack district, candidates from Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Jajpur are also coming down here to book jeeps.
