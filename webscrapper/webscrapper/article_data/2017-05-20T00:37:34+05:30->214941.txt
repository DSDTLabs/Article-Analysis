MUMBAI: Students across affiliated colleges have written to Mumbai University vice-chancellor about the problems plaguing the system that is affecting their careers. 

 From the “excessive” stress put by the credit system to the delayed revaluation result, from the unavailability of textbooks with revised syllabi to the faulty degree certificates, students said that sudden changes must be stopped and there should be no reduction is marks set aside for practical tests. The Bombay University   Teachers Union has submitted the students’ plea to VC Sanjay Deshmukh. “The university revises its syllabus and exam pattern for our streams but the changed syllabus, examination pattern and textbooks were not made known till mid-semester,” students said. 
 
 Students also said that their hall tickets were made available a day before the exam. “Many of us received our hall tickets with mistakes in names, subjects or photos or wrong Devnagari translation. Dates of exams given on some hall tickets were not matching with the university’s time table,” said a student.
 
 Delayed declaration of result, some students claimed, led to loss of opportunity in terms of jobs and dates for applying to other universities for further education.
