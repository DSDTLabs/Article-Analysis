PUNE: Three motorcycles, including an imported bike, were gutted by fire caused by the   at an open public parking space on Ghole Road on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Police said the fire first broke out in the imported bike and then spread to the two motorcycles parked on its two sides. No one was injured in the incident.
 
 Deccan Gymkhana police officers and a few witnesses said the fire broke out around 1.45pm. “Within a few minutes, I saw the motorcycles go up in flames. The bikes were completely gutted,” said  , who works as a watchman in a neighbouring building. 
 
 “As of now, we have found nothing suspicious in the case. Some eyewitnesses told the police that the flames started from the bike parked in between two other motorcycles. Nobody ignited the fire,” Deccan Gymkhana police senior inspector Ajay Kadam told TOI. 
 
 Investigation officer R R   said Vivek Ganpat Dandge of Koregaon Park, who owned one of the motorcycles, has recorded his statement to the police. “Dandge is a fitness science student. He had parked his motorcycle on the road and had gone upstairs to attend classes in a private institute. On hearing some noises around 1.45 pm, he came down and saw his motorcycle burning,” Maine said.
 
 Owners of the remaining two motorcycles, including the one who owns the imported bike, were yet to approach the police. “We waited throughout the day, but they didn’t turn up at the police station,” Maine said.
 
 “The motorcycles motorcycles were parked directly under the Sun. It appears prima facie that the fire broke out because of the excessive heat. We will, however, collect and examine footage of CCTV cameras from the neighbouring buildings. It will clear all doubts,” the officer added.
 
 On Tuesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 38.1ºC.
