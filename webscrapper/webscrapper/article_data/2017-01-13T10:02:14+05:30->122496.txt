CHENNAI: After a tweet last week by a 34-year-old man from Odisha that his employer in   was "torturing" him, a Chennai recruitment agency has initiated contact with the employer. Resource Hunters private limited senior official Jayaraman confirmed that   was sent by the agency to work at Jeddah-based construction firm TCW. 

 Seeking the attention of external affairs minister  , Swain (@parameswarswa10) tweeted on January 5, "Dear madam please help me! Am in Saudi Arabia. Company owner torchor (torture) me." Swain, who works as a storekeeper, claimed that his employers at TCW attacked him. He posted a picture of himself showing what appeared to be a hand injury.
 
 Jayaraman of Resource Hunters said, "A man fitting the description of the person who has tweeted indeed was sent to   by our agency. We have initiated contact with the Saudi employer TCW to verify the claims made in the tweet."
 
 Swain, a native of Tihada village in   district of Orissa, sent a series of tweets to Swaraj and the PMO since December 24 narrating his ordeal. On Wednesday, Swain's wife, Aparajita, who has approached the state government for help, told TOI, "My husband stays with some Pakistani nationals. He has not been able to get their support. The company has been paying much less than what was promised. He has not received his salary for several months."
