The entire unit of the 'Baahubali' team gets "letter of appreciation" and a "tee-shirt signed by the important cast and crew" at the valedictory bash. The makers of the movie released numerous photographs which they named "the BIG   family" and not to mention, they took the social media by storm. The unit called it a wrap for shooting of 'Baahubali: The Conclusion" after a day when director S S Rajamouli announced that actor Prabhas has completed shooting his part for it. The letter of appreciation was something to mention in this context, which has a great inspirational saying by writer Paulo Coelho at the beginning and is concluded with "We dreamed, we pursued, we achieved". One of the producers, Shobu Yarlagadda on his social network handle posted a few pictures of the letters and the tee-shirt, and wrote, "It's DONE. We wrapped up shoot of the magnum opus BAAHUBALI. #Baahubali2, (Sic)."Now, it is finally time to look forward for some interesting teasers and trailers for the unit.
