AHMEDABAD: There is good new for those seeking admission to postgraduate courses at government medical colleges in the state. Gujarat will see a record a increase, 400-odd, in the number of PG medical seats. 

 The state government accepted the notification of the   (MCI) which raised the intake capacity of PG students per professor and associate professor.
 
 MCI notification says a professor will now be allotted three PG seats against two earlier. Similarly, an associate professor will be allotted two PG seats instead of one earlier. 
 
 Sources in the health department said it will implement this from the next academic year, beginning April 2017-18.
 
 Gujarat currently has 1,500 PG medical seats, of which 1,300 are at government medical colleges. The state get at least 400 seats more, even with the 30% vacancies in medical teachers.
 
 It needs mention that seven self financed medical colleges run by the state-controlled Gujarat Medical Education and Research Society (GMERS) and other self-financed colleges like NHL Municipal Medical College will not get more PG seats.
 
 Experts say the development will benefit not only medical students but also the state, which will get more specialist doctors to serve the people. Currently, PG medical seats in clinical branches at private colleges command hefty capitation fees ranging from Rs 50 lakh to 1 crore. This is over and above the annual college fees. 
 
 “This is a positive decision as more PG seats will be mean more specialist doctors to serve the people of the state. At   itself, there will be a benefit of 50-odd seats by this decision,” said Dr  , dean of medical faculty of Gujarat University.
 
 MCI asked has government colleges to send details of all professors and associate professors to compute the exact increase in PG seats.
