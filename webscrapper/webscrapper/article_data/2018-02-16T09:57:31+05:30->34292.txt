BHUBANESWAR: The   has termed Wednesday's meeting between   and   as an attempt by the   to confuse the voters ahead of the February 24 Bijepur byelection. 

 Speaking to reporters here, BJP state vice-president Sameer Mohanty said, "Naveen is trying to confuse the voters. But such a tactic won't work. Our party president Amit Shah has given a clarion call to party cadres that our fight is against the Naveen dispensation here." 
 
 Though Naveen has termed the meeting a 'courtesy call,' it has given rise to speculation of changing political equation between the the BJP and the BJD, who had been alliance partners from 2000 to 2009.
 
 Naveen's meeting with Modi comes amid growing acrimony between the BJD and the BJP, and close on the heels of the attack on the house of V K Pandian, the chief minister's private secretary.
 
 Amareswar Mishra, a retired professor of political science at Utkal University, said there doesn't seem to be a political reason behind the meeting. "A CM meeting the PM can be for several reasons like better funding for the state or to push for a particular policy initiative. But the timing of the meeting does confuse people," he observed.
 
 BJD spokesperson Amar Prasad Sapathy said when the CM has said it was just a courtesy call the matter should end there.
 
 In another development, the chief minister met leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra at his Delhi residence on Thursday. "I had come to Delhi at the state government's invite. The CM has sought the opposition's cooperation in hosting the upcoming men's hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar. There is nothing political about the meeting," Narasingha said.
 
 Echoing similar views, BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb said leaders from the opposition parties too were invited for the sports event.
