For offline mode, they can generate challans at BBMP ward offices and at all Canara Bank, HDFC, Axis and ICICI branches in the city. Unlike last year, this time there are no technical glitches in the tax payment software or at other levels. So, there will be no extension of the rebate deadline.”
 
 Venkatachalapathy called upon taxpayers to make use of the online payment mode as the software has been upgraded to facilitate smoother access. “Also, there won’t be transaction charges for online payments if the tax amount is within Rs 5,000,” he added.
 
 Officials at the civic body said they have held meetings with bank officials to set up separate counters at their branches to process property tax payments.
 
 Asked about possible staff shortage at BBMP ward offices, given that most of them would be on poll duty for more than a month, officials said election-related work will be done at ward offices itself and the staffers have been told to manage both.
