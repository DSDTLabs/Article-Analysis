ALAPPUZHA: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the accident that led to the death of   Pillai, a petitioner in the   fake encounter case, took three truck drivers into custody on Saturday for questioning.

 They were quizzed by a police team led by district police chief  . “We do not suspect any foul play,” he said but added that investigations were on.
 
 “When we checked the CCTV visuals of a petrol bunk 400km away from the accident spot, we saw three trucks, including an oil tanker, behind Gopinath’s car. The visuals helped us to identify the trucks and their drivers. We called them to the police station. None of them conceded that their vehicle hit the car from behind. So, we are looking forward to forensic and scientific experts to confirm whether any of these trucks rearended the car,” Pattanakad sub-inspector B Shajimon.
 
 DSP AG Lal said the police focus was on the oil tanker. But he said the police were yet to confirm whether it hit the car.
 
 Gopinatha Pillai, 78, whose son   was killed in an alleged fake encounter by Gujarat police in 2004, died on Friday following a road accident.
 
 Pillai, a native of Nooranad, who was engaged in a legal fight to prove the innocence of his son branded as a terrorist, met with the accident at around 6am on Wednesday at   on National Highway 66 here while on his way to private hospital in Kochi for a medical check-up. The Maruti 800 car was being driven by his brother Madhavan Pillai.
 
 “A car that was moving in front of us suddenly applied brake. I slowed down the car and it was rear-ended by a truck. I lost control of the vehicle, which crossed the median and collided with another truck coming from the opposite direction. The lorry which rear-ended our car, however, did not stop,” Madhavan Pillai had said after the accident.
 
 The cremation of Gopinath Pillai was held on his house premises at Nooranad on Saturday.
