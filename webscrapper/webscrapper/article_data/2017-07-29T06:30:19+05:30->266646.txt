KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Friday asked CBI to explain how the authenticity of the Narada tapes could be corroborated in absence of the original device, prompting the central agency to seek expert opinion on the matter. 

 Present at the court of Justice Joymalya Bagchi on Friday, Trinamool MP Aparupa Poddar’s lawyer   alleged that Narada News boss   had reformatted the laptop before handing it over to the investigating agencies. In its course, all the “metadata were erased”, he alleged. 
 
 “The metadata could have shown how the data or files originated or were transferred,” Luthra said.
 
 The CFSL report had earlier pointed out that there was no tampering of the footage but Luthra challenged that the footage the agency examined was not from the original device. “There has been a lack of clarity on part of Mathew Samuel,” he said. 
 
 Appearing for another petitioner Iqbal Ahmed, deputy mayor of Kolkata Corporation, advocate Amit Desai alleged that Samuel was politically motivated when he conducted the sting operation. He has also pointed out of the date of the sting operation coinciding with the election. The next date of hearing has been fixed on August 4.
