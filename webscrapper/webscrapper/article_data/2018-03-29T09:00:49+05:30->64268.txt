CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly moved a breach of privilege motion against AAP’s leader of opposition   for using inappropriate words while making allegations against   MLAs over the issue of illegal mining. Parliamentary affairs minister   said while   had retracted statements on November 29, 2017, he had again used the same objectionable words on Monday.

 “I have gone through the record. He was speaking on the governor’s address and made false and irresponsible allegations. The matter should be referred to the privilege committee,” he said.
 
 Khaira had claimed that most of the Congress MLAs were involved in illegal mining.
