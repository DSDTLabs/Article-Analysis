NOIDA: Five minors were apprehended for allegedly gang-raping a 14-year-old girl in a village in Sector 51. The accused filmed the entire incident and threatened to put the video on social media if the girl reported the matter, said police. 

 The incident was reported on Tuesday, two days after the girl was allegedly gang raped. She said the accused had been stalking her for few months.
 
 "I had gone to a local grocery store on Sunday evening and while returning, one of the boys, who is 13, took me to his home. Four other boys were hiding there. They immediately overpowered me. One of them removed his clothes and started raping me while other four stood guard," the survivor told the police.
 
 "I cried for help and some people from outside responded. The boys felt they would be caught. I managed to flee from there and reached home," she added. Her family members have also alleged the police did not file an FIR initially.
 
 However, Bijendra Singh Bhadana, SHO, Sector 49 police station, claimed the family members of victims and accused were trying to settle the matter initially. "The girl's father reported the matter to police on Tuesday, and all five boys were arrested," Bhadana said.
 
 Four of the five juveniles are related and live together. The fifth accused lives as a tenant in their home.
 
 The 13-year old accused claimed the girl had asked him to fix a meeting with one of the boys. "I just accompanied her to the house. Some more boys were there. She was taken to the washroom. I was outside, and I did not do anything," he told police. 
 
 After the FIR was filed, the victim was taken to the district hospital for medical examination and the report is awaited.
