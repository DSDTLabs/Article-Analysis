PUNE: Following the State Election Commission’s (SEC) directions,   has urged all colleges in the district to distribute form 6 or   along with the   forms for both junior and senior college admissions.

 A special drive will be held in July during admissions. In Maharashtra, the age group of 18-21 years is represented by only 33% of the state’s voters, stated officials from the department. The aim is to raise the number of the first time voters to nearly 80%, an official said. 
 
 The students at the entry level of junior colleges will have to declare that they will complete the enrolment process on turning 18 years. 
 
 Chandrakar said they will also mark District Voters Day on July 23, and for the entire month voters can check their names in the voters list at the respective electoral registration offices. 
 
 The SEC had earlier appointed students and principals as nodal officers to reach out to students, however the response was not encouraging. With the new order, it expects colleges to put in extra efforts and encourage students.
 
 Once the forms are submitted to the college, the principal will ensure that the forms are handed over to the election department at the collectorate. The department will also ensure that the necessary entries are made for including the names online. 
 
 Chandrakant Rawal, principal, Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said they will wait for instructions on whether the forms have to be distributed to all students or only to those whose admissions are confirmed.
