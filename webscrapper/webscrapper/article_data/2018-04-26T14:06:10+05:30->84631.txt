NAGPUR: The   conducted its second   on Wednesday, which was also the city’s second   transplant. The first transplant was performed on Sunday.

 A 48-year-old male patient was declared dead early in the morning. The counsellor from Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee ( ) convinced the family to donate the organs. The family agreed but wanted the body early for funeral. So, besides the kidneys and liver, no other organs were donated.
 
 As per the ZTCC waiting list one kidney went to Wockhardt Hospital, and the other went to Orange City Hospital and Research Institute. New Era Hospital was the first hospital in city to get the license for liver transplants from the state government in February this year. Hence, it also has patients in its waiting list first.
 
 The hospital, however, didn’t declare anything about the liver transplant on Wednesday as it is holding a press meet on Thursday, probably to announce the same. Dr Vibhawari Dani, ZTCC president, told TOI that it was right on the part of the hospital to share information with media only after the transplant is over. Hence, ZTCC too didn’t announce the transplant officially on Wednesday.
