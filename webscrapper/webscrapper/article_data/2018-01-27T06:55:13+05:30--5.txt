HYDERABAD: Stating that the country was celebrating the current Republic Day in uncertain times, Acting Chief Justice   of the   on Friday told the judges and the legal fraternity about Justice Bijon Kumar Mukherjee, the fourth Chief Justice of India (CJI), who declined to be sworn in as CJI out of turn despite being offered the post by none other than the then Prime Minister   in January 1954. This incident took place just days before the retirement of then CJI Justice Patanjali Sastry on January 3, 1954.

It was only after Justice Mahajan’s assent and retirement as CJI that Justice Mukherjee took over as 4th CJI, Justice   said after unfurling the tricolour at the Republic Day celebrations in the Hyderabad High Court premises. “Let us draw inspiration from and try to emulate judges like Justice Mukherjee who placed the interest of the institution far above his own,” the Acting CJ said.

 Though he did not name any individual or current instances in his speech, Justice Ramesh’s words assume significance in view of the ongoing tussle among the top five judges of the Supreme Court, several lawyers who heard his speech said.
