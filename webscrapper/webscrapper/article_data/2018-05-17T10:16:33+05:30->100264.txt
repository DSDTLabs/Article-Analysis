KENDRAPARA: A 35-year-old bridge over the   in   village of   district is on the verge of collapse. That, however, has not stopped people from risking their lives and using it. 

 Not just people, buses, overladen trucks and other heavy vehicles take the 458-meter-long bridge every day, imperilling it further. "Concrete slabs are missing in six places on the bridge. It has been like that since last year. Some parapets of the bridge caved in two years ago but the officials are yet to make any repairs," said  , a resident of Alipingal.
 
 Saroj Nayak of Alipingal said passengers had no alternative but to use the bridge to cross the river. "Due to substandard construction and lack of proper maintenance, the bridge is now in a dilapidated state. Iron rods inside the concrete slabs are protruding out from the top of the bridge. The exposed rods themselves pose a threat to the motorists," he explained.
 
 "While cracks have developed on the pillars of the bridge, the authorities refuse to admit that plying of heavy vehicles can cause further damage," said Maheswar Behera of Alipingal.
 
 A large number of villagers of Alipingal, Sithalo, Eakbarua, Saradaelo, Raniola, Barisana, Kasadra and other gram panchayats depend on the bridge, built in the 1980s, to cross the Devi.
 
 When contacted, the assistant engineer (roads and buildings), Jagatsinghpur division,  , said, "The bridge was designed for light vehicles only. Now, the bridge has become unsafe for commuters due to the plying of heavy vehicles, especially sand-laden dumpers and trucks. The bridge trembles every time heavy vehicles move on it. We have asked the district administration to stop heavy vehicles from plying the bridge. We have also recently started repairs on it."
