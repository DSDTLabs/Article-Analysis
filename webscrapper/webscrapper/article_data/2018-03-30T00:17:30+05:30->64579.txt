New Delhi: The   has informed the Delhi   that all   kept at the city race club are now free of the fatal   disease.

 However, the government added that at present no equestrian event can be held in the capital since a notification barring such activity is in force.
 
 The government reply came before Justice Rajiv Shakdher who had last month asked the government to test serum samples of all the 422 horses stabled at the   to find out if any of them were suffering from Glanders. HC had at the same time made it clear that no horse races would be held at the club till further orders.
 
 Following the directions, the government assured court that all serum samples have tested negative for the equine disease, which has no cure or a vaccine.
 
 The government also told the court that no equine event or gathering can be allowed in the capital as there is a January 15 notification in force which prohibits movement of horses to and from Delhi for three months.
 
 After the submissions, HC listed the matter for further hearing on April 4.
 
 HC is hearing a petition by the Delhi Race Horses Owners’ Association challenging the Delhi government’s February 13 communication to the race club to postpone or cancel the North India Derby horse race scheduled for February 27.
