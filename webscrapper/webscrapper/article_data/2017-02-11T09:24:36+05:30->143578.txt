LUCKNOW: Free smartphones, bicycles and scholarships for girl students, welfare schemes for minorities and police reforms will dominate the 10-point common minimum programme (CMP) that   (SP) chief   and   vice-president   are slated to release jointly in Lucknow on Saturday.

 This will be the second time that the two leaders will come together before the media after the joint presser on January 29 in the state capital where the `UP Ke Ladke' -the alliance catchline referring to the coming together of Akhilesh and Rahul -will together showcase the high points of their party manifestos which have already been released.
 
 Sources in SP said the idea behind the CMP was to bring before the people certain important issues which both the parties will take up on a priority basis once the alliance is voted to power in the state. “Important schemes already mentioned in the SP manifesto like free smartphones will obviously be the highlight of the CMP but it will also include extension of some other schemes already promised by the two parties,“ said a senior SP leader.
 
 For instance, the ambit of free bicycles and scholarships to girl students will be increased apart from some kind of relief on loans of farmers and reduction of power tariff. The CMP is also expected to highlight the commitment of the alliance towards the minorities and other oppressed sections of the society with a commitment for employment in government jobs in proportion to their population-share in the state.
 
 The two parties are also learnt to have agreed to jointly pursue implementation of police reforms as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, which have not been implemented in totality in the state.
 
 The move will not only ensure a more effective police force in the state but also come as a relief for the men in uniform with regards to certain service matters related to transfer, posting and promotion.
