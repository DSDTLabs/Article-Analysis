BHUBANESWAR:   in the city came forward to   and puppies at an   held here on Sunday. In the first-of-its-kind   in the city organised by  , Ekamra, a dozen puppies got adopted. 

 "The aim of the campaign is to secure permanent homes for rescued or orphaned shelter animals. We have also been promoting adoption of Indian pariah dogs from the streets instead of purchase of pedigree dogs from puppy mills or pet stores. The response to the first camp is quite encouraging and we noticed a sense of responsibility and compassion among people for stray dogs," said Purabi Patra, founder of the trust. 
 
 The volunteers of the trust had been rescuing stray puppies and keeping them in shelter homes. "Shelters are meant to house animals temporarily. In order to be able to help more animals in need, shelters must find loving adoptive homes for the animals they take in," she said. 
 
 Stray dogs have posed quite a few problems in Bhubaneswar of late, with a large number of them dying in road accidents every day, in addition to cases of dog bites being reported every day. Volunteers of the trust visit the houses of people interested in adoptions to ensure that the dogs will be taken care of.
