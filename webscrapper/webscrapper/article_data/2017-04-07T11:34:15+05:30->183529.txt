PATNA: Two persons – a contractor and a trader – were gunned down in separate incidents in   town on Thursday.
 
  While Atul Prasad Sahi (42), a contractor was shot dead by unidentified criminals at   under   police station in the morning,   Agarwal (45), a biscuit trader, was gunned down near   police station around 10pm.
  
  The deceased contractor has been identified as Atul Prasad Sahi (42), a resident of Virpur village under Kanti police station in the district. However, he was presently living in a rented accommodation with his two children and wife in the locality where he was gunned down by the criminals with an assault rifle.
  
  SHO of Mithanpura police station Vijay Rai said two motorcycle-borne criminals started spraying bullets indiscriminately from sophisticated weapons when Sahi was talking to some persons in front of his residence. The SHO said Sahi was associated with a private firm engaged in rural electrification project in the state. “He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where the doctors pronounced him brought dead. Police later recovered six empty cartridges from the spot,” the SHO added.
  
  He said the grieving family members of the deceased have so far not lodged any complaint with the police.
  
  Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar said it was probably a case of murder for extortion. “The victim had received a threat call recently. Three persons were arrested on the charge of threatening him,” the SSP added.
  
  In another incident, Om Prakash Agarwal (45), a biscuit trader, was gunned down near Rani Sati Mandir under Town police station around 10pm. “An empty cartridge has been recovered from the spot.
