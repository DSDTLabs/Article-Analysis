NEW DELHI: Having entered the knockouts of the 2016-17   by virtue of finishing second behind Mumbai in Group A, Gujarat beat Odisha in the quarter-finals and Jharkhand in the semi-finals to enter their second Ranji final in 83 years of the competition's history. They now face defending Ranji champions - and 41-time champions - Mumbai in the final at Indore's Holkar Stadium from January 10.

 Here's a quick look at how Gujarat have made it this far. 
 
 
 
 
 Pushed into a corner after Baroda muscled their way to 544/8 declared, Gujarat were carried from 177/4 at the fall of skipper   for 20 to 555/4, and with it three vital points, by Manpreet Juneja's unbeaten 201 and 110 not out from Axar Patel. The pair put on 238 for the fifth wicket, after Juneja combined with Rujul Bhatt to add 140 for the same wicket before the latter was forced to retire hurt.
 
 
 
 
 A crushing win, Gujarat's biggest of the season. What started poorly - Gujarat were bowled out for 187 on day one, with only Parthiv (61) crossing 30 - turned into a huge victory after Railways folded under scorecard pressure on day four. Five wickets to Mehul Patel delivered Gujarat the first-innings lead, with Railways all out for 124, and in the second innings they made 437/7 with opener   scoring the first of five centuries this season. On the fourth day, Railways lost their last six wickets for 30 runs to hand Gujarat victory by 294 runs.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 None of the four batsmen who crossed the 50-mark was able to convert into a century, but 347 on the board in the first innings was enough for Gujarat to take the lead. Hardik Patel followed four in Uttar Pradesh's first innings with 7/72 in the second, after the opposition had been set a target of 308. Gujarat's second innings saw them collapse from 157/3 to 201 all out, but Hardik's startling success ensured that was a blip.
 
 
 
 
 Terrible smog in the country's capital meant the players were forced to wear masks and leave the Feroz Shah Kotla without the toss happening. Gujarat and Bengal got one point each. 
 
 
 
 
 Gujarat picked up three points from this game, with Rush Kalaria's 4/74 a big factor in Madhya Pradesh folding for 252 in response to Gujarat's 302. Then rookie opener Samit Gohel (104) and Parthiv (139) carried the team to 324/6. Set 375, MP made 176/5 with Harpreet Singh scoring a century after an early wobble. 
 
 
 
 
 Gujarat's bowlers, led by  's 6/71, sealed a slender lead over the defending champions and that fetched them three crucial points. An opening stand of 172 between Gohel (87) and Panchal (232) was not built on by the other batsmen, and yet a total of 437 proved good enough. Bumrah chipped away around Shreyas Iyer's 194, and Mumbai were kept to 422. Panchal continued his stellar run with 56 not out in Gujarat's second innings of 82 without loss before the draw came to a close.
 
 
 
 
 Another big total, three more points - except Gujarat, now led by Axar with Parthiv recalled to India's Test team to play England, should have won this one. Panchal's career-best 314 not out was nearly half of Gujarat's 624, with sixties to Bhargav Merai, Rujul Bhatt, Axar and Kalaria fine supporting roles. Kalaria then took four to keep Punjab to 247 in 85.2 overs, thus giving Gujarat a big lead. Forced to follow-on, Punjab averted a loss thanks to a stubborn stand of 165 in 66 overs between centurion Jiwanjot Singh and Uday Kaul. At stumps on day three, Punjab were 36/1 with a deficit of 341, but Jiwanjot (101*) and Kaul (64*) denied Gujarat victory. 
 
 
 
 
 Panchal's fourth hundred (113) was the top score and the only one in excess of 44 as Gujarat - led by Parthiv, back from India duty - were bowled out for 307 in 112 overs, and that was the main reason they conceded three points for the first time. Abhinav Mukund missed a century by one run but Kaushik Gandhi's 202 and 102 from Vijay Shankar carried TN to 580/6 in 229 overs and 946 minutes. With 26 points to Mumbai's 30, Gujarat were second in Group A and due to face Odisha in the knockouts. 
 
 
 
 
 In trouble at 71/6, Gujarat found their batting heroes in Chirag Gandhi (81) and Kalaria (73) who fashioned a clinical partnership of 154 for the seventh wicket to revive the innings to 263. Bumrah then led the way with 5/41 as Odisha were bowled out for 199 in 73.1 overs, thus giving Gujarat three points. When Gujarat batted again, Gohel shattered a 117-year-old record in compiling a landmark 359 not out, the highest score by an opener who carried his bat in first-class cricket. Gujarat finished on 641 in 227.4 overs. Odisha, set an unattainable 706, made 81/1 to exit the competition.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Panchal's 149 out of a first-innings total of 390 made him the first Gujarat batsman to score five hundreds in any season of the Ranji Trophy, and surpassed his previous best of 655 runs in 2015-16. Jharkhand, in their first semi-final, made good progress and on the back of Ishank Jaggi's 129, eked out a lead of 18. At the time it did not seem massive, but veteran RP Singh's 6/90 went on to prove exactly that. Gujarat, missing the injured Kalaria, were bowled out for 252 with Juneja (81) and Gandhi (51) scoring fifties, which left Jharkhand to get 235 to make the final. For the third time in the season, both openers failed to score and from 6/2 the rot set in, led superbly by Bumrah who polished off Jharkhand for 111 with 6/29, his best figures in first-class cricket.
