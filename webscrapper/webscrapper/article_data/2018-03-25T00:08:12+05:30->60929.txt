NAVI MUMBAI: Residents who had free access to visit the sector 19   based theme park known as R R Patil Garden and   in sector 26, Kopri will have to pay an entrance fee now. The   administration was given the go-ahead by the general body for charging entry and other applicable fees. 

 Civic administration cited the cost of maintainence and upkeep of both the theme gardens as the reason for levying fees. 
 
 As per the proposal, visitors will have to to pay Rs 10 (adults ) and Rs 5 for children to enter the parks. Additionally the civic body has worked out a seperate fee structure for monthly passes to visit the garden, using the amphitheatre, parking vehicles and even for skating. 
 
 “Some fee is necessary to ensure that the infrastructure is well maintained. The entry fee proposed is very nominal and shouldn't be a problem for citizens,” said an official from garden department. 
 
 Sector 19  , spread over 17,000 sq m area is equipped with numerous attractions such a sun dial, skating rink, open gym with eight types of excising equipment among others. Likewise, the   spread over 9,000 sq m has a life-size tortoise installation. 
 
 NCP corporator and leader of the house Ravindra Ithape supported the move of charging entry fees. 
 
 “Having entry fees will prevent vandalism as well as restrict access to drug addicts or mischief makers. However, the fees proposed for hiring amphitheatre or for skating is steep. Administration has been asked to reduce it by 50%. It has been suggested that no fees are to be charged for skating,” said Ithape. Kopri corporator Usha Bhoir said, “Ideally, the civic administration shouldn't be levying any fees but as it is a nominal amount, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
