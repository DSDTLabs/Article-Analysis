AHMEDABAD: While agitations by   and Dalits are prominent,   CM Vijay Rupani, said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and BR Ambedkar were ‘Rashtrapurush’ and not mere community leaders. Rupani strategically chose the platform of the inaugural ceremony of Global Patidar Business Organization (GBPO), to says this.

 “It is unfortunate for this country that some people have made attempts to align ‘Rashtrapurush’ such as Sardar, Ambedkar or Gandhi with politics. These people have developed their own politics and represented these men of honour merely as leaders of their community. However, these men are an inspiration for an entire nation,” said the chief minister.
 
 Rupani hailed the mission of the Sardardham Vishwa Patidar Kendra (SVPK) and its philosophy of welfare of the country through welfare of the society, and said, “It is important to take lessons from the past when we were divided and ruled upon. The nation’s interest should come first and such nationalism should prevail.”
 
 Deputy CM  , said, “We will soon submit a detailed proposal for the government scheme, ‘Bin-Anamat Arthik Nigam’. We have earmarked a budget of Rs 600 crore for welfare of 58 communities falling under non-reserved category as part of the state budget. A primary meeting was conducted today and will be presented before the cabinet either this week or next, for necessary approvals. We will soon implement it.”
