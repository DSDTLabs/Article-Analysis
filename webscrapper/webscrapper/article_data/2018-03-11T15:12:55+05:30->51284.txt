Actor   has described her journey into parenthood as  . 

  
  
 Reportedly, the 38-year-old actor, who gave birth to daughter   in December last year, said she was a changed woman as she was 'not a kid person' earlier.
 
  "It's really profound and strange. I was not a kid person at all. I was the person, if you had a baby at a party, I would go up to them and shake their hand and be like, 'Hello.' So I didn't know (or) understand how to be around babies. 
 
 "I was on planes (and) when babies would cry, I would be mad at the families. Now I'm like, 'Let them cry, let them do whatever they want. They can sit on me and poop if they want.' Now I know more," Kaling said.
 
  The actor also joked that her three-month-old daughter does not recognise her as she was busy promoting her latest release, 'A Wrinkle In Time'. 
 
  "She's often like, 'Who dat?' to me because I've been a little busy promoting this movie," she added.
