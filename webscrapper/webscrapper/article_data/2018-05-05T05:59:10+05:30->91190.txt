MUMBAI: With bail secured, will   be able to return to active politics?   Nawab Malik said this may take a few months, but not too long. "We welcome the HC order. When the final verdict is delivered, Bhujbal will be proven innocent. It was a case of vendetta politics. His bail plea was opposed even after a crucial PMLA section was scrapped," Malik said. A senior   leader said that in his political career spanning over five decades, Bhujbal had seen several ups and downs, so he would surely re-launch himself. 

 Bhujbal has a following among OBCs in the state, and NCP expects his release will help it strengthen its base among these groups in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly polls. "NCP paid a price in the recent civic polls owing to Bhujbal's absence," the leader said. 
 
 In two years, not only NCP but some BJP leaders too have stood by Bhujbal. Rural development minister Pankaja Munde was the first BJP leader to call on him; she was followed by minister of state for social justice Dilip Kamble. NCP leaders Praful Patel, Supriya Sule and Dhananjay Munde had called on him, while NCP chief Sharad Pawar had written to CM Devendra Fadnavis saying that if something went wrong with Bhujbal’s health, it would be the government’s responsibility.
 
 While in custody, Bhujbal was admitted to JJ hospital for a long period. He was later admitted to Bombay hospital and is now at KEM. Though he cited health issues, he faced accusations that he did not suffer from any disease but had been kept in hospital to avoid custody.
