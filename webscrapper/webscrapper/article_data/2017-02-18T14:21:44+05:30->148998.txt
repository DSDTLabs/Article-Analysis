NEW DELHI: Nearly a dozen top bureaucrats from 23 states including   took up a unique exercise of emptying some of the   in a   to demonstrate how it’s the   for rural folk and also to end the stigma of cleaning these pits.

 “It's perfectly safe and clean to empty a twin pit toilet. The @swachhbharat team joins Gangadevipally village today…Great to be emptying a toilet pit in Gangadevipally, Warangal,” Union sanitation drinking water and sanitation secretary Parameswaran Iyer tweeted after opening one such pit.
 
 Iyer told TOI that each of the principal secretaries from states who participated in the exercise are carrying a bottle of the compost from the emptied pits with them.
 
 “We had twin objective to demonstrate how twin-pit toilets are one of the best suitable technology in rural areas. Second, there is a stigma among people to empty these pits after closing one pit for six months or a year. Once you close one pit for months, the excreta gets converted to clean compost,” Iyer said.
 
 In the case of twin pit toilets, the cover slab has two drop holes, one over each pit. Only one pit is used at a time. When one is full, its drop hole is closed and the second pit is used. After six months to one year, the waste stored in the first pit can be removed safely and used as soil conditioner. The pit can be used again when the second pit is filled up. This alternating cycle can be repeated.
