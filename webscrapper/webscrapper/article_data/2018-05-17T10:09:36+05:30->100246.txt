TIRUVANNAMALAI/CHENNAI: A week has gone by after the villagers of Athimur and neighbouring villages lynched a 65-year-old woman and grievously injured four others near Polur in Tiruvannamalai district, but the government is yet to extend any financial assistance to the victims' families. One of the victims has been battling for life at a private hospital in Chennai. 

 Gajendran,  , father of two daughters, had accompanied his mother-in-law   and their relatives K Venkatesan, 52, of Old Pallavaram, S Mohankumar, 45, and M Chandrasekaran, 52, who came from Malaysia, on May 9. They were on their way to their family temple in Thumbakottan Paarai at the foothills of Jawadhu Hills. However, the villagers mistook them for 'child traffickers' and unleashed a deadly attack on them at Athimur.
 
 Rukhmani died on the way to the hospital, while others sustained serious injuries. Gajendran was admitted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital and then referred to the Christian Medical College (CMC) Hospital. Rukhmani was the wife of Ramachandran, an ex-serviceman.
 
 R Gopinath said his brother-in-law Gajendran was battling for life and lamented that "no help" has reached them from the government till date. "Gajendran underwent a neurosurgery at CMC three days ago, but his condition has not improved. We have discharged him from there and admitted him to a private hospital (Chettinad Health City) in Chennai," Gopinath said, adding that they have been spending from their savings to save him. 
 
 They have spent around 7 lakh for Gajendran's treatment till now. "There is no word from the government, the officials or the police," Gopinath, second son of Rukhmani, said.
