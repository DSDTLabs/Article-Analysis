AMARAVATI: The battle for Andhra Pradesh took a decisive turn on Friday with all the five YSR Congress MPs resigning from the Lok Sabha and sitting on an indefinite dharna at AP Bhavan and Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP president   countering it by vowing to take his fight to the people through a bus yatra and rallies across the state.

 On the directive of their party president  , the five YSR   MPs, Y V Subba Reddy, Mekapati Rajamohan Reddy, Y S Avinash Reddy, V Varaprasada Rao and P V Mithun Reddy, submitted their resignations in the prescribed format to Lok Sabha Speaker   around noon after the lower house was adjourned sine die on Friday. The MPs then drove to Andhra Bhavan on Ashoka Road and sat on an indefinite hunger strike seeking special category status (SCS) for AP.
