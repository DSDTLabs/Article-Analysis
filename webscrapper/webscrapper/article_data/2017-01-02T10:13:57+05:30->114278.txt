COIMBATORE: As many as 127 members of the   (NTK) participated in a protest against the central government to lift the ban on Jallikattu on Sunday. 

 Members of the party including 52 women took part in the protest at the Sathyamangalam bus stand between 10am to 12pm.
 
  "The central government is attempting to put an end to a long-practiced tradition. Jallikattu is Tamil Nadu's tradition, and in that way, is also India's tradition," R Chezhian, a member of the NTK said.
 
 "The   (SC) is also in the favour of the Central government. The Centre and the apex court are favouring   (PeTA), an American NGO," Chezhian said. 
 
 "The Centre should understand that the game is attached to the sentiments of the Tamilians. We urge them to reconsider our proposal, and remove the ban on Jallikattu," he furter said. 
 
 People in and around Erode district participated in the protest.
