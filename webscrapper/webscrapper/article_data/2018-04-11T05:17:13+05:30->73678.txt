NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday reiterated that railway minister   be removed from office, alleging his family had business interests in companies that were in default and their working was shrouded in mystery while BJP countered the allegations saying the minister wound up his professional activities on becoming a minister. 

  Stating that PM Narendra Modi spoke of "swachhta" while ignoring it in his government, Congress spokesman   issued a list of 11 companies and alleged that directorship of these companies circulated among four families. He alleged that Goyal's wife owned a company that started with Rs 1 lakh capital and made earnings of Rs 30 crore in 10 years, and called it the "Jay Shah model" of investment. 
 
  Khera alleged that whenever Goyal or his family members quit as directors of these firms, they were replaced by the same set of people . 
 
  BJP said Congress was misrepresenting facts. A BJP release said Goyal was a chartered accountant and financial advisor before May 2014 and he wound up his professional activities on becoming a minister. 
 
  He provided consultancy services through Intercon Advisors Private Limited. From its founding, Intercon earned professional income on services rendered and accumulated reserves of around Rs 30 crore with income tax payment of around Rs 15 crore and service tax of around Rs 6.6 crore, the party said . 
 
  BJP clarified that a consultancy company did not require much capital and the reserves were accumulated profit over the years. "In May 2014, Goyal resigned from the board of the company and it started functioning as an investment company managing its investments," it said . Since the companies didn't hold any major assets and the business operations were being closed down, practising CAs working with Intercon were inducted as directors, the party said.
