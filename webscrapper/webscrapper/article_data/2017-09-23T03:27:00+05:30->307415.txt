Panaji: While accepting that there were instances of police-drug dealer nexus, town and country planning minister and minister for agriculture Vijai Sardesai said that chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s decision to write to MLAs and ask them not to publicly talk about drugs was the right step.

 Sardesai said that there were certain lobbies working to demoralize the Goa Police and to give the state a bad name. 
 
 "Certain lobbies are keen to ridicule and malign the state’s image. We must not allow this. As elected representatives, we cannot be knowingly or unknowingly help them in the process. So, I think what the CM said is correct,” Sardesai said.
 
 The Goa Forward Party president also said he had no problem if Parrikar’s letter was directed against Goa Forward MLAs.
 
 “We as legislators, and more so as ministers, have a certain responsibility to factually support our statements with proof. If we are in the government we have to speak with responsibly. Secondly, we have to see that the disillusionment the public have with law and order authorities does not continue,” Sardesai said.
