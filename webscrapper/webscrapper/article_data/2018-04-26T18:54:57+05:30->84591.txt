Colva: The Public Works Department (PWD) has covered potholes at the Colva circle days after a news report about the issue appeared in TOI.  The department had, for months prior, neglected the repairs of this patch of road, thus causing hardship to commuters at the busy intersection.  The ostensible reason for the neglect was that PWDâ€™s assistant engineer, Prasad Panandikar, who is in charge of roads and bridges, wanted the water department to plug some leak in a pipe meant to water the island.  The potholes were, however, covered after the TOI report on the issue.
