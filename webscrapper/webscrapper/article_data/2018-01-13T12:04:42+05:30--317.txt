THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   state president Kummanam   has termed the statement of CPM leader E P Jayarajan that there were some scientific aspects to temple rituals and customs 'hollow' and 'insincere'. 

 "I read the statement of Jayarajan with laughter. His words reflect the crisis the Marxist movement faces. It's the realisation of losing the earth beneath the foot that prompted a leader like Jayarajan to speak like this. Spirituality and communism are two ideologies that move in opposite directions," Rajasekharan said. 
 
 "Though it was C   who opined that disintegration of temples would only help bring down superstition, it was the CPM leaders who took the idea far and wide," he added.
 
 The explanation sought from minister   for offering puja at   temple and the CPM's earlier diktat against party members organizing Ganapathy homan at their homes could only be seen as the extention of CPM's stand against belief in temple customs and rituals, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the two-day BJP core committee meeting began here on Friday.
