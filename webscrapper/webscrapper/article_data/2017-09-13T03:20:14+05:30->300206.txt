NOIDA: Commuters remained stranded for over an hour at the Telephone Exchange intersection in Sector 19 on Tuesday as   took to the street to   the lack of “adequate safety” of their community.

 Around 200 traders gathered a few metres away from Sector 20 police station to protest against the shooting of a 50-year-old businessman outside his Sector 50 house on Monday night.
 
 Yadram Garg suffered a gunshot injury in his head after unidentified bike-borne assailants shot at him on Monday. Garg, who owns a hardware shop in Sector 9, has been admitted to   in Sector 50, and his situation is critical. 
 
 Angered over the incident, the traders shouted slogans against police and demanded assurances from a senior police officer. However, none of the senior officers turned up to pacify the crowd.
 
 SP (City) Arun Kumar told TOI, “We have assured Garg’s family that we will try to nab the perpetrators within 48 hours.”
