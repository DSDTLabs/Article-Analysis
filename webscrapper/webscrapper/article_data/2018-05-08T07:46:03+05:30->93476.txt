KOCHI:   district panchayat will construct mobile crematorium units in various parts of the district within two years. According to panchayat authorities, they are planning to build crematoriums in eastern parts of the district, including Varapetty in   as there are not adequate crematoriums in this area.

 Panchayat has set aside Rs 20 lakh for setting up mobile crematoriums and for making it more eco –friendly it has set aside around Rs 1 crore. “The population density is increasing every year so we need to upgrade crematoriums in our district based on the requirements in this regard. Since it is cost - effective, people prefer cremation to burial. In addition to that, since population is growing, the availability of space or land to set up burial grounds has reduced and as a result crematoriums are more convenient,” said an official with district panchayat.
 
 Abdul Muthalib, vice- president, Ernakulam district panchayat said that they are at present conducting feasibility studies regarding where to construct crematoriums. “At present we haven’t finalized anything. In the coming months, we will be able to come up with a plan as to how we are going to go ahead with the project,” said Muthalib.
 
 “Our first preference is to build a biogas-powered crematorium. The operation of electric-powered crematoriums has become very expensive these days as the power consumption is high. Constructing eco-friendly crematoriums is our priority,” said Muthalib.
 
 Meanwhile, officials with   said that they are planning to set up mobile LPG – powered crematoriums in the district.
 
 “We are planning to set up gas crematoriums in places where local – self-government institutions find place for the same. The project will be implemented with the help of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board,” said an official with state Suchitwa Mission.
