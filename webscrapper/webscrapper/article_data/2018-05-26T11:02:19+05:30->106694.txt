PATIALA: Punjab’s first compressed natural gas (CNG) station was thrown open to motorists at   town, Fatehgarh Sahib district, on Friday. 

  Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairperson Kahan Singh   inaugurated the station commissioned by  , a group company of Cadilla Pharmaceuticals. This station has the facility of dispensing CNG for cars, auto-rickshaws and buses.
 
 A day before its inauguration, a part of the station caught fire from a spark due to welding done at the site. At least 10 fire tenders were rushed to the spot to control the flames on Thursday night.
 
 Pannu said the state government was alarmed by rising pollution. “PPCB is making allout efforts to control this, and the use of CNG as an alternative to conventional fuel will play an important role in controlling pollution levels,” he said.
 
 When asked about the use of diesel-run three-wheelers, he said the government was aware of the pollution caused by them and the PPCB had recommended it not to register such vehicles in future. “Three-wheeler owners have been directed to convert their vehicles to run on CNG, which costs Rs 20,000. PPCB is bargaining with the kit company to give subsidy to owners,” he said.
