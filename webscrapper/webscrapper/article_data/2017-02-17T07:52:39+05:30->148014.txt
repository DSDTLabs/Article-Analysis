HYDERABAD: The   process that shook the nation has failed to negatively impact Telangana. The state finance department in its report to   pointed that the note ban had a nominal effect only on key departments. On the whole, the loss of revenue due to demonetisaton was around `800 to `1000 crore, the report concluded.

 Braving the demonetisation drive, Telangana continues to grow at an impressive over 10 per cent rate in all sectors except land registrations.The finance department calculated that there was no impact on sale of liquor and commercial taxes which account for more than 80 per cent of the to tal revenues of the state.“From registrations and stamp duty , the government expected a revenue of `4,200 crore. However, there would be a shortfall of about 20 per cent due to demonetisation. The bank restrictions have played spoilsport in this sector,“ said a senior official in the finance department.
 
 The state had set a target to earn `43,115 crore from commercial tax for the year 2016-17 and nearly 70 per cent of that had been already credited in the state exchequer. The remaining amount will usually come in March as traders wait for the calculation of total turnover before making the final payment. The transport department faced a fall in income after note ban in November and December, but recovered later.
