Panaji: The Goa government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the central government to set up a regional   centre at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, health minister Vishwajit Rane told TOI.

 “The health secretary signed the MoU on Thursday. As much as Rs 45 crore has already been sanctioned for the project,” Rane said.
 
  The comprehensive cost of the initiative is estimated to be Rs 100 crore, 40% of which will be borne by the state government. 
 
 Although plans for a regional cancer centre were afoot a year ago, they were kept on the back burner until last month. Rane said he would not tolerate any further delays in the project and that a three-member team comprising GMC dean Dr Pradeep Naik, medical superintendent Dr S M Bandekar, and radiology department professor Dr Mahesh Sardesai would be sent to Delhi next week to pursue it.
 
 The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation has been identified as the nodal agency to develop the cancer centre, the health minister said. 
 
 Over 250 cases of breast cancer and 80-100 cases of colorectal cancer are reported in the state every year.
