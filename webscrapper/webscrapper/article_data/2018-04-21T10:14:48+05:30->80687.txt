UDAIPUR: In a midnight heist, robbers looted Rs 18.65 lakh from an   at Dabok, some 20 kilometers from Udaipur city and in the wee hours of Friday. Shockingly, the ATM is situated near a petrol pump and is hardly 100 meters away from the Dabok police station, yet none of the cops came to know about the loot.

 A complaint has been registered and police has launched a search operation to identify the culprits. “The matter was reported when a customer went to the ATM to withdraw money and saw the machine broken. He called up the bank and that is when the incident came to light around 8.30 am. Burglars used gas cutters to break in the equipment,” police informed. 
 
 The heist seemed well planned and as per   footage, five men had come in a jeep in the wee hours. Two stood guard outside while three got inside the cabin and cut open the machine to take away the cash. Forensic teams have been pressed into service. Police has scanned the footage and pointed towards some suspects. Video footage is also being acquired from highway toll plazas to identify the vehicle which the robbers used. Police said that investigation is underway and more details would emerge soon.
 
 Another ATM was looted on Thursday night at Titardi near Udaipur city. Robbers took away 6 Lakh rupees cash from the machine which too had been cut open through gas cutter device police said. It is yet to be ascertained whether it is a same gang involved in the loot that robbed money from Dabok.
