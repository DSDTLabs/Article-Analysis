NEW DELHI: Manufacturing activity improved for the ninth consecutive month in April on the back of new orders with renewed rise in employment, while price pressures eased, a survey showed on Wednesday.

 
 The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ index (PMI) rose from 51 to 51.6 in April. The 50 point mark separates expansion from contraction. This indicated a faster improvement in the health of the country’s manufacturing economy than in the previous month, but pointed to a modest upturn that was weaker than the series trend. 
 
 The PMI survey is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questionnaires sent to purchasing executives in over 400 industrial companies and is regarded as an advance indicator for manufacturing activity in the country.
