TIRUNELVELI: The district administration has began a free battery operated four-wheeler service from the Kokkirakulam Bus Stop to the Tirunelveli collectorate for the benefit of the differently-abled and the aged coming there.

 Though the distance is only about 500m, collector   told reporters that it would be of great help to people who face difficulty to come to the collectorate amidst traffic and the scores of people who occupy the roadside and also a portion of the road.
 
 “Every Monday, about 1,000 to 1,200 persons come to the collectorate for the weekly grievances meeting. On other days, more than 200 come. This includes a sizeable number of aged and differently-abled people,” the collector said.
 
 Nanduri said that on one occasion a well to do person noticed the plight of the people and on condition of anonymity donated Rs 5.5 lakh to buy, operate and maintain a battery-operated car for the benefit of such persons. “Initially, it will be operated on Monday and for the special grievances meeting for differently-abled persons. We will consider using this service on other days based on the response,” he added.
 
 On Monday, the collector inaugurated the vehicle and drove the first batch of aged people who had difficulty in walking.
 
 However, the vehicle did not make more than a couple of trips as many were not aware of the free service. Officials are confident that more people would make use of the service once they come to know about it.
