HYDERABAD: Chief minister   on Wednesday made it clear that the Telangana government had never sought Parade Grounds as the venue for constructing the new Secretariat. "In fact, we are eyeing 55 acres of land for the new Secretariat. This will include 33 acres of Bison Polo grounds and 22 acres of adjacent Gymknana Grounds. We have received in-principal approval from the union defence ministry for being handed over the Bison Polo grounds,"   said at a press conference here on Wednesday. Incidentally, the 22-acre Gymkhana belongs to the defence ministry and sources said the TRS regime is still negotiating with the Centre for taking it over. 

 In the context of protests over Parade Grounds being take over for the new Secretariat, he said: "I personally oppose Parade Grounds being taken over as it is used by children to play and it is a favourite haunt of senior citizens for walking. No normal person will convert a good park or stadium into a building and deprive the people of such a facility." Elaborating on what would come up on the 55 acres, he said: "We plan to buld a world class Secretariat, a joint legislature building and Kala Bharati with a sprawling garden for state celebrations. The structures would be iconic." While the Bison Polo grounds is almost in their kitty, they are still awaiting the nod for Gymknana grounds, he said. "In the last 60 years, we have been begging the defence ministry for nod to hold meetings in Parade Grounds. Should we not have our own place to hold state functions?" the CM said.
 
 On being asked whether the old secretariat complex will be handed over to private people for commercial use, the chief minister said there was no such plan. "How many parks or public places have been handed over to private companies in the last three years? This is all misinformation fed by some vested parties," he said.
