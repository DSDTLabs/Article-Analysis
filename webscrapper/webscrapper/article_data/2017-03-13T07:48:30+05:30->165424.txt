CHANDIGARH: Punjab voters have given a thumbs down to turncoats as less than one-third of those fielded by the three main political parties have made to the state legislative assembly. Put together, the Congress, SAD and AAP had given tickets to 33 politicians who switched parties in the run-up to 2017 elections. Of them, voters approved only 10. 

 For the Congress and the SAD, the results of party-hoppers were in keeping with the overall outcome. While six of the 11 main turncoats who got tickets from the Congress were elected, the number was two out of nine for the SAD.
 
 In case one needed more indicators of how AAP made major miscalculations, 12 of the 14 leaders from other parties, which it preferred over its own volunteers, were rejected by voters. Former Congressmen who managed a victory on AAP tickets had joined the party well before election season. Sukhpal Singh Khaira bagged Bholath and Aman Arora got Sunam for AAP.
 
 Ex-Congress MP from Hoshiarpur Charanjit Channi lost from Nawanshahr, while Congress former leader Charanjit Singh from Chamkaur Sahib; even Darshan Lal Bhagat of BJP, previously from Jalandhar West, former BSP leaders Hans Raj Rana from Adampur and Arshad Dalli failed to make a dent in Malerkotla for AAP.
 
 From the Congress, while ex-BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu and former Akali Pargat Singh managed easy victories, former Akali Ranjit Singh Rana lost in Bholath and so did Darshan Lal from Balachaur.
 
 From SAD, former Congress MLA Surinderpal Singh Sibia was at third position in Barnala and so was his party colleague from the past Kabir Dass in Nabha. Former BSP leaders Baldev Khaira in Phillaur and Sukhvinder Singh Sukhi from Banga were the only two lucky ones.
