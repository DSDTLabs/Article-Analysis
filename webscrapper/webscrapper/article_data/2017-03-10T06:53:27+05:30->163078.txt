BENGALURU: St Joseph’s College (Autonomous) has dismissed one of its associate professors from the English department on Thursday morning. 

 Ashley Tellis, a  , has more than 12 years of teaching experience under his belt, both in India and abroad. In 2010, he was sacked from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH). Tellis said an   filed by him revealed that was he was told to go by IITH because of ‘negative student evaluations’.
 
 “I got a call at 9.30am in the middle of a class, asking me to come to the principal’s office. When I reached there, I was told by the principal that I was sharing my personal opinion with the students, and this was disturbing them. I was then told to leave the college premises immediately. They refused to specify what personal opinions they were referring to. Under my contract, I am supposed to be given a month’s notice before being sacked, something the institution didn’t follow,” Tellis said.
 
 “I am sure students will testify to enjoying my classes. It is possible that I was sacked because students felt comfortable about airing their opinions in my class, many of which were against some of the harsher rules prescribed by the college such as boys and girls not being allowed to share earphones or hug; boys not being allowed to wear ear-studs; girls disallowed to colour their hair or wear clothes like leggings,” he maintained.
 
 “I am planning to start a social media campaign, but as a gay and an activist, I am tired and exhausted of being treated badly by the staff and institutions for my sexual orientation,” he added.
 
 “After holding several rounds of discussions, based on complaints lodged by disturbed students, the management decided to relieve  . This has nothing to do with his sexual orientation. SJC has always expressed solidarity with sexual minorities. The college strongly condemns any move by Ashley to tarnish its image,” a college spokesperson said.
