AHMEDABAD: Between March 27 and April 2 this year, 627 people in Ahmedabad were bitten by dogs. This is the highest number of dog bites recorded in Gujarat in a single week. 

 In wake of the rise in dog bites, AMC officials have decided to set a target of 1,000 dog sterilizations a month for each of the four agencies working for the civic body. The decision will be finalized on Thursday in the standing committee.
 
  
  Now, each of the four agencies that sterilize dogs for the civic body will have to sterilize 1,000 dogs a month in their designated areas.
 
 Analyzing the 6-month sterilization progress in the city by the concerned NGOs shows that   is the only agency that claims it can achieve over a thousand sterilizations each month. The agency on the bottom of the list,  , has managed to do just 76 sterilizations in six months, and that too in October last year.
 
 In all, 14,869 dogs have been sterilized in the last six months in the city. Of the four NGOs the maximum sterilizations were claimed by Animal Rights Fund with 5,765 male and female dogs, People for Animals (Gomtipur) has claimed that it has sterilized 5,192 dogs, while the third NGO,  , claims to have sterilized 3,421 dogs.
