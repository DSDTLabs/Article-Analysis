Director   has chosen newcomer   to compose the music for Thadam, his film that stars   in the lead. Arun, a “Madurai paiyyan“, says that his story is that of “any small town guy with a dream“. “I have been learning music from childhood, and it was only when I joined college that I came to Chennai. But in the second year, I realised that engineering was not my cup of tea and quit college and started working part time, in addition to teaching music,“ begins   on his journey.

 Gradually, he developed a network, and started uploading his works online. Offers for working on short films and ads came up. He also worked with Hip Hop Tamizha and Simbu for their film projects. And from 2015, he started making cover videos of popular songs, and singles with popular singers. This got him noticed by people in the film industry.
 
 On how he managed to land this film, Arun says, “I have known Thadam's associate director Siva for some time. I'd been asking him to let me know when Magizh Thirumeni anna's next film, as I'm a huge fan of his Thadaiyara Thakka. One day, Siva told me that the director had started his next film, and was looking for new composers. I met him and played some of my works to him. He gave me a situation from the film and asked me to come up with a rough track. Once I delivered him that, he took me on board.“
 
 The film's music, he says, will have a “unique palette of sounds.“ “My forte is Carnatic minimalism, which is presenting the elaborate style of Carnatic music in a minimalist style. This way, it will become accessible to common audiences, too.I'm also experimenting with this film, by going to the location of street musicians and recording their music there,“ informs the debutant composer.
