Jaipur: A 22-year-old man who was earlier booked for molesting a 10-year-old girl, was again arrested on Wednesday after he sexually assaulted another minor girl aged three, under the limits of Gharsana police station area of Sri Gagnanagar district.

 According to SHO Vikram Singh the accused identified as Buddha Ram, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to jail for a similar crime in 2017. After coming out of jail, the accused molested the three-year-old girl near a brick manufacturing unit.
 
 He was caught after the girl raised alarm as she screamed for help. People gathered at the area in large numbers and informed the police about the incident.
 
 “He has been booked under relevant sections of the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) and IPC,” Singh said, adding that he is being interrogated.
 
 The local police are also studying his previous criminal record and the present status of the case for which he was sent to jail. The initial investigation indicates that he had come to Rajasthan to work as a labourer.
 
 “The parents of the minor girl worked at a nearby factory, they have alleged that the accused took their daughter to a secluded area and sexually abused her. When the girl raised an alarm, he fled from the spot but was caught by the police,” an official informed.
 
 Police said that the accused seems to be a habitual offender who had been living at a rented accommodation in the city. He had come out of the prison in March this year. Additional SP Bharat Raj said that the accused was sent to jail last year, but was released by the court.
