NEW DELHI: The Class X pass percentage in Delhi government schools has dropped to 69.3 from 92.4 last year, indicating a drastic decline after the Central Board of Secondary Education reverted to board-conducted examinations following an eight-year gap. Though Delhi government had adopted numerous methods to ensure that its students fared well in the dreaded exams, it is clear that the directorate of education has its work cut out in the coming academic session.

 According to   data for Delhi, the government and government-aided schools had the worst results in the capital, with a pass percentage of 69.3 for the former and 69.9 for the latter. Last year, education minister and deputy chief minister   had claimed in a series of tweets that the 2017 pass percentage had risen to 92.4, an improvement of 3.2 over 2016. 
 
 
  
 In comparison, central government schools did commendably well, with Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas logging a success rate of 98.6% and the  , 97.1%.
 
 Sources said that at a government boys’ school in Shalimar Bagh, only 45 of the 138 students passed, a pass rate of 31.5%. Another in Qadipur recorded just 53.12%, down from 99.7% in 2017, with 110 students getting a compartment result. A Sarvodaya School in Vijay Nagar also logged a pass percentage of 39, with 26 students of the 61 getting a compartment. At a girls’ school in Jahangirpuri, the pass percentage fell from 88 in 2017 to 29.9 this year.
 
  Sisodia nevertheless congratulated his teachers and education department for boosting the success percentage from 30 in pre-board exams to 69 in the main exams. “Would specially like to congratulate teachers and principals of   schools… Great work by the whole Team Education,” Sisodia tweeted.
 
 The minister also conceded that the going was tough for students with the board exams making a return after a long gap. “Many congratulations to all students who have passed the Class X CBSE Board exams. It was a tough year for all students as board exams were happening for the first time after 10 years,” he said on Twitter.
 
 The results seemed to have been foreseen in the pre-board exams in the Delhi government schools. The 991 secondary schools run by Delhi government had logged an average pass percentage of 31.5, with some schools going as low as 26 a month before the main exams. An alarmed Sisodia had asked the education directorate to act against teachers and principals of schools with low pass percentages, saying “there cannot be any justifiable reason for the schools being unable to support the learning of its students to the extent that not even 10 children are able to secure the minimum pass marks in each subject”.
 
 In comparison, the capital’s private schools fared much better with a success rate of 89.5%. Among the eight Amity Schools in in Delhi and NCR, 826 students out of 1,659 obtained over 90% aggregates, with the highest earned by students of Amity Noida. Delhi Public School, RK Puram, also recorded a high pass percentage of 99.
 
 Manav Rachna International School in Noida had a top aggregate of 96.4%, and all the students cleared the exams. Mount Abu School had a similar pass figure, with 10 of its 135 students scoring 100%. Manav Sthali School in Rajendra Nagar had 138 of its 443 students earning a distinction in all five subjects. While the top aggregate percentage at Ahlcon International was 97.4, Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, had 98.2 and The Indian School, 98.2.
