INDORE: Amending the affiliation by-laws, the   has brought back the mandatory   ( ) that the schools seeking provisional affiliation with the board will have to submit. 

 The schools seeking affiliation from the board will also have to get a formal prior recognition letter and NOC by the state education department for Class 1 to 5, 1 to 8 and 1 to 12. 
 
 However, the schools in the city are not happy with the latest amendment as school representatives feel that this change might lead to corruption. 
 
 "The board might have amended the by-laws in order to make sure that the state authorities recognise these schools before they apply for affiliation from the board but the major concern for the schools is that this might lead to corruption on every stage of approval," said a CBSE   from the city on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 However, the board had revoked this rule in 2013 in order to curb down corruption practices after receiving a number of complaints from various schools across the country about state education departments purposely delaying issuing of NOC certainly leading to incidences of bribery. 
 
 "With this the schools will have to take NOC from the state education department for recognition for Classes 1 to 5 required for middle class approval and recognition for Classes 1 to 8 required for provisional affiliation up to secondary level," said Jaydeb Kar,   helpline member from the state. 
 
 However, the circular released by the board stated that schools seeking affiliation shall also submit no objection certificate to the effect that state government has no objection to the affiliation of the school with CBSE.
