MUMBAI: In a victory for a consumer, a district   directed a   to refund the service charge it had “wrongly’’ charged him. The restaurant was directed to refund the service charge of Rs 3,002 with 9% interest since January 2018. Besides Rs 5,000 towards legal costs, it was also asked to shell out damages of Rs 5,000 for mental agony suffered by the customer.

 The restaurant management complied with the order and refunded the amount earlier this month. Ashwin  , a 43-year-old businessman, dragged the eatery to the Central Mumbai consumer forum over ‘deficiency of service’ faced when he visited Tamasha Restaurant last November.
 
 Vora said he and nine friends had ordered food and liquor and run up a bill of over Rs 35,000. It included Rs 3,000 ‘service charges’. Vora’s case was that the service charge was “illegally recovered’’ since restaurants are not supposed to levy it. “We spoke to the steward, but he refused to listen and asked us to recover it from the consumer court,” he said.Vora claimed a compensation of the bill amount of Rs 35,000 and Rs10,000 legal expenses.
