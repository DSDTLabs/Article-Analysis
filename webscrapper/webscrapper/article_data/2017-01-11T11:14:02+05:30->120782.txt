SURAT: The authorities have installed rainwater harvesting systems in 79 schools of Mandvi,   of Surat district to ensure that they don’t face acute   in future and to raise the   there. At least 30 schools in Olpad will also get rainwater harvesting systems as a follow up to the equipment’s installation at 10 primary health centres in the taluka.

 These talukas get good rainfall but the water doesn’t percolate through the soil. This is why many places in these talukas face acute water crisis during summer. 
 
 “We thought of installing rainwater harvesting systems in the schools and the primary health centres to ensure that at least here people don’t face shortage of water. This water is not suitable for drinking purpose but can be used for bathing and in the toilets etc. We plan to complete building 30 such systems in Olpad taluka before summer,” said K. Rajesh, district development officer (DDO), Surat.
 
 The rainwater harvesting system has a tank to store 250 litre while the remaining water will overflow into a 100-foot deep borewell. This water can be used only for toilet even as the process of chlorination by the administration would make it relatively purer. Surat district administration has spent Rs 1 lakh towards installation of each rainwater harvesting system.
