BIJNOR: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has fielded six Muslim candidates out of eight seats in the communally sensitive district of Bijnor. The party’s social engineering strategy, with an eye on Muslim and Dalit votes, will be tested in the district where 43% of the population is Muslim. Interestingly, the other two seats are reserved for scheduled caste candidates.
 
  According to BSP district president  , the party has fielded SP’s former district president and rebel Jameel Ansari from Najibabad seat, Virendra Pal from Nagina (SC) seat, Fahad Yajdani from Badapur, MLA Mohammad Gaji from Dhampur, Vivek Singh from Nahtaur (SC) seat,   from Bijnor, MLA Mohammad Iqbal from Chandpur and Gauhar Iqbal from Noorpur assembly seat.
  
  The moot point is that the BSP has believed in the Dalit-Muslim alliance in Bijnor. In the assembly election of 2012, the party had gone for five Muslim candidates, while two were Dalit and one from the Thakur community. Four BSP candidates had won of which three were Muslim, while SP and BJP had won in two seats.
  
  Each constituency in Bijnor has more than 1 lakh Muslim voters, and an additional 40,000-odd Dalit voters. The total number of voters across Bijnor is 25 lakh, with an average of 3 lakh in each seat.
  
  With all the political parties preparing the ground to fight it out on the campaign trail, a tough tussle is on the cards between the SP and the BSP to woo the sizeable fraction of Muslim voters. Despite the ongoing feud in the Yadav clan, the ruling SP has already declared its candidates, fielding four Muslims in the district.
  
  On the other hand BJP, Rashtriya Lok Dal and Congress have not announced any candidate. According to sources, RLD is gearing up for a pact with the SP, while the Congress and BJP are studying the strategies of other parties before declaring their respective candidates, although BJP’s western UP president   told TOI that his party will announce its candidates by January 10.
