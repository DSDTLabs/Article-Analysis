LUCKNOW: Three-time Lucknow mayor   has been “rewarded” for his patience. Unmindful of missed opportunities in the past, Sharma continued working silently as a trusted lieutenant of Narendra Modi and party president  . As national vice-president, Sharma is the in-charge of  , the home state of Modi and Shah and also of Haryana, where he was instrumental in the selection of Manohar Khattar as the chief minister. 

 Recalling the factors that led to the BJP’s landslide victory in the assembly polls, Sharma said opponents like   and   should focus on politics of performance and refrain from remarks like “Gujarat ke gadhey”. Opponents should have taken cue from Gujarat about development. Sharma said Akhilesh had himself sent a group of officials to Gujarat to review the river-front project to replicate in Lucknow. “The language you speak reflects your mindset and Akhilesh had exemplified his true self.”
 
 He said Akhilesh had sensed the looming defeat and offered more than 100 seats to deadwood Congress only as last resort. “Akhilesh kept asking about “acche din” which is self explanatory that he too agreed that things have not improved otherwise why should he ask such a question,” recalled Sharma, assuring politics of development in rescuing the state from BIMARU category.
 
 Sharma attributed the BJP’s victory to a nationwide wave in favour of the Centre’ policies like demonetisation. People supported the party and issues like note-ban as they were convinced about the intentions of the Prime Minister, he said. Opposition parties left no stone unturned to incite the public but they didn’t get any support and the entire campaign proved to be a flop. People conveyed a strong message that those opposing the ongoing cleansing campaign would pay the price. “We are hopeful of support from people of all walks and age groups,” he said.
