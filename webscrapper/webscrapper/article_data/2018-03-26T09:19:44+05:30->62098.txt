TRICHY: The Union governmentâ€™s reported move to set up a nine-member committee in response to the   order on the   dispute was an eye-wash,   leader Sarathkumar has alleged. It was a tactic of the Union government so as to keep the matter pending till the assembly elections in Karnataka were over, he opined. 

 Sarathkumar who began a tour from Mettur seeking the formation of Cauvery Management Board was slated to reach Mayiladuthurai on Sunday evening. Reacting to the statement of   state chief   on the information she received from the Centre on setting up the panel, Sarathkumar said that the Centre had so far done nothing to fulfil the order of the Supreme Court keeping in mind the assembly election in the neighbouring state.
 
 The ruling AIADMK government, as well as other opposition parties, should decide right now what would be the future course of action if the Centre failed to constitute CMB. It was not an issue of the delta alone, but of the whole state, he said. 
 
 Sarathkumar also expressed his support for those protesting against the   plant at Thoothukudi. Earlier, he spoke at various spots in Trichy including Chinthamani Anna Statue and Gandhi Market on the way to Thanjavur as part of his campaign.
