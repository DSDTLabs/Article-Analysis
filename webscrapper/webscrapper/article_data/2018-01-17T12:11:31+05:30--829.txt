BHUBANESWAR: The  's first   (MLCP) will soon be a reality. The authorities have started construction of the MLCP at  . Once completed, it will house around 250 cars. 

 Erratic parking is a headache for the civic authorities. The MLCP is expected to ease snarls on the Janpath to a large extent. The project will be completed in a year. It is one of the high-priority schemes and will go hand-in-hand with the Smart Janpath project.
 
 "We have started digging earth to erect pillars. Since the design is ready, the work will not take much time. We expect it to be ready before the Men's Hockey World Cup," said an officer.
 
 Officials said the Saheed Nagar MLCP will be spread over less than an acre to facilitate the construction of a basement and four floors. "According to the plan, some space has been left at the parking site for commercial use such as office building, shopping and food arcade so that the Bhubaneswar Smart City Limited can generate revenue from it," added the officer.
 
 Notably, the MLCP will be integrated with the   (ICOMC), an IT-backed command centre that is meant for integrating all IT-driven operations to be taken up under the Smart City Mission. "The benefit of integrating the MLCP with the ICOMC is that people can book parking space for their cars in advance," officials said.
 
 Official sources said prevailing building norms will be taken into account while constructing the MLCP. It will have accessibility compliance and provision for rooftop solar power. "Besides, the building will be erected in such a way as to retain the aesthetics of the temple city. Since the city is a cyclone-prone zone, the MLCP will be climate-resistant," said an officer.
