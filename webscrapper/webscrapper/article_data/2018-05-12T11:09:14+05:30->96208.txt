COIMBATORE: The city police have questioned two members of the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam ( ) and as many from the Tamilar Vidiyal Katchi (TVK) in connection with setting   district president CR Nandakumar’s sports utility vehicle (SUV) on fire. 

 On March 21 morning, two unidentified men poured petrol on the SUV, which was parked at his s house at   in Peelamedu, set it on fire and quickly escaped. Its front portion was damaged. 
 
 The duo also burned the rear portion of an SUV of a businessman at   on the same day. The two incidents were reported after a statue of Periyar EV Ramasamy was vandalised in Pudukottai district.
 
 The city police, despite forming five special teams, couldn’t trace the suspects. They collected footages from more than 200 CCTV cameras, but they could not make out the registration number of the two-wheeler rode by the suspects as the footages were unclear. 
 
 Meanwhile, two days ago, the city police picked up two TPDK members - Vinodh of New Siddhapudur and Manoj of Saravanampatti - and as many TVK members -   from Saravanampatti and another one - in connection with the case.
 
 The police had been questioning them since then. They didn’t allow Naveen’s parents to meet him. 
 
 As the outfits were planning to file a habeas corpus petition before the Madras high court against the illegal detention of Naveen, the police released all the four on Friday night.
 
 The police said they have asked the four to appear before them for investigation, whenever required. 
 
 The general secretary of TPDK Ku Ramakrishnan said the youth were innocent. “We had told the police not to harass them and to find the real culprits,” he said.
