GUWAHATI:   is eyeing the top prize at the 69th Republic Day parade for its tableau on Majuli, which will feature the famous mask dance or 'mukha silpi' of the island. The 2014 tableau with Bhupen Hazarika as its theme had won the second prize at the parade and the   tableau in 2016 had won the third prize. This will be the fourth consecutive time that Assam is being selected to display its tableaux at the New Delhi parade. 

 This year's theme on Majuli got a thumbs up by the ministry of defence after several trials. Ten mask performers from Samaguri in Majuli under the watchful eyes and direction of mask master Hem Goswami will be vying for the top prize. "We are rehearsing and working real hard. The mask performance is an intrinsic part of the island culture depicting scenes from the epic, the Ramayana. Sita, Jatayu, Ravan, Bali and Sugriva are some of the characters that the performers will be enacting," said Khagen Goswami, troop leader.
 
 The tableaux will be 48 ft long, 16 ft in height and have a breadth of 14 ft. The 10 performers will render the Bhaona scenes atop this. Sattriya music will complete the island's cultural representation. "Getting selected by the ministry of defence was a huge challenge. The entire process comprises trials, modifications and meetings. The artists come from a place famed for its tradition," said JN Senapati of Image Creation, the firm associated with the tableaux design.
 
 The performers will have exactly 65 seconds as the float rolls down the Rajpath to unfurl their native culture and win over hearts.
