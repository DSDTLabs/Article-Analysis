NEW DELHI: BJP and Swaraj India have alleged that the State Election Commission (SEC) has rejected the nominations of several candidates on "frivolous grounds". 

 While Swaraj India staged a protest outside SEC's office on Thursday, BJP met LG Anil Baijal and alleged that the AAP government was putting pressure on SEC officials to reject nominations of its candidates. The commission has rejected nominations of 24 Swaraj India and six BJP candidates.
 
 "Delhi government is making all possible efforts to trouble us," said Kuljeet Chahal, general secretary of Delhi BJP. Earlier, BJP spokesperson and MP Meenakshi Lekhi told state election commissioner S K Srivastava that the nomination of the Trilokpuri candidate had been rejected as she didn't fill up the gender column. Similarly, in Vinod Nagar, the nomination was rejected as the candidate did not sign a document.
 
  Swaraj India's Yogendra Yadav also met Srivastava with the rejected candidates. "Despite assurance from SEC, no returning officer is ready to review illegal rejection of candidates. Who is running this elections?" he tweeted later. A senior SEC official said all returning officers were given basic guidelines for scrutinising the papers.
