SECUNDERABAD: The   (SCB) has mopped up nearly Rs 31 crore   and are now concentrating on collecting the pending Rs 16.36 crore tax from the   airport, which is the biggest defaulter in the   jurisdiction. 

 SCB authorities served a ‘Red Notice’ in February to the Airport Authority of India, Begumpet, to pay the property tax and gave them a month’s time. “Till now, no reply has come from them on payment of property tax of Rs 16.36 crore, which is long pending. The notice period is over and at any moment, the airport property will be sealed and attached,” a senior SCB tax wing official told TOI. 
 
 According to SCB records, there are 46,000 tax payers (property owners), including individual and commercial establishments in the cantonment. The process of serving ‘Red Notices’ to defaulters was carried out for five months till March 31 to collect property tax dues of nearly Rs 15 crore. In November, defaulters paid nearly Rs 9 crore in old notes following demonetisation, the official said. 
 
 “We collected nearly Rs 1 crore more when compared to last year’s property tax collection. In 2015-16, we collected Rs 30 crore as tax,” an SCB official said.
 
 In March, SCB authorities conducted raids on commercial establishments like shops, hospitals and educational institutions and sealed many properties for non-payment of tax. Scared about possible action, many property owners paid their dues. “If the Begumpet Airport authorities pay Rs 16.36 property tax dues, our revenue will go up to Rs 47 crore, which would be the highest collection in Cantonment history,” said an official in the tax department.
