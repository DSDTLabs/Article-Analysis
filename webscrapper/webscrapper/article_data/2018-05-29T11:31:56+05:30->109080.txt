CHANDIGARH: Amid the intense attack of the Opposition parties, BJP’s   MP   on Monday accused the   of creating a social divide.

 In a media briefing held at Panchkula, Kataria listed the incidents in which Congress had been supporting the accused in the Dalit-related incidents in the past.
 
 “You list out the incidents and you shall find that more Dalit families, boys and girls have fallen prey to the upper castes. Let Congress leaders give an incident wherein they helped Dalits. What they are doing is for political gains and all this will go in vain,” said Kataria.
 
 Besides having planned the night stays at the residences of Dalits in their localities, Kataria said he would spend days in all the Dalit-dominated areas to look into their grievances.
 
 “Our idea is to reach out to all at the booth level. The district and block units have been given adequate instructions and our campaign will start from Tuesday,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, referring to development woks in Ambala parliamentary constituency and Panchkula (urban) assembly constituency, Kataria listed the expansion plans of railway station, setting up of NIFD and proposed inaugration of AAYUSH University, and a national-level research centre of ayurveda in Mansa Devi Complex of Panchkula.
 
 Prominent among those who accompanied Kataria included Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta and media head Virender Garg.
