NOIDA: Residents of various apartment complexes in   have decided to move the   against the problem of open garbage dumps in the Sector 138-140 region.

 The residents said that dumpers were fetching garbage from across the city — including industrial waste from the SEZ regions — to pile them in the area. Saying that the dumping of garbage could in course of time lead to water table contamination, residents have organised a protest on Saturday during which they would form a human chain and prevent the dumpers from reaching the spot.
 
 “Residents in the apartments across the street can’t keep their balcony doors open because of the stench. We have taken our complaints to the   but to no avail. We will now approach the NGT to get a case registered against this dumping,” V V S Rao, a resident of Sector 137, said.
 
 “We will form a human chain to prevent the dumpers from reaching here. Not just we, but local villagers have also complained about this practice. This is a health hazard as there are various plastic and other toxic wastes. The heap is growing and will soon become like the Ghazipur landfill site if left unchecked,” Ankur Arora, a resident, said.
 
 The temporary   yard in the region was created by the   Authority two years ago. The Authority was supposed to transfer its solid waste to Astoli, a spot identified for garbage recycling, 50km away from Noida.
