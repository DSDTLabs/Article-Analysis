DHARWAD: Social activist   warned that he would launch an agitation against state government’s decision to appoint former retired Judge P Vishwanath Shetty as  .

 “I will consult freedom fighter H S Doreswamy on Wednesday before launching the agitation,” Hiremath told reporters in Dharwad immediately after the committee headed by chief minister Siddaramaiah finalized Justice Shetty’s name.
 
 “By deciding to recommend Justice Shetty‘s name for the post, the government has belittled the importance of this Constitutional body. Chief minister Siddaramaiah has betrayed the people of the state by selecting   who owns multiple properties in Bengaluru. It is unfortunate that the Assembly speaker and the leaders of the Opposition are also party to this decision,'' he added. 
 
 Hiremath alleged that Justice Shetty has a bungalow in R T Nagar in Bengaluru, a site in Judicial Layout and properties in many places and claimed that he has documents to substantiate these allegations.
