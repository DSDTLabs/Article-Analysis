The BJP came to power but towed the same line, and once again, we have achieved what we had promised. The Goan electorate is sending out signals that no one should play with its sentiments. This BJP defeat is higher in intensity then what the Congress faced in 2012. Government machinery was used profusely to harass BBSM supporters including interfering in education institutes and attempts to take away government jobs from relatives of our supporters. Money power was also used, and yet, the BJP was defeated. 
 
 If the exit polls turned out to be accurate in the case of all other states except that of Goa, it is only because the BJPâ€™s central leadership seems to have gone entirely with whatever information Parrikar fed them about the situation prevailing here. Parrikar should accept this defeat as a moral defeat for him. At the Vijay Sankalp rally in Mala, Panaji, Parrikar told the people that if Sidharth Kuncalienker loses even a single vote since the last elections in Panaji, Parrikar would admit it to be his personal defeat. And Kuncalienker has now lost a huge chunk of his votes. 
 
 
 
 
 MGP is an independent party. It is free to take its own decisions. Alhough we had a pre-poll alliance, the GSM has not won any seat so the question of the MGP consulting GSM MLAs does not arise.
 
 
 
 
 GSM was sure of winning at least two seats: Curchorem and Sakhali. That is why we suspect foul play. We had clearly calculated the votes in these two constituencies and they were in our favour. Yet the Curchorem MLA ended up winning, and with a huge margin.
