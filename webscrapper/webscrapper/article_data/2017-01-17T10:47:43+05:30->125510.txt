AMARAVATI: Challenging the state government, the   (CRFF) has served legal notices to top officials of the government, including  , to immediately stop the   in the capital region.

 The federation said they were left with no option but to approach the court as removal of power supply lines was jeopardising farming operations. Although   (SPDCL) took the decision to snap all agriculture connections in the capital city area almost a year ago, the on-field process started only recently .
 
 Farmers alleged that the removal of distribution and transmission relay (DTR) lines would put an end to cultivation, forcing the farmers to give up their lands to the CRDA. “The officials of power utilities are deliberately dismantling the lines, hoping this will scare us away .Land pooling scheme (LPS) is optional, and so stopping power supply amounts to terrorising those who did not join it,“ fumed CRFF president Mallela Seshagiri Rao. He further said not a single farmer, who did not wish to give up land, had yielded to the pressure tactics employed by the government.
 
 The farmers from riverbank villages have been opposing the LPS and resisted several attempts of the government from taking over their fields. Vexed with the farmers' opposition to LPS, the state government recently decided to invoke the Land Acquisition Act. As a first measure to stop farmers from cultivating, the power utilities started dismantling the supply lines.
