GURUGRAM: The CBI is likely to file its supplementary chargesheet in the Bhondsi   case in the sessions court on Tuesday, which could bring up to the fore the role of Gurugram police in “botching up” the preliminary investigation.

 A 7-year-old boy was found with his throat slit just outside the school washroom on September 8, 2017. The police theory was that a bus conductor of the school, Ashok, had tried to sexually assault the boy in the washroom and killed him when he resisted.
 
 However, on February 5, CBI, which was asked to take up the probe after protests, filed its preliminary chargesheet in which they detailed the role of a juvenile in the murder, as well as the events that led to it, and gave a clean chit to Ashok. The court, while discharging Ashok of all charges, instructed CBI to complete its investigation and file a supplementary chargesheet by April 10. 
 
 CBI’s preliminary chargesheet had made several claims that contradicted the police probe. Besides exonerating Ashok — the prime accused according to police — it also accused police of pressuring several witnesses to give statements that fit their theory, as well as of torturing and harassing Ashok and other witnesses. CBI also said that despite police questioning the juvenile who they have charged with the murder, police investigators didn’t bother to make him a ‘person of interest’, raising serious doubts about the probe by their special investigation team (SIT).
 
 CBI also claimed Ashok had confessed to police of the murder under “coercion and threat by investigators”. The SIT’s sexual assault theory also fell flat after no semen samples were detected on the boy’s underwear and body in the FSL repor.
 
 Following CBI’s preliminary chargesheet, police commissioner   had said, “Any investigation agency speaks through its chargesheet. Our process was very much in its initial stages, though it had reached some conclusions.”
