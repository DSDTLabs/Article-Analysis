VADODARA: The   (ACB) filed an affidavit in the sessions court opposing the bail application of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’s founder   Shah on Tuesday.

 Several details of investigations cropped up in affidavit that agency submitted to the court. 
 
 ACB said that call detail records of Shah and aide Vinod alias Bharat Savant show that duo were in constant touch with each other before and after the trap. Also audio recording of the call between the complainant and the accused reveals the alleged offence of demanding and receiving of money.
 
 The agency during investigations found Shah’s identity card of the university in which Shah is designated as the chancellor of the university. The agency on the basis of this evidence told the court that as chancellor, Shah comes under the definition of a public servant. However, they also told that at the stage of bail application it is not necessary to decide on it. The agency mentioned in the affidavit that two FIRs of cheating were also registered against him at Dabhoi police station in 2006 and 2007. In both the cases, Shah had allegedly taken lakhs of rupees from the complainants promising admission of their daughters in   but, did not admit them as promised.
 
 Apart from these FIRs, two applications to register cases against Shah were also made by a resident of Surendranagar and a resident of Banaskantha. It was alleged that Shah had taken money for admission to MBBS course but, the admission was given in a dental course. ACB requested the court that his bail plea be rejected because there are possibilities that Shah will try to influence the witnesses by threatening them.
