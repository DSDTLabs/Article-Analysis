After a wait of more than two decades,  's veteran   finally laid his hands on a Golden Globe trophy, as the filmmaker was announced the 'Best Director' (Motion Picture) at the star-studded ceremony.

  The 53-year-old filmmaker won the award for his Cold War fantasy,   and he was not about to let the orchestra ruin his moment.
 
  
  
  He started by saying, "Lower the music. It's taken 25 years. Give me a minute. Give me a minute!"
 
  He continued, "For 25 years I have handcrafted very strange little tales made of motion, color, light and shadow. In three precise instances, these strange stories, these fables, have saved my life. Once with 'Devil's Backbone', once with 'Pan's Labyrinth', and now with 'Shape of Water', because as directors, these things are not just entries in a filmography. We have made a deal with a particularly inefficient devil that trades three years of our lives for one entry on IMDb. And these things are biography and they are alive."
 
  While talking about his attraction towards monsters, he noted, "Since childhood I've been faithful to monsters. I've been saved and absolved by them because monsters are the patron saints of our blissful imperfections."
 
  The filmmaker beat out all male nominees, which included Martin McDonagh for 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri',   for 'Dunkirk', Ridley Scott for 'All the Money in the World', and   for 'The Post'.
 
  The category's nominees drew criticism for its all-male field of contenders and notable snubs of   and Jordan Peele, both making their directorial debuts this year, for their critically acclaimed films   and  , respectively.
 
  Natalie Portman, who presented the awards, also noted the lack of female nominees in her introduction.
