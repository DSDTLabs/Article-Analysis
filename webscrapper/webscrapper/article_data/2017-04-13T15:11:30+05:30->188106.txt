NAGPUR: City writer-director, Subodh Nagdeve’s film ‘Bole India Jai Bhim’ has finally got clearance from   on Monday and is now ready to be released on April 14. The film ran into trouble with the   as it is based on the life of Babu Hardas LN, a follower of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, who is credited for coining the phrase ‘Jai Bhim’.

 “An undertaking has been taken from us saying that Censor Board will not be responsible if any unlawful situation or incident is created due to this film. We have also submitted a DVD to them in which the disclaimer -- compulsory for films based on historical incidents under rule 33 -- is shown for the entire duration of the film,” said Nagdeve.
 
 The CBFC was not giving permission as it felt “the movie would vitiate the social environment”. The film was originally made in Marathi and was released in October 2016. “We have dubbed it in Hindi and were planning to release it in Nagpur and other regions of Vidarbha on April 7 and in Hindi-speaking states on April 14 to coincide with the 126th anniversary of Babasaheb,” says Nagdeve.
 
 The CBFC’s delay in giving clearance has put Nagdeve in a spot. “When we were to release it on April 7 we were getting 35 screens all over the CPCI circuit, which includes places in Vidarbha,   and Chhattisgarh. But, now, there are other big movies like Begum Jaan and Fast Furious which are also releasing on Friday. As a result, we have got only 14 screens, four of them in Nagpur,” he said.
 
 Nagdeve adds that earlier he was getting 35 screens on a percentage basis but now he has to hire theatres on a weekly rental.
 
 “The entire economics has gone awry as theatres charge over a lakh as rental which a filmmaker like me cannot afford,” he said.
 
 Made on a budget of Rs 50 lakh, the film has a local cast and has been shot in and around the city.
