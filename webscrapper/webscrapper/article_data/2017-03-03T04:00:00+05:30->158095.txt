Gandhinagar: Congress MLA from Rajkot city, Indranil Rajyaguru, who for last several years holds a   on health ground, moved a resolution in the state assembly on Thursday demanding stricter prohibition and better control of the law and order situation. However his resolution was not accepted by BJP and the minister of state (MOS), home, Pradipsinh Jadeja, countered his claims of poor law and order.

 Rajyaguru, who has announced contesting elections against current chief minister Vijay Rupani, who is also the MLA from Rajkot city, candidly accepted in the state assembly during his speech that he has a liquor permit and regularly consumes liquor. 
 
 Rajyaguru said, “I am not showing hypocrisy. I had a liquor permit before I became an MLA. I have nothing to hide. The minister of state(MOS), home, himself has said in the house that if police searches MLA quarters then also they will find liquor. There cannot be exception for MLAs.”
 
 “Though the government makes claims of strict prohibition, in Rajkot or in any part of the state, liquor is available on just one phone call,” said Rajyaguru. “There is need to have stricter prohibition in the state as it’s directly related to crime. Due to poor prohibition, crimes like loot, murder, rape etc., have increased,” Rajyaguru added. He also said that Bihar has now better law and order than Gujarat.
 
 Pradipsinh Jadeja, minister of state (MOS), home, said that, “Liquor is a big social evil, so to save the society, strict prohibition law has been introduced. No one will be spared under the new law.”
 
 “There are enough strict provisions in the new prohibition Act to deter bootleggers. Compared to all other states, law and order situation in Gujarat is far better and that’s why investment from across the world is coming to the state,” Jadeja added.
