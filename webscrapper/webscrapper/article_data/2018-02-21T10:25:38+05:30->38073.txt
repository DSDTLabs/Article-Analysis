BEED: His home is a tiny hut lined with dried sheaves of jowar. There are barely any utensils and just one charpoy. Octogenarian farmer Mehboobkhan Pathan’s most precious possession is his loan waiver certificate.

 Four months ago, on the eve of Diwali,   made it to the first list of beneficiaries of the   government’s loan waiver scheme for farmers.
 
 
 “My wife and I were invited to the   collector’s office for a grand ceremony on October 18, and I got a certificate promising me a waiver of Rs 47,908,” said Pathan, who has a tiny 1.5-acre farm in   village in Marathwada’s Beed district.
 
 Only, the waiver has not materialized till date for one of its earliest intended beneficiaries. Last week, Fadnavis had announced that the waiver disbursals should be completed by February 15.
 
 By now Pathan is bitter. “This loan waiver is a farce. It is a fasvi(deceptive)karzmaafi,” he said. He approached the local branch of the   (DCCB) numerous times, with no luck. “They tell me I have to put money into the account before getting the loan,” he said.
 
 The state’s loan waiver has been dogged by complications and delays from the start. Initially, the government said the waiver would benefit 89 lakh farmers. Later, the number of applications fell to 69 lakh.
