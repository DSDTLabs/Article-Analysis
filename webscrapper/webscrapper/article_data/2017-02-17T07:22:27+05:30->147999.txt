KOCHI: Human interference in nature is creating a lot of disturbance even in the  , fisheries experts opined.

 “Fishes which were earlier found only in deep sea are now getting caught from backwaters. Oil   and even marine creatures like Octopus have found their way into the   because of the higher salinity in the waters. Vembanadu lake has shrunk to one-third of what it was about a 100 years ago,” said Kerala university of fisheries sciences (Kufos) vice-chancellor A Ramachandran.
 
 He said that the fresh water sources have begun to dry up in the land and with the fall in water levels, the sea is pushing into the land. “On the other hand, we are reclaiming wetlands which is having a bearing on the land temperatures,” he said.
 
 “Even as countries in the Gulf are building artificial lakes, we are going out of way to kill the existing fresh water bodies which is in turn generating lot of heat on the land. This is one of the reasons why there is an increase in land temperature,” Ramachandran said.
 
 The university, which is adopting panchayats for providing training in fish cultivation, found increase in salinity when the waters were tested for quality. “We are training farmers in aquaculture. When we adopt a panchayat, we test the waters for quality and its suitability for the selected fish species,” said  , director of extension.
 
 Kufos is organizing its third convocation ceremony on Saturday. 
 
 Governor Justice P Sathasivam and fisheries minister   will be the chief guests at the function to be held at the campus.
