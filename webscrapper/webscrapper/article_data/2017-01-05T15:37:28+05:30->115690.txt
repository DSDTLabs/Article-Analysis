NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of   on Wednesday commuted the   of an accused doctor to six years.

 Sakoli-based medico Rajendra Kapgate was convicted by the Nagpur sessions court for allegedly killing his brother-in-law Prashant Nakade on February 2, 2011. He was convicted on December 31, 2014, which he challenged in the higher judiciary through senior counsel Avinash Gupta, along with Aakash Gupta and VJ Gupta.
 
 Sameer Sonwane pleaded for the deceased’s family. 
 
 Kapgate was upset with Nakade for not sending his sister, Neeta, back to him after she left home following a tiff with husband. Nakade was shot twice, leading to his death in a car outside a marriage venue near Pardi Naka.
 
 The case was listed before a division bench comprising justices Bhushan Gavai and Indira Jain, who partly allowed Kapgate’s appeal. The accused has been in custody since 2011, barring a very short period for which he was released on bail.
