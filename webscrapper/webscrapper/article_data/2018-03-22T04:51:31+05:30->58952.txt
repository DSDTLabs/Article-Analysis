The   on Wednesday summoned Maharashtra DGP   and asked him to appear before it to explain the failure of law-enforcement officials to unearth systematic channels of human trafficking in the state, which came to light after 68 girls, including 18 minors, were rescued from a red light area of Shahada, Nandurbar, in January last year.

 Abench of Justice J Chelameswar and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul expressed dissatisfaction over the probe conducted by the state police, which contended that all girls had “confessed” that they had gone there on their own and no other person was involved in human trafficking.
 
  
 The court asked the DGP to appear before it on April 3. The court said all the girls are from a particular community and come from six districts of Rajasthan and it showed that there might be a well-established channel under which they were being taken and pushed into flesh trade.
 
 “How can you not see what is happening behind the scenes. It is troubling us how you are conducting the probe. There must be some channel through which these girls were taken to Maharashtra and you should find out who are the persons behind it,” the bench said.
 
 The court passed the order on a petition filed by an NGO, Rescue Foundation, which pleaded the court to intervene to protect the interests of the minor girls who were rescued last year but were handed over to their guardians without following due procedure of law.
 
 Advocate Abhishek Bharti, appearing for the NGO, submitted that proper inquiry should have been conducted before handing over the custody to “so-called” guardians to safeguard the interests of the minors.
