Those stepping into a mall in the heart of the city recently were in for a surprise, as they spotted some of their favourite K-Town stars in person. The celebrities had come together to attend the launch of a lounge, and were seen meeting and greeting each other with much enthusiasm. While   and Veer looked picture perfect together, Christelda and Vivek struck a fun pose for our photog. We spotted Sonia Agarwal at the console, getting DJ Vijay Chawla to play her favourite music.   killed it in an animal-print dress, and Jyotiâ€™s balloon-sleeved sequinned top gave us major fashion goals. Girl gang Madhu, Juhi, Prajanya and Priyanka got the house down with their fun banter, and Pawan, dressed in one-shoulder black number, spelt classic chic. Vishnu Vishal, Vaibhav, Karunakaran, Pushkar-Gayatri, Krish, Priya, Sidney, Akhil, Dinesh, Ramya, Santhosh Prathap and   were among those who were spotted at the do.
