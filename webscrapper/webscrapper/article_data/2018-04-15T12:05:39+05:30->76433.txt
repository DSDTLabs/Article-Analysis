 Number of suicides have increased in the recent years, especially when results are around the corner. A Guntur girl’s recent suicide highlights the situation which needs to be addressed immediately.  , a native of Srungarapuram under Bapatla mandal in Guntur district, committed suicide after she failed in the intermediate examination. Peer pressure, extreme competition, socio-economic conditions and forced aspirations of parents are driving students to take the extreme steps.
 
 Noted psychiatrist Dr Vishal Indla says, “Parents hold the primary responsibility in containing this ominous trend. The problem begins when parents start to compare their children with other kids. Soon, the children consider themselves to be failures.”
 
 The aggressive marketing strategies of corporate colleges is also creating a sense of insecurity among students say experts. “Glorification of few ranks hurts the morale of many students who missed out due to small margins. Ranks are not the right way to measure one’s potential. We have numerous examples of rankers failing in the latter part of their education. At the same time those who failed in their initial part of education have become successful,” Indla says.
 
 Experts suggest that the parents should stand by their kids and say say it is okay to fail. Parents should not hesitate to take help from the professionals.
