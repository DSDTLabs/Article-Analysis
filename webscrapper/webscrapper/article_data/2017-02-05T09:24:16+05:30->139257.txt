HYDERABAD: The latest traffic volume survey conducted by the   has zeroed in on Kothaguda, Botanical Garden, Biodiversity, Khajaguda, Cyber Towers,   as some of the most congested intersections in the  . 

 According to data collected by the traffic police, these junctions witness slow movement of traffic and long-winding traffic jams throughout the day, even during non-peak hours, on a daily basis. A look at the movement of traffic at the   from October last year to January 2016, for instance, shows how a 'traffic jam' forms at the junction, even between 12 pm and 1 pm. The situation is no different at the heavily congested Biodiversity junction, where peak-hour traffic moved at a snail's pace for 43 out of 52 days in the past four months.
 
 Results of the survey come as no surprise to many who regularly cross these junctions during their daily commute.
 
 "The metro work has severely affected flow of traffic in the Madhapur region. Getting stuck in traffic jams has almost become a daily occurrence, which is why I now leave an hour early for all my appointments," said techie Suman Thummala.
 
 The Cyberabad police will soon kick off a slew of measures to increase the mobility on roads cutting through the IT belt, by nearly 15 per cent.
 
 "The plan is to widen the curvature at U-turns and ensure that the 'free left' turnings are not blocked, by obstructions or by other vehicles. We will start heavily penalising vehicle owners who are found blocking these left turns. These will first be implemented at the Biodiversity junction, on an experimental basis. Within a month, this junction will be the model junction, based on which we will implement the same measures at other points," said A R Srinivas, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Traffic, Cyberabad. 
 
 A few other congested junctions, identified by the traffic police, include IIIT junction, Wipro Circle,  , Hitex Junction and 100 feet road junction.
