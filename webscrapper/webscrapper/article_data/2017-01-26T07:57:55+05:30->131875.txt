NEW DELHI: The   has again postponed the   to the allottees of its   despite   orders. In a public notice on Wednesday, DDA said it needed a year to develop the sectors where the plots were to be allotted to nearly 14,500 people.

 The allottees want DDA to give land in semi-developed areas in other parts of the city as they have been waiting for the past 36 years. However, DDA said that it was not possible as the   land was acquired specially for that scheme.
 
 “On account of certain acquisition/compensation isssues raised by the villagers of Barwala, the work of providing basic amenities/services in sectors 34 (pocket C5, C6, and A4) 35, 36, 37 and 38 was held up. Consequent to the Supreme Court’s direction, the development work of these sectors has since been recommenced and would take a year to get completed,” the notice stated.
 
 “DDA is misleading people. They were supposed to hand over the plots in July 2016, but have failed to develop the areas. Most sectors where plots have been allotted have no basic facilities. We have waited for a long time already. Now, we want land elsewhere in Rohini and nearby areas,” said Rahul Gupta, petitioner and one of the allottees.
 
 There were 25,500 allottees of the scheme. Of these, 11,000 were allotted plots in 2015. The Supreme Court had asked DDA to allot plots to the remaining 14,500 by July 31, 2016.
 
 Land was acquired in sectors 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38 in 2006-07, but couldn’t be developed due to resistance from Barwala villagers, an official said. 
 
 But Gupta said, “Several original allottees have passed away and the remaining ones are senior citizens. How long do people have to wait?”
