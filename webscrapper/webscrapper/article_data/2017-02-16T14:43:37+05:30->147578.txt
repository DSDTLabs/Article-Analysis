CHENNAI: An hour after   Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao appointed   – a loyalist of party general secretary VK Sasikala -- as chief minister, rebel leader O   on Thursday vowed to continue his protest till truth wins.

 Panneerselvam said party members and the general public are angry at Governor inviting the Sasikala faction to form government based on the numbers shown in paper. “The truth is that MLAs are held captive in a resort and not allowed to come out of the resort,” he said. 
 
 “Party members and public wonder whether a government can be formed by people who are accused of responsible for the death of former chief minister J  ,” Panneerselvam told media at his residence soon after invited Edappadi Palaniswami to form government.
 
 Panneerselvam thanked the partymen who have been supporting him since he sat on the memorial of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa on February 7. He enthused them by stating that the ‘dharma yudh’ would continue.
 
 “The party founded by M G Ramachandran and grown Amma cannot be left with a family and our struggle to retrieve the party will continue,” said Panneerselvam. He said all the true cadre of the party and general public were his strength.
 
 This protest was started only to prevent the party from changing hands to a few persons of a family. “The protest will continue to safeguard the sacrifices of MGR and Amma for the sake of party. I take a vow in the name of Amma that I will win the peaceful protest to retrieve the party,” he said.
