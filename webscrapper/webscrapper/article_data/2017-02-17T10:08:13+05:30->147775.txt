PATNA: Maharaja J S Gaekwad of the erstwhile royal family of Baroda, who inaugurated the eight-day Bodhisattva International   at   here on Thursday, praised   for organising the event on such a large scale in Bihar.

 “Our forefathers have always patronised art and theatre festivals. As a result, Baroda has become a popular destination for filmmakers in the country,” said Gaekwad. State art and culture minister Shiv Chandra Ram, actor-turned-politician  , film and television actor Akhilendra Mishra, Padmashri Sharda Sinha and Sneha Routray, president of Grameen Sneh Foundation (GSF), were also present at the inaugural function.
 
 Shatrughan, who too spoke on the occasion, said in a lighter vein, “I am here not to talk about ‘Mann ki baat’, but ‘Dil ki baat’. I am product of cinema and have earned name and fame through cinema. The international film festival will lead to growth, progress and protection of cinema.” Shatrughan also recalled actor Om Puri who passed away recently. “There are very few actors in the country like Om Puri,” he said. 
 
 Acknowledging the support to artists since ages by royal families, Sharda Sinha said the state government should also take steps to promote art and culture.
 
 On Friday, different films will be screened as part of the festival. The films include Ringan (Marathi), Dolachal (Bengali), Pounopunik (Bengali), Until Space Remains (English), Mathilukal (Malayalam), Lina (Persian), Under Construction (Bengali), Antarjali Yatra (Bengali), Blank Page (Russian), Dying Dreams (Sinhala), Floating Seed (English), Sex in the City (English) and The White Box (Romanian and English).
