KOLHAPUR: A faulty development process leads to protests nationwide and to end this agitation, all sections of society should ensure progress takes place in a transparent and more inclusive manner. Social activist   made this statement at a book release function in the city on Saturday. 

 Chaudhari was addressing a large audience gathered for the book release of ‘Kolhapurcha Toll Ladha’, which literally translates to ‘Toll Battle of Kolhapur’ penned by author Vishwas Patil. Eminent economist J F Patil, lawyer  , architect   and convener of the anti-toll agitation Nivas Salokhe were present for the book release function held at Shahu Smarak Bhavan.
 
 The book is based on the agitations that rocked the city between 2011 and 2016 with a demand for cancellation of toll collection. A private company hired by the   Municipal Corporation (KMC) had started collecting the toll after it laid a 49-km stretch of roads on a public-private-partnership (PPP) basis. Slain activist   and veteran leader   had led the agitations, which forced the government to stop the toll collection and cancel the project.
 
 Chaudhuri said that after 1991, the concept of toll tax emerged that ultimately led to crony capitalism and rampant corruption. “The development process is faulty which the major cause for agitations is. Many countries in the world have developed standards in the development process which has reduced the agitations. Protests on roads are as important as the decisions taken in Parliament. I think activists and agitators have more responsibility than the legislatures,” Chaudhari said.
