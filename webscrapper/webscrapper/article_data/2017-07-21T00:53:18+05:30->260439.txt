MUMBAI: Now, you can catch any tout on camera and submit the mobile clip to   which will forward it to local police for prompt action. This is part of a drive launched by state transport commissioner Praveen Gedam to free all RTOs of unscrupulous touts/agents. 

 The RTO officials themselves are doing ‘sting operations’ and catching   using hidden cameras. After handing over a tout to Tardeo police on Wednesday, the RTO officials made clips of two more touts whose details were being passed on to the police, a senior official informed TOI on Thursday. 
 
 Said Gedam, “Citizens should fearlessly complain to the RTO or to the anti-corruption bureau (in case any official is demanding bribe). There will be zero tolerance in such cases.” 
 
 The drive has angered a section of agents who said they were not doing anything “illegal”. “We have got permission from the high court to work for citizens, provided we have an authority letter. In such cases, the RTO should not object,” said an agent. A few agents threatened to agitate or move the court if there was any kind of further “harassment” from the RTO staff. 
 
 A transport officer complained that work at RTOs will suffer if officials were deployed for the ‘sting operations.’ “All city RTOs are short staffed . If we have officials chasing touts and getting them arrested, we will not have staff for the regular work,” he pointed out.
 
 The officer suggested that the best solution to the problem will be introducing compulsory online payment of fees at the time of application. 
 
 There are boards with helpline numbers and website details put up in   for the citizens to file a complaint.
