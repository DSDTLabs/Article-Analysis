 Turns out, Virat is anything but tensed. Ahead of the India vs England  , scheduled to kick-off in Pune, Virat visited the city and even spoke about his new role in the team, in a session moderated by actress Mandira Bedi. “I look at it (the captaincy) as a responsibility that I will handle to the best of my abilities. There’s no pressure involved,” said the captain, who is currently among the top-three batsmen in the three formats of the game.
 
 
 
 Maybe there’s no pressure but is it a difficult task to lead a team that also has players senior to him? “I often hear people asking this question, thinking it’s a big deal captaining seniors. I always tell them that they should see the dressing room atmosphere once. It’s one of the most chilled-out places,” added the skipper.
 
  
  
 
 
 With great responsibility comes grey hair; neither Barack Obama nor MS could evade the increasing ‘salt’ in their manes. Virat isn’t an exception. The youngster confessed to having more grey hair in his   post taking on captaincy, but maintained it was a part and parcel of the responsibility. He even shared a valuable piece of advice from the ‘God of Cricket’ Sachin Tendulkar. “The best cricketing advice I got was from my hero, Sachin Tendulkar. He told me to believe in myself, my preparation and not to follow anyone else. That changed a lot in me and it’s something I tell anyone who comes to me seeking advice today,” said Virat.
 
 
 
 Speaking about the constant criticism he faced for his aggression on field, Virat added, “Many people didn’t like me the way I was. My mistakes weren’t accepted easily. But I figured that it doesn’t matter what others feel about you. All that matters is you giving your best and doing the job at hand. To bring out the best in you, push yourself to the limit that you fall to the ground.”
