MUMBAI: Marine Drive   have sought expert opinion on collecting and preserving DNA samples of a newly-born girl whose mother is a rape survivor. The suspected biological 20-yearold father is on the run.

 
 
 A 37-year-old beauty parlour owner had approached police on Saturday alleging that the youth had raped his 17-year-old daughter at Marine Drive. The girl had delivered a baby girl on May 16. The case was transferred to   police station.
 
 The girl had been telling her family that she had stomach pain.
 
 The accused has been booked for rape and under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 The DNA test can help make a watertight case, police said, as it is admissible evidence in court.
 
 The Bombay HC had released a rape accused on bail after the DNA of the child born to the survivor did not match that of his in March. The   youth was arrested for allegedly raping his 16-year-old neighbour and spent two years in jail. The rape victim had delivered a baby. Justice   had ordered that the accused be released on a personal bond of Rs15,000.
