Actress   said her favourite of all souvenirs she has taken from her films' set is a   from the 2014 fantasy adventure film  . "Of course I've stolen. But we call it 'liberating'. It sounds so much better," Ferguson, 34, told media.

  
  
 "(My favourite thing I've taken was) a skull (from 'Hercules'). But I actually did ask the set designer if I could steal it and he looked at me and he just turned his back and walked away. And I interpreted that as, 'Obviously, of course you can steal it'," she added.
 
 Reportedly, Ferguson said she doesn't enjoy working with selfish actors. Discussing her worst times on set, she said, "Probably when I end up with very selfish actors. I think this is with any job, and you think, 'God, I'm actually stuck with this person for three or four months.' You just have to make the best of it."
 
 But she admits she has had some great times working on movies, where she has felt the 'kindness' and support of her co-stars and crew.
