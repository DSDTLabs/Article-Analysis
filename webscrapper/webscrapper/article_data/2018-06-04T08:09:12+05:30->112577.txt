GUWAHATI: The   for the underprivileged has launched a recycling centre for solid waste at Pamohi. 

 "Akshar Forum is sensitive to the imbalances in the ecology. In this part of India, burning trash is established practice. Even in higher middle class educated neighbourhoods, one comes across dry trash being burnt, along with leaves and twigs. Even plastic cups and polythene bags are also put to flame. The result is devastating. In our own city of Guwahati, we cannot see blue sky due to haze. The smoke generated is harmful to the human body too. Its effect is like smoking 40 cigarettes a day, without taking a puff," said Education Research and Development Foundation chairman M Hoque.
 
 Founder of   Foundation, Alaka Sarma, said the community which with Akshar works has a habit of burning trash, which needs to be stopped.
