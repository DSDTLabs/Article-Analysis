NEW DELHI:   Tuesday demanded the dismissal of Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta for calling the   rape-murder a “minor incident”, accusing the   of promoting legislators who had sided with the accused in the case. 

 
 “It is an absolutely blasphemous statement that has come from the deputy CM on the Kathua rape. Such casualness is the very reason why young children and women are not safe in this country and if it comes from a person who is holding an important position in the government and administration, it is even more blasphemous,” Congress spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Sushmita Dev said. 
 
 She expressed hope that Prime Minister   would take serious note of the J&K leader’s remark. “Gupta should step down or he should be sacked from his position for such an insensitive statement on a case which has rocked the nation,” Dev said. 
 
 Sharpening the attack, the Congress leader said BJP had promoted as ministers the MLAs who had sided with the accused in the Kathua case. Dev also asked BJP to spell out the message it was trying to send by promoting such legislators.
