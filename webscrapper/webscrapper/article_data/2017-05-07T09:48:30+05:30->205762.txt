MYSURU: Exhorting party leaders and workers to work towards thumping victories in both the 2018 assembly elections and the   polls in '19,   BJP president BS   said that the party would keep up pressure on the Congress government to ensure public grievances were addressed.

 After inaugurating the two-day executive meet of the state BJP unit, Yeddyurappa said that the party leaders would tour the state from May 18 in an effort to strengthen the party ahead of the 2018 elections. “Both state and central leaders have decided to tour all zilla panchayat centres for 45 days,“ he said. The party members would also assess the drought situation across the state during the tour, Yeddyurappa said. “We'll continue to demand loan waivers for farmers from the government. BJP will win more than 150 seats in the assembly polls, and 25 seats in the Lok Sabha elections,“ he added.
 
 Using the occasion to attack the Siddaramaiah government, Yeddyurappa said, “BJP leaders will explain the failures of the Congress government when they tour the state.“
 
 Highlighting the problems that people were facing to get drinking water, he added, “Congress government has taken loans of Rs 90,000 crore leaving the state in debt. It promised to spend Rs 10,000 crore on the Krishna project but has spent just Rs 3,800 crore so far. “At a press conference held later in the day, the party's Karnataka general secretary   said that separate teams would be formed under the leadership of Yeddyurappa, Jagadish Shettar, DV Sadananda Gowda and KS Eshwarappa for touring the state.
