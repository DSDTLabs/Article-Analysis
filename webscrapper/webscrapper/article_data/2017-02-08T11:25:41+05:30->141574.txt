Chief minister  , who has been at the receiving end of   against his   for women in  , refused to step down from his post. Addressing a press conference at his office on Tuesday, Zeliang said the question of stepping down did not arise. 

 "Till date, I have received the support of all elected members of the state assembly," he said, adding that only legislators could seek a change in leadership. Reacting to Congress's demand for President's Rule in the state, Zeliang said it would neither help the people nor the state. 
 
 "It would be a futile exercise," he added. Zeliang said he would meet representatives of the tribal hohos on Wednesday and clarify the government's stand on civic polls. Sources, however, said the hohos might not attend the meeting. Zeliang also dismissed reports of the ruling Naga People's Front's merger with BJP. He said NPF and BJP had been coalition partners since 2003 and enjoyed a good working relationship.
