Tirupur: Six months after his daughter married a man without his consent, a 46-year-old man was hacked to death in full public view by her father-in-law at the Nathakaadaiyur autorickshaw stand near Kangeyam here on Sunday.

 The deceased was identified as Thangavel of Nathakaadaiyur, a goods autorickshaw driver. According to police, Thangavel’s daughter Sathya Priya, 19, was in love with the son of his relative Murugesan, 55, who was also a goods autorickshaw driver.
 
 “When Sathya Priya and Murugesan’s second son Gautham revealed their relationship to their parents, both the families did not agree to their marriage. So, they got married without their parents’ consent six months ago. It did not go down well with the both the parents and it led to quarrel between Thangavel and Murugesan,” an investigation official said.
 
 On Sunday afternoon, a quarrel broke out between the two at the Nathakaadaiyur autorickshaw stand and in a fit of rage Murugesan stabbed Thangavel in his chest and abdomen using a knife, killing him on the spot. After committing the crime, Murugesan sped away in an autorickshaw owned by his elder son.
 
 When alerted, the Kangeyam police rushed to the spot and sent the body to the Kangeyam government hospital for postmortem. After the autopsy, the body would be handed over to the kin of the deceased on Monday.
 
 Meanwhile, Thangavel’s wife Poonkodi lodged a complaint with the Kangeyam police, who registered a case against Murugesan under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and launched a manhunt for him.
