LUCKNOW: The   is not amused with   governmentâ€™s plan to start 5,000 English medium schools at primary level from the coming academic session. Focusing on English alone will not do any good to primary students, feel RSS functionaries, who instead want the focus to be on mother tongues like Marathi, Telugu, Hindi, etc.

 RSS insiders said that the government should focus on imparting education in mother tongues and English should be taught just like any other language.
 
 The issue is likely to be discussed during the RSS-Yogi government coordination meeting scheduled to be held on Tuesday.
