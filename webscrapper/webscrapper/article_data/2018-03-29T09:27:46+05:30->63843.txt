CHENNAI: From April 1, vehicle users need not search for different application forms to apply for driving licences or change vehicle registration particulars. The state transport department has introduced a common application form for all these procedures, said a senior state transport department official. 

 The decision was made in line with amendments made to the Motor Vehicle Act, 1989, by the Union road transport ministry, the official added. Earlier, applicants had to fill different forms and often ended up submitting the wrong forms. 
 
 The new form (Form 2) has six options: Apply for  , learnerâ€™s licence, renew a licence, add a new class of vehicle, change of vehicle registration address and name. The form can be downloaded from the government website or acquired at sales counters at the regional transport offices for free.
