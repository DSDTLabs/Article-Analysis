New Delhi: It was   that took the lives of the three-year-old twins, Laksh and Neeshu, at   housing complex, Rohini. They were waiting for their mother, Rakhi, to give them a bath, but at the time she realised that there was no detergent. She went out to buy it to wash the last pile of clothes and left her kids alone near the semi-automatic machine, which had around 15 litres of water in the 21-inch-deep tumbler. 

 The family said that the children were curious about the washing machine, but were prevented by their parents from going near it.
 
 "There was a pile of clothes beside the machine. The twins probably climbed on them and fell down head-first inside the washing machine and got trapped," said Mohan Singh, the grandfather of the twins.
 
 "When my son went inside the bathroom to check on the children, he found their legs popping out of the washing machine," added Mohan.
 
 When police checked the   outside the house, they found that Rakhi returned home within six minutes and no one had entered or exited the house at that time. 
 
 When Rakhi could not find her children, she made a frantic call to her husband Ravinder. I rushed home after getting the call. Rakhi said everything happened within the six minutes she was out of the house,"   said.
