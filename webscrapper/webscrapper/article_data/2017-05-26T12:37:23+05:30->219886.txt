SRIKAKULAM: The   programme that aims at providing assured source of   to fallow and   has hit a roadblock. Unavailability of geologists has affected effective implementation of the programme. This, in effect, has led to a less number of borewells being sunk in the three north   thereby defeating the purpose of the programme. 

 The   Agency (DWMA), which oversees the programme implementation, received 4,400 applications from farmers owning agriculture land but dug up only 71 borewells. The government had set a target of digging 6,000 borewells in Srikakulam district this fiscal. DWMA received 200 applications between April 1 and May 20. 
 
 Project director, DWMA, H Kurma Rao attributes the dismal performance of Jala Siri to lack of geologists. “We need at least 10 geologists. We have only three officials,” Rao pointed out. Eight more will be taken on board. “We will complete the target once the geologists take charge,” Kurma Rao said.
 
 Borewells up to a depth of 200 ft (in command area) and 300 ft (in non-command area) are dug up. Each borewell costs Rs 1.10 lakh. An SC/ST farmer will have to pay Rs 6,000 to avail himself of the scheme, while a counterpart from the   will have to shell out Rs 25,000. The balance amount will be borne by the state government.
