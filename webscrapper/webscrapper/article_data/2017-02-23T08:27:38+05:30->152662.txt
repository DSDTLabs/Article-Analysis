THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police officers should come out of evil influence, chief minister   said here while declaring the expansion of   policing to all police stations in the state.

 Vijayan said that there was a time when the police stood with the rich and affluent in the society instead of the general public. They believed that they had the authority to enforce their power over the people.
 
 Though there was an attitudinal change after 1957, the relics of that attitude still existed in some officers.
 
 Vijayan said   stands for a culture that advocates support to the people, who fall victims to various evils in the society. This culture must not be restricted to police stations and it must be adopted to all levels of the department.
 
 The police must understand that there ‘maithri’ must be towards the people instead of criminals. Janamaithri cannot be achieved just by sending beat officers to citizens’ doorsteps. Senior officers too must also imbibe this culture.
 
 Vijayan said various mafia such as quotation gangs, drug mafia and sand mafia consider themselves to be powerful and in control. The police’s soft approach towards them have emboldened him, and it should change, the chief minister said.
 
 The ceremony was also attended by minister for local administration K T Jaleel, Mayor V K Prasanth and former state police chiefs and senior police officers.
