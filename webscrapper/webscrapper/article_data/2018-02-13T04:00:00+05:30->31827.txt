Rakot: The Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS) expressed displeasure on Monday over the recent Union Budget at a meeting held in Rajkot. 

 General secretary of WRMS J G Mahurkar said, “The Budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley did not speak a single word on the working conditions of railwaymen who are shouldering the burden of 1.2 lakh vacancies in safety categories connected to operations of Indian Railways and toiling hard.” He also demanded to raise grade pay of loco pilots and guards of mail and express trains. tnn
