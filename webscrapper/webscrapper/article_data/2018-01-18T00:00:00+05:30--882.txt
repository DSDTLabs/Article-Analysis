People say that wastrels spend their time at tea shops, talking about things that doesn’t affect them. But in this film, the hero gains a lot here; he makes friends for life here, and also realises the importance of living right.”
 
 The film stars   of Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum fame in the lead. “He fit the role well, and has given a good performance. Tharushi, who has done a couple of   films, is making her Kollywood debut with this. We shot the film in   and  , and completed it within 50 days,” he informs.
