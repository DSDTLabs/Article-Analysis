JAIPUR: The BJP MLA from Alwar, Gyan Dev Ahuja, claimed that lord Hanuman was the world's first tribal. Ahuja believes that   was ardently revered by tribals of the country as he formed an army comprising adivasis who were trained by Lord Ram. The MLA added that he was disturbed at seeing a photograph of Hanuman ji being disrespected during April 2 Bharat Bandh protest. 

 Interacting with media persons at the party office on Friday, Ahuja said that he had spoken to BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena and told him "You should be ashamed, you call yourself tribal and yet disrespect Hanumanji." He added that Hindu deity was the first god among tribals. "I don't know why he was disrespected, it is unfortunate," he said. 
 
 No stranger to controversies, Ahuja in February 2016 had claimed that 3,000 condoms and 2,000 liquor bottled are found every day on JNU campus. In December 2017 he had said that people who are found to be involved in cow slaughter and smuggling may be killed in a similar fashion.
