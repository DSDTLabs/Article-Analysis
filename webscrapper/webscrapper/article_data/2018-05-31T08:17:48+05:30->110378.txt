CHENNAI:   may have become a power-surplus state but the electricity board is severely understaffed and struggling to reach out to residents when there is a power failure. 

 Of its 1.3 lakh vacancies,   has filled only 86,000 positions. With the state assembly set to debate on grants for the energy department on Thursday, TNEB employee unions are hopeful that their long-pending demand for filling vacancies will be addressed by electricity minister P Thangamani. 
 
 Residents are made to wait for days before their complaints related to various services such as fuse-off, meter box change, disconnection, reconnection, transformer maintenance, biller box maintenance and power extension are attended to. TNEB has a shortage of 28,500 field workers under various categories such as Field Assistant, Wireman and Commercial Assistant.
 
 In February, about 900 field workers were recruited based on an order released in 2014. TNEB Thozhilalar Poriyalar Aykkia Sangam (workers and engineers union) general secretary M   said, "Every year, at least 1000 employees retire. To meet the demands of the consumer, TNEB will have to recruit at least 6000 field workers every year." 
 
 Meanwhile, TNEB field workers are being overworked and underpaid due to staff shortage. "The workers are supposed to work for only eight hours a day. But most of them report to work at 8am and leave only by 10pm," Subramanian said.
 
 Aside from the 900 field workers, 375 assistant engineers were also recruited based on the 2014 order. A senior TNEB official said, "We will be recruiting more workers later this year. The electricity minister is likely to address the issue of staff shortage in the assembly on Thursday,"
 
 The shortage in field staff went up recently as 6000 field workers were promoted to higher positions. "Field workers are being made to bear the brunt of public anger as they are the ones who work in direct relation with the consumers on a daily basis," Subramanian said.
