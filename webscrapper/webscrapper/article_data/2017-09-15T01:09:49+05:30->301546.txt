NEW DELHI: Days after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea for   into the murder of seven-year-old Pradhyumn Thakur in a private school in Gurugram, another aggrieved father whose son died last month in mysterious circumstances in GD   at Indirapuram in Ghaziabad approached the court seeking action against the school management. 

 Arman Sehgal, a 9-year-old Class IV student, had died after allegedly falling on the floor outside his classroom on the second-floor of the building on August 1. Alleging that fair probe was not being done and the school management was trying to cover up the case, the boyâ€™s father Gulshan Sehgal filed a petition in the apex court seeking CBI probe.
 
 The petition was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra for an urgent hearing and the court agreed to list the case on September 18. 
 
 The father challenged the order of the Allahabad High Court granting interim protection to the chairman, director and principal of the school. The HC had passed the interim order on their plea seeking quashing of the FIR against them.
 
 Sehgal pleaded in his petition that the order of the high court be stayed and appropriate action taken against the school management for negligence resulting in the death of his son.
