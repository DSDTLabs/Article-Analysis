MUMBAI: Three constables have been suspended after two activists shot a 50-minute video over five evenings at Sakinaka capturing cops purportedly extorting money from hawkers and uploaded it, garnering over 3,000 views in a week.

 “We had earlier heard how the hawkers at Sakinaka have to give money to bike-borne cops at night. So we decided to shoot,“ said activist and private detective Salim  .He went on the drive at the behest of his friend  .
 
 “We were saddened to see the cops stopping in front of hawkers to collect money. At some point, the cops are also seen taking a bottle (presumably alcohol) from a shop. All this has been uploaded on You Tube and a copy of the video sent to the police authorities and the CM's office,“ said Charania.
 
 “We have taken the complaint seriously and suspended three constables and ordered an inquiry against them,“ said  , deputy commissioner of police (zone 10). “Everyone is fed up with this type of police corruption taking place openly,“ said Pandian.
 
 This incident is not a stray case; it is common knowledge that constables all over the city collect hafta from hawkers, ho tels, beer bars, illegal constructions, and illegal parking lots. But the focus on Sakinaka cops brought back memories of the five policemen from Sakinaka police station who were involved in 2015 in kidnapping, extorting and raping a model by threatening to book her in a prostitution racket.
 
 In the video, it is difficult to see actual money changing hands. “The accused cops are not going from one hawker to the next to say “hi, hello“. It is clear some hanky-panky is on,“ said Charania. The video was shot in Khairani Road, Sakinaka junction and Asalpha.
