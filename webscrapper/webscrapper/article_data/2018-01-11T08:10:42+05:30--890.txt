 "It's true that a dead rat had fallen into the pongal that had been prepared for breakfast. But, we noticed it right before serving it to the students and discarded the entire thing. Fresh food was prepared again for the students and nobody from the school consumed the one that had the dead rat in it," said K  , the principal.
