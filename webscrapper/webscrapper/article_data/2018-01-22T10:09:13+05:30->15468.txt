BENGALURU: A 30-year-old junior biotech scientist, who was dismissed by his company, is in trouble after he allegedly followed his senior, suspecting she might be behind his ouster and misbehaved with her in   4th Block on Friday evening.

  The 37-year-old woman, a manager with the research firm, lodged a complaint against her former subordinate,  , also a resident of Koramangala, the same day.
 
 Police said Padala was allegedly misbehaving with the complainant when he was working with her. The woman had then complained against Padala to her company’s human resource department; Padala was sacked a month ago after an internal inquiry found he was at fault. 
 
  Around 4pm on Friday, Padala found the scooter-borne complainant on her way home in Koramangala. He followed her on his bike and threatened her by showing his fist. The woman stopped her scooter and asked Padala what was his problem.
 
 “Padala told the woman that she couldn’t escape from his clutches and also threatened that he wouldn’t spare her,” police said, quoting from her complaint.
 
 The woman told police that she immediately called her seniors in the company and also her landlord and informed them about the incident. Padala allegedly interrupted her while she was calling her landlord and slapped her before pushing her to the ground and speeding away.
 
 The woman rushed to Koramangala police station and filed a complaint against Padala. Cops have registered a case under   354 (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) against the accused.
 
 Police said they are investigating the matter and will arrest Padala if he is found to have committed the offence. “We have to verify the reason behind his dismissal and have to find out whether there was any personal rivalry between the woman and the suspect. It will take some time to verify these things,” an investigating officer said.
