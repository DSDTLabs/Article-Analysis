NEW DELHI: As   and his older son Akhilesh battle for ownership of a humble 'cycle', Mulayam's younger son is living life large zipping around in a   Huracan, the price of which is a hefty Rs 2-5 crore.

 Prateek, Akhilesh's half-brother and Mulayam's son from his second marriage, posted a photograph and video of himself alongside his wheels, which he's christened 'Blue Bolt'. Also featured in the photograph is his dog 'Brownie.'
 
 "Me, Brownie and Blue Bolt chillin' " says the photo caption, which displays the younger Yadav's penchant for American slang.
 
 
 
 There would be nothing incongruous about a politician's son driving such a high-end car, except that we're talking about the son of a man who is the founder of the   (SP). Samajwadi is the Hindi word for socialist, and socialism is an ideology that abhors inequality of wealth and advocates income and wealth redistribution. A Rs 5 crore car is something most dyed-in-the-wool socialists would frown upon.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Considering its ideology, the SP's election symbol is the humble cycle. And father Mulayam and older son Akhilesh are butting heads over who has claim to the cycle if the SP indeed splits following the ever-deepening rift within.
 
 While Mulayam's younger son Prateek has never shown much interest in politics - his Facebook page is filled with exercise, dog and car race videos - some political observers in Uttar Pradesh have said that his wife Aparna might be keen on the family business.
 
 A significant sub-plot in the feud within the SP is apparently Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh's efforts to stall Aparna's political debut. Aparna is a declared SP candidate from Lucknow Cantt seat for the upcoming assembly elections..
