Singer   and Emily   haven't ruled out expanding their brood once more in the future, although his wife says it won't be for a while.

 "We have a lovely relationship and I'd actually say we're closer than ever. I did have a bit of a moment the other day. A lady told she was in the very early stages of pregnancy and she hadn't told anyone else and I had a little moment where I felt a bit jealous. 
 
 "When you're pregnant it's so special and everyone wants to talk you to you about it and you have that amazing feeling of growing a person inside you," MacDonagh told OK! Magazine. 
 
 She says it is absolute magic, reports femalefirst.co.uk. 
 
 "It just brought back all these feelings for me. I worry it's going to become more often now I've thought it once. So I'm not saying I'd have one right this second as I need to work, but I'm not ruling it out," she added.
