HYDERABAD: In the past two years, only 67 women rape survivors in the city received compensation from the women and child welfare department (WCWD). Among them, only one received the full amount of Rs 1 lakh owing to a lack of convictions.

 The   last year recorded 157 rape cases. In 2016, it recorded 171 cases. “This year (2018), we registered nearly four   till now," said  , assistant commissioner of police, She Team.
 
 “Survivors of rape cases receive a compensation of ?1 lakh from the department. The first part of the compensation, which is ?25,000, is provided to the victim after medical and FIR report is sent to the WCWD. The second portion of ?25,000 is given after the chargesheet is filed,” said  , the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) of Hyderabad. The final part of the compensation of ?50,000 is provided only after a conviction.
 
 “Only one person in the past two years has got the final part of the compensation. Only 10% of rape survivors who got the first phase of the amount, received the second. In most cases, police are yet to file the chargesheet. Most of the cases get ‘compromised’ or accused get acquitted, so very few victims receive the amount,” the DCPO said.
 
 The officer said since 2012 till last year, only 13 persons have been convicted for rape in Hyderabad thereby ensuring that only 13 women in past six years have received the full amount of compensation. "Reports on nearly 100 rape cases are yet to be received from   centre by the department to dispense the first phase of compensation. Once the department receives the report, it releases the fund within 10 days. Funds are available with the WCWD, but, the police takes long to send reports,” said Rahim.
