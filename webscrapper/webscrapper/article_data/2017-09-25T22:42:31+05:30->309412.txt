CUTTACK: A special court here, designated to hear chit fund cases, on Monday allowed the state government to sale the confiscated properties of chit fund company, A B   through public auction and to distribute the sale proceeds among duped investors.

 The direction came in response to a petition filed by   the then additional district magistrate (ADM) Bibhuti Bhusan Das seeking permission from the designated court for selling the attached properties of the chit fund company.
 
 The company has allegedly duped over Rs 3 crores from investors in the state in 2014. Acting on the complaints of the duped investors, owner of the company D. Keshabananda Patra was arrested by crime branch and subsequently a land owned by the company in Puri was seized.
 
 The Ponzi firm A B   had started its operations in 2013 and had collected crore of rupees from the investors of   by assuring payment of high rates of interest on deposits. But they later closed down the offices of the company without paying either the interest or the principal amount.
 
 “A 0.5 decimel land plot owned by company in Puri was seized by crime branch. Present value of the land is Rs 80 lakh. It will be public auctioned,” said government counsel, Subrat Mohanty.
