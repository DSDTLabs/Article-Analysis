New Delhi: The fare revision of the Delhi Metro, effective from Wednesday, isn’t bringing down the operating ratio — the reason given for the recent  . As per estimates by the mass transit body, the operating ratio will remain at the existing rate in the next financial year. “It is 84 currently, and would have gone up to 114 by 2017-18, but will now remain at 84 next year,” said Delhi   spokesman,  . Operating ratio is the ratio of money spent on operations for every rupee earned.

 The impact of the fare hike, say   (DMRC) officials, is that it will halt the rising operating ratio. “There are various reasons for the increasing expenditure on operations like the cost of electricity and manpower. The fare hike will help halt the expenditure till the next financial year,” added Dayal.
 
 Figures by   show that a large component of the operational bill is consumed by power, which DMRC says has gone up 123% since 2009. Staff cost or manpower bill has also gone up by 104% while the cost of repair and maintenance has jumped by 161% since the last revision. 
 
 However, the fare revision is not likely to halt the increase for a very long time. With a larger network — set to become 350km with the opening of the two new lines — the operational spend will only go up. Dayal admitted that DMRC also has a “huge” loan liability. “As on March 31, 2016, DMRC has taken a loan of Rs 24,829 crore from JICA and repaid only Rs 2,982 crore,” said Dayal.
 
 So is a further fare revision likely? While Delhi Metro refused to comment, government officials admit that it is inevitable, though not in the immediate future. “We have to realise that the real benefit of the Metro is by reduced pollution, accidents and time saving, which makes for high economic rate of return,” said the official.
