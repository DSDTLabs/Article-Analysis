LUCKNOW: Poor waste disposal being the main reason for the city’s poor dismal show in   ranking,   has set to provide dedicated compacters at the   spots in the city. With this equipment, waste is compacted and sent to the transfer stations for disposal.

 LMC has picked 100 of the dirtiest spots or   dumping grounds in the city where garbage collection is between 20-50 tonne daily and cannot be transported unless it is compacted. The first spot is the city zoo which has a huge footfall daily. LMC estimates that on an average, the zoo produces over 20-25 tonne garbage everyday which is difficult to manage through routine waste disposal system. Hence, it would be installing its first transfer station at the zoo on Sunday. 
 
 LMC’s environment engineer   said, “These stations are called fixed-compacter-transfer stations which would be installed at 100 dirtiest spots of the city. This is being funded by waste management compnay Eco-Green.” Though there are four big transfer stations in the city that are fed garbage from across 110 wards, they are not fully functional and it is also not practical to transport large quantities of garbage daily to these stations. Hence, the plan to create small compacters at the dirtiest spots for smoother waste disposal.
 
 The   (management & Handling) Act 2000 mandates that garbage once collected from houses/ commercial places should not be dumped on ground again. Few of the other identified garbage dumping spots in Lucknow which would have dedicated stations are Chowk market, Puraniya Crossing, Chandernagar, Barabirwa Crossing, Rahimnagar crossing, Station Road and some locations of Gomtinagar.
