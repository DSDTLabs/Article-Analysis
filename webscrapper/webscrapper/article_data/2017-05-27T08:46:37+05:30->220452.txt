PUNE:   aspirants will this year go through four rounds of admission for entry to the first year. 

 Last year, the students faced five rounds, but that has now been reduced to just four. Meanwhile, the fourth round would be only for admission to government-run and government-affiliated unaided engineering colleges.   (DTE) decided to reduce the number of rounds to avoid chaos and confusion.
 
 DTE joint director Dayanand   said, “We have made the admission process student-friendly this year.”
 
  In the first three rounds, all students — including those from outside   — who will participate in the common admission process based on their joint entrance exam (JEE-Main) scores will be allotted colleges based on merit. The fourth round will be reserved only for students from Maharashtra seeking admission to government-run and government-affiliated unaided colleges. In the previous rounds, all types of colleges, including privately-run institutes, will be incorporated.”
 
 Meshram said that the change from five rounds to four was made to avoid chaos caused too many rounds that were unnecessary. The CAP rounds last year were plagued by technical glitches which were resolved for this year's process, he said. 
 
 Engineering aspirants can start filling their applications from June 5 to 17. The final merit list will be published by the DTE on June 22, and the first round of allotment of seats will commence on June 28. The academic programme will start on August 1. Science graduates (BSc) and diploma students, who were also asked to appear for the common entrance test (CET) last year, were exempted from writing the common entrance test this year.
