LUCKNOW: The   has sent five   back to their  . This makes it certain that the UP government would soon go for another administrative reshuffle soon. 

 The move comes following a request to the Centre by the state government seeking services of some senior officers of UP cadre.
 
 IAS officer Avanish Awasthi has already been sent back to Uttar Pradesh last month by the Centre.
 
 The five officers are Alok Kumar (1988 batch), Sanjay R Bhoosreddy (1989 batch), Prashant Trivedi (1989 batch), Shashi Prakash Goyal (1989 batch) and Anurag Srivastava (1992 batch). 
 
 The appointment committee of the Union Cabinet has approved immediate repatriation of these officers, a letter issued by the Government of India stated. 
 
 With this, six   officers have bee repatriated to UP against nine demanded by the state government. Until now only one IAS officer, Mrityunjay Narain, has been appointed principal secretary to CM against the tradition of 4 to five principal secretaries to the CM. It would be interesting to be seen whether any of the above five officers gets appointed as principal secretary to CM.
