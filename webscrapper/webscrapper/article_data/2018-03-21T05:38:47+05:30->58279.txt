MUMBAI: The ongoing protest at the premier   ( ) has hurt the institution's reputation in more ways than one. 

 At least three organizations, which are regular recruiters on the campus, have kept their process on hold. The three organizations together were to recruit at least 10 students from the campus. Though the institution has not received any written communication from these organizations, speculation is rife that the strike has prompted them to hold back the process for the time being. 
 
 Professor PK Shajahan, dean of students affairs and placements, said that the three organizations had given the confirmation to visit campus for the recruitment process, but have now kept it on hold. "We never have had cancellations from prospective employers after the confirmation was given. There is no written communication from the organizations citing a reason for the same," said the dean.
 
  is conducted over a week in December and then continues till the end of the academic session. 
 
 The three organizations mostly were to offer consultancy profiles for students and they are also among the institute's regular recruiters. Their requirements changes every year and this year, they had two, three and five vacancies respectively. The institute authorities fear that the ongoing   could have affected their decision to recruit. 
 
 "The institute has always promoted education for the marginalised section and has always followed an inclusive policy. Despite the fund crisis that it is facing for the last few years, the institute did not ask students to provide money upfront. However, the current model is not sustainable," said Shajahan.
 
 Students of the institute started their protest on February 21 against the withdrawal of the Government of India-Postmatric Scholarship for students from the economically-weaker section. While the OBC scholarship was not disbursed by the state for technical reasons, the institute has been working towards setting the process right.
