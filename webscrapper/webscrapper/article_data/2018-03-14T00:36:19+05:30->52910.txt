Madurai: Farmers from single crop areas in the district convened a meeting at Melur on Tuesday to discuss their next course of action to stop the Madurai Corporation from implementing the major drinking water project utilising water from Mullaperiyar dam. 

 Expressing apprehension at losing a major chunk of water meant for irrigation to drinking water purposes, they said that it will severely affect agriculture in the district.
 
 Once the water is diverted for drinking water, the irrigation share will shrink, which in turn will affect ground water table on the outskirts of the district, they said. 
 
 In the last three years, there was not enough water for irrigation from Mullaperiyar and it has affected the water level in wells and bore wells in the region, further thwarting the prospects of cultivation.
 
 Instead of creating a reservoir-like resource similar to Andhra Pradesh where Godavari and Krishna rivers have been interlinked, the authorities here after setting aside Rs 1,150 crore for the project are charting plans to destroy their sole source of irrigation, the Mullaperiyar dam, farmers rued. 
 
 Besides, they also expressed doubts about the state government being aware of this scheme and its repercussions. 
 
 During the meeting, the farmers resolved to meet chief minister and other ministers with their demand of scrapping the project and if their efforts yield no results, legal remedies will be sought. They will also rope in farmers from neighbouring Theni and Sivaganga districts to prevent this project by all means possible.
 
 Farmers from Melur and surrounding regions which are single crop areas of the district attended the meeting.
