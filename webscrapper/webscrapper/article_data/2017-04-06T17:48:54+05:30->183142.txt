The King of romance, 
  was back to doing what he does best on the sets of director Imtiaz Ali’s untitled next. Dressed in their colourful best, SRK and 
  were spotted shooting for a dance sequence on the   sets.
 
 During the week-long schedule, it had been reported that the stars would shoot a dance sequence for the film. For the first time ever, fans of the superstar got to see him sport a turban and a Punjabi avatar. Anushka, on the other hand, looked lovely as always in a traditional salwar kameez complete with delicate mirror work and a braid with bejewelled accessories.
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 The film that was tentatively titled ‘The Ring’ and later ‘Rehnuma’, has been shot across exotic locations of Prague, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Budapest. It will also see SRK and Anushka team up for the third time on-screen, after hits like ‘
 ’ and ‘
 ’.
 
 
 
  
 
 Slated for an August 11 release, the film will see Shah Rukh playing a tour guide, while Anushka will be seen playing the role of a Gujarati girl on a world tour. The adventure-romance will be clashing with 
  and Bhumi Pednekar’s ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’, which was originally expected to hit theatres in June, but was pushed back because of shooting delays.
