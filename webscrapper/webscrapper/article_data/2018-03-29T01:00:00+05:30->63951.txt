Luv Ranjan’s ' ' has been garnering appreciation from all quarters for its story line and the cast.

   , who played  , Titu’s ( ) controlling yet gullible ex- girlfriend, is happy that her small, but significant role has left a mark. The bromantic comedy, she says, has given her an opportunity to showcase multiple shades, ranging from drama and comedy to emotions.
 
  “I feel that it’s more challenging to make your presence felt when you have a smaller role, as compared with your counterparts. What matters to me is that I managed to create an impact and win appreciation even a smaller role. Frankly, I didn’t get a response like this even with the 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama' franchise. It's overwhelming to see the way the movie has been received by the audience,” she says. 
 
  The actress feels that 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety' have made people see her in a different light. She confesses that she had even sneaked inside movie halls, multiple times, to watch the film with the audience. “I have seen the movie four times in the theatres and I saw the audience laugh, clap and whistle to my scenes, especially the one where I touch Alokji’s feet, dressed in a bikini, in Kaun Nachdi song and the pre-climax scene when I say ‘Main kamini nahi hoon’. Their reaction left me spellbound and I couldn’t even react.”
 
  On his part, director   says, “Ishita has great talent to be able to emote with a variety of expressions, adaayein and nakhras, which is rare to find these days. It is this speciality that she has brought to Pihu’s character and made it livelier and memorable. On the set, we would call her the expressions queen.”
