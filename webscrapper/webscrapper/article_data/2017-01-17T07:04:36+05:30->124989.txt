PUNE: A new move to streamline the process of refuelling police   could save as much as Rs1.5 lakh every month. 

 At present, the police have just one fuel station, at the headquarters in  . And so, a police vehicle from Hinjewadi, needing a refill, is looking at a two-hour drive to Shivajinagar. For a vehicle from the Nigdi police station, it becomes a three-hour drive. 
 
 Each police station has 3-4 vehicles that need diesel on a daily basis. Which means the process of refilling the tanks consumes a lot of man hours as well as fuel, worth Rs 1.5 lakh. 
 
 Now, on the behest of police commissioner Rashmi Shukla, a   will be deployed, travelling to police stations in fringe areas. “The tanker [filled at the headquarters] will reach all stations to provide fuel to the vehicles on demand,” Sheshrao Suryawanshi, deputy commissioner of police (Headquarters), said. 
 
  Suryawanshi said, “If the journey of vehicles to the headquarters for refuelling is eliminated, we would be able to save Rs 1.5 lakh per month.”
