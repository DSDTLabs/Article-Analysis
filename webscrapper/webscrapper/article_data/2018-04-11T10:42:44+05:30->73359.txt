PUNE: Over the weekend, the National Film Archive of India ( ) is offering film enthusiasts in the city an opportunity to watch films created by one of the most famous contemporary Indian filmmakers, Amit  . These films have only been screened in foreign film festivals till date and have never been screened commercially.

 The NFAI said that film students will immensely benefit from watching his films as they are made after a thorough research of art and traditions. Dutta, who is known to be a recluse living in Himachal Pradesh has been interviewed by very few but will be present during the film screenings. 
 
 “Dutta will interact with the audience about his films and his style of filmmaking in general. We green-lighted the retrospective only after confirming his attendance, because we felt that given the kind of niche films he makes, it would be better if Dutta could speak about his films to the audience, who are expected to be young and aspiring filmmakers,” said the director of NFAI, Prakash Magdum subsequently adding that the list of films to be screened will be confirmed soon.
 
 Dutta claimed fame through the exponent of use Indian aesthetics, traditions, and art, ever since he started making student films at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).
 
 One of his most famous works, the 22-minute long Kramasha, won two National Film Awards in 2007, along with rave reviews in short film festivals, from Oberhausen to Mumbai.
 
 Rather than   theatres, most of Dutta’s work has been screened in iconic art galleries and film fesstivals, like the New York Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Modern Gallery, London.
