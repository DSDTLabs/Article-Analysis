CHANDIGARH: To save the Sukhna from drying, the UT Administration has floated a Rs-24-lakh tender for mechanical de-silting of the lake from its regulator end.

 May 23 is the deadline for bidding. The engineering department looks to hire chain-mounted  , heavy tippers, baco (backhoe) loaders, and tractors, besides tankers for sprinkling water on the temporary carriage. The project must finish within a month. The department has de-silted the lake 16 times since 1993, last in 2012 when a large portion of the Sukhna had dried. In 2012, it cleared 100-lakh cubic feet silt, while 108.16 lakh cu-ft in 2010 is the highest volume removed.
 
 Drying up is manmade Sukhna's annual summer ritual. Deficient monsoons and heavy silting (a defect since birth) keep declining the water level of the lake that Chandigarh's master architect Le Corbusier and then chief engineer   created in 1958 for Rs 1 crore.
 
  The current level is below 1,153 feet. When created, the lake stored 10.47 million cubic metre (mcm) water and covered between 1.52 and 2.28 square kilometres.
 
 Between 1958 and 1962, it lost more than 20% of its water-storing capacity due to heavy silting, which has also led to the problem of weeds. The manual removing of weeds is on over a large section of the lake. Weed experts have counted eight types in different seasons.
 
 Panjab University expert   proposed a research laboratory to solve the problem. In 2009, the Punjab and   took suo-motu notice of the shrinking Sukhna, and is monitoring the case since. On its directions, the administration pumped 20 million gallons a day of potable water into the lake from January 30 to February 30 but failed to fill the Sukhna.
