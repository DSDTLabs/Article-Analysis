KALYAN: In a bizarre revenge case, the Kalyan crime branch arrested three persons, including a 58-year-old farmer, for killing a leopard that had wiped out his livestock of 30 goats and a cow.

 The farmer used a countrymade pistol to shoot the leopard. He later asked two friends to sell the animal’s hide in the market for Rs10-Rs15 lakh. But, all three got caught.
 
 While Vishal   (30) and   (33) were arrested last week, Tukaram Veer (58) was nabbed on Monday. All are residents of   taluka in   district. Sanju John, senior police inspector of Kalyan crime unit, received a specific input that some people were coming to the city to sell leopard hide. They laid a trap and arrested Dhanraj and Mahatre from Kalyan-Shilphata Road and seized the hide.
 
 Police said on being questioned, the duo spilled the beans on Veer.
 
 When grilled, cops were shocked to learn Veer was the son of infamous poacher  . Though he had been into farming, he told police he had suffered heavy losses due to repeated attacks by the leopard in the past few months.
 
 “The accused has claimed he decided to kill the leopard to recover his losses. We have recovered the animal’s nails from his possession,” said John.
