Vadodara: P Bharathi on Monday took charge as collector of Vadodara district. Bharathi, who was earlier serving as collector of Panchmahal district, is the second female collector of Vadodara district after Avantika Singh, who is presently serving as the Ahmedabad district collector. 

 Bharathi has replaced Lochan Sehra, who was serving as Vadodara collector since May 2016. 
 
 During the recent bureaucratic reshuffle which saw the state government transfer 45 IAS officers, Sehra was appointed managing director of Gujarat Urban Development Company Limited, Gandhinagar. 
 
 After taking charge she said her efforts will be to ensure that Vadodara continues to scale new heights on the front of development. She said she will work hard to ensure that benefits of the welfare schemes of the state government reach the beneficiaries at grassroot level.
