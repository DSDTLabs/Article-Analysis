NEW DELHI: The working of public charitable trusts will be examined to ensure that they are in conformity with the law and are not misusing tax exemptions, the Comptroller and Auditor general (CAG) said in a reply to   MP  . Responding to the MP's letter in which he referred to trusts being found to be in breach of rules, deputy comptroller and auditor general   said the concerns raised would be addressed. 

 "Audits of the working of public charitable trusts will be considered to address the concerns expressed by you, and we are examining the matter currently for this purpose," the letter to Dubey said. In his letter to CAG, the   MP had said that it had come to light that several trusts were engaged in business activities even while claiming benefits as charitable organisations.
