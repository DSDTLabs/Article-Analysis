HYDERABAD: Then and now. Two friends who fell out. This was the topic that trended in fits and bouts on some social media platforms and messaging apps with people exchanging comments, videos and photographs of TRS president and chief minister   and   chairman  . At the receiving end was the CM with a bulk of such posts coming from TJAC and Prof Kodandaram`s followers or sympathisers.

 Of particular popularity was a video from pre-Telangana state days where   is seen calling Kodandaram `a representative of four crore people from Telangana' and saying he would rip the tongue of any person who criticised the professor. KCR is also seen helping Kodandaram to his feet, and calling the TJAC chairman a man of gold.
 
 But the really damaging posts were of the events that began unfolding around 3am at Kodandaram's house in Tarna ka. While Kodandaram's arrest was broadcast live on   including the argument between the   deputy commissioner of police and Kodandaram, in the background, sounds of a door being forced open can be heard even as the TJAC chairman asks the police officer about the hurry for a preventive arrest at 3am and that he was willing to be taken away at 6 am.
 
 The video ends with images of Kodandaram being taken away in a police van asking if a preventive arrest meant breaking down of doors, a question met with deafening silence. His question on which police station he is being taken to is also met with silence. Then one of the policemen in the van can be heard making a plea asking Kodandaram to turn off the live broadcast on Facebook. When Kodandaram asks why , he says “we are your people, I am your man 100%. Please turn off the live broadcast.“ TJAC changed its Facebook page cover image declaring February 22 as `Black Day in Telangana'.
