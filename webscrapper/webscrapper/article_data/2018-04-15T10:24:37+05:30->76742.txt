MYSURU: The   on Saturday threatened to discontinue their services to the state government's   scheme and the  's   project if the new holiday policy is not revoked. 

    secretary of the Federation, Y Mahdevamma said that the new holiday system will put a lot of pressure on anganwadi workers and helpers. She alleged that anganwadi workers and helpers have been denied incentives to implement the Mathru Poorna and Matru Vandana schemes. "If the state government and Centre fail to provide us the incentive along with cooking utensils, we will stop working for the implementation of these schemes," said Mahadevamma. 
 
 "Under the Mathrupoorna scheme an Anganwadi worker is entitled to an incentive of Rs.500 while the helper is entitled to Rs 250. This incentive has not been paid to us by the state government while the Mathruvandana scheme of the center entitles us to an incentive of Rs.2000 a month which has not been paid to us," she added. 
 
 As per the new summer holiday policy, the Centre has provided 15-day leave to anganwadis and helpers. The catch is that the helper has to work when the anganwadi worker is on leave and vice versa.
