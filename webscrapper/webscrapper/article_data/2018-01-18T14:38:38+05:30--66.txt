PATNA: The East Central   (ECR) has decided to use high-tech drone cameras to keep a close surveillance on the progress of ongoing railway projects worth several crores in the zone during 2017-2018 fiscal.

 ECR chief public relations officer ( ) Rajesh Kumar said drones are being used by the railways for the first time for 11 major projects being carried out in   and   areas falling under the ECR jurisdiction to expedite works so that the projects could be completed within the stipulated time, he said.
 
 The major railway projects include Koderma-Giridih new line (25km),   track doubling (10.5km),   — Sheopur new line (44km), Koderma-Ranchi new line (63km), Saharsa-Forbesganj gauge conversion (59km), Sakri-Forbesganj gauge conversion (91km), Nirmali-Saraigarh Kosi Bridge, Khagaria-Kusheshwarsthan new line (42km), Hasanpur-Kusheshwarsthan new line (24km), Kurshela-Rajpul track doubling (2km) and Goshar-Vaishali new line (30km), the CPRO said .
 
 He also said each project manager has been asked to conduct an aerial survey through drones at least once in two to three months to expedite the work. “It is likely to incur an expenditure of about Rs4,000 for each aerial surveillance over an area of one kilometre. Chief administrative officer (CAO) of the railway construction wings would view the progress at regular intervals and ensure quality maintenance as well,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, railway experts have welcomed surveillance through drones in Bihar. This facility would help railways keep a watch on the progress of its projects even in the densely remote area, they said, adding railways must also use drone surveillance for other construction projects.
