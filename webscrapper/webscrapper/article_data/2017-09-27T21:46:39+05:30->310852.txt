NEW DELHI: Over 180 people on a Delhi-bound flight were among those who had a narrow escape at   on Wednesday morning when the airport came under the rocket attack. A   737 was being prepared for a flight to Delhi when the attack happened and all those on board the aircraft had to be rushed to a safer place.

 “The boarding for   flight SG 22 (Kabul-Delhi) was almost complete when the incident took place. Passengers and crew were safely deboarded and taken to the terminal building. There was no damage to the aircraft,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.
 
 The aircraft, that was supposed to fly to Delhi with almost a full load of 174 passengers, will most likely take off on Thursday as the   airport has been closed after the attack. 
 
 The latest attack at Kabul Airport happened soon after US defence secretary   landed there. “A rocket landed near the airport this morning. No casualties reported,” Afghanistan’s interior ministry spokesperson   said in a tweet.
 
 The Taliban have claimed on Twitter that US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, who was visiting Kabul, was the target of the attack.
 
 The Kabul airport has faced rocket attacks several times in the past too. In July 2014, a similar attack took place when a SpiceJet aircraft was getting ready to fly to Delhi. Luckily for the over 100 passengers on board the Delhi-bound   737 in July 2014, the rocket had landed at a safe distance from the aircraft and had hit a hangar.
