AHMEDABAD: A team of   (ACB) probing multi-crore   at  , Waghodia, have revealed that there were 105 persons who had issued 220 cheques to the medical college - implying assurance of multiple payments by a single parent. Out of the 105, 26 are found to be from outside Gujarat.

 After getting the four-day remand for the three accused arrested in the case, ACB has started working on financial aspect of the case - connecting the dots by checking personal and college’s bank accounts against the financial instruments recovered from office and residences of the university founder Mansukh Shah and his aides Ashok Tailor and Vinod Sawant.
 
 “We have roped in a CA for the probe. As the time period of issuance is not clear in some of the cheques, questioning the issuers about the reason might throw light on that aspect. We have also sought banks’ help to get details,” said a senior ACB official.
 
 Meanwhile, five teams headed by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) level officers worked overnight to investigate the cheques seized. ACB officials at district levels have been entrusted with recording the statements to speed up the process. Sources said that most of the issuers are from urban centres.
 
 “We have been getting a steady stream of complaints on our helpline (1064) and respective ACB offices talking about the anomalies and sometimes exploitation of parents by the college authorities. Our prime focus is to investigate the case at hand but the callers are providing valuable inputs,” said the official.
 
 The officials said that they also face queries about how the case could be registered against the private institution. “We tell them that there is provision in Prevention of Corruption Act specifically talking about it,” said the official.
 
 On Thursday, the investigators also sought help from forensic experts to go through digital records seized in the searches at Vadodara hoping to get more evidences.
