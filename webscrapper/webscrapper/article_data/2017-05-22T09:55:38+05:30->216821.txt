PUNE:   in city limits might prove costly to   on the fringes of the city. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued notices to these local governing bodies, and will soon initiate action to file criminal offences. 

 Burdened with tonnes of garbage, the civic body has appointed squads to stop fringe villages from dumping trash in PMC limits. Notices were served to Dhayari, Narhe, Ambegaon and Nanded.
 
 According to PMC officials, these villages dump 15 tonnes of garbage in the open every day. “The responsibility for disposing garbage lies with local bodies of the villages. But it appears they are not doing it. This (open dumping of garbage) poses a health risk to citizens,” said  , ward officer for the Sinhagad Road area.
 
 He said the PMC has planned to file criminal offences against the Gramsevaks of these villages, if the situation does not improve. Fines could be imposed too, he said. 
 
 “The villages are expanding. It has become tough for the governing bodies here to manage basic infrastructure such as water and garbage disposal. These villages should be incorporated into PMC limits,” said  , an elected member of the Panchayat Samittee of Dhayari.
 
 The problem of garbage dumping in the open has been in the news since April when a major fire had broken at the Uruli-Phursungi garbage depot. Since then. garbage has been piling up in the city as local villagers did not allow garbage to be dumped any further.
