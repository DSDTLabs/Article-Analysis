PUNE: Three armed robbers made off with gold ornaments and cash collectively worth Rs7.32 lakh from two houses in the   village near  , around 65km from here, on Tuesday early morning.

 Sambhaji Hinge’s house was one of the targets of the robbers. On Monday night, Sambhaji, his wife and son were sleeping on the terrace, while his sister,  , slept in the house after she locked the door from inside. 
 
 Around 1.30am, Sambhaji’s neighbour, Dashrath Hinge, called him to inform him about the robbery in his house. “The suspects made off with Rs2,200 from Dashrath’s house,” an officer of the Manchar police said.
 
 Sambhaji decided to go to Dashrath’s house. “When he was getting down from the terrace, he saw someone running out of his house. Around the same time, he heard his sister scream. He ran down and found the main door broken and Rupali lying injured on the floor,” the officer said. 
 
 Rupali informed Sambhaji about the three men who barged into their house. “She woke up when the men were breaking the cupboards. When she tried to raise an alarm, two of them caught hold of her. They beat her up and banged her head against the bed. The third person searched the cupboards and picked up the boxes containing the gold ornaments,” the officer said. 
 
 Sambhaji later found the empty boxes in his backyard. “The thieves made off with Rs7.32 lakh collectively, including Rupali and Sambhaji’s wife’s gold ornaments and Rs8,500,” the officer said. 
 
 Sub-divisional police officer Ram Pathare visited the spot after getting the information. The police have launched a search for the suspects.
