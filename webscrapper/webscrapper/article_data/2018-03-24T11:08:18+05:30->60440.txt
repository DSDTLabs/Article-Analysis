MANGALURU:   after coming in contact with a temporary and movable  , that was erected to prevent wild animals entering fields, may have been the cause of death of two youngsters, who ventured into the forest at midnight for hunting in  , reveals preliminary reports.

 It was an extreme passion for hunting that led Gratian and his friend to venture into the forest often to hunt wild boars, porcupines, hares and other animals, said sources. According to sources, they went to hunt as usual, after parking their vehicle in the foothills of Karinje, Moodbidri, late on Tuesday night, and are said to have carried knives, guns and torches. They ventured into the reserve forest in Karinje, and when they did not return even on Thursday, a missing complaint was filed in the   police station.
 
 However, the duo were not aware of an electric fence laid to prevent wild animals from coming into farmland, and came in contact with it, due to which they died on the spot, said sources. Eyewitnesses said there were signs of the duo struggling after being electrocuted in a barren  , which was submerged in a shallow amount of water.
 
 Sources said the people responsible for placing the electric fence may have removed it after finding the two dead youth, but havenâ€™t informed the police, fearing that they may be arrested.
 
 The area where they were found dead was an uncultivated field. Usually villagers, to keep wild animals at bay, place removable electric fences around fields, and rig it with a direct connection from nearby electric poles, which is illegal. Some adopt this practice to kill wild boars.
 
 Gratian Rodrigues, an entrepreneur, was married four years ago, and has a two-year-old daughter. His wife is a teacher at a school in Moodbidri. Victim   was an agriculturalist.
 
 Police officers investigating the case said that they will think of a future course of action in the case, once the Forensic Science Lab reports are out.
