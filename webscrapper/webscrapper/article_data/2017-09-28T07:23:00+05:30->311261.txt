New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the police to provide additional security to controversial arms dealer Abhishek Verma, a witness in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, as he was receiving threat calls.

 The court directed the DCP of south district here to depute two more security personnel for personal security of Verma, his wife and mother till October 10 as he has to undergo a lie detection test between October 3 and 6. Currently, the police has provided one security personnel to Verma round-the-clock in pursuance to a trial court order.
 
 While Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, who has been given clean chit thrice by the CBI, has refused to undergo the test, Verma had given conditional consent saying he is ready to undergo the test if he was provided round-the-clock security as he feared threat to his life.
 
 "Keeping in view the facts and circumstances, DCP (South) is directed to provide two more security personnel to the petitioner (Verma) and his family members till October 10," Justice I S Mehta said. Advocate Maninder Singh, who appeared for Verma, said he has to appear for lie detection test between October 3 to 6 and has been receiving threatening emails and phone calls.
