 Taking objection to Naidu saying that the Centre has to deem it fit to `bestow' special status on AP , Kalyan said, “Do you think we are your slaves?“ “If only you showed the same interest as you did in Swarna Bharathi Trust and the Ram Mandir issue, you could have got special status for AP ,“ he said at a press meet at the party office in the city.
 
 Kalyan said he had trusted both AP CM Chandrababu Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is why he had campaigned for the TDP-BJP candidates in the 2014 elections. “They made use of me in Telangana, AP , Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.But they are not delivering on the promises made for the state,“ he said.
 
 The actor-turned-politician also took umbrage at Union science and technology minister Y Sujana Chowdary's remarks on the special status issue. Chowdary had said that the protest at RK Beach in Vizag had no fizz and that if peo ple were inspired by the jallikattu protests, then they should play the sport with pigs.“That was not the way to speak,“ he said.
 
 Pawan also asked Chandrababu Naidu to constitute a committee of ex-judicial officers to look into allegations against his partymen. “Singapore's ex-premier Lee Kuan Yew is Naidu's inspiration.Yew had jailed his own friends for corruption. Naidu should also do it,“ he said.
