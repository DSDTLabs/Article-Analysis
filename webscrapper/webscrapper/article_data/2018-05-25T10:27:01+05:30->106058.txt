 JAIPUR: Jyotirvigyan   (centre of astrology) was started in the   in 2007 to develop the study of astrology with scientific and modern techniques. After spending lakhs of rupees in the infrastructure and facilities the centre is lying vacant with no faculty and students.
 
 
 When the department was started around Rs 4 lakh were spent on books for the library. There was also an investment of Rs 15 lakh on the furniture and computer lab and around Rs 12 lakh worth two telescopes were purchased for research. Today, not a single student is there to use the department’s scientific and costly equipment that are lying in the store room covered with dust.
 
 “The number of students was very low since the beginning so the authorities stopped the admissions. However, we are trying to revive the diploma and four new diploma courses - medical astrology, vastu shastra, jyotigya pragya and jyotish bhushan, because we thought if we will specify the subjects, students might take more interest. Many times proposal was forwarded in the academic council meeting but no action was taken. There are students who want to study these subjects but without the revival of the courses these costly equipment will be of no value and they will only gather dust,” said a professor.
 
 From 2008 till 2012 less than 15 students had applied for the admissions. One batch was admitted but eventually with such low response the university authorities decided to stop the course. Public relations officer of the university,  , said, “There are recruitments going on and after which the professors will be available for the centre. planning is on and further action will be taken after the new recruitments.”
