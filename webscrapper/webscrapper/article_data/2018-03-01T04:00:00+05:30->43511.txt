Surat: Amroli police booked a visa consultant who allegedly cheated some citizens, who were preparing to go to Canada. 
 
 Accused Dinesh Solanki took Rs 25 lakh in all from visa aspirants and disappeared. 
  
 Solanki, a resident of Swastik Row House on Kosad Road, promised them of getting visa for Canada. One of the victims Vipul Kadwa (25), an employee in an agriculture products unit, lodged a complaint against Solanki. Kadwa said he had paid Rs 17 lakh to Solanki in April 2016 and since then he has been waiting for his visa. Apart from Kadwa, the accused duped some other people of around Rs 7 lakh. 
  
 Kadwa was exploring employment options in Canada when he came in contact with Solanki. The accused charged money from Kadwa for various expenditures. When Kadwa did not get visa, he started demanding his money back. However, Solanki became incommunicado and was not found at his home when Kadwa went there several times. 
  
 “The accused is not living at his home from where he operated. We are working to locate him,” the police said.
