NEW DELHI: The ministry of tribal affairs (MoTA) has raised a number of concerns with the draft rules for implementation of the compensatory afforestation fund (CAF) Act, notified by the union environment ministry recently. A major concern according to MoTA officials is they way gram sabha has been defined in draft rules. 

 Senior officials at the   said the ministry was not consulted during the framing of the rules despite tribals being the most important stakeholder in plantation and conservation projects of the government in forest areas. Environment ministry officials however claimed that the tribal affairs ministry was consulted earlier.
 
 The draft rules define gram sabha “as the same meaning as assigned to it in article 243(B) of the Constitution.” which states “gram sabha means a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of panchayat at the village level.” “The role of gram sabha has been broadened strengthened after the forest rights act 2006 came in to force. But the environment ministry has completely overlooked the FRA definition of gram sabha,” a senior official of the Tribal Affairs ministry told TOI. 
 
 The ministry has also called for a consultation of civil society and tribal organisations on the draft rules on March 18. FRA 2006 defines gram sabha as “a village assembly which shall consist of all adult members of a village and in case of states having no panchayats, padas, tolas and other traditional village institutions and elected village committees, with full and unrestricted participation of women.” By not specifying, the new definition consultations with forest dwellers could be restricted to panchayat level villages, officials said. The draft rules also state that when afforestation or plantation projects are to be taken up in forest land under the control of forest department and being managed under a working plan with participation of local people, then they should be taken up in consultation with gram sabha or the   or the village forest committee as the case may be. Tribal affairs ministry officials said the gram sabha’s consent cannot be interchangeable with other non-statutory bodies.
 
 The ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) came out with draft rules for the utilisation of Rs 50,000 crore compensatory afforestation fund on February 16 but a copy of the draft was leaked months back before it was notified. 
 
 “Artificial regeneration provision or plantations is also an issue because it may impact of the gene pool in our forests. We also need to know how tribals will be consulted, whether their opinion will be taken on board in areas where plantation activities will be taken up under the CAF Act. They should have tested the waters with us before notifying the draft rules,” the official added.
  
 Tribal Affairs ministry officials who will be sending their comments to the environment ministry soon also pointed that in the draft rules, the tribal affairs ministry officials are not explicitly made members in any committee. For example in the selection committee for the appointment of non-official members to the national authority for utilisation of CAF Act, apart from environment ministry officials, it states “one secretary from any other ministry to be nominated by the MoEFCC.” “They should have been explicit about which ministry,” said MoTA officials. Following various objections to the CAF act raised by some   leaders in 2016, late environment minister,   had assured the   that rules would provide for necessary consultation with gram sabhas.
 
 A senior environment ministry official from forest policy division told TOI, “Who is to define gram sabha? It was in existence even before the FRA was enacted. Every act cannot have a separate definition of gram sabha. MoTA should go back and look at their two year old records on whether their officials were consulted. The environment ministry cannot overlook the tribal affairs ministry. Their views may not be incorporated but will be taken care of to the extent possible.”
 
 
 
 
 Every time forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes like mining or industry, the user agency is supposed to "afforest" an area of the same size of the forests that were diverted. Since these plantations do not immediately provide the ecological services that the natural forest that was cut down would provide, the law requires the user agency to compensate the loss by paying the "net present value (NPV)" of the forests for the next 50 years. The NPV, calculated by a panel of experts is anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 11 lakh depending on the type and quality of forests that were diverted.
 
 
 
 
 80% of the net present value (NPV) of forests can be utilised for:
 
 • Assisted natural regeneration
 • Artificial regeneration (by plantation)
 • Silvicultural operations in forests
 • Protection of plantations and forests
 • Pest and disease control in forest
 • Forest fire prevention
 • Soil and moisture conservation
 • Planting and rejuvenation of forest cover on non-forest land falling in wildlife corridors
 • Relocation of villages from protected areas
 
 Rest of the 20% can be utilized for “strengthening of forest and wildlife related infrastructure, capacity building of state forest department personnel” among others.
