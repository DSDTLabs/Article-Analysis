 Vandana Patel, AAP women’ wing leader, alleged that the state government is trying to derail the process of justice and protect its criminal leaders in the case. “We have decided to organise a protest outside the CM's house on Sunday (February 12)," the AAP leader said.
 
 “Much time has passed since one girl filed a complaint but no one has been arrested,” Patel said. “Police are acting on the instructions of top BJP leaders.” She said that the Prime Minister had asked women of Gujarat to treat him like a brother and send him just a postcard if they had any problem.
