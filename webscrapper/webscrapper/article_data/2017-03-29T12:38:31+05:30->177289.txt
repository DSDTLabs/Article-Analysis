NEW DELHI: The government has sacked IPS probationer  , a 2010 batch officer belonging to Maharashtra cadre, for failing to clear the mandatory physical fitness examination in the basic training course for IPS officers. 

 Salunkhe, who reportedly has weight issues, had not only failed the physical fitness exam at the   but also could not clear it despite multiple opportunities, both during the two-year extension of his probation period till December 2014 and two years thereafter. Salunkhe was issued a show-cause notice in July last year asking why he should not be discharged from IPS. He did not reply despite a reminder in January 2017.
 
 The March 22 order discharging him from IPS states: "Salunkhe does not possess the basic physical fitness qualities to be eligible for retention in the IPS...Salunkhe has wilfully neglected his probationary studies or duties and has been lacking in qualities of mind and character needed for the service".
 
 This is not the first time that an IPS officer has been discharged from service for failing to clear the fitness paper. 
 
 Kusum Punia, a 2010 batch IPS officer belonging to Jharkhand cadre, and 2011 batch IPS probationer from West Bengal cadre, Kumar Gautam, were sacked last year on the same ground. 
 
  Union home minister   allowed them to be reinstated provided they cleared the remaining papers of   course. Both Punia and Gautam did so and were confirmed as IPS officers.
