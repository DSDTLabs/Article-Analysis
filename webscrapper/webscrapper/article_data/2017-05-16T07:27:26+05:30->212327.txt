DEHRADUN: A team of senior officials of the   (IMD) which was in the state to inspect the locations that have been shortlisted for setting up Doppler radars have approved two such sites. While the   team gave its nod to the sites in Mussoorie and Nainital, the site in Pithoragarh was found unsuitable.
 
  The team will now visit Chopta in Chamoli to see whether the highly specialized weather forecasting systems can be installed there.
  
  Secretary disaster management   told TOI, “The proposed site at Mussoorie in Dehradun district and Devsthal in Nainital district were found suitable. However, the experts were not sure about the site in Pithoragarh.”
  
  A team headed by director   will visit Chopta next week.
  
  In May 2014, the then chief secretary  , in the wake of the mid-June 2013 disaster had spoken to IMD officers and it was decided that the IMD would set up three radars on land provided by the Uttarakhand government. However, no major progress has taken place in the project in this period.
  
  In the meeting with IMD officials on Monday, chief secretary Ramaswamy laid stress on timely dissemination of weather forecast. He said that setting up huge LED display boards at these locations will help spread weather related information to maximum possible people in the region.
  
  The IMD officials assured the government that technical support for the installation of meteorological observation instruments would be provided.
