Any housing society found collecting donation for   festivities without permission from the charity commissioner’s office may face heavy penalty. Permission can be sought in person at the charity commissioner’s office, or can be applied for online.

  of Pune region, Shivaji Kachare, said during Ganeshotsav, there was not enough awareness. However, for Navratra, the department wants to make sure all housing societies acquire the requisite permission.
 
 “Ten housing societies were served notices for failing to comply with the rules during Ganesh festivities. One even faces a penalty of Rs 10,000 for not intimating the office and for not taking permission under Section 41C of the Maharashtra Public Trust Act,” Kachare said, adding, “We have made an appeal through the police department this time.” 
 
 However, there is a caveat. Housing societies in Mumbai argue that as legal entities, they are permitted to seek funds from residents within the premises for organizing the festival. It is only when they solicit money from sources outside the compound that they need to seek registration under Section 41C.
 
 The permission form requires the society to specify the amounts collected and spent, and even the overall audit report of the society must be furnished. Moreover, 10 per cent of the revenue collected should be given to some educational or medical charity, or be utilised to fill up potholes on roads nearby. During Ganeshotsav, the mandals that had taken permissions were asked to repair potholes. This is because many places were dug up for pandals. “There is bound to be some resentment, but it is a social responsibility,” said the official.
