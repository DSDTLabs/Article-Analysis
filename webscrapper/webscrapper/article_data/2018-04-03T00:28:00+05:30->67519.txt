Bhopal: Two years ahead of deadline, government employees displaced for smart city development in North TT Nagar area would be accommodated in new residential complexes. Around 600 government employees would benefit from the move. According to sources, Bhopal Smart city development corporation limited (BSCDCL) is expected to finalise takeover of residential accommodation in a meeting on April 5. On the agenda, would be purchase of 600 flats located at Old Mandi. The BDA backed scheme at Maha Laxmi residential complex is nearly completed. It is located Pul Bodgha road near Jehangirabad. BDA project began five years ago and the total number of flats in the scheme are 781 (2BHK 501 and 3BHK 280) and BDA construction cost was pegged at Rs 246 crore. Smart city takeover of most of the constructed area, would enable early rehabilitation of displaced government employees. As a precursor to the move, BMC anti-encroachment sleuths have been carrying out operation to clear illegal encroachments in the area. MP government had changed the location of Bhopal smart city â€“ area based development (ADB) from Shivaji Nagar to North TT Nagar. One of the reasons was also resentment by government employees to be relocated. The current move by BSCDCL would also help the corporation get possession of 348 acre ADB land and change perception towards smart city development. Over all, smart city aims to develop 3,240 residential housing flats. Recently, foundation stone laying ceremony for Rs 200 crore, 660 government housing flats near Palash hotel was carried out. It was to be Phase I of the scheme. Within accommodation for government housing taken care by takeover of BDA housing scheme, changes in smart city plan for ABD are not ruled out, said sources.
