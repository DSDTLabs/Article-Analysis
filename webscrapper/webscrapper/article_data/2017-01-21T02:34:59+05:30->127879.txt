NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal on Friday asked the police brass to focus on technology-based policing and   more with the youth. The   said this while meeting senior officers on his maiden visit to Delhi Police headquarters.

 All departments, including Crime Branch, Special Cell, control room, intelligence and special branch, had prepared presentations to explain the functioning of their units to the LG.
 
 Baijal also took a round of the central police command room (C4i) and the police control room before having detailed discussions with the officers. He stressed on providing better security and connection with the people from the northeast. “The youth have to be partners in our policing approach,” he said.
 
 The LG said that modern day policing was challenging and a complex task in a mega-city like Delhi. “The police must technologically upgrade itself and build strong relations with all communities,” he said, adding that he would always support initiatives of a better police-public interface.
 
 Asked about the LG’s office having referred several complaints pertaining to AAP to CBI and the fact that Alok Verma was taking charge as the new director, Baijal said, “Let him sit on the charge. He will reply to you.” Verma refused to take any questions.
