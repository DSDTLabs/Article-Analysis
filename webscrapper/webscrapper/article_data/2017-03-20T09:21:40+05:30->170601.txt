CHENNAI: Flung across a divider and onto a service lane alongside a main road when the rider of the motorcycle on which she was riding pillion braked suddenly, a 20-year-old college student was run over by an oncoming   near Kasimedu on Saturday evening.

 Police on Sunday said the freak accident took place when motorcycle rider Vimal, 20, trying to come to a halt to answer a phone call, lost control of the two-wheeler.
 
 “R Supriya, who studied in the same college in Korrukupet as Vimal, was thrown off the motorbike,” a police officer said. “She fell on the service road and was run over by the rear wheels of the truck. Vimal fractured his hand.”
 
 He said investigators determined the identities of motorcycle riders only on Sunday morning.
 
 “Supriya was riding pillion with Vimal, who offered to give her a ride home from college,” the officer said. “When the pair got to   near Kasimedu around 3.50pm, Vimal received a call on his cellphone. He stepped on the brake pedal hard, bringing the vehicle to a sudden halt and losing control of the bike.”
 
 The pillion rider, taken by surprise and apparently not holding on to the bike or rider securely, was flung from her seat.
 
 “Vimal was riding the motorcycle rashly,” an investigating officer said. “Neither he nor the truck driver noticed that woman had been flung off the bike and onto the service road. A woman rider passing by saw what had happened and called for help. The truck driver stopped his vehicle and found that she had died on the spot.”
 
 The Kasimedu traffic investigation police have registered a case against Vimal under IPC Section 304 (a) (causing death due to negligence). Policemen took the pair to  , where doctors pronounced Supriya dead on arrival. They conducted a postmortem before police handed over the body to family members.
 
 The rider will be arrested after he is discharged from hospital, the investigating officer said.
