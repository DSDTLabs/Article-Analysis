BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Commission for Child Rights Protection ( ) will issue notices to private schools that force parents to buy uniforms and books for their children from vendors selected by the former. 

 “We’ve received complaints from both parents and social organisations against some schools. Forcing parents to purchase uniform and books from a particular shop is in violation of the Karnataka Educational Institutions Rules-1995 and the Right to Education Act as well. We’re going through the complaints and collecting reports on such schools. We’ll issue notices to them,” said KSCPCR chairperson Kripa Alva.
 
 Last year, the KSCPCR had issued an order against seven schools based on the petition filed by  , a social organisation. The forum has again complained against the schools for not complying with the commission’s order.
 
 “The commission issued an interim order restricting the schools against prescribing vendors supplying uniform and books. But, the schools are not following the order. We urge the education department also to take steps to de-recognise these schools,” said   H, state president of Ambedkar Yuva Sene.
 
 He said the schools had floated tenders to choose vendors to supply uniform and books and accepting commission from them. “A few schools have fixed March 20 as the last date to buy uniform and schools from the vendor they suggested and are insisting on drawing DD in the vendor’s name. They are threatening to cancel the admission of their wards in the event of failing to obey the diktat,” alleged Kodandaram.
 
 Alva said the petitioner may move the court against the schools if they found to have violated the commission’s order.
