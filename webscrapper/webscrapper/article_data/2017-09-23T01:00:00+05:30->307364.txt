GAYA: Angry commuters of Gaya-Dehri-on-Sone passenger   tied its driver to a pole and pelted him with stones for the long and unscheduled stoppage of the train near the railway station. The driver somehow managed to safety and took shelter in the nearby cabin.

 According to railway sources, the train left Gaya Junction at 12.25pm and a couple of minutes later stopped near the west home cabin. After waiting for about an hour for the train to move on, the passengers got restive and demanded an explanation from the driver for the unscheduled stoppage at a short distance from the station. When the passengers were told that the train was stopped to facilitate routine track repair, they started abusing railway officials for their irrational behaviour saying if the train had to be stopped for track repair, it should have been detained at the station itself.
 
 The passengers also forcibly stopped the Agra-Kolkata Express and paralysed train movement on the down line as well.
 
 Rail area officer Sandip Kumar said the driver, Raju Pratap Singh, had been admitted to Gaya Railway Hospital. A substitute driver was requisitioned for the train’s onward journey.
 
 Asked why the train was not detained at the station itself, Sandip said there was a ‘blockade protocol’ for track repair and he was not in a position to comment on it. Traffic on both the Up and Dn tracks of the Gaya-Mughalsarai route resumed later, he said.
