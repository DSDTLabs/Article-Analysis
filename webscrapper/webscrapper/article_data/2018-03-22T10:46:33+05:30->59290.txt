PANAJI: A day after resigning as state   president, 
  on Wednesday had a word or two to describe the selection of the next party president. Without naming anyone, Naik expressed reservations about young Congressmen. “Commitment of Congressmen should not be to the person, but to the party,” he said.

 Though the next   president had not been finalized, he said that the party would probably appoint a younger person. “I can suggest that the person should have at least 10 years of service in the party and should have love and commitment for the party. These are the essential terms,” he said.
 
 Naik has been criticised for not holding sufficient meetings with block and district level members and party insiders said the party’s senior leadership was not too pleased with Naik’s performance as party president.
 
 Naik himself has refuted these charges and has claimed that though the   were completed in October, the results of the elections were never officially announced.
 
 “How could I go to hold meetings without the official list of members?” Naik told reporters. He said that now the new president would have the opportunity to hold constituency-wise meetings with all the workers. “If you have the basic cadre, booth wise, nobody can defeat Congress,” he said.
