KOLKATA: In the next two years you will be under   during your entire journey on the   of the city. The decision was announced by senior cops during an interaction between   and   on Tuesday afternoon.

 “Our plans in the future include setting up of   cameras every 200-300 metres on the major thoroughfares. The idea is to ensure that every crime or accident on the roads is captured on CCTV,” said Joyeeta Bose, DC (wireless).
 
 Lalbazar sources later hinted that this was only a part of the modernization programme that was introduced recently. Besides the 50 new drones and 500 new CCTV cameras for which the tenders have already been placed, the police are also buying a number of speed guns and cameras that can read number plates even at night.
 
 The city police has 1200 CCTVs (in arrangement with private partners). The cops said they were planning to double this number. “Last year, whether it was the Red Road accident or the kidnap-and-murder of a 12-year-old at Dalhousie, CCTV footage played a key role,” said a detective department officer.
 
 The traffic police want to take it a step further by enabling the cameras to zoom in on to number plates. “This system will not only capture the registration number of a vehicle but also dig out details of the owner from the database and find the exact place of offence with latitude and longitude coordinates,” said an officer.
