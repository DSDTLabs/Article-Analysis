GORAKHPUR: Laying to rest rumours that had been floating since Saturday about   extending support to   in   and Phulpur byelections, UP Congress Committee chief Raj Babbar said on Tuesday that there was no such message from the party high command. 

 "Dr   is our candidate from Gorakhpur and all workers and leaders are working devotedly to make Congress win," he said.
 
 Refusing to react to statements by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on the support extended by BSP to SP for bypolls, Babbar said that he was not scared of the CM. "I am in Gorakhpur and will not comment on the CM because of the temple and its dignity that he represented," Babbar said.
 
 However, he did say that the alliance between the two parties happened for selfish reasons and that even to defeat a communal force, an alliance based on selfish motives would not work. He said that 'certain forces' had been working together since 1989 to weaken the Congress and since 1993, these forces have been coming together, breaking away, colluding with BJP. 
 
 "BJP is a 'thaile boron ki sarkar' (a government of packets and sacks). Once it came to power, industrialists opened up their sacks of money for it. Despite 23 MLAs in Meghalaya we were not able to form the government. Despite defeating the BJP's CM candidate in Goa, we failed to form the government. Congress is not the party which allows loans of Rs 11,000 crore to people or can buy MLAs from other parties," the Congress leader added.
 
 He also said that doubts over malfunctioning EVMs only recording votes for BJP were not being addressed by the  . "They are asking us for technical proof and at the same time are not allowing us to open up the machine. How can we prove anything then," he said.
