VADODARA: If you have rented a house in the city and haven’t registered yourself with the police, be prepared to face action. 

 The   (SOG) has launched a crackdown on the house owners who have rented their properties but haven’t registered themselves with the police. The cops have been keeping close eye on all areas, especially sensitive ones, in the city to find out if any tenant is staying without proper registration. 
 
 In 2016 alone, the police registered 1,014 cases against property owners who didn’t inform the police about their tenants. “We hold such drives regularly wherein we do random checking to find out if any person or family is staying on rent without registering with the police. Such drives are important as sometimes people with criminal backgrounds rent properties and the owners don’t even have proper details of their tenants,” said SOG police inspector, H M Vyas. 
 
 The city police has issued notification which makes it mandatory for property owner to provide all the details of the tenant at the nearest police station. Those failing to provide such information are booked and arrested for flouting the notification. “We step up the drive during festive seasons to track down trouble mongers and also send across the message that we are alert. It’s more of a proactive action,” Vyas told TOI. 
 
 Though the drive is done in every area of the city, the SOG usually focusses more on areas near the airport and communally sensitive zones. During the   visits too, action is stepped up to track down tenants staying without proper registration. Vyas, though, said that they haven’t come across any case whether the tenant has turned out to be trouble-monger or history-sheeter.
 
 “Most property owners are either ignorant of the rules or are too busy to approach the police for registration,” Vyas said.
