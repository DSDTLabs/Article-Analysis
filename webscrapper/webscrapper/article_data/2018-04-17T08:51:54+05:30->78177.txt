Bhubaneswar: Cometh the hour, cometh the man.  , under fire for his lack of goals, rose to the occasion by netting the matchwinner against   in the 79th minute and hand   a berth in the final of the   at the Kalinga Stadium on Monday.

 East Bengal were never allowed to breathe easy by a side which was missing five key players through suspension and had only three players on the bench. To make matters worse, FC Goa also had to play the final 14 minutes (including the six-minutes added on) with 10 men after their captain and Spanish midfielder Eduardo Bedia was given marching orders following two bookings.
 
 Yet, Derrick Pereira bunch of bravehearts stayed true to a plan and slowed down the pace of the game. They were good in mixing their physical game with brilliant counter-attacking moves that threatened to upset East Bengal’s applecart.
 
 East Bengal, on the other hand, had to spend much to counter Goa’s strategy, and when they managed to break free the old sin of profligacy came back to haunt the red and golds. In the end, it was Dudu who made the difference and silenced his critics. It started with one of Katsumi Yusa’s trademark runs down the left. The Japanese sent in a measured cross, which Goa defender Mohammad Ali failed to clear. Dudu, lurking behind Ali, sneaked in to poke the ball into the net, giving goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani, who was later named man of the match, little chance to react.
