DHARAMSHALA: Eight villages of Kangra district with a population of around 10,000 are drinking unsafe water due to a irrigation and public health department (IPH) scheme which is still underway after incurring more than Rs 77 lakh . The scheme was formulated for 25 villages but still has   Khas, Bane Di Hatti, Bhangwar, Kut, Nad, Surani, Gujrera, Upper Nala which have not benefitted from the scheme.

 The residents of affected villages told TOI that they have been fetching water from natural sources as the water supply is dirty. “We have been complaining for two years but nothing concrete has been done so far. The village well is also prone to contaminantion and animals as it is left uncovered,” said a resident.
 
 Rajiana village chief,   told that the rivulet from where water is supplied is feared unsafe as the supply passes through cremation grounds. “We have one spring per 150 people and the resources of natural water are also limited. The only other way is to fetch water from other villages,” he said.
 
 Naveen Puri, the chief engineer I&PH department told that he was unaware of the situation. “We will take remedial steps and I will personally conduct the probe,” he said. Few villagers on condition of anonymity told reporters that the funds allotted to the scheme have been utilized and improper planning has stranded the work in middle. “We contacted the department several times but they do not take any action” said a villager. “The village water tank has a broken lid which invites monkeys’ taking dips in it or waste falling into it. It contaminates the water rendering it unfit for drinking” said Pooran Chand, Surani village resident.
