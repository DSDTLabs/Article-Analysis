NEW DELHI: The   parliamentary party meeting will be held at the newly-constructed party office at   on Friday and instructions have gone out to ministers to be present.

 
 To be chaired by PM  , the meeting is likely to be a marathon one as ministers will be asked to intensify outreach efforts to make people aware of welfare and development schemes.
 
 Normally, the parliamentary party meeting takes place in   every Tuesday when the House is in session but this one is seen as important as it is likely to discuss key issues in the run-up to forthcoming polls, including the 2019 general elections.
 
 The party consulted all ministers and communicated the changed schedule to them with a clear message that the meeting would be chaired by Modi in the presence of party president  .
 
 It will be the first meeting of BJP seniors after the defeat in Gorakhpur and   bypolls, which dampened spirits in the party just as it was marking the first anniversary of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 In a TV programme on Saturday, Shah had said the reasons behind the bypoll defeats would be reviewed. BJP sources said there will be a feedback session on the political scenario in the country in the first assembly of its MPs in its new party office.
 
 The meeting comes amid little sign of thaw in the deadlock which has marred the second leg of Parliament's budget session, which started on March 5 and has seen relentless protests by opposition parties over a variety of issues.
 
 The din has resulted in adjournment of both Houses daily without transacting any serious business. The government, however, managed to get the finance bill and a few other bills passed without any debate.
