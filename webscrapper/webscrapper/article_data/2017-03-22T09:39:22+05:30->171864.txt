VADODARA: The first annual meeting of the newly elected members of M S University’s   will be held on Thursday even as suspense over 10   continues on the campus. 

 Over a month has passed to the election season ending at the university and nearly the same time has passed to the state government’s decision of appointing five out of 15 of its nominees to the senate body. 
 
 But amid tug-of-war between rival saffron groups, the government hasn’t announced the names of the remaining 10 nominees which will complete the formation of the new senate body. 
 
 Like in the elections, in the first round of government appointees, the saffron group, which was otherwise labelled as rebels, had enjoyed an upper-hand while the ‘sankalan samiti’ which is usually the channel through which such names are recommended had to face disappointment. 
 
 After a long span, this will be the first senate meeting, where the ruling majority group, won’t face any major challenge as many old guards are missing from the new body. 
 
 Despite this, the ruling group called for a pre-senate meeting on Tuesday evening. 
 
 “It seems to be more of training the newly elected members on how to support each and every move of the ruling group without raising any objection or having substantial debate,” said a senate member. 
 
 The annual administrative report for year 2015-16, annual accounts of university for financial year 2015-16, annual financial estimates comprising the revised estimates for the year 2016-17 and the financial estimates for the year 2017-18 which have already been passed by the university’s syndicate body, will be placed before the senate members for their approval.
