KOLKATA: The 43% slash in budget allocation to   project hasn't dampened the spirit of   (KMRC) officials. With land hurdles that had severely crippled the project progress in the initial years now resolved and the project entering the final underground stretch, officials are confident of utilizing the entire Rs 1,100 crore allocated in this year's budget and showcasing the progress to demand an equal or higher amount when the mid-year allocation revision happens.

 "Last year, the budgetary allocation for the project was Rs 1,937 crore but much of the money remained unspent due to various land related hurdles, including delays in seeking permission from   and Archaeological Survey of India," an official said.
 
  
  
 
 With most of the hurdles resolved and permissions in place, the two tunnel boring machines (TBMs) operated by   for the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade underground stretch have already reached BBD Bag. The machines will complete the remaining 750 metres to Esplanade by March. Thereafter, another company ITD-ITD-CEM will use two other TBMs to drill the tunnels between Esplanade and Sealdah. Tunnelling between   and Subhas Sarobar is already over. Work is on in full swing for the elevated tracks on viaduct between Subhas Sarobar and   Sector V.
 
 "Things haven't looked more cheerful for the project. We have already completed 70% of this year's target and 50% of the overall project," a senior KMRC official said.
 
 The railways ministry is the majority stakeholder with a 74% share while the Union urban development ministry holds 26%. Till 2012, the state held 50% share and the rest was with the urban development ministry. Cost and time overruns have led to escalation of project cost from Rs 4,874 crore to Rs 8,570 crore. Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) is providing 46% of the project cost, which works up to around Rs 4,000 crore. The rest is being funded by the Union government, mainly the railways ministry.
