Singer   said she is   and follows a specific ritual before she gets onto the stage. 

 The 22-year-old   said she has reason to believe that whenever she has broken the tradition her shows have gone haywire. 
 
  
  
 "I'm really superstitious. First I'll warm up, drink lots of tea, hang out with my band. If people in the room have anything in their cups, they aren't allowed to cheers. Not just before a show, but ever," Lipa told. 
 
 "Before a show in Stockholm, my band thought it'd be funny to cheers with water before our show. I was so mad at them, and we went on stage and literally everything went wrong. Everything," the 'New Rules'   added.
