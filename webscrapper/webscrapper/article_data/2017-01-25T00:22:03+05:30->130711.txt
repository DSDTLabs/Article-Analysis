CHENNAI: At a time when the Chennai police are facing widespread condemnation for lathicharging pro-jallikattu protesters, police personnel say there needs to be some level of sympathy towards them for the gruelling work in the last two months.

 Starting with former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's demise on December 5, each cop in the city had been working more than 12 hours per day without a break, police personnel deployed on   said on Monday night. Jayalalithaaâ€™s death was followed by cyclone Vardah and the jallikattu  . All these called for long hours of work for the men and women in khaki. 
 
 The chain of events saw cops working 12-16 hours per day, instead of the mandated eight hours. 
 
 It all culminated on Monday when the protesters refused to listen to the request of the police to disperse from Marina Beach. The efforts to evict the protesters worsened the situation as they turned violent and police resorted to lathicharging mobs and firing teargas shells. 
 
 Several cops got injured during clashes with the protesters, and some of them were hospitalised.
 
 And for many the night did not end there. Cops were again roped in for preparations for the Republic Day celebrations on Monday night. 
 
 It was a scene of utter fatigue and exhaustion. Many cops could be seen sleeping, stretched out on the road adjoining Madras University in their vests, as they used their uniform shirts as bedsheets on the pavement.
 
 Woman cops had it tougher with many showing bruises from being sandwiched in between barricades, crowds and police in riot gear. Some of them said they had initially been posted near Ice House. Later, they were asked to move closer to Secretariat on Beach Road, when things turned ugly mid-morning. 
 
 These woman cops, who had been on duty since morning, had to walk up to the slums behind the bridge near Doordarshan Kendra and request the tenants to let them use the restroom.
