MUMBAI: Residents of three   high-rises got no reprieve from the   over restrictions placed on a road for  . A division bench asked the residents to give their suggestions, on restrictions placed on Colaba Woods Sports Complex Marg for construction of Cuffe Parade station, to   ( ). 

 In a letter addressed to residents, MMRCL had said to carry out Metro work in front of Taj Vivanta, it was proposing traffic diversions for five months. This included banning vehicle entry from GD Somani Marg towards the hotel and closing north-bound traffic on Prakash Pethe Marg from the junction of Vaswani Marg to GD Somani Marg. 
 
 Pervin Jehangir, a resident of Jupiter Apartments, in an affidavit said access to four buildings, including the hotel, was through the Colaba Woods Sports Complex Marg which was 40-feet wide and between 200-250 metres long. "MMRCL has put up barricades in the middle of the road reducing its width to less than 20 feet," said the affidavit, adding some officials had informed the societies that the width would be further reduced to less than 10 feet. 
 
 Advocate Robin Jaisinghani mentioned the matter before the bench on Monday evening and sought urgent hearing. He also pointed out the reduction in road width was in violation of development control regulations and would endanger the lives of the residents in the high-rises. "All vehicles, including those of the fire brigade and ambulances would have to go over the pavement," said the advocate.
 
  The court said it would hear the case on April 12, when other petitions on Metro-III construction are scheduled.
