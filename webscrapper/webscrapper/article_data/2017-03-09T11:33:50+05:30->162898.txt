PUNE: With the election of a new president as per the sports code, the   is all set to get back its recognition from the government and a thaw in relationship could actually see a windfall in terms of funding for the sport and the players this year and beyond.

 The sports ministry had withdrawn its recognition to the   last year when   was elected as President beyond the stipulated two consecutive terms of four years each. But Khanna, fearing a backlash, subsequently declined to take up the post and the federation eventually elected former IRS officer   to the top job in December.
 
 Now that the frostiness is in the past, the government is set to not only give its recognition back to the AITA but also open up its coffer. Accordingly , the sports ministry will fund 44 international events including five ATP Challengers and more than 20 ITF Futures events for men and women. 
 
 “We have submitted a proposal to the government and it's still being finalised. Once it's approved, we will know the exact calendar,“ said  , AITA secretary general. “The government is already supporting ITF junior events including some of Grade B1 level. The funding will take care of the prize money of all these events, which is usually half of the organising cost. We still need to raise the rest of the money,“ he added. Government's support will be a major boost for the players as tournaments in India dried up last year following the ATP's decision to increase prize money of events.
