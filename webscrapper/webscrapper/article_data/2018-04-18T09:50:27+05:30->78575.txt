BHOPAL: A special court on Tuesday sent   MLA   to jail for allegedly obstructing a public servant in performing his duties during an agitation in Indore. The Rau MLA has been charged under Section 353 of the Indian Penal Code in the case.

 When   constituted a fast track court in Bhopal for expeditious trial of cases involving politicians of the state in compliance to an apex court order, Patwari’s case was also transferred from Indore to Bhopal.
 
 In the previous hearing, Patwari had skipped court proceedings despite a magistrate’s court in Indore, which was conducting the case earlier, issuing an arrest warrant against him. When he presented himself in court on Tuesday, the court rejected his bail application and sent him to jail.
 
 “Not only he had skipped court hearing despite an arrest warrant pending against him but an offence registered under Section 353 is non-bailable in normal circumstances. We still believe charges against Jitu are fake and he has been framed but the court obviously has taken a strong view of his absence in the last hearing and the offence he is alleged to have committed”, said a lawyer aligned to Congress on condition of anonymity.
 
 However, Patwari was given bail along with other Congress leaders, including Satyanarayan Patel, Surjeet Chaddha, Pintu Joshi, Archana Jaiswal, Abhay Verma and   in another case. They were charged with breach of peace and creating public disorder during a chakka jam programme organised in Indore. The president of MP Congress’s legal cell,  , said, “It is more than a decade-old case. The court in its wisdom has decided to send the MLA to jail. We shall be moving the high court to grant him bail.”
