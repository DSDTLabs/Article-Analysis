Bhopal: In a major embarrassment to the   government, CAG has punched holes in the implementation of   (NRHM).

 Contrary to the state government’s tomtomming its “achievements” in rural health, the central audit revealed financial irregularities and misappropriation of central funds for the project. The Centre gave Rs 5,269.70 crore to the state in the last fiscal to revamp rural   but the state failed on a host of key parameters.
 
 Goals for infant and maternal mortality rates not achieved: Infant mortality rate (IMR) in the state was 51 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rate (MMR) stood at a shocking 221 per 1,00,000, way higher than the national average (40 and 167). The report said shortfall in providing maternal, child and reproductive healthcare services resulted in the failure in achieving targets.
 
 Maternal Healthcare: Out of the 93.72 lakh pregnant women registered for ante-natal care during 2011-16, only 52.51 lakh (56%) were registered within first trimester of pregnancies and 19.44 lakh (21%) pregnant women did not undergo three check-ups. As a result, well-being and the progress of foetal growth could not be ascertained in such cases.
 
 HIV & VDRL tests not conducted: HIV testing of 47.27 lakh and VDRL testing of 60.34 lakh pregnant women were not conducted. As many as 28% women were discharged within 48 hours of delivery in public institutions, says the report, and only 35.21 lakh (55%) mothers received post-partum check-up between 48 hours and 14 days after delivery due to the “apathetic attitude of service providers”, it adds. Against 93.72 lakh registered pregnancies during 2011-16, there were only 69.83 lakh deliveries. The case of missing deliveries may have an impact on the skewed sex ratio of 52:48 at birth in the state.
 
 Child immunisation: There was shortfall of 16-21% in targets set for child immunisation against seven vaccine-preventable diseases due to lack of awareness among parents and failure to mobilise women/children by the administration, the report points out. Out of 69.25 lakh live births, only 39.30 lakh (57%) infants were provided hepatitis B vaccine due to lack of storage facilities.
 
 Family planning: The State did not achieve the targeted total fertility rate (TFR) due to under-performance in family planning programme, says CAG. Against 3.03 lakh male sterilisations planned during 2011-16, only 0.83 lakh (27%) were performed. Female sterilization was a shade better at 43% and 22% of target (minilap and post-partum). There was a 42% shortfall in distribution of contraceptive pills and 49% in condoms.
 
 Short release of funds: Due to delayed submission of programme implementation plans and utilisation certificates by the state and Centre, only Rs 5,269.70 crore of the Rs 6,247.01 crore was made available for implementation of NRHM in the state.
 
 Lack of rural health centres: The state failed to create sufficient rural health centres due to lack of manpower and inadequate funds because of low allocation of funds, says the audit. There was a shortfall of 2,588 sub-centres (22%), 828 PHCs (41%) and 153 CHCs (31%).
 
 Lack of healthcare professionals: Out of 1,172 PHCs in the State, 503 were functioning without doctors as of April 2016, the CAG found. Laboratory technicians and pharmacists were not posted in 525 and 312 PHCs respectively. There was a shortfall in drugs and laboratory services, too. None of the test-checked health facilities had all the listed drugs and laboratory services as categorised under   Guarantee Yojana, the report said.
