Panaji: The Indian meteorological centre at Altinho has predicted heavy to light rainfall for various parts of the state in the next three days.  “An upper air cyclonic circulation over west-central and northwest Bay of Bengal is likely to have an impact on the rainfall pattern for a few days,” director, Indian meteorological centre, Panaji, M L Sahu said. The cyclonic circulation extends to coastal areas of South Odisha and North Andhra Pradesh, spanning up to 5.8km above mean sea level. It also extends to Konkan and its neighbourhood, spanning between 3.1km and 5.8km above mean sea level. During the last 24 hours, among all 13 centres, Old Goa recorded the highest rainfall of 62mm. A rainfall of 65.5mm is considered heavy. Other centres recorded light to moderate rainfall. There was no rainfall in Quepem. While overcast conditions prevailed since Saturday afternoon, light to moderate rainfall in most places during the last 24 hours took the seasonal total to 2,248mm (88.5 inches) reducing the deficit to 21%. Rainfall of 2,852.7mm (112.3 inches) is considered normal. A surplus or deficit of 19% is considered normal. The shortfall has persisted throughout the four-month period with surplus being recorded only for a few days after the monsoon hit the state on June 8. “We hope that the deficit will be reduced to a normal range, which is within 19%,” Sahu said.
