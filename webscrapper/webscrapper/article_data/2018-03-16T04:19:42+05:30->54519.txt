NEW DELHI: The Delhi high   on Thursday made it clear that   bylaws and heritage rules will be fully applicable to all restaurants and eateries in  .

 Justice V K Rao dismissed a petition filed by one of the eateries in the area that had challenged the decision of the authorities to shut it down for allegedly violating the 15m height rule of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as it was located near a protected monument.
 
 HC, refusing relief to the eatery, said the authorities must act against all violators. The eatery had claimed that it was located on the second floor of the building where other restaurants were allowed to operate and had sought similar relief for itself.
 
 After hearing the parties,   rejected the contention saying it “cannot claim any negative equality” and dismissed the plea challenging the decision of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to close the eatery and revoke its licence.
 
 However, the court told SDMC and other authorities concerned that if there was violation of any building bylaws or permission granted by the ASI, it “should be an impediment for everyone to run a restaurant” and the agencies must deal with all such violations with a heavy hand.
 
 “The respondents cannot close their eyes and allow illegality to be perpetuated by other restaurants in the same building. The respondents are required to take action in that regard,” the court observed.
 
 The restaurant had challenged SDMC’s August 17, 2017 decision by which its health trade licence was revoked and was asked to shut shop. The corporation had closed the eatery as it was running from a building that was over 15m high and was not permitted in the area as per the ASI norms. The other reasons cited by the corporation were that the eatery was being operated in an unhygienic condition and was catering to over 48 persons without any fire safety clearance.
