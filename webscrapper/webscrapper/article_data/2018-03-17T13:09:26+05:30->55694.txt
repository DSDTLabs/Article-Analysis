 and his wife  , who were blessed with a baby girl on February 22, have finally decided on a name for her and Cheteshwar announced it with a cute photograph on social media. 
 
  
 They have chosen the name Aditi for her. Cheteshwar tells us, “My spiritual guru Haricharandasji Maharaj suggested that this was the best option and we loved this name. ‘Aditi’ can mean ‘limitless’ or ‘Mother of Gods’.” With a smile, he adds, “In the first few days, Aditi resembled Puja more but now, she looks more like me. However, I am aware that when a child is growing up, the look keeps changing frequently for the first few months. My gut feeling is that she will look like Puja once she grows up.”
  
  Talking about his experience as a father, he says, “I am a completely hands on dad by now and I love changing nappies.   is among the most pleasing things in this world! When the kid is this young, you want to spend as much time with her as possible.”
