LUCKNOW:   chief Mayawati on Friday appointed her brother   as party vice-president. 

 Mayawati made the announcement during a party function held in Lucknow on the occasion of 126th birth anniversary of BR  . 
 
 Kumar, who has been facing an IT and ED inquiry into his alleged links to bogus companies, has not even been a primary member of the BSP. 
 
 The BSP boss also empowered Kumar to carry out party activities in her absence and even appoint members into party fold.
 
 Mayawati said that Anand was being deliberately targeted by BJP government at the centre to malign her and dent her politically. "But he did not budge to all the pressure. He once assured me that he would not succumb to ensure that party keeps up with its Bahujan mission...That is why I have decided to appoint him as party's vice-president," Mayawati told her supporters who had gathered at Ambedkar memorial in Lucknow.
