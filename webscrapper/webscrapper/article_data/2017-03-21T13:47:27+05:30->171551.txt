Bollywood’s sunshine girl 
  who recently turned 24 has been a people’s favourite right from her ‘Student of the Year’ days, and why not! With her cute-as-a-button looks and chirpy attitude, this girl has won many a heart, time and again.

 Alia, who has always treated fans with her frolic, is back with something really quirky and it is sure to make you go wow! The actress recently shared an animated toon GIF on Twitter and captioned it, “Getting ready to step into the virtual world! Coming soon :)” She’s seen shooting with a water gun and looks absolutely cute. 
 
  
 
 It may be recollected that a day after Alia’s birthday, her ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’ co-star 
  had shared a similar caricature of the duo and captioned it, “Badri toon @aliaa08 24 years of the dulhania.”
 
  
  Looks like this new trend on the block is here to stay!
