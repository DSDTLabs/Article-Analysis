Margao: In what exemplifies the insensitivity of the civic body towards ensuring the safety of the public, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), after keeping on the backburner the proposal of the fire and emergency services to have a dedicated overhead water tank in the town for fighting purposes, has now dropped the idea altogether.  MMC sources confirmed that the idea was dropped as the old fish market site that was previously identified to set up the tank, has now been earmarked for the proposed multi-level pay parking project. Instead, the MMC is now planning to install new fire hydrants connected to the newly laid pipeline that will supply water 24x7.  PWD official Vijay Kudchadkar said that following a joint site inspection by the MMC and PWD, the estimates have been sent to the government for approval. 14 fire hydrants have been planned to be installed along the new pipeline connecting the MMC’s new market and Gandhi market.  Sources in the know attribute it to the “lack of political will” of the civic body to act against a couple of illegal structures that occupy valuable space near the proposed site of the tank.
