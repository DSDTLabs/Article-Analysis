KOCHI: It took more than five years for the   to pass the Clinical Establishment  . It was the objections raised by private hospitals, various organizations of doctors and difference of opinion between legislators that delayed the enactment of the Bill. Now the health department should frame rules of the Act, but it seems to be a herculean task considering the hurdles it faced.

 The objections raised by private hospitals and doctors’ organizations are likely to delay the framing of rules. “The government has given two years for framing the rules. The duration is long and we suspect that the LDF government may not be able to complete the process before its tenure ends,” an official with health department said.
 
 
 According to him the state government should have limited the time to six months or so.
 
 But officials associated with drafting of the Bill said that they are hopeful of framing the rules within six months. “The government has stipulated that the rules should be framed within two years. We expect them to be framed within six months,” said an official who associated with the drafting of the Bill.
 
 The Act would now be sent for the governor’s approval. “Once, the government gives his nod, the legislation process would be over. Then, we can start the work on framing rules,” he said. The government hasn’t made it clear who would be framing the rules. “The work can be done either by health department officials or a panel deployed by the government. Then, it would require the vetting by the law department. The most difficult hurdle is hearing the stakeholders. Different stakeholders would raise different demands and prolong the process. It would be difficult task for the government to overcome the opposition by hospitals and organizations of various stakeholders,” sources said.
