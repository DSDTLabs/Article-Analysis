PUNE: The investigation wing of the  , Pune, has initiated searches at Sinhgad Technical Education Society on Karve Road and Shri Anand Cooperative Bank Ltd in Chinchwad in an alleged money laundering case.

 A team of 8-10 officers and staff are involved in the  , which began on July 25. “It is expected to go on for two more days,”   department officials told TOI on Thursday.
 
 According to sources, the case was discovered in the process of investigating the money-laundering case at the Ahmednagar-based Shri Renukamata Multi-State Urban Cooperative Credit Society, which allegedly used dummy persons — often from poor background — to transfer crores of rupees across cities. The investigation in this case is still underway.
 
 Navale did not respond to calls, text message (SMS and Whatsapp). His wife and founder secretary of the institute, Sunanda Navale, confirmed the search but said “she will call back as she is in front of the officials.” She subsequently did not return or take the call. Attempts to reach Shri Anand Cooperative Bank (which has a sole branch) was unsuccessful. 
 
 In April, the Central Bureau of Investigation had searched the office and residence of Sinhgad Institutes’ founder president M N Navale and two bank officials of the Central Bank of India for allegedly conniving together, which eventually led to a loan loss of Rs 58.04 crore to the bank.
