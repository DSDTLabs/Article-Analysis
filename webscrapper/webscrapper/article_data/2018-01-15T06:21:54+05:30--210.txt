LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh's Shivam Mavi showcased his talent to the world as India overcame their biggest hurdle in Australia by 100 runs in a Group B match at the U-19 World Cup at Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui, on Sunday. 

 Touching 145kph regularly, the Noida boy along with his new-ball partner Kamlesh Nagarkoti, rattled the opposition. Making the ball skid and swing with a whippy action, Mavi was unlucky not to get a wicket in his opening spell. He later returned to bowl a tight length-and-line spell to finish with three wickets, same as Nagarkoti as the two played a cat-and-mouse game with the Australian batsmen.
 
 Even former India skipper   was impressed as he tweeted: @imVkohli @VVSLaxman281 @BCCI keep an eye on two under 19 quicks ..mavi and nagarkotti..bowling at 145 in new zealand ..brilliant ..
 
 The two other state cricketers Aryan Juyal and Shiva Singh too played their part, but to an extent. Left-arm spinner Shiva plugged on with a lot of heart in conditions not very conducive for slow bowlers. 
 
 Though, he went wicketless, he kept things quiet with his tight length and variety. Juyal, the baby of the team at 16, made his Youth ODI debut, and was largely safe with the gloves after initially dropping opener   off Mavi. 
 
 Growing in confidence, he later held two catches behind the stumps, including that of Austin Waugh, the son of former Aussie skipper  .
