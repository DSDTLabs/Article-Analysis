RAJKOT: The farmers protesting Gujarat Power Corporation Ltd’s ( ) move to take possession of land acquired two decades ago, on Tuesday, took away their children from the local school in   village of   taluka and decided to discontinue their education.

 Parents of 95 students (53 boys and 42 girls) studying in classes I to VIII reached the school and submitted applications to the principal demanding the school leaving certificates of their wards. 
 
 Magan Shenta, principal of Malekvadar primary school, said, “The villagers said they don’t have money to run their house. They also said that after their land is acquired, they will have to do the odd labour jobs and wouldn’t be able to fund the education of their children. They have submitted applications seeking school leaving certificates.”
 
 GPCL has acquired 1,415 hectares of government and private land in three mining blocks — Ghogha-Surka, Khadsaliya-I and Khadsaliya-II, of the total 2,980 ha required. The remaining 1,565 ha will be acquired in phases once the power plant, which is to be set up by GPCL subsidiary   ( ), is fully commissioned. 
 
 The situation had turned chaotic in Padva and Badi villages on April 1 when farmers clashed with the GPCL team and police on Sunday, forcing the cops to lob at least 40 teargas shells and resort to lathicharge. The GPCL team had gone there with earth movers to begin mining of lignite.
 
 The land was acquired from 1,250 farmers in 12 villages of Ghogha taluka about two decades ago. The government has acquired the land in Badi, Padva, Hoidal, Malekvadar, Morsal, Thoradi, Rampar, Surka, Alapar, Khadasaliya, Thadsar and Lakhanka villages.
