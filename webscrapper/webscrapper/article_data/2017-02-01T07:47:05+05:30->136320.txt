AMRITSAR: “Meeting my young brother after his safe return from Pakistan is the happiest movement of my life,” said  , brother of Sepoy Chandu Babulal Chavan while talking to TOI on Tuesday.

 Chandu, posted with 37 Rashtriya Rifles, had inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan from the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir on September 29, 2016, when the   had carried out surgical strikes on terrorist camps in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The young soldier was, however, repatriated by Pakistan on January 21 via Attari border.
 
 A spokesperson of Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs had then claimed that Indian soldier had deserted his checkpost and crossed the LoC. He had stated that Pakistan government’s decision to return him was based on humanitarian grounds.
 
 Bhushan, along with his maternal grandfather CD Patil and brother-in-law Chetan Patil, was in Amritsar to meet Chandu in the Military Hospital.
 
 While expressing gratitude towards the Indian Army and government, especially the Union minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre, who is also the Lok Sabha MP from Dhule constituency in Maharashtra, Bhushan said he had last met his brother in June 2016 when he had come to his village Borvihir on holiday.
 
 Bhushan, a Sepoy posted with 9 Maratha in Gujarat, said that his maternal grandmother Leela Bai Patil had suffered a massive heart attack when she came to know about Chandu accidentally crossing over to Pakistan. “He was very emotional and was crying for her and so were we. It was indeed an emotional reunion of the family,” he said.
 
 However, he said the family didn’t get to talk about his stay in Pakistan and how he was treated. He said his brother was in safe hands and would recover soon from the trauma he had to pass through.
