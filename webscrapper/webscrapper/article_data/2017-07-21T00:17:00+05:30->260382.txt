Panaji: Goa University, which is facing a faculty shortage of 44%, will finally be advertising for 80 faculty positions this week, and for the first time the university will carry out its recruitment online. “The posts will be advertised on our website and applicants for faculty positions will be able to apply online for the first time. Online application is not only convinient for the job aspirants, it is easy for the university officials to screen the applications. And it becomes easy to segregate the applications as per the category like SC, OBC or assistant professor, professor etc,” said Goa University registrar Prof Y V Reddy. At present, 90 positions are vacant at the varsity and another 30 to 40 senior faculty members are due to retire in the next five years. GU had asked the state government’s permission to relax hiring criteria and recently received the go-ahead from the government, paving the way to fill up the positions.  The university has recieved permission from the state government to relax the 15-year domicile and knowledge of Konkani criteria, which are otherwise mandatory for hiring faculty at GU. Additionally, GU has permission to recruit assistant professors against the position of professors. There are many qualified persons at the assistant professor-level, but few or none available at the professor-level. GU now has the state’s permission to recruit these as faculty against the post of professor as assistant professors and give young faculty members the opportunity to rise to the level of associate professor and then professor.  In the absence of permanent faculty, the positions are being filled by faculty hired on a temporary basis. The code of conduct in force in June delayed recruitments. Until last year, recruitments was done manually. GU has also transitioned in recent years to the online admission process for students.
