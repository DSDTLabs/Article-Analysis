NEW DELHI: A day after TOI reported how a former   official tried to mislead the members into believing that the Union Government had extended support to BCCI for sending a notice to   on the breach of Member Participation Agreement ( ), it's now emerging that the campaign to pull out the Champions Trophy is losing steam.

 Sources said on Friday that the board is likely to announce the team for the Champions Trophy on May 8, a day after the board's   in the Capital on Sunday. It was revealed that the board members will meet the   (CoA) in two groups on May 6.
 
 The CoA could give the go-ahead for announcing the squad 24 hours after the SGM, irrespective of the decision taken in the meeting. "The CoA is against the pullout, therefore the outcome of the SGM may not really matter," a source said.
