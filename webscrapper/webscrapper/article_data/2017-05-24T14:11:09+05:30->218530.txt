NAVI MUMBAI: It was a slow start to the first ever civic elections for the newly formed   today, with just 10% voter turnout till 9.30 am.
 
 However, by noon, voting increased to 22%.
  
 "The elections are going fine in all the RO (returning officer) areas. There was a minor problem about an EVM at Kalamboli, but it was resolved," said the municipal commissioner, Rajendra Nimbalkar.
  
 More elderly and middle aged people were seen at the various voting centres in New Panvel, Kamothe, Taloja, Kharghar among others.
  
 NCP candidate Shivani Gharat, who is the youngest contender for this polls, commented: "I saw many young collegians at the voting centres during the early morning time. Since they had to attend their college lectures, they had come out there first."
  
 Interestingly, a 28-year-old Indian Navy personnel, Pushkar Mahalay, flew to Mumbai from the Vishakhapatnam naval base to get his finger inked at New Panvel. "I work as a storekeeper for our navy. But since voting is also important, I have taken leave to come here to vote," said Mahalay.
  
 Several disabled persons and those finding it difficult to walk due to injuries or old age were also seen at various voting centres.
