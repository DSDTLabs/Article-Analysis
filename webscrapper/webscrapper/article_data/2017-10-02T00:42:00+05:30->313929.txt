Madurai: The Gandhi Museum in Madurai was cleaned as part of the Swachhta Hi Seva on Sunday ahead of Gandhi Jayanthi by a team led by Minister R B Udyakumar and government officials.

 The museum, which earlier was a palace of Rani Mangammal, was inaugurated by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959. The sprawling campus houses many artefacts that belonged to the Father of the Nation. It is also one of the Peace Museums selected by the United Nations Organisations.
 
 Volunteers including students and members of political parties participated in the drive. Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao and Madurai Corporation Commissioner Aneesh Sekhar also participated in the cleaning drive. Many students complained that the party men who participated in the cleaning drive were standing behind the minister and officials holding bins just for publicity. 
 
 Though the museum is maintained well, public who visit the pace continue to dispose garbage on the premises. “Dustbins should be installed to prevent this menace,” said R Sundar who participated in the cleaning drive.
 
 Ministers Sellur K Raju and R B Udayakumar also participated in a cleaning drive at the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple. The district collector distributed more than 2,000 sarees and 1,000 dhoties which was donated by devotees, to patients at the Government Rajaji Hospital Madurai. The participants and volunteers also took a pledge to keep the city clean and free of garbage.
