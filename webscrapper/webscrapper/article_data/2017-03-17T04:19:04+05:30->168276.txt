MUMBAI:   spread over 15,000 hectares in the drought-hit   can expect to get water for their parched farms within a couple of years as the multi-crore   near Nagpur has finally got a further push after years of delays, cases of substandard works and cost escalations.

 On Thursday,   (VIDC) signed a Rs 1,058-crore contract with state-owned   (NBCC) Ltd to expedite the project. The agreement has been signed for the first phase of project that includes 25km of canals. 
 
 Gosikhurd still needs to complete works worth Rs 6,500 crore with a targeted 1.5 lakh hectares of land yet to be brought under irrigation. Of the proposed irrigation on 2.5 lakh hectares of land along the 200km canals of the project, only 50,000 hectares is getting water.
 
 “We are developing the project in phases and will gradually award the remaining works. The central vigilance commission will monitor the work,” said a senior irrigation department official.
 
 The Gosikhurd project has seen government spendings worth over Rs 8,000 crore with revised cost estimates crossing the Rs 16,000-crore mark. When late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had carried out the bhoomipujan for the project in the early 80s, the cost was Rs 350 crore.
 
 “The NBCC will take up survey, design, detail engineering and construction of the work that includes civic amenities aimed at rehabilitating villagers, construction of main and right bank canals and distribution systems of Nerala and Mokhabari lift irrigation scheme,” said the official. The work is expected to be completed within 18 months, excluding the monsoon months.
