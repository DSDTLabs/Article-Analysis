If you think Shubha Vilas’ 
  is just another religion-ingraining weapon, then you are sorely mistaken. The novel is an account of the   monkey god’s conception, his birth, his many adventures, and his might, in the most delightful manner. 

  The author builds up the story of Hanuman in a lucid narrative full of mythical anecdotes that trace the mighty Maruti’s journey across the earth and the godly realms. Attaining the shape of a bildungsroman, the novel projects the monkey god in both his agony and ecstasy. The book is divided into several distinct chapters, that culminate to provide a proper explanation of Hanuman’s power and his deeds, thereby establishing him as one the most powerful yet grounded gods. 
 
  There are chapters dedicated to the oral dissemination of folklore that gave birth to the several Hanuman temples across the country, thereby making the book “a reader’s delight.” 
  not only illustrates the Pavan Putra’s exceeding strength and intelligence, but also brings the readers, especially the younger ones, closer to the   and brings to notice the fantastical magic embedded in mythology.
