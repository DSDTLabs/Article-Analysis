Rashi Menda, CEO,  , talks about managing her work-life balance. 

 
 
 One shouldn’t worry too much about being a perfectionist because it makes you too involved with just one thing and ignore other things completely. Secondly, learn to unplug when you need to because rejuvenation gives you time to regroup and come back with fresh ideas.
 
 
  
 To me, being fit and healthy is important not just to look good, but also to be productive. I do strength training and yoga regularly, I love 
 dancing. I also watch what I eat. 
 
 
 
 Energy starts with the people around you, so my team at office and my family at home keep me positive and happy.
 
 
 
 Bit of both – there are situations where you have to gamble and go all out as it involves returns that are high. And then there are times where I study my options before taking a decision. 
 
 
 
 Work hard, have goals, but also be content with what you have, because happiness is also a state of mind. 
 
 
  
 Failures are the best teachers in life. I don’t regret any decision I took in the past because it taught me a lot. And as far as success is concerned, acknowledge and appreciate it and move on to the next thing.
 
 
 Communication is the key. You have to understand how to deal with the situation, have a plan with clear objectives in mind. Be honest and open.
