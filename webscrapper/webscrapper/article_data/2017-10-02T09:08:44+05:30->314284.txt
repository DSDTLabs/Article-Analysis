AGARTALA: Three media personnel were assaulted by miscreants at   area of the city on Sunday midnight while they were on their way back after covering Durga Puja idol immersions. No arrests have been made so far.

 According to police, two cases have been registered at   police station and an investigation has been launched. Allegedly, three miscreants of a local gang attacked the media team belonging to a local television channel at around 1:30 am very close to the police station. The victims have been identified as Debashis Saha, who is the owner of the channel, reporter   and cameraman  .
 
 A senior police official said, “We have been looking into the anti-social activities in the area for the last few days. About a month ago a local club tabled a deputation with police against the gang, in which incident Debashis Saha had a role. This may be the reason of the attack but we are investigating.” He added that both the parties have lodged complaints against each other. Police is investigating the case and appropriate action will be taken in due course of time, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, journalists’ bodies have condemned the attack. Demanding immediate arrest of the criminals, they said this is not separate from the ongoing spate of attacks on the media’s freedom of expression and speech.
