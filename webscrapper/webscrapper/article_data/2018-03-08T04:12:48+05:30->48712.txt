MUMBAI:  , the Kerala woman who had chopped off her breasts to protest against the inhuman “breast tax” in the erstwhile kingdom of  , was   by women achievers at a city event held on the eve of International Women’s Day.

 Eminent personalities, including lawyer-activist Abha Singh, radio jockey Malishka Mendonsa and environmentalist Elsie Gabriel, among others, remembered the shocking, yet path-breaking, story of feisty Nangeli who lived with her husband in Kerala’s Cherthala region over a century ago when breast   was imposed on lower caste women. “This meant that if a poor woman wanted to cover her upper torso with cloth, she had to pay a   tax to the king of Tranvancore. However, Nangeli refused to pay this unjust tax while still covering her breasts. This led to harassment from the king’s tax collectors,” recalled Gabriel of Young Environmentalists Programme Trust, which organized the event to honour over 25 women achievers on Wednesday.
 
 Nangeli chopped off her breasts, leading to her death due to excessive bleeding. 
 
 “We name so many roads and chowks after political leaders but why not after this brave woman who had fought against a brutal system over 100 years ago,” asked Abha Singh. Artist and physiotherapist Dr Kala Soni showcased an acrylic-on-canvas painting of Nangeli, which she had created recently. RJ Malishka said, “I learnt of Nangeli’s tragic tale last year through media and it shocked me.”
 
 Devi K Varma, secretary, Nangeli Cultural Forum, told TOI over phone from Kerala, “She fought the system when there was no women’s lib movement. She stood up to question as to why should she pay any breast tax to the king.”
