NASHIK: The petitioner of   pollution case,  , on Thursday filed a civil application along with the   about issues that he felt were important to be dealt with. The court said that it would hear the application with the original petition on June 6.

 One of the areas that Pandit categorically mentioned was construction of a retention wall on Nasradi River by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). City engineer UB Pawar sent an email explaining why the retention wall was being constructed and added that it was being done as per the new DP.
 
 “My argument is that NEERI’s recommendations were not included in the DP. The report of the sub-committee submitted by the then municipal commissioner with public opinion, objections and suggestions was acceptable to all and sent to the mantralay for incorporating in the new DP,” said Pandit.
 
 Pandit said that NEERI submitted a report in November 2014 prior to the  . On October 29, 2015, the high court directed NEERI to assess damages caused to the riverbed during the mela and submit report with further recommendations.
 
 To deal with the recommendations of NEERI, the committee headed by revenue commissioner appointed a sub-committee. The report of the sub-committee was submitted to the high court on January 27, 2016.
 
 He said that instead of the concrete retention wall, a Gabion wall could have been constructed like the one near Amardham.
 
 “The retention wall is part of protecting the river and the road here. We have a wall in the downstream of the river. We are constructing one upstream as well or else people will throw waste into it. Nasardi River is the dirtiest river and we are taking precautions to prevent pollution. It is also for protection of the river banks from floods,” said an NMC official.
 
 He added that the civic body had submitted its explanation and it will be scrutinised during the hearing on June 6.
