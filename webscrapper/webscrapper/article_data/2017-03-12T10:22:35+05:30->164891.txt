FAZILKA: Counting of votes concluded peacefully in Fazilka district, where Congress won from two out of four assembly constituencies. The party, however, suffered a major setback with the defeat of its senior leader Sunil Jakhar from Abohar.

 In a keenly-watched electoral battle in the district, deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Badal defeated AAP star campaigner Bhagwant Mann by a margin of 18,500 votes, while Congressâ€™s Ravneet Singh Bittu came third.
 
 In Fazilka constituency, the Congress wrested the seat from BJP as its candidate Davinder Singh Ghubaya, son of rebel SAD MP Sher Singh Ghubaya, defeated sitting minister Surjit Jyani (BJP) by a margin of 265 votes. However, independent candidate Rajdeep Kaur, sister of slain gangster Jaswinder Singh Rocky, also put up an impressive fight by securing 37,978 votes and finished a close third in the contest. 
 
 However, the result of the Abohar constituency sprung a big surprise as Jakhar lost to first-timer Arun Narang of the BJP by a margin of 3,279 votes. The Congress stalwart was aiming to get elected from Abohar for the fourth consecutive term. He had been elected MLA from the constituency in 2002, 2007 and 2012.
 
 The Congress also wrested the Ballauna constituency from Akali Dal. The SAD had given ticket to Parkash Singh Bhatti by ignoring sitting MLA Gurtej Singh Ghuriana from the segment. Nathu Ram of the Congress won from there by defeating Bhatti by a margin of 15,449 votes.
