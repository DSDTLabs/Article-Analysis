NAGPUR: A delegation of Indian   (IML) on Wednesday visited   department and demanded ‘ladder’ as symbol for their party to contest the ensuing civic polls. A senior official said NMC could not allot the   since it was not in the list of 48 free symbols.

 For the symbol of their choice, the party has to be registered with the   (SEC) in Mumbai, the officer explained. In this case, IML will not only have to register the party with the SEC but have to wait for six months, which is the standard procedure followed by SEC to allot symbol of choice to any political party.
