PUNE: Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ) will soon double the penalty imposed on drivers for talking on phone while driving, senior officials said.

 The transport body is also considering reviving the earlier practice of rewarding commuters for sending photographs of drivers talking on phones while driving. It was discontinued by former PMPML chairman and managing director Tukaram Mundhe.
 
  
 Ajay Charthankar, joint managing director of PMPML, told TOI that currently Rs 1,000 is imposed on drivers for speaking on the phone while driving. “We are seriously thinking of increasing the penalty to Rs 2,000 and it will be implemented soon. Talking on phones while driving is a major offence and it endangers the lives of many. While such incidents have come down, we need to be stricter so that the practice is stopped,” he told TOI.
 
 An official said the scheme of rewarding commuters for sending pictures of drivers talking on phones had been discontinued by former CMD Tukaram Mundhe and the reasons given by him were also quite logical. “It was seen that only a certain set of people received cash rewards, which gave rise to doubts. Hence, Mundhe decided to do away with the scheme and it was decided that the fine collected from the driver would be deposited with the employer’s welfare fund of PMPML. However, now it is being felt again that people’s participation is needed to identify offences,” another official said.
 
 PMPML is currently facing a few issues with bus breakdowns topping the list. There have also been some serious accidents and bus fires. It had been revealed recently that a majority of buses didn’t have fire extinguishers.
