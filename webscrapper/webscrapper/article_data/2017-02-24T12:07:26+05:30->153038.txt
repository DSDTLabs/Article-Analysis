NAGPUR: The   for admissions under   ( ) quota are on the verge of breaching the 20K mark in Nagpur district, creating an all-time record. Till Thursday evening, the education department had received 19,660   on its online platform, which will remain open till February 25. 

 This year, the applications have seen a 50% jump as compared to last year, when the finally tally was 13,639. Premchand Raut, a Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan official, who’s coordinating RTE admission process in district said, “This year, the massive response was clearly due to increased awareness among parents about RTE seats. The media too helped push the message to all sections of society, which played a key role in the response that we are getting.”
 
 There were some concerns that the spike in numbers could be because of duplicate forms being filled but Raut discarded that theory. “Duplicate forms are not being ruled out, but I would put them in the maximum range of 500. There’s no way that we can have thousands of duplicate forms floating around in the system,” said Raut. 
 
 The entire process of RTE admission has now been taken online and works uniformly across the state. In the earlier years of RTE admission, when it was offline, every district would chart out its own timelines and work to meet those deadlines. When the online portal was introduced, only select cities took it up, including Nagpur, but the separate date system was in place.
 
 In Nagpur district, schools in rural areas completed the RTE admission process in offline mode while those in city used the online portal. Now, the state has implemented a coordinated system where every school in the state follows the same timetable.
