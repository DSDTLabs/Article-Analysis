Bengaluru: “No rocket science, all basic.” That’s AB de Villiers’ description of his game and thought process. The 34-year-old’s conventional strokes mixed with unorthodox shots are anything but basic, but the South African insists keeping things simple is his mantra.

 
 
 
 
 “I have spoken to a lot of youngsters a number of times and they look at me as If I am crazy because I tell them, it is basic, keep it simple. Keep your head still, watch the ball and don’t think too much. And they are like no, that can’t be it. But, it is what it is all about — it is mastering the basics and then rest falls in the place. I have surprised myself throughout my career. It’s never been a planned act but all about the basics,” explained ABD on Monday.
 
 
 
 
 
 The former South African skipper keeps it basic and simple even when he has to deal with success and failure.
 
 “The funny thing with sports is that people always compare your value as a person in results, which is wrong thing to do. But it does make you feel good about yourself when you score runs and come into the tournament with confidence. There is a fine line between success and failure and for sportspersons, it is always important to remember that. I have learnt how to deal with success and failure over the years and not to let it spike it up and down too much. I have more of a straight line. It is important to stay in the moment and not think about what happened in the past. I am not playing against Australia and I am not thinking about my hundred (in the second Test against Australia last month). It is a nice memory. It is done. It is important to think about what is going to happen in the next game — how I am going to win the game for my team.”
 
 The mainstay of the   batting unit believes in putting pressure on the bowlers instead of soaking it in, especially when the bowler is menacing.
