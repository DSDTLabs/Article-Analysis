Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has razed illegal construction by Blues Adventure, a water sports entity of Goldie Hotels Private Limited, on the embankment of Tapi river near Singanpore. It took two days for the demolition staff of more than 100 workers to raze around 4,000 square feet of illegal construction of a hotel, office and a huge garden on the embankment.  Sources said that Goldie Hotels Private Limited, whose promoters Ishwar Dholakia and others are directly connected with the leading diamond company, Shri Ramkrishna Export (SRK) had won the contract from the SMC for water sports facilities in the upstream of Tapi river near Singanpore.  Blues Adventure is running various water sports rides in the upstream of Tapi. The space on embankment was only given for the water sports recreation, but the company illegally misused the space for commercial benefit by constructing hotel, office and a garden. It is learnt that the civic authorities had given the ultimatum of 15 days in Janaury 2017 to the promoters to raze the illegal structure. However, the promoters failed to obey the orders of the civic authorities.  However, the housing department of Rander Zone carried out the demolition exercise on Wednesday with the 100 demolition workers and razed the illegal structure to ground. The entire area on the embankment was encroached upon by the water sports company.  When contacted, Ishwar Dholakiya one of the directors of the Goldi Hotels Private Limited, was not available for comments.
