Visakhapatnam: Former minister and Pendurthi constituency MLA Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said the youth have emerged as the centre of attraction in this  , but they need political training just like the first generation of politicians underwent in 1984. Recalling those days, the MLA said, “We went for training after president NTR put up a camp for 15 days in Ramakrishna Studios and assigned famous persons like Tummala Chowdary, C Narayana Reddy and Papireddy to oversee it.” Yerrabelli Dayakar Rao, Venugopalachari, Indra Karan Reddy and others were in the training camp along with him.

 The teachers taught them how to prepare memoranda to government officials, how to address the public and even how to hold a mike and interact with officials. The younger generation of the party should get such a training, Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy opined. TNN
