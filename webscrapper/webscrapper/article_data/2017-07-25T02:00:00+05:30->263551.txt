PATNA: Gone are the days when people used to spend time on eating and enjoying. Nowadays they are more into fitness and many of them are even spending huge amount of money on buying equipment to burn their extra fat at home.

 Sources in fitness equipment business said due to time constraint, many people invest in  , aerobic cycles and dumbbells to burn the fat in their bodies at home as they cannot spare time for a gym or a walk.
 
 The owner of a sports equipment agency near Fraser Road said unlike five or six years back, when only the rich invested in fitness equipment, people from middle income group are also buying these items as per their needs. “This is the reason why fitness products are even out of stock many times,” he said. 
 
 He also said about 80% of the fitness equipment sold from his store are treadmills, motorized treadmills, aerobic cycles, weights, dumbbells and cross chairs. “Those who are not able to exert much buy yoga mats. People spend up to Rs1 lakh on equipment,” he added.
 
 Treadmills and motorized treadmills are available in the range of Rs30,000 to Rs1 lakh while an aerobic cycle costs around Rs9,000 and yoga mat Rs700, said Rahul Chhabra. 
 
 Vineet Choudhry, manager of another shop near Dak Bungalow roundabout, also said treadmills are sold the most. “People prefer home gym ware the most as they don’t have time to go anywhere to be fit,” he said.
 
 Manoj Kumar, a mid level executive in a private company, said, “People prefer aerobic cycle because it is comfortable and takes little space.” He added, “People of his generation realize that health is wealth and they are ready to invest on expensive fitness equipment.”
 
 Ujjwal Kumar, who bought a treadmill, said he hardly gets time to go out for jogging or walking. “That’s why I bought a treadmill for my house,” he said.
