BHUBANESWAR: A total of 14 road overbridges (ROBs) are under construction in different parts of the state currently. Out of these projects, work on only one ROB looks like it will meet the deadline. The remaining 13 projects are running behind schedule. 

 Of the 14 ROBs, the state government and the railways are building 12 overbridges on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis. The remaining are being funded by the state government alone.
 
 Official sources said work on eight ROBs - at   near Berhampur, Ranaposhi in Dhenkanal district, Budhapanka in Angul district, Gangadharpur near Balugaon, Bamulia and Soro in Balasore district, and Saheed Nagar and Pokhariput in Bhubaneswar- had been delayed by more than a year. The 1.2-km-long Saheed Nagar ROB extending towards   and Rasulgarh has, in fact, been delayed by three years. The Pokhariput ROB in the Old Town area of the capital city has been delayed by four years.
 
 The five other ROB projects have been delayed by one to six months. These are to be built at Gopalpur junction, Berhampur, Muribahal in Titlagarh and in two places in Rourkela district.
 
 A senior official of the works department said the projects were getting delayed due to several issues such as land dispute and design change.
 
 Works minister Prafulla Kumar Mallik said he had sought a report from his department about the condition and the status of existing and ongoing ROBs so that steps could be taken to ensure their safety. "I know that some ROBs have been delayed. I will review the status of all ROBs and expedite construction," he added.
