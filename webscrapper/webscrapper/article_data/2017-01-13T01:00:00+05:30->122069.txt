 is often spotted at fashion events in Delhi, with her father and   president  . Now that she has observed quite a bit, learnt a lot and completed her education in fashion and textile designing, she is all set to step into the world of fashion as a textile designer. Tanira completed her graduation from NIFT and went to London to pursue her masters in textile design when she realised she is interested in textiles. Her first project is on cashmere saris, which will be presented at an exhibitiin Delhi.

 "It took me a year to research and work on this project which is all about woven cashmere saris. Working on the fabric involved a lot of details and research, which is why it took me almost a year to come up with this. This idea, to work on cashmere as a fabric, was in my mind since the time I was a NIFT student. So, after completing my masters in London, I thought that I should conceptualize it. We keep talking about  , cotton and silk, which is good, but woven cashmere is something we have not explored. Also, I would see people wearing stylish dresses in winters, and not much variety was available in cashmere. So, I feel, this is something which needs to be be put forward as a concept," says Tanira.
