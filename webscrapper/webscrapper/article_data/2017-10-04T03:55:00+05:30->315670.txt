Panaji: Village panchayats of Penha de Franca, Salvador do Mundo and Socorro recently launched a programme to segregate waste at source in an attempt to make Porvorim a garbage-free constituency.  As part of the initiative, every house will be giveb two garbage bins to dispose wet and dry waste separately. The programme was inaugurated on occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on Monday by revenue minister Rohan Khaunte. Addressing the gathering, Khaunte said it is the citizens’ duty to keep their surroundings clean and also stop others from throwing garbage. “In today’s society every Indian knows about their fundamental rights, but have forgotten their fundamental duties. If everyone performs their duties, then most problems can be solved. If every resident does not participate in this segregation initiative, no change will come about, but the garbage menace will continue,” he said. He said that panchayats alone cannot maintain cleanliness and said it is the duty of the residents to cooperate.  Also in attendance were Socorro sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar, Penha de Franca sarpanch Swapnil Chodankar, Salvador do mundo sarpanch Sandeep Salgaonkar, zilla panchayat member Gupesh Naik.
