Surat: For any fresh graduate getting a job in a company through campus interview is a matter of pride, but not for this 24-year-old engineer. This electrical engineer soon after his selection in a campus interview was rejected by the company because he was found to be suffering from colour vision deficiency during medical examination.  Former student of Sarvajanik College of Education and Research (SCET) Nirav Makwana tried for several jobs in government and private sector companies, but got rejected for the same reason. Makwana also shelved his plan to do post-graduation in electrical engineering despite securing admission in top engineering colleges in the country after qualifying through GATE due to colour vision deficiency.  “I don’t know what to do. I am not getting a government job since I don’t come under the bracket of people suffering from physical disabilities. I never faced this problem when I was studying for my engineering. Hence, it shocked me when I was rejected in my first job due to colour vision deficiency,” Makwana told TOI. “I tried for a couple of government jobs where I was initially selected on the basis of my qualification and knowledge but got rejected during medical examination. Now I can get job in my field of studies in some small industries only,” he added. Makwana, whose father is a diamond polisher, started coaching students to support his family. “I am an electrical engineer yet can’t get a job in my field of studies due to colour vision deficiency. I don’t fit into other jobs either because of my qualification. I am in a strange situation,” Makwana said. He plans to make a representation to Gujarat Government. “I will approach the state government urging it to find a solution to the issue and if needed will approach courts,” Makwana added.
