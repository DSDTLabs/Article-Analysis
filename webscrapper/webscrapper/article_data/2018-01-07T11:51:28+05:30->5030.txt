ERODE/KRISHNAGIRI: Days after bird flu outbreak was reported in Karnataka,   animal husbandry department on Saturday set up temporary check posts on the state border to spray disinfectants on vehicles from the neighbouring state.

 Bird flu (H5 avian influenza) outbreak was reported at   village near Bengaluru in Karnataka a couple of days ago. Though there is no outbreak in Tamil Nadu, animal husbandry officials sounded an alarm to poultry farmers in the state.
 
 Following this,   and   district administrations urged district animal husbandry department officials to set up temporary check posts at Jujuwadi near Hosur in Krishnagiri and Bannari near   in Erode.
 
 “We have started spraying disinfectants on all the vehicles coming from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu,” said a senior official from animal husbandry department in Erode. Officials at the check posts have also been instructed to check trucks laden with poultry products such as corn, ground-nut and soya cakes from Karnataka without any fail as they are the main food for the chickens in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Meanwhile, poultry farmers in Namakkal district, the poultry hub of Tamil Nadu, have started to follow bio-security methods in their farms. “We are not worried about the outbreak of bird flu in Karnataka,” said M Velusamy Gounder, a poultry farmer.
