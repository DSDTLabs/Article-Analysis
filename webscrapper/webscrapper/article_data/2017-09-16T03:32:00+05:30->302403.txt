Panaji: For reappraisal of the evidence gathered in the Scarlett Keeling murder case, the high court of Bombay at Goa has directed the CBI to submit the statements of witnesses who had deposed in the children’s court.

  CBI’s senior counsel Ejaz Khan, told TOI that the bureau would comply shortly. 
 
 During trial, the CBI had examined 31 witnesses and had exhibited a large number of documents such as panchanama, medical reports and photographs.
 
 The matter, which came up for hearing before a division bench comprising Justice C V Bhadang and Justice Prithviraj Chavan on Friday, was slotted for next month after the defence lawyer said the CBI did not have any evidence against Samson D’Souza and Placido Carvalho, the accused. 
 
 The bureau had filed a special leave petition seeking permission to challenge a trial court’s order exonerating the duo in connection with the victim’s death on Anjuna beach in 2008.
