VISAKHAPATNAM:   president YS Jaganmohan Reddy staged a protest in Visakhapatnam airport on Thursday after city cops prevented him from coming out of the airport. After a sit-in for two hours at the airport, Jagan was sent back to Hyderabad in an Air India flight. 

 He along with   member and party general secretary Vijaya Sai Reddy, MP YV Subba Reddy and party official spokesman   reached Vizag at around 4 pm from Hyderabad to take part in the candlelight march on beach road demanding special category status (SCS) for AP. 
 
 Two and half hours before Jagan’s arrival, state police chief DGP N Sambasiva Rao reached Vizag and instructed cops not to allow anyone from the airport wanting to take part in the protest into the city. After landing in the city, Jagan staged a 30-minute protest on the tarmac before being shifted to the airport VIP lounge. City police commissioner T Yoganand met him there and updated him on the red alert issued by the central government, following inputs of suspected strikes in various parts of the country. 
 
 “When I briefed him (Jagan) about the situation, he asked me what he has to do. I requested him to go back and he voluntarily returned to Hyderabad,” Yoganand told media persons later. Jagan thenm boarded the 6 pm Air India flight to Hyderabad.
 
 Meanwhile, cops had blocked all roads leading to the airport to prevent YSRCP cadres from reaching there. 
 
 The scheduled candlelight march at 6 pm on Beach Road did not take place as most YSRCP leaders were in police custody. 
 
 YSRCP leader   and district president Gudiwada Amarnath were under house arrest. Former MLA Tynala Vijaya Kumar and leader Vamsikrishna were arrested when they reached the Gandhi statue near GVMC. PR
