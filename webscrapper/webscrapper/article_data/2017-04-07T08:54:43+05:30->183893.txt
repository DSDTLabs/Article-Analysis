NEW DELHI: Rakesh pulled up outside the OPD ward of   (DDU) on Thursday carrying his paralysed neighbor Manoj in a cycle cart from Subash Nagar. Mounting his 37-year-old neighbour on his back to carry him inside the ward, he found that there was no doctor present in the empty ward. It was the fourth day of the doctor's strike. 

 Manoj broke his spinal cord two months back while working at a construction site. "The waiting period for   was too long and we got an appointment for today here, only to find that there are no doctors," says Geeta, Manoj's wife.
 
 Although the hospital wore a deserted look, few patients came to the OPD to try their luck. Doctors were attending to those already admitted in the hospital but refused to cater to OPD patients or admit new emergency cases. However, nurses and other staff members had come to work.
 
 "My wife has been complaining of severe abdominal pain since last night. We have visited over three government hospitals they said that the doctors are on strike," says   (45), who came to DDU with his wife Gulab Thakur (38) from  . The couple, like many others, was waiting in the deserted lobby of the OPD, hoping for any good news. 
 
 The entry to the emergency cum trauma ward of the hospital is guarded by nine bouncers who claim that the security is tight throughout. Doctors, however, said that on the night when the family members of a patient assaulted their colleagues, there were hardly four bouncers on duty.
 
 Sumit Paria, president of the Resident Doctor's Association at DDU, said that their demands of better infrastructure and security are interlinked as more facilities will curb cases of negligence or delay that lead to such altercations.
 
 "Such cases of violence can be averted if there are more staff and doctors around and the necessary infrastructure is in place. Currently only two guards monitor 100 patients during the maximum rush of 8am to 2am, which makes us vulnerable," said Paria.
