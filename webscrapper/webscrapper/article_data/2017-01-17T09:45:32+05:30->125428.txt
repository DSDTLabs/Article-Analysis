 The first case was reported on January 5. Chief medical health officer (Nagaur) Dr   said that they have taken all the steps to prevent the spread of swine flu in the district.
 
 The last case of swine flu, reported in Nagaur, was in July 2016.

 If more such cases come to light, the department is planning to set up separate OPD counters for influenza like illness.
 
 “We are taking measures to identify suspected swine flu cases at an early stage. Early diagnosis and treatment will prevent mortality and spread of the disease,” he said.
 
 The health department has made arrangements for collecting swab samples for swine flu testing. “At present, we do not have swine flu testing facilities in district hospitals. But, we can transport swab samples from district hospitals to seven government medical colleges,   in Jodhpur and three private laboratories for flu testing,” he said.
 
 In Jaipur too, health department officials are on flu alert. “We have asked our officials in each block and also in Jaipur city to remain on swine flu alert. So far, no case has been reported from the city,” chief medical health officer (Jaipur) Dr   said.
