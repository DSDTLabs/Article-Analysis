HYDERABAD: With the city’s   not shying away from coughing up big bucks to get a thick crop of hair, Hyderabad has witnessed a mushrooming of hair-care   offering expensive  .

 Estimates suggest a count anywhere between 50%-60% in last few years, courtesy the steep jump in demand and enhanced awareness among residents. A quick scan on the internet shows the city boasts of at least half a dozen such centres spread across its length and breadth.
 
 Luring clients to doorsteps is an exhaustive list of promises on their websites from natural hairlines to speedy hair growth with the use of the latest technology.
 
 “Lately, hair is a priority for people. It is now considered a ‘pyscho sexual important organ’ for both genders. They are willing to go to any length to maintain their hair,” said K Bhavesh Kumar, assistant professor at Gandhi Hospital. He said, “At our hospital, 20 of every 100 cases that we get are related to hair. Apart from treatment, we also counsel patients on the importance of balanced diet and physical activity to maintain hair quality.”
 
 But footfalls at private clinics, hair-care centres are much higher. According to Dr Kumar, an employee at Dr Batra’s Punjagutta branch, the centre receives more than 650 customers every month, who opt for hair growth treatment. The average cost of procedure is between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000.
 
 “Most people who come to our clinic are youngsters. We also provide student discounts,” said an employee of one of these centres on condition of anonymity.
 
 While a debate on ethical aspect of such treatments, particularly using stem cell therapy continues, some doctors say the choice should be left to the individual opting for the procedure. “If people are willing to get the procedure done, what’s wrong in offering them treatment. Also, according to me, using stem cells to generate a liver is unethical, but using it for hair treatment is not problematic,” said J Venkateshwarulu, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital.
