CHENNAI: The cost of the Union health ministry's universal   could come down several fold, if Coonoor-based Pasteur   gets the  's nod to manufacture pentavalent vaccine. 

  The national programme delivers free vaccines to 27 million babies born across the country every year to prevent 11 life-threatening infections. Since 2011, the Centre had been using pentavalent vaccines instead of   (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccines in some states and now plans to extend it across the country in phases. 
 
 In February, the 110- year-old Coonoor-based institute, which once made DPT vaccines, sent its proposal to the Centre. "We know pentavalent vaccines will be used in the whole of India soon. So we thought it is best to produce pentavalent instead of just DPT," said director Dr B Sekar.
