Vadodara: The GEB Engineers Association has threatened to launch a stir against the managing director (MD) of Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited (MGVCL) for his alleged misbehaviour with engineers and staffers.

 On Tuesday, nearly 483 engineers went on mass casual leave to protest against alleged haphazard transfers and harassment of engineers being done by MGVCL MD Rajesh Manjhu. Even as the association office-bearers said that the engineers went on mass casual leave “voluntarily”, sources in MGVCL’s management team said that they have received nothing in writing. 
 
 “In the last one month, 400 show cause notices have been issued without citing any valid reason. It is against such behaviour that we will be giving strike notice on April 6 after which we will launch our protests,” said an association office-bearer. 
 
 A senior official of MGVCL however said that the issue has its roots in the fact that one office-bearer of the association was recently transferred in one of the sub divisions within Vadodara.tnn
