PUNE: The   was a “realistic one”, based on the estimated performance of income sources,   Kunal Kumar said on Monday. 

 The  , who presented the draft budget, slashed it by Rs 200 crore when compared with last year’s. Shrinking sources of income and increasing expenses brought on a trimmed version. 
 
 Kumar presented a budget for Rs 5,397 crore for 2018-19 as against last year’s budget of Rs 5,600 crore, the highest ever. It was Rs 5,199 crore in 2016-17.
 
 Senior civic officials said factors such as the estimated slump in income from   due to a slowdown in the realty sector, a drop in government aid and no fresh demand for a loan have reflected in the reduction in the budget draft for 2018-19. 
  
  
 The municipal commissioner had pegged revenue through development charges which are collected from developers and builders at Rs 1,025 crore in the curent fiscal. It was reduced to Rs 750 crore. 
 
 In the   for 2017-2018, the civic chief had projected an income of Rs 329 crore through various government grants. These estimates have been scaled down to Rs 219 crore in the 2018-2019 draft budget. 
 
 The civic administration has also decided not to apply for any loan in 2018-19 as against the loan of the Rs. 261 crore that was proposed for the current fiscal. The income from other general sources which was pegged at Rs 601 crore for the current fiscal is expected to go down to Rs 462 crore. 
 
 Though a big dip in revenue is indicated, the income from property tax, water tax and GST is expected to go up. However, the total shortfall will be around Rs 200 crore in 2018-19, a senior civic official said. 
 
 Kumar said the administration had faced tough days in the current fiscal but revenue collection increased in the last few months and is expected to go up further by March 31, 2018. 
 
 Presenting his fourth draft budget, he said a draft budget focuses on the city’s comprehensive growth with three vital components— its basic infrastructure for transportation with thrust on sustainable transport; planned water supply; and environment conservation with sustainable development.
 
 The budget has not proposed any big ticket projects for the city. The major allocations would be on completing the existing and pending projects.
 
 “About 90% budget allocation would be for completion the existing works and for projects that require more funding. The ongoing infrastructure works would not get over if appropriate funds are not allocated,” he added. 
 
 The budget has proposed expansion of citizens’ services with the use of digital platform to offer seamless services. The launch of a digital policy and enhanced allocation for sustainable transportation are some of them. 
 
 The budget has proposed Rs. 915 crore for basic infrastructure for transport, Rs 492 crore for planned water supply and Rs. 309 crore for environment and sustainable growth.
