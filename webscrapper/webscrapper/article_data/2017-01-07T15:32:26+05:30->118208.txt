BHUBANESWAR: The   (SEC) on Friday pleaded for the conduct of free, fair and impartial rural polls in the state scheduled in five phases from February 13 to February 21. 

 Reviewing the preparations for the rural polls here with the district collectors and SPs, the poll panel asked them to maintain political neutrality. "The district collectors discussed the challenges they are facing ahead of the polls. The panel will address every issue to ensure a smooth election," said state election commissioner  . 
 
 As collectors are the overall in-charge of rural polls in their districts, they have been asked to submit a master plan on the smooth conduct of elections by January 24.
 
 Elections for 853 zilla parishads, 6,665 panchayat samiti members, 6,801 sarpanchs and 92,029 ward members would be held on February 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21. As many as 2.60 crore rural voters would exercise their franchise. 
 
 The meeting was also attended by senior police officers who discussed the law and order situation, security arrangements at sensitive and hypersensitive booths and effective implementation of the model code of conduct. Nineteen of the 30 districts are Maoist-affected.
 
 To check the inflow of Maoists from neighbouring states into  , the state government has also asked the bordering districts to follow standard operating procedures. Since the Left-wing extremism situation is still challenging in Malkangiri, Koraput, Nuapada, Rayagada, Kandhamal,  ,  ,  ,   and   districts, the SPs were asked to be extra cautious.
