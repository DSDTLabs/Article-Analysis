NEW DELHI: With the fourth edition of the   winding up where Chennaiyin FC trumped Bengaluru FC to lift the title for the second time on Sunday, here's our All-Star XI from the tournament.

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 Usually the first name on any team sheet, Gurpreet has lived up to his top billing since returning home from Europe.
 
 
 
 Quite unusual for a foreign player to be used at right-back but Calderon's terrific show has proved everyone wrong, except Chennaiyin FC coach John Gregory.
 
 
 
  
  
 Chennaiyin FC's defensive rock, Alves formed a solid partnership with Henrique Sereno at the back. But unlike his captain, the Brazilian fouls less and scores more.
 
 
 
 FC Pune City helped Gurtej resurrect his career this season. The centre-back has been reliable and consistent, outshining those in the millionaire club.
 
 
 
 
 
 Not a name you must have heard at the start, but his surging runs down the flank as well as his solidity at the back make Lalruatthara an easy choice.
 
 
 
 Pune made it to the semifinals for the first time, and while the attackers got all the plaudits, it was Tebar's effectiveness in midfield that made them such a feared team.
 
 
 
  
  
 Dhanpal Ganesh wasn't even included in the team for the opener but the Chennaiyin FC coach was soon to realise his mistake. He was drafted into the starting XI for the next game and hasn't been substituted since.
 
 
 
  
  
 What do we say about this man? Bengaluru skipper Chhetri simply keeps getting better with every season.
 
 
 
 Doesn't have as many goals as he or his team would have liked but Udanta Singh can be a terror on the right flank. If there are any doubts, ask those who were assigned to mark him.
 
 
 
 With 18 goals to his name and two hat-tricks, no wonder everyone is now chasing Golden Boot winner Corominas.
 
 
 
 His partnership with Corominas remains the highlight of this season. 14 goals and six assists make him the best No. 11 in the  .
