Ludhiana: The Vigilance Bureau has nabbed a clerk appointed at the office of assistant sub-registrar, Cooperative Societies (East) for accepting a bribe of Rs 12,000 on Wednesday. The clerk — identified as Parminder Singh — was arrested from his office, where he asked the complainant to come with the money. 

 In his complaint to the police, Amreek Singh of Jartauli village — president of Jartauli Cooperative Society — said the society wanted to recruit a salesman, for which they needed approval from the cooperative society’s office. He applied for approval, but Parminder demanded Rs 50,000 from him. Later, the deal was cracked at Rs 35,000.
 
 Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vigilance, Rupinder Singh, said the accused had already taken Rs 20,000 as advance, and on Wednesday, the rest of the amount was supposed to be given. When Amreek Singh reached the office of the accused and handed over Rs 12,000, the team of Vigilance Bureau nabbed him red-handed. Further, the official said an FIR had been lodged against the accused at the Vigilance Bureau police station on Wednesday.
