Salem: In a gruesome incident, a 37-year-old drunken man murdered his two children aged 11 and seven by throwing them into a well following a quarrel with his wife at their house at Puliankurichi village near Thalaivasal here on Wednesday. Neighbours caught Saravanan, of Puliankurichi, when he attempted to flee after committing the crime and handed him over to the police. According to the police, Saravanan married Amutha 13 years ago and the couple has a son, Santhosh, 11, and a daughter, Kavya, 7. Saravanan, the police said, often used to quarrel with his wife suspecting her fidelity. On Wednesday, he came home drunk and fought with Amutha, who was in no mood to give up. When she left home in a huff, Saravanan, in a fit of rage, dragged both his children to a nearby well and threw them inside. Women in the locality saw this and raised an alarm. Within moments, a few men in the neighbourhood jumped into the well and brought the children out. But the two had died by then. “The children had died by the time the neighbours jumped into the well to rescue them,’’ the police said. As a large crowd gathered, Saravanan attempted to flee. But the neighbours caught him and handed him over to the police. The police registered a case under Section 302 of the Indian penal Code and arrested Saravanan. They later produced him before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody.
