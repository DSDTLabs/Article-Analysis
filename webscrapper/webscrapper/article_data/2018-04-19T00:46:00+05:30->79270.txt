Jaipur: In an initiative that can have a far-reaching effect, Rajasthan   have tied up with various medical units of the state for awareness towards early detection of cancer.

 The Royals, along with Tata Trust, will organise screening camps for oral, cervical and breast cancer at various locations in Rajasthan.
 
 The camps will start soon and some hospitals have already started putting up banners.
 
 The initiative, appropriately called ‘Cancer Out', will be conducted with the support of the Rajasthan government, National Cancer Grid, Indian Cancer Society and Indian Dental Association.
 
 The IPL match between Royals and Chennai Super Kings at Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on May 11, will promote the concept of early screening. Royals will be seen in a special jersey to promote the cause. A section of the stands will be reserved for cancer survivors and their families. Royals players will be actively involved in this initiative.
 
 “This gives us an opportunity to educate people about prevention of cancer by addressing its risk factors, the importance of cancer screening, diagnosis and early treatment,” Royals executive chairman Ranjit Barthakur said.
 
 They will be partnering health workers and NGOs to reach out to the people of Rajasthan.
 
 The Royals are hoping to tap the youth power to spread the message of cancer screening and early detection. “We hope to motivate the youth who come to watch our matches to go back and spread this message,” Priyanka Khanna, who is associated with the project, said. Arti, also working on it, hopes the popularity of Royals will help the cause.
 
 Data show that more than 100,000 new cancer patients are added in Rajasthan every year. Around 25% of cancer cases remain undetected. The mortality rate is as high as 70%. Any move towards early detection will surely brings this figure down.
