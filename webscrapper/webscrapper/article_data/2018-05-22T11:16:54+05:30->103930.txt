  :   officials have found themselves in a bind when they informed the municipal administration and urban development minister P  , during a review meeting at the GVMC office on Monday, that four schools in the city are being operated in   due to lack of sufficient space. 

 Narayana said that it is unfortunate that four schools in a city like Visakhapatnam are still being run in shifts, even 70 years after Independence. 
 
 Replying to the minister, GVMC commissioner   said that they will hire a private school and shift the students temporarily and construct a multi-storied building to accommodate all the students in one shift.
