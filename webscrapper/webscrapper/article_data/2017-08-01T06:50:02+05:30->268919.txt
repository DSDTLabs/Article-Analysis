KOLKATA: This July has been the second wettest in Kolkata since 2008 with rain count clocking a phenomenal 72% above the normal mark. Last month, the city has received 621.5mm rain. Only once — in 2015 — in the last decade has Kolkata received more rain in July. 

 Regular cycles of low pressure and the presence of monsoon trough in south Bengal have triggered the unusually heavy rain. Both factors have rarely been so active in recent years, pointed out weathermen. “These two combined to uniform showers through the month that has not happened in the last decade. The only exception was 2015 when cyclone Komen, which had struck Bangladesh, led to heavy  . It had pushed up the rain volume to 84% above normal. But strictly speaking that was not a classical monsoon rainfall,” said GK Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). 
 
 Till July 24, Kolkata had received 98% more rain than normal. Three days prior to that, the excess stood at 52%. The normal July rain count in Kolkata is 361 mm. “Active monsoon trough made the difference this time. It continued to pass through the Gangetic West Bengal for a considerably long period. This turned the tide after a relatively dry beginning to the season,” said Das. 
 
 But the healthy July excess didn’t necessarily indicate that the season, too, will end with an excess. The seasonal excess has been 35% so far. “It could drop if the rain volume shrinks over the next two months,” said Das.
 
 The monsoon trough has shifted northward from Gangetic Bengal. It has already led to a drop in the volume of rain. But two low-pressure systems now brewing in the region are keeping rain hopes alive, said the RMC. “One stretches from north Bengal to the north Bay of Bengal. Another extends from the north Bay to the Odisha coast and Gangetic Bengal. These would trigger rain in the region, but it won’t be very heavy,” added Das.
