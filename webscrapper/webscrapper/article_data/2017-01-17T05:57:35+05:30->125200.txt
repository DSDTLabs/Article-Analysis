MUMBAI: Two minor boys were among three people arrested for allegedly burning their friend's face partially by sprinkling   on him on Saturday. 

 The police said that the accused used to bully their friend, a businessman's son, into giving them money. The friend studies in class IX of a south Mumbai school. 
 
 Acetone is used as nail polish remover. The police said that they are probing if the boys had mixed some other chemical in the acetone which could have caused the burns.
 
 The incident took place around 8.30 pm in  . "We arrested Ziyad Siddiqui (18) and the minor boys for attempt to kill. The minors have been sent to the remand home and Siddiqui is in police custody till Tuesday," said a police officer.
 
 The officer said that the three boys often demanded money from their friend. "On Saturday, they asked for money, but the friend refused. This angered the boys who flung the acetone," said the officer. 
 
 The boy, who has burns to the left side of the face, has been admitted hospital. The bottle in which the acetone was brought will be sent for analysis to the state forensic science laboratory in Kalina, said the police.
