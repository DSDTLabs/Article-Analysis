VADODARA: Days after exam controller of Waghodiya-based   was arrested by anti-corruption bureau ( ) in connection with the cash-for-marks scam, the chief accounts officer ( ) of the institute has filed for anticipatory bail in court here.

 Purvi Mahant, the chief accounts officer, has sought anticipatory bail from the court after Dr   was arrested by ACB sleuths. Interestingly, both   and   were not named as accused in the original complaint. In fact, the two chargesheets which were filed by ACB officials in the court did not have names of the two as accused. However, the ACB had taken their statements during the course of investigation.
 
 The court will hear Mahant’s anticipatory bail plea on February 2. But on what grounds has she sought bail in spite of not being an accused was not known. Time and again Mahant’s name had been mentioned in the affidavits which the investigating officers submitted opposing bails of the accused. However, the affidavits never had mention of Mahant’s direct involvement in the crime.
 
 The scam at the institute was unearthed in February last year after parents of a final year MBBS student approached ACB when they were asked to give Rs 20 lakh to enable their daughter to take the exam. The founder-president and kingpin in the case   was arrested with his two aides   alias Bharat Savant and late Ashok Tailor.
