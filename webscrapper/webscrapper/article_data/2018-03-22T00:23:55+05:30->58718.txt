   has been entrusted with the responsibility of guiding   at the   after chief coach Sergio Lobera packed his bags and returned home to be with his wife, expected to deliver their first child later this month.
 
  Lobera, the youngest coach in the Indian Super League, surpassed expectations in this edition of ISL by taking FC Goa to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Chennaiyin FC.
  
  There were a lot of questions being asked about Lobera’s ability to succeed at this level but the former Barcelona man did his reputation no harm by putting together a side that ended up as the best attacking team in the league by quite some distance.
  
  He won’t be around to mastermind another attacking show in the season-ending Super Cup but FC Goa officials believe the team is in the safe hands of Derrick, his assistant and a reputed name in Indian  .
  
  “The team has taken a short break and will converge (in Goa) again on March 26. It’s been a tiring campaign, so everyone has returned home. Once they return, Derrick will take charge and he is as good as anyone else here,” said a senior club official.
  
  The Super Cup allows teams to register only six foreign players. There are currently eight foreign players at FC Goa and sources said Dutch striker Mark Sifneos and Moroccan midfielder Ahmed Jahouh will not be part of the squad.
  
  “Sifneos is surplus to requirements here with so much of attacking talent at our disposal. Jahouh has played every game in the ISL and needs a break. We have Edu (Bedia) who can cover-up for him in that position,” said the official.
  
  Jahouh was among the more influential players in the ISL and led the charts for most passes (1625; Edu Bedia next on the list with 1219) and most tackles (105; Mumbai City captain Lucian Goian next with 85). He played 19 of the 20 matches for Goa, missing just one game through suspension.
  
  Goa play ATK in the Super Cup pre-quarterfinals at the Kalinga Stadium, Bhubaneswar, on April 3.
