Visakhapatnam: The traffic police carried out special drink driving tests throughout the city on New Year’s eve, and booked several motorists for driving under the influence of the alcohol.

 According to J Prabhakar, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), more than 100 special traffic personnel were pressed into service at 50 spots in the city to keep a tab on the zig-zag and rash driving by youngsters at key junctions in the city like RK beach, Rushikonda beach road, Bheemili road, Dwaraka bus station, flyover, national highway stretch in the city limits, BRTS road from Hanumanthawaka junction to Simhachalam among other areas.
 
 Prabhakar said though they have insufficient number of staff, they took up the drink driving drive in the city for sake of motorists as well as for others like pedestrians and the general public. He said the drive will continue till 5 am on Monday (January 1).
 
 “A man died on the flyover in the city on New Year’s eve last year after losing control of his vehicle. He was found to be under the influence of alcohol. We don’t want people meeting the same fate,” said a senior cop at the Dwaraka police station.
 
 According to city police, on an average nearly 1,200 cases related to drink driving are booked by traffic cops per month. As many as 200 drunk drivers were caught on New Year’s eve in 2017, the police said, adding that the number may go up this time due to the increased number of checking spots.
 
 The police said besides drink driving tests, they have also deployed stationary, mobile and decoy teams who will have the power to take videos of the offenders for evidence. “All vehicles caught during the checks will be seized and the drivers will be detained on the spot,” Prabhakar added.
