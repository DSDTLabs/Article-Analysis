NEW DELHI: June quarter   of IT majors   and   offer a glimpse on   outlook for the sector, which is not as bad as many thought.
 
  The Indian IT industry has been reducing manpower mainly for cost savings in a weak demand environment, while automation and shift in focus among clients from legacy properties to new technologies has also led to a lot of job churns.
  
  Fineprints of June quarter earnings suggest the scale of layoffs may or may not be as drastic as some had prophesied earlier, but hirings will grow slower and salary growth muted.
  
  Data suggests TCS and Infosys, which together employ about 6 lakh people the world over, saw a contraction in gross employee addition during June quarter, with combined headcounts falling to 584,362 at the end of June from 587,587 at the end of March.
  
  TCS’ total headcount fell to 385,809 in Q1 from 387,223 at the end of Q4, while that of Infosys declined to 198,553 from 200,364.
  
  Gross additions by Infosys dropped to 8,645 in June quarter from 9,130 in March quarter and 13,268 in the year-ago quarter. In the whole of FY17, the company had added 37,915 employees on a gross basis.
  
  Data suggests the headcount in the software space fell to 186,882 from 188,665 in the March quarter.
  
  However, on a YoY basis, this number improved a bit.
  
  The company’s attrition rate stood at 21 per cent in June quarter, compared with 17.1 per cent in March quarter, and a similar level in the year-ago quarter.
  
  Infosys also reported a drop in the number of trainees, which stood at 3,618 at the end of June quarter compared with 5,438 at the end of March quarter and 6,580 in the year-ago quarter. Revenue per employee for the IT major rose on both sequential and YoY basis (See table), suggesting lesser number of people per contract.
  
  
  
  
  TCS reported a gross addition of 11,202 employees in June quarter compared with 20,093 additions in March quarter. The IT major had reported 78,912 gross additions in the whole of FY17.
  
  
  
  
  
  The Indian IT industry employs an estimated 3.86 million employees, accounting for a significant share of private sector jobs in the country.
  
  “The five years preceding the great financial crisis of 2008(GFC), saw IT/ITeS employment increase at a CAGR of 24 per cent, grabbing much attention. However, the subsequent slowdown in the US and euro zone has considerably affected the pace of hiring,” JM Financial said in a note.
  
  “Indian IT companies have been compelled to explore innovations in delivery models to remain competitive (on pricing) with minimal impact on project margins, as clients’ IT spends continue to be opportunistic and there is a constant drive to fund new technology investments through cost savings on maintenance of legacy technology platforms,” the brokerage said.
  
  
  
  
  McKinsey & Company in a recent said nearly half of the workforce in the IT services firms to be ‘irrelevant’ over the next three to four years.
  
  Executive search firm Head Hunters India said the job cuts in the IT sector will be between 1.75 lakh and 2 lakh annually over next three years due to under-preparedness of the industry in adapting to newer technologies.
  
  “Contrary to media reports of 56,000 possible job losses in the IT sector this year, the actual job cuts will be between 1.75 lakh and 2 lakh per year over next three years,” a PTI report quoted Head Hunters India Founder-Chairman and MD K Lakshmikanth as saying.
  
  McKinsey India Managing Director Noshir Kaka recently said the bigger challenge ahead for the industry will be to retrain 50-60 per cent of the workforce, as there will be a significant shift in technologies. The industry employs 3.9 million people and the majority of them have to be retrained.
