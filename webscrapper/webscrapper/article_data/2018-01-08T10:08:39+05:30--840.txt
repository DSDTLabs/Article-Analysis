MOHALI: Before going to slap an FIR (first-information report) on those who let   into the city, the municipal corporation has issued a notice of warning to 166 dairy owners under Section 188 (general bylaws) of the Punjab Municipal Act.

 Municipal commissioner   said in the last MC house meeting that the notice had been issued on December 5 and political motives should not be ascribed to the action, which “should not be on party lines”. “Stray cattle damage the city’s environment and threaten the public. We have warned the dairy owners not to let their herds loose. After January 7, we will impound the stray animals and register cases against the keepers.”
 
 Dairy owners are known to leave their cattle out to graze in the city after milking. The cows and buffaloes ravage the parks, invade people’s lawns, litter the roads, interrupt traffic, topple dustbins, and gore many commuters. The MC plans to regulate the cattle-rearing business to be able to dissuade the dairy farmers from letting their herds wander.   said 166 dairy owners had kept 1,908 cattle heads within the MC limits.
 
 The civic body will register all the dairies and issue a tag for each cattle head to be able to identify its owner for penal action. In the house meeting, mayor   asked the councillors to drop their “double standards over the stray cattle issue”. He said: “In the house, the members raise a voice for catching stray cattle but when the MC team impounds any wandering herd, they ring up officers and tell them to free it.”
