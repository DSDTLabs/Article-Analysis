 JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) organised a cultural event at Freedom Square despite a notice to the office-bearers not to conduct the programme within 100 metres of the administrative block as per university rules and high court order.
 
 “Members of JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) held a meeting on Monday and it was decided that the boycott of the compulsory attendance will continue,” said JNU teacher Pradip Shinde. 
 
 Shinde added that the teachers wrote to the administration for a dialogue, but received no response.
 
 Students of centres like School of Languages, Social Sciences and International Studies were seen sitting in the halls, staircases and walkways responding to the call for strike.
 
 “For us education is important. At JNU, students don’t need to follow a strict attendance rule and many of us study subjects other than ours,” a student said. Expressing dissent, a teacher said, “You cannot set up a system forcefully for students.”
