JABALPUR: Former union minister   has said that investigation agencies of the country are being misused against people with different ideologies.   made this statement while taking to mediapersons in   on Wednesday.

 Sinha had come to Jabalpur for going to neighbouring   district, where he will participate in the protest by farmers against the proposed   power plant in   tehsil on Thursday. 
 
 “The investigation agencies are being misused against people with different ideologies. This has created an environment of fear in the entire country. I am fighting for the cause of farmers in Narsinghpur as a citizen of this country. It seems that no one is concerned about the condition of farmers. The economic survey of the government has revealed about the problems of unemployment, education and farmers, but these issues have not come up overnight, it is clear from these facts that the government has failed on these fronts”, Sinha said.
 
 When asked about his ‘anti-party comments’, Sinha said, “My protests are against the policies, not against any party or any individual. I will not quit the party, the party can remove me if it feels I am wrong. The state administration has been insensitive towards the farmers problems in Gadarwada,” Sinha said.
