NEW DELHI: Following the merger of different media units under   ( ), the government has started reallocating work after creating four sections under the newly created body. Through an order issued recently, the information and broadcasting ministry created four sections under BOC—two Media Unit Cells (MUCs), Information Policy and Media Coordination (IP&MC) Section and a Press Section that deals with all matters relating to Press Information Bureau, Press Council of India and the government’s photo division. 

 
 In December 2017, the ministry had merged the directorate of field publicity, song and drama division and directorate of advertising and visual publicity (DAVP) to form BOC. The integration, the government said, has resulted in a consolidation of regional and field units with a DG-level officer of   leading BOC in Delhi, and assisted by eight zonal DGs. 
 
 All policy matters, matters relating to finances, legal issues,   questions, annual reports and cabinet notes will now be handled by MUC- I and II, while IP&MC section will tackle matters relating to   (IIMC) run by the ministry. 
 
 The government had said that setting up of BOC replaces the Delhi-centric approach and turns the ministry’s attention to hitherto uncovered areas. Sources said BOC will also focus on building communication in regional languages and creating content to connect better with local populations. As a part of the initiative, the ministry has also created an online system of integrated media campaign that relies heavily on inputs by client ministries regarding their target audiences. 
 
 “The online system will later graduate into an automated system of payment to news/TV agencies carrying advertisements, thereby reducing backlogs and ensuring timely payments,” a government statement said.
