New Delhi: Congress on Thursday demanded that HRD minister Prakash   and   chairperson Anita Karwal be sacked even as it blamed the CBSE exam   leak on a “weak prime minister”.

 The party demanded an independent judicial probe into the controversy, arguing that a failure to do so would prove that the government was hiding something.
 
 Claiming that there were leaks galore, from data to Aadhaar to SSC paper to election dates under the BJP regime, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Har cheez me   hai, chowkidar weak hai (there is leak in every issue, the watchman is weak).”
 
 “Watchman” has become a shorthand for PM Narendra Modi who had branded himself thus during the 2014 election campaign. Rahul said the paper leak had destroyed the “hope and future” of millions of students and warned that “this is what happens when institutions are destroyed by the RSS/BJP. Believe me when I say, this is only the beginning”.
 
 The principal opposition party said the leak was directly linked to the government’s decision to change the system under which three sets of examination papers were prepared. “Why did HRD ministry/CBSE resort to setting one paper with identical questions across the country? Why did HRD ministry/CBSE do away with the practice of dividing the country into four zones to prevent copying, cheating and leaking of papers?” Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala asked.
 
 Congress slammed the Centre for what it called laxity and favouritism in running the CBSE. It said the post of CBSE chairperson was vacant for two years under former HRD minister Smriti Irani. It said R K Chaturvedi was appointed to the post in July 2017, only to be replaced with Anita Karwal in August 2017.
