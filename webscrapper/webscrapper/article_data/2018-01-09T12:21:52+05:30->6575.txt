CHENNAI: The   on Tuesday refused to restrain sidelined AIADMK leader TTV   from attending the ongoing session of the   and to suspend the results of the   declared on December 24, 2017. 

 "Courts cannot suspend election results once they were declared. Such relief can be sought only through an election petition under the Representation of People Act," the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee said while dismissing a public interest litigation moved by advocate S V Ramamurthy. 
 
 The petitioner wanted the court to direct the Election Commission of India (ECI) to suspend the results of the RK Nagar byelection and to restrain Dhinakaran from acting as the legislator of the constituency in the ongoing assembly session, in view of the allegations of electoral malpractices levelled against him. The allegations against him include bribing the voters in the constituency.
 
 In his petition, Ramamurthy said Dhinakaran, who was an independent candidate in the byelection, had managed to win it by indulging in electoral malpractices. He was also facing criminal proceedings for allegedly trying to bribe ECI officials to secure a favourable order in the two leaves symbol case, he added.
 
 The petitioner said the ECI had admitted that it had seized around Rs 30 lakh from the constituency meant to be distributed to the voters.
 
 "Though major political parties have said that it was actually the ECI which faced defeat in the byelection and (they) have filed complaints of malpractices against Dhinakaran, no action has been initiated against him so far. Even my representation dated December 29, 2017 has not received any response from the ECI so far, prompting me to approach the high court," Ramamurthy said.
