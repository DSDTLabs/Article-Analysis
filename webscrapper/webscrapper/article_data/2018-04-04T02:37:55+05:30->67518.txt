NEW DELHI:   from a team of   helped a 56-year-old patient get a new lease of life as the doctors carried out a   within three hours of harvesting from a   in Jaipur.

 “The patient is recovering well after the successful transplant,” said Dr Ajay Kaul, chairman and head of department, cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTVS), BLK Super Speciality Hospital, who led the team of doctors harvest the heart and transplant it.
 
 The patient — a government employee from Kanauni village of Ghaziabad — was suffering from an incurable condition called dilated cardiomyopathy.
 
 The heart transplant became possible as a 30-year-old man was declared brain-dead at SMS hospital in Jaipur, following a road accident. While the kidneys and eyes were used in Jaipur only, liver and heart were sent to Delhi.
 
 The doctors at BLK hospital swung into action when the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) informed them about the donor and availability of a heart.
 
 Kaul and his team left for Jaipur by an early morning flight on Monday and harvested the heart at night. They reached Delhi with the heart at 10.47pm, the hospital said.
 
 A green corridor was created from IGI airport to BLK hospital — covering a distance of 15km in around 18 minutes. The heart was transplanted late into the night. “The recipient was suffering from heart complications for past few years. A pacemaker was implanted in July last year. The patient used to have bouts of blackouts and would faint after four to five months of the pacemaker implant,” said Kaul, adding that heart transplant was an ideal option.
