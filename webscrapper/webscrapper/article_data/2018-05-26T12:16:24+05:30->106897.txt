BENGALURU: Anxious families may have been waiting for a homecoming on Friday as   and JD(S) MLAs — corralled in resorts and hotels since results were announced — were “allowed” to go where they pleased after the 
  . But many legislators had thoughts other than a homely meal and a good night’s sleep. They took the next flight out to Delhi in the hope of moving the high command for a cabinet berth.

 
 Until Thursday, most Congress MLAs had claimed to be homesick and were pressuring the leadership to be allowed to return to their families. But following the trust vote, as discussions began among Congress and JD(S) leaders on distribution of ministries, with talk of the negotiators heading to Delhi next, Congress MLAs saw more merit in rushing to the headquarters.
 
  
  
 
 After dinner with   at the legislature party office in Vidhana Soudha, JD(S) MLAs so far put up at a resort headed home since Kumaraswamy’s will is certain to prevail. 
 
 But claimants in Congress for the 21 berths (excluding the deputy chief minister’s post) geared up to push their case. Congress sources said most MLAs checked out of   on Friday morning. “It’s up to them to decide where they want to go. Most of them have headed for New Delhi to lobby for ministerial posts,” a source said.
  
  
 Congress sources said after accommodating former ministers and senior leaders in the 22 berths allocated to the party, they will still be left with eight to 10 berths which will be given to senior members and youngsters.
 
 A senior   from south   who is also an aspirant for a berth said he would go back to his constituency. “I deserve a minister’s post but I have no godfather in New Delhi. The high command should look at merit and not go by caste and regional considerations,” he said.
