GURUGRAM: The state government could consider waiving stamp duty for builders on  , finance minister   has said.

 “We are continuously engaging with industry members to find out about their needs. The suggestion has come up at an industry discussion and we will definitely study its feasibility to see how it can be worked out on the ground,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a real estate convention in the city on Saturday.
 
 Being a state subject, stamp duty is fixed by the state government and varies between 4% and 12%. Affordable housing, which has been given infrastructure status in the Budget, is already exempt from service tax that is around 5.35% of a property’s selling price.
 
 The Minister’s response came in the wake of developers raising the issue during a panel discussion at the event, Invest Haryana. 
 
 Realtors said high stamp duty was an unsustainable component for them and urged the minister to waive off the same at least on affordable houses, which would give a major push to the sector.
 
 “At 5-6% of the cost, stamp duty is a huge amount for us, especially in case of   projects, and if the government can consider waiving that off, it would be a huge relief for developers as well as homebuyers,” said  , CMD of Signature Global.
 
 According to Ashwinder Singh, CEO (residential services) of JLL India, who was moderating the discussion, there is a requirement of 1.1 million units in affordable housing segment in the area. “And achieving these numbers would require some major push from the government,” he said.
 
 Developers also sought clarity from the government on whether affordable housing was to be considered by size, price or cost.
 
 Apart from the minister, the panel consisted of P  , additional chief secretary (finance and planning),  , chairman of M3M group, and Niranjan Hiranandani, co-founder and MD, Hiranandani Group.
