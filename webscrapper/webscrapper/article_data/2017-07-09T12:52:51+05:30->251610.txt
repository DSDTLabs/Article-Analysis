PUDUCHERRY/CHENNAI: DMK working president M K   urged the Union government to respect the governments elected democratically by the people in the States and Union territories and not to arbitrarily encroach upon the rights of the government spelled out clearly in the Constitution of India.

 Stalin also insisted the Union government to adhere to the recommendations of   with regard to the appointment of governors and lt governors. 
 
 “The act of running shadow governments from the Raj Bhavans in the states of West Bengal and New Delhi and   (Raj Nivas) is reprehensible and would deepen the fissures in the Centre-State relationship, which will in turn weaken the idea of Indian Union,” he said in a statement.

 Accusing Puducherry   Kiran Bedi for blatantly disregarding the democratically elected Congress government in Puducherry and acting in discordance with the tenets of the Constitution of India he said Bedi chose to be a ‘puppet’ in the hands of Union government.

He termed the nomination of three BJP functionaries as members of the legislative assembly willfully trampled upon the authority of the elected government granted by the Constitution.
 
  Coming down heavily on Bedi for swearing in newly-nominated MLAs in her office in shrouds of secrecy, especially when one of the nominated legislators has criminal cases foisted upon he said, “This very act, adds credence to the long standing allegation of Kiran Bedi being the ‘Mercenary Agent’ of the BJP central government, who spearheads the degraded ‘political manoeuvres’ for BJP in the state”.
