RANCHI: Schools in the state capital have begun counselling sessions for students appearing in various board examinations this year. The objective of such classes is to help students deal with examination stress. 

    Crime Records Bureau's (NCRB) latest report says 93 students committed suicide in the state after they failed their examinations in 2015. Of them, 63 were boys. 
 
  Earlier this week, a Class XII student of a private school set himself on fire on the school premises because of exam stress. The incident sent shock waves through the city and made schools start special counselling sessions. 
 
  CBSE city coordinator   said, "The incident was definitely shocking and schools are making an extra effort to counsel their students." 
 
  He added, "The CBSE has started counselling on toll free number 1800-118-004. The board has issued a circular directing all schools affiliated to it to organize counselling sessions." 
 
  Lal said his school has already started such a session where students are coming forward to discuss their problems. 
 
  He added, "Some students complain that their parents put excessive pressure on them for exceptional results. I would like to tell such parents notto compare their wards with other children. Instead, they should motivate them to do things they are good at." 
 
    also issued a toll free number for counselling. 
 
  "Students in distress can call up 1800-3456-523 between 10 am to 5 pm on any working day and share their problems. Our experts will help them get rid of pre-exam stress," council chairman Arvind Pratap said.
