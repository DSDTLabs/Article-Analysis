From his films to his relationships in  ,   opened up about a lot of things through his memoir  . The filmmaker said talking about all the things "opened up" his soul "even more".

 The memoir, which Karan co-wrote with  , created waves with its chapters describing his fallout with actress   and for candid talks about his sexual orientation.
 
  
  
 "Sometimes, opening about the minor or major details takes you back in time. Every time she (Poonam) made me describe my old bedroom, house, people and the relationships, I went back and analysed and spoke about so much that I probably I had kind of blushed over," Karan said. 
 
 "Things that I didn't want to address and look back at but I knew I wanted to because that's the whole idea of writing a memoir. I think I spoke about all those things and it kind of opened my soul up even more. Sometimes, talking helps, just conversing helps and that's what I realised when I spoke to Poonam," he added.
