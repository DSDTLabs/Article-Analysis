Tuticorin: Tense moments prevailed at the Sipcot industrial estate on the outskirts of the city here on Monday as more than 2,000 people, including 1,250 women, from 18 villages around the Sterlite copper plant thronged the industrial estate to petition the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and Sipcot officials seeking permanent closure of the plant. The villagers, including differently-abled, assembled at Madathur village near the plant and took out a procession to the industrial estate where the plant is located.  To ensure law and order, around 500 police personnel led by district SP P Mahendran were deployed at the industrial estate. Raising slogans against the plant, the protesters headed to the TNPCB office but the police blocked their way.  The protesters stopped but later agreed to send two representatives from each village to petition the officials. Representatives of Sterlite Ethirpu Anaithu Grama Makkal Kootamaipu (federation of all villagers against Sterlite) petitioned the district environmental engineer of TNPCB, T Kannan and pressed their demand.  The engineer told them that the case pertaining to Sterlite was pending before National Green Tribunal due to which he could not take any immediate action.  However, he promised to forward their petition to TNPCB officials and the government with reasons cited by the villagers. The villagers then petitioned Sipcot officials and left the place. Meanwhile, S P Muthuraman of Tirunelveli who had moved the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court against Sterlite, petitioned the district collector on Monday demanding that all industrial operations in Sipcot phase I in which close to 100 industries were functioning and phase II expansion works be stalled as they did not have the TNPCB certificate to establish and operate
