PANAJI: The nip in the air was sharper than usual on Friday morning, as the   plunged nearly 3C below normal to 17.6C — the lowest of the winter season so far. “This is the season’s lowest so far,” IMD scientist   said.

 The mercury had plunged to 17.6C on December 28, 2017, too. 
 
 However, according to the classification of the season, the two-month period of January and February is considered as the winter season in India, Sanap said.
 
 The mercury had been dropping and had reached 18 degree Celsius during the last week of December 2017 and again on New Year morning. A minimum   of 18 degree Celsius was again recorded after New Year, but it had not plunged any further.
 
 Mornings have been pleasant for the last couple of weeks, but the mercury occasionally rose suddenly. On Wednesday, the meteorological centre recorded a maximum temperature of 35.3 degree Celsius, nearly three degrees above normal. 
 
 “When dry air continues, the humidity in atmosphere is lower, and the temperature rises,” Sanap said.
 
 But on Friday, it was pleasant and the maximum temperature recorded was 33.6 degrees Celsius, just a degree above normal, which, again is in the normal range.
 
 Temperature fluctuations will continue with the IMD forecasting a minimum of around 19 degree Celsius and a maximum of 34 degrees Celsius for Saturday.
