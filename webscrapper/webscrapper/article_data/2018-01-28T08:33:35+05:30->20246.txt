PUNE: Keen to put the proposed Pune international airport at   on the fast track, chief minister   said the facility was unlikely to start operations in 2019, as stated earlier.

 With the   and assembly elections in 2019, he felt it would be “ambitious” to expect the operations to start within two years’ time with the clearance from the ministry of defence (MoD) only coming earlier this week. In a reply to a message from TOI after returning from  , the chief minister said the NOC (no objection certificate) from MoD had definitely cleared all the major hurdles for the proposed airport.
 
 “We will acquire land by direct purchase system,” he told TOI. The chief minister is positive that the clearance from MoD and the land acquisition process would set the airport ball rolling.
 
 
  
 
 Valsa Nair Singh, the principal secretary of civil aviation of the general administration department, said, “We were awaiting the clearance from MoD, which would speed up the project. Now, the district administration can act on the land acquisition procedures.”
 
 A high power committee under the chief minister is expected to review the entire process next week. It is expected to give the authorization to the Pune district collector to start the negotiation process with the villagers for the proposed airport and issue a notification exactly giving the details of land to be acquired from the seven villages — Pargaon, Ekalpur, Munjawadi, Kumbharvalan, Udachi Wadi, Vanpuri and Khanavadi.
 
 Once the notification specifying the boundaries of the airport is issued, a social impact assessment would be conducted through research organizations such as   or the economics department of University of Pune. Six to seven deputy collectors for the villages where the land would be acquired would help initiate dialogue and speed up the process, said an official.
