MUMBAI: The NCP said that Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s announcement that political parties will not be allowed to accept donations of more than Rs 2000 in cash from an individual donor had been brought in “reluctantly” following the directives of the   (EC). 

 Jaitley also said that parties would be entitled to receive donations by cheques or through the digital mode. In the Budget, an amendment is being proposed to facilitate issuing electoral bonds.
 
  Under the Representation of People’s Act provisions, it is mandatory for political parties to submit a written statement of donations of Rs 20,000 and more to the EC every year. 
 
 “In December 18, 2016, the EC had asked the NDA government to bring in changes in rules for donations to political parties to halt the flow of black money. Now, Jaitley has amended the rules, as such the credit goes to the election panel,” said NCP spokesperson  .
 
 City Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said disclosing all donations will be a big challenge for the BJP. “All along, the BJP was making attempts to delay information on donations. Check the EC’s records , it will be found that BJP never declared the statement of accounts within the stipulated period,” Nirupam said.
 
 However, the poll funding guidelines have elicited mixed reactions in the city. Former civic chief and convenor of the Action for Good Governance and Networking in India D M Sukhtankar said, “Cash donations have been reduced. Anything done to bring in transparency must be encouraged.” 
 
 Hansel D’Souza, founder president of the  , said the announcement was only half a reform. “While donations in cheque and other e-payments are being encouraged there is no system to track expenditure.” he said.
