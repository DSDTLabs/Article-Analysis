NEW DELHI: A   has observed that economic offences bring total imbalance in the national economy and refused to grant   to two   of a real estate firm who allegedly duped over 8,000 investors.

 Special Judge Kamini Lau also pulled up the   (EOW) of Delhi Police for clubbing all complaints together in one FIR and said it was an attempt by it to dilute the allegations against the accused. “This is a fit case where separate FIRs should have been registered by clubbing not more than three complaints in a particular year and not by clubbing all the complaints together in one FIR. There is an attempt on behalf of the investigating agency to dilute the allegations against the accused,” the court said.
 
 Avdhesh Kumar Goel and Atul Gupta, directors of Earth Infrastructure Limited, through their counsel, argued that the chargesheet has already been filed and no gainful purpose would be served by further incarcerating them in jail. Advocate Amit Kumar, appearing for the victim investors, opposed the bail plea saying there were chances that the accused would abscond.
