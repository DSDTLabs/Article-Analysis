NEW DELHI: Justice   is shocked at the dilution of his recommendations by the   members. "I am shocked to see that the BCCI has rejected all the major reforms again. The heart, kidney, lungs are being taken out if these reforms. It's a comprehensive report prepared by the committee and by removing the vital organs, nothing remains in the suggested reforms. I don't know what is happening," Justice Lodha told TOI on Wednesday.

 
 
 "What is the point in deliberating when the verdict is already given by the  ? I don't understand where is the possibility of changing the recommendations when all the review petitions have been rejected," he lamented.
 
 When asked about the road ahead, Lodha said the apex court will perhaps take a call very soon as the job of the   was only to prepare those recommendations for reforms and it has no power to implement them.
 
 "If the BCCI rejects reforms like the powers of the executives and the size of the apex council, it means BCCI is not interested in implementing the reforms at all. I am sure the honourable Supreme Court will take a look at it very soon," Lodha added.
