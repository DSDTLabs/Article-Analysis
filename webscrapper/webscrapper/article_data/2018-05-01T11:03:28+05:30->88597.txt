HYDERABAD:   president   said if voted to power, his organisation will order inquiries into allegations of corruption and commissions in projects such as Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya.

 
 He also warned the police not to simply follow the diktat of the ruling TRS and create hurdles for the TJS but follow the constitution and rules.
 
 Stating that TJS would bring in a people-centric governance, he said the TRS government’s ?4,000 per acre sop to farmers would not benefit all the farmers. “There are 15 lakh tenant farmers who will not get this sop. The crop loan waiver is not complete,” he said.
 
  appreciated the mohalla clinics-model being implemented by the Delhi government and said   too needs such a model suting the local needs.
 
 He said about 8,000 to 10,000 acres of land around Hyderabad would be enough to provide housing to the poor, house sites to the legal and journalist fraternities. What is required is willingness to do it which the   government lacks.
