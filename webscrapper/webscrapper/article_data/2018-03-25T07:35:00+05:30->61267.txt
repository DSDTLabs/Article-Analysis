Chandigarh: Punjab local bodies, tourism and cultural affairs minister Navjot Singh Sidhu courted another controversy on Saturday as Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders said he knew and leaked details of the budget before it was presented in the assembly.

 Former deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said Sidhu and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had committed a “criminal offence” by “leaking” the budget. SAD leaders demanded the chief minister to sack both ministers and said their party would introduce a privilege motion against the two ministers, apart from taking legal action.
 
 When contacted, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said it was wrong to say the budget was leaked. “A question on bus stand was listed before the budget and Sidhu said 14 new terminals were on the cards, but did not know if the (particular) town in question was on the list. But in reality 16 bus stands will be built,” he said.
 
 Sidhu has been facing attacks from SAD legislators, especially former finance minister Bikram Singh Majithia, in the ongoing assembly session. Both leaders have gotten into arguments inside the assembly and speaker Rana K P Singh had expunged their comments from recording in proceedings.
