AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has directed the   to provide police protection to the rape survivor nursing student of   and other witnesses.

 Justice P P Bhatt has ordered for “adequate police protection” of the rape survivor and other witnesses of the case while granting bail for three weeks to the 68-year-old rape accused,  , a trustee of the university and a suspended BJP member.
 
 The HC has ordered that the police commissioner will have to confirm that Patel or his relatives and friends do not make any attempt to tamper with evidence or influence any of the witnesses.
 
 Last week, the HC granted bail to Patel for three weeks to undergo a surgery called cholecystectomy at   at Chennai. Patel received temporary bail on depositing Rs 10 lakh before the jail authorities and furnishing two sureties of the same amount. If the court finds any violation of bail condition, the deposit of Rs 10 lakh will be forfeited.
 
 While releasing Patel on bail, the HC has directed him not to enter Gujarat during these three weeks. The court has also directed him not to use any mode of communication including electronic gadgets such as mobile phone, pager, laptop etc.
 
 Patel has been behind the bars since July 2016, after a 22-year-old nursing student of Parul University levelled rape charges against him. He had sought regular bail, but his counsel did not press the plea for regular bail after the HC directed the concerned trial court to expedite the trial against Patel.
 
 Patel asked for temporary bail for medical treatment at Chennai. The state government told the court that there was no need to grant bail because the surgery is possible at   in Ahmedabad. Patel’s advocate argued that the success ratio at the Chennai hospital is 85%. This led the HC to grant temporary bail to Patel by laying down strict conditions.
