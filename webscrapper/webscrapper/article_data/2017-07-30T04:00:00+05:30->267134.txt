Vadodara: A leopard was   by forest officials from a well in a village in the Kalol taluka of Panchmahal district on Saturday.

 According to sources, the leopard may have been chasing a prey when it fell into the well in Ved village sometime late on Friday night. Those who came to work on the farm where the well is located, spotted the leopard and informed forest department officials.
 
 The officials initially tried to make the leopard sit on a cot and bring it out, but were not successful. A series of cots were then tied to each other and lowered into the well. The leopard eventually climbed out of the well on these cots and left into the jungle.
