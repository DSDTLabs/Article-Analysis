BENGALURU: For nine years,   suffered from   accompanied by  . Frequent visits to hospitals didn't help. Neither did cough syrups. In fact, her condition deteriorated over the years as the Koppal girl found it difficult to breathe.

 Renuka, 19, finally got relief on Tuesday, when doctors removed a pen's blind cap (the detachable end) from her lung. The surgery was conducted at the government run   (RGICD). The teenager had swallowed the object as a class 3 student while playing a prank.
 
 A team of thoracic surgeons and an anaesthetist headed by Dr Shashidhar Buggi, director of RGICD, found the three-cm cap lodged in the lower lobe of her left lung. The lobe had shrunk over the years, leading to breathing trouble.
 
 “The chronic cough annd foul-smelling sputum were signs of infection in the lungs, leading to organ damage. The foreign object was radiolucent -it couldn't be seen on an X-ray film and was only visible as a dark spot. We tried to remove it via endoscopy but it wasn't possible.Hence we had to operate on the patient. Before the surgery , we had to improve her general condition to avoid post-operative complications,“ said Dr Buggi.
 
 Renuka's parents, both labourers in Koppal, were worried about her deteriorating health as no doctor in the re gion could identify the problem. “It was only at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences(KIMS), Hubballi, that we got to know about the cap.Renuka told doctors about having swallowed it by mistake long ago. They asked us to consult RGICD doctors,“ said Renuka's uncle Yellanagowda Mali Patil.
 
 Renuka, a nursing student in Hubballi, is recovering and will have to stay in hospital for some more time.Such cases are often mistaken for tuberculosis as chronic cough is a symptom of TB too, said Dr Buggi. “Only thorough methodical analysis can help practioners solve such a problem. Renuka visited many hospitals in the past nine years but was only given symptomatic treatment to reduce the cough,“ he added.
