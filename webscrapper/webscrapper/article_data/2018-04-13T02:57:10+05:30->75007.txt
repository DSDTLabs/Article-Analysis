NEW DELHI: In an "unprecedented move", the   proctor's office sent a warning letter to two students for writing 'Suspend Johri' on the campus road during a protest on March 27, demanding the ouster of professor  , accused of sexually harassing eight of his students. 

  Students said the warning letter was a first of its kind in JNU, a university where graffiti, posters and banners are "part of the culture". This letter was an indication that the administration was shielding Johri, the students said. 
 
  In the letter sent to Srabani Chakraborty and  , the administration said that their action "is unbecoming of a JNU student". JNUSU president   alleged that the administration is "trying to save Johri and one of its steps is to stop students raising questions about him." 
 
  Members of the Student Faculty Committee of School of Life Sciences in a statement said that they were "disappointed by the outcome of the meeting with the administration on April 9" and feel that the administration was not doing anything in the matter.
