 Superintendent of Gonda police Sudhir Kumar Singh said the social media groups were being run without pre-certifications but were being used for campaigning actively. In October 2013, just before Lok Sabha elections, Election Commission had set up dos and don'ts for candidates. According to guidelines at the time of nomination, candidates need to provide details of social media accounts used by them before the poll panel. Candidates were also asked to state whether they were paying money to a company or individual to run the accounts while submitting the statement of expenditure. On coming across the anomaly, Gonda district magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan, who has served as director of state's information department in the past decided to initiate action against 15 candidates, including sitting MLAs Bavan Singh (BJP candidate from Katra) and Yogesh Pratap Singh (SP candidate from Colonelganj) and 13 other candidates from different political parties. 
 
 The candidates have been directed to submit their applications before media certification and monitoring committees (MCMC) a district body, to begin campaigning on social media.
