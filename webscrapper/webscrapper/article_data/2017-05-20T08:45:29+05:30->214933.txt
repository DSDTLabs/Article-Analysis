BHOPAL: Justice S K Pandey, who is heading the   investigating the   undertrials’ jail break and death will visit Bhopal central jail to ascertain the feasibility of an escape attempt from the walled premises and barracks.

 Sources at the jail headquarters told TOI that Justice Pandey could inspect the prison in the first week of June. “We are yet to get the exact date of the visit,” said an officer in the department.
 
 He said the commission may consider reconstruction of the sequence of events that led to the escape from the barracks and how they scaled the wall. The commission might cross-examine witnesses, said the officer.
 
 Justice Pandey is said to be on leave till May 26. “We expect his visit between June 1 and 7,” said another officer.
 
 Recently, the commission had dismissed a petition filed by representatives of the slain undertrials for cross-examination of all documents submitted by police and the jails department. They, however, shared copies of 25 documents they had asked for in a separate application.
 
 Sources said the police and jails department have submitted a lot of documents related to the case, running into 6,000-odd pages. Most of the documents have been categorised as ‘classified’ since the case is being investigated by CID, said a police officer.
 
 Applicants are being allowed to inspect the documents as and when required, said sources. The commission has reportedly cited Section 8 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, while dismissing their application for cross-examination of evidence. It says the commission has the power to regulate its own procedure.
 
 The judicial commission was constituted by the state government seven days after the   and alleged encounter.
