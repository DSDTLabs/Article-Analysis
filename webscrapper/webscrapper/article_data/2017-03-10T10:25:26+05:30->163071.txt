PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s property   would undertake a   recovery drive from March 11.

 Under the drive, dues from big defaulters will be recovered on priority basis. Properties of those not paying the arrears would be seized.
 
 Dilip Gawde, joint commissioner and head of   department,   (PCMC) told TOI this was a part of a special drive to recover 100% property tax from property holders.
 
 Gawde said the total property tax arrears was around Rs 300 crore. He said the state urban development department, through a government resolution on March 1, had stated if the collection of property tax and recovery of its arrears was effective then it would increase the financial capacity of municipal corporations. This would help them to provide basic amenities to citizens. It also directed the municipal corporations to conduct special drives for 100% collection of property tax from March 1 to 31. 
 
 The property tax collection up to March 8 in the 2016-17 fiscal was Rs 342.06 crore.
 
 Reminders will be sent to all the defaulters who have arrears as on March 10 directing them to clear the dues. Pre-property seizure notices are being sent to all defaulters having arrears over Rs 10,000. The divisional offices of the civic property tax department would remain open on all days, including holidays, up to March 31 from 9am to 4pm as part of the drive. Property holders can also pay the tax online on the civic body’s website www.pcmcindia.gov.in.
