Kanyakumari: The 12-year-old boy through whom the sexual abuse incidents came to light had lost both his parents. Hailing from Panagudi in neighbouring Tirunelveli district, the boy and his elder brother, an eighth standard student, are staying in the same Adi Dravida Welfare hostel at Kuzhithurai. “They have a sister who is staying with their guardian in Nagercoil. Following the sexual abuse and hospitalisation of the boy, his guardian was informed about the incident. They visited him but refused to take him along though we explained that he needs a change of place to recover,” said DCPO S Kumuda.
