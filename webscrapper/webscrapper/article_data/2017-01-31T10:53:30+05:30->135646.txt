GUWAHATI: The   (GACDC) on Monday announced an   from February 20, seeking inclusion of the names of all   of the state in the   (NRC), which is being updated across Assam. 

 GACDC chairman   said the Gorkhas, with a population of around 30 lakh, are the original inhabitants of Assam. Thus, a member of the community with roots in the state can not be left out from the NRC. "If names of people from Bodo and Rabha communities can be included in the NRC under 'original inhabitants' column even without requisite documents, why the Gorkhas need all the documents? Gorkhas are the original inhabitants of Assam who contributed to the nation building process. We can not be deprived like immigrants," said Chetry, who will begin the fast supported by activists of the leading organization of the Gorkhas.
 
 The council said the cutoff date for detection and deportation of illegal immigrants as per the Assam Accord should not be applicable in the case of Gorkhas.
