Coimbatore: A 13-year-old boy was electrocuted after he came into contact with live wires while trying to enter a farmland at Iluppanatham village near Sirumugai on the outskirts of the city on Sunday morning.

 Police said the farmowner had installed a solar fencing around the farm spread across eight acres to save crops from wild boars. “The farmer connected the live wire to the fence illegally and it claimed the minor boy’s life,” they said.
 
 The deceased was identified as P Hari Prakash, 13, of Naanal Pallathottam at Iluppanatham village near Sirumugai. He was Class IX student of the government higher secondary school at S Pungampalayam.
 
 The farmland belongs to S Veerapathiran, 53 of Paraiyur near Sirumugai. The preliminary investigation revealed that he often used to connect live wire to the solar fence at night and disconnect it in the day. “On Sunday, he forgot to disconnect the live wire. The minor boy, who resided near the farm land, touched the fence and died on the spot,” the police said.
 
 When the boy didn’t return home, his father Palanisamy launched a search and found his son dead near the solar fence. As the news spread, local residents alerted the Sirumugai police who sent the body to the government hospital in Mettupalayam for postmortem
 
 Meanwhile, Iluppanatham villagers staged a road roko and demanded action against the farm owner. They also requested the Tangedco to disconnect the power supply to the farm.
 
 The police, however, pacified the villagers and assured them to take appropriate action. They have registered a case against Veerapathiran, who is on the run after the incident. Further investigation is on.
