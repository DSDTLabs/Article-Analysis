SURAT: Amid nationwide outrage over the gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old in Kathua, Surat police told TOI on Sunday that an 11-year-old, whose body was found about 10 days ago, had been raped, tortured and strangled to death. There were at least 86 injury marks on her body.

 
 There were severe injuries to the girl’s private parts caused by a blunt object, according to the autopsy report. It seems she was confined, raped and brutally tortured before being killed, cops said.
 
 Police are yet to make any headway on the girl’s identity or the perpetrators of the ghastly crime.
 
  
  
 
 The Surat police on Sunday formed several teams to trace the identity of a girl whose body was dumped after she was raped, torured and killed, and to track down the perpetrators of the crime, following widespread protests by people against “police inaction”. 
 
 The girl’s body was found under the bushes near a cricket stadium in Pandesara area of Surat on April 6 morning, “We will widen our probe to trace the perpetrators of the crime. All residential colonies and societies near the crime spot would be checked again to get clues. We will scan CCTV footages of nearby places,” Surat Police Commissioner Satish Sharma told TOI.
