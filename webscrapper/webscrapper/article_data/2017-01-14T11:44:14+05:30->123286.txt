BHOPAL:   — a   — appeared before a special court in Gwalior on Friday. He stated that many more mysterious deaths have taken place during the course of investigations.

 Chaturvedi said that neither the CBI nor police were ready to take his information on record. He also appraised the court with some security issues.
 
 Chaturvedi had appeared in connection with a case related to Rahul Yadav, a key accused. Rahul was admitted to Gwalior Medical College despite the fact that he had flunked in Class 12 board exams. He is the brother of Deepak Yadav, another key accused in the Vyapam scam.
 
 “Madhya Pradesh police has conducted a parallel investigation in the 40 Vyapam-related deaths before the case was handed over to the CBI, and they have given a clean chit in all of them. CBI is going on the same line,” said Chaturvedi.
 
 Earlier, the same court had issued an arrest warrant against Chaturvedi for his non-appearance despite repeated summons for statements in the case. Chaturvedi claimed that the local police had been misleading him as well as the court.
 
 During one of the previous hearings, Chaturvedi had termed the trial taking place in the court of a special judge for Vyapam in Gwalior as ‘illegal’ stating that Gwalior SIT was perusing the case despite all Vyapam related cases being transferred to the CBI.
