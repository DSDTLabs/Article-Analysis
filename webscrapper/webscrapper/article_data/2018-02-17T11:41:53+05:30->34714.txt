SURAT: It seems the garden department officials of   (SMC) and elected representatives need to wake up from their slumber.

 In a classic example, the volunteers of   ( ) had acted fast when they spotted fire in plantation and bushes along the   walkway. Despite repeated calls to the garden in-charge and other staff, nobody could find the cause of fire or catch the culprit responsible for setting the fire. 
 
 “At least 35 species of birds, reptiles and small animals like mongoose have been nesting on the trees and in the burrows near the Chowpaty walkway on the Ahtwalines riverfront. These species get disturbed due to such fire incidents. Hence, we were quick to respond when we got the message,” a volunteer of NCS said. He added, “After two days of keeping a watch along the walkway, we found a man identified as   who had caused the fire. We caught him and asked about the reason for the fire and found that he was drunk. He was working in a nearby temple.”
 
 According to NCS volunteers, the fire has damaged underground water pipeline laid by the garden department. 
 
 In-charge of Chowpaty garden   has assured that such mischievous elements damaging public property and destroying the eco-system will be dealt with strict action.
