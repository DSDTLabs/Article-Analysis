SRINAGAR: The growing trend of locals disrupting counter-insurgency operations and providing cover to terrorists during encounters is causing alarm among the Indian security establishment in the Kashmir valley.

 On Tuesday, a Pakistani terrorist of   managed to escape in a similar circumstance even though another one was killed during a gunfight at Hajjin in   causing heavy causalities to the army.
 
 Three soldiers and a major were killed in the encounter. “Terrorist sympathizers came out with lathis, rods and threw stones on the security forces. It is really a matter of concern,” an intelligence officer said.
 
 Similar tactics were employed at   in Frisal in south Kashmir on Sunday when residents attacked counter-insurgents so that the terrorists could escape from the hideout.
 
 A senior intelligence officer said, youth have been feeling encouraged to disrupt anti-terror operations since the killing of   terrorsit   in July last year.
 
 “Despite declaring curfew in the entire valley, the state administration at the time allowed Wani’s funeral procession.
 
 This also emboldened separatist leaders to spearhead the five month long agitation,” the officer said.
 
 The army and various counter-insurgency groups met in December last to chalk out a plan to deal with this problem but it was not allowed to be implemented because of political reasons, an intelligence officer said.
 
 Intelligence sources said security forces have been instructed to withdraw from such situations to avoid civilian causalities. “Our forces exercise restraint when civilians attack them in counterinsurgency operations,” an officer said.
 
 According to sources, there are over 200 active terrorists in the valley -- 66 local and 44 foreign terrorists in north Kashmir and 109 locals and seven foreign terrorists in south Kashmir.
