NAVI MUMBAI:  's failure to complete a 3.5 guntha land acquisition way back since 1990 has held up the NH-4B highway widening work between   and D Point. This patch of land falls between the NH-4B and Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) land. 

 The land is owned by a single person but his expanded families are not happy with the alternate land being offered by Cidco. The owner's family has expanded to five families. The land owners had also dragged Cidco to court over the land offered by the town planning body.
 
 One of the affected family members   complained, "Cidco had promised to hand over 150 sq m land to us at Karanjade but we objected to it as the land was not enough to accommodate five families. Later they offered two plots but failed to do so. We have taken Cidco to the Bombay high court. Cidco failed to produce plot allotment papers even a year and a half after the HC's order."
 
  Patil added that the NH-4B work has been held up though they are ready to vacate the area. "Living here, we are facing the highway widening work related vibration and pollution problem. Ours is the only house falling between the NH-4B and NMIA area. Cidco has to produce the exact plots to HC in the next court hearing."
 
 Another family head Dipak Patil alleged that Cidco has not given them the 12.5% land against their farm land acquired for the airport. "Despite the court order the Cidco is unable to hand over the Karanjade plots to us," he said.
 
 A NHAI executive engineer said, "The issue of land handover is between Cidco and the land owners. As Cidco has not handed over the land to NHAI the NH-4B widening work is held up at the plot in   between Kalamboli and D Point." 
 
 The 11km long NH-4B widening work is being undertaken between Kalamboli and Palaspe through the D-point near Chinchpada village at a cost of Rs414 cr ore . 
 
 Cidco PRO Mohan Ninawe said, "The details of the land handover issue will be checked with our concerned department."
