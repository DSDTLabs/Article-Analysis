THANE: While the relentless drive against encroachments in the city has drawn the ire of the political class, it has garnered a huge   from resident activists. 

 A group of   from   road has started an online petition in support of civic chief Sanjeev Jaiswal encouraging him to continue with his ‘good’ work ever since he took up charge as the commissioner of Thane city. 
 
 Citizen activists from the Residents’ Association for Areas around Gladys Alvares Marg (RAGA) said that Jaiswal has dared to do some good work for the benefit of the city and it is payback time for them by extending their support.
 
 “There have been allegations of the civic chief misusing civic machinery by politicians expressing their ire against the stern action on hawkers and auto drivers since last week. Instead, we owe it to Jaiswal for what he has done. We have started an online campaign https://www.change.org/p/ragathane-let-s-join-citizens-campaign-launched-by-raga-in-support-of-tmc-chief-sanjeev-jaiswal where residents can sign and extend their support,” said  , member of RAGA.
 
 Another group of residents is working on ensuring that hawkers don’t return after the civic drives are over by inviting farmers straight into the society premises. 
 
 “We are working towards bringing farm produce right into the society premises so that residents don’t have to venture far in case the local marts aren’t located nearby and in turn don’t encourage proliferation of hawkers,” said Kasber Augustine, a citizen activist from Vartak Nagar, who also recommends a need to demarcate zones for the street vendors.
