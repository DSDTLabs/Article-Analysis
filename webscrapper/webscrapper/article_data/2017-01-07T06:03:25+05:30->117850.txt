NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Friday decided to increase pensions to senior citizens, widows and people with disability by Rs 1,000 per month. It was decided to enhance the family income limit to Rs 1 lakh per annum from Rs 60,000 under the old-age   scheme and Rs 75,000 per annum under the disabili ty pension scheme.

 Deputy chief minister   said the move was necessitated by rising inflation. As the decision comes just a few months before the municipal elections, it's likely to give the opposition ammunition to target the government.
 
 Senior citizens in the age group of 60-69 years will get Rs 2,000 as pension now against Rs 1,000, while those above 70 years will get Rs 2,500 compared to Rs 1,500 earlier. Disability pension has been raised from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500 while pension for widows and destitute women has been raised from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500 per month.
 
 A cabinet meeting, chaired by   Arvind Kerjiwal, also approved changes to the eligibility criteria. The income criteria will apply to only the new beneficiaries.
 
 It is expected that approximately 1 lakh new applications will be received under old-age pension scheme within a month, for whom pension will be due from February 2017. An additional expenditure of Rs 154 crore is expected to be incurred on 5 lakh old-age pension beneficiaries for the remaining four months of 2016-17.
 
 Hence, the revised budget estimate under old-age pension would be Rs 765 crore. For the same rate of assistance, budget requirement for 2017-18 will be Rs 1,431 crore for 5.30 lakh beneficiaries, which is the upper limit in number of beneficiaries allowed in the scheme.
 
 “The last enhancement in the quantum of assistance by way of pension was done many years ago, whereas the cost of living has increased substantially in the intervening period,“ said a press statement released by the Delhi government. “Increasing food prices, difficulty to access medical care in government hospitals and prohibitively expensive private medical care and other items of personal needs necessary for the care of senior citizens and disabled persons are a severe drain on the family resources,“ it said.
