 Three former circle officers — Shiv Ranjan, Madan Kumar and Kumar Kundan Lal, former circle inspector Anuj Kumar and three former revenue employees Suresh Prasad, Chandrika Prasad and Manoj Kumar have also been made accused for ploting and helping the land grab. 
 
 According to complainant Ram Narayan Prasad, the plot was gifted to him by his maternal uncle Bipat Ram in 1948 as the latter did not have any issue. 
 
 The complainant’s grandson, Vikas Kumar, told TOI over the phone on Thursday that his grandfather had hired a man to do farming on the plot. He instead connived with officials and sold the plot by forging documents. 
 
 “According to the records of revenue office, part of the plot was also purchased by Giriraj,” he said.
 
 Vikas said his family was constantly being threatened to withdraw the case. “We fear worse as we belong to a scheduled caste,” he added.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said City SP (west) Ravindra Kumar would supervise the case. Kumar said investigations were on.
