NEW DELHI: Even as there are protests over shrinking research programmes in   after the 2016 UGC notification, many students already pursuing MPhil and PhD courses say they haven’t received their fellowship money since January. The students’ union has called it “vendetta politics”. 

 Farhat Salim, an MPhil student, says that he applied for fellowship in January. “Usually it takes around 10 to 15 days for the money to come. But we haven’t received it yet,” he said, adding that he hadn’t paid his mess dues and the debt burden was becoming heavier by the day. 
 
 JNUSU alleged in a statement, “UGC has stopped fellowship for JNU students due to its vendetta attitude towards JNU.   students are in the last months of writing their dissertations and theses and many have to leave for field work.” 
 
 JNUSU also claimed that the finance officer gave technical reasons for the delay and that they had written to the VC, seeking his intervention.
 
 UGC and JNU authorities couldn’t be reached for a reaction despite several attempts. 
 
 A Jamia student, however, said that the problem seemed to be specific to JNU only. “Unlike JNU, most of us are receiving stipends regularly,” said MPhil student Arshi Chauhan.
