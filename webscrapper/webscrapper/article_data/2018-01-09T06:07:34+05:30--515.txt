CHIKKAMAGALURU: A 20-year-old college student allegedly hanged herself here this weekend after she was harassed for her inter-faith friendship with a man. Five people were booked for abetment to suicide on Monday, and one of them, the town's   vice-president, Anil, arrested. 

 The trouble began when   posted a photo with a friend from another community on  . The photo began to be circulated on social media, including WhatsApp, where some users are said to have disparaged the friendship.
 
 On Saturday, the accused, irked by their friendship, barged into Dhanyashree's home and threatened her mother that they would go to "extremes" if the relationship was not ended, sources said. They also showed copies of the FB photo to her mother.
 
  Hours later, around 10pm, Dhanyashree hanged herself, leaving behind a suicide note. Police haven't disclosed the contents of the note. 
 
  Police are also exploring options to crack down on netizens responsible for Dhanyashree's death. "We're probing (how) to bring to book others who circulated the girl's picture on WhatsApp. This could have driven her to suicide," Chikkamagaluru SP   said. 
 
 Sources said it was a clear case of moral policing.
