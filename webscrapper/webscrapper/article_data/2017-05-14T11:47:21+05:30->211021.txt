LUCKNOW: The six-month treatment of the pain after a   and the problem it caused in eating would take only a day to heal when King George’s Medical University’s dental faculty replaces the two-stage process with Italian   WeldOne from June. The technique, developed by Dr Marco Degidi was showcased by Delhi-based Dr   to KGMU's dental faculty as well as of the private dental colleges of the city at a workshop on Saturday. The technique is being used widely in Delhi and   has already started the process to procure the equipment and begin training.

 Going the   way, patients will not just be relieved of the pain and surgery within a day, the cost of surgery will also be the same. “The conventional method calls for two surgeries and after the first, patient cannot eat solid food besides putting mouth to other uses including smiling,” said Dr Kamleshwar Singh, from KGMU's prosthodontics department who was the organising secretary. “The second surgery is done after three to four months once the former implant has stabilised but the Italian technique will allow implantation of the entire structure in a day using titanium wire welding,” he added. 
 
 KGMU's dental department treats around 60 patients of dental implants in a month. “If we undertake a full-mouth implant involving 4-5 teeth in each of lower and upper jaw, the cost is around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000. The new technique will also cost around the same and also save time and effort,” he added.
