Nagpur: Nagpur Improvement Trust’s (NIT) anti-encroachment squad, which had started demolition of an illegal e-cab charging centre at Gokul Society on Gorewada Road on Friday, stopped the work abruptly on Saturday. The squad only demolished the entry gate of the centre.  The work stopped after Vijendra Bharti, assistant manager of a private cab aggregator, submitted a written assurance to NIT that they would themselves remove the illegal construction within seven days, said division officer (west) Pankaj Ambhorkar.  He added that NIT would resume the drive on July 17 if they failed to remove the illegal construction. SNDL — a private power distribution franchise — had disconnected the centre’s power supply after NIT’s request.  “This centre for charging and maintenance of almost 20 e-cabs was constructed without valid permission,” said SS Bagchi, a resident of the society. Around 150 residents from the Society had lodged a complaint with NIT over illegal construction of the centre. “The 150 Kilo watts transformer for e-cab charging centre was erected along the road. It is a threat to children playing in the vicinity,” said another resident Hitesh Agrawal.  The only narrow entry and exit lane into the society is also used by e-cabs. It has led to traffic congestion in the residential area, he added. The residents are also opposing the construction of a shed for cabs at the site. “We do not want this construction to happen It is illegal to conduct any commercial activity in a residential area,” Bagchi said. in May this year, NIT had served a notice to the centre’s owner and asked to submit all documents within a month.  The NIT anti-encroachment squad, led by Ambhorkar, reached the spot with an excavator after the centre failed to submit the documents.
