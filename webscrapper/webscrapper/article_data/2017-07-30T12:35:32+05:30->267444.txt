AURANGABAD: The Employees   Scheme (EPS-95), 1995 members demanded a minimum Rs 7,500 pension under the scheme to the retired staff of private and other sectors. Currently EPS-95 provides a minimum monthly pension of Rs 1,000. Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had started providing this entitlement under the scheme from September 1, 2014.

 Subhash Deokar, district unit general secretary of the EPS-95   national coordination committee, said that many such pensioners who have retired from state road transport corporation, electricity department, sugar factories, cooperative banks, newspapers and factories get a meagre Rs 1,000 as pension. “Most of them get less than Rs 2,500 monthly pension which was not enough to meet their daily needs,” he said.
 
 He said Union labour minister   is scheduled to visit Shirdi on August 12 and 13 to attend a conference and we are planning to make a representation to the minister drawing his attention towards the sorry state of affairs involving the pensioners.
 
 He pointed out that there were 55 lakh such pensioners across the country and around 55,000 of them lived in Marathwada. A meeting of these pensioners has been convened in the city on Sunday to discuss about making a representation to the minister. Mostly, our demand involves Rs 7,500 minimum pension, inclusion of fresh staffers particularly those who were not part of the scheme, and free medical services to the pensioner and spouse along with a   to them.
