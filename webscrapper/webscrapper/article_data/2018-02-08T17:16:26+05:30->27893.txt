With an intention to teach management students how to use art therapy and expressive therapy,   organized a   titled ‘Impact of art on social care’ last week. The workshop was conducted by Gayathri Ganapathy, founder and art director for a social initiative that serves for dance arts mental health well being and research in Manchester.
 
 “There are a lot of people who are doing expressive art therapy but it is about the knowledge base. The practical experience that was shared was the best part about the workshop,” says Gayathri. The workshop even explained to students how, while being dancer or musician, one can use that art form and look at it in a therapeutic way and the benefits it has to offer.
