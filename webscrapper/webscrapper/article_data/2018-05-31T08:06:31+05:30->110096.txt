 and Saif Ali Khan’s son   is one of the biggest talking point in the   industry. The little munchkin seems to be every paparazzi’s favourite and no matter wherever he is headed, he is surrounded by shutterbugs. In the mere age of 17 months, the little baby boy becomes viral almost everyday owing to his cuteness and popularity.

 
 However, in an interview with a magazine, Kareena revealed that she and her husband   do not like the media attention on son Taimur. Kareena said that as parents they’re scared and want their son to grow up as normally as possible. In fact, Bebo revealed that Saif’s more particular about this and wants Taimur to grow up away from the eye of the paparazzi and the film scenario.
 
 
 The media often thinks that Taimur enjoys the attention and the camera flashes, but Kareena confessed that he doesn’t really. In fact, the little one wonders as to what they’re doing and why they’re calling out his name. Kareena went on to add that like every protective mother she doesn’t want Taimur to get this kind of attention as he is quite bright and aware as a child.
