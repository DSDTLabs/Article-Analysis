Mettur: Two contract labourers have suffered burn injuries in a cylinder blast at the Mettur Thermal Power Plant in Salem district on Monday. The victims have been identified as A Jaganathan, 35, and P Anandhan, 36, of Andikkarai near Mettur.

 On Monday morning, Jaganathan was doing wielding work near the boiler unit. Since the oxygen in the cylinder he used for the operations exhausted, he went to godown to bring a new cylinder. While carrying the cylinder, it slipped from his hands, fell on the floor and exploded. Coworkers rushed them to the Mettur government hospital.
 
 Mettur police said that Jaganathanâ€™s arm got cut and fell about 10ft away from the spot. They added, Anandhan might have lost his hearing due to blast impact, but were not sure whether it was permanent.tnn
