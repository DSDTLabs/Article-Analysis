PARIS: Half-man, half-beast, the tall African statues dominate a gallery in Paris’ Quai Branly museum. But few visitors are aware they are looking at what might be considered stolen goods.

 
 The three imposing wooden carvings were plundered by French troops in 1892 from the kingdom of   — modern-day  .
 
 From London to Berlin, Europe’s museums are packed with hundreds of thousands of colonial-era items. Increasingly, they are facing the question of whether they should be there at all. But in  , a speech by French President Emmanuel   has spurred hope that things may change. “Africa’s heritage cannot just be in European private collections and museums,” Macron said in Burkina Faso in November. He charged two experts with working out how to give African artefacts back within five years.
 
 French art historian Benedicte Savoy, one of the experts appointed by Macron along with Senegalese writer Felwine Sarr, described her job as “a hell of a challenge”.
 
 Museums have wrestled with legal and ethical problems concerning who really “owns” such objects.
 
 European conservationists have raised concerns, worrying artefacts could be stolen or handled improperly if given to inexperienced museums in politically unstable countries. African officials say these treasures should be at home, attracting tourists and boosting national pride.
 
 For Crusoe Osagie, spokesman for the governor of Nigeria’s Edo State, it is wrong that his children must go to Britain or Germany to see their heritage in glass cabinets. “These objects belong to us and were forcefully denied to our possession,” he said. German museums have taken the lead. At Berlin’s Humboldt Forum, labels are set to include details of how colonial-era items came to be in the collection.
