KOCHI: The high court has ordered stringent action against the common practice of dispensing medicines from medical shops by unqualified persons. Only a qualified pharmacist can dispense medicines and severe action should be taken against the medical shops that violate the law, the court said. 

 The order was issued by a single bench of the high court after considering a petition filed by Premji M P, secretary of the   of Cholavayal in Kalpetta. It was alleged by the petitioner that medical shops are employing persons not qualified as pharmacists for dispensing medicines and such a practice violates provisions of Pharmacy Act of 1948, Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, Pharmacy Practice Regulations 2015, etc.
