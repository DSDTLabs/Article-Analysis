KOLHAPUR: The citizens may face water cuts for an indefinite period as the water resources department (WRD) has threatened to shut down the pumping stations if the   (KMC) fails to pay the annual dues of over Rs 5 crore.

 The KMC lifts water from several sources including Bhogavati and Panchganga. The WRD — that comes under the state government — charges the civic body and other local governing bodies for using the water from these sources.
 
 The KMC lifts an average 120 million litre of water every day at around Rs 4.20 for every 10,000 litre. After lifting water from   at Shinganapur and  , the KMC supplies it to water treatment plants from where it is supplied to the households.
 
 A senior WRD official, requesting anonymity, said, “We had issued a notice regarding the payment of dues on January 23 and asked the civic authorities to pay the money before January 30. However, the KMC has not yet responded to the notice. The total amount of pending dues is Rs 17 crore since the last 10 to 15 years. We have now issued a final notice and if the civic administration fails to respond we will stop the pumping stations and the KMC will be responsible for the citizen’s anger.”
 
 The civic authorities, however, claim the WRD has used wrongly calculated the dues. The officials claim the rate of Rs 4.20 per 10,000 litre is not applicable for the civic body as the service is provided in the larger interest of the public.
 
 “As per the rules, the department should have been charged 70 paise per 10,000 litre. The KMC has paid annual fees as per the rate applicable for the local bodies. Water supply is public service and the KMC does not think of it as a revenue earning source. The rate considered by the WRD is not affordable,” said  , hydraulic engineer of the KMC.
 
 The KMC has drafted a long letter to reply the WRD’s notice. The letter will be sent to the WRD once civic chief P Siva Sankar signs on it.
