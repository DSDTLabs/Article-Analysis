THANE: A casual stroll in Sanjay Gandhi National Park turned scary for a group of eight teenagers and an adult, as they   their way in the forest range on Monday. The group was trapped in the hills for almost seven hours before officials from the Balkum fire brigade and the district’s disaster management unit reached there and got them back.

 The nine have been identified as Arjun Ghosh (15), Shruti Sarnagal (14),   (15), Om Keshkamat (15), Akshit Mahor (16),   (16),   (16), Jorden Sons (16), Tarak Modi (48). All are residents of Neelkanth Woods in  .
 
  On monday morning, after spending time at   near Tiku-ji-ni-wadi, the group decided to explore the forest by themselves. They embarked on a trek towards the forest ranges around 7.30am. In an attempt to try the unbeaten road, the group ditched the pathway and started walking inside the forest area. Soon, they realised they had lost their way.
 
 “The nine continued to walk aimlessly till noon, shouting for help. When some locals spotted them, they immediately alerted the fire brigade. Around 2pm, we received a call about these lost teenagers. A rescue team was dispatched and we located all of them and brought them back,” said Santosh Kadam, officer-in-charge of the disaster management unit.
