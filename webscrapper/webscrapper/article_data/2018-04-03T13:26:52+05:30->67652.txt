We had a late crop this year with poor rainfall in November and December (last year). Raging winds and rainfall on Sunday night has totally damaged the crop and we are now in a hopeless situation,” said Chengali Ratna Reddy, a farmer from   in   rural mandal.
 
 Farmers said they have invested huge sums on crop this year and rains have damaged almost 30 per cent of the total crop. “Sooty mould and other fungal infections are rampant this year. We had invested huge sums on protecting the flowers and fruits. We are about to harvest crop within a couple of weeks and untimely rains have adversely affected crops. There is no chance for us to evade loses this year,” said Akkineni Ram Prasad, a farmer from Nuzvid. K Ajay Babu, assistant director of horticulture, said they noticed 15 to 20% drop in mango cultivation. Further, banana crop was damaged in around 159 acres of Bapulapadu and Musunuru mandal with the sudden rains.
