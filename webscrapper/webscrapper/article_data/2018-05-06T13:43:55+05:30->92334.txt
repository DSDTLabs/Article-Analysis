If speculations are anything to go by, director  , who is currently riding high on the success of his last release, ‘Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety’ may cast   and   for his next. As per reports on a website, while there’s no official confirmation, Ajay is a part of the first draft of the movie, which will be a quirky comedy. However, the two actors are yet to meet and discuss more on the idea. That sounds like an interesting combo now, doesn’t it?

 However, it is only once the actors confirm that the movie will move to the next stage. Recently, the director had confirmed that while nothing is certain as of now, he has met Ranbir for a narration and discussed a few ideas but there’s been no concrete move on this yet. The director plans on taking a break for the next 19 months before his next release and has no insecurities about losing the audience’s attention. He revealed that even before ‘Sonu…’, there were times when he was not directing the movie but only scripting and preparing for it. Who will the leading lady be? We wonder…
