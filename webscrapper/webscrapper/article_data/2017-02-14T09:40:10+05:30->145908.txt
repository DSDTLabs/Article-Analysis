BENGALURU: If you happen to zip through   on Valentine’s Day, you’ll see trees sporting messages on love for the environment and conservation. In a last-ditch attempt to save the 112 trees facing the axe, activists and volunteers have decided to paint them to drive home the point.

  has marked the trees for felling, in order to widen Jayamahal Road. The widening is being taken up to build the down ramp for the proposed steel flyover. 
 
 “The authorities will only wait till February 17 for objections to the tree removal. By that time, we want to garner as much support as possible to save the trees. We want more people to join us on Valentine’s Day to paint the trees,” said Pranay Jajodia, a volunteer.
 
 The tree painting is a joint initiative of   India and   foundation. The event will start near the Fun World side of Jayamahal Road and will be held in two sessions: from 4am to 6am and 4pm to 6pm.
 
 Last Saturday, hundreds of people formed a human chain against the proposal to cut trees on Jayamahal Road.
 
 Stall steel flyover, strengthen public transport: CPI
 
 In a statement released on Monday, the Communist Party of India – Bengaluru district council has opposed the BBMP’s plan to axe the 112 trees.
 
 “The plan exposes the underhanded manner in which BBMP and the government are pushing the steel flyover, in spite of the stay order from the National Green Tribunal. Instead of building the flyover, the government should increase BMTC buses and strengthen other modes of public transport. It should also take measures to introduce the suburban rail system, instead of pursuing elitist high-cost projects such as the steel flyover,” the release said.
 
 The council has resolved to mobilize awareness about the issue through a postcard campaign to file objections against the tree felling. Protests will be organized in front the BBMP office, the release added.
