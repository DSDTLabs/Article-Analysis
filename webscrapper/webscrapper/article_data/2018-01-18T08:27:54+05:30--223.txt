JALANDHAR: Punjab irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjeet Singh’s son   appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday for questioning in case of raising funds amounting to around Rs 80 crore (then $18 million) through global depository receipts (GDR) (foreign shares) over a decade ago for family-owned Rana Sugars allegedly without requisite permission from the   (RBI). He remained in ED office for around six and half hours. 

 Rana Gurjet has already tendered his resignation to chief minster   after facing attacks from the Opposition in sand mining case. His resignation is yet to be accepted.
 
 Rana Inder is the managing director of Rana Sugars. It is learnt that the RBI had conveyed to the ED that it had no information from Rana Sugars about floating GDRs and subsequent information about it was also not filed and even the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) flagged the issue.
 
 The ED suspects that there could be violation of the   Management Act (FEMA) in these financial transactions. The money was reportedly parked in Portugal Bank in Madeira Island briefly before transferring it to India.
 
 After coming out of the ED office, Rana Inder denied that there was any wrong doing. “We raised GDRs though automatic route as provided by the law and no permission was required. The rules required that information be given to the RBI and the same was duly given at that time. We have given a copy of that intimation.”
 
 “We raised around Rs 80 crore 12 years ago and it was reflected in the income-tax assessments. Then also clarifications were sought by the I-T department and we provided them with the same,” he said, adding, “There was no wrong doing at all and we have submitted the documents sought and have answered the queries by ED officials.”
