Seems like KV Anand’s film with   is turning out to be a multi-starrer in the truest sense. Just a couple of days after we broke the news of   star   being a part of the film, we hear that Tollywood actor Allu   is also joining the cast. Sirish had debuted in Kollywood with Radha Mohan’s Gouravam.

 An excited Sirish tells us, “I’d come down to meet Anand sir a few days ago to firm up the details. I’ve already started prepping for my role, and can’t wait to begin shoot.”
 
 Prod him about his character, and he says, “I can reveal nothing about my role except that it’s a well-etched one, and will be seen along with Suriya’s character throughout the film.”
 
 A self-confessed Suriya fan, Sirish admits he’s happy to share screen space with him. “I’ve always said in all my interviews that I like Suriya’s work in Kollywood. So many of his fans have written to me on social media, asking me to work with him. I’m happy this film has materialised,” says Sirish, adding, “I’m thankful to Anand sir for giving me this opportunity. He’s been one of my favourite directors, and I’ve seen almost all his films, Ayan, Maattrraan, Anegan, among others. Also, I’d done a film with Mohanlal sir earlier — 1971: Beyond Borders — and I feel honoured to work with him again. It’s going to be an amazing experience, working with great talents.”
