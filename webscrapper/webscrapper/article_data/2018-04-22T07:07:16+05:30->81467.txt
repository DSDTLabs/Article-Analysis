BENGALURU:   -- a novel concept that envisages conversations between   and Indian nationals in Japanese language -- is all set to be popularised in the city.

 Briefing on the Japanese Language Training and Japanese Culture and   at the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) here on Saturday, Takayuki  , Consul General of   in Bengaluru, said the event will enable Japanese professionals to identify talented Indians who can converse fluently in the language.
 
 Kitagawa, who had started the initiative in Chennai earlier, hoped it would gain traction in Bengaluru given the fact that the city has a lot of tech professionals. “Japanese Speaking Nights is also a platform where cross-country trade relationships can be formed. Bengaluru has almost 1,000 Japanese-speaking Indians,” he said.
 
 Only Japanese should be spoken during the interaction. Extempore, stand-up comedy and even one-on-one conversations can be explored, as long as the medium of communication is Japanese. Two programmes will be available to the public – a basic Japanese programme for first-time travellers to Japan and a Japanese conversation programme for long-term business relationship building.
 
 Kitagawa said Japan requires almost two lakh IT engineers and India could explore it. “Japan is an ‘ageing society’ and various technological advancements are being made to aid the elderly in Japan. Learning Japanese thus becomes important. It will allow dialogues between Indian and Japanese executives,” he said.
