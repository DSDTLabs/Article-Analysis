Chennai: Appointment of government law officers would become transparent and not based merely on ruling party affiliation, as   has directed the   government to formulate guidelines for such appointments. 

 "It is undeniable that for a fair, quick and satisfactory adjudication of litigation, the assistance which the court gets from the Bar is extremely important. Quality of judgment or justice administered by the courts is directly proportionate to the quality of assistance that courts get from counsel appearing in a case. 
 
 "Poor assistance by counsel who are not sufficiently equipped in scholarship, experience or commitment would adversely affect the administration of justice by the court. The state being party to a very large percentage of the litigation pending in the high court, should make every endeavour to make legal assistance of a high standard available to the court. No appointment should be made either for pursuing a political purpose or for giving some undue advantage to any section," said the first bench of Chief Justice   and justice  .
 
 It also directed the state government to invite applications from eligible advocates by putting up notices in places including recognised bar associations.
 
 Asserting that no lawyer has a right to be appointed as a government law officer, the court said, but every eligible lawyer has a right to be considered for appointment, if they offer themselves for appointment.
 
 The bench passed the orders on a PIL moved by advocate V Vasanthakumar challenging the Appointment of Law Officers of High Court of Madras and its Bench at Madurai (Appointment) Rules, 2017, published by the state on April 29, 2017.
