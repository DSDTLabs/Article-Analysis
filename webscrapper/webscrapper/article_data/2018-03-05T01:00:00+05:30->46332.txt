It seems like low-key, hush-hush weddings are the flavour of the season with yet another celebrity couple exchanging vows in private. BT has learnt that Keith Sequeira and   (Miss India International 2012) tied the knot on Saturday in an intimate affair in  , Tamil Nadu. The couple, who were seen together on the reality show 'Bigg Boss', got engaged in 2017 following a courtship of two-and-half years.
The wedding took place at a quiet resort, surrounded by those closest to the couple. Since the bride always wanted a destination beach wedding, the duo zeroed in on the quaint and scenic Mahabalipuram after a few trips to Rochelle’s hometown in Chennai last year. It was a low-key celebration, with white being the colour of the day. 
 Everything from the decor to the music was done in accordance with the couple’s taste. Rochelle’s sister  , who lives in Chennai, helped her plan everything and ensured that the D-day turns out to be exactly how she wanted it.
