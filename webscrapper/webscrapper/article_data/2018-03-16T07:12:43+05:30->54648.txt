MUMBAI: Drums Beat bar in Tardeo, owned by the late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray’s late son   and now in the name of the latter’s wife  , is in the news for the wrong reasons. High drama ensued late night on Wednesday when the police’s anti-narcotics cell (ANC) raided Drums Beat, but the cops were manhandled by five bouncers. There was further chaos when the   police, called for help, could not identify the   police team who were in mufti.

 Two policemen were injured when they broke open the doors of small cubicles, which are makeup rooms, and where girl dancers were suspected to have been hidden. The cops were injured when the bouncers intervened, preventing them from carrying out their duty.
 
 A source said that based on a number of complaints, police commissioner Datta Padsalgikar issued a special instruction, telling ANC deputy commissioner   to monitor the bar. Locals had complained that the bar was working beyond its permissible time limit and was illegally engaging girls as bar dancers.
 
 “Around 11.30pm, the ANC team entered the bar and secretly started video clipping six girls who were dancing provocatively. When the cops started their raid, the girls fled into the rooms. In the melee, the ANC team called up local police, but then they weren’t of much help,” said a source.
