Singer   revealed that   has collaborated with him on his new album. 

  
  
 Sheeran, 25, who performed with Mayer at the 2015 GRAMMYs, as well as on 'The Late Late Show' that year, said the 39-year-old singer-songwriter has played a guitar solo in his album, pronounced as 'Divide'.
 
 "I got John Mayer on a guitar solo that's uncredited that's quite cool. I did a really terrible guitar solo on a song and I was like, 'I bet John Mayer could do this better.' So I emailed him and he did it a lot better," he said. 
 
 In addition to a brief pause from  , the 'Thinking Out Loud' hitmaker also took a year-long break from social media, which he attributes to not knowing how to deal with fame. 
 
 "I'm still a pretty simple person anyway, so I'm still living in simpler times. Fame is like, you just have to find a way to deal with it in your own way, and the reason I took the break is I didn't know how to deal with it so I wasn't really enjoying it. 
 
 "I've now kind of recharged my batteries and thought about why I was in the music industry and came back with a sort of different view and I don't really mind, like I'm really grateful that people have a lot of love for the music I make which is nice," he said.
