HYDERABAD: Former RBI governor D Subbarao on Thursday said that demonetisation has been the most disruptive policy innovation in India since the 1991 economic reforms and has led to a flurry of innovation in the financial sector with a new crop of fin-tech companies gaining a foothold. "While the objectives, costs and benefits of demonetisation are a subject matter of contentious debate, what is not contentious is that demonetisation has possibly been the most disruptive policy innovation in India since the 1991 reforms. We can look at demonetization from two perspectives. First, whatever is happening in India is a continuation of what is happening in the world (technology coming in the financial sector) and the other way to see it is as a discontinuous move in technology coming into the financial sector. Either way , we will have disruptive innovations in the financial sector," Subbarao said. He added that these new breed of fin-tech startups will certainly pose a challenge to the traditional banking sector as they are more efficient and are not saddled with the limitations of geography and regulations, among others."From payments to wealth management, from peer-to-peer lending to crowd funding, a new generation of startups is taking aim at the heart of the industry and revolutionizing how finance is done...These fin-tech companies are changing finance by cutting costs and improving the quality of financial services. They also have better ways of assessing risk and are not burdened by geography or regulation," he said. The former governor was delivering the keynote address at a conference organised at the Institute for Development & Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) here. Rao pointed out that banks need to change their attitude and might have to deploy strategies like taking over new areas of businesses like they did with ATMs. This apart, they can build alliances with smaller entities such as payment banks and cede the last mile connectivity to them.
