NEW DELHI: Boxer   claimed a silver after losing to England's   in the men's flyweight category at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast [Australia] on Saturday.

 
 
 
 Amit lost a close bout after going down 28-29, 27-30, 29-28, 28-28, 28-29 via split verdict. 
 
 The 22-year-old Amit originally hails from Mayna village near Rohtak [Haryana], where he was spotted by coach Anil Dhankar, who is from the same village. The coach has trained Amit since he was a kid. 
 
 Amit won a bronze at the AIBA World Boxing Championships last year and this is his first appearance in the Commonwealth Game. His tendency of getting overawed led to Amitâ€™s defeat in the semis of the World Championships at the hands of Olympic Champion Hasanboy Dusmatov last year. But his coach says the young pugilist has learnt from that experience.
 
 Amit trained at the Combat Boxing Club in Sector 39 under Dhankar for several years before joining the Army as a junior commissioned officer. But he still makes it a point to visit his old academy and coach every time he is in town. 
 
 In Gurgaon, Amit is a stalwart despite his age. In the three state-level competitions he has participated in here, he has triumphed every single time without losing a single round.
