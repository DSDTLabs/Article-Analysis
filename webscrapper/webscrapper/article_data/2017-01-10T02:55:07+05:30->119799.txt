NEW DELHI: Refusing to take a stand whether former CM Sheila Dikshit’s decision to trifurcate the erstwhile MCD was at the root of the current financial crisis in the east corporation, Delhi   chief   on Monday blamed both BJP and   for failing to solve the problem. 

 He challenged the two parties to make amendments to the MCD Act and unify the three corporations if they believed that the trifurcation was the main cause of financial problems. Maken also blamed BJP, which leads the corporations, for poor management of finances and attacked the AAP government for inadequate fund allocation and non-implementation of the fourth Delhi Finance Commission’s report. 
 
 He said the then Congress government had allocated Rs 1881.35 crore to the corporations, out of a total annual plan outlay of Rs 16,000 crore—which was 11.76% of the total budget. “In the next three years, including the President’s Rule and two years of AAP government, the plan outlay saw a shortfall of around Rs 1,600 crore, which has led to the financial crisis at the east corporation,” Maken said in a press conference.
 
 He alleged when Delhi was under President’s Rule during 2014-15, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley slashed the outlay of the corporations in the Delhi budget substantially. 
 
 Rejecting Maken’s allegations, a Delhi government spokesperson said, “We wanted to implement the 4th DFC report but the Centre did not adopt the recommendations about giving Delhi a larger share in the central taxes. The   Reform Fund that we have given the corporation too is something it does not deserve. MCDs have given us no status report on reforms done but we have still given funds...They have to come up with utilisation certificates and plans to seek more funds”.
