KOCHI: Contract workers under the government are entitled to  , on par with regular employees, the high court has held.

 The ruling by Justice   came after considering two petitions filed by women working on contractual basis under the state government. They were allowed maternity leave only for 90 days whereas regular employees were entitled to leave of six months. A petition filed by   and four others was considered as the lead case by the court.
 
 In the judgment, the court said, “The petitioners are admittedly women employees working on a contract basis under state funded projects. The benefits of enhanced maternity leave to women employees is undoubtedly a piece of welfare legislation which is intended to give women equal opportunities in public employment. In the above view of the matter, the contention raised to the effect that the   under the projects are entitled to only 90 days of  , according to me, cannot be countenanced, since it would amount to discrimination against women employees only for the reason that they are engaged in projects in contractual capacities.”
 
 “The inalienable obligations of maternity should not and cannot be a reason to deny equal opportunities to women employees. This precisely would be the result of limiting maternity leave to women employees, irrespective of the nature of their employment,” it added.
 
 The state government had contended that granting six-month leave to a woman employed on a one-year contract would obliterate the benefit of the employment. The court said such a contention cannot be raised in the present cases as the employees were continuing in service on the basis of successive extension of contract.
