LUDHIANA: Even two months after demonetisation, things seem to be looking bleak, especially for owners of marriage palaces, who have lost as much as 70% of their business, as compared to 2015. There are no weddings or very small-scale ones as of now. But another upcoming festival seems to be hit by the cash crunch, and that is Lohri, which is usually very vibrant and lively in this region. Lohri this year just seems to have lost its verve. However, though not many wedding functions are being organised in January and February, the situation is definitely better than in November and December.
 
 Amarjit Singh, president of  , said: "Post-demonetisation, our business has been hit very hard, and this season is almost gone in terms of wedding functions. Even the Lohri season is not the same as last year. Though bookings are coming for Lohri, there are very few and extremely low-scale. The number is far less than last year, but as the saying goes, ‘something is better than nothing'. Otherwise, it is a very poor Lohri season. We have chucked out 50% of our labour, and have never faced so much financial hardship as this year. In the months of November and December, I have done hardly 5-7 functions." 
 
 Amar Vir Singh, vice-president of  , said: "There is very less improvement in the past two months. The number of weddings and scale of weddings have drastically come down. Weddings which previously had a gathering of 500 people now manage only 200. Only those people are conducting weddings who have already distributed their cards, or those who may be under some other compulsion. Lohri celebrations are generally huge in this city, and two weeks before Lohri, almost every hotel used to be booked on weekends as well as weekdays. But this year, it's different. Lohri functions are on an extremely low scale, though the festival holds so much importance in Punjab, specially for those who are blessed with a newborn, and for a newly wed couple. Since last year, people have started celebrating Lohri for girls too, which is good for us."
 
 Gurpreet Singh, secretary of the association, said: "Though my wedding palace is in Mullanpur, my work is more in rural areas. But our condition is very bad this year. And for Lohri, we have never seen such low energy in Punjab. Until last year, so many NRIs used to come for wedding as well as Lohri functions, but this year, even NRIs have not turned up, due to ‘notebandi'. The current situation is chaotic, giving us a very tough time. More than 250 Lohri functions took place in the first two weeks of last year, but now there are hardly 40-50 Lohri functions, and that too low-scale. Those who are doing so are either borrowing money for it, or those families are celebrating it who have received good news after a long time. Actually, this season is completely gone."
