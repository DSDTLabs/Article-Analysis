TRICHY: A prankster evading arrest by the city police for over six months has landed in their net after the investigation and forensic tests helped to corner him. A special police team arrested  , 34, a photographer from T Valavanur near Lalgudi who was out on bail in a similar case from the outskirts of Trichy on Monday. 

 He was arrested in connection with the hoax bomb letter case registered in the Cantonment police station on July 5 last year. He had posted two separate letters to City Union Bank (CUB) and Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) in the city stating that there will be a bomb explosion in their banks at 3.30 pm on July 6. The handwritten letter had the name of a Muslim organisation from Palakkarai. 
 
 Though the police had no clue about the prankster, the recently formed special team decided to verify the similarities between a hoax letter sent by the man to   temple in 2015 and the letters posted to the banks. The investigation by the forensic lab in Madurai found similarities between the two handwritings based on which the police shifted the focus on him. 
 
 Muruganandham was out on bail after he was arrested in the Srirangam temple bomb threat case. The police pulled up his phone call records and tracked the movement of his mobile number near   in Trichy where he posted the letters. Their suspicions proved to be correct and they arrested him. “He did this just for the thrill,” claimed sub-inspector H Mohammed Ibrahim of cantonment police. He was produced in court which remanded him in judicial custody.
