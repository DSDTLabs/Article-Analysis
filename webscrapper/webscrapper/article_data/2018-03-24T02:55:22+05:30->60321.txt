TIRUVURU (Krishna district): In a tragic incident, two kids accidentally drowned inside   pond near a Lord Shiva temple in Tiruvuru town in   on Friday.

 The deceased were identified as Nelluri Chakravarthi (10), a class III student and Veeranki Lokesh (8) from Nara Koduru village in   district. According to Tiruvuru police, the incident happened at around 2 pm, when both the kids were playing near the pond while their parents went to the temple together to offer prayers.
 
 Later, they realised that the kids were missing and began searching for more than an hour. Soon, they found the boys slippers lying outside the pond and they immediately jumped into to see if they fell inside. To their shock, locals recovered both the boys’ bodies from the pond. Upon information, cops reached the spot and examined the scene and believe that they must have gone inside the pond to take a dip. Both the bodies were sent to a local government hospital for post-mortem.
 
 A case under section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) was registered at Tiruvuru police station. The investigation is still on. Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended the town as parents prepare to bid final adieu to the kids. Chakravarthi’s father is a goat herder while Lokesh’s father passed away few years ago.
