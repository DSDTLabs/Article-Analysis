PUNE: A   rescued an 18-month-old   from a   on Kondhwa Road on Thursday evening. The dog had been stuck in the narrow space for nearly 48 hours before it could be extricated.

 The stray dog slipped into the manhole as a portion of its cover had been opened to clean the drain on Tuesday. However, passers-by did not notice the incident immediately.
 
 On Thursday, around 3.45pm, Mohammad Murshid Ali Khan (27) was passing on the same road when he found the manhole open on one side and heard a dog barking. Khan, who works as a manager at an optical showroom, told TOI that on peeping inside the manhole, he found the dog. “I provided information about the incident to the fire brigade at Kondhwa. A fire tender rushed to the spot in about fifteen minutes, removed lid of the manhole, and started the   operation,” Khan stated.
 
 At first a team of  , comprising Dilip Bibwe, Ravindra Hiwarkar, Subhash Khade and Sagar Dalvi, tried to save the dog after getting hold of its leg using a noose.
 
 After the initial effort failed, they tried to maneuver the dog’s leg to put in the noose with the help of a rod. The team was able to securely pull the dog by 4.20pm.
 
 Hiwarkar shared, “It took us some time to rescue the dog because it was panicking and barking. We removed the dog in a well-planned rescue operation. The dog’s legs had swollen due to injuries.”
 
 Once the dog had been brought out from the manhole, Shubada Bhalkikar, an animal lover who was in the vicinity, covered the dog with a gunny bag since it was shivering and also offered it some biscuits.
 
 Bhalkikar said, “We have admitted the dog at Blue Cross Hospital in Mundhwa for treatment. Two hours later, the dog was said to be in a better condition.”
