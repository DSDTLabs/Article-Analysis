When you have a   director who is precise with his work and has a great vision of his film, everything falls into place, including the music. Those are the exact sentiments that  , the   director of 3 Ghante, 30 Dina, 30 Second, has about the film’s director, Madhusudan GK. “We worked together on the tunes and  , and having his inputs provided the right vision for the tracks, for which we got singers like Sonu Nigam and Vijay Prakash on board,” says Sridhar. 

 “The film has a lot of character and varied situations. For me, as a music director, it was interesting, as I could explore a lot. Since melody is my forte — right from Mussanje Maathu till now — working on this film was a challenge, considering that it is a thriller. But Madhusudan is a perfect technician — he’s very precise, especially with respect to the lyrics,” says Sridhar, explaining, “The situations in which songs appear in most films are the same. There will be an introduction song, a romantic number and so on. When I take on a film, though, I look at how best I can represent my work in the narrative. I always think about how the music will sound and strive to produce great music. It’s always a challenge, but this was a good one. I am very happy with the final product,” says Sridhar, adding that the lyrics of the songs add a lot of value to his work.
 
 “For example, the lyrics of Ardha Chandra Moodidanthe have been beautifully written by Jayant Kaikini. He has added a poetic touch to the song,” says Sridhar. Ask him about Aaroythu Deepa Aaroythu, for which he has lent his voice, and the music man adds, “This is the first time that I have sung a song for a film. It was an unexpected decision. We had asked a few track singers to sing this number, but Madhusudan insisted that I sing it and I eventually took the opportunity,” Sridhar signs off.
