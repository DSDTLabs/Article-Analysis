MUMBAI: Almost 25 years ago, a group named the   built a three-room structure at the gate of Sion crematorium. For a fee of Rs 500 per day, they rented the rooms to Tamil Brahmin families who wished to perform the death ceremonies of departed relatives.

 Families would arrive to hold rituals, condolence meetings, cook the customary feast and distribute alms. The practice continued since 1993.
 
 There was one problem though -- the structure was unauthorised. On Monday the local F North ward demolished the building after following due process of law. Ward officer   said, "It was an unauthorised structure. There is no question of granting an alternate site to the group."
 
 The secretary of the league C K Ganesh said, "We had taken this place on leave and license basis. Since 2010 the authorities stopped collecting rent. We even paid a penalty a few years ago. But they demolished it saying they need space to expand the crematorium and to build a biogas plant as part of the facility."
 
 Resident   claimed the demolition would create a void for mourners. "Now they have no place to perform the rites for the deceased and will either have to go to Chheda Nagar, Navi Mumbai or Mulund. The social service league was serving a need in the community. There are several illegal structures which the authorities can address."
 
 C K Ganesh said that they would find it hard to build another centre in the locality. "For one, rent amounts are exorbitant these days, and moreover, how do we rustle up funds for construction. We were barely making Rs 10,000 per month from the earlier facility which did not even cover our operational costs. We used the interest from our corpus to fund our activities," he said.
