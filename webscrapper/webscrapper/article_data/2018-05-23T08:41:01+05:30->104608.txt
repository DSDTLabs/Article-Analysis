JABALPUR: The mob that lynched a man and critically injured another on suspicion of cow slaughter in Satna also robbed them, says the family of the survivor who is battling for life at a   hospital.

 
 Early on Friday, Maihar residents Shiraj, 45, and Shakeel, 35, were attacked by a group that accused them of cow slaughter. Shiraj died on the spot, and Shakeel was critically injured. Police arrested four suspects for lynching and booked Shakeel for cow slaughter after allegedly recovering meat and skeleton of a ‘bull’.
 
 Shakeel’s wife   said on Tuesday, “My husband is a driver. An acquaintance in   owed him Rs 5,000. On Thursday evening, he left on a motorcycle with Shiraj, our neighbour and family friend to get the money. At 10pm, I talked with him and asked him to halt for the night in Kaimur as it was very late, but he said he would return home. The next morning, around 5am, I received a call from Satna that he had been beaten up. We rushed to Satna and found him covered in blood.”
 
 According to Shanno, Shakeel told him on the way to Jabalpur that their motorcycle got a flat tyre and they were pushing it along when some people stopped them and asked them their “name, caste and religion”. “When they identified themselves, some other people also arrived and attacked them. They robbed them of everything they had, including the Rs 5,000,” she said. “Now, he is battling for life and we finding it hard to arrange required money for his treatment.”
 
 “Till now, they have deposited only Rs 10,000. We have not stopped treatment and are not discharging the patient, but have advised the family to shift to a government hospital, if they feel, as the treatment costs could cause them financial stress,” said Dr Sunil Asati of the private hospital where Shakeel is admitted.
