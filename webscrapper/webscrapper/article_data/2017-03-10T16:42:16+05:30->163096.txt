PANAJI: In a bid to maintain some discipline in the celebrations,   wants to introduce and enforce changes in the way the shigmo festival is conducted in the state capital. Announcing the schedule for the shigmotsav, Corporation of the city of Panaji commissioner Dipak Dessai said that there would be negative marking for those floats that don’t adhere to guidelines.

 The shigmotsav float parade would be held on March 18 and would include floats, romtamel, folk dance and individual fancy dress participants. To prevent a law and order situation, it has also been decided to do away with the prize distribution ceremony, Dessai said.
 
 “The idea is to control and have discipline in the float parade. We are cultured people and there has to be discipline. Just like carnival, the shigmo parade must start and end on time,” Dessai said.
 
 The organizing committee’s expenditure projections for the festivities are around Rs 24 lakh with   contributing Rs 20 lakh.
 
 This time around, the fervor of shigmo will grip the capital for seven days, with the traditional romtamel parade and gulalotsav being held on March 13. The festivities will continue till March 19.
 
 Accepting that the Shigmo festival would pose an inconvenience to the city’s residents and commercial establishments, both Dessai and deputy superintendent of police (Traffic)   suggested that it would be better if festivals such as carnival and shigmotsav were held outside the city limits.
 
 To ensure that traffic flowed smoothly, 18th June road would be sealed from 12pm of March 18. The organizing committee would penalize those floats that did not maintain the distance between floats. “The distance between floats shall not exceed 15 metres and points shall be deducted if this condition is violated,” Dessai said.
