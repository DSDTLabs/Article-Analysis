KOLKATA: West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson   on Saturday filed an FIR against  , an organisation that had organised a workshop on ‘garbha samskar and dampati sameekshan’ on Harish Mukherjee Road, alleging that she was abused and heckled and her modesty was outraged after she was refused entry into the venue. 

 Chakraborti had on Thursday filed a PIL against Arogya Bharati for allegedly trying to propagate designer babies at the workshop. The court, in its order on Friday, allowed Arogya Bharati to conduct the workshop, but laid down several conditions. It asked the organizers to refund any registration fee, desist from holding any kind of training or treatment and record the proceedings, including an ayurveda lecture, and present it before the court within a fortnight.
 
 “Following the court order, I came to see the proceedings. I wanted to be sure that the organisers were recording everything, as this is a matter of public welfare. However, the organisers did not allow me to enter. They hurled expletives at me and heckled me,” she said. Reporters who had gathered at the gate of Ekal Bhavan, the workshop venue, were also denied entry. “If the programme is scientific, why are they being so secretive?” Chakraborti asked.
 
 A large number of couples had registered for the workshop. “We have read a lot about  , but no one taught this here,” said Rakesh Singh, who came with his wife Swati to attend the workshop. “There are teachings in our ancient traditions, but very few know them. The workshop will clarify many things about garbha samskar, one of our 16 samskars,” said Seema Sen, who believed that kids born after following this samskar will be different from those born otherwise. 
 
 Rights activists Urmi Basu of New Light and Tinku Khanna of Apne Aap, who acco-mpanied the commission representatives, were also denied entry.
