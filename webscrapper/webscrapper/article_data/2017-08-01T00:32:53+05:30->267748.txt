It was touted as a ‘model footpath’ laid with costly granite slabs, but now craters and rubble keep pedestrians off it. The pavement on   was given a facelift in 2016 but barely a year later, the   has ripped it apart.

 The stretch got a makeover for Rs 10 crore after the corporation decided to beautify it in 2014. After missing two deadlines, the black-topped road made way for a cement one while the older footpath was widened to 10m and spruced up with granite tiles. Stylish lights on the medians and dedicated parking slots were added even as squatters, who found another pavement to occupy, were given a boot.
 
 But residents in the locality said the tiles came apart after   workers broke open the footpath and left transmission cables lying out in the open. TNEB sources told TOI that they were attending to an emergency power fault complaint. “The main transmission line developed a snag at a few places. Power supply to the area was cut. Because this area has a few influential residents, including   officers, we were asked to restore power immediately and start the rectification later,” a TNEB official said. “To restore power, we had to lay an alternate transmission cable to bypass the faulty joints. It couldn’t be done immediately without breaking open the footpath. The repair work is almost complete. We will restore the footpath,” the official added.
 
 Corporation officials told TOI that they were intimated by TNEB before the work started. “The work was approved at the zonal level. But TNEB has paid a deposit sum for the damage. We will use the money to restore the footpath,” a senior official said.
 
 Harrington Road has over 850 houses, seven schools and two hospitals besides other commercial establishments. The road witnesses heavy four-wheeler and two-wheeler movement on a daily basis, especially during school hours. The footpath had been very useful for children to safely commute to school.
