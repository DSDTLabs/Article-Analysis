BHOPAL: City-based activist  , on whose petition   had earlier made the   compulsory in cinemas, says he will move the inter-ministerial committee that is being set up by the government on the issue.

 “It should be made mandatory not only in cinemas but also in schools,” he insists. Soon after   modified its 2016 order on Tuesday, and made the anthem optional at cinemas, Chouksey told TOI: “I will make a representation before the inter-ministerial committee that will be constituted by the government to look into the issue. I have not seen the detailed order of the Supreme Court but my lawyer has informed that the court has kept the option open for the petitioner to put forth his representation before the panel.” It should be made compulsory in private school, too, he said.
 
 Chouksey had also petitioned SC to restrict commercial use of the national anthem. “Ultimately, it’s   that makes law and I will put forth all the evidences of dishonour and put up the matter before the government committee,” he said.
 
 The 77-year old Bhopal resident started a campaign against dishonour of the national anthem after being upset by the way it was portrayed in a 2001 Bollywood blockbuster, and how people didn’t stand up when it was played on screen. In 2002, he moved a petition before Madhya Pradesh high court against the “dishonour” to the anthem. In year 2003, MPHC banned screening of the movie, which was set aside by Supreme Court. For the next eight years, Chouksey collected evidence of dishonour to the national anthem, and filed a fresh petition in SC in 2016.
