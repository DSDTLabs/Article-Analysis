SURAT: City police will ban four-wheelers on   to   road for smooth traffic flow on this stretch from 10 am to 12 noon and 5 to 7 pm. The ban will be imposed from January 5 on a trial basis for one month and it could be extended. 

 The road known as   witnessed major redevelopment during the tenure of municipal commissioner   when buildings were demolished on both sides to widen it. However, the width of the road is proving insufficient for growing traffic after two decades and the police are now looking at different options to improve things. 
 
 This 2.5km stretch of road has grown into a market over the past four centuries and now attracts customers from across south Gujarat. Even after emergence of   and Gaurav Path as new market areas, Raj Marg did not lose its charm especially among non-resident Indians. However, with growing traffic issues, the road remains jam most of the time during any day. It takes around 15 minutes to cover the 2.5km stretch in a car and even more in a bus as the road remains clogged during the peak hours. Parking of cars along the crowded road has made it difficult for traffic police to keep the traffic moving even during non-peak hours. 
 
 “City police are imposing a ban on four-wheelers on Raj Marg during peak hours because of traffic issues. There are regular complaints of traffic jam on the road and hence we are working on options before us to deal with the problem. Ban on cars will reduce traffic on road that is already narrow and improve movement of traffic. Police will seek reactions of the owners of business establishments during the trial of one month,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said. 
 
 Meanwhile, police have started strict implementation of parking on both sides of the road alternatively on odd-even days. So far parking norms were not being followed.
