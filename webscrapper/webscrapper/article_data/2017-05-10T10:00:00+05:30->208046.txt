 I am a 38-year-old woman, married for 15 years and have a 12-year-old son. My husband stays abroad and visits us once in a couple of months. During this phase, I got intimate with a tailor and we got into a sexual relationship. I am now 5 months pregnant and I don’t want to get an abortion, as I feel it’s unfair. I have also informed my husband about my   and the pregnancy through calls and texts. He has been positive about the same and is also ready to support me and my child. My husband understands my   and accepts that he has been away for the greed of money. 

 I like my sexual partner, this pregnancy and I’ve started disliking my husband. Now, I wish to stay with my partner, who is unmarried and is ready to marry me. My son likes him and is very close to him.
  
 On the other hand, my husband refuses to come back to India and is not ready to take us there. My biggest question is how long do I stay alone? I feel like I need to move out, be happy with this man who has given me a child and immense satisfaction. What would be the consequences? I am still in a big dilemma.
  
 
 
 This is a huge predicament and I understand arriving at a decision must be harrowing for you. There is a lot to contemplate and that's why you are worried about the consequences. This is a complex situation and there are various aspects you need to think about before you make a final decision.
