PUNE: The   ( ) and the College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), have made it to the shortlist of 100 institutions in the race to be named Institutes of Eminence (IoE).

  With the   allocating Rs 10,000 crore for the 20 chosen institutes, the SPPU and the CoEP, if selected, could be awarded up to Rs 1,000 crore each. They will also get significant academic autonomy.
 
 The ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) will select 10 private ( and 10 public educational institutions. The results will be announced by the end of March.
 
 Talking about the university’s chances of earning the IoE tag, Arvind Shaligram, SPPU’s officiating registrar, said, “The selection process is tough. A high-power committee will be appointed to scrutinise each application followed by a rigorous selection procedure. The university has given its best shot and has applied in a proper way.”
 
 BB  , CoEP director, said, “The rank, as per the National Institutional Ranking Framework, will definitely play a role. We are already in the top 25. Though we are ranked 24th in the list, I feel as a college, we are ranked first. This is because all the 23 institutions ahead of us are degree-awarding institutes. I feel the selection would also take this into consideration. The consistency that we have shown over the past few years would also be a plus. I am sure the selectors will look at the entire picture — the kind of work that we do here and the research that we are pursuing.”
 
 He said. “If we are selected, the funding will help us compete with the top universities, which is the state’s ultimate aim for the IoE scheme.”
