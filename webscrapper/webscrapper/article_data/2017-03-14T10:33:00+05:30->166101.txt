HYDERABAD: After a portion of road adjacent to the accident site caved in, residents heaved a sigh of relief as the busy stretch usually sees heavy vehicular movement. 

 "A small portion that caved in, but if there were cars, maybe a bigger tragedy could have occurred," said Ashok Shah, a local. While authorities began probing whether the contractor in-charge of the under-construction project ate into the road space, they clearly said that the mandatory four-metre distance from the road was not maintained.
 
 At the site of the accident, the metal sheet barricades were put up right at the point from where excavation began. "Since a soil check was not done and a portion of the mud caved in along with half a meter of the road, the road now stands on weak ground. If a heavy vehicle had been passing through at the time of the tragedy, the situation could have been disastrous," said a   official assessing the damage.
 
 Hundreds of techies in the area use this road every day. On Monday, authorities lucked out as there were not many commuters since it was a holiday.
 
 "I usually take this road to go to ORR each day. Just two days back I almost banged into the barricade. Now that I can seeing the site excavated to such a depth right after the barricade, I am shocked. Had I hit the barricade with more force, I would have plunged 40 feet below with my two-wheeler. It could have either died or sustained a serious injury," said a passerby B Ramesh.
 
 While builders are supposed to put up a retaining wall around the excavation site, there wasn't any at the  . GHMC authorities said that they have booked a criminal case against the builder for now following safety measures.
