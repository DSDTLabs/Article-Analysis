AJMER: Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) has started working on a blueprint for security of question papers of the board examinations. Two to three policemen will be deputed at every examination centre. Also, the board will conduct videography of examination centres in extra sensitive districts.

 On Saturday, the board released roll numbers and other details of the examination on its website. 
 
 Secretary of board,  , has asked schools to verify the information of students and apply for valid changes, if necessary. 10,86,075 students have registered for Class X board examination in the state which will start from March 9.
 
 According to sources, question paper security is a major task for the board. Officials have selected the police stations and chowkis where the papers will be kept safe. “For schools where there is no police station or chowki nearby, the papers will be kept in nodal school of that cluster and there will be round-the-clock security,” said an official.
 
 The board will call a meeting of district education officers soon to brief them about the security blueprint which the board has prepared. “The major task of the board is security of question papers as the number of students is large,” said an official. 
 
 The education officers will take the responsibility of question paper security. They will also learn about the process of distribution of question papers at the examination centres. 
 
 RBSE is also planning to recruit border home guard battalion for security purpose besides asking aid from government to install   cameras at examination centres. 
 
 “The preparations have already started and from next week practical examinations of classes X and XII will begin. This time too, observers will be appointed by the board mostly in private schools for practical examinations,” said an official.
