 Kannan gave contradicting replies to the police and was spotted to be somewhere in Chennai. On further questioning, Kannan told the police that Senthil was killed and his body was abandoned in Manthithopu. Based on his statement, police went to the spot and found him dead with his head smashed with a stone.
 
 The body was sent to the   Medical College Hospital for postmortem and the man missing case was altered as murder. Three special teams are also on the lookout for Kannan. According to police, preliminary inquiry revealed that Senthil was into money lending and was not in good terms with some clients. He is also said to have a few associates like Kannan, whose services he availed when he faced trouble from borrowers. It is suspected that he could have been murdered over one such issue.
 
 Meanwhile, on Friday three youths surrendered before a Virudhunagar court in connection with the murder. Police said they would know the reason behind the murder only after arresting Kannan or taking the trio in police custody.
