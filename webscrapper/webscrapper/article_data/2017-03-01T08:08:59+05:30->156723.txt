KOCHI:   have no right to refuse to release the   who did not undergo   in  ,   has ruled.

 The managements could only take steps against the students who failed to undertake rural service under civil law and the bonds signed by the students at the time of admission did not empower the managements to retain their certificates, the court said.
 
 A single bench of the court issued the order after considering a petition filed by students of MES Medical College at Perinthalmanna in Malappuram questioning the management's decision not to return the original certificates submitted at the time of admission. The students who approached the court had taken admissions in merit seats during 2010-11.
 
 As per an agreement entered into between the college management and the state government, students who obtained admissions in government quota had to submit bonds undertaking that they would undergo service in rural areas for one year after completion of course.
 
 When the petitioners failed to serve in rural areas upon completion of the course, the management had asked them to pay Rs13 lakh each as fine.When they failed to pay up, the management declined to issue transfer certificates and conduct certificates as well as return the SSLC and Plus Two certificates submitted at the time of admission.
 
 While stating that the managements could not retain the certificates, the court also said compulsory rural service was included in the prospectus for the course and it could not be avoided. However, the management could not be allowed to retain the certificates of students as it was against public interest and public good, the court said.If the students failed to discharge their obligations regarding compulsory rural service, the management could seek remedy by filing civil cases, the court stated.
