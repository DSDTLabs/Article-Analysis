LUCKNOW:   on Sunday was sworn in as the 21st chief minister of UP, but with a slight difference. For a change, he was identified as   by Governor   when the latter invited him to take the oath of office and secrecy at the gala event. 

 While talking oath, Yogi himself read out: Main, Adityanath Yogi ..... (I, Adityanath Yogi) and completed his oath. Later, the name Adityanath Yogi came up at the name plate outside CM’s official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow as well.
 
 The change, according to religious heads, has come primarily because “Yogi” is a religious title and something that Adityanath has not used in his political life in the past as well. In his affidavit filed for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he had identified himself as Adityanath with no title attached to the name.
