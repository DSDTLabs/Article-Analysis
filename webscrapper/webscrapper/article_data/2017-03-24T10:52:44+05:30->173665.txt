NEW DELHI: Going by Union minister  's reply to a tweet this morning, it appears that many Indians living legally in Britain are getting "fake calls" saying they will be deported.

 A woman of Indian origin who lives in London alerted external affairs minister Swaraj that she received such a phone call from a phone number listed on the UK Home Office's website.
 
  
  
 It was Swaraj's reply that made it sound like other Indians, too, have reported receving such calls. "All such calls are fake," Swaraj replied: 
 
 
  
  
 
 The woman living in London added in her tweets that the phone call was "due to some crime (that) got reported in India" and that her employer confirmed with the Home Office that "the call was fake."
 
  
  
 She further said the caller "threatened" her saying they will "send police" to her address.
 
 
  
 Such incidents have been earlier reported as being part of 'fake call centre crimes' or hate crimes.
 
 Earlier this month, British charities expressed alarm at "deeply worrying" new police figures that showed a considerable rise in   over the last year, The Independent reported.
 
 The Metropolitan Police statistics reveal an increase in almost all forms of hate-related crime, including incidents linked to disability, racial and homophobic motives, The Independent revealed.
 
 The number of victims of religious and racist hate crime rose almost 20 percent, to 16,618, from 14,004, and victims of faith hate saw an 18 percent increase, to 2,000 from 1,699, within the same time period.
 
 Yesterday, police identified the man who carried out a 
  a day previously as one 
  , a 52-year-old born and brought up in Britain. In the attack, which ISIS claimed responsibility for, an assailant ploughed a car through a crowd of pedestrians and then stabbed a policeman outside  . Five people, including the assailant who was shot dead, were killed in the   and more than 20 were injured, many "catastrophically".
