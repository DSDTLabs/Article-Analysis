 Before anything, know that Diplo was the guy who collaborated with   on 'Slumdog Millionaire’s' 'Paper Planes'. While all is not well with Diplo and MIA, the record producer has come out with an EP titled 'California' made up of six tracks that will blow your mind. The producer has collaborated with the edgiest indie artists, including Lil Xan, GoldLink, Suicidal, Designer and Trippie Redd in a down-tempo set that is not just musically, but even aesthetically pleasing. Google these names to realise the range of artists that the producer has tried to introduce. Diplo’s first album was 'Florida', pushed him into the limelight and it was something that changed the game when it comes to sounds. With 'California', 14 years later, he’s doing just that. From the first track with Lil Xan, to any other track among the six, all tunes are special. Diplo’s skills as a deejay are brought to the fore with each track. 
 The tracks, unlabeled, are in a way, open-source. You can listen to them, jive and then mix. Though not an up-tempo record, 'California' is a mix of tunes where Diplo has exploited all the artists for the best that is in them. Be prepared for trip-hop, piano melodies and a mad drum beat. This one is for the listeners and the dancers.
