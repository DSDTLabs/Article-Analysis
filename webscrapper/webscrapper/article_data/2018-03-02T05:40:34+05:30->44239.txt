HYDERABAD: Over 50% child marriages stopped by   police took place in   town under the commissionerate, said Mahesh Bhagwat, Rachakonda commissioner. In 11 months, 24 child marriages were stopped under the commissionerate. 

 "Bhongir town is a rural area and   cases are rampant there. Of the 24 child marriages, 15 were stopped in Bhongir town," he said. 
 
 Rachakonda police identified that child marriages are more prevalent in rural areas than urban areas. Police said awareness about laws on prohibition of child marriages in rural must be increased. 
 
 According to Mahesh Bhagwat, Rachakonda police have come up with plans to increase awareness on the harmful consequences of child marriage in the districts. 
 
 "Many educated people are also involved in such cases. Most people just want to do away with their responsibility by marrying their daughter young. Some parents even said they fear their daughter might have an affair and elope," said Bhagwat.
