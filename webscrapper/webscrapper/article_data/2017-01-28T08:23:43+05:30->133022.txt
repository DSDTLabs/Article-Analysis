PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ) will set up free Wi-Fi networks on its air-conditioned buses which will soon ply on the city’s roads. 

 “There was a popular demand for Wi-Fi at the public meetings which are being organized to develop a business plan,” D P More, PMPML’s joint managing director, told TOI. “And so, the   will have a   to enhance the passenger experience, and we are sure this will attract more people to public transport,” he added. 
 
 Earlier this month, PMPML had announced that 550 AC buses will be acquired on contract in a bid to strengthen the public transport system. Half that number will run on   (BRTS) corridors.
 
 “Buses already running on these routes will be shifted to normal routes,” More said. “This is a way to improve and popularize the BRTS services in the city. Once the AC buses arrive, we will finalize the routes,” he pointed out.
 
 However, another official said the PMPML is yet to decide “whether to introduce Wi-Fi services at the bus stops and stations.” 
 
 “We are are focusing on suggestions that can be implemented immediately. Before introducing Wi-Fi at bus stands, there are issues, particularly related to security, which need to be addressed. Other agencies, like police, need to be consulted,” the official said.
 
 A restructuring of fares of the air-conditioned buses will be carried out.
 
 Commuters, meanwhile, had mixed reactions. “Introducing Wi-Fi in these new buses will certainly prove popular, especially among the youngsters. It will encourage them to use buses. However, with new services come higher fares, and the PMPML must have to bear in mind that most commuters belong to the lower middle-class,” said  , a student.
