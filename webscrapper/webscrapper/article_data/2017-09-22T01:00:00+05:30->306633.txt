Boasting of a stellar cast comprising names like  ,  , Geetanjali Kulkarni and Palomi Ghosh;  , directed by 24-year-old   Bhutiani has been transcending borders and winning global acclaim from audience and critics alike since its release. Revolving around a father-son relationship and a heartrending tale of life and death, the film that won two National Awards and 10 international awards, has released in 50 countries (theatrically) and is continuing its winning streak at prestigious international festivals. 

 Producer   says, “Though it’s predominantly an Indian story, it has found an emotional connect everywhere. People feel like they are watching a real story and a real family. My son Shubhashish’s previous short film Kush (2013) also won rave reviews and awards. 'Mukti Bhawan' stemmed from his experiences at Banaras, something that deeply affected him. Our small film has been making India proud as it has been screened at over 50 international festivals so far. It has been shortlisted for the Asia Pacific awards (to be held in Brisbane, Australia) as well and won a standing ovation at  ! We hope it’s shortlisted for the Oscars as India’s official entry as well. Of course it’s up to the jury but we are hoping for the best.”
