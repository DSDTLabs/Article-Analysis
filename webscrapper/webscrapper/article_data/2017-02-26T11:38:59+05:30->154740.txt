PATNA: The Patna high court has temporarily stayed the probe into   districts. Hearing an LPA filed by one Jai Prakash Yadav on February 20, the court of acting Chief Justice Hemant Gupta on Wednesday stayed the probe that was being conducted by DIG (central range) Shalin. 

 P K Verma, who is the advocate of   in the LPA, said operations had been stayed for the time being and the original case would be converted into a PIL, which would be listed for hearing before a division bench. The original petition demanded a probe into illegal mining of sand. “The jurisdiction would now be changed from single bench to double bench,” Verma said. 
 
 The probe was ordered by Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah of the Patna high court on February 17 while hearing the petition filed by Sunil and others on October 14, 2015. Jai Prakash was one of the respondents in the case. The court had also asked Bihar DGP P K Thakur to provide a team to Shalin to carry out the investigation into the   at different river ghats in Patna and Bhojpur districts.
 
 Shalin had raided several ghats in Patna on Tuesday and in Bhojpur on Wednesday and, much to his surprise, found no one at even those ghats which had been licensed for sand mining. The probe team was given four weeks’ time to submit its report.
 
 Police sources said illegal sand mining is rampant in many parts of Bihar, including Patna and Bhojpur districts. It is to be noted that in January this year, over 700 trucks carrying illegally mined stone and sand were seized in different districts of Bihar.
