LUCKNOW:   had promised in its election manifesto to ban all   in state and now, with the party elected to power and Yogi Adityanath taking oath as chief minister, the fate of city’s first modernised   hangs in balance and officials are keeping their fingers crossed.

 Deputy CM of UP Dinesh Sharma, who spoke to TOI a couple of days back in the capacity of Mayor had said the choice to carry on with or shun the project depends entirely on the new government.   officials in charge of the project said the construction of slaughterhouse cannot be stopped in any circumstance as it was planned following instructions of the Supreme Court and only after approval of a state-level committee that included the mayor.
 
 “It was Samajwadi Party government’s project so municipal corporation was working in full swing on its construction and now it’s the new government that will decide whether the project continues or not,” said Sharma.
 
 On the contrary, the LMC official handling the project said, “In 2012, the apex court released guidelines following a PIL raised in 2003 that highlighted poor condition of the abattoirs run by municipal corporations and made it mandatory for all states to have mechanised slaughterhouses. For effective implementation of the guidelines, a 40-member state-level committee was formed including mayors, district magistrates, pollution board officials, municipal corporation’s veterinaries and directors of the local body. The work to construct a slaughterhouse in the city started after approval from this committee and since it is guided by Supreme Court the project cannot be stopped,” said the officials.
 
 Planned at a cost of Rs 90 crore at Bindaua, Mohanlalganj, the slaughterhouse would not only curb butchering meat in the city but will also provide a hygienic, systematic and automated process to process the meat. The project also included renovation and modernisation of LMC’s old slaughterhouse at Motijheel.
