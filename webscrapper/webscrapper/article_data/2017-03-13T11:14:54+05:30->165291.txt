 On January 30, 2015, 59-year-old Usha Naik and her 26-year-old daughter-in-law, Neha, were brutally murdered, allegedly by Usha’s second daughter-in-law Pratima, in connivance with her sister’s husband Abhijit Korgaonkar. 
 
 As per the chargesheet filed in the session court, “On that fateful day at Flat No 10 of   Society, Mangor Hill, accused Pratima Naik and Korgaonkar administered stupefying drugs to the deceased and thereafter Pratima committed the murder of Usha by strangulating her using a nylon rope in the presence of Abhijit. 
 
 She then smothered Neha with a pillow. Pratima then stole gold ornaments belonging to both deceased and their family members and handed them over to Korgaonkar for safekeeping”. 
 
 In the course of the trial, Korgaonkar turned approver.
