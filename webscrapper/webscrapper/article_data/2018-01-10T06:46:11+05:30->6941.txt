AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday directed the   to make all   which have been granted recognition from coming academic year, to keep 25% of seats vacant for free admissions of poor kids under provisions of the   Act.

 The HC directed that all the schools that are granted recognition, even after applications are invited for admissions under RTE provisions, should be subjected to the law and such newly recognized schools must offer 25% of their seats to poor kids. The high court has also made it clear that more and more students from underprivileged classes should be granted admission under the quota in various rounds of admission.
 
 This happened after a student, Sandip Munjyasara, filed a PIL after he found that newly recognized private schools had not granted admission to poor kids under RTE provisions last year. When the high court inquired, the state government said that applications for admission were invited in February 2017 and the schools were granted recognition in May/June.
 
 Munjyasara argued that 55,000 students were given admission last year, but more than 10,000 students did not get admission though there were seats available at newly recognized schools. On this, the HC said that this has resulted in a loss to the children of weaker and disadvantaged groups in securing admission in 2017-18.
