GUWAHATI:   who live in the   of the city have been   ever since the   (NFR) decided to remove   from land belonging to it. 

 The railway authorities have already sent eviction notices to hundreds of families living in Bamunimaidam, Bhaskar Nagar and the greater Pandu areas of the city and students could become the unforeseen target of the expulsion drive. The actual demolition of houses was supposed to begin on Friday but did not for some reason.
 
 "I feel this is the saddest time of my life. My father was brought up in this locality (Shitalabari) of Bamunimaidam. I am hurt that the railways slapped an eviction notice on us a few days ago. How can we vacate our house, that too only a few weeks ahead of my Class XII boards?" wondered Sahjad Sheikh, a student of Guwahati College.
 
 Sahjad has reason to worry as his family does not own land anywhere else. "My ancestors are from Bihar and my father works at a shop in the city. He educated us despite getting meagre wages. Today, I am very tense," said the dejected boy.
 
 For his junior, Akash, who will appear in the Class X state board exam, the situation is even graver. His family does not have enough money to rent a place so that he can take the exams in peace. "This is the harrowing time for us. The excavator can raze down my study corner any time. I don't have words to express my anguish," Akash said and urged the railway authorities to postpone the eviction drive.
 
 The NFR, on the other hand, stuck to its stand and reiterated that unauthorized settlers must vacate railway land. Railway officials said the drive to demolish unauthorized buildings could resume at any moment. 
 
 "The drive to clear railway land that has been occupied by families without any authority will happen," NFR's public relations officer Nripendra Bhattacharyya said.
