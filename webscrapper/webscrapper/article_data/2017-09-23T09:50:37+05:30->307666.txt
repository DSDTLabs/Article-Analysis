PATNA: State road construction minister   said on Friday that the   flyover would open for vehicular movement by Chhath festival and work on R-Block RoB would also resume within a week following changes in its design. 

 He also said Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Ltd (BRPNNL), from March 31 next year, would stop collecting toll tax on those bridges whose construction cost had been recovered. 
 
 Speaking on the sidelines of a review meeting on various schemes of BRPNNL, Nand Kishor said: “We wanted to complete the Mithapur RoB before Dussehra, but it is likely to take another month. Accordingly, I have asked BRPNNL to ready it before Chhath or latest by October 31.”
 
 Work on the Station Road flyover, which is a part of Mithapur RoB, commenced in November 2013 and it was initially scheduled to be completed by the end of December 2015, which was later revised to December last year. The deadline was again revised to June-end by former road construction Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. 
 
 The 854m-long flyover, to join the eastern flank of Chiraiyatand RoB with Mithapur RoB, is getting executed at the cost of Rs167.85 crore. The two ends of the flyover have already been connected to Chiraiyatand RoB and Mithapur RoB.
 
 The minister said S N Bhobe & Associates Pvt Ltd was blacklisted for making faulty design for the R-Block flyover, which is to connect Mithapur ROB with   over   via R-Block roundabout. Groundwork on this flyover started in March last year, but it was recently put on hold owing to faults in its design. 
 
 “The design for the flyover has been revised and vetted by IIT-Delhi. Accordingly, work will resume within a week,” he said and added that BRPNNL would install street lights on the flyovers constructed by it.
