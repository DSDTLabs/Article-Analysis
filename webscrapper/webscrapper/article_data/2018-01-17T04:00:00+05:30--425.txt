The MLA claimed that payment of Rs 800 crore of cotton insurance was pending for previous years. Chirag Kalaria of Jamjodhpur alleged, “The state-run power companies like PGVCL don’t provide electricity for eight hours. Moreover, their officers lodge false cases of electricity theft against farmers and victimize them for voting for Congress.” Lalit Vasoya said, “If government won’t solve farmers’ problem we will start our agitation from February 1 at the taluka level and organize a mass farmers rally in Upleta.” Tankara MLA Lalit Kagathra alleged, “Since last three days, government has closed down groundnut procurement centres for purchasing commodity at MSP.
