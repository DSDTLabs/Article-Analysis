MOHALI: Two groups of farmers came to blows following a difference of opinion during the draw of lots for plots in ECO City-1. It was conducted by Greater   Area Development Authority (GMADA) on Friday. The draw was postponed. 

 GMADA estate officer (housing) Puja Syal Grewal said, "The farmer groups were at loggerheads because of which the proceedings of draw of lots could not carry on. So we have postponed the draw till further orders. " Members of the Eco City Kisan Sangarsh Committee led by president Mohan   and general secretary   had an argument with   Singh and others over the postponing of the draw. Lal alleged that the committee had written a letter to GMADA praying that they must club the plots of those farmers who are to be allotted two or more plots.
 
 Paramjit and others were of the view that the draw must be carried out as the process was already delayed for the past three years.
