HYDERABAD:   was wrong about no jobs being provided by the government,   said.

 Speaking to the media on Saturday, Prabhakar said 32,000 jobs in the government were already filled in   in the last two and a half years.
 
 “Kodandaram is behaving like a Congress agent. He has a political agenda. He should not instigate youth against the government alleging that no jobs were being provided,“ Prabhakar said. In another press conference, SC corporation chairman   also criticised Kodandaram for misleading students and youth. “Many more   will be created and filled in the future. This is the commitment of the government,“ Ravi said.
