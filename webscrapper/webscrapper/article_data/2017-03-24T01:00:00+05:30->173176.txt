Actress   is shifting gears back to acting after a two-year hiatus. During the break, she focussed her energies on production along with a partner,  . 
Priyankka, who is still popular as Naina Singh Ahluwalia from ' ', says, “I wouldn’t have taken a break if money was a priority. So, rather than choosing something that didn’t excite me as an actor, I decided to get into production. I don’t think I have missed out on my prime years; it doesn’t hold true for an actor. The character has to click with the audience; it has no connection with the actor’s age. I want to take up roles that challenge me, I am instinctive while picking work.”
 Priyankka says that she doesn’t have any qualms playing mother to grown-ups if the role is substantial. “It should give me a scope to perform,” she asserts.
 On the personal front, it was rumoured that she was in a relationship with Zeishan. Ask her about it and she replies, “I am not single, but I don’t want to talk about it. I want to get married; after all, everybody seeks companionship. I just believe that it’s better to marry the right person and then talk about it rather than fuel the speculations around it. I am just waiting for the right time to be vocal about it.”
