NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday ordered a crackdown on   in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash-I and asked   to get its act together.   expressed unhappiness that vehicles continued to be parked haphazardly on   in the colony despite clear-cut orders by court.

 “What is visible is that you have not done your job,” a bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar remarked, while hearing a petition seeking removal of commercial establishments from the area.
 
 HC’s direction came after the petitioner submitted photographs of the area, showing cars parked on pavements and roads by people visiting banks and other establishments, making it impossible for residents to use the footpath.
 
 The bench asked traffic police to deploy its personnel and take action against cars parked unauthorisedly. “Show the will to do it. Do whatever it takes, but don’t permit anyone to park there from tomorrow,” the bench said. The police earlier told the court that they were taking action periodically against illegally parked vehicles by towing them away and challaning the owners.
 
 The bench told the traffic police that results would be visible if strict action was being taken. It recalled how the same traffic police cleared vehicular congestion from Anand Vihar area within two days following court's direction on a PIL related to air pollution in the city.
 
 The court will now take stock of the situation on April 19.
