BENGALURU: There is a strong prima facie case against senior BJP leader R Ashoka in  ,   ( ) has told the high court.

 ACB said Ashoka, as chairman of the Bengaluru south taluk bagar hukum land regularization committee (between 1998-2006), was responsible for grant of land to ineligible beneficiaries, including those who did not even submit applications and a couple who stayed together but submitted separate applications.
 
  The agency has prayed the court not to grant any stay on the investigation and said if any interim order is granted, Ashoka may win over witnesses and also destroy evidence. As regards to another accused B Karthik, the agency claimed that he was just three years old in 1987 when he claimed to have been in possession of the land. The law, however, stipulates that he/she should have completed 18 years or above for being eligible to apply under bagar hukum scheme, the agency pointed out.
 
 Justice R B Budihal posted the matter to Wednesday for consideration of interim prayer. In his petition, Ashoka has claimed that the registration of FIR is a politically motivated action just before the assembly elections. tnn
