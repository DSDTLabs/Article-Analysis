With Tamil Nadu in a political imbroglio, there were certain reports that stated that   Rajinikanth was all set to take the plunge into   and that he might even float his own political party. While another section reported that his dear friend and Bollywood Shehanshah   had requested him not to enter politics for now. 

 But, now we hear that the plans to float his own political party is only a rumour and that there are no plans as such. Superstar has a cordial relationship with the   and speculations are rife that the party is keen to rope in the actor to seek help in establishing themselves in the Dravidian land. However, we will have to wait for an official confirmation from the actor in this regard.
