CHENNAI: Revoking a temporary relief granted to   (Amma) deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, the Madras high court on Monday vacated the stay on the proceedings against him in a   Regulations Act ( ) case pending in a special court here. 

 Justice M S Ramesh also set aside the charges framed against Dhinakaran by the special court on April 19 and directed the trial court to re-do the process after granting adequate time to the accused to submit his objections and to complete the trial within three months. 
 
 The judge passed the order on a plea moved by Dhinakaran assailing the charges framed by the special court on the grounds that the trial judge had failed to provide adequate opportunity for his counsel to make his submissions before framing the charges.
 
 Opposing the plea, the ED stated that the petitioner had been protracting the proceedings from 1996 onwards. The petitioner was given sufficient opportunity by the magistrate for arguments which he did not avail of and hence the present petition deserves to be dismissed.
 
 To this, the petitioner said the delay in the proceedings was also attributable to the prosecution since between the period from August 12, 1996 when the chief examination commenced and till April 12, 2017, the prosecution has examined only seven witnesses.
 
 Recording the submissions, the judge said, “The charges framed on April 19 by the additional chief metropolitan magistrate is set aside. The petitioner is permitted to put forth his arguments on the charges framed in the said case. Such an exercise shall be completed within one working day and such date shall be fixed by the magistrate on or before July 31. It is made clear that I have not expressed any of my views with regard to the merits of the petitioner’s case and it is open to the magistrate to frame charges against the petitioner, if such arguments are not advanced on the stipulated date.”
