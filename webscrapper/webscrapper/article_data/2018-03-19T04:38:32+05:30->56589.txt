NEW DELHI: Sending out the strongest signal yet to the old guard that they will eventually have to make way for the youth,   president   said the party could only be changed by demolishing “the wall” between workers and leaders — calling it his “first job” at the top.

 
 Although he “sugarcoated” the messages by saying he he would “bring down the wall, not by anger but with love, and by showing respect to veterans”, the intent to phase out the old guard could not have escaped the veterans seated in the front rows. With workers at the plenary session screaming hoarse at his statement of intent,   added there existed a “second wall” between youth and the  .
 
 After repeated assurances to the jittery old guard over the last two years in the run-up to his ascension and an olive branch in his first speech at the   on Saturday, Rahul made organisational reform, with infusion of youth and better treatment of workers, the centrepiece of his address on Sunday which brought down the curtain on the two-day conclave.
 
 The Gandhi scion said “the wall” manifested itself in organisational malaises like election nominations to “aspirants who parachute from above” and in denial of tickets to those who lacked financial muscle.
