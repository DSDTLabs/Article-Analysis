SHIMLA: Tension erupted in   town of the Shimla district when members of Dev Sanskriti Raksha Manch raised objection to a religious congregation by a minority community in the auditorium of Boys Senior Secondary School. They alleged of conversion under the garb of the meeting. They also blocked the national highway-5 for over an hour. Normalcy returned after the local administration cancelled the permission granted for the congregation. 

 According to sources the local unit of a minority community was scheduled to hold a two-day religious congregation on Sunday and Monday. Even chief minister   was supposed to attend the it on Monday but his programme was cancelled on Saturday.
 
 Sources said that on Sunday morning, members of Dev Sanskriti Raksha Manch and others assembled outside the school and charged the organizers with alleged conversion, which the latter denied and decided to carry on. They argued if Sri Sri Ravi Shankar could participate in a programme in the school, so could they.
 
 Heated arguments ensued between the two sides and the local administration along with heavy police force rushed to the spot to thwart any untoward incident. Even the priest from the US who was to address the religious congregation was not allowed to step out of his hotel, sources said.
 
 Rampur, SDM,   said that around 12, he was informed about the protest outside the school. After reaching the spot, he found them blocking the national highway. The principal of the school apprised him of the cancellation of the programme. 
 
 Jindal also said a meeting was held with members of both the organizations and it was decided that the function would not be held. The situation was diffused around 3.15 pm but there is still police deployment in the town.
