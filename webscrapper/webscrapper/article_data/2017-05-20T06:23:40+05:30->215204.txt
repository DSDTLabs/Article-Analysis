 According to the government's anniversary programmes, the inauguration of the Metro was schedule for May 30 at 5 at Aluva.
 
 As the minister's statement snowballed into a con troversy, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan stepped in.
 
 “We are in constant touch with the   for his date and for an official confirmation.But so far no confirmation has been received. The state will decide the date once we get the confirmation,“ the chief minister said in Kannur.
