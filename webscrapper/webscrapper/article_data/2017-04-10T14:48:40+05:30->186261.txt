NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister 
  today likened the   to the Mahabharat's   character, saying the supposedly impartial election regulator is doing everything it can to get "its son" the   to win, by turning a blind eye to faulty voting machines.

 "Election Commission has become Dhritarashtra, who is trying to win his son BJP at any cost," said Kejriwal.
  
  
 As evidence of this, the Delhi CM implied that the EC was merely replacing 
  (EVM) instead of investigating them. "In such a circumstance, why are elections being held at all," he asked.
  
  
 He further said that the EVMs aren't exactly "defective", they have been 
  .
 
 
  If there were a defect, then some machines would have voted for the Congress and other opposition parties, Kejriwal reasoned.
 
 "It means this is not a malfunction but the software of these machines have been tampered with or has been completely changed."
 
 Kejriwal also alleged that even though EVMs are available in the Capital, they are being brought from Rajasthan for the April 23 Delhi municipal polls are being brought from Rajasthan although many EVMs were available in Delhi. "In such a scenario, would elections be fair?" he asked.
  
  
 The AAP chief alleged that 18 machines in Rajasthan voted only for the BJP - in yesterday's Dholpur bypoll - no matter which button was pressed by the voters. He also made reference to an earlier allegedly tampered EVM in Bhind in  .
