NEW DELHI: Right from the moment the feud between   and his girlfriend   and   and his wife   was explored by the WWE, it was surely a bygone conclusion on how the feud will end. 

 With John Cena out of the title picture for   and The Miz dropping his Intercontinental Championship to Dean Ambrose, the duo heading in to a one-on-one match up at the show of all shows would have been pointless. 
 
 While Maryse had been playing the manager’s role with aplomb, she needed a worthy adversary. The angle with Renee Young and Dean Ambrose was teased, but Nikki Bella would have got the Company more leverage. 
 
 But more than the build-up to the mixed tag match at Wrestlemania 33, everyone who had been following WWE and Total Bellas knew that the story here had to be about Cena finally popping the big question to Nikki. 
 
  
  
 
 With Nikki’s sister, Brie Bella, already on the road to Motherhood and retired from wrestling, Nikki’s career too had to be heading in somewhat similar direction. And that was confirmed on Monday after the duo’s mixed tag match when Cena went down on one knee in the middle of the ring at the Citrus Bowl Arena in Orlando, Florida in front of over 75,000-strong crowd and proposed to Nikki. 
 
 ‘The Fearless One’ was overwhelmed when Cena said that he was waiting for this moment for a long time. The usual jeers and boos that is now associated with the 16-time World champion, turned in to cheers. Nikki didn’t hesitate to accept the proposal and the duo sealed it with a kiss.
