BHOPAL:  , a community of more than 20,000 members, left the food-lovers of   licking their fingers with the exquisite cuisines offered to them during their first food festival.

 While all of us live with a notion that pursuing our dreams alongside our career is not possible, a group of four food lovers made it possible by, first, making a group by themselves, which then expanded to a large community in a very short time. 
 
 Danish Siddiqui a digital marketing expert, Nida Siddiqui, a dentist, Anoop Jaiswal, an event manager and Rishiraj Sigh, a lawyer founded 'Bhopal Foodies' when they realized they had an unparalleled love for food and wished to include more cuisine-connoisseurs in their collection of recipes. 
 
 Singh, a founder and member said, "Our passion for food led us to form the group. Later, we thought why not include other food lovers who wish to explore different cuisines and love eating out. Slowly and gradually, the community grew and here we are- organizing this food festival."
 
 Explaining about the initiative, he added, "All the food festivals that we saw before this did not have a food curation. We made it a point not to repeat dishes. So if there is one stall for Italian cuisine, it is the best one in town. Foodies can enjoy a vast variety of delicacies - bakery products, herbal teas along with Mexican, Italian, Punjabi, Marathi and Andhra cuisine"
 
 With a footfall of 5,000 people on day one, the group is planning to organize more such events along with cookery classes, food walks and other activities for foodies of the city.
