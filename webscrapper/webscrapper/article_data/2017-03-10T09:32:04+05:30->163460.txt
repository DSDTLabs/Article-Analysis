VADODARA : After nearly 30 years, 110 members of a housing society in Nizampura, will receive Rs 5.30 lakh along with nine per cent interest for all these years from a builder and architect who had taken excess amount from them for a construction project.

 The judicial magistrate’s court has ordered the builder Chandrakant   and architect P S Rajan to repay the excess money. 
 
 Employees of a state-government undertaking had given a piece of land in Nizampura that they jointly owned to a Patel to build apartments for them in April 1980. According to the agreement signed between the builder and housing society, Patel was supposed to finish the construction without enhancing the cost of construction.
 
 In 1983, both, Patel and the housing society members again agreed to enhance the construction cost but with a condition that the construction work should end in eight months. However, that did not happen and in 1987 the office-bearers gave a cheque of Rs 39.51 lakh after the architect gave them the bill amount verbally.
 
 When the physical copies of the bill was given, the society learnt that the builder, in collusion with Rajan had taken Rs 5.30 lakh in excess from them.
 
 The society then moved the court and prayed for Rs 24.61 lakh along with 18 per cent interest per annum. Since Patel builder had not finished the construction within eight months, they had also asked for repayment of excess money he took as per the enhanced rates.
 
 Society’s lawyer DN Parikh told TOI that he had presented in the court the original bill and the copy of cheque that was given to Patel by the society’s office-bearers as prime evidence. 
 
 The court of judicial magistrate D R Joshi relied on the evidence given by the plaintiff and ordered Patel and Rajan to pay the excess amount of Rs 5.30 lakh along with nine per cent from the date of filing of case till the date of judgement.
