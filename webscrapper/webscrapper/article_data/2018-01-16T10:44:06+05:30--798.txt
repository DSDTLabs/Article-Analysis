SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has suspended the license of two city-based private engineers for negligence in construction of a property in  , which resulted in damage to a neighbouring building that started leaning on one side on January 13.

 Those whose licenses were suspended are   and structural engineer H H Christian. 
 
 An official from the central zone said they had to vacate nearly eight other homes due to the fear of property structure falling off the base . 
 
 According to case details, a citizen Amrut Joshi had got the development plan approved for the property sized 16x40 feet at   on January 4, 2016. However, he didn’t start construction then, but started digging up the base two years later without informing the SMC officials. 
 
 “While digging the foundation, they didn’t take care about the neighbouring 40-year-old four-storey property. They dug up the footing much below the old property footing and as a result foundation of the old building was shaken and it tilted on one side. It could have collapsed,” zonal chief of central zone   said. 
 
 The old house is an RCC structure built and is owned by Paresh Kayasth and his family. After putting up proper support, SMC has started demolishing it slowly.
