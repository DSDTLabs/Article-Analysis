PATNA: A   team on Tuesday quizzed former CM   at her 10, Circular Road residence in the money laundering case lodged on April 7 last year against Arshad Ahmed, the son of former   MLC Anwar Ahmed, and the employees of Bihar Awami Cooperative Bank.

 
 Anwar is the bank’s chairman while Arshad is its director. Anwar is considered close to RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
 
 CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said Rabri had deposited Rs10 lakh in one of her accounts with the bank’s Muradpur branch in Patna after demonetisation announced on November 8, 2016. “The quizzing was part of the ongoing investigation in the case,” Gaur said.
 
 CBI sources said Rabri was quizzed about the source of money deposited in the bank account.
 
 CBI’s anti-corruption branch in Patna had lodged the FIR against Arshad, who is also the director of Mother’s International Academy, cashiers   and  , acting branch manger Kaushalendra Kumar Sharma and some unknown persons. Abhay was posted at Muradpur branch, Prakash at Patna City branch and Kaushalendra at Raza Bazar branch of the bank.
 
 Raids were conducted on these branches a day after lodging of the FIR. Before the CBI raids, Income Tax department had also conducted raids on January 13, 2017 on different locations of Arshad before handing over the case to the CBI.
