 Residents said they have been following up the issue with the authorities for a couple of weeks. “We first submitted a complaint to MCG. A team of MCG officials visited the site and agreed that norms are being violated, but expressed helplessness, saying that the area doesn’t come under its jurisdiction. We also approached Huda, but it also gave the same response. Finally, DTCP inspected the site and sent a notice to the owner,” said one of the complainants, requesting anonymity. 
 
 “As the site is located so close to a school, it has become a potential source of air pollution. Children find it very difficult to go via the area. Also, there is a 30-ft deep pit on a road right in front of the school, which poses safety threat to children and residents,” said  , a resident of Suncity, a township in Sector 54.
