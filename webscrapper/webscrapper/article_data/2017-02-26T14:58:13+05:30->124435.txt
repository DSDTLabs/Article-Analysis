'I'm a big fan of Allu Arjun, so coming back to Tollywood to work with him is something I'm very kicked about. He's a very sweet person and there's so much to learn from him. I'm really looking forward to it,' says the former Miss India finalist. When asked about her role, Pooja says, 'My character will be totally different from what I did in my Telugu debut film  . In Oka... I played a traditional Telugu ammayi who wore salwar-kurta. but DJ will show me as a modern girl, who's uber glamourous. It's going to be a fun film.'

 Reflecting on her big ticket Bollywood debut which tanked at the BO, Pooja says, she has 'no regrets.' 'The film had everything I could have asked for ' a superstar like   and a filmmaker like Ashutosh Gowariker. So, it was a massive debut. It was a learning experience and offers have been coming my way since then.'
