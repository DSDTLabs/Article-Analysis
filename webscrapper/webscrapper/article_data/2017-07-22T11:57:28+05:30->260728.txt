VADODARA: A group of students of general education building of M S University’s ( ) commerce faculty held protests for lack of cleanliness and want of amenities.

 The students said that the general education building has water cooler for them but as it has not been cleaned since long time, the water in it stinks. The water tank from which the cooler gets water has also not been cleaned and has algae deposited in it.
 
 “The students had made request to the authorities in the past to get the tank and water cooler cleaned but it fell on deaf ears,” said Priyanka Patel, former vice president of MSU Students’ Union, who joined the protests with the students.
 
 Some students also said that there is lack of cleanliness around the toilets for students which raises severe stink. The students group submitted a memorandum to the Jayant Kumar, co-ordinator of general education building, demanding for quick action.
 
 The students, who are paying Rs 5,000 more as fees than the students studying at faculty’s main building, told Kumar that if their requests are not met, they will resume agitation.
