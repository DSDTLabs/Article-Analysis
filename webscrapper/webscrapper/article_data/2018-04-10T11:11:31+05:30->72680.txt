PUNE: Parents of students studying at   in Magarpatta protested against the school authorities on Monday over   against their wards. 

 The parents, who had earlier protested against the fee hike by the school, said their children were made to sit separately and not issued permanent identity cards. 
 
 School principal Meera Nair said the allegations were false and on day one of the new academic year it was not possible to issue permanent IDs. The school opened for new academic year on Monday. 
 
 Parents claimed the school had hiked the fees illegally. A parent said, "We have asked the school to retain the fee structure of the previous year. Some parents paid fees as per the previous year. So, parents who did not pay their fees in full, their wards were made to sit separately and were also issued temporary IDs. It is unjust."
 
 The parents said they received an e-mail from school stating that the fees should be paid by April 13. After the school got over on Monday, some parents realised that their children were discriminated against. 
 
 Parents then contacted the helpline number 1098 and a member of childline Savita Divate reached the school. Divate, said, "We tried to solve the issue between the parents and the school but received little response from the school. I had to meet the principal to understand the issue who denied any discrimination against the students. We have told parents to furnish documents about fee hike to study the issue."
 
 Nair said, "All allegations made by the parents are false. There has not been any fee hike this year. Also, on day one of the school, it is impossible to issue permanent IDs. We have issued temporary cards to all students. We met a member of the child rights and explained to her our side and she was convinced with what we had to say."
