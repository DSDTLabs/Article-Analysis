Mumbai:   leader   (India) has dropped prices on   and   by 8-9% following tax reductions in the new   regime. The move by Colgate-Palmolive, which has a market share of around 56% in toothpastes, is expected to trigger price cuts by other players as well. Post-GST, the tax rate on toothpastes has come down from around 24% to 18%.

 “GST has enabled Colgate-Palmolive (India) to extend to its consumers the benefits of reduction in MRPs by 8 to 9%, for the key categories of toothpastes and toothbrushes. The revised prices are effective for all shipments starting July 1 and we are working together with our partners in our demand and supply chain to facilitate an orderly transition. The implementation of GST will greatly enhance the ease of doing business in the country,” a Colgate-Palmolive (India) spokesperson said in response to TOI’s query.
 
  (100 gm), which was earlier costing the consumer Rs 52, has now been priced at Rs 46. Similarly, on  , the maximum retail price (MRP) has been dropped from Rs 65 to Rs 60.
 
 A few days back,   passed on GST benefits to consumers on select soap and laundry products. ITC, too, has announced consumer promotions on its   and bar range, Savlon soap, Vivel soap and Superia, offering discounts of up to 30-35%. Some FMCG companies are understood to be destocking in trade over the last ten days amid confusion regarding GST rules. An Edelweiss Research report said companies with high proportion of wholesale trade will be impacted more as channel checks indicate that quite a few wholesalers have still not registered under GST.
 
 In the case of Colgate-Palmolive, which has a higher dependence on the wholesale channel, the Edelweiss Research said it expects volumes to decline by around 7-8%, year on year, in the first quarter of the current fiscal, primarily owing to destocking at the wholesaler level.
