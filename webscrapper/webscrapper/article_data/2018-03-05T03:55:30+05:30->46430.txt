MUMBAI: Fourteen students from various south Mumbai schools were part of a team that set a Guinness World record for the longest   on skates in Belgaum, Karnataka. The students were felicitated by actor Bhagyashree at Mahapragya Public School, Kalbadevi for the feat accomplished in October 2017. They were part of a 394-member team. 

 The students, trained by coach Dhwanit Rele, had to skate in groups of six for half an hour, then dunk a cookie in milk and eat it before tapping the next group to do the same. The group from Mumbai participated for approximately six hours during the 24-hour relay. 
 
 Among the participating schools were Mahapragya Public School, St Mary's School (ICSE), St Xavier's School, BD Somani International School and GD Somani Memorial School, Shakuntala KI Jain High School and St Teresa School. TNN
