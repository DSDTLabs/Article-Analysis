CHENNAI: The   government on Monday appointed retired Madras high court judge   to probe the death of former chief minister J  .

 “A government order has been issued to set up an inquiry commission headed by retired judge of the high court Justice Arumughaswamy to probe Jayalalithaa’s death and submit a report,” a brief statement from the information department.
 
 
 
 The order came a month after chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced that his government would set up an inquiry panel headed by a retired judge to probe into the circumstances leading to the demise of Jayalalithaa. “There are several reports in the media from various organisations and sections,” Palaniswami had said, on the need to conduct an inquiry into the death.
 
 Justice Arumughaswamy was appointed on a day when TTV   – the sidelined AIADMK leader and nephew of V K   -- revealed to the media that Sasikala had shot a video of ailing Jayalalithaa in the hospital, on the latter’s insistence over her weight loss. “Sasikala has given permission to me to submit the footage to an inquiry committee set up for the purpose,” Dhinakaran told reporters.
