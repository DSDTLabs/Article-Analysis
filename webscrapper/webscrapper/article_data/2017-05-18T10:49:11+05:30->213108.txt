 The Centre's think tank, the Niti Aayog, and the department of pharmaceuticals ( ) have already started deliberations in this direction. The policy will replace the existing  , 2012 - which forms the core of the Drugs Price Control Order, 2013 and hence drives prices of all essential medicines as well as many other pharmaceutical products including stents and medical devices.
 
 While the DoP has already started consultation with various stakeholders including pharmaceutical companies and civil society organisations, the Aayog held the first inter-ministerial meeting on the issue on Monday. Representatives from regulatory bodies such as the Drugs Controller General of India and chairman of the   were also present.
 
 Apart from revamping the existing policy, the Centre is also moving to introduce changes to the Drug Price Control Order, 2013. 
 
 According to officials present in the meeting, the DoP suggested balancing the new policy by taking care of the interest of the industry as well as consumers. However, officials and regulators also highlighted existing price anomalies. While the current policy is also up for review next year after completion of five years, the new one may change the pricing regime.
 
 Meanwhile, civil society organisations have raised objections to the deliberations since a case is pending in the Supreme Court contesting the market-based mechanism adopted by the policy to fix drug prices.
