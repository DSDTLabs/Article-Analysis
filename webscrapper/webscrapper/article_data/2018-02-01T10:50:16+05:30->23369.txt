NEW DELHI:   on Thursday released a Doodle to celebrate the life and work of poet and author  .

 
 The release of the Doodle coincided with the anniversary of the publication of her autobiography ' ', which was originally published in 1976.
 
 'My Story', in which she described her life from childhood to marriage, and beyond, was considered controversial in some quarters. But Das' readers "were enchanted by the lyricism and honesty of her writing."
 
 While Das originally wrote her autobiography in English, she translated it to Malayalam along the way.
 
 Born on March 31, 1934, in Kerala's Punnayurkulam, Das spent her childhood in Kolkata, where her father VM Nair was employed.
 
 Her father was a former managing editor of Mathrubhoomi, while her mother Nalapat Balamani Amma was a renowned Malayali poet, reported ANI.
 
 When Das first began publishing, she used the pseudonym Madhavikutty.
 
 Google remarked on the "boldness" and "shapeshifting quality" of her work, noting that she was "determined to live life on her own terms."
 
 "She wrote of love, loss and longing in her measured, yet fiery voice," it added.
 
 Das' extensive contribution to Indian poetry earned her the epithet 'The Mother of Modern Indian English Poetry'. She was a recipient of the Sahitya Academy Award in 1984.
 
 The Doodle by artist Manjit Thapp,   said, "celebrates the work she left behind, which provides a window into the world of an engrossing woman."
