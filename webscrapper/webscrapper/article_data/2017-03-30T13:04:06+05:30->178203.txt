  "For the most part, this is like a high school reunion but much worse because they all still look really great. I was hoping some of them would puff out a bit. But that did not take place," the show's director says.

  Alyson Hannigan says "It was the role of a lifetime. I met the love of my life (Alexis Denisof, Wesley in the show). And just to get to go to work every day and have Joss sort of train me - I'll never have a better experience than that."
