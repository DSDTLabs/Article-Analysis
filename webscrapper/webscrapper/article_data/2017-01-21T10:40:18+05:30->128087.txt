 The   has decided to click pictures of the accused or suspects inside the police stations and store them in their records. The person who is arrested will be taken to a room in the police station where his picture will be clicked with a professional camera. 
 
 “Earlier we used to take the accused or suspects to private photo studios where their pictures were clicked. But it was a waste of time and energy as a team of cops had to take the accused to the studio and it was a security risk too. So we decided to set up a mini photo lab in all the police stations,” said city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar. 
 
 All police stations barring four have already been given the cameras along with tripods. 
 
 The state government had already given cameras to the police department but they were not being used earlier. “The camera is set in a position with the photo settings in a manner in which it grabs the face of the accused. The photos are then stored in the computer directly. We have also decided to take finger prints of the accused on the scanners available at the police stations.
