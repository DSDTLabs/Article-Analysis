In one of its largest single-day slides ever, index heavyweight   plunged 12.6% on Tuesday, wiping out about Rs 50,000 crore or $7.7 billion from its market capitalisation (m-cap). The crash in the cigarettes-to-biscuits major sent the benchmark sensex tumbling to its steepest daily fall so far in 2017. The ITC stock price had crashed due to the GST Council’s decision on Monday evening to increase cess on  .

 In 2017, ITC was the biggest sensex driver, contributing about 21% to the benchmark’s rally. By close of Tuesday’s trade, the sensex was down 1.1%, or 364 points, at 31,711, while the broader   on the   was down 0.9%, or 89 points, at 9,827. The BSE’s FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) index, which includes ITC — the best performer in the current market rally — also cracked and closed 6.1% lower. 
 
 On Monday evening, the   hiked the compensation cess on filter and non-filter cigarettes with effect from the midnight of July 17. The government indicated that the GST rates announced earlier led to a windfall of about Rs 5,000 crore for cigarette companies, resulting in a unanimous decision to revere the same. The government’s decision also prompted several top brokerages to downgrade the ITC stock. These included foreign broking major  , which cut its target price drastically to Rs 285 from Rs 417 earlier. Among others, Credit Suisse downgraded ITC to neutral rating and cut the price target to Rs 310 from Rs 400 earlier, while   cut the price target to Rs 285.
 
 Analysts at HSBC said given the high incidence of tax, it is unlikely ITC will be able to replicate its 15% growth momentum seen last decade. However, analysts at Macquarie maintained their outperform rating on the stock with a price target at Rs 340.
 
 The day’s session also saw Reliance, another sensex heavyweight, witness heavy selling on the back of a government-imposed penalty for explorations-related issues. The stock closed over 2% down. Along with ITC, Reliance was also one of the prime drivers of the recent rally.
