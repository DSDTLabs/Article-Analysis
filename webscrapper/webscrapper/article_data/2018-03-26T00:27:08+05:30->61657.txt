Madurai: The Madurai City Corporation will be holding special camps to enumerate sanitary workers who were involved in manual scavenging as part of their rehabilitation. According to a statement from the civic body, the special camps will be conducted as per the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, to identify workers involved in manually cleaning septic tanks, open drains, open defecation areas and insanitary latrines.

 The workers have been asked to bring passport size photographs, aadhar card, original bank passbook, election identity card and family ration card for the registration process.
 
 The first camp will be held at Sathamangalam sanitary office/urban primary healthcare centre on March 27 and April 3 between 10am and 5pm. The second camp will be held at K Pudur sanitary office/urban primary healthcare centre on April 3 and 4 from 10am to5 pm and third camp will be held at the 24-hours maternity hospital/sanitary office near Corporation zonal-1 office on April 5 from 10am to 5pm.
 
 Corporation sources said that the rehabilitation camps will be conducted as per the orders of the district administration. The rehabilitation will be of psychological, medial and occupational rehabilitation because manual scavenging is associated with a social stigma. 
 
 “After manual scavenging was banned by the court and the process switched to mechanized mode, the workers lost their livelihood and had to be provided with alternate employment,” a health official said.
