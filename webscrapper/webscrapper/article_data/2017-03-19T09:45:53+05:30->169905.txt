PANAJI: Goa stayed in the hunt for a place in the semifinals despite a hopelessly poor performance against Punjab in a Group 'A'   clash at GMC Athletic Stadium, Bambolim, on Saturday.

 Goa could only manage a 1-1 draw against Chandigarh in a crucial third-round encounter but  's unexpected 2-0 victory over de fending champions   allowed the hosts some breathing space. Goa have five points and will need a draw against Services in the concluding league clash.
 
 Chandigarh are out of the reckoning with four points while leaders Bengal are the only side to have sealed their place in the knockout stage. Meghalaya and Services will have to keep their fingers crossed as they are not guaranteed of a place in the semi-finals, even if they win their last league clash.
 
 How Goa would have loved to have qualification sealed with a match in hand. They could, or rather should, have done that without breaking into sweat but an uncharacteristic performance from the entire squad means Goa have to raise the bar against defending champions Services.
