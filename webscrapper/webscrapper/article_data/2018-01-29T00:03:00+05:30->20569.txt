Santoshkumar.B Bengaluru: On January 20, an unusual drama played out on New BEL Road in upscale Sadashivnagar. The story ended with cops arresting a cop and his gang for attempting to abduct a drug dealer and extorting money. Constables Krishnappa and Ashwath Reddy from Sadashivnagar police station nabbed Babu S, 45, a head constable with Karnataka State Intelligence. The two night beat cops were on their rounds when around 10.30pm they spotted three people beating a man near an auto parking area close to the Ayyappa Swamy Temple. They found that Mohammed Nousheen, 22, a drug dealer, was being blackmailed by the gang and now thrashed because he couldn’t pay the gang. Nousheen said four people claiming to be policemen had barged into his paying guest accommodation in Lottegollahalli around 9.30pm and found ganja in the cupboard. Later, one showed him a police identity card and told him it was a police raid. The gang led by Babu demanded Rs 3 lakh in fine and threatened to file a case if he didn’t pay up. After negotiations, they agreed not to file the case if Nousheen paid them Rs 40,000. “Nousheen alleged that the gang took Rs 15,000 and his iPhone and threatened him to pay Rs 25,000 more. He convinced them to take him to Malleswaram to arrange the money,” one source said.  Police have since arrested Babu, a resident of the Indiranagar police quarters, and S Poova, 42, from Gauthampura; Gopinath S, 25, from Dheenabandhu Nagar and Selvam V, 45, from Lakshmipura. They seized an autorickshaw used to abduct Nousheen and recovered 80gms of ganja seized from him. Nousheen told the gang he would borrow money from a friends in Malleswaram. But the gang grew suspicious and began assaulting him. “That’s when the two constables saw the gang and called for reinforcements,” another source said. Inspector V Naveen Supekar rushed to the scene and they nabbed the gang. They also arrested Nousheen and his associates for peddling drugs.
