AGARTALA: The youth wing of the Indigenous People's Front of   (IPFT) and the All Tripura Indigenous Students' Association (ATISA) on Monday demanded a high-level inquiry into the suicide of a Class XII girl at the Barkathal area of Mohanpur in West Tripura. 

 The organizations alleged that the girl, a student at a convent school here, had been subjected to abuse at her school after false allegations of theft were levelled against her. Report said the girl went to a hypermarket along with friends to buy a gift for a teacher's farewell. The guard had reportedly allowed her to carry an additional bag with mandatory tagging while entering the store. When coming out, she was caught by the guard at the exit and accused of stealing. 
 
 "I tried to convince the guard that I will take about three hours to travel from my village and that she should not be abused or sent to police. I would be there soon and, if required, I will pay the full amount. But they hurled abuses and threatened to hand her over to police in an hour. Left with no option, I called up her sister to go and get her, which she did," her mother alleged.
 
 The girl was subsequently expelled from the hostel. 
 
 Her mother said, "I was also treated badly and abused in front of a large number of her friends in the hostel. She was removed from the hostel and we came back home. But since then, she was deeply disturbed by the false allegations. The following day, early in the morning we found her body."
 
 She was found hanging in her kitchen Friday morning. The family recovered a suicide note, which reportedly indicated that he had to commit suicide because of the slur of theft by the hypermarket authorities and her expulsion from the school's hostel.
 
 "Five days have passed police did not take any action and the family is not getting any assurance of justice. We want to ensure high-level inquiry into the case, not by police," the organizations stated.
