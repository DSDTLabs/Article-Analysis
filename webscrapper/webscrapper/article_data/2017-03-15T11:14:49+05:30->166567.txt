BHOPAL: In about six months,   will use treated water from Bhopal Sahkari Dugdh Sangh to wash platforms and trains. This comes after railway authorities on Tuesday approved the order of   (NGT) Central Bench to utilise the waste water from the Dugdh Sangh for washing purposes at   station.

 The Indian Railway Station Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) on Tuesday decided to lay the pipeline and start work as soon as possible. “The railways has agreed to NGT’s order. They have sought six months’ time for the project,” said advocate Om Shrivastava.
 
 The order came in November 2016, after one Shailendra Kumar Modi filed a petition seeking clarifications on the waste water being discharged by the Dugdh Sangh while alleging violation of environmental norms. Now, the treated water will be used for washing coaches and platforms.
 
 “This move will reduce the consumption of fresh water by the Railways and at the same time mitigate the expense incurred by the Dugdh Sangh in treatment of water. Moreover, utilisation of the treated water will go a long way in preserving the scarce resource,” NGT had said in its order.
 
 Habibganj railway station will now use 2 lakh litres of treated water per day from the Dugdh Sangh which operates within two kilometres of the railway station. 
 
 Drinking water will be supplied from fresh water supply of Kolar pipeline connection provided by Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC).   gets about 11 lakh litre of fresh water daily from BMC.
 
 NGT had also suggested BMC to decrease fresh water supply to railways by two lakh litres per day to tide over water scarcity in areas around Bhopal.
