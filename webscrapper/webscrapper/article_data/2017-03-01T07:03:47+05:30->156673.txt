 P S Raman, senior counsel for the association, said the authorities had misread the high court's order. Citing the Second Master Plan, he said it had suggested different parking requirements for different restaurants based on the size and category of the restaurants.
 
 The master plan requires parking space proportionate to floor area and not based on number of tablesseating capacity, he said, but the authorities misunderstood the court order and issued notices even to small eateries of 500sqft or less.
