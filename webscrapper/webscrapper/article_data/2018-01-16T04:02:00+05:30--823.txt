MUMBAI: Even as municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta in November last year, cleared the rooftop restaurants policy making use of his administrative powers, the norms may come up before the BMC House for a discussion this month. 

 Considering the December 29 blaze that gutted two rooftop restaurants at Kamala Mills compound killing 14 people, opposition parties have decided to raise questions over why there was haste in getting the policy cleared before it could come before the civic House.
 
 In February 2015, the BJP-led civic improvements committee voted against the rooftop restaurants policy with the party terming it as being ‘against Indian culture’. The policy was in May 2015 sent before the BMC House for corporators to take a call on the same. However, since then as no decision was taken on the policy, in November 2017, Mehta cleared it under Section 36 (2) of the   (MMC) Act, 1888. Under this provision, if any proposal is not cleared by the civic House within 90 days after which the proposal was received by the municipal secretary it can then be considered as “deemed passed”. Samajwadi Party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh blamed the ruling Shiv Sena for not bringing up the policy on time for a discussion.
 
 Leader of the opposition in the BMC Ravi Raja said that his party is going to demand answers from the civic   as to why there was haste in getting the proposal “deemed passed” in the civic House. “There should have been a discussion on the policy in the BMC House as it would have brought given more perspective. However, the commissioner went ahead and got the policy passed and now we have this massive blaze in two rooftop eateries that have killed 14 people. Who should be held responsible for it now?” asked Raja. Sources said that it is likely that the municipal commissioner may demand that the policy be taken out from the agenda as it has already been passed.
