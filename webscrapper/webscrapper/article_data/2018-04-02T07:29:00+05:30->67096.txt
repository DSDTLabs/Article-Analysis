Greater Noida: A section of   residents has complained that encroachers have been occupying space along the roads, affecting the “clean city” image. The residents also complained about unclean parks and kiosks and makeshift shops that have come up illegally.

 “We have registered complaints with the Greater Noida authority on the rampant   along the pavements by shops, kiosks etc. It is there on every crossing and road of residential sectors and commercial areas. Slowly, the whole city will be taken over by these pavement dwellers, who put up shops wherever they like and without following any rules. GNIDA officials do not want to step out of their offices and take action. Whenever there are any proceedings, somehow the information is leaked to the wayside sellers who withdraw from the area for a while, only to reappear again,” said Harinder Bhati, a resident of Beta 1 in Greater Noida. 
 
 Brijesh Nigam, another resident of Greater Noida, maintained that if officials of the Greater Noida authority take the problems seriously, the situation could have been resolved easily. Apart from encroachment, the residents also raised concerns about unclean green belts, broken roads and unauthorised paying guest accommodations.
