PATNA: The Larsen & Turbo Ltd on Sunday started work on the construction of a network of sewers in Patna under the   project.

 The 180-km sewerage will cover ward number 1 to 10 along with ward number 30 of Patna, benefiting around six lakh residents, said Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO)â€™s GM J N Singh.
 
 BUIDCO officials said on Monday the Rs 398-crore project would be completed in three years. It will not only help keep the Ganga clean, but also rid the state capital of waterlogging during the rains. 
 
 Apart from laying the sewers that will be connected to households, the L&T will also be responsible for their operation and maintenance for ten years years after the construction. 
 
 The city has been divided into six zones for construction of sewerage under the Namami Gange project. Besides the Beur area where the groundwork work has begun, other zones include Digha, Saidpur, Kankarbagh, Pahari and Karmali Chak. BUIDCO sources said the schemes for different zones have been allotted to various agencies, which are either in the process of making DPRs (detailed project reports) or doing survey of the localities concerned.
 
 The Namami Gange project also involves construction of two water treatment plants at Beur and Saidpur and renovation of an existing one at Beur.
