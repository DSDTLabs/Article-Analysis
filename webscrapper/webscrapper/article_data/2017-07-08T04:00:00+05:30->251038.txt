Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) still does not seem to have made up its mind to investigate the reasons for the dilapidated condition of houses made for the urban poor on the Sun Pharma Road. The civic body seems to be more focussed on redeveloping the site on a public-private partnership mode.

 The residents of Nilgiri have been making representations to the civic body since the last couple of days regarding the sorry condition of the houses there. In an irony of sorts, the VMC issued notices calling houses constructed by itself as ‘dangerous’ and this sparked a major row.
 
 The houses were constructed in 2002 and handed over to 240 beneficiaries subsequently. Within 15 years, the houses are in a rundown condition with plaster peeling off and iron rods used for them getting exposed. There are several seepages in the houses and lumps keep falling off the exteriors of the blocks.
 
 After the repeated representations by the residents, VMC had sent team to the site on Friday. While one would have expected that the civic body would take up action for the inferior quality of work and probe it, the team limited itself to the task of trying to convince the residents to agree to redevelopment of the site under the PPP mode.
 
 Officials said that if 60 per cent of the residents agreed to redevelopment, the VMC could go ahead and raze the buildings. High rise towers would be erected to rehabilitate the existing residents on a part of land where dilapidated low rise buildings now stand and the remaining plot would be used by the developer for commercial purposes.
 
 When asked about why the condition of the buildings was bad within 15 years, VMC in-charge city engineer Shailesh Mistry said that this could be because of various reasons and not necessarily bad quality work.
