NEW DELHI:  's first day of the destination bus service on Monday, evoked mixed response, with many commuters lauding the decision but complaining about the lack of information regarding the service. 

  The corporation has started the new bus service on the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and is plying buses on 20 routes in the morning and evening. The trips are scheduled at set times in the day, with the morning trip starting between 8.15 and 8.35am and the return trip scheduled for 5.55pm. Passengers who took the morning trip said that the service was good, but needed more publicity. It's a fact borne out by the numbers. None of the buses were running to capacity, with some of them on routes like Badarpur having as few as five passengers. 
 
 Delhi government officials, however, dismissed the first-day numbers, saying the feedback will become more realistic after a fortnight. The routes that got the maximum passengers were running in areas like Rohini and Patparganj. 
 
  spokesman RS Minhas said, "The number of trips will be revised depending on the response to the service." Trips are likely to increase if the ridership goes up, though this is likely to be decided only after a month. The point-to-point service was aimed at connecting the suburbs with central and south Delhi, where a large number of offices are located.
