BENGALURU: Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s   opened in at least 40 single-screen theatres and several multiplexes in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

 No incidents of interruptions or violence were reported, with most theatres running a paid premiere, open even to the general audience without invitation.
 
 Of the 100-odd single screens in the city, exhibitor-representatives in the   (KFCC) said at least 40 screened the movie at least for one show, while many had multiple shows. Most of the 126-odd multiplex screens had multiple shows.
 
 “We opened to a good response, even though it was a paid premiere. Most of our screens are showing Padmaavat and will continue to show even on Thursday,” a PVR official said.
 
 M Narasimhulu, secretary representing exhibitors at KFCC, said: “There has been no trouble with the screening and there were no untoward incidents.”
 
 Police said their patrol vehicles were sent to theatres in the morning as a precautionary measure and were called off as things remained peaceful. “However, two armed policemen continue to be stationed in front of Padmaavat heroine’s Deepika Padukone’s residence off Nandidurg Road. Also, patrol vehicles are keeping a close watch on the neighbourhood,” a police officer said.
