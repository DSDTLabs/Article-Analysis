Bengaluru: When it comes to punctuality, Mysuru tops   (SWR) divisions and is fifth among 69 railway divisions across the country. It has recorded a punctuality of 93.9% for express and mail trains.

 While   division is ranked eighth (92.1%) in the country, Bengaluru is at a distant 34th position with 75.4%. This was based on division-wise punctuality performance of mail and express trains across the country between April 23 and 29. “Bengaluru is way below compared to Mysuru and Hubballi because Bengaluru has an automatic system to record train timings. In Bengaluru, arrivasl and departures of trains from data loggers are directly linked to the system. But in Mysuru and Hubballi divisions, timings are manually entered, so there are possibilities of errors too,” said an official .
 
 He said they have undertaken a modernization drive and track renewal across SWR, which has affected punctuality of many trains. “In 2017-18 alone, a 200km track in SWR jurisdiction was replaced. Trains are delayed due to the maintenance work taken up across the country. Our focus is now on the safety of passengers; punctuality of trains will be improved once the track renewal work is completed”.
 
 Sources say automatic entry of arrival and departure of trains prevents fudging of data. Officials said punctuality above 85% is placed under A+ category while that in 75-85% range comes under A category. A punctuality rate of 60-75% range is categorised as B while that below 60% falls in C category.
 
 Rail activist   said the punctuality rate in Bengaluru division is lesser compared to Mysuru and Hubballi as the former handles more trains. “Bengaluru has seven direction railway tracks without automatic signalling system and too many level crossings. Automatic signalling, level-cross elimination, new terminal building and electrification will improve punctuality. SWR should complete doubling and quadrupling of tracks with electrification at the earliest,” he said.
