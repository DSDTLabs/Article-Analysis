BATHINDA: The   has termed the shifting of investigations in the   police firing, wherein two persons had died on October 14, 2015, from Faridkot police to   police as an eyewash.

 Party president   and vice-president Hardeep Singh Mehraj in a statement released on Sunday said prosecuting the culprits of Behbal Kalan firing was a challenge for the state government, which chief minister   must accept and adequately respond. They said shifting the case from one district to another does not make much sense as it was the same Punjab police that would handle the probe. Dal Khalsa leaders alleged that the orders for firing in which two protesters Gurjit Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh died were reportedly given by higher police officials.
 
 “It is highly regretful that the political willingness of the previous and present governments to nail the perpetrators is missing. Like Badals, Amarinder too has shown scant regard for rule of law and justice. He needs to inform the people about the circumstances that are stopping him from arresting the guilty police officers, who ordered unprovoked firing on protesting sangat at Behbal Kalan as everything is already on record,” Cheema said and added that people’s faith in democracy and rule of law stood shattered.
