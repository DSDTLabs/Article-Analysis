Actor   said now that her kids are grown up, she can spare some time for dating. 

  
  
 The   actor, who is a mother to two-year-old August and six-year-old  , whom she adopted as a single parent, said she had 'no interest' in finding a new partner while her kids were younger. 
 
 But with her daughter getting a year older, Theron admitted she could change her mind. 
 
 ''With both of my kids, the first two years, I had absolutely no interest in dating. It wasn't even a struggle - it was a case where my body chemistry and my mind just wanted to go to the place where I was 100 per cent satisfied with being a mom," Theron said.
 
 ''And then... Well it kind of changes. My little one will be three soon and I'm starting to feel like, 'Ok, I'm not dealing with diapers and wipes anymore and you know something? Right now I'm really happy," she added. 
 
 Theron, 42, said her friends are trying to set her up on dates but feels it was too much 'work' to do. 
 
 "Sometimes my friends will try to set me up and I'll say,' Right now that feels like more work than something I would really enjoy. I think I would have to change that mindset before I start dating again," Theron said. 
 
 Theron had dated actor   from 2002-2010. She later got engaged to   in 2014 after meeting him a year ago. But the couple ended their relationship in June 2015.
