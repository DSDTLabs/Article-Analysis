Madurai: The state is in the process of drafting food processing policy in consultation with others which are leading in food processing industry, state commissioner of agricultural marketing and agri business, Shunchongam Jatak Chiru has said. He was speaking after inaugurating a one-day seminar on food processing and post-harvest value addition, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) Madurai Chapter with support of the Union ministry of food processing industries here on Tuesday. “The profitability and safety are two main aspects of the sector and government focuses on enhancing the food processing sector and supply chain management. Efforts are underway to develop Tamil Nadu as destination for food processing,” he said. Addressing the gathering, S Suresh, dean in-charge, Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai, said that though India has become a net exporter of many agricultural products, its share in world trade in agriculture is just 2 per cent. “There is a need to turn our farmers into entrepreneurs. Due to lack of adequate post-harvest and food processing infrastructure, more than 20% of cereals, and up to 40% of vegetables and fruits go waste. India’s post-harvest loss is estimated at a whopping Rs 53,000 crore. The need of the hour is post-harvest management and food processing capabilities,” he said. T N Balamohan, professor and head of department of horticulture and crops from Agricultural College and Research Institute touched on the supply and value chain and government policies for food processing industry. A P J Jaisingh Vaerkar from The Peninsular Export Company, G Ajeethan from Tamil Nadu Banana Producer Company, M Palanisamy, programme leader, and Rainfed Farming Development Programme, Wilson Jebaraj from Commercial Refrigeration of Blue Star spoke.
