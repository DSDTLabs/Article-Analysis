BENGALURU: Eight years after he jumped parole, a 40-year-old murder convict has finally landed in police net.

 Besides the convict, Venkatesh Perumal, RMC Yard police have also arrested his younger brother  , 35, who stood surety for his sibling by giving a false address and went missing thereafter.
 
 While Venkatesh was arrested in Coimbatore,  , Murali was picked up from   in simultaneous raids carried out by two teams recently, said deputy commissioner of police (north)  .
 
 According to police, Venkatesh was serving life term for murdering his wife in 2005. “A mason, he lived in   and set his wife ablaze. Prison officials granted him parolefor firsttime in early 2009. Since Venkatesh adhered to the conditions, he was granted parole again in early 2010. He availed of it for the third time in late 2010 when he went missing,” he said.
 
 Murali stood surety for Venkatesh every time he went on parole. Murali had produced documents to show that he was working at a coffee estate in Machegondanahalli, Chikkamagaluru. “In January 2011, a team visited the place and found Murali had provided a false address. A case was registered at RMCYard policestation against the brothers and a manhunt began,” police said. Recently, an informant alerted police that Murali worked in Krishnagiri.
 
 “We sent a decoy to verify the news. We didn’t arrest Murali immediately as there was no news of Venkatesh. One of our staffers befriended Murali and gradually got him to speak about Venkatesh. Murali spilled the beans, saying that Venkatesh worked as a mason in Coimbatore,” a senior police officer said.
