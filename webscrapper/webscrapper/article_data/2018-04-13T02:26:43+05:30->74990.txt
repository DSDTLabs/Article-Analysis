CHENNAI: PM   on Thursday sought to allay fears of the southern states, saying the Centre has suggested to the 15th   to consider incentivising states that have worked on population control.

 
 His remarks come in the backdrop of these states expressing concerns over “biased” terms of reference of the Finance Commission, especially the mandate to make recommendations using 2011 census data. Modi said the allegations were being made by “vested” interests and the Centre was committed to cooperative federalism.
 
 Modi was speaking at an event to inaugurate the diamond jubilee building at   here. 
 
 The southern states that had made great strides in controlling the rate of population growth felt penalised by the Centre. The devolution of central taxes is based on census 1971 until now. 
 
 Modi said a baseless allegation was being made about the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. He said there was no bias against certain states or a particular region. 
 
  
  
 
 "(With the Centre's latest recommendation to the Finance Commission)... a state like  , which has devoted a lot of effort, energy and resources towards population control would certainly benefit," he said.
 
  
  
 
 The Prime Minister said the Centre was committed to cooperative federalism. "“Let us all work together to build a new India which would make our great freedom fighters proud,” Modi said.
