HYDERABAD: The Central Board of Secondary Education’s ( ) decision to not ‘moderate’ or ‘standardise’ the results of the Class XII examination has evoked mixed response in the city.

 Most students and parents are worried since the announcement has come right before the declaration of the Class XII board examination results. “The CBSE should have made such announcements regarding grading and average marks before the examination. Students across the country might have prepared differently had this been the case. The CBSE has not taken the high cut-offs in many undergraduate colleges into account,” said Ramani Kotha, a parent.
 
 Her thoughts were echoed by the heads of a few CBSE schools in the city. “Inflating the marks has been an unfair yet common practice in the CBSE board exams. While in the long run, putting an end to moderation might be right move, the board should ideally have made the announcement in December so that students could mentally prepare themselves,” said Seetha Murthy, principal, Silver Oaks School.
 
 The average marks of Class XII board exams are likely to see a dip this year. “It is the schools that boast of high pass percentages and average marks who will be impacted. The real performance of students, sans the advantage of moderation, will be revealed,” said S Vandana, principal of Vigyan Vidyalaya in Nizampet.
