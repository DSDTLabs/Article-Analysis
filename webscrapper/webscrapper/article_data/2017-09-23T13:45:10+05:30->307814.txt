MANGALURU: Confusion created by grouping  , DK and   districts as one unit and rest of Karnataka as another for Dasara holidays this year will not be repeated next year. Due note will be taken of holiday calendar announced well in advance by the competent authority and department of public instruction will ensure that the academic calendar chalked out for 2018-19 is in sync with the national holidays, minister for primary and secondary education   said.

 In an informal chat with STOI on the sidelines of launch of Mane Manege Congress campaign,   admitted that decision to have separate Dasara holidays for above three districts and rest of Karnataka has caused confusion among parents, teachers, students and even within the department. “We normally announce the academic calendar keeping in mind all these events. However, since Dasara has come a bit early this year, we are facing this peculiar situation,” he said.
 
 Initially, the state government advanced Dasara holidays for schools and colleges in Mysuru and based on demands from Kodagu and  , the holidays were advanced for these two districts as well. “I am now flooded with request from   for holiday parity similar to DK,” Sait said, adding there is no politics in advancing Dasara holidays in DK and Kodagu. “Dasara dates change based on amavasye, and nakshatra (position of stars),” he noted.
 
 Asserting that as the minister, has no role in deciding the academic calendar, Sait said this is an administrative process. “There is a system and few decisions are taken by as part of the set up,” he said, adding the last minute change in holidays has also forced the department to re-schedule its Vishwa Kirana remedial programme for the educationally backward students that was fixed with resource persons for the dasara holidays initially scheduled from October 11 to 25.
