 is a workaholic and we just got proof. The director, whose film Nagarkirtan was honoured with four National Awards at the 65
  National Film Awards, is not ready to sit on his laurels. He is busy promoting his end-April release,   starring Prosenjit Chatterjee and Rituparna Sengupta. Amidst his busy schedule, he has flown to London with wife Churni. No, it’s not to take a few days off before his film hits the theatres in  , but to recce for Churni’s Tarikh. The Kolkata chapter of the film is over and a few scenes are likely to be shot in London and the husband-wife are busy location-hunting! Drishtikone also stars Kaushik and Churni, apart from the Bengali screen’s famous jodi.
