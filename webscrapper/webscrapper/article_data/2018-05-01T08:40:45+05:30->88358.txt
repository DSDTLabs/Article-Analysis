AHMEDABAD: A day after 45 members of a   family, whose members were flogged by cow vigilantes at  , renounced Hinduism, the victims said they would begin a campaign to build a temple to Lord Buddha at the site where they were thrashed.

 
  family, whose four sons had been flogged by cow vigilantes in Gujaratâ€™s Una in July 2016, had converted to Buddhism, at a ceremony in Una taluka of Gir-Somnath district on Sunday.
 
 Balu Sarvaiya, father of Ramesh and Vashram Sarvaiya, who were beaten along with Bechar and Ashok Sarvaiya, said he will seek help from atrocity victims across Gujarat to collect bricks for the temple to commemorate the flogging so people know about its history.
 
 He said the construction of the Buddha temple may take time as they do not have significant capital and will need donations from community members.
