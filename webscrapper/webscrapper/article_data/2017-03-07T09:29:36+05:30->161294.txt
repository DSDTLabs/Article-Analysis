VISAKHAPATNAM: Apart from several civic issues that have been left un-addressed by the Greater   (GVMC), residents of   have one major issue that needs urgent attention —   by students of various educational intuitions in the vicinity.

 Sunday’s car accident in which two youth died and two others were injured has the   about their and their love one’s lives.
 
 K Srinivasa Rao, a senior citizen residing in the area, said there are civic problems that need to be rectified, but they are not as serious as rash driving along the adjacent Vizag-Bheemili   which can kill anyone.
 
 “Sunday’s incident was not new to us. But, the death of two young people was sad. We frequently see such rash driving on the road mostly by college students. Though there is a check-post at Jodugullapalem Junction, the youth take alternative routes to evade the cops,” Rao said.
 
 Another resident M Mahesh said, “If anyone wants to escape from getting caught by the cops, they take the alternative route through Visalakshi Nagar. Though there are speed-breakers in the area, accidents continue to occur and the residents are scared.” Speaking to TOI, Arilova circle inspector Ch Tirupathi Rao, who had rescued the injured persons on Sunday, said, “Self-discipline and parental control can prevent rash and drunken driving. If we want to chase them, they try to escape by speeding. Such incidents can be controlled only if there is proper control and vigil by the parents.” Besides the fear of accidents, the residents also complained about the poor drainage system in the area.
 
 S Naveen, a Gitam University faculty, said, “Most of the canals, especially along the main road, are filled with solid waste, plastic. This has led to an increase in mosquitoes in the area. The civic authorities should clean the area and maintain a hygienic surrounding.”
