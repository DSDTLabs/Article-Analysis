Surat: Tears welled up in the eyes of 11-year-old Mithhu   when he met his father almost three years after he went missing. His mother passed away in shock when he went missing in 2014 at the age of eight. 

 Efforts of several policemen of  , Gujarat and Rajasthan along with officials of children’s home in Chennai and Surat paid off when Mithhu hugged his father in the Diamond City on Saturday. Mithhu thought of supporting his poor family and had arrived in the city with a known person from a neighbouring village in   taluka of Udaipur district three years ago. 
 
 Jivaram came to know about his son’s location and reached the city to take his only son home as the person who brought Mitthu to Surat had failed to keep his promise of sending him back. Mithhu too was longing for home and boarded a train from Surat railway station. Unfortunately, the train he boarded reached Chennai.
 
 “The boy was spotted by police in Chennai and they sent him to a children’s home where he had been staying since then. Recently, the officials from there contacted us since Mithhu had told them that he used to live near a water tank in Surat,” said  , in-charge of V R Popawala Children Home.
 
 He was recently brought to Surat and lodged at the children’s home whose officials with police teams spent several hours to help him identify his home. Meanwhile, Mithhu was able to recollect the name of his uncle’s village after which police officials from   in Rajasthan were contacted. They put sarpanch of Karva village in touch with the children’s home officials here.
 
 “A photo of Jivaram was shared on mobile phone and Mithhu identified his father from the image. Jivaram arrived in the city on Saturday with documents and after verification the boy was handed over to him,” Khadsaliya said.
 
 “It is a miracle to meet him. My wife had died of shock after our only son went missing and we failed to find him,” Jivaram said.
