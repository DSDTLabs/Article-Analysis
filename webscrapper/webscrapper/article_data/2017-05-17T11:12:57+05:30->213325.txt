The four victims went to Niphad hospital where they were asked to go to the civil hospital for an anti-rabies injection, like the other two victims. Now, I will administer the same here,” he said.
 
 In fear of facing more such incidents, the local residents killed the dog immediately. Villagers have   of more such incidents as monsoon is expected in a fortnight, which is the mating season for dogs and there is no sterilisation facility in the village.
 
 Shinde said that usually the gram panchayat decides to put the dog to sleep after such incidents or complaintes from villagers. “Also, if water is poured over the head of a rabid dog, it dies because it has hydrophobia,” he added.
