Avantika, explains director  , is the chic urban girl in the tale. “She is the main female lead in the film and plays a rich city girl, who likes the fast life, with parties and fun. She also represents the quintessential urbanite who works in the corporate sector. Guru, on the other hand, is the quiet and shy village boy, who happens to meet her. The love story between them is a prominent track in the film,” says the filmmaker.
 Choosing Avantika for the role became a no-brainer after the team saw her performance in  , adds Naresh. “In that film also she had essayed the role of a smart city girl and we knew that she would do justice to the role. Even then, we auditioned her, which only confirmed our belief. To affirm her character in the film, we even got her to ride a superbike for a sequence, which she did with ease. She did whatever was expected of her to make the character as relatable as possible and that’s what made working with her such a breeze,” he says.
