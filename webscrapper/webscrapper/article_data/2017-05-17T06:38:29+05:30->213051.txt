AHMEDABAD: The transport sector is the biggest factor contributing to carbon monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions in Ahmedabad. Of CO emissions of 150Gg/per year (1Gg= 1,000 tonnes), around 95.5Gg came from the transport sector. It also contributes 69.54Gg of the total 102.94Gg/per year (67%) of NOx emissions in the city. 

 This was revealed by in a joint emissions inventory study of the Ahmedabad metropolitan region by the ministry of earth sciences and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. The study mapped emissions over an area of 30x35km.
 
 The study claims to be the first of its kind for Ahmedabad. It also revealed that petrol vehicles emit more carbon monoxide than diesel vehicles. In Ahmedabad city, about 48% of four-wheelers and 100% of two-wheelers run on petrol.
 
 The study further said that another major contributor to CO was the domestic sector, which includes emission from slums where biofuels and traditional stoves are used for cooking. Low quality of cooking fuels with poor combustion technology leads to high CO emissions in these areas, the study pointed out. The study further states that pollution hotspots are also observed in areas with dense residential colonies and slum pockets. 
 
 The study further stated that CNG vehicles emit more oxides of nitrogen than diesel and petrol vehicles. However, due to the small number of CNG vehicles, NOx emissions were comparatively less.
 
 The study further stated that the heaviest movement of the vehicles was seen at   ( ) and Nehru Bridge. At the RTO, 1.70 lakh-odd vehicles pass the circle, which meant 118 vehicles per minutes. Similarly, at   81 vehicles passed the area every minute.
 
 The study pointed out that though Bharat Stage IV was launched in 2010, only 18% of vehicles in the city are BS-IV compliant. Some 18% of vehicles in Ahmedabad roads did not comply with any Bharat stage standard.
