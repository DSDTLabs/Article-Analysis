New Delhi: The 143rd academic   (AC) meeting of the Jawaharlal Nehru University was   on Tuesday, after the VC allegedly tried to forego the minutes of the previous meeting to show that it was passed, according to the   Student’s Union. 

 The VC’s move was opposed by a section of teachers who demanded an amendment to the minutes. The JNUSU claimed it was a major victory as “the VC ran away from the AC meeting by adjourning it and he was left with no option to lie either in the court or before the media.”
 
 The JNUSU said that the VC also could not pass the admission policy based on the May 5 UGC gazette notification.
 
 In the meeting, the first agenda was to confirm the minutes of the 142nd AC meeting. It was contested by many members of the JNU Teachers’ Association who said that the “minutes have larger implication on JNU’s admission policy, so they must be corrected and without it we cannot move ahead with any other agenda.”
 
 Earlier some JNU faculty members had written to the administration informing them of the same.
 
 JNUSU in its statement claimed that “among the 40 members present, 29 members signed on an amendment note for the correction of minutes.”
