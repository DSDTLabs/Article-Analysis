SURAT: The brutally raped and murdered 11-year-old girl and her mother are suspected to be from some place near New Delhi or its neighbouring region.

 Sources said the detection of crime branch (DCB) teams are camping in New Delhi and places like Faridabad and   to trace their origins and family, who is suspected of selling them to make quick money.
 
 Prime accused   has revealed more names during interrogation and police have also questioned some suspects that he has named. He also told police that the woman had stayed in Jaipur, Delhi, Faridabad and Nizamuddin. She is suspected to have been sold multiple times by different persons due to which tracing her origin has become a challenge for the police. 
 
 The 35-year-old woman and her 11-year-old daughter were found murdered in the city on April 9 and April 6 respectively. Postmortem of the girl had revealed that she had 86 injuries, including serious ones in her private parts, that were allegedly inflicted by Gurjar, who had purchased the duo for Rs 35,000 and brought them as bonded labourers in his marble fitting business in Pandesara.
 
 Investigation also revealed that he had brought them from two persons named Kuldeep and Mukesh in   village of Rajasthan’s Sawai Madhopur district. Gurjar, too, was nabbed by the Ahmedabad crime branch from Gangapur on April 20.
 
 “We have recovered some old photos of the woman from a person and her family will be traced soon,” a source said.
 
 “It seems that the woman was sold by her husband or father to some agents. They sold her at different places and ultimately she was brought to Surat by Gurjar. If the family members are found, they can reveal many details,” a source in the police department said.
