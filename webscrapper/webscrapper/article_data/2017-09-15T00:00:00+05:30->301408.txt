South stars made a beeline to a popular star hotel in the city, on Wednesday evening. The occasion was the audio launch of an upcoming   movie. Director B Unnikrishnan anchored the programme which was all glam and glitter. The superstar looked classy in a shiny brown shirt and jeans, sporting his latest bearded look, while Manju Warrier was in her usual girl next-door look in a white salwar.

 Newcomer Raashi Khanna from Tollywood, who looked drop-dead gorgeous in a cream coloured silk sari, also sang a song from the movie on being requested, in her beautiful voice with a non-Malayali twang to it. The launch was quite eventful and funny; for when B Unnikrishnan called upon director Siddique to the stage, actor Siddique stood up, and walked towards the stage before realising his mistake and turning around. Finally when he got a chance to speak, he admitted his mistake, saying that he thought he was the only Siddique at the event. ‘Thank God I didn’t step on to the stage’ he said. Mohanlal said that his character in the movie is completely different from all that he has done in his acting career; but to know whether he’s playing a villain or a hero, one has to watch the movie. Also seen at the event were director Siddique, Anil Radhakrishnan Menon, Joshiey, Lijo Jose Pellissery, Dileesh Pothan, Muthumani, RS Vimal, musician Sushin Shyam and Hari Narayanan.
