NEW DELHI: On Tuesday, several reports claimed India are toying with the idea of calling   for the fourth and final Test of the ongoing four-match series against Australia in Dharamsala. 

 When   was asked about the inclusion of the paceman, he didn't give a straight answer but left the question open ended. 
 
 "We sent him to play, wanted to give him match practice. I've not spoken to selectors but all kinds of possibility approaching the next Test," Kohli said.
 
 But on Wednesday, a day after the Indian cricket team reached Dharamsala for the series-decider, the fit-again Shami took to social media posting a picture of the the picturesque city confirming he has indeed joined the squad and raised possibility of making his international comeback against Australia.
  
  
 Shami was out of action after hurting his knee during the third Test against England last year and recently returned to competitive cricket playing in a Vijay Hazare Trophy group match for Bengal against Gujarat earlier this month. He then played in the final of the domestic one-day tournament against Tamil Nadu on March 20 where he sent down 8.2 overs and picked up 4/26 at Delhi's   stadium. 
 
 Tamil Nadu went on to win the final but Shami left everyone impressed with his performance on return from a long injury. The India-Australia series is currently tied at 1-1 and the inclusion of the Bengal pacer will be a major boost to the home team's hopes of winning back the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
 
 The 26-year-old Shami has so far played 22 Tests for India since making debut in 2013, picking up 76 wickets at 32.60. Before he was ruled out of the entire England series, the pacer had been quite effective with the ball with 10 scalps to his name.
