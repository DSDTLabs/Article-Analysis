CHENNAI: There were   errors in 49 of the 180 questions in   Tamil medium paper claimed  , a Chennai-based  , which conducted special training classes for the exam for below poverty line students in Tamil Nadu.

 At a press meeting on Wednesday, representatives of the NGO pointed out the translation errors in the Tamil question paper of the NEET held on May 6.
 
  
 Pointing out to an example, they said that the Tamil translation of cheetah is ‘siruthai’, but instead it appeared as ‘seetha’ on the question paper (question no. 75).
 
 Another error is that for the word ‘multiple allele’ (a technical word in biology) in question number 77, which was printed as ‘pala kutu allelgal’. It should have been ‘pal kootu,’ they said.
 
 Similar errors had occurred in 47 other questions and the CBSE should provide grace   for all these questions, said Teach For All founder G B Ram Prakash. “This means, every candidate who took up the test in Tamil should get 196 points as grace marks,” he said.
 
 According to him, the reason for the confusion is that there are no NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) books available in Tamil and that the CBSE failed to standardise technical words in Tamil.
 
 Last year, different question papers were given to   and Tamil candidates and the CBSE had assured the Supreme Court that the errors would not be repeated this year, he said.
 
 In case of ambiguity in the translation of any question, its English version shall be treated as final says a disclaimer printed on page one of the question paper in Tamil. “It’s okay to ask the students to refer to the English version of the questions in case of one or two errors. Students will not be able to find enough time to go through both, English and Tamil versions for 49 questions,” he added.
 
 Around 24,000 students took NEET-UG in Tamil this year.
 
 CBSE authorities at the Chennai regional office refused to comment when TOI contacted them.
