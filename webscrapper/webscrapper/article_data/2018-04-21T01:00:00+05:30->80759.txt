 With loads of   lassi for company, the summer heat has in no way affected the shooting of   and   starrer film '  – The Fear Behind You', going on in full swing in Banaras. Director   says, “The city charmed me ever since I first came here. I always seek an opportunity to come back to Banaras. Even for 'Mushkill', which is mainly shot in Greece, there was a flash back sequence in which we had to show an Indian city and I readily picked Banaras. The story of the film starts from Banaras and ends here.”

 Rajniesh, who has been to Banaras earlier to shoot one of his films, believes that it is destiny which brings him to Banaras. “I feel very connected to the city. A visit to the   temple is a must whenever I am here. My bonding with the city has grown as I have got the opportunity to play Banarasi characters in films .”
