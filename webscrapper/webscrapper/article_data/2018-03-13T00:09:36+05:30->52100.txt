Chandigarh: Government hospitals lack a mechanism to pay compensation by the guilty doctor for alleged medical negligence. In fact, the hospitals pay the amount, while the erring doctors go scot-free. However, in a private hospital, the accused doctor has to pay from his/her salary as doctors are insured and any medical error has to be compensated from that insured amount.

 “In private hospitals, all doctors are insured and any penalty is deducted from that amount as the hospital does not pay from its pocket. The same must be followed in public hospitals,” said Dr K K Talwar, former director, PGI.
 
 In the infamous case of Suman, a resident of Colony Number 4 admitted to Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, in 2010, the consumer forum had directed the guilty to pay Rs 4 lakh. Due to wrong blood transfusion, Suman’s both kidneys were affected and her foetus died in the womb. A negligence committee was set up by the UT administration and it was found that two doctors and a laboratory technician were at fault. “It’s the tax payers’ money which goes as a penalty and the guilty doctors have nothing to lose. In fact, the court’s order had named the accused,” said Pankaj Chandgothia, Suman’s counsel.
 
 The most discussed case at PGI was of Anupama Sarkar, a 16-year-old girl who had died due to delay in treatment in PGI, in 2012. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had ordered PGI to pay Rs 17 lakh in compensation to parents of Anupama who died because of complications arising from delay in treatment. “The doctors on contract and under National Health Mission are insured. If they are found guilty of medical error, that amount is paid from that amount. This is not so for all the doctors on role as the government takes responsibility of the doctors or other supporting staff on roles,” said Dr G Dewan, director health services, UT.
