NEW DELHI: In a bid to improve the financial health of the  ,   is exploring the possibility of creating a system whereby the   can give financial assistance directly to the cash-strapped civic bodies. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said the party was toying with the idea of amending the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act to facilitate this change.

 “The financial assistance provided by the Centre is directed via the state government at present. This government played dirty by not releasing   on time. We are planning to amend the DMC Act, so that the Centre can directly provide funds to corporations. Close to Rs 9,000 crore is allocated to the corporations annually, which they should get directly.”
 
 According to BJP sources, the corporations are struggling to pay salaries. The sanitation workers have gone on strike five times in the past two years due to non-payment of salaries. Besides, the civic bodies have not been able to take up new projects as it doesn’t have funds.
 
 Tiwari alleged the state government didn’t release funds on time. He lashed out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for depriving the BJP-led corporations of its rightful share in the state’s funds by not implementing the recommendations of the 4th Delhi  . Had the government implemented 4th DFC’s recommendations, corporations would have been financially viable by now, say BJP members.
 
 The commission recommends that the corporations should get a higher share in taxes collected by the state government and 100% grant-in-aid in education. Instead of 5.5%, the commission recommends 12.5% share in state’s taxes, duties, fees and toll. BJP says 12.5% share in taxes will help them meet their basic expenses and start some development work.
