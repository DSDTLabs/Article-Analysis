 At the reception in Delhi, all rituals were in repeat mode. The couple not only had two weddings, even the entry of the baraat and of the bride happened twice – once just for Venkaiah Naidu, who had arrived early, and again for the rest of the guests later in the night. “Venkaiah Naidu had informed us that he will come around 7:30pm and that is why the baraat came early, Tina made her entry so that the Vice President can congratulate them together,” said a member of the family.
