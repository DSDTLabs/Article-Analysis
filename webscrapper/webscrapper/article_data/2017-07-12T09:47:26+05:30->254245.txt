KOCHI:   (Cial) is set to amplify its solar generation capacity further this year from 22 MW to 30 MW by fully commissioning its solar carport and solar panels at the   canal. Furthermore,   plans to generate a total of 100MW by 2020 from all their solar and hydro energy projects.

 When the latest international terminal was inaugurated by chief minister   earlier this year, he had also commissioned the expansion of Cial's solar project from 15.5MW to 22MW .
 
 The expansion was undertaken to meet the increased energy requirement of the international airport. To do so, the airport authorities added solar panels at three locations--the hangar premises which will generate 3MW , the southern side of the airport to produce 2MW and 1 MW from the solar carport.
 
 The solar project at Chengalthodu canal has been delayed by three months by local unions who alleged that setting up the panels above the canal will affect the flow of water thereby decreasing the availability of water for farmers in the area. The solar project has been planned upon the 18km stretch of the canal passing through Cial property .Solar panels will be placed at the canal and the project is set to be operational this year. The panels will contribute 4.5MW of power to the airport's solar project.
 
 Cial officials have suggested that they plan to continue expanding their solar power generation capacity at the airport facility by setting up solar panels at more unused spaces on their property .
 
 Furthermore, the Cial plans on generating another 62MW from its hydroelectric projects by the end of 2020.
