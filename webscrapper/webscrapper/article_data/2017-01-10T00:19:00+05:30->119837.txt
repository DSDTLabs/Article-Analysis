PUNE: The retail price of cow’s   is set to rise by Rs2 per litre from January 11. From Wednesday, a 1-litre pouch of milk will cost Rs42, instead of Rs40. Buffalo milk’s retail price is also being hiked by Rs2 — from Rs52 to Rs54. 

 The decision was taken on Sunday at a meeting of the   dairies to discuss issues pertaining to milk production and sales. To protect the interests of the milk producers, it was also decided to increase the purchasing price of milk from farmers by Rs3. 
 
 Representatives of dairies said a hike was inevitable because of a consistent drop in milk production, reduced availability of milk in the retail market and the purchase of milk by milk-powder manufacturers — and even by neighbouring states — at higher rates. 
 
 Prakash Kutwal, vice chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Milk Federation Action Committee, said drought which affected the state for two years on the trot rendered the farmers unable to provide good quality fodder to their milk cattle. That in turn affected milk production.
 
 He added that those farmers who were producing milk instead preferred to sell to milk-powder manufacturers, who are prepared to pay a higher price. “The hike in purchase price will now push farmers to sell milk to dairies. Hence, dairies had decided to increase the price by Rs2 to recover cost,” Kutwal said. 
 
 Vishnu Hinge, chairman of the Pune District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation said milk collection had dropped by at least 20% due to last year’s drought. Also, demonetisation made it difficult for farmers to purchase or sell cattle. The increase in purchase price would mean the farmers would get good returns from selling milk.
