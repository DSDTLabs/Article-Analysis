NEW DELHI: The DU   for   has decided to   the   of   of   from this year by including two more segments —  . 

 Till last year,   offered 5% quota to five of the seven segments — defence personnel killed or disabled in action, those who died in peace time with death attributable to military service, those disabled in peace time during military service, and recipients of gallantry awards.
 
 Mukta Rai, wife of an Army officer who is looking at options for her daughter’s admissions, said while a few Delhi-based universities offered a quota to the children of retired and serving defence personnel, DU so far gave it a miss. “The university was effectively leaving out hundreds of aspirants though there is a government notification to this effect and other universities in Delhi follow it.” 
 
 A former DU student said her brother had applied in DU, hoping to get some concessions because of his armed forces link. “But DU did not consider him. Fortunately, he finally got admission at SRCC on his merit.” 
 
 Applicants under this category will also have to register online on the DU portal for admissions to various undergraduate courses. Aspirants applying under other reserved categories — SC, ST, OBC and people with disabilities, Kashmiri migrants and Sikkimese students. Those applying under these categories should produce self-attested copy of their valid certificates, if applicable.
 
 “For these applicants, DU provides a number of benefits,” said Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, the officer on special duty of UG admissions. However, he also pointed out that many of these categories have a cap and the seats are limited.
 
 All reserved categories enjoy 5% quota in all courses at DU colleges.
