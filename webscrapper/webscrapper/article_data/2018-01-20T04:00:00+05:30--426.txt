Surat: The 60-year-old tantrik detained for raping a 16-year old minor in August 2017 was formally arrested on Friday after medical examination of the girl confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted several times. 

 Mahendragiri Goswami, a resident of Kapodara, who was booked under IPC Section 376 and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) for raping the girl at his house, had threatened her of dire consequences if she complained to anyone about it. The girl, whose father died a few years ago and lives with her uncle in the city, shared her trauma with his family only recently. Kapodara police officials arrested the tantrik a day after he was detained by them on Thursday. 
 
 Police said they are still recording statements of relatives of the rape survivor and others. The maternal uncle of rape survivor and the accused are colleagues. They work in a school as drivers. The accused had asked his colleague to send his niece to help him clean his house since his family had gone out of station for a few days. When the minor girl reached his house, the tantrik pounced on her saying it was wish of the goddess that she pleases him.
