Actor  , who tied the knot on March 3 with  , is back to work. Last seen as a dapper prince on the TV show  ', he is all set to join the cast of ' '. He says, “My character will be central to the storyline, along with the three main characters of the show. The concept seemed interesting, and the show talks about a lot of socially relevant issues. Entering a show midway has its challenges as the character needs to fit into the already established synergies on the show and you aren’t starting with a clean slate. However, I also feel that since 'Udaan' is an established show, it’s a huge perk because you know that from day one you will already have eyeballs.”

 Speaking about getting back to work soon after marriage, the actor says, “Well, I love my work and hence, it’s never too early. In fact, both   and I were itching to get back to work and luckily, both of us have started working around the same time. I now have a reason to look forward to my evenings as I will come home to my family and spend some quality time with my wife!”
