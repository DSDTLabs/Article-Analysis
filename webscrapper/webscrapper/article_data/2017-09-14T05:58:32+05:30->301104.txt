PATNA: The JD(U) on Wednesday take a dig at rebel party leader   for siding with   chief Lalu Prasad and asked its former party president to join RJD without any further delay.

 “Sharad should accept the RJD symbol ‘lantern’ without any further delay, as he has no other option but to join RJD to survive in politics,” JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar told reporters here on Wednesday.
 
 He also alleged that Sharad was siding with RJD chief mainly because he knew that once leading members of Lalu family go behind bars in corruption cases, he could become the custodian of his properties.
 
 "Since the day Sharad has become the ‘political uncle’ of Lalu’s sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, he is eyeing all the properties of Lalu Prasad. He wants to become the custodian of Lalu’s benami properties after leading members of the RJD chief’s family go to jail,” he said.
 
 On Tuesday, Sharad received a major setback after the Election Commission denied his faction’s claim on the JD(U) symbol, arrow. “As Election Commission refused to take cognisance of his petition, Sharad should now formally join the RJD and accept its election symbol ‘lantern’ as his own,” Neeraj said. 
 
 He also said Sharad and another party rebel and MP Ali Anwar were already served notices by Rajya Sabha Chairman   last Monday, asking them to explain their position in response to a JD(U) petition seeking their disqualification from the Upper House.
 
 The Nitish Kumar faction of JD(U) has been claiming that Sharad had “voluntarily” quit the membership of the party after he attended RJD’s rally at   here on August 27.
