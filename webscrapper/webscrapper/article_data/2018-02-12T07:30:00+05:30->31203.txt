Zirakpur: No signals, medians, marked lanes, or speed breakers—this   is quite pedestrian in terms of traffic management, for which there is no plan even after many representations.

 At the traffic-diversions points on his highway that runs through Zirakpur, TOI found no traffic lights. It is main reason behind those morning-and-evening logjams on the VIP Road. Residents demand traffic lights in the area, along with speed breakers and road dividers on the junctions. Commuter Manoj Das of Savitary Society in Zirakpur said: “Since the day my family shifted to Zirakpur, traffic chaos has become part of our life.”
 
 Nikhil Mishra of Maya Garden-1 said: “For the people who have their houses on the VIP Road, it’s a struggle to reach home after 6:30pm.” Social worker Navjit Singh Miglani, who has his house on the VIP Road, said the town’s authorities should also create more parking space. He said: “On a vacant space on the VIP Road, all the waste from the nearby housing societies and market is dumped. The authorities should get this land cleaned and mark it as a parking lot.”
