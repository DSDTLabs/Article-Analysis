BENGALURU: Protesting against the proposed privatisation of Church Street, several people staged a silent demonstration at the road’s junction with Brigade Road on Friday. 

 Mayor  , who arrived at the spot, promised a consultation meeting with stakeholders before any decision was made.
 
  and Commons, street vendors and others are against the creation of exclusive zones and removal of street vendors, as mentioned in the terms of the tender that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had called for in March.
 
 The tender requires the private agency to take up regular sweeping and clearing of garbage, removing unauthorized optic fibre cables, ensuring round-the-clock security, checking encroachment by street vendors and and maintaining the road landscape.
 
 The mayor clarified that the intention was only to ensure that the “world-class road” is in good shape.
 
 “There is no question of privatisation. The ash and soot have a tendency to blacken the cobblestones and thus simply sweeping is not enough, but would require a hydraulic spray. We received plaints from the shopkeepers that unauthorized hawkers were troubling patrons and eating into their businesses. That is why we thought of security guards to keep out troublemakers, as well as to ensure that costly road furniture like LED lights are not stolen at night,” he said.
 
 Kshitij Urs, convenor of the forum, said the tender sought to hand over some of the primary obligatory functions of the civic body to private parties. This is different from the other instances of median and skywalk maintenance being outsourced to private agencies, as cited by the BBMP.
 
 Isaac Amrutharaj, president of Slum Janara Sanghatane, said the vendors on Church Street were also useful for the employees of establishments around the area. “People working in stores and restaurants can’t afford to eat at high-end places, but grab snacks and fruits at a low cost from these hawkers,” he said.
