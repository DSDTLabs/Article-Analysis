PATNA: The state transport department will launch five new buses on   (PU) route on Wednesday. The buses, being launched for the convenience of the PU students, will run at an interval of every 15 minutes.

 A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting between state transport secretary   and PU officials on Tuesday. The buses will start from   and pass through Patna Medical College and Hospital, Science College, Patna College and National Institute of Technology-Patna between 7am and 10pm. One has to pay Rs 5 for boarding the bus at any stoppage.
 
 On Sunday, a PU students’ union delegation led by its president   had met CM   and requested him to launch city bus service on the university route. The CM immediately asked the transport department to consider the demand.
 
 “The move is expected to benefit a large number of students. The transport department is launching the bus service on the route after a gap of 35 years. There will be five intermediate stoppages on the route,” Agarwal said, adding like other recently launched city buses, the ones on the Gandhi Maidan-PU route will also be equipped with CCTV cameras and GPS “Unlike other city buses, students will be given priority over regular commuters on this route. Also, 50% seats will be reserved for girl students,” the transport secretary added.
 
 He said concessional monthly passes would be issued to the students depending on the footfall of passengers on this route.
 
 PU students’ union president Divyanshu Bharadwaj said, “We have our summer breaks from May 26 to June 30, during which students’ union will conduct a survey to track the routes with maximum number of students. We will submit a report to the transport department with request for buses on more routes connected to the university.”
