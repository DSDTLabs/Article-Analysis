Chintapalli: The CPI   warned the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha governments that they would pay a heavy price for Ramaguda encounter where 31 Left extremists were gunned down in October 2016. The Maoists vowed to continue their struggle and carry forward the ideology of their fallen comrades. 

 Friday marked the beginning of the ‘Martyrs Week’ celebrated by the extremists on the Andhra-Odisha border. Despite heavy patrolling by security personnel, the meeting went ahead.
 
 Around 700 to 1,000 villagers attended the programme held by the Maoists of the East Division. The extremists decorated a column with red cloth and raised slogans. A red salute was given to comrades Charu Mazumdar and Kanhai Chatterjee and Maoists killed in the October encounter. The slogan, “All natural resources of the forest belong to tribals,” was raised. Red salutes were also given to Maoists who were killed at Rayagada, Gorrelametta, Kappatotti and Koraput.
 
 The leader of the Maoist squad alleged that the state government was suppressing the tribal agitation by deploying a massive police force. Youth in the villages were being branded as militia members and sympathizers of the CPI Maoist. A Maoist leader alleged that the police were illegally detaining the village youth weeks. There is also pressure on the youths to turn police informers.
 
 The Maoist leader alleged that tribals of Korukonda, GK Veedhi mandal, Mandapalli, Velamjuvvi and other interior villages were taken into custody by cops of Chintapalli, Annavaram and GK Veedhi. “The police are detaining youth and not informing their family,” he said. He said some tribal leaders were colluding with the mining mafia in the area and warned them of dire consequences. He alleged that Visakha Rural SP and Malkangiri SP were detaining innocent tribals.
