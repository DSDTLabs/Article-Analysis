GUWAHATI: Despite opposition by several organisations in  , the Centre has decided to grant citizenship to thousands of   and   in the state, but without tribal status in order to protect the rights of the indigenous people of the state. 

 The Chakma-Hajong refugee issue was discussed at a meeting of Union home minister Rajnath Singh, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister  , Union minister of state for home   and national security adviser Ajit Doval in Delhi on Wednesday.
 
 The Supreme Court had in 2015 directed the Centre and the state government to finalize the conferment of citizenship rights on eligible Chakmas and Hajongs. Soon after the meeting, Rijiju said, “The SC order has to be honoured. Chakmas have been settled in Arunachal Pradesh since 1964. But ST status and indigenous people’s rights won’t be diluted.” 
 
 He added that a “middle ground” would be chosen to protect the rights of the local population. The Chakma-Hajong population are also not likely to be given land ownership rights and may be given inner line permits, which non-locals in Arunachal need for travel and work. 
 
 The Chakmas and Hajongs were displaced from the area, which became part of East Pakistan (now in Bangladesh), after the construction of Kaptai Dam. They were allowed to be rehabilitated under the decision of the Centre in the 1960s. 
 
 The Chakmas, who are Buddhists, and Hajongs, who are Hindus, also allegedly faced religious persecution and entered India through what was then Lushai Hills district in Assam.
