Rajkot: Close to 200 house sparrows have died under mysterious circumstances in Malaniyad village near Halvad town of Morbi district since Saturday. Experts and veterinary doctors, who also saved around 52 sparrows, strongly suspect that the birds might have consumed wheat that was poisoned with some substance. 

 Dr Nitesh Naikpara, a veterinary doctor associated with the local bird helpline, told TOI that 148 sparrows were found dead on the fringes of village farms on Saturday while 27 that were ill were saved with medical intervention. On Sunday too, around 50 died while 25 were administered medicine and saved.
 
 Forest department officials were also informed about the sudden death of sparrows and those which were saved were handed over to their teams. Range forest officer, T N Dadhaniya, told TOI that they had released 27 sparrows after treatment near the lake in Halvad. “Prima facie it looks like they consumed poisoned grains,” he said.
 
 Mahesh Sindhav, who runs the bird helpline, said that sparrows, which are fast depleting, are seen in this village for many years now. “They get a conducive atmosphere here due to large number of fields, water and absence of any concrete structure or mobile towers.”
 
 Dadhaniya said another reason for sparrows found in large numbers in this area was proximity to the desert. "In winters, there are lot of insects, locally called as macchi, in the desert. This is the main food of sparrows, which is the reason why they are seen in such a huge number here."
 
 “We conducted postmortem of some dead sparrows and found whole wheat grains that were poisoned. Many times, farmers lace wheat with poisonous substance to keep wild boars and pigs at bay,” said Naikpara.
 
  On Sunday, the bird volunteers called a meeting of the villagers and gave them tips on saving ill sparrows. “We told them to administer water mixed with one drop of atropine and a drop of sodium bicarbonate powder to sparrows that are found ill,” added Naikpara.
