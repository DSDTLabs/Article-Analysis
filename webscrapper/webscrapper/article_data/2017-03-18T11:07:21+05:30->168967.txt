SURAT: Export shipments of polished diamonds worth hundreds of crores have been kept on hold for the last 25 days following a technical problem in the   (EDI) system of the customs at the Surat Hira Bourse (SHB). 

 The Gems and   (GJEPC) and the SHB authorities have strongly represented to the chief commissioner of customs in Ahmedabad to allow the manual clearance of high value diamonds, until the technical problem in the EDI system is not sorted out. 
 
 Official sources informed that the EDI system for the export of polished diamonds from SHB was launched from February 20. However, due to the technical problems in the EDI system software, the processing of the export shipments have been kept on hold from February 20, thereby forcing the diamantaires to take their goods at the Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB) at their own risk for the export.
 
 GJEPC officials said trade members have to complete their target of export before the completion of financial year and get their payments released as per the agreement with the international buyers. Holding the parcels by the customs is affecting the business cycle badly. 
 
 Talking to TOI, GJEPC’s regional chairman, Dinesh Navadiya said, “We have received many representations from the trade members regarding the holding of the parcels by the customs due to the technical faults in the EDI system. If the EDI system is not working, it is the lookout of the customs department. The entire trade in Surat is suffering due to the technical glitch. Thus, we have demanded that the export shipments be allowed through manual system.”
 
 The SHB, run by the Diamonds and   (DGDC), is handling import-export of diamonds to the tune of over Rs 70,000 crore per annum. Sources said diamond exporters have no other choice but to take risk of sending their parcels to BDB in Mumbai for export processing. In the last few days, around 20 high-value polished   have gone to Mumbai for export.
