MUMBAI: Advocate   on Thursday reiterated his stance as Taher Merchant’s defence advocate by stressing that the accused had played only a “menial role” and not one as a main conspirator in the 1993   bomb blasts. “Is he beyond reformation and cannot be assimilated into society? No,” said Pasbola. 

 He told the court to ask two questions before pronouncing a death sentence: “At what level the manMerchantwas among the conspirators?” and “Would his existence be a danger to society?” 
 
 He referred to the 2016 Supreme Court judgement against V Sriharan as well as those against Bachan Singh. “Merchant is an ordinary man and could not have made the final difference between good and bad”.
