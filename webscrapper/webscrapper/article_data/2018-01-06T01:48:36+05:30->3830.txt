NOIDA: The power supply remained disrupted in sectors 47,48 and parts of   in Sector 49 on Friday due to bifurcation and   of old oil circuit breakers (OCB) to new vacuum circuit breakers (VCB) in the 20 MVA substation of Sector 47.

 The upgrade will reduce the risk of breakage, blasts in case of heating up during peak season, thus adding to the supply benefit.
 
 “The power cut in sectors 47, 48 and half of Barola village was part of a planned outage to carry out the repair and bifurcation work from old oil circuit breakers to new vacuum circuit breakers in the substation of Sector 47.”
 
 “ We had intimated the RWAs of the sectors and take necessary permissions for it a couple of months back,” said P K Gautam, executive engineer, division 5, Paschimanchal   (PVVNL), who deployed a 30-member team with two contractors for this job.
 
 The repair and bifurcation work, which included 10 circuit breakers, panels and yard circuit breakers, began from 10am and was expected to be completed by 8pm. 
 
 Residents had made necessary arrangements of water and power back up as they were given prior intimation of the repair work.
 
 “Normally this kind of work takes about two-three days, but given the weather condition, we aimed to finish the work in 24 hours,” said Gautam.
