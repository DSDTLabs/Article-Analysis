NEW DELHI:   Delhi Municipal   is finding it difficult to   the alleged Rs 1,942.82 irregularities in the disbursement of pensions to former municipal employees.

  “In the last five days authorities have been able to verify only Rs 300 crore payments made between 2012 and 2016. The digital records before 2005 are not available. We are trying to check for the remaining Rs 1,642.82 crore also,” mayor Sanjeev Nayyar said on Tuesday.
 
 Nayyar, however, claimed that there were no irregularities from 2012 to 2016. “If there were any irregularities found before 2012, strict action will be taken,” he said.
 
 In one month the three corporations pay a total of Rs 31.93 crore as pension to 2,500 employees. North corporation was made the nodal agency for pension disbursement after the erstwhile MCD was trifurcated.
 
 To defend its image, the corporation obtained a letter from the chief auditor of the municipal accounts saying that it did not mention that the pensioners were alive or not.
 
 The audit report, however, said, “The banks have been furnishing statements made to the pensioners regularly, but the department did not carry out any verification to ascertain as to whether the remittance made by them tallied with their receipts/accounts and if the payments were made to the bonafide pensioners”.
 
 The corporation’s fault, the mayor accepted, was that it did not reply or take any action when the auditor red-flagged the matter in June 2015.
 
 The corporation has constituted a committee comprising officials from south and east corporations (besides north) to probe the authenticity of the payments.
