KOLKATA: All 42,900 candidates selected for appointment in state   after having cracked the   (TET) have to hold their breath for six more weeks for legal scrutiny. Calcutta high court on Wednesday made these appointments provisional, subject to the outcome of the court hearing in April. Now, selected candidates can join only if the recruitment procedure is upheld. 

 The court observed that the complaints regarding this were grave and serious. 
 
 Now, the   will mention the court's condition while issuing appointment letters to the selected candidates, said  , the council's chairperson. 
 
 The uncertainty prompted selected candidates to stage a dharna in front of the district council offices. "I worked hard to crack TET," said Nitin Biswas, who has been selected for a teaching post in Khidirpur FP School, Balurghat. "Now, it is the state government's responsibility to protect us and our jobs."
