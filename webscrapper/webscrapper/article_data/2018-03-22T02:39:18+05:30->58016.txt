NEW DELHI: Citing the repeated to and fro of files between Delhi government and the LG’s office, deputy CM Manish   during his speech on Outcome   said that there should be a mechanism to hold the lieutenant governor accountable for  .

 Sisodia also accused LG Anil Baijal for contributing to the delay in the establishment of the monitoring unit for Outcome Budget announced last year. He said just like there is a system to hold ministers and officers accountable for delays, the LG’s actions should also come on the record as he is also a part of the democratic system. There is no mention of how many times the LG returned a file and rejected it on “fictitious grounds”.
 
 “We had planned to establish a dedicated monitoring and redressal unit last year, which could make reviews easy,” the deputy CM said.
 
 He added that the true rewards of Outcome Budgeting will come only if this approach is institutionalised in day-to-day work of the government. He pointed out that the planning department has awarded the work of developing an IT application that will enable real-time monitoring of performance of various schemes and programmes.
 
 “The departments are adapting to the needs of monitoring and analysis of the programmes for Outcome Budget. The issues coming up in the process of monitoring are being tackled. A regular data collection and reporting mechanism is being established and strengthened. I firmly believe that the exercise of Outcome Budgeting will improve in due course of time and help in improving accountability and governance,” Sisodia added.
