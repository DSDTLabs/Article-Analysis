HYDERABAD: To avoid   to be laid in villages at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore, the state government has ordered officials to ensure that   is left on either side of the roads to allow pipelines to be laid as part of  .

 Chief secretary S P Singh also directed officials to provide underground ducts and passages wherever pipelines have to cross the roads. Singh holds full additional charge as special chief secretary of the panchayat raj and rural development department.
 
 The state government had issued guidelines for construction of cement concrete (CC) roads without drains in rural areas under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Priority will be given to SCST localities and 20% of the cost will be covered with funds with the gram panchayat or MPLAD scheme.
 
 With the engineer-in-chief of the panchayat raj department stating that the new cement roads need not be very thick as vehicular traffic is less in rural areas, the state government allowed it with the rider that proper curing of the road should be done for a minimum of 28 days. However, it specified that the thickness should be as per the recommendations of the Indian Road Congress manual on any village road that is part of a main link road or any internal road that is likely to have high traffic in view of local developmental parameters.
 
 To avoid any damage to these CC roads in view of the ongoing Mission Bhagiratha project, in which water supply pipelines are being laid, the chief secretary said that ducts and conduits made of reinforced cement concrete should be provided at junctions and crossings in consultation with the rural water supply department and the gram panchayat.
 
 Conduits of diameter ranging from 200mm to 450 mm should be provided at locations (as per the approved pipeline layout) to accommodate intra village water pipelines and connections to individual houses without cutting the CC road.
