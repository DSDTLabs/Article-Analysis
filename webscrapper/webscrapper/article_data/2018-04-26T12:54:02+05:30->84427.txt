On Wednesday, as the civic body launched an eviction drive on about seven streets around  , encroachments that were removed last year were seen at the same spots.

 Ahead of the festivals scheduled in   temple in Rockfort, including a temple car event in the coming week, the civic body removed 72 shops encroaching NSB road, Nandhikoil Street, Andal street and Chinnakadai Veedhi. Majority of the encroachments had illegally made use of pedestrian platforms covering the open storm water drainage canals. “Tea stalls and food outlets were seen placing stoves over the pedestrian platform and customers were seen parking vehicles on the roads. Even after the temple festival, we have planned to keep a check on the shops in the congested stretches,” a senior official with the corporation said. Out of 25 feet wide motorable space of the arterial roads around Rockfort, about six to eight feet of the roads were found encroached by the commercial establishments.
 
 As removal of encroachments and them returning to the same spot after a brief period of time has been happening in loop, corporation officials said that they are planning to seize the properties of encroachers. “The seized properties will be given back only after the defaulter pays penalty which may go up to Rs 10,000,” the official added. Residents claimed traffic congestion in and around Rockfort was said to be happening because of of heavy vehicles and have sought a solution to prevent it entering city during peak hours.
