HYDERABAD: A major hurdle for establishing   in the city is not money, but choosing a location. "Everyone wants public toilets in the city, but no one wants washrooms to be constructed near their house or workplace,"   (GHMC) commissioner   said at a corporation meeting on Thursday. 

 It was after fighting the odds that the civic body set up 10 she-toilets, eight of which are in use, the commissioner said. The GHMC is now planning to set up another 50 toilets with the help of several   that have agreed to do so as part of their corporate social responsibility. But they are facing the problem of locating the toilets.
 
 She toilets for women are equipped with auto flush, sanitary napkin vending machines and napkin incinerators. But most women are unaware of this facility due to lack of publicity and signages. "There should be signage and boards even in lanes adjacent to the washrooms to easily identify it," said a woman from the city.
 
 Hyderabad has 435 public toilets for one crore people and authorities are trying to install 900 more. According to the guidelines of  , there should be one public toilet for every 25 women and 50 men. As of now, 5 crore has been sanctioned to set up 100 modern pre-fabricated toilets.
