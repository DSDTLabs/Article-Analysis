HYDERABAD: Amidst alleged death threats to social activist and writer Kancha   over his book, TRS MLA from   Urban constituency,   has demanded Ilaiah to withdraw his book from the market immediately as it was in bad taste.“I have asked the people of my community who approached me not to make a hero out of Kancha Ilaiah. He does not deserve the attention that he is seeking by writing ill about Vysyas," Bigala told TOI.

 Ganesh Bigala also found fault with the printer and publisher for bringing out the book. “The book does not serve any purpose and is not in national interest. Why should it have been printed at all?“ the MLA said about the book “Samajika Smuggleru Komatollu".
 
  community leaders who felt offended by Kancha Ilaiah's negative remarks about the community have planned to hold state-wide protests against Ilaiah.
 
 “When he wrote a similar book against Brahmins, Ilaiah got no response. He was practically ignored. Even now, he needs to be completely ignored,“ Ganesh Bigala said.
 
 Some of the Vysya community leaders have explored options about taking legal action against Kancha Ilaiah. While this will take place, Ganesh Bigala has suggested that it would not be advisable to take to the roads against Kancha Ilaiah when he should not be taken seriously .
 
 “My demand is that he should withdraw his remarks against the community and also the book. We leave it to his wis dom on how he responds to our demand,“ Ganesh Bigala said.
 
 The MLA said any ordinary citizen would condemn such writings whether he belonged to that community of people or not whom Kancha Ilaiah targeted. He said the language that Kancha Ilaiah used was hurting to the community .
 
 “He should realise that the community is the first to render help during   or providing help to people at other times. He should apologise for all that he has said against the community ,“ Ganesh Bigala said.
