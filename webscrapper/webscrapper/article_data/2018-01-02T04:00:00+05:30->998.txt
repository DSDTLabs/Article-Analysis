Rajkot: The streets wore a deserted look and shops downed their shutters in Dhrangadhra, as this town of Surendranagar district observed a complete bandh on Monday.  The bandh was called by Dhrangadhra Vepari Mandal against the increasing menace of anti-social elements in the town.  “The incidents of anti-social elements attacking traders, harassing them, extorting money from them and vandalizing their business establishments are on the rise. We demand that a strict disciplinarian cop be appointed in Dhrangadhra to curb this menace,” said mandal president Bharat Vyas.  Vyas cited two recent instances of robberies and attack. On Saturday, Dinesh Nanjibhai, a cloth merchant, was stabbed by two assailants who robbed him of Rs 5,200 cash in Dhrangadhra. Dharmendra Single and a minor were arrested for the crime.  Apart from the robbery and stabbing, the arrested minor faces the charges of abduction and rape of a minor girl and bootlegging.  “That apart, some 10 days ago, Bhavesh Soni, who has a jewellery shop near Ram Mahel in Dhrangadhra, was attacked by an anti-social element who wanted to extort money from him,” said Vyas.  The agitating traders submitted a memorandum with their demands to superintendent of police and sent it to the state home minister as well.
