PATNA: The JD (U) on Wednesday took a dig at PM  , saying he should also make “surgical strikes” to end raging unemployment and farmers’ suicides in the country. The party also demanded that the   should break its silence on Bihar’s demand for the grant of special category status to the state.

 JD(U) spokesman   said Bihar is one of the few states in the country where farmers are not committing suicide. “This proves that the state government’s schemes for the farmers have been quite effective. CM   has been addressing the farmers’ problems proactively,” Neeraj said.
 
 Neeraj said the BJP functionaries have maintained silence on the failure of the Centre to grant special category status to Bihar. “The saffron party netas often claim that the Centre will implement the Rs 1.25 lakh crore special package that PM Narendra Modi had announced in the run up to 2015 assembly election in the state. Their claims that special package amount has already been included in allotment of various central schemes for the state are false,” Neeraj said, adding there is no connection of the special package amount with the money that is to be released to the state over five years as part of various central schemes.
