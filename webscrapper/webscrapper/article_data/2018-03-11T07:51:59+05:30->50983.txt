HYDERABAD: As water level at   reservoir is fast dipping, officials of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) have swung into action to set up a temporary pumping station at   village of   district, to pump Krishna water from the reservoir.

 The water level recorded on Friday at Nagarjunasagar reservoir was 520 feet. Irrigation and Command Area Development (I&CAD) department has permitted the   to draw water up to 510 feet. “By April first week, the water level will reach 510 feet,” according to a senior irrigation department official.
 As a result, the irrigation department has alerted the Water Board two months before prime summer to enable it to make alternate arrangements like setting up a pumping station at Puttamgandi, the main tapping point to supply Krishna water to over 9.30 lakh consumers in Hyderabad.
 
 Estimations for the emergency pumps have been prepared. The total cost is estimated at ?5 crore. Soon tenders will be invited for the project. Works pertaining to emergency pumps will be completed by the first week of April, according to HMWSSB director (revenue) B  . The water board will abide by the instructions of the irrigation department on maintaining water level up to 510 feet. The board can draw water even up to 500 feet through emergency pumps, he said.
 
 The board assures that 270 million gallons of water per day (MGD) of Krishna water will be supplied to the city even if water level goes down to 500 feet. If the situation turns worse, the board will draw 10 million gallons of water per day (MGD) from Osmansagar reservoir and another 15 MGD from Manjira. Before drawing water from Manjira, the board will approach the state government for permission as Manjira water was allotted for Mission Bhageeratha, said the official.
 
 “There will be no interruption in water supply till the onset of monsoon. The water board will maintain supply of 420 MGD to consumers,” said another senior HMWSSB official.
