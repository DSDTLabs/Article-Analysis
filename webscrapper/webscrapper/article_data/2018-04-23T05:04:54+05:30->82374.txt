 MUMBAI: A day after a 7-year-old girl from south Mumbai fell off a horse in Matheran, doctors at   said that the girl’s condition was better and she was moved out intensive care and into the children’s ward on Sunday evening.   suffered a brain injury in which there is collection of blood between the surface of the brain and the skull.

 “The brain injury will resolve on its own without any surgical intervention. Her other injuries too are not major in nature,” said a doctor from the hospital.
 
 Rasheeda has sustained injuries to the brain besides suffering a blood-clot and fracture in the skull. The girl has been kept on a liquid diet.
 
 At the hill station though, horse riders continued to take tourists on rides without any safety gear.
 
 Rasheeda’s uncle   alleged that the horse went berserk after its handler tried to tickle and tease it.
 
 The girl got trapped in the saddle and the horse trotted about 50 feet ahead and the rider was unable to control it, said the uncle. The girl’s family alleged that the horse rider had taken another girl on a ride minutes after the accident.
 
 Assistant inspector   of Matheran police station said that they are still to record the statements of the child’s family members.
