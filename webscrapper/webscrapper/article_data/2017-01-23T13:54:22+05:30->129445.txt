PATNA: In an extremely rare case, a girl child was born with almost no skin at Paliganj primary health centre (PHC) on Saturday. Doctors said it was a case of  , a severe genetic disorder which leaves the entire body encased in armour-like thick white plates, separated by deep cracks. Harlequin Ichthyosis, which affects approximately 1 in 300,000 births, requires intensive care at birth.

 Deputy superintendent of Paliganj sub-divisional hospital Dr Shiv Lal Chaudhary, who is also in charge of Paliganj PHC, said the baby was born around 6am on Saturday and it was a case of normal delivery. However, it was a pre-mature birth as the baby was born after 32 weeks, instead of 36 weeks.
 
 “There was no problem during the delivery of the baby. The baby, who weighed around 2.50kg, even cried after her birth. We sent a child specialist to her home on Sunday and he reported that she was drinking milk. However, we have referred her to   and Hospital,” Dr Chaudhary said.
 
 A large number of people thronged the house of Mohammad Rahman at   in Paliganj to see the ‘unnatural’ baby. Rahman, the father of the newborn, owns a shoe shop in Paliganj. His elder daughter is one-and-a-half-year-old.
 
 A doctor said this is probably just the second reported case of Harlequin Ichthyosis in India. The first case in the country was reported in June last year when a woman gave birth to a child with Harlequin Ichthyosis at   in Nagpur. The baby survived for just 48 hours.
 
 “Such infants are prone to various infections because skin is not there to protect them,” said Dr A A Hai of Patna, adding that survival has also been reported in certain cases.
