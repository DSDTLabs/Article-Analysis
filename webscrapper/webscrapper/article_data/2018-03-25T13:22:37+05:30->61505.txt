CHARMINAR: Lack of sufficient employment opportunities in the   is forcing several women to stay in abusive relationships or take up ill-paying work to make ends meet.

 Though several women earn degrees higher than the men in their families, they are either unable to find work in the area or are forced to let go of opportunities in the IT companies that are housed very far in the western part of the city.
 
 “Our families have been working in small businesses such as the bangle making shops at   or textile shops near   for ages. We want to bring an end to that life because there is a lot of exploitation in these jobs,” said  , a resident of Old City.
 
 “There is poverty and rampant child labour, especially in the bangle making industry. This can only be controlled if girls are educated and are offered good jobs,” she said.
 
 Many women even end up staying in abusive relationships and are married off at a very young age, say activists.
 
 “We have rescued a lot of women from abusive marriages. The reason many do not raise their voice against this is because they have no job to manage on their own,” said  , an activist working for women empowerment.
