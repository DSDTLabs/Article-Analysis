We’ve heard of actors driving, flying, sailing to and even hiking and trekking through tough terrains for their shoots. Interestingly, the team of ' ' had to raft to their location in   for picturising the song, Subah Subah.
After filming a portion of the track in various parts of the holy town, director   wanted to shoot  ,   and   rafting and also some scenes on the  . However, they were too hard pressed for time to drive from one location to another. So, the director, his main crew and the actors decided to get adventurous and raft the distance of a dozen-odd kilometres. To their surprise, they reached the destination in record time.
 Luv recalls, “When the production drivers tell you that there’s no way to reach the location in 60 minutes, and the   instructors boast that they can do so in half the time, all you need is like-minded, adventurous actors who would be willing to take the road less travelled. The ride was bumpy, but we made it in 25 minutes.”
