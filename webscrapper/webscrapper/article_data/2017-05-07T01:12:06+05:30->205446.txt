NEW DELHI: Delhi University has finalised the   for   under   for the 2017-18 academic year. 

 The admission will be based on 60% weightage to sports trials and 40% to certificates. However, admission dates are yet to be finalised and the final decision rests with the university vice chancellor.
 
 As reported by TOI earlier, there will be no “fitness test” — the qualifying test for sports trials. Instead there will be a sport-specific fitness test within the centralised sports trials. All aspirants will now be eligible for the trials.
 
 According to the admission policy sports trials will include game/ sport specific fitness, fundamental skills and overall playing ability. The   Sports Council (DUSC) will identify and allocate college/s to conduct specific trials. To be eligible for admission, the candidates must score at least 30 out of 60 marks. 
 
 There will be two categories of admissions — direct and trial-based. Candidates who have represented India in the mentioned competition(s), recognised and funded by the ministry of youth affairs and sports will be eligible for direct admission. All candidates have to upload self-attested copy of the “highest sports certificate”. Under the trial-based admission, only those certificates that were issued between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2017 will be valid.
 
 The university will also issue a list of the certificates/ events which will be considered valid. The online application process will have a menu from which one can choose the tournaments for which one has been certified. The DUSC has also created a matrix for marks assigned to various certificates as well as achievements.
 
 For example, anyone who participated in world/ Asian School Games/ other international competitions and stood first will get full 40 marks, followed by 39 and 38 for the second and third positions respectively. And simple participation will earn 37 marks.
