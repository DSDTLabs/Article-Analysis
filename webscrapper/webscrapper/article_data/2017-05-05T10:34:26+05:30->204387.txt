HYDERABAD: To keep  , Warangal rural collector   is getting 15,000 trenches dug and 50,000   in the   in the district. 

 Each trench is three by one metre in dimension and one metre in depth. The idea is not only to protect 12,000 hectares of degraded forest area, which land sharks are eyeing, but also to rejuvenate the forest.
 
 The collector said that it was observed that over the last two or three decades, some 2,000 acres of forest land had been converted into agricultural land by encroachers.
 
 The already encroached upon land will be demarcated and also notified that it is forest land. Buying and selling of that land will then become difficult. The challenge now is to protect the 12,000 hectares of reserve forest area which looks almost barren. As this would give scope to land sharks to grab this land too, the collector has begun digging huge trenches everywhere in the degraded forest area.
 
 "During the monsoon, the trenches would be filled with rain water and the forest area would be rejuvenated. In all 50,000 teak trees will be planted in the trenches and also around them," Patil told TOI on Thursday. Two trees will be planted in a trench and another three on the excavated earth around it. The trenches will help soil and water conservation and also in the afforestation plan.
 
 Considering that the reserve forest area is close to Pakhal lake in the Pakhal wildlife sanctuary, land sharks have been eyeing the degraded forest cover. The digging of the trenches is expected to keep them at bay while the forest cover will be restored at the same time.
 
 Asked if the already encroached upon forest land would be taken over by the government, the collector said the primary task would be to see that the encroached lands are not sold off.
