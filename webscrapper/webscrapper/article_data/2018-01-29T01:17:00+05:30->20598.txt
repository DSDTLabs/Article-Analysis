New Delhi: At the eleventh hour of Delhi University’s Executive Council (EC) meeting, several teachers have raised concern over the “absence of certain agenda issues”. The members claim that issues like poor research situation in the university, revised pay scales and others are “surprisingly absent”, and attempts at creating a new post seems to be the only focus.

 In a letter to the vice-chancellor, EC member AK Bhagi on Saturday said, “There are many pressing issues which the university is facing but to my surprise the agenda of the EC meeting finds no mention of them.”
 
 He mentioned the need for discussions on the “librarian status as academic staff as per UGC regulations, and the recent MHRD and UGC issued notification of revised pay scales of university teachers and other employees.”
 
 According to Bhagi, the meeting, which is taking place after six months, seems to be focused on creating the post of a new director of North Campus, similar to the existing director of South Campus.
 
 “Despite the statutes, the university has been unable to find a suitable person for the post of the Pro-VC, which for almost two years is held by a person with dual charges,” he said.
 
 The EC member also alleged that the function of the new director’s post overlaps with the post of dean of college and PVC, which will “add to the bureaucratic red-tape.”
 
 Another EC member concerned about poor research facilities due to stringent finance rules claimed that in last meeting of the EC, a visitor nominee suggested that the elected members and team members should hold a preparatory meeting. The meeting would decide the agenda of EC. “No such meeting was called for and the agenda item came to our knowledge without any discussion or our suggestions,” complained EC member Rajesh Jha.
