GURUGRAM: Thieves in the guise of   have struck again. This time around, their victim was a retired Army colonel. 

 Two women, posing as domestic helps, allegedly stole valuables from retired colonel Mahabir Singh Gulia’s house in Sector 23 on Wednesday. 
 
 The two women arrived at Gulia’s home in the afternoon, seeking work. They identified themselves as Radha and Aarti. The colonel’s wife, who had been looking for a domestic help, was only too happy to see them and asked them to start work immediately, without making any enquiries.
 
 Within an hour of cleaning up the drawing room, they sought the wife’s permission to go to the second floor of the house to use the washroom. From there, they stole silver idols and other valuables from a shrine inside the house, and fled. 
 
  filed a complaint against the duo at Palam Vihar police station, following which, an FIR was registered against them under Section 381 (theft by servant) of IPC. 
 
 Similar incidents have happened in Gurgaon in the past, where thieves have used the same modus operandi to commit crimes. But, when such robberies are such a common occurrence, why don’t residents follow procedure, and get a maid’s credentials verified by police before hiring them?
 
 “A good maid is difficult to come by in Gurgaon. So the moment you get one, you are in sucha hurry to hire her . Besides, going to the police station is a hassle,” said Rajni Nasa, a resident of Sector 5.
 
 “In the name of police verification, we fill a form at the police station and hardly ever hear back from the police. The last time I did this, the maid was so offended that she left me in lurch, said  , a resident of DLF-2.
 
 The police, too, continue to be passive spectators. “To curb the recurring menace, we can only try to create more awareness among residents, to get domestic helps verified before hiring them” said  , commissioner of police, Gurgaon.
