THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   here will pronounce the judgment on the discharge petitions filed by the three accused in sensational Sister Abhaya murder case on Tuesday. The court had initially scheduled the judgment for Thursday. 

 The judge had heard the pleas of the three accused- Father Thomas Kottoor, Father   and Sister Sephy-in the past two weeks. They maintained that the case against them was fabricated and the investigators did not have any concrete evidence to incriminate them in the case.
 
 The prosecution had, however, dismissed their arguments and stated that the probe team had collected not just valid evidence but also had crucial witness statements against the accused.
 
 The discharge petitions were filed in March 2011.
