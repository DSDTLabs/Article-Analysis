JAIPUR: At a time when the city police are facing staff shortage, increasing number of false cases continue to keep the police on their toes. The Jaipur police’s east zone registered total 33 cases of murder in 2017, of which 17 cases turned out to be false, compelling police to file a Final Report (FR) to close the case which was initially registered as murder. In 2016, the east zone registered total 35 cases of murders. However, the sustained investigation, and examination of evidence led to police finding out that 15 of these cases were false.

 
 “Often in suicide cases or natural deaths the relatives insist on filing case under section 302 (murder), however, our teams investigate such matters at length, only to find out that there was evidence indicating that it was a murder,” said deputy commissioner of police (East) Kunwar Rastradeep. 
 
 The number of false cases also takes toll on the efficiency of the police stations. “There is a staff of about 17 to 30 people at a police station in the city, but only five to six investigation officers (IO). These IOs have to investigate scores of cases and these false matters are an extra burden which leads to pendency,” the official told TOI.
 
 
 
 Giving an example, the official said that there was a case a few months ago in   where a youth was found dead. The relatives filed a case of murder and the police team then spent months to investigate the matter, only to find that it was a false case.
 
 
 “Of the 35 cases of 17 cases are found out to be false. It means that only 16 cases were true, so the 50 percent cases were false. We have to take every case as genuine and spend time and resources to investigate it,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
