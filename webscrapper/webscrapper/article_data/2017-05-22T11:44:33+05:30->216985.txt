Actress   said the future of older actresses looks secure but the film industry still has a long way to go. 
The ' ' star, who started her TV career playing a barmaid in ITV soap ' ', said she is lucky to have got two of her best roles in late 40s.
 
 "Two of the best roles I've ever had have happened in my late 40s. I'm 53 this year. It started at 49 with Tango in Halifax and then Happy Valley. I can't complain at a time when most actors are disappearing. I seem to have become very visible. 
 
 "Age affects us all in the workplace. We all get a little less appealing as we get older, unfortunately. We should gather strength from the fact that the climate is looking very promising for women. But it's very early days, and too soon to celebrate,"   said.
