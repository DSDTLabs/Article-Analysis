“Trust   to come up with something like this” – that’s how   described the ace cinematographer turned director’s latest tech to film his upcoming movie  .

 Sujith along with his team have come up with a unique and cost effective measure to film Autorsha, a movie which has most of its scenes shot inside a moving  .
 
 Sujit had shared on his social media post, “We have brought you something very peculiar that has not exemplified before. Introducing the Autorsha 360. Capturing minute and complex movements in between journeys was an intricate task to overcome with. So we built a multi axis rolling rig structure around the vehicle where the camera is connected through a gimbal for that freeflow throughout 360 degrees. The circling axis installs life-like perception into every scenes by keeping it more real than ever. 
 Being inventive rather than deceptive is how we percieve cinema to reality (sic).”
 
 The movie has   in the lead playing the role of an autorickshaw driver.
