Vadodara: The fake deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and a fake sub-inspector of National Investigative Agency (NIA), who were brought to city on a transfer warrant by Karelibaug police were sent to judicial custody on Thursday.

 Raj Vyas and Vikramsinh Rajput were booked for cheating Ravi Gurjar, a resident of Chhota Udepur, by promising him a job in ONGC at Hazira in Surat. The duo were earlier arrested by the local crime branch (LCB) and special operations group (SOG) of Mahisagar police for looting a shopkeeper and possessing fake identity cards of police, fire services and NIA.
 
 The police said that along with Gurjar, various other persons were duped but they have not come forward to register their complaints. But, it has been learnt by the police that the duo have taken Rs 13.60 lakh by many job seekers including Gurjar. “Of the extorted amount, Rajput had paid Rs 3.5 lakh as deposit amount to take a shop in Seven Seas Mall in Fatehgunj as rent. He has also told us that he had even bought a car from that money,” said a police official.
 
 Police wanted to take the duo to Surat for investigations to Surat and had sought their further remand for five days but, the court rejected the police’s application and sent them to Vadodara Central Jail. The city police had arrested them on February 24 and had received their remand for seven days.
