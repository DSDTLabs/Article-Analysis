MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday came to the aid of a Solapur resident, whose job claim was rejected by the   because he had a tattoo on his forearm.

 A division bench of justices R M Borde and   held that as the tattoo would not interfere with the petitioner's official duties, and as he had met all other  , the CISF must make an exception to their rules for him. Also, as the tattoo was of a religious symbol, the bench held that petitioner  's religious sentiments must be respected.
 
 Pakhare had applied for the post of constable-cum-driver with the CISF. While he cleared the requisite test and medical examination, he was denied the job on account of a tattoo on his right forearm. As per CISF rules, tatoos are not allowed.
 
 Pakhare said he tried to remove the tattoo surgically, but failed to have it removed completely. He moved the court for relief, arguing that as the Army makes exception for those who have tattoos depicting religious symbols, the CISF be directed to do the same. He also pointed out that a recent CISF circular, calling for applications for the post of senior inspector, said that   were permissible if theyâ€™re small in size.
