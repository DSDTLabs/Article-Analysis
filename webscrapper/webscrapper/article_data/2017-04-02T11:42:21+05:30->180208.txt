LAHORE: Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz   was briefly hospitalised after he was diagnosed with a 'small stone' in his kidney.

 Sharif's daughter   confirmed that he went to a private hospital here for a medical check-up, but criticised those who were spreading rumours about her father's illness.
 
 "As opposed to the sensational news on media, PM is Alhamdolillah (by grace of Allah) fine. Diagnosed with small kidney stone that doesn't need any intervention," she tweeted.
 
 67-year-old Sharif underwent a   (CT) scan following a minor stomachache. Doctors, following the scan, confirmed presence of a stone in his left kidney.
 
 "On Saturday morning, the premier felt pain in his kidneys and was rushed to a private hospital in Gulberg where doctors thoroughly examined him for more than half an hour. After a CT scan they detected a small stone in his left kidney," the Dawn quoted a source in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as saying.
 
 After a brief stay doctors allowed Sharif to go home and suggested observing certain dietary schedule.
 
 "In case the stone does not come out by taking water a procedure may be carried out," an official quoted a doctor as saying.
 
 In May 2016, Sharif had undergone a successful open-heart surgery in London.
 
 Meanwhile, Minister of State for Information Maryam Aurangzeb said Prime Minister Sharif was fine, as all medical tests were satisfactory.
 
 "The Prime Minister has been working tirelessly as he wants to see completion of all projects by 2018, hence, he was under some stress," Aurangzeb said.
 
 It is the second time in a year that Sharif faced health issues. Last year in May, he underwent an open-heart surgery in London.
