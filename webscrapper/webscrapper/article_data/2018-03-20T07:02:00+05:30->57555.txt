GHAZIABAD: A 26-year-old   working with taxi aggregator Uber died of electrocution on Sunday evening while cleaning his car with a vacuum cleaner.

  The victim, identified as Rajesh Rai, was rushed to a nearby hospital, but was declared dead on arrival.
 
 A relative of Rajesh said his nephew had suffered an   shock as the cable of vacuum cleaner had been chewed by rats at several places.
 
 The electrocution took place at Rai’s house located at Rahul Vihar Phase 1 around 5pm. “Rajesh, who had worked with a private firm earlier, had got his   registered under Uber sometime ago,” said Lallan Kumar Rai, the maternal uncle of Rajesh.
 
 “He was cleaning the vehicle in front of his house while his elder brother Rakesh was sitting nearby. Suddenly, Rakesh noticed that froth was coming out from his brother’s mouth. He immediately asked his mother to put the switch off,” added Lallan Kumar Rai.
 
 “However, he could not understand and then Rakesh rushed inside and removed the plug from the socket,” he said.
 
 “As soon as the plug was removed, Rajesh fell to the ground and became unconscious. He was rushed to a nearby hospital but the staff refused to admit him, saying they did not have the facility to treat patients who had suffered electrocution. From there, he was taken to another private hospital which declared him brought dead,” added Lallan.
 
 A native of Madhubani district in Bihar, Rajesh got married in December 2017.
 
 The SHO of Vijay Nagar police station, Naresh Kumar Singh, said the police had not received any complaint in the matter.
