SHIMLA: Bharatiya Janata Party-backed   ( ) members launched a protest demonstration in   (HPU) on Monday alleging that even in four years of governance of Congress party, around 20 lakh educated youths in state are unemployed and state government has also failed to provide them an unemployment allowance.

 Amit Thakur, ABVP state president, said they have found out that in 70 employment exchange offices under state government, there are around 8.29 lakh registrations of unemployed youths and in the non-government offices, the number is 13.5 lakh. “In this global era when job opportunities are increasing, Himachal is lagging behind in the race of becoming self-reliant,” he added.
 
 HPU ABVP unit secretary Pradeep Sharma said the state is educating lakhs but where does this youth go after completing their masters or PhD. “Due to lack of employment in state, they either move to other states or are forced to sit at home to wait for opportunities. So, they must be provided unemployment allowances till they find a betters source of income. For this situation, the state government is responsible which is not forming a strong policy for them,” he added.
 
 ABVP also handed over memorandum of students demands to HPU vice-chancellor and to the dean of students welfare, demanding to demolish semester system of   to make it an annual system again, roll back the decision of banning students elections, make adequate changes in HPU hostels by speeding up the renovation work and provide basic facilities to hostellers such as adequate water supply, cleanliness and security.
