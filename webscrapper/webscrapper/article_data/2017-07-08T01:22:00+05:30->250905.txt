Dharmapuri: The National Highways Authority of India ( ) has sent a proposal to the Central government seeking Rs 114 crore to lay a new   at   on Salem-Bangalore national highway. The project is expected to check accidents in the busy stretch.

 Thousands of vehicles, including trucks, use the 3.5 km stretch a day to reach Kerala via Coimbatore or Kanyakumari. It is also a popular route to the northern and western parts of India.
 
 According to NHAI officials, on an average, 13 accidents take place a month on the ghat road. They blamed rash driving for the accidents. “Most of the trucks are loaded with goods more than the stipulated weight. They topple while crossing the hairpin bends at the ghat road,” a NHAI official told TOI.
 
 To check such incidents, NHAI and the Dharmapuri district administration had jointly conducted a field study, which identified accident prone spots. The district administration then approached the forest department to allocate land to lay the new road, which will eliminate hairpin bends.
 
 “We have decided to lay the new road without hairpin bends and sharp curves,” the official said. The road will be 60 ft wide with centre median. It will start from Kattamedu, the entry point of Thoppur ghat road and end at Thoppur village.
 
 NHAI also plans to save trees that have to be cut down for the road expansion work. “We will uproot trees using earthmovers and will plant them in the nearby forest,” the official said.
 
 “We hope the Central government will release the fund in a couple of months,” he added.
