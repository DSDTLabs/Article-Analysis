Mangaluru: The Mumbai police have arrested a Bajrang Dal activist on charges of kidnapping a girl, who had allegedly eloped with a man from another community. The arrested is Sunil Pumpwell.

 According to Mangaluru police, Sunil Pumpwell, an auto-rickshaw driver, was picked by Mumbai police in the city on Thursday. He had brought the victim and her parents from Mumbai to Mangaluru in a four-wheeler. The husband of the victim alleged that his wife was abducted from Mumbai. He also filed a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court seeking directions to the Mumbai commissioner of police and the Mangaluru police to produce his wife in court and decide if she will stay with him or her parents.
 
 Meanwhile, the saffron chauvinists had alleged this is as ‘Love Jihad’ case and also approached the union minister to intervene on the issue.
 
 Mohammed Iqbal Choudary, husband of the city-based law student had met her on social media and became friends. Over the years, they fell in love and married in July this year. She had eloped and married. Meanwhile, she had also submitted an affidavit at jurisdictional police station stating that she eloped with her own willingness and was not forced by anyone, police sources said. 
 
 Earlier this month, the Mumbai police had arrived in Mangaluru in search of the girl but they did not find her and had left to Kasaragod, her native. She was staying in Mangaluru in a rented house under Mangaluru East police station limits. She is the daughter of a prominent leader of a Hindutva group.
 
 Earlier, the saffron outfit members had submitted a memorandum to defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman against such cases during her recent visit to the coastal city.
