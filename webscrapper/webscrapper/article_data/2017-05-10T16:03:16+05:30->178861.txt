The hot weather demands you to take extra care of your skin. With the new season, one should also change the skin care routine and products. As in winters, you may slather heavy duty creams, but summer demands extra protection from the sun and few cooling products. 

 
 
 
 Here’s a list of 5   you need right now:
 
 
 
 
 
 While you cover your face with a pair sunglasses and hat, your body might get tortured in the sunny days. The hot summer can make your feet sweaty, smelly and vulnerable to infection. Also, flats can make your feet extra dry and tired in summers. To combat odour and refresh your feet, use a cooling foot spray.

 Who doesn’t love to splash some water on their face in the sweltering summer? And that’s why you need a face mist in your bag, so you can refresh anytime during the day! Rosewater face mist is the best pick for summers. It is refreshing and as rose is anti-inflammatory, it helps to soothe the heat induced irritation.

 The one product that you need in your beauty first aid kid is aloe gel. From sun burns to rashes, aloe gel can help to calm down redness and irritation.

 Sweat patches on your shirts can be a major faux pas. A good antiperspirant or deodorant can keep the odour away and control excess sweating. Apply it on your underarms, back of the knees and even your décolletage.

 There’s no question on how important sunscreen is for summers. Make sure you apply the sunscreen 15 minutes before you head out. This helps the sunscreen to get absorbed better and protect from the harmful sun rays.
