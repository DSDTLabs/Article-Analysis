PANAJI: While encouraging people to donate their organs and body, doctors on Friday also said that it was vital to discuss such a decision with family members and to obtain their consent.

 Addressing a gathering at   beach, oncologist Dr Shekhar Salkar stressed that it was important to inform family members about one’s wish to donate organs or their body after death.
 
 “It becomes difficult to get consent from family members after death if they are not informed. So please don’t forget to talk to your family about your desire to donate your organs,” Salkar said.
 
 The Federation of   and Body Donation along with   of Panaji organised an awareness march from Kala Academy to Miramar beach to promote organ donation in Goa. 
 
 The   and Body Donation organised a walkathon from Mumbai to   to encourage the practice and also to dispel superstitious beliefs surrounding the practice.
 
 “This is the need of the hour. Organ donation is an opportunity to do something even after death,” said president of Goa Red Cross Gaurish Dhond.
 
 Salkar did clarify that for organs such as kidneys and liver to be donated, it was vital for the patient to be hospitalized before death. 
 
 A day earlier, the members of the Federation of Organ and Body Donation held a public meeting in Mapusa. After their stopover in Panaji, the members, who have been walking for 21 days, will walk 32km to reach Margao where they will hold a similar programme.
