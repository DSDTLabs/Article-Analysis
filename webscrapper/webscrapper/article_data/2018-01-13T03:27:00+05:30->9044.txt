Visakhapatnam: The stage looks set for   at various places across the coastal districts of the state, particularly after the Supreme Court’s latest order on the issue on Friday.

 But even before the apex court’s decision, organisers and punters in coastal  , especially from Krishna, Guntur and the two Godavari districts, had begun preparing the arenas and even allegedly held auctions for liquor, gambling and other games where money is involved such as Gundata.
 
 It may be recalled that BJP leader Raghurama Krishnam Raju had approached the Supreme Court against the Hyderabad High Court’s order where it asked for a complete ban on cockfights in the state. But the apex court refused to vacate its earlier order on the issue and asked the petitioner to approach the HC for a modification of its earlier order.
 
 For the coming Sankranti festival, punters expect the betting amount to cross Rs 700 crore this year as big businessmen, especially aqua farmers, politicians and other celebrities are likely to witness the cockfights.
 
 Rs 2,000 denomination notes will be in big demand at the major arenas because of the huge amounts at stake. Ram Prasad, a punter from Rajahmundry, said money flow would be more this year as people with deep pockets have not deposited income from fish or shrimp farming, or real estate, in banks.
 
 East Godavari SP Vishal Gunnit told TOI they have already registered 128 cases against punters and organisers. “Our men are keeping a close watch on known cockfight arenas and organisers, and also on the new arenas likely to spring up this year. We have already served notices to the organisers of old and notorious arenas,” ishal Gunni said.
