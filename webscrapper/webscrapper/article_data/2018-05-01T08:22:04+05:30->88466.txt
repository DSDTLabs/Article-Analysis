KOLKATA: In a bid to prevent road accidents,   ( ) has decided to install two 2.8-metre (9 feet) high secondary barriers in front of the primary height barriers on both ends of the   that connects EM Bypass with VIP Road.   ( ), meanwhile, plans to replace the bamboo fences on the road dividers in New Town with ‘smart urban railings’. Permanent steel fence will be installed to prevent jaywalking.

 The primary height barrrier is about 3.6metre high.
 
 Only a few weeks ago, a speeding heavy vehicle had crashed into the primary height barrier on the EM Bypass end of Ultadanga flyover. Officials said heavy vehicle drivers often flout rules and use the flyovers of the city. Last year, the height bar on the Ultadanga-bound flank of Kestopur flyover was crushed by heavy vehicles twice. This year in March, the height barrier installed ahead of the Kestopur flyover was hit thrice in just 24 hours.
 
 In New Town, the road dividers have green bamboo fences. The railings not only help protect the trees on the median, but also prevent pedestrians from crossing the streets haphazardly. Traffic cops requested Hidco to install permanent steel fences as the bamboo railings can easily be damaged, specially in places where pedestrians have a tendency to cross roads illegally.
