LUCKNOW: The sudden rain on Tuesday night has not only added to the chill but also exposed the collective failure of   and its private partner,  , in disposing of the waste. As a result, trash lies on roadsides, rotting. 

 Despite working for nearly a year, Eco-Green has been unable to deliver on the expectations.   is still not being collected regularly from houses, it is mostly being dumped on roadsides or vacant plots, clogging the drains. 
 
 Eco-Green's other task was to gradually convert garbage dumping grounds into cleaner areas by lifting trash from the source and transporting it to the treatment plant the same day. However, garbage is being picked from only about half the houses. That from the rest of the houses is still being dumped on roads, drains like   and Kukrail nullah, vacant plots and public places.
 
 It is only on occasions like on Wednesday (UP Diwas) when littered sites like Munshipulia Crossing, Rahimnagar, Station Road, Narhi market, Nehru Enclave, Indiranagar mandi and Gole market tempo stand were cleaned. However, LMC ignored the other streets where TOI reporters captured pictures of garbage-littered roads and cattle feeding on it. These areas include Wazir Hasan Road, the road in front of Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, Christian College and Golaganj Road. 
 
 Lucknow's waste management has been a never-ending woe. Eco-Green replaced Jyoti Envirotech in March 2017 after it repeatedly failed to operate the waste treatment plant to its capacity. A year on, the new company is moving at a snail's pace. It has failed to complete both the targets despite three deadlines- August, September and December 2017. Few of the commercial and residential areas are only partially covered under door-to-door garbage collection. 
 
 While there are about 400-odd garbage dumping sites across the city, LMC & Eco-Green have been able to convert only 30 of them into cleaner spots.
