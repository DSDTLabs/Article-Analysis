RANCHI: Thirty-nine children, hailing from various districts in Jharkhand, were rescued by a team of child rights workers and anti-human trafficking activists at   in Kolkata on Friday.

 The minors, who were unable to provide their addresses, were reportedly stuck in the city for the last three years and were forced to do menial jobs for small amounts of money. Child rights activist Baidyanath Kumar said, "The children were lured away from their homes on the pretext of getting a decent salary for the jobs. Most of these children were forced to do menial jobs at various homes and offices in Gariahat in Kolkata. Some of the kids managed to escape their employers and were found by the police who sent them to children's homes across Bengal. We co-ordinated with the CWC to ensure these children returned home safely."
 
 Kumar added, "Since most of these children cannot speak Bengali, they found it really difficult to communicate with the authorities. When a few of them managed to describe their homes in Jharkhand, CWC initiated the process to help them return safely. We are trying to track their employers with whom they stayed in the last two-three years."
 
 Thirty-one children were taken to Khunti on Friday by CWC members. Khunti CWC chairperson Manoj Kumar Rai said, "The children will be kept for a couple of days at  , a non-profit organisation which works for the upliftment of under-priviledged women and children. After counselling the children, we will try to help them return safely to their homes."
 
 Five girls have been kept at Prem Ashray, children's home, in Ranchi.
 
 The child rights workers who were part of the operation said most of the minors who were rescued belonged to Ranchi, Khunti, Hazaribag, West Singbhum and Dhanbad districts. "Some of these minors also hailed from Bihar. We have asked the CWC members from West Bengal to co-ordinate with Bihar authorities to help these children return home," Rai said.
