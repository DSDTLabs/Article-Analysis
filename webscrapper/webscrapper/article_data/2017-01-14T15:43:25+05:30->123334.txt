NEW DELHI: India's new limited-overs skipper   heaped praise on his predecessor  , saying that he will never shy away from taking advice from the former skipper whenever he finds himself in a quandary during the course of the game.

 During the press conference ahead of the first ODI against England on Sunday in Pune, Kohli said Dhoni is the most intelligent cricketer around and will specially consult him when it comes to using the Decision Review System (DRS).
 
 "It's priceless. I saw a stat yesterday that 95% of the appeals that he's made in his career have been successful. As a captain I have no sort of extra thinking as far as DRS is concerned. He's one voice, if he tells me it's outside the line or it is missing, the decision stands there. It's not left up to doubt or any further debate from there on," Kohli said.
 
 Dhoni will be playing under Kohli for the first time as a pure wicket-keeper batsman and Kohli reckons it will ease the pressure off the former skipper. "I think he will bat with a lot more freedom and assurance. He won't think twice about attempting a big shot," Kohli said.
 
 India are ranked third in the ICC ODI Championship, and after this series do not play any more ODIs before the Champions Trophy in June, where Kohli will hope to defend the title. He echoed coach  's view that India will not be experimenting with considering the Champions Trophy is a few months away.
 
 After reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup, India haven't had the best of outings in the 50-over format, losing ODI series to Bangladesh (away), South Africa (home) and (Australia). The only convincible series win came against New Zealand (3-2) in November last year.
 
 On  's selection, Kohli said he is someone who brought into the team on the basis of a strong first-class season and his inclusion will also help him and Dhoni feed off each other's energy well.
