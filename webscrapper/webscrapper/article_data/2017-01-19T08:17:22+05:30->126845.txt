HYDERABAD: There seems to be no respite in sight for the parents of seven-year-old Sai Prabalika, who was allegedly administered toxic Intravenous (IV) solution at   last month.
While it has been 42 days since she was admitted, there has been no visible improvement in Prabalika's condition. Now, her three-year-old younger sibling too has taken ill, adding to the miseries of the parents Dharawath Bikshapathy and Sumalatha.
 
 With one child in the hospital and the other ailing at their rented home in Uppal, the duo on Wednesday confessed it was getting increasingly difficult for them to carry on. Worse, the hospital authorities expressed helplessness in giving a clear picture as to when  , who is suffering from a rare neurodegenerative disorder, will recover.
 
 “My younger girl Shanvi had   yesterday (Tuesday) but neither of us could visit her as we had to stay at the Gandhi Hospital to look after Prabalika. She is still bedridden and on artificial oxygen,“ said Bikshapathy , adding that his brother is now taking care of his other daughter.
 
 In fact, prolonged hospital stay due to delay in recovery of their daughter's health has already cost Bikshapathy his driving job. “We want the ho spital authorities to discharge her as soon as she recovers,“ said Bikshapathy , sharing how one of the doctors treating her hinted at the possibility of referring her to another hospital for better treatment.
 
 However, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, Dr   , said they have not taken any decision so far. “She is suffering from a rare chronic disease and it is incurable. However, we are not compromising on the quality of her treatment,“ he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the Telangana drug control authorities have not yet disclosed if the foreign material found in saline bottle on December 15 was linked to deterioration of Prabalika's condition.
