PUNE: The civic administration on Friday swung into action and started clearing the administrative processes to hire contractual staff for surveillance and float tenders to procure insecticides, larvicides’ spraying pumps, fogging machines.

 
 The move follows the TOI report highlighting the callous approach of the civic health department in procuring the required equipment, which could send dengue and chikungunya cases soaring in the monsoon.
 
 “All the administrative processes are being cleared to float the tender to hire contractual staff for door-to-door surveillance. On Friday, we sent the file for administrative approval. Simultaneously, tendering processes are in the pipeline for purchases of insecticides, spraying pumps and fogging machines,”  , assistant medical officer of health,  , said.
 
 Usually, tenders are floated during mid-April and requisite resources are procured by May-end that helps replenish the supplies for the season ahead. “We have decided to purchase insecticides from government-designated online portal. We will float the online tender through this portal to expedite the purchase. The remaining will be procured through routine tender processes,”  , head of the insect control department at PMC, said.
 
 The civic health officials have also started shortlisting models of thermal fogging machines and spraying pumps. “We have already readied the old pumps and machines by changing their non-functioning spare parts,” Baliwant said.
