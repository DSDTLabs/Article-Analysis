MUMBAI: Through all of Thursday, social media witnessed a bitter exchange between film director   and politicians and activists over the film-maker’s Women’s Day tweet.

 Varma had on March 7 drawn the ire of women’s groups by tweeting: Wish all women give men as much happiness as  .
 
 BJP MLA   on Thursday threatened to halt the filming of Varma’s movies if he did not render an unconditional apology. Kadam said, “I am president of the Film Studio Setting and Allied Mazdoor Union, which has 52,000 members. They range from lightmen, carpenters, technicians, set designers and make-up artists to sundry professionals. They will not allow Ram Gopal Varma’s films to proceed. Each time Varma has a picture coming up for release, he makes a controversial statement to gain publicity.”
 
 Kadam urged actor Amitabh Bachchan to not shoot his picture with the film-maker till the issue is settled.
