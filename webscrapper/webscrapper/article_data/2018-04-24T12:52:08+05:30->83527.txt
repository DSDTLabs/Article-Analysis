HYDERABAD: A Telangana   delegation on Monday urged governor   to direct the state government to help farmers who lost their crops due to the recent unseasonal rains, and implement Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. 

 The BJP team, which included former   minister   and BJP floor leader in the   G  , said the recent thunder showers accompanied by hailstones had caused huge loss to farmers in several districts, including Nalgonda, Khammam, Vikarabad, Kamareddy, Medchal, Suryapet, Siddipet, Karimnagar, Warangal, Peddapalli and Mahabubnagar.
 
 Due to these rains, major damage had occurred to paddy. They claimed that agriculture department officials were yet to visit agricultrue fields to assess crop loss. "Any loss of time in taking up this exercise, will not help in assessing the actual damage," they said in the representation.
 
 They appealed to the government to pay 35,000 per acre for loss of mango, 25,000 per acre for paddy, 20,000 per acre for maize and vegetables.
