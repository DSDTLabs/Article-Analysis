ERODE: In a gruesome incident, a man with learning difficulties was   by the kin of a woman whom he beat to death near Perundurai here on Thursday.

 The deceased were identified as K Marayammal, 78, of   village near Kanchikoil in Perundurai taluk and her relative M  , 60.
 
 Marayammal, police said, was living with her son Thangavel, 55, who runs a weaving unit in his house. It was Marayammal who insisted on getting her relative Arumugam admitted to a private hospital in Coimbatore as he had learning difficulties.
 
 When Arumugam returned home after a month-long treatment, he used to quarrel with Marayammal for sending him to hospital.
 
 On Thursday afternoon, Arumugam picked up a fight with Marayammal and beat her up using an iron rod. “Marayammal received a severe head injury and collapsed on the ground,” the police said. Thangavel and his relatives rushed Marayammal to a private hospital in Erode, where she died without responding to the treatment.
 
 Meanwhile, a few unidentified persons tied Arumugam to a coconut tree and thrashed him severely. 
 
 When he succumbed to his injuries on the spot, the gang disposed of the body in a roadside pit.
 
 When alerted, the Kanchikoil police rushed to the spot and sent the body for postmortem. Preliminary investigation revealed that Arumugam was   by the relatives of Marayammal to avenge her death. “We have registered a case and launched the search for the culprits,” the police said.
 
 Arumugam is survived by wife  , 52, son Govindasamy, 35 and daughter Suguna, 32.
