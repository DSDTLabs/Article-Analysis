CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister   on Tuesday told the   that the state government was forced to introduce new development tax of Rs 200 per month on the income tax payers because of the pressure from international agencies and banks. He clarified that the tax payers would get deduction in their income tax for that amount.

 “If we want loans or funding from the World Bank, it wants that we also put some tax. This was the reason for imposing the development tax. But this is fully deductible from your income tax. We are not putting in on the non-tax payers,” said the chief minister.
 
 
  
 
 In his budget speech on March 24, Punjab finance minister   had said, “The government has decided to bring in a legislation for imposing a nominal development tax of Rs 200 per month on the income tax payees who are engaged in professions, trades, callings and employments.” Similar tax is also being collected by various other states including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for development for a long time.

They had put the condition that something has to be done. We thought that we can put Rs 200 tax on the tax payers. It was necessary for Punjab,” said Amarinder.
