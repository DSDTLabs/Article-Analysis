Singer  's show at a private   in Kanpur on Tuesday led to a lot of ruckus with the ' ' singer slamming the college authorities for not having proper security arrangements, especially for the girls present at the  .
 The event started off smoothly but as soon as Randhawa stepped on the stage, all hell broke lose. Students broke the security barricade and rushed to be in front of the stage. In the meanwhile, Randhawa started his performance by singing his hit songs like ' ', ' ', etc, that further made the crowd go berserk with the bouncers and college security guards unable to control them.

 Seeing the uncontrolable young crowd, Randhawa stopped his performance midway and requested the students to step away from the stage. "Aap log please thoda peechhe ho jaiye. Please girls ko dhakka mat dijiye," he requested.

 However, the enthusiastic crowd didn't pay heed to Guru's appeal which made him stop his performance again. "Aise toh performance nahi ho sakta. College administration ko crowd ke liye proper arrangement karna chahiye tha. Main toh Kanpur 11-12 baje subah hi aa gaya tha, mujhe pehle hi performance ke liye bula lena chahiye tha. Venue bhi city ke outskirts main hai, yahan se girls kaise wapas jayengi?‚Äù he questioned the college authorities.
 Then, calling out to the security on stage, Guru made them help the girls in the front row to be pulled onto the stage. "Arre inn ladkiyon aur baccho ko stage par lao aur safely peechhe pahunchao. Baccho ko toh concert mein lana hi nahi chahiye tha aap logo ko," he said. It was only after he brought the situation under control did Guru resume his performance and went on to sing songs like 'Lahore' and 'Kaun Nachdi.'
