PANAJI: Around 50.6% of all schools in Goa are without a playground facility in its campus, according to the data for 2015-16, released by Union human resource development (HRD) ministry’s DISE wing. This figure is a 3% improvement over what was reported for the academic year 2014-15.
 
  States who faired worse than Goa include  ,  , Bihar, Orissa, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Jammu & Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
  
  In the case of Goa, schools, which have different sections such as primary, high school and higher secondary school combined, were more likely to have a playground within its premises, than schools only offering primary, high school or higher secondary education, exclusively, the report states.
  
  A study by NGO Bharatiya Jain Sangathana (BJS), that has signed MoUs with Goa government, submitted in the last decade, had already pointed out this lack of playground facility in the state. “A bulk of the school buildings were constructed immediately after Liberation and at a number of places, they do not even have compound gates. In some cases, land registration documents are not available. Disputes, encroachments, obstructions and objections to so-called school land are common. This has delayed the developmental work in some schools,” it stated.
  
  Recently, the state government set up the Cujira school complex, where six schools located in   were relocated to Bambolim. This has enabled these institutes to provide auxillary facilities to students. Besides plans to shift more schools to Cujira, there are plans to set up similar complexes in the outskirts of towns such as Margao, Mapusa and Vasco.
  
  DISE data shows that primary schools in Goa are worse off than high schools and higher secondary schools.
