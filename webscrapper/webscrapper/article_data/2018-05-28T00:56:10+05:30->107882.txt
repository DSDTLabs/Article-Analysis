GURUGRAM: As part of augmenting power supply across the city, discom has installed three more transformers in key residential areas. Officials said they had already installed 300 transformers in 2018. This comes just days after complaints mounted about repeated outages. 

 Power demand in the city has soared to 270 lakh units per day. Officials are expecting the demand to exceed 300 lakh units this year. On Sunday, many residents complained about the frequent shutdowns and fluctuations in several areas.
 
 Officials told TOI they have added three high capacity transformers of 100/200 kVA in the city to augment the demand. “We install transformers based on the capacity and demand of that area. All our transformers have DT (Distribution Transformer) meters attached to them. These DT meters keep track of the consumption per transformer. It also notes down the number of consumers drawing power from it. Thus, we get to know how much more power is being drawn by a particular area and accordingly we issue new transformers,” said  , superintendent engineer, New Gurugram.
 
 Officials said this way they don’t end up installing transformers at a place where it is not required. “This winter we added 300 more transformers into the city because we were expecting demand to exceed 300 lakh units per day. We have added 20,000 more consumers,” they said.
 
 Despite all these apparent preparations, the city still continues to suffer from bleak power situation. On Sundays too, TOI received reports of outages from areas like Sushant Lok 1 and Sector 14. Residents complained about the frequent tripping of the power supply and power fluctuations that damaged their home appliances. “The power situation has suddenly become so bad,” said  , a member of RWA Sector 14. “There are many areas in our sector where residents apprised me about their electronic appliances fusing out.”
