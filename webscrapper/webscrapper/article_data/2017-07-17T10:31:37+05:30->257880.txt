NAGPUR: The penultimate day of the Bhagini Mandal Nagpur District   tournament turned out to be the busiest and topsy-turvy day for the seeds with several fancied players tumbling out at the Dhanwate National College Indoor Hall here on Sunday.

 Top seed in the U-10 boys singles Rutva Sajwan was knocked out by unseeded Pranay Gadewar. Winner of the last two tournaments, Rutva was surprised by newcomer Pranay in the quarterfinal.
 
 However, Pranay's giant-killing run was stopped by second seed Jai Rajesh in the final. It was like third time lucky for Jai. The tall shuttler had lost two close finals against Rutva in the last one month. The Standard III student of Modern School, Civil Lines, Jai was stretched to his limits in the summit clash.
 
 "I am happy to win in my third attempt in the final. Pranay looks a promising player. It was a very tough match," said Jai, who spent almost entire day on the premises of DNC with his parents.
 
  lived up to her top billing and captured yet another U-10 girls singles crown. In a repeat of last tourney's final, Nishika downed second seed   21-18, 21-12.
 
 Unseeded   caused a major upset by toppling top seed Siddhant Bawankar to storm into the U-15 boys singles final. In a match, which went to the wire, Sarthak registered a sensational come-from-behind win in three games.
 
 Sarthak will face second seed Nilay Deshpande, who prevailed over third seed Sudhansh Cinthray in the second semis.
 
 The U-15 girls singles final will be played between Aditi Sadhankar and second seed  . While Aditi halted the impressive run of fourth seed  , in-form Devika got the better of   in the semis.
