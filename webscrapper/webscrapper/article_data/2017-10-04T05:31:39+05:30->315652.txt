BIJNOR: A 36-year-old woman who had filed a complaint in court against a local   for attempting to   her was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday. The woman, who had been living alone with her five kids after her husband moved to Delhi last year for work, had told police she was being harassed.

 After seeing police’s alleged reluctance to take action in the matter, she had approached the chief judicial magistrate’s court. The first hearing was set for next week.
 
 The woman, a Dalit, had gone missing on Monday. On Tuesday morning, her body was found 250 metres away from her village in a sugarcane field. There were strangulation marks on her neck.
 
 According to former village head Guru Sevak, she had written to several district officials after police failed to register her complaint against Badarpur (rural)   chief Vijay Singh.
 
 When contacted, Singh said, “Guru Sevek wanted to grab a piece of land belonging to a poor man. When I opposed him, he used the woman to trap me in a fake case. She used to live with him. I have nothing to do with this case.”
 
 Badarpur station house officer Raj Kumar Sharma said, “We are questioning both Guru Sevak and Vijay Singh.” On Tuesday evening, police also filed a case against Sevak over a complaint that just before the woman’s death, Sevek had telephoned her.”
