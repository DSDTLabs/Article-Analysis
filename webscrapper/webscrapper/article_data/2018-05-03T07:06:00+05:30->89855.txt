Ludhiana:   across Ludhiana city and its surrounding districts brought life to a standstill for some time on Wednesday afternoon. The Met department has predicted that the dust storm may return in next 24 hours. The sudden change in weather brought respite to the residents from the hot and sultry weather conditions that prevailed over the last few days. 

 Director at the Chandigarh Met department Surender Paul told TOI that speed of the dust storm was as high as 70 to 80 kms per hour. He added western disturbance and easterly winds were the factors behind Wednesday’s storm.
 
 Along with chances of dust storm returning on Thursday, the department also predicted that Thursday and Friday will experience light to moderate rainfall of 1-2cm.
 
 Meanwhile, residents were taken aback by the sudden storm. Though, thunder storm and rain were in prediction, people did not really expect the intensity to be this high. A number of drivers were caught in the storm and had to wait till it ceased.
 
 “I had gone to pick my children up from school in Sarabha Nagar when the dust storm lashed the city. I had to keep myself locked in the car till the storm subsided. It was a horrifying experience to witness such high-speed storm,” said Harpreet Kaur, a homemaker of Pakhowal Road.
 
 A number of people said they have not experienced such a storm in recent times.
 
 “It was pitch dark and the wind blowing was so strong that we had a feeling it would uproot not only trees, but buildings too. I haven’t seen such a storm in last many years. Thankfully, till now we have not heard about any loss to life,” said Ashok Kumar, a trader of Civil Lines.
 
 Meanwhile reports from the neighbouring Khanna, Jagraon, Doraha, Raikot, Samrala and Machiwara suggested that the dust storm was equally intense in these areas. On Khanna Samrala road, dust storm even uprooted a few trees.
