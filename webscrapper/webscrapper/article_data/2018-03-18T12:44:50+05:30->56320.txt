Rajarshi Dey’s directorial debut ‘Birpurush’ is yet to hit the theatres and he has already started shooting for his second venture titled ‘Shubho Noboborsho’. Just like ‘Birpurush’, this one will also cast female characters as protagonists. The film revolves around a road trip of four middle-aged ladies on a reunion.

 This is touted to be the first road trip movie in Tollywood and that too starring all girls as main characters is a first of its kind in Bengali cinema. Although Mainak Bhaumik’s ‘Ami Aar Amar Girlfriends’ had a small part of a girls' trip, no one else has tried their hands on this subject so far.
 
 The story follows four friends, who meet after a long gap, having become frustrated with their life. Their teacher present in the reunion suggests them to go for a trip and during their trip to Thailand, they finally discover the long-lost happiness. They admit the unhappiness in their life and also meet new men in their life.
 
 Rajarshi has chosen an interesting cast for his second film. The four leading ladies will be   as an actress,   as a classical dancer,   taking the role of a teacher and finally   playing a housewife turned chef.
 
 ‘Shubho Noboborsho’ is expected to hit the screens this summer while the release date for ‘Birpurush’ has been pushed back.
