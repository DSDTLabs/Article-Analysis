Oscar-winning composer AR   shared his moment of “catching up” with celebrated composer   at the Oscar Concert in Los Angeles recently. Zimmer, the man behind the music of The Dark Knight trilogy, Gladiator, Inception and The Lion King, seemed engrossed in conversation with Rahman — as seen in a photo shared by the latter on Instagram. “Catching up,” Rahman captioned the image.

 The Indian composer, lovingly called the   of Madras, was suited and booted for the concert, where his hit score from Slumdog Millionaire was included in the line-up.
 
 “Getting ready for the Oscar concert with the LA philharmonic orchestra,” Rahman tweeted before the concert. He posed besides the golden Oscar statue.
 
 AR Rahman had brought home two Oscars for the Jai ho composition for British filmmaker Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire at the 81st Academy Awards. 
 
 The concert, in the run-up to the 90th annual Oscars, was held at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, as part of a collaboration between the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Los Angeles Philharmonic.
 It included the world premiere of suites arranged from all five original score Oscar nominees: Dunkirk by Zimmer, Phantom Thread by Jonny Greenwood, The Shape of Water by Alexandre Desplat, Star Wars: The Last Jedi by John Williams and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri by Carter Burwell.
