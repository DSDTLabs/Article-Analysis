COIMBATORE: Members of   (TPDK), along with other political and student outfits, on Wednesday staged a protest against the   (CBSE) for allegedly including divisive ideas such as varna system (caste system) in the syllabus.

 A school had included an objective question in the Social Science paper asking Class VI CBSE students to pick the lowest caste among the divisions in varna system, the protesters said. 
 
 The options read brahmana, shudra, kshatriya and vanaprastha. A snapshot of the question paper has been posted in social media platforms, crating a furore.
 
 Such questions would sow casteist ideas in students’ minds and inevitably create divisions among them, said K   of TPDK. “Class VI students would be around 12 years old. If they are asked in an exam to pick the lowest caste among the divisions, they would sub-consciously imbibe the regressive idea of high and low caste. This might also lead to students viewing their classmates based on caste, thus creating divisions right in the classroom level,” he said.
 
 Ramakrishnan said the Union government should direct CBSE to remove such ideas from textbooks. Members of Viduthalai Siruthaigal, SDPI and other outfits also participated in the protest.
