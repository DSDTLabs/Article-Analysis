Nagpur: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has revealed in an RTI reply that Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCB) led the charts in outstanding gross Non-Performing Assets (NPA) at a whopping Rs8.99 lakh crore till December 31, 2017. In comparison, urban cooperative banks had NPAs of Rs21,297 crore on the same date.

 NPAs have become a major cause of concern to the central government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, the RBI surprisingly doesn’t have information regarding NPAs of district central cooperative banks (DCCBs). RBI central information officer SK Panigrahi informed RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar that they had forwarded his query about DCCBs to NABARD for sharing of information, if available with them.
 
 Kolarkar had asked for records of complaints received by RBI against various banks, and number of persons removed from banks for facing corruption charges from January 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018. He had also sought number of complaints of fraud in banks received by RBI, and the collective amount involved in it in the same period. He further asked names of banks that failed to follow KYC norms and penalty imposed on them.
 
 Panigrahi’s reply stated that over 1.73 lakh complaints were received by them, with the highest complaints at behemoth State Bank of India (SBI) with a whopping 46,240 lodged in about 14 months. This was followed by private majors HDFC, ICICI and Axis banks. This is a jump of over 61,000 in comparison to complaints lodged from January 1 to December 31, 2016.
 
 These complaints are received by 20 offices of banking ombudsman, the RBI officer said, but they did not have information on number of employees terminated for banking frauds.
 
 Though the apex bank could not given all the information demanded, it informed that four state cooperative banks and 34 DCCBs had violated KYC norms, but no penalty was imposed on them.
