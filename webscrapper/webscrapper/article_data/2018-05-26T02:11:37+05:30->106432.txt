NAVI MUMBAI:   (PCMC) has approached the state urban development department for special permission to impose and collect property tax from the residents in   nodes, which now comes under  . 

 The permission will be obtained to strengthen the finances of the civic body. Once given, Cidco nodes and MIDC areas will come under the tax net soon. PCMC commissioner   said, "PCMC wants the state government to vest PCMC with the authority to collect property tax and we have requested the urban development for the same. An assurance has been given to us in this regard."
 
 Deshmukh added, "The state has to provide an agency to do the PCMC property tax assessment and have to pay around Rs 6 crore. By giving permission to PCMC, it will do the same work and save money. PCMC has not been able to assess and collect property tax for two years owing to various issues such as manpower crunch. PCMC will be able to monitor it. This will bring tax into its kitty faster and reduce time and tax losses during this period." 
 
 "We estimated that there are around 3 lakh properties in PCMC area. All residential, commercial and industrial properties will come under property tax net. We estimate that a sum between Rs 350 crore and Rs 400 crore could be garnered as property tax."
 
 Currently, Cidco collects service tax in its area and the tehsildar office has been demanding non agriculture tax.
