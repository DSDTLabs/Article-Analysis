Pailan (South 24 Parganas): Chief minister   Banerjee said on Monday the unemployment rate in West Bengal had fallen by 40%.

 She added that unemployment rates in the rural sector could fall further with a little boost to activities such as pisciculture, food processing and poultry farming.
 
 State food processing secretary Nandini Chakrabarty informed the CM that South 24 Parganas was the country’s largest vegetable producer with a total output of 11.71 lakh metric tonnes. 
 
 The district was also ahead in raw processing of fruits and flowers, she said, adding that Mother Dairy and Sufal Bangla were engaged in raw processing of guavas for domestic and foreign markets.
 
 The CM also urged officials to augment egg production in the district that is currently able to meet only half the 101-crore demand for eggs.
 
 Keeping an eye on rapid urbanisation in South 24 Parganas — Sonarpur, Narendrapur and Baruipur — the CM took stock of the upcoming Baruipur township and shifting of Alipore jail to Baruipur. She also asked Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee to talk to the authorities of Gurusaday Museum along Diamond Harbour Road to see if they could give some land to shift the Alipore district headquarters.
 
 “I have come to know that the Centre has stopped funding the museum. Sovan, please initiate a dialogue with the museum authorities and see if they can give some land to the government. We will buy the land and provide funds for running the museum,” Banerjee said.
 
 The CM also directed the public works department to take over maintenance of Garia Station Road, parts of which are now maintained by PWD, the municipality and the zilla parishad. 
 
 While rolling out her plans at the district administrative meeting, Banerjee announced the government’s decision to turn the Sunderbans into a district.
