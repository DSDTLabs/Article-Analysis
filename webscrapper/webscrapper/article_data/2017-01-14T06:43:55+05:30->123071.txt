HYDERABAD: From preparing the traditional `bhogi' in the morning to indulging in kite flying battles, residents across the twin cities rung in the three-day harvest festivals   and Pongal with much fervour on Thursday. Family get-togethers and lunches were held in various parts of the city even as skies were dotted with colourful kites.

 “While we began the day preparing Pongal, which we later distributed among neighbours as well, the rest of the day was spent in making a `bhomma kolu' akin to the arrangement of dolls and figurines seen at homes during Deepavali. Although we could not prepare pongal on wood fire, like it is done in villages, we managed to follow the tradition using a gas stove,“ said one Uma Maheshwari, a resident of Chandanagar.
 
 Praveen Rao, a resident of   , was looking forward to participate in a `kite battle' with friends and family on Saturday . “I paid a visit to Charminar nearly a week ago and bought kites, thread and other supplies for the battle being organised at Himayat Nagar. Kites are a regular sight in West Marredpally now. My children have become really interested in flying kites too,“ said Rao.
 
 Sankranti celebrations were held at various places in the city including Shilparamam and   , which is playing host to a week-long kite festival. Res taurants also spruced up their menus to offer sankranti lunches and festive delicacies to patrons.
 
 While many decided to stay in the city and celebrate the festival with their families, several others extended their weekend to travel to nearby tourist destinations such as Hampi, Goa and Ban galore. “While I spend Sankranti with my family every year, this time I decided to head to Hampi with friends. I a hope to visit a few villages on the way to Hampi so as to understand how the festival is celebrated in rural Telangana and AP,“ said Namrata Goud, a techie and resident of Madhapur.
