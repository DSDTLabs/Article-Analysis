CHARMINAR: There seems to be no respite in sight for   residents who have been battling unhygienic conditions. Within a week of one manhole breaking, now another one has given way leaving the entire area flooded with dirty water. Residents of Natraj Nagar rued how the defunct drainage system has made their lives miserable.

 “Frequently , sewage water flows into our lanes causing serious inconvenience.The stink forces people to stay indoors and put up with extremely unhygienic conditions,“ said Khaja, a resident of Allahbanda in Natraj Nagar.
 
 While authorities concerned had previously inspected the choked and overflowing drainage lines in the area, residents complained that they have failed to offer any permanent solution.
 
 “Several residents of the area are suffering from severe health problems like diabetes. The filthiness has only compounded their problems.Despite repeated complaints, workers turn up at the site but return without doing anything about the menace,“ another resident,   said.
 
 Predictably, residents have now urged the authorities to take immediate measures to improve the condition of residents, before the situation worsens. They rued how work on the drainage lines has been pending for the last several months. “The authorities should swing into action as the health of children and the elderly are adversely affected. If not addressed soon, this can turn into a major concern,“ said another aggrieved resident of Sarwar Nagar.
