Nagpur: After a complaint by animal activists regarding negligence in sterilization of dogs, some residents have also come forward to report ‘mysterious deaths’ of strays of their locality. Two days back, TOI reported about activist Reena Singh lodging a complaint at Gittikhadan police station, stating that stray dogs were found dead at the Animal Birth Control (ABC) centre. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) recently kick-started ABC operations of strays at the centre set up at the animal shelter run by NGO Nagpur SPCA at Friends Colony. On Wednesday, residents of Tilak Nagar wrote to the police complaining about ‘inhuman killing’ of dogs in the area. “I was giving food to about a dozen stray dogs in my area. Recently, some people came and told us that they are from NMC, and are taking the dogs away for treatment. After four days, all the dogs were dead,” wrote a resident Sunil Chokdane, urging police to treat this complaint as a first information report (FIR). Another resident, Sneha Meshram, alleged in her complaint that around 10 dogs of her area died after the operations. “Post operation, the strays would be kept in cages with their urine and excreta. They have died because of such unhygienic conditions,” she said. NMC and police officials are waiting for the post mortem reports, after which they will take action against the NGO.
