 The suit, filed by   and four others on January 31, seeks a temporary injunction against the PCB’s public notice, warning of eviction and other action following a civic fire audit report on the Fashion Street market. The name of the M G Road Hawkers’ Association is not mentioned in the cause title of the suit.
