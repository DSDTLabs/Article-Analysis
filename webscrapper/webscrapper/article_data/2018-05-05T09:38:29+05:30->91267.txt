 A case has been registered against unidentified persons. According to the complainant, Nirmal, his vehicles, a scooter and a motorcycle were parked outside his house and were torched after midnight. He said neighbours saw the vehicles burning and informed them. 
 
 The residents, along with Nirmal, tried to douse the fire and called fire tenders but the two vehicles were completely burnt by the time fire tenders reached. 
 
 While police believe the act was motivated by someone who nursed a grudge against Nirmal, he says he didn’t have enmity with anyone. “There were many two- wheelers parked in the lane but miscreants torched only our vehicles. We had no enmity with anyone but someone destroyed our vehicles,” Nirmal rued.
