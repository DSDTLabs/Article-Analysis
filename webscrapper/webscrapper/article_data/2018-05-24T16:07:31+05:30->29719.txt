 In his complaint, Vinayak had alleged just after 15 days of his daughter’s marriage with Janesh in 2010, he and his parents started harassing her for dowry.

 My daughter left the house of her in-laws in 2011 and started living in Mohali,” he alleged. He said Janesh fled to the US and his daughter went there to live with him on the assurance of Shashi, but   her in the US too. It was stated that his daughter had filed a domestic violence case against Janesh in the US. After a month, Vinayak brought her back to India.
