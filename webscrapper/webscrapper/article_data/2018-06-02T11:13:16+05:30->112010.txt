HYDERABAD: Despite an assurance from industries minister  , the state government is yet to constitute the Telangana  . 

 Industries associations, including pharma bodies, say despite repeated requests and KTR himself ordering officials to form the appellate authority, no action has been taken so far. 
 
 Industries that are aggrieved by decisions of   usually approach the appellate authority for relief. But now with no authority and the National Green Tribunal, Chennai bench having vacancies - lowering the chances of getting an early hearing - industries have to approach either the NGT at Delhi or the Hyderabad HC.
 
 According to the minutes of the review meeting on March 3, 2018 by KTR, the PCB appellate authority came up for discussion. Officials informed KTR that the decision on the committee rests with the state government. KTR then directed officials to constitute the appellate authority.
 
 A top functionary of a Hyderabad industries body told TOI, "After the Justice V Ramulu-led appellate authority period lapsed, the new committee has not been constituted for almost a year. Industries are not able to file their petitions for redressal of grievances particularly in relation to penalties imposed by the Telangana PCB. The industries are further put to additional hardship as there is no operating judicial bench at the NGT Southern Bench at Chennai. It would be a long drawn procedure to approach High Court in such cases. Asked about the delay in the setting up of the appellate authority, we were informed that the file is pending with the Chief Minister's Office." 
 
 PCB member secretary P Satyanarayana Reddy told TOI, "The PCB has no role in the constitution of the appellate authority. The issue is with the government. Usually, industries can approach the authority for the first appeal and then NGT. They can, however, file writ appeals in the HC. The PCB too has an option to file an appeal in the NGT against the orders of the appellate authority."
