NEW DELHI: There is no respite for commuters even after peak hours on Delhi roads. The ubiquitous yellow barricades not only slow down traffic, but sometimes also cause standstills that take some time to clear. The   has now advised local SHOs to put up night barricading only after consulting the area   inspectors about the traffic volume at the time.

 
  
  
 
 “It takes me about an hour to reach Chirag Dilli from Connaught Place around 11pm. I recognise the concerns about security, but the barricades should be set up with the traffic volume in mind,” protested  , a publishing company employee.
 
 In south Delhi, the barricades were doubled after a rise in snatching and robbery along  , though typically there are around three pickets over 10km after 11pm. These do impede flow of traffic. Motor snarls sometimes stretch up to Jangpura whenever a   is put up near Lajpat Nagar. South Extension and the Rao Tula Ram crossing, infamous for traffic jams during the day, are as bad past midnight.
 
 “We plan to increase the intervals at which the barricades are erected to allow effective dispersal of traffic,” said a police officer.
