NEW DELHI: The   (FIPB) will be done away with. Further liberalisation of the FDI regime is on the cards. Set up as part of the 1991 reforms, the board has outlived its utility. 

  Multiple options are now being considered to deal with FDI proposals.   Arun Jaitley suggested that in sectors where a nod from the administrative ministry is needed, the government would ensure there's no duplication of work. 
 
 Economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das, who heads FIPB, indicated that a system similar to a non-bank finance company could be created.
 
 The FIPB, originally headed by the PM's principal secretary, was to be a common platform for ministries to clear proposals, and in several cases decide the rules. As the government began allowing more and more FDI through the automatic route, the FIPB became less relevant.
 
 Now, over 90% of FDI don't need to come to FIPB, whose mandate is to recommend investments of up to Rs 5,000 crore to the finance minister. FDI beyond the cap needs cabinet committee on economic affairs approval.
