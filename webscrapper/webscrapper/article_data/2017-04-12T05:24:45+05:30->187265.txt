Pakistan’s former president   said he feared a sharp rise in tension between India and Pakistan following   being sentenced to death by a military court. 

 “India will create a hue and cry about Jadhav’s case internationally,” he told a TV channel on Tuesday. 
 
 In the West, he said, death penalty is not considered a favourable form of punishment and India will use it for Jadhav’s defence at global forums. “There will be a sharp rise in tension.
 
  Pakistan has to stand fast against India’s accusations of the move being of premeditated murder,”he said.
