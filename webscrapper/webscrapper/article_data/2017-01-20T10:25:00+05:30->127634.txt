BELAGAVI: In an embarrassment to the Congress party in Karnataka, the income-tax department raided the residences of small-scale industries minister   and state Congress women's wing president   in Belagavi and Gokak towns on Thursday. 

  I-T officials from Goa, Bengaluru and Hubballi conducted the raids on Jarkiholi, his younger brother Lakhan L Jarkiholi, the minister's trusted aides   and Ali Atthar's houses in Belagavi and Gokak. In Hebbalkar's case, her house in upscale Kuvempunagar in Belagavi, two sisters' residences in   and the Harsha sugar factory owned by her were also raided. 
 
  A source said that IT sleuths found a receipt pertaining to the purchase of solar panels in Hebbalkar's elder sister's house and documents on purchase of land in the younger sibling's residence. 
 Both were summoned for an inquiry at Hebbalkar's residence. Hebbalkar was not in Belagavi and had come to Bengaluru to attend a Congress rally against demonetization.
 
 Sources said that as many as 13 IT sleuths from Bengaluru, Hubballi and Goa Circle led the team while preparing for the raids.
 
 They arrived in Hubballi on Wednesday and hired vehicles to conduct the raids without disclosing the destination to the drivers and the police force deputed by the Hubballi police commissionerate.
