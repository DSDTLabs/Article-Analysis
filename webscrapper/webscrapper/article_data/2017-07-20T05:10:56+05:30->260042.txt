Kolkata: A number of factors combined to choke   on Wednesday during peak office hours. The fact that there were five different rallies also meant that the agony continued till late into the evening. 

 While cops blamed the rain as one of the factors, broken down vehicles, road repair and out-of-work signals added to the pain. As a result, the 45-minute journey from   to Moulali took double the time. And crossing Maa flyover took more than half-an-hour.
 
 According to traffic police sources, the rain on Wednesday was sporadic. “Once the rain held up, we found a huge number of people and vehicles on the road. It was one of the main factors why Howrah bridge witnessed jams in the morning,” said an officer. By the time the mess was sorted, the schools gave over and this added to the pressure on the road. Motorists tried to avoid the roads that are usually waterlogged, which meant a select few roads had to bear the brunt.
 
 Localized factors added to the commuters’ problems. Bad roads forced vehicles to crawl on DH Road and EM Bypass. At Alipore Judges Court Road, repair work affected vehicles crossing Taratala. Huge snarls engulfed the entire stretch right up to PTS, said officers. 
 
 Two vehicles broke down on Vidyasagar Setu and   flyover. “A vehicle broke down near   on the eastern flank of AJC Bose Road flyover. When schools gave over, vehicles had to take the road below and clogged Park Circus. In the north, traffic sergeants complained of a couple of broken down traffic lights, but Lalbazar denied all such claims. “South Kolkata was worse off than the north,” said an officer.
