CHENNAI: After close to three weeks of protesting, government doctors' associations called off their agitation and returned to work on Monday.
The white-coats have been on strike since the Madurai bench of the Madras high court overruled the method followed by   for PG admissions.
 
 It asked the state to follow the one prescribed by the   (MCI), and did away with the 50% quota for government doctors. Last week, the high court reached a split verdict on the case and placed it before a single judge. On Saturday, the court ruled that the state should follow MCI regulations. The order also resulted in a windfall for doctors in government service vying for the 3,000 PG seats, as 80% would go to in-service candidates who are eligible to claim incentive marks for admissions, as stipulated in the regulations.
 
 Dr  , president of Tamil Nadu Government Doctors' Association (TNGDA), said the strike had been called off on Sunday night. “Although we are still, in principle, against the high court order, the state government has assured us that it will file an appeal in the Supreme Court. TNGDA will also implead in the case,“ he said.
 
 Around 15,000 doctors had either participated in or supported the agitation, of which close to 8,000 are PG aspirants.
