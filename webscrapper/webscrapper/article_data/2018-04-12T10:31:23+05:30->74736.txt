HYDERABAD: Days after the police department proposed that some rape cases should be heard at child-friendly special court, five pending cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act came up for hearing at child-friendly court on Wednesday. It has been decided that The Special Court for Trial of Offences Under POCSO Act will function twice a week — Wednesday and Thursday. Additional Sessions Judge   took charge as the special court judge.

 With low conviction rate in rape cases and increasing pending cases in courts, the She Team proposed that along with POCSO cases, rape cases should also be tried at child-friendly court, inaugurated on Saturday. “Rape victims are victimized again during the trial and it takes months and years for a judgment to be passed in these cases. So we have proposed that severe rape cases should also be tried in this special court,” said Swati Lakra, IGP (Law & Order), women safety.
 
 
 According to She Team officials, it takes over two years to get a judgment in rape cases and by that time the victims opt for a compromise due to delay. “If the cases get diverted to special court, we can expect a judgment in six months. It will be a relief for victims and they will be given facilities provided to minor rape and abuse victims,” said ACP Kavitha, She Teams.
 
 State women and child department will provide ?2.5 crore funding to child-friendly special court.
