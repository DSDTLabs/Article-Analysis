CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed a PIL seeking a direction to the Chennai commissioner of police not to permit a protest by the   against the NEET medical entrance examination, which the party had planned for Thursday. 

 When the plea by   came up for hearing, the government pleader submitted that the commissioner has already denied the DMK permission to hold the protest.
 
 According to Saravanan's petition, any protest against NEET would be against a judgment of the Supreme Court. 
 
 Recording the submission, the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee said, "There can be no doubt that if there is any illegal activity, action would have to be taken. However, order cannot be issued in anticipation. The petition has become unfruitful by reason of the order refusing to grant permission to the party concerned to hold the protest."
