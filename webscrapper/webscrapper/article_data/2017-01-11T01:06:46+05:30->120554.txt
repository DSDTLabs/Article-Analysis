CHENNAI: The cash crunch that resulted from the Centre’s   policy and political uncertainty in the state have badly dented the Chennai   sector. A notional revenue loss of nearly Rs 1100 crore was recorded between October and December 2016, a report by a global property consultant has revealed.

 The half yearly report of   says new housing project launches plummeted by 29%, while there was a relatively restrained decline of 9% in sales compared to 2015. “New launches for 10,615 units was reported and 16,187 units were sold during 2016,” Knight Frank India director (Chennai) Kanchana Krishnan told reporters here. In 2015, nearly 15,000 new units were launched and around 18000 new units sold.
 
 On the notional loss, she said, “Had demonetisation not happened you would have not incurred this loss (of Rs 1100 crore)...The notional loss was largely pertaining to residential apartments.”
 
 The last year recorded the lowest launches and sales in the country since the 2008 global financial crisis. And Chennai was at the bottom, having seen a gradual decline in launches of residential projects and sales since 2012. Around 30,926 units remained unsold in 2016.
 
 The report threw up some surprises elements, as well. West Chennai, which had been one of the best performing and affordable markets in the last two years, took a beating. Between July and December last year, western pockets of the city registered a significant 18% drop in number of launches.  , however, reported a 4% spike in sales cent during the same period. “Central Chennai had witnessed new launches and re-launches in 2016. It had 3-4 big launches,” she said, adding that it was one of the surprises.
 
 On the flip side, the Chennai office market scaled new heights with 5.3 million square feet being absorbed in 2016.
 
 On the projection for 2017, Kanchana said the first half may not be very robust. “This year (2017) may be a very average year in our opinion,” she added.
