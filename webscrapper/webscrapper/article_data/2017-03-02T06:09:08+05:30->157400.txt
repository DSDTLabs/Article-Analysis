Navi Mumbai: A high-level team led by chief minister  , the   MD and the joint MD is in Delhi to push for the forest clearance required to blast and cut the Ulwe hill for the new international   .

 “We have submitted it (papers) again and are hopeful of getting the clearance in a week’s time,” joint MD Prajakta Chavan said on Wednesday.
 
 The approval is required as a 261-hectare forested patch — it covers a part of the future core aeronautical area — spans the hill. The Ulwe river also flows across a section of the hill and is to be diverted in the pre-development works.
