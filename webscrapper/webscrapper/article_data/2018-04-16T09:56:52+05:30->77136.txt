PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s wife and former   CM   shot off a second letter to Bihar CM   on Sunday demanding a detailed explanation for removal of security guards from her residence and the officers responsible for it.

 Writing under her personal letterhead, she questioned, “First, I must get a reply and report why the security was withdrawn from 10 Circular   on April 10 midnight without any formal letter and at whose orders? I need explanation.”
 
 The house guards comprising 17 jawans of BMP-2 were withdrawn on April 10 night. An angry   wrote a letter to the CM on April 11 informing that she was returning all security personnel and escort vehicles deployed at her residence.
 
 The matter could not be settled even after CM   ordered restoration of the security to her house on April 12. 
 
 Rabri, in her letter on Sunday, stated: “Why the police officials were not picking the repetitive calls made by former deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav and former minister Tej Pratap Yadav (after removal of security guards on April 10)?”
 
 She has also cautioned the home department and its minister in charge, who is Nitish, would be held responsible in case of any untoward incident with her family. 
 
 She alleged in her letter that the state government is conspiring to kill her family. “RJD leader   even wrote several letters to the home department, seeking the reply on removal of Z-plus category security. But they haven’t given any reply so far,” Rabri wrote in the letter.
 
 She also alleged that from 2005 onwards, the security at 10, Circular Road was weakened. “Being a former CM of Bihar, I should also be given Z-plus security,” she wrote.
