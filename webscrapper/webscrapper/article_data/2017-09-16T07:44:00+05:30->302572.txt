Amritsar: Undeterred by the party’s dismal performance in the Punjab assembly elections, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is all set to put its might behind the BJP candidate for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha byelection.

 Talking to newspersons in Amritsar on Friday, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “BJP will take a call on its nominee but the SAD will extend full support to ensure victory of our joint candidate.”
 
 When asked that voters had lost faith in the SAD-BJP combine during the assembly elections, Sukhbir said, “This is the beauty of democracy. Public holds power in its hands in a democratic set up. It’s the public that can make a king, a pauper and vice versa. People in Punjab have seen and experienced in the past six months that there is no government.” Disenchantment with the Congress would ensure the joint candidate’s victory, he said.
 
 The former deputy chief minister said a joint meeting of the SAD and the BJP had been scheduled for September 18 at Chandigarh to discuss the joint strategy for the bypoll.
 
 When asked about Rahul Gandhi’s drug addiction comment about youths of Punjab, Sukhbir said after recent survey by the PGIMER recording that there was less than 1% drug addiction in Punjab, the Congress leadership was hiding its face and finding excuses.
 
 He said the SAD had then denied the allegations with evidence but no one listened to it. “PPCC president Sunil Jakhar has been claiming that drug addiction has come down under Captain Amarinder Singh’s government. The PGI’s survey was held in 2016 during the Badal government, what can be more ridiculous than this,” he said.
 
 Taking a dig at cabinet ministers Navjot Singh Sidhu and Manpreet Singh Badal, the SAD chief said both of them didn’t deserve the portfolios they had been given. He alleged that the ruling Congress had backtracked from its pre-poll promise of a complete loan waiver of Rs 90,000 crore to farmers and had now come down to write off only Rs 15,000 crore.
