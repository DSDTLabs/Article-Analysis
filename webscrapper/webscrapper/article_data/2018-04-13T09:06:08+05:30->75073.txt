AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old businessman has accused a woman from Abdasa, Manisha Goswami, her husband Gajjugiri   and two others of blackmailing him using a video the accused filmed after drugging the businessman.

 The businessman, a resident of Naroda, has lodged an FIR with Naroda police. The businessman is seen in a compromising position with an unknown woman in the video in question.
 
 Naroda police sources said Manisha Goswami demanded Rs 10 crore from the businessman and he had already paid her Rs 55 lakh in two instalments. As the demands of the accused did not stop, he was forced to lodge a complaint.
 
 “We are tracking the accused and will arrest them soon,” said a senior police official.
 
 According to police sources, the victim met Manisha Goswami five years ago while on a business trip to Abdasa.
 
 “Three months ago, Manisha phoned him up and called him to a community guest house near  , saying that a relative of hers was admitted to the hospital. As soon as the businessman entered a room in the guest house, a chemical was sprayed on him after which he fell unconscious. He found himself alone in the room when he woke up,” a police official said.
 
 According to the FIR, in February, Goswami came near his house and forced herself into his car. “She showed him a video clip of him in a compromising position with an unknown woman. She told him to give her Rs 10 crore or she would publish the video on social media,” added a police source.
 
 The businessman was afraid and approached his uncle, Jayanti Bhanushali. “The two of them met Goswami and paid her Rs 55 lakh in two instalments. When they realised she would not demanding more money, they have lodged an FIR,” a senior Naroda police official said.
