A 58-year-old man, who claims to be singer  's boyfriend, has told the police that he needs a gun to protect her in  .

  
  
 
 Reportedly, according to the police in  , a man was at the station for voluntary questioning on an unrelated case when he bragged he was the singer's boyfriend.
 
 "He went as far as showing them texts with a 'Taylor Swift' as the recipient," said the police officials. 
 
 The police got suspicious when he started asking how many states he can drive through with a concealed carry weapons permit. He also told the police he wanted a gun to protect Taylor in Africa. 
 
 However, it is unclear why he thinks Swift will be in Africa.
 
 The police could not detain the man as 'someone simply saying they want a gun to protect someone is not a crime'.
 
 The officials are trying to contact Swift's team to warn her.
