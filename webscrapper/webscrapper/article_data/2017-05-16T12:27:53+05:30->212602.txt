RANCHI:   will be available in abundance this year as  , planted by 10,000   across the state, has borne more   as compared to the last year. 

 According to the scientists of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) Horticulture Centre at Plandu in Namkum, mango production this year will be approximately five lakh tonnes. The fruit is grown over 50,000 hectares of land in districts like Gumla, Hazaribagh, Lohardaga and Ranchi. 
 
 "Last year the state's mango production was 30 percent less as compared to this year due to heavy rainfall and thunderstorm which occurred in mid-March and damaged flowers," said Bikash Das, fruit scientist of ICAR Plandu. He added that this year since there was no rainfall in March, mango bearing plants were not affected by diseases like inflorescence bligth which spoils florets before they get nurtured into fruits. 
 
 "Whatever mangoes are being sold in the state is brought from   which lacks sweetness. We will get mangoes grown in Jharkhand only in the fourth week of May," Das added.
