Though there was a time when movie actors thought twice about venturing into television, the scenario has been changing since megastars of the likes of Amitabh Bachchan,  , Aamir Khan and even   decided to change the status quo and host TV shows. We spoke to actress   about the same. Said the actress. "The earlier concept of screen jodis and hero-heroines is no longer relevant, as smart phones and social media have brought stars much closer to the audience. There’s hardly any mystery left when it comes to the lives of stars. Moreover, people now believe in performers. And if a star’s acting is good, I really don’t feel TV will take away from their popularity. I, however, feel that in  , the word ‘star’ ended with   and Suchitra Sen. Besides films, I’m happily working in the serial Bhoomi Kanya. Four Bengali films can’t earn me what I am getting here. We have to survive too. I am an actor and I want to reach as many people as possible.TV helps me do just that."
