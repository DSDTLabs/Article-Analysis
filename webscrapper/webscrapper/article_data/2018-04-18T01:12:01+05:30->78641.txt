NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old youth was   alive when loose earth gave way at a construction   in Dwarka Vihar. Police said that Delhi Jal Board had contracted the work of laying a pipeline to a cement company in Janakpuri and the victim had recently started working there. 

 Police said the victim, Mohammad Umar, was from Khagaria in Bihar. He had shifted to Delhi just a month ago and shared a rented room with other contractual labourers. On Tuesday, he left for work at 6am. While at the site, he was asked to check the area where the pipeline was to be laid. Umar lowered himself into the pit. While he was at a depth of eight feet, loose earth around him gave way, burying him completely. 
 
 “He tried to call for help but none of us could do anything. One of us made a PCR call, but he was trapped for so long that he couldn’t have held onto his breath until help arrived,” said a co-worker. 
 
 A police rescue team pulled out Umar and rushed him to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. 
 
 Police said the workers alleged that they were not given proper gear to carry out the work nor was any safety measure adopted at the site. DJB officials, however, were clueless about the incident and said they were trying to find out if such an incident had occurred at all. 
 
 The workers also told the police that there was no junior engineer at the site to guide them. Police said they have sought for answers from senior officials. 
 
 DCP (Dwarka) Shibesh Singh said a case has been registered at the Chhawla police station.
