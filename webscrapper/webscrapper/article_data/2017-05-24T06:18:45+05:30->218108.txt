HYDERABAD: The state government has proposed to introduce daily dose of medicine for   (TB) patients. At present,   are given   every alternate day. In a bid to ensure compliance, the state government is intending to recommend the same dose. 

 Officials of the Central Tuberculosis Division (TBD), a national body meant for issuing guidelines on   treatment, will visit the state soon in this connection.
 
 "We propose to decrease the dose of medicines and increase frequency. This will introduce the new fixed dose base (FDB) for TB patients. Daily dose of medicines is at present given to TB patients with HIV co-infection," said Dr Ch Surya Prakash, joint director (TB) of the state health department.
 
 The daily FDB for TB patients is already being implemented by states like Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. The Centre has asked the Telangana government to implement the programme in a phased manner, he added.
 
 Officials said that in thrice-a-week schedule, patients take seven tablets a day. Now, the dose will come down to two or three tablets daily. "Even private practitioners prefer daily FDB," he said.
 
 Training will be given to private doctors and government hospital staff, including nurses, on the proposed drug regimen. The training sessions will conclude by July. However, the new treatment programme will be implemented in a phased manner so that there is no shortage of drugs. The dosage of the daily tablets will also be lowered in time.
 
 The Union health ministry has also flavoured TB pills in five states, including Himachal Pradesh and Kerala, on trial basis this year. These tablets were also introduced in Telangana.
