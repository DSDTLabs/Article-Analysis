The walk-in closet is my favourite corner at home. It has everything I need and I love spending time there. I am quite possessive about the stuff I store in the cupboard. It has a couple of brands that I have worked hard to own. Getting ready or just getting the best light for pictures or settling in with a book... I love doing all of it in here.

 
 This particular corner, which is my favourite in the house, signifies my spirituality, as there is a Ganpati idol in the background. This is where I do my tarot readings and practise meditation. This is also the most peaceful place in my home as I feel I am surrounded by positive energies here. There’s also a water fountain Shivalinga here, which brings me peace and tranquillity.
 
 
 My favourite corner in my house is by my window, from where I love begin my mornings. Over a cup of coffee, I start my day, reading scripts and making plans. I like to call it my corner of solitude where I can think and contemplate. It also helps me visualise my character and the scenes which are about to be shot later in the day, when I read scripts perched up there.
 
 
  
 
 
  
 My favourite corner is by the charging docket in my living room. I sit here because it’s easiest to charge my gadgets here. Under the table are my books. This corner also gives me a clear view of my balcony from where I can watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea. I love to read and work on my laptop in this corner. 
 
 
 I love to click all my pictures and record videos in front of the ‘infamous’ purple wall in my home. Why infamous? Well, that’s a tag given by my followers on social media. Purple happens to be my favourite colour and hence, when I moved into this house, I chose the colour for this one wall. Also, the pattern on the wall is of my choice. I like to sit here, resting my back against it.
