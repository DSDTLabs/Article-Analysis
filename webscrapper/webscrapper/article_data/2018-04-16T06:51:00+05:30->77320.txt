Ranchi: A jeweller from Patna said a group of criminals looted Rs 1.32 crore in cash and around 4.5kg of gold from him at Rajouli valley under Koderma police station area around 9:30pm on Saturday. The victim was on his way to Coimbatore in his vehicle when the incident took place.

 Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Phulwari Sharif area of Patna, complained to the police that as soon as he reached Koderma valley, the criminals who were travelling in another vehicle forced him to stop his car in the middle of the road. Three of the miscreants boarded his vehicle and after travelling for some distance, they forced Rajesh and his driver out of the car and then fled with the vehicle which contained the valuables.
 
 Rajesh said, “I was supposed to buy silver utensils and ornaments with the cash. The gold, on the other hand, was to be used for getting jewellery from Coimbatore.”
 
 A police officer said a case (73/18) has been registered in connection with the incident under Section 352 of the IPC. Teams have been sent to several places, including Bihar, to nab the criminals.
 
 Rajesh said he suspects two of his drivers. He said they must have something to do with it as they were the only ones who knew that he was carrying valuables.
 
 Koderma SP Shivani Tewary said an inspector-level officer has been asked to investigate the case.
