PANAJI: The tourism department has forwarded the final draft of the tender for beach cleaning to the government even as it made it clear that it doesn’t have the technical capability to carry out the task.

 A source said, “Tourism department has sent the draft to the government after making some changes but the file has not come back to us.”
 
 While mechanical beach cleaning has not been proposed, the officer said they have suggested that the responsibility of beach cleaning be handed over to a corporation or any other government body which has technical expertise.
 
 The tourism department drew flak from activists after it included mechanical beach cleaning in the controversial beach cleaning contract awarded to Bhumika Cleantech Pvt Ltd, and Ramcleaners and Developers Pvt Ltd, which was later cancelled in September 2016.
 
 The government was compelled to revoke the contract with the two agencies after the opposition and environmentalists termed the contract a big scam. The   had advised that the government refer the matter to the country’s premier investigation agency.
 
 A source said the issue has been pending primarily because chief minister   was not inclined to rest the responsibility with the tourism department. It was expected that Goa Solid Waste Management Corporation would be entrusted with the task.
 
 On the other hand, tourism minister   ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar has been on record saying beach cleaning will be carried out by the tourism department. A source said it is unlikely that beach cleaning would be handed over to any other department other than the tourism department.
