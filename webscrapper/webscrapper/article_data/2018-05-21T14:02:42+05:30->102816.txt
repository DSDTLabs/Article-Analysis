RAJKOT: The opposition   in the   ( ) on Friday demanded that the civic body should remove the column on religion from the form that a person is required to fill for registration in a hawkers’ zone.

 
 RMC said that seeking details of religion was not a new thing. “It his an old form we have not included any new column. Similar details have been sought earlier also. This is to get the complete details of the person who is doing business in hawkers’ zone,” said RMC commissioner Banccha Nidhi Pani. 
 
 Congress corporator   said, “No business is carried on the bases of religion and it’s clear that   wants to divide the hawkers on the communal lines. RMC does not need to know a person’s religion while allotting him/her space in hawkers’ zone.”
 
 As per policy of central government every municipal corporation has to provide hawkers with space to do business. It gives the legality to their business as well as eases encroachment on roads.
