This sundowner party at a star hotel was all about letting your hair loose and grooving to popular English numbers, by the poolside. DJ Ajmal spun latest hits, making the party goers dance like there was no tomorrow. Harini looked stunning in a printed palazzo that she wore with a white top. Jayashree’s bodycon skirt that she paired with a sheer black top made her look all glam. Also, we couldn’t take our eyes off Prateeksha’s long tresses!
