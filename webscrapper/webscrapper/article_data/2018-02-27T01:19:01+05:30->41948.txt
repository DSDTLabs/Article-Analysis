NEW DELHI: A   on Monday   its   on the   filed by   and Prakash Jarwal, who are accused of allegedly   Delhi chief secretary  . 

 This is the second occasion when the legislators have sought bail. A magisterial court on Friday had dismissed their bail plea, calling the MLAs “history-sheeters”, and saying there was prima facie “a premeditated criminal conspiracy”.
 
 Meanwhile, Delhi Police informed additional sessions judge Anju Bajaj Chandana that the meeting between Prakash and   was not held in the camp office but in the drawing room of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence. 
 
 Seeking bail, defence lawyers BS Joon and Irshad argued that offences against their clients were not made out, since FIR was filed for injury without any medico-legal report. “He is not a history-sheeter because there are no convictions,” Joon argued before the court.
 
 The two legislators have been charged under the Indian Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty (Section 332), assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty (Section 353) and criminal conspiracy (Section 120B) for the purported attack on Prakash.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Atul Srivastava opposed the bail plea, arguing the two legislators were already embroiled in several cases. The court was also informed by the police that the site visit revealed discrepancies in the timing of the CCTV footage. “Only FSL will be able to tell if any tampering has been done,” the court was informed.
 
 Earlier, the defence had argued that the accusations against their client were “completely false and fabricated”, made with the ulterior motive to “destabilise the government of Delhi”. The defence also said the “personal vendetta” between Centre and the state government was behind this case. The counsels refuted it was a criminal conspiracy, and also argued there was no plausible explanation for the long delay in registering the FIR.
