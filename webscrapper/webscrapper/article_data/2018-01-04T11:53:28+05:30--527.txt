LUCKNOW : As   continued to lash the city, cold conditions intensified despite relief from dense fog on Wednesday.

 Similar conditions will prevail on Thursday. The   predicted that thick fog would ease in the coming days, but night temperature would gradually fall.
 
 Though temperature and humidity levels during the day time were almost similar to Tuesday’s, experts said that people felt biting cold because of increase in the wind speed.
 
  
 “On comparing weather data of Tuesday and Wednesday, we found that all factors were similar but wind speed on Wednesday was almost double that of Tuesday. The increase in velocity caused ‘wind chill’ impact which aggravated cold conditions,” said Prof Dhruvsen Singh from the weather monitoring cell in the department of geology at  .
 
 The maximum temperature recorded at Amausi was 15.5 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal, and minimum temperature was 7.3 degrees Celsius. Thick dense fog enveloped the city on Tuesday night itself and prevailed till 1pm. Visibility was around 500 metres at 8pm. Sunshine in the afternoon did not bring desired relief due to bone-chilling winds.
 
  director JP Gupta said the prevailing cold conditions were likely to continue till Saturday. Density of fog will gradually reduce but night temperature will fall. Clear sky is expected next week.
