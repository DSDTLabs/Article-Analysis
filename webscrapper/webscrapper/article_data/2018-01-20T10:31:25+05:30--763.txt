COIMBATORE: The city, with a population of 20 lakh, has only 2,500 policemen to protect its peace-loving citizens. That’s why the city police is looking for volunteers, who are ready to burn the midnight oil, to keep a watch on the neighbourhood.

 The city police soon plan to meet resident welfare associations in search of 60 people from each locality to volunteer for the task. Every night, two of them would go for patrol from 10pm to 3am. They should keep watch on strangers in the locality and inform police about suspicious characters.
 
 “We are going to meet resident welfare associations in the city and ask them to provide 60 people from each locality. Every night, we will ask two people to go for night patrol in their respective areas. They don’t need to catch suspects. They can inform the night patrol police team about strangers and our men will rush to the spot for further action,” said city police commissioner K  .
 
 “We have also requested shopkeepers to fix   cameras inside and outside their shops. Many resident welfare associations have come forward to install surveillance cameras to monitor their surroundings round-the-clock. Such initiatives will help us curb crimes,” Periaiah told TOI.
 
 Police also plan to conduct meetings with cab drivers, autorickshaw drivers and private security guards, who work during night hours. “We arrested an eight-member ATM burglary gang after a cab driver gave us a tip-off. Police cannot cover each and every street. But, cab drivers go to many places to pick-up and drop passengers. We will give them the contact numbers of police officers, so that they can inform us about crimes,” said Periaiah.
 
 Public can also use the WhatsApp number 8190000100 to register grievances. “We plan to display the number in   and private buses,” the senior officer added.
