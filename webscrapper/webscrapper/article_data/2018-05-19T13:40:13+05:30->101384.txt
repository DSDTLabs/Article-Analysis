RAJKOT: A Mumbai resident was arrested from Andheri on Friday for allegedly trying to extort Rs five lakh for former   MLA and minister   by faking as henchman of underworld don Ravi Pujari.

 The arrested accused Ashishkumar Sharma, 25, had called up Kavadiya on his cell phone when the latter was at his house in   in   town. Sharma identified himself Arjun and said he was Pujari’s man. Sharma told him to cough up Rs five lakh and threatened to eliminate him and his family members if he did pay.
 
 Kavadiya was the minister for panchayat and rural housing and development in the former chief minister Anandiben Patel government. 
 
 “The first call to Kavadiya was made on Wednesday. He also sent threatening text messages, following which the BJP leader’s personal assistant Ravindra Sanawada approached us. On the basis of his number, we traced him to Anandnagar locality in Oshiwara of Andheri suburb. We laid a trap with the help of anti-extortion cell of Mumbai police and asked him to come and collect the extortion amount. As soon as Sharma arrived at the spot, we nabbed him,” said R T Vyas, sub-inspector, Morbi local crime branch.
 
 LCB sources said that Sharma had earlier worked as an assistant director for some C-grade films in Mumbai and had similarly threatened a few artists and demanded money. He had gone the number of Kavadiya from some website, probably the latter’s ceramic factory or some government portal.
