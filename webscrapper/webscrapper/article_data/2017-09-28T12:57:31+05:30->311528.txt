AHMEDABAD:   (15) knows that a little boy has saved his life. “I don’t know his name but he has saved me from  . Once I am well I would like to meet his parents and say thank you,” Pankaj says. The  , who is a class X student, had almost lost his childhood to kidney failure. He endured dialysis thrice a week till 14-month-old   were transplanted inside him early in September this year. 

 This was reportedly a cadaver donation from the youngest person in western India. Somnath, of Surat, had been declared brain dead after sustaining brain haemorrhage from a fall off a ladder while playing. A fortnight later, the two little kidneys — measuring 6 cm each — are working wonderfully inside Pankaj. His creatinine levels, which indicate kidney function, have become normal. Before the transplant they were constantly haywire.
 
 “The paediatric transplant is a success. Since Somnath was only 14 months old, both his kidneys were transplanted so that they give the best medical results,” said Dr Jamal Rizvi, a transplant surgeon, of the   (IKDRC). “Pankaj is eating, drinking and doing very well. He should be fine.” Had only one kidney been transplanted, kidney function would have been have compromised, Rizvi said.
 
 Pankaj, who remembers suffering from severe vomiting and painful urination, is now looking forward to going to school. “I do not want to become a doctor as they poke too many needles. I will decided on what I will become later,” Pankaj said. 
 
 IKDRC authorities said that this is the fourth cadaver transplant of a donor under five years of age. “Earlier, young donors included a three-year-old girl, Trisha, who had fallen from off a window; Arpita who was became brain dead after a snake bite; and Priyansh who fell from a window while playing.”
