Nagpur: It was a great experience for budding entrepreneurs of the city as they got to listen to the dos and don’ts of sales and marketing at a programme which is part of The Indus Entrepreneurs’ IMPACT (TIE IMPACT). 

 Speaking on the occasion at Chitnavis Centre, Christine Quinn, professor of Denver University, USA, and a corporate expert, said, “As an entrepreneur, the most important thing is to know where you are standing, where you want to be and the gap between.”
 
 She then proceeded to address the five most common sales and marketing mistakes entrepreneurs make. 
 
 “Failure to pivot quick enough in start-up process when sales and marketing require dedicated effort, failure to operationally support and grow existing customers, failure to ask existing customers for referrals, too much focus on product features and not benefits and not enough investment in marketing on the front are the few mistakes you can make.”
 
 According to Quinn, the secret mantra to getting clients is using the words ‘is, does, means’ during the meeting. She explained that usage of these words instead of only ‘is’ will benefit their cause. “It is also essential that you get your most important customers to stay with you. You should reward them for their loyalty through programmes and VIP treatment.”
 
 She urged the audience to ask themselves, “How many customers do you have?” “How many do you want?” and “How many you can get?” Quinn urged the entrepreneurs to keep their customers in loop. “Old-fashioned e-mail blast marketing works better than social media marketing,” she said.
 
 The session ended with a question-and-answer session with Quinn.
