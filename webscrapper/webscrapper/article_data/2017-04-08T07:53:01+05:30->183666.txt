SALEM: As many as 12 members belonging to seven families of   near   railway station in   taluk, who had converted to Christianity 10 years ago, attempted to immolate themselves at the   district collectorate on Thursday. They alleged harassment by their villagers for not donating money for the local temple festival. 

 Police personnel at the collectorate stopped the 12 people, including women and kids, from setting themselves ablaze by seizing the kerosene cans from them.
 
 V  , 28, one of the people who tried to immolate themselves, told reporters that seven families, including his, had converted to Christianity about 10 years ago. "The villagers approached our families demanding a donation of 2,000 each for the local Mariamman temple festival, which was held on Friday. We refused to pay the amount saying we didn't want to attend the festival," he said. 
 
 Following this, a section of villagers on Saturday disconnected the local water supply lines to their houses and also damaged water tanks, Raman said. "The villagers also placed thorny bushes in front of our houses," he added.
 
 All the seven families on Monday lodged a complaint with the Theevattipatti police and revenue officials. "Both the police and revenue officials did not accept our complaints," Raman alleged.
 
 On Thursday, 12 members from the seven families went to the Salem collectorate with kerosene cans. The police seized the kerosene cans. However, Raman doused himself with kerosene and threatened to set himself on fire if the police attempted to move him out. The police personnel overpowered him and poured water on him.
 
 The police then asked Raman and others to petition collectorate officials. Following this, they petitioned the revenue officials, who assured them they would forward the petition to the district collector and the district SP.
