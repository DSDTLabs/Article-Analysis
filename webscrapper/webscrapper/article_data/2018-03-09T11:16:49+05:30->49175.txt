PUNE: The inspector-general of police,  , has directed Kolhapur, Pune rural, Sangli, Satara, and Solapur rural superintendents of police to organize an awareness week against animal cruelty, coinciding with the sugar cane harvest season.

 The move was in response to a request from an  , Animal Rahat, whose veterinarians claimed to have witnessed abuse and suffering of bullocks during sugar cane harvest season.
 
 In its letter to the inspector general of police, the NGO pointed out that illegal practices such as overloading sugar cane carts; beating, whipping, and using painful torture devices to prod bullocks; and forcing sick and lame bullocks to work are common at sugar factories and along the roads leading to these facilities.
 
 “During Animal Cruelty Awareness Week, district police will inform bullock owners and enforce animal protection laws, including Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960; Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules, 1965; and directives of the   Commissioner of Sugar in 2012.
 
 “The peak of sugar cane harvesting season means the height of suffering for bullocks which are illegally beaten in order to force them to pull backbreaking loads under the hot sun for many miles," said Animal Rahat chief operating officer Naresh Upreti.
 
 The activities prohibited under India's animal-protection laws include hitching unequally sized animals to the same cart, exceeding a weight limit of 1.5 to 1.8 tons per cart and forcing a bullock to work for more than nine hours a day and for five hours without adequate rest or break.
 
 Even forcing animals to work between noon and 3pm, if temperatures exceed 37°C, is also prohibited by law.
 
 The law also doesn’t allow using any spiked stick, bit, harness, or yoke with spikes or any other sharp tackle or equipment that inflicts pain on an animal. The acts of beating, overloading, or torturing animals or causing them any unnecessary pain or suffering are also illegal, besides forcing aged, ill, or injured animals to work.
