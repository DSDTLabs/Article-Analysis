 The onset of asthma could occur even before one was born. Dr Alok Chandra, senior chest physician at MLN Medical College, said an infant may suffer from neo-natal jaundice for which phototherapy is given but if it is given for more than the required time then it can lead to the development of bronchial asthma in the child. 
 
  Dr Chandra also talked about the importance of the environmental factors as they play a major role. Environmental factors, such as dust, smoke, pollen grains, insects, chaff and poor air quality could trigger asthma attacks in a person. The symptoms include tightness in the chest, persistent coughing and recurring breathlessness, he said.
 
 Treatment along with education is the best way to tackle asthma. Awareness among patients is required to control it. The patients should get allergy test done so that they know what trigger an attack. Also, they should take their medicines regularly along with the inhalers. Patients should not stop medication as that can increase the frequency of attacks. Asthma cannot be completely cured, it can only be controlled, he said. Dr Chandra also listed out what should be avoided to reduce attacks and to prevent precipitation of asthma in those with a family history. He said smoking should be strictly avoided.
