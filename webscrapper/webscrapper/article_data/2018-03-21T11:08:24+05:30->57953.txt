PUNE: Passengers travelling on trains between Pune and   will soon be able to buy unreserved tickets on their smartphones. 

 Officials from of the Pune division of   said on Tuesday that passengers can buy the tickets using the   mobile application, which is available on   Play Store. Users in the Pune division will be able to book their tickets within a week.
 
 “Around 1.12 lakh passengers travel between Pune and Lonavla everyday. We are sure that suburban passengers will benefit from (the app),” an official said.
 
 “One can book the tickets using the application, and the e-tickets will be accepted by ticket inspectors. The app has a ‘show ticket’ option and the ticket can be accessed even without an Internet connection. However, such tickets are not transferable, neither can they be cancelled,” an official said.
 
 There is a caveat, however: The tickets can only be booked from outside a 2km radius of the railway station. “Geo-fencing prevents the app from being used within this radius,” another official said. “Passengers can only access areas that fall within this radius with a ticket, so the app cannot be used,” the official explained. 
 
 Tickets can be paid for using the R-wallet, which can be recharged online, at a UTS counter, or on ‘utsonmobile.indian.rail.gov.in’.
