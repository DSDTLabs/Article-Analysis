VADODARA: The   (VMC) on Thursday night razed the   opposite the railway station. The VMC had issued a notice to the shops there stating that they were dilapidated.

 Removing the shopping centre was needed for the station area   of the civic body. The project requires that several existing structures in the area are taken care of. A transport hub as well as a sprawling city square will come up in the area.
 
 Earlier, the civic body had razed its own Pravasi Gruh, Belbaug Shopping Centre, Station Shopping Centre and other structures in the area. The VMC had also started razing the Pathik Bhavan owned by the district panchayat as it was in a bad condition, but had to stop the work as the   ordered a status quo. 
 
 A little ahead on the Sayajigunj main road, the civic body has razed a petrol pump and a tyre repair shop even as the space used by the traffic police to park vehicles will be vacated soon.
 
 The shopkeepers at New Belbaug Shopping Centre were asked to vacate the shops in the evening. They have been assured that they would be given alternative spaces in the future. The shops were vacated by late in the evening following which the razing drive began.
 
  said that there were around 56 shops in the complex. “The bad condition of the shops is evident from the fact that we could raze them only in around 30 minutes. In the future, the road will now shift towards the compound wall of the university giving space to the transport hub,” said Rao.
