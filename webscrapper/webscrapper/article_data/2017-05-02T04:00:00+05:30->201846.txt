Vadodara: A 71-year-old resident of Ahmedabad was cheated by a city-based travel agent of Rs 99,000 by giving him a duplicate flight ticket.

 Kantilal Das, a resident of Maninagar in Ahmedabad, had come to the city to visit his friend early in April when he was recommended Dipshal Travels to book his ticket for the US. Police said that Avinash Prasad, owner of the travel agency, had blocked Das’s ticket in Delta Airlines sometime between April 7 and April 24 and had taken Rs 99,000 from him.
 
 However, after blocking the ticket, Prasand failed to confirm it and lied to Das that his PNR number would be updated few days before his boarding. But Das never received PNR number and all his attempts to contact Prasad failed. When Das went to his office at a commercial complex on Jetalpur Road, it was closed.
 
 “Since his shop was closed, we got Prasad’s details from the agreement that he had signed with the builder of the complex. We have seized his computer and are checking the data if he has cheated with other persons too,” said R K Rajput, Gotri police sub-inspector. 
 
 He added that Prasad used to operate from a shop in Fatehgunj but later moved to Jetalpur Road.
