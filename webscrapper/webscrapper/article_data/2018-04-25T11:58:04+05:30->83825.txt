MUMBAI:   has abandoned plans to sell its  . It has instead decided to reposition the subsidiary as an affordable housing finance provider. The new strategy is to develop skills for lending based on   and take advantage of the fiscal incentives provided to borrowers, developers and lenders. The housing finance arm will also diversify into consumer lending.

 
 The bank’s executive director and head of retail   has been appointed chairman of the housing finance company. Speaking to TOI, Bagchi said that the target is to triple the portfolio to Rs 30,000 crore in three to four years. The subsidiary has a new management in place with Anirudh Kamani, former head of rural and inclusive banking, to lead the housing finance arm.
 
 Around 2014, ICICI Bank had initiated plans to sell its housing finance arm and move all home loan activity to the bank. While the planned deal never went through, most of the housing finance activity did shift to the bank. Rajiv Sabharwal, who was heading the bank’s retail business, moved to head  .
 
 According to Bagchi, the affordable housing segment is set to see an explosion on the back of fiscal incentives and the government focus on this sector due to its impact on job creation. “We are present in 400 locations and, in another 18 months, we will be in present in more than 1,000 centres,” said Bagchi.
 
 He said the affordable housing business is better done through an arm because the bank’s operating costs are higher. Also, this business needs a special skill set. Additionally, these loans will be priced slightly higher to factor in the likelihood of a higher credit cost.
 
 “Unlike loans to salaried, these loans require special skills on lending based on income assessment,” said Bagchi. He said that some of the expertise is already there in business loans to the micro-segment.
