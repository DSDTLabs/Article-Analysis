CHANDIGARH: The arterial   connecting   in Sector 52 and   village to the   dividing road is uneven,  , and gravel ridden for a long time.

 One of its worst sections is opposite the Sector-43 bus stand. This rough surface is a difficult road for two-wheelers. The open ground and uneven terrain pose a challenge to even pedestrians and four-wheelers, as dust is blown into their faces and eyes. “The section is a dust blows because of its open surroundings,” said  , a cyclist from Anandpur Complex, who takes this road every day.
 
 The auto-rickshaw drivers and small vendors stationed close by said the windy weather from late-January to March behind aggravated the situation. Auto-rickshaw driver Sunny told TOI: “It is windy during the other months of the year as well but these three months are the windiest, when the dust blows a lot more.”
 
 Waseem, a barber working under a tree, said: “Due to the dust, the salon all gets dirty. Maybe, water should be sprinkled around this area to settle the dust.” Apart from the dust, the road also carries gravel and small stones that have created some uneven and some slippery patches. Light motor vehicles can ride over but two-wheelers and pedestrians cannot. “They usually come after March to repair the road, because that’s when it begins to get hotter, which is a conducive weather for road construction. I hope they start from this road this year,” said barber  .
