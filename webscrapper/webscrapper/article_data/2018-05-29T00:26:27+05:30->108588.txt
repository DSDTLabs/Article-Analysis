Salem: Farmers and residents of Veerapandi panchayat union here petitioned collector Rohini R Bhajibhakare on Monday demanding to drop the Chennai-Salem Green Corridor Express Highway project.

 The petitioners said their livelihood would be affected once the government procures agricultural lands along the corridor. “The lands along the highway are more fertile and our income would be affected if they were procured,” said M Pushpa, who was one among the 300-odd petitioners.
 
 A few days ago, villagers passed a resolution in a gram sabha meeting urging the government to drop the project. “But the district administration did not accept the resolution and asking us to alter it,” said K Aiyyandurai. 
 
 If the state and the central governments continue with the project, we would launch continous protests, said the petitioners.
 
 Earlier the day, police personnel outside the collectorate denied permission to the large gathering of petitioners and asked a few representatives to take the petition to the collector. Finally, eight villagers went inside the collector chamber and submitted the petition.
