GURUGRAM: A senior executive of a multi-national IT company has been booked for sexual harassment at workplace after a 50-year-old woman employee approached police against him.

 She claimed the company has not taken any action against the accused, despite several complaints to its internal complaints committee.
 
 According to the complainant, her ordeal began in March 2017 when the accused — her supervisor — started touching her appropriately in the office, located in Sector 48, many a time on one pretext or the other.
 
 The woman alleged she lodged a formal complaint against her immediate boss to the HR department and the internal complaints committee in May last year. But after getting no response, she followed it up with e-mails and meetings with senior HR executives. 
 
 “In one of the meetings, the deputy general manager had asked me to close the chapter,” she said in her complaint. She flatly refused and her ordeal continued as the supervisor started giving her poor rating and refused to sanction leaves, even those taken on medical grounds. Finally, she was forced by the HR department to go on leave from July last year.
 
 “Five other female employees had also recorded their statement to the internal complaints committee against the supervisor but the company still has not taken any action against the supervisor,” she said. “I had tried to resolve the matter within the company itself, but did not get any cooperation from the HR department, following which I am compelled to lodge a police complaint,” she said.
 
 Based on her complaint, an FIR has been registered against the supervisor under sections 354-D (stalking) and 354-A (sexual harassment) of IPC at Sadar police station. “We have initiated a probe. We will soon serve a notice to the company and the accused to join the investigation,” said inspector Vijay Kumar, SHO of Sadar police station.
