THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The only relief of the LDF government in ‘Saseendran tapes’ controversy will be the swiftness with which the accused minister submitted his resignation to chief minister  . It was 11.45am when the channel named AK Saseedran and within two hours the minister conveyed his decision to Vijayan.

 The chief minister, who had no qualms in asking his trusted lieutenant   to quit in October 2016, was more adamant this time. He had told the minister clearly that he expected him to do the best possible thing at this juncture. Saseendran picked up the hint and packed his bags.
 
 The second resignation in its first year in office has added to LDF’s woes. While there was a difference of opinion within the CPM over the need for resignation of Jayarajan, there was no such confusion this time. 
 
 Leaders, who were in the capital to attend the CPM state committee, had consulted each other quickly and there was no one to support the minister. 
 
 When Vijayan chose to speak to reporters by 1.30pm and termed the allegations serious, the fate of Saseendran was clear.
 
 Chances are bleak for the government to induct a new minister. The NCP, which has one more MLA, Thomas Chandy, will stake claim for the cabinet berth. But, sources said the CPM would buy time citing the Lok Sabha polls, and then the forthcoming assembly session. The decision of NCP MLA Churchill Alemao to support the BJP government in Goa would also go against NCP.
 
 CPM sources hinted that the party might sideline NCP and take over the ministerial berth. A section of the leadership has been favouring the re-entry of Jayarajan. The case of nepotism is now in the high court. If the HC quashesthe FIR, he will stake claim for the ministerial berth.
 
 Vijayan may even use this opportunity for a total cabinet revamp as several ministers were ranked average in the review conducted by the CPM state committee.
