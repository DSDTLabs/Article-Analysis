DHARAMSHALA: With assembly elections near in   and his tenure as a state minister coming to an end, Congress leader and transport minister G S Bali listed “works” done by him at a press conference on Wednesday. The minister is the first to do this in the incumbent government.

 Bali said he had been entrusted with three portfolios in the state cabinet: technical education, transport, and food and civil supplies. Bali credited Congress chief   for his cabinet berth. “I brought down losses from Rs 450 crore to Rs 351 crore in the transport department, while the fleet of state-owned buses has increased from 1,600 when I took over to 3,200 now,” he said, adding that women are getting a 25% discount on all state buses.
 
 Talking about technical education, he said four engineering colleges of the government were opened during his tenure. “Fourty-two ITI centers, and nine polytechnic colleges and colleges of architect, were opened,” he said.
 
 He went on to attack the BJP-led Centre, saying that it had stopped subsidy on sugar, but the state government continued to extend the reduced rates to families living below the poverty line. “Old ration cards were replaced with new smart cards. Depots were granted card-swapping machines” said Bali.
 
 At the meeting, he also announced to lift the ban on auto-rickshaws in Himachal. “I was told that new auto-rickshaws are not being registered. I declare that there is no such ban. If there is, I order to lift it. Registrations will be allowed for areas below the height of 4500m,” he said.
