  The showstopper for Naari (as the designer is lovingly called) was actor  . Dressed in a floral print black-and-white jacket and black pants, Angad reminded us of his athletic roots. 
 
 
  
 
  Talking about his collection to Bombay Times,   said, “The collection was funk, it was contemporary, it was athleisure, it was sports couture and it is something that people wear every day and look really smart in. This clothing is something that one could live in.” 
 
  When the actor was asked about hi personal style, he jokingly said, “I wear Narendra Kumar or nothing!”
 
 During the final walk, all the models, including Narendra Kumar and Angad Bedi, were seen dancing to some classics. The disco light above the center stage made the fashion gathering look more like a live party.
