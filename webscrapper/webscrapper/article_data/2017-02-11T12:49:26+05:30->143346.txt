PANAJI: Citing the recent   allocated to the health sector, senior lecturer in   at Kings College, London, Dr Sridhar Venkatapuram said lack of funding has been one of the major reasons for a poor health record of the country.

 “India will still be the lowest spenders on health programmes in the world despite progressive steps taken by India and the finance minister. The government in power today and in the past didn't give sufficient attention to health. Most of the catastrophic health problems in India are caused due to the low expenditure on health,” Venkatapuram said at the opening of the   conference, where various stakeholders will be contemplating on the challenges to the health services of the nation.
 
 Speaking at the conference, governor Mridula Sinha, who is also the brand ambassador of the Swacch Bharat campaign, highlighted the poor ranking of the country on the global health index.
 
 “India ranks at 143 out of 158 on the global health index which is a poor situation. We need to improve our health metrics. Through the Swacch Bharat campaign, we are also working towards providing better health facilities. One of the way through which we are doing it is by giving access to clean water,” Sinha shared, adding that the country is progressing well in terms of improving the health care for women, but there is still a long way to go.
 
 Sharing her insights on the country’s health care scenario, Dr Monica Lakhanpaul, professor of integrated community child health at the University College, London, said that the country’s healthcare problems are changing with times, with the rise in non-communicable diseases.
 
 “We need solutions for non-communicable diseases like diabetes and obesity which are on the rise among Indians,” she said, adding that an ideology shift is also necessary for mental health patients, who are still victims of social stigma associated with the diseases.
