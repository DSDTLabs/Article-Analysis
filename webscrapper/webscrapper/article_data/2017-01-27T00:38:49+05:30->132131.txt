SRINAGAR: A day after a major lost his life in a snowslide in Kashmir’s Sonmarg, 10 soldiers were killed and four were missing after two avalanches hit the   sector of the valley, an Army officer said on Thursday.

 An 
  of   district near the Line of Control late on Wednesday evening which trapped several soldiers, the Army officer said. He said rescue operations were launched and seven soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer, were pulled out. “The bodies of three soldiers were retrieved this morning," he said.
 
 The officer said another avalanche hit a patrol party which was on its way to a post in Gurez sector on Wednesday night. “Rescue teams have so far retrieved seven bodies from the spot of the incident,” the official said.
 
 He said search and rescue operations are on to find the missing soldiers.
 
 On Wednesday morning, Major Amit Sagar of the High Altitude Warfare School died when an Army camp of 115 Battalion was hit by an avalanche at Sonmarg in central Kashmir’s   district. The avalanche struck two shelters occupied by two officers and four jawans. While one officer and four soldiers were rescued and sent to hospital for treatment, Major Sagar succumbed.
 
 Gurez and Sonmarg are the same avalanche-prone sectors where 16 soldiers were killed and four injured in two snowslide-related incidents in March 2012. In February 2010, at least 15 Armymen were buried in snow after an avalanche hit a military camp in the Khilanmarg area near Gulmarg.
