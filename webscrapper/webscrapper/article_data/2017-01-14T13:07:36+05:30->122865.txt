PANAJI: Confident of an alliance with the   (GPCC),   strongman Atanasio Monserrate resigned as the St. Cruz MLA and joined the   (UGP) on Friday. Monserrate said a consensus has been reached between the   and UGP for a “friendly-fight” in Cortalim constituency.

 Launching his campaign as a UGP candidate and announcing his party’s ‘alliance’ with Congress, Monserrate vowed to remove off-shore casinos from the Mandovi river within six months of being elected to power.
 
 “I have seen that the people of Panaji have hardly received any job despite the chief minister representing the constituency. I don’t think it is difficult to give jobs. They are pushing for self-employment because they are not capable of creating jobs. They are just trying to pull wool over people’s eyes. It is the incapability of an MLA if he us unable to create employment,” Monserrate said.
 
 Even though the Congress has decided to field Gilbert Mariano Rodrigues in Cortalim, UGP’s Ramakant Borkar will contest from the same constituency. 
 
 “As far as Borkar is concerned, I have consulted him and he is fine with the Congress proposal. He is ready to contest in a friendly fight,” Monserrate said.
 
 When asked what a “friendly fight” meant, Monserrate said the idea emanated from the Congress ranks. “I don’t want secular votes to be split and this is a formative alliance as far as NCP, UGP and Goa Forward are concerned,” he added. Monserrate will file his nomination on January 17.
