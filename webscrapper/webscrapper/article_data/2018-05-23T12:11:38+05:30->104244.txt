TRICHY: The school education department must abstain from closing over 1,350 schools on the pretext of merging those with less student strength, says   ( ). If schools in their neighbourhood were closed, many rural children would be deprived of education, said the state president of the federation, M Manimehalai on the sidelines of the state executive committee. 

 While school education minister   had on Tuesday categorically denied reports on closure of schools, TNPTF said the statement was out of fear of backlash. “The school education minister has made a U-turn saying that they are only planning merger of schools. By merging students of one school with another, the government will be somehow closing one of the two,” she said. 
 
 The state government had a few weeks ago asked the district officials to identify schools with less than 10 students. Apart from 800 elementary schools, the government was also proposing to close around 550 welfare schools across the state and convert them into libraries, she said. On the one hand, the government was ensuring that children from disadvantaged sections joined private schools by way of RTE reservation. On the other hand, it was closing down government schools citing poor strength, she said. The federation feared that the directorate of elementary education might lose its significance if merged with school education department 
 
 TNPTF with over 45,000 teacher members has decided to join the indefinite hunger protest planned by   and Government Employees Organisations in this regard. TNN
