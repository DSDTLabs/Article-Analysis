MARGAO: Lakhs of devotees from various parts of South Goa, even as far as Betul and  , thronged to the Padre Pio Friary at   to venerate the   of   of Padua on Saturday. Volunteers and police personnel had a harrowing time controlling the long, serpentine queues.

 “The relics arrived much before schedule, at around 1.35pm. They were brought in a special, closed vehicle with police escort,” said organising committee member and South Goa additional collector Agnelo Fernandes.
 
 Media in-charge Fr   said, “The number of devotees who turned up for the public veneration was beyond our expectations. They arrived before dawn. The entire hillock was full.”
 
 The public veneration will conclude on March 4 with a thanksgiving Eucharistic celebration and final blessing at 3.30pm. “The relics will then be taken to the Dabolim airport from where they will be flown to Singapore,” Fr Fernandes said.
 
 South Goa episcopal vicar Fr   will be the main celebrant along with the Goa provincial minister Fr Waldheim Rodrigues, Fr Fernandes said, adding that Fr Rodrigues will be the main celebrant at the 6.30am mass, that will be followed by public veneration from 7.45am to 2.45pm.
