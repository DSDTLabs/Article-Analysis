INDORE: The work on   over bridge has begun once again and officials said work was in the last phase and would be  .

 “There were hindrances as the bridge is being constructed in coordination with the railways. We cannot carry out the work without approval from the railways which is why it took time,” a public works department official said.
 
 Officials said they were not expecting any more delays. They said they were expecting it to be done in a month.
 
 Earlier the construction work at the bridge was expected to start in January but got delayed as officials did not get a nod from the railways.
 
 The bridge has missed several deadlines. The officials had planned to construct the bridge before Simhastha. The work started on time. The work on one side of the bridge was completed but the department could not initiate work on the other side of the bridge. The department said the bridge would be opened by the end of February. However, it doesn’t seem that the bridge will be operational before March.
