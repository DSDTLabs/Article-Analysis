BENGALURU: A sea of fans draped in Bengaluruâ€™s blue and   yellow, 24,323 as per the official count, made it a memorable day for Indian football as they cheered each and every touch of their favourite team despite being an inconsequential   match which saw Bengaluru drown the visitors 2-0 in injury time here on Thursday.

 
 The deafening roar that followed the national anthem at the start was the culmination of the build-up which saw the Manjappada (The Yellow Army) matching the Blues in their Fortress - sound for sound and colour for colour throughout the 90 + 5 minutes.
 
 In the end, it was the Blue Army which brought the roof down as strikers Miku (90+1) and   (90+2) send the visitors packing and warmed up for the semifinals. Up against a near-full strength  , sans their two central defenders John Johnson and Juanan, Blasters still found the going tough.
