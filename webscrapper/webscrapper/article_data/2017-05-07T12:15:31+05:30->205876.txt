DEHRADUN: The income tax department has issued notices to banks, registrars and the Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam seeking details of UPRNN’s general manager S A   and his son, and contractor Amit Sharma in connection with the alleged violations of I-T rules in Uttarakhand.
 
  “Bank and land ownership details of last year will unravel the links between people involved in the case. Our teams are scrutinising voluminous documents seized during raids on different premises owned by them,” said an I-T official.
  
  The focus of I-T investigation is now on the financial transactions and property details of all the three and their family members.
  Refusing to divulge banks’ name, a senior I-T official said, “We have sought their transaction details for the past six years after their bank account details were found in seized documents.”
  
  I-T sleuths had on April 18 raided six premises, including a news channel owned by the contractor and farm houses reportedly owned by the general manager’s son   in Harbertpur on the outskirts of the hill capital.
  
  I-T sleuths have also issued notice to UPRNN, asking for details of all projects handled by the general manager and awarded to the contractor. “Financial transactions between UPRNN and the contractor will unravel several things, which will help us corroborate our findings from materials collected during raids,” said the official.
  
  The department is also scanning the financial details of the news channel to find a quid pro quo arrangement between Sharma and the contractor.
  
  I-T has also issued notices to registrar’s office in Dehradun and other places to look into properties owned by the two suspects and their family members in the past six years.
  
  “Land ownership and mutation records are crucial to the investigation, which will help us establish exact chronology of assets made and also income sources’ links of all the individuals,” said the official.
