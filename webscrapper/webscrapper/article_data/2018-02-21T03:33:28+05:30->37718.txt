NAVI MUMBAI: The civic chief faced some resistance from   corporator   while presenting the   budget. 

 Gurkhe insisted that the budget presentation is the sole right of the NMMC standing committee. Also, the commissioner cannot make budgetary information public until the next meeting of the standing committee which is likely to discuss the fund allocations. 
 
  N, however maintained that the right to presentthe budget by the civic chief has been bestowed by the Municipal Corporation Act and the budget has outlined estimates not actual amounts. 
 
 Sena corporator Dwarkanath Bhoir also counter-questioned the need for secrecy on p-resenting the budget. "The commissioner, for nearly two decades, has been presenting the estimated budget which is discussed by the civic standing committee which then sanctions it. Considering it (the budget) is merely appropriate allocation and accounting of the tax payer's money where is the need for maintaining so much secrecy," said Bhoir. 
 
 Standing committee chairman Shubhangi Patil said that the issue has been resolved and called a committee meeting next month to discuss the budget.
