 The Dalit families arrived at Rajheda bridge on the Ramganga, led by one Kamlesh Devi. They then immersed pictures and calendar art depicting Hindu deities in the river while chanting slogans protesting alleged atrocities on Dalits in western UP.

 “Since the Yogi government came to power, Dalits are being targeted throughout the state. Even under the   government, we were not terrified to such extant what we are today. During the BSP government in the state, law and order situation was up to the mark but now there is no rein on increasing crime and persecution of Dalits,” alleged Devi. 
 
 Asked about what religion they would follow from now on, Devi said, “We haven’t decided what faith we will embrace. We are waiting for a decision by our president, Lalla Babu. We will follow his decision.”
