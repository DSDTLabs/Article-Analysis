PUNE: The   has ordered all universities across the country to upload the research topic of every post-doctoral scholar on their websites to stop duplication. 

  (SPPU) will declare the topics of its research scholars in a month. So far, there was lack of a collective database of research undertaken by scholars which often resulted in repetition. 
 
 The commission, in its 521st meeting on February 22, decided to inform the universities to upload the data on specific parameters including name, department, mode of degree, research topic, likely date of completion and the funding agency, among others.
 
 It was also decided that University Grants Commission should maintain a defaulters’ list on its website if universities failed to upload the data.
 
 SPPU has over 800 affiliated colleges from Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik, making it the second-largest university system in the country. There are nearly 50 on-campus   under 11 faculties.
 
 Close to 1,000 candidates register for PhD and around 400 for MPhil degrees every year. Of these, about 70 to 80 special candidates apply for the respective degrees at the university annually.
 
 The university had initiated a research portal to track the status of the theses of scholars in 2015. Over 350 students secure doctorates every year from the university. 
 
 Registrar   said, “There are many faculty members in different departments of the university who are conducting research at their own levels. But many do not know the topics the others are working on. A summary of such work will also be put up on the portal. The system has been working well with the university, so far.”
 
 There is always a chance for duplication of topics which can be eliminated by uploading the information, he added.
