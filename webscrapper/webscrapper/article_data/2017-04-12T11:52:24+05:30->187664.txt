BHUBANESWAR: As riot-hit Bhadrak turned calm, chief minister   on Wednesday flew to the trouble-torn district headquarters town and met the victims affected by violence. 

 Sources said the chief minister asked the Bhadrak district collector to identify the genuine victims and dole out compensations for repair of their burnt houses and shops. 
 
 Many believe the CM's tour was part of a damage control exercise after allegations trickled in from different quarters that the communal violence was engineered by some local  . On Wednesday the administration relaxed curfew from 7am to 4pm.
