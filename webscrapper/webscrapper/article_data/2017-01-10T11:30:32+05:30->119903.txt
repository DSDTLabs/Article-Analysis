PANAJI: Suspense prevails in chief minister, Laxmikant Parsekarâ€™s Mandrem constituency and he can breathe easy for now, as his arch rivals,   are yet to name their candidate to challenge him in the epic battle.

 The Congress is spoilt for choice. On its list of possible candidates are former BJP Pernem MLA Dayanand Sopte, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Babi Bagkar, Congress youth leader and son of former education minister Sangita Parab, Sachin Parab, and former Congress MLA, Jitendra Deshprabhu. Former MLA from this constituency and former Union minister of state for law and judiciary, Ramakant Khalap, is also being considered as a nominee, sources said.
 
 The Congress leaders indecision over the choice of candidate has, however, thrown its party workers in a quandary and sources said the situation is reminiscent of 2007 and 2012 when various factions within the party had worked at cross purposes over the candidate choice. Such ambiguity results in disunity, sources added.
 
 New entrant, the  , has declared Devendra Prabhudessai, a supporter of the Mopa airport project, as its candidate, while the MGP is yet to declare its candidate. GSM has also expressed interest in the Madrem seat. Prabhudessai and his supporters have started their campaign with door-to-door visits and corner meetings. Deshprabhu too, has already hosted a few corner meetings in the villages of Mandrem.
 
 But, sources said the BJP has had a head start with the party hosting its   rally in Mandrem recently, which was a large crowd turnout. Sources said that BJP consider Sopte, who had switched to the Congress in 2012 and contested unsuccessfully against Parsekar, as their main rival this time and their strategy is to tackle him. BJP, sources added, also see an advantage in rejected Congress aspirants turning traitors against their own party with the possibility of one or two of them contesting as independents.
