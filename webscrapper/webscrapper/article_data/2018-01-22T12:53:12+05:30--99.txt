The 90s kids have grown up on a staple diet of fairytales from strange foreign shores. Closer to home, our grandparents regaled us with fascinating stories of war fought by God-men on golden chariots and horses. 

 
 There were no entertainment channels such as  , Pogo or Nickelodeon. We relied on books by   like the Famous Five, Nancy Drew and her investigations kept us hooked, and Tinkle comics made us laugh and cry while we enjoyed Karadi Tales cassettes. We took pleasure in slowly devouring hard-bound, beautifully illustrated, rich hand-painted drawings of our favourite Disney princesses, villains and their prince-charmings. 
 
 
 When my grandfather invested in a VCR, the siblings and I went ape-shit crazy (for the lack of a better term). Our trips to the VCR tape lending shop were maniacal, to say the least. While they rented the latest   action movies, I kept bringing home  's animated "Beauty and the Beast" movie. 
 
 
 I didn't know it then, but the 25-30 odd times I watched it, the subconscious message I was imbibing from it was—marry a very bad boy, the worse the better! Needless to say, my teen years were gripping. My parents were exasperated! However, I don't blame those wonderful cartoons for my foolish hormone-crazed actions. Those were all on me. 
 
 
 Each fairy tale has a hidden moral, which you can discover only if you read carefully and have the patience to peel off the layers.  's midnight curfew, tells children to be home on time or turn into a pumpkin. Snow White's shiny-red apple, conveys the message of never talking to or accepting food from strangers. Aladdin teaches children to never lie or hide your identity, people must love you for who you are. 
 
 
  are immortal. You're never too old to re-read or re-watch one. The solutions to most of our ‘adult problems’ lie in fairy tales. All we have to do is believe.
