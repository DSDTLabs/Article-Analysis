CHANDIGARH: A day after a drunken Class XII student punched a woman teacher on the nose on being asked to go to his class, a spokesperson for all government school teachers said here on Friday that they would be going on a “chalk down” strike on Saturday.

 The announcement came even as a committee of the   visited the school where the incident took place, and asked teachers and the principal there about the student and his past. A chalk-down strike means that though the teachers would attend school, they would not teach.
 
 Bhag Singh Kairon, who is heading the teachers’ committee, said all teachers working in government schools would participate in Saturday’s protest for demanding a policy for their security in schools. “There is strong resentment among us. We have asked the education department who is responsible for our safety. Teachers are not the enemies of students. We are here to guide them. Such incidents shatter our community. In such a situation, teachers will not perform their duties in the way they should do,”   said.
 
 They also met the director school education separately demanding strict action.
 
 UT district education officer (DEO)   said principals of other government schools were a part of the education department’s committee that gathered information about the student from other teachers. “We have found the student was a repeat offender and had previous complaints against him. We have apologies written by him and his parents for earlier instances,” the DEO said.
 
 Kairon said if the administration would not make a policy for the safety of teachers, they would be compelled to call a general body meeting of teachers next week to take next decision.
