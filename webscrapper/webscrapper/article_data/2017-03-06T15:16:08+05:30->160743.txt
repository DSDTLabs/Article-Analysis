 has been playing   since seventeen years and without a doubt it’s the most popular and loved character from the X-Men series.
 
  But during an appearance on The Late Show with  , which airs on   Premiere HD in India, Hugh Jackman revealed that his son Oscar, 16, thinks he's nothing like the film's leading character.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  'I remember my son having a friend come over. He was about 13 [at the time],' Hugh recalled. 'The guy was peppering him with Wolverine questions and my son was like, nothing,' referring to Oscar keeping completely quiet.
  
  'Finally I hear this, "Listen, Dad is nothing like Wolverine. He's not tough, he's not cool. Don't ask me anything about it",' the Sydney-born actor continued in good humour.
  
  Hugh currently stars in Logan, the latest of the Wolverine spin-off series, but will be the last in which Hugh plays the popular character. His role required many shirtless scenes and a dedicated three-month diet and fitness regime, in the lead-up to filming. He admitted that he is enjoying returning to a normal eating plan.
  
  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed. With it still in my lap,” he added.
  
  The Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs on Star World Premiere HD every Monday to Friday at 8:00 PM.
