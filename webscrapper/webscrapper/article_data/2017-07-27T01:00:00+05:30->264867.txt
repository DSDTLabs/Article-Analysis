There is a rumour in K-Town that   is planning to act, direct and produce an action film under the title   3. Some sources, however, tell us that this will not be a sequel to Ajith’s Billa reboots. There is also speculation that STR has redone the script of his  , which he had announced way back in 2008, and it is this script that he is planning to make as Billa 3.

 A source tells us that Simbu has written the antagonist character as a very powerful, psychotic and ruthless one on the lines of Heath Ledger’s Joker from The Dark Knight. The plot involves two protagonists, one of which will be played by Simbu, and the other the female lead character, going after this criminal, and the deadly cat-and-mouse game between them.
 
 We hear that STR has shot some footage in the city recently as a test shoot, which he also hopes to release as a teaser trailer, to whip up the frenzy among his fans, especially after the debacle of his recent release Anbanavan Asarathavan Adangathavan. The actor is planning to shoot the film in the US, and will be going there next month to scout locations for the film.
 
 The buzz is that actor has been looking for a stylish actress to play the female lead, and has now roped in Arrambam girl   to shoot a teaser this Friday. Meanwhile, he has roped in entrepreneur Sam Paul, who was seen as a corrupt cop in Vanamagan, for a negative role. 
 
 However, sources close to Simbu are tight-lipped about the development and maintain that these are rumours. But they admitted to us that the actor is indeed working on a film, and had done a test shoot, but said that he has been keeping the details about this project close to his heart.
