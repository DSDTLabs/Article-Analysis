JAIPUR: The long march by country’s farmers, from   to New Delhi, demanding loan waiver and fair price for their produce, reached Jaipur on Saturday.

 The march wound its way here from Maharashtra and will pass through parts of UP and Haryana before arriving in Delhi on July 18.
 
 At a meeting held at CPM office in the morning, Maharashtra MP Raju Shetti, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan, farmers’ leader V M Singh, Dr Sunilam, Rajasthan’s Amra Ram and leaders from Tamil Nadu participated and expressed their solidarity with farmers.
 
 Yadav said that the media was often puzzled by protesting jeans-clad farmers. What it fails to see is that various groups such as the Adivasis, women, Dalits and landless workers were coming together in the new emerging farmers’ movement, he said.
 
 A two-minute silence was observed for six farmers who were killed in the police firing in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, on June 6.
 
 “Farmers feed the nation, but this is a nation ungrateful to the people who feed her. We now have to grab our rights from people who govern us. And although we are shown all these images of progress—of vikas—we know that there are no jobs out there. What will our children do once they complete studying? We have incurred loans for their education. If there is no farming, they will sink into depression and become dependent on drugs,” V M Singh said.
 
 Shetti, who led the protest in Maharashtra, spoke of how the movement had forced the Maharashtra state government to waive loans. On the eve of the ultimatum set by farmers, the state government announced on June 11 that it would waive loans of small farmers.
 
 “If Maharashtra can announce a Rs 34,000 crore loan waiver, other states too should give similar waivers,” Shetti said.
 
 Yogendra Yadav alleged that the loans had become a burden due to government policy. “This government at the Centre is the worst for farmers in the history of independent India,” he said.
