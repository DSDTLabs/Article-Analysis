Panaji: Every day, children from 400 schools across the state generate around two tonnes (2,000kg) of biodegrabadble waste which is collected by the state, CM Manohar Parrikar said on Sunday, even as he took a dig at those criticizing PM Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  “Students are being encouraged to bring plastic and similar biodegradable waste from their houses to schools, from where we collect it over a period of 15 days in cycles. We are collecting almost 1.5 to 2 tonnes of plastic and similar type of waste from schools nearly every day,” he said, while speaking at the inauguration of a waste collection centre at the secretariat in Porvorim. Seventy-five percent of the facility has been built using recycled materials. Reiterating the government’s aim of making Goa garbage-free by 2020, Parrikar said small garbage treatment plants will be set up at village and municipality levels to achieve the target. The plants will be able to generate biogas from about 5 kilos of waste, doing away with the need to travel to Saligao to dispose garbage. “The plant at Saligao was constructed to handle garbage generated along the coastal belt and in the city of Bardez, including Mapusa,” Parrikar said. He also said that the state will start a mobile garbage collection facility and utilise old KTC buses for the purpose. “We will achieve our target of garbage-free Goa by 2020. There are three ways to go about it — we can stress on reduction of unnecessary waste created out of unnecessary consumption, or try to work out local solution in case waste generation is inevitable or manage waste at its own level,” the CM said.
