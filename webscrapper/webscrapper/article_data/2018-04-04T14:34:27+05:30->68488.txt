NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Tuesday, asked   (MCI) to give an undertaking on its stand on Indira Gandhi Government Medical College’s (IGGMC) 150 MBBS seats.

 A division bench comprising justices   and   while adjourning the hearing till Wednesday warned the apex body for medical education of contempt action, in case of failure.
 
 Last Wednesday, the HC had warned MCI of any reduction of seats and asked it to file comprehensive affidavit on its recommendations to the centre to reduce the seats.
 
 The directives came while hearing writ petition (No 3427/2000) filed by CH Sharma and others, regarding lack of facilities in government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCHs) across Vidarbha. The MCI’s move was brought to the HC’s notice by amicus curiae Anup Gilda, who submitted its communication of February 28 to the union health and family welfare ministry’s secretary.
 
 The MCI’s letter stated that its executive committee considered assessment report of December 19 last year and February 1 and 2 this year, where it found some deficiencies in the IGGMC. “The executive committee decided to recommend to centre not to approve IGGMC for award of MBBS degree by MUHS, Nasik, against the increased intake from 100 to 150 seats. It was further decided to call upon the concerned college to submit compliance of listed deficiencies within a month. The decision of the executive committee was approved by our oversight committee on February 23,” the letter mentioned.
