On Monday, thousands of students gathered at Arts Faculty, DU, not for a protest - which is the usual sight at the location - but to see actor Akshay Kumar flag off a unique women's marathon. The marathon, organised by DUSU General Secretary Mahamedhaa Nagar, was to promote tax-free sanitary napkins, and the reel-life Padman came to share his support, and said that he hoped that napkins will in fact be made completely free, especially for women living in rural areas.

The moment he arrived on the stage, he clicked selfies and shook hands with the students. The actor then thanked the crowd. "I have never seen a crowd like this. Thank you for this love and affection, main pehle bhi aaya hoon Delhi University. Kamaal ki university hai aapki," he said. The actor then called a girl from the crowd on the stage who was elated to meet him. "Sir, my name is Gargi and I am a second-year student in this university," she told Akshay. When the actor asked her about 'Padman', she replied, "This is a story about a man who wants to help his wife. Menstruation may have been a taboo in our society till now but things have changed." 
	
	
	
	
	
	 











  Akshay added, "It is not a disease, it is a natural thing. This is a run for tax -free pads but in my opinion they should be made completely free, especially in the rural areas."  Before the actor could finish, someone from the crowd started touching his pants. The actor paused and said, "Abbey rukh jaa, meri pant khichega kya, ruk ja." Akshay also unveiled a sanitary pad machine at the event.
