NAGPUR: NMC has charged Vansh Nimay Infraprojects Ltd, the private firm appointed by it to operate city bus service, of   dues. To recover the money, NMC has decided to go for arbitration, which the operator has also demanded, said an official from  . 

 “The huge dues are a major reason of ending agreement with  , even though it is expiring on February 28, 2017,” he said. “In spite of sufficient opportunities and time given to VNIL, it failed to mend its ways, services, as well as failed to discharge the financial liability,” he said. 
 
 The termination notice given to VNIL charged that the company had also not paid taxes due to the government. As per motor vehicles rules, VNIL was to deposit 3.5% of total revenue as passenger tax and children nutrition fund with RTO. VNIL has not rendered the accounts so total revenue could be ascertained, nor submitted the receipts of having paid taxes, the notice stated.
 
 Against 470 buses that VNIL had agreed to ply on city roads, not even half that number actually plied. Nearly 190 road permits were secured from RTO to enable these buses to ply but many of these routes were not serviced at all causing inconvenience to the public, the notice claimed. 
 
 Though VNIL officials were not available for comments, official sources said there is no question arises to clear the dues. The NMC has not paid the students’ concessions, which too runs into over Rs 100 crores. Besides this, it had also failed to provide parking facilities which ruined the city bus maintenance and subsequently affected plying of number of city buses, said the sources. Moreover, VNIL too has demanded arbitration over the pending dues, sources added.
