BENGALURU: While four days are left for the ban on   to come into force, only 15 two-stroke   have sought cancellation of   (RCs) so far. The city has nearly 20,000 two-stroke autorickshaws.

 As per procedure, drivers have to submit registration certificates cancellation letters along with their twostroke autos to the government-authorized scrap centre. Once the centre issues a scrap certificate, the government will transfer Rs 30,000 subsidy to the driver’s bank account to buy a new fourstroke auto or electric auto.
 
 Transport department records show only 5 of the 15 two-stroke autos have been scrapped so far. “We have requested the government to extend the deadline on twostroke autos. But we are yet to receive any communication from them,” said a senior transport department official.
 
 In the 2017-18 budget, the government allocated Rs 30 crore to provide Rs 30,000 subsidy to owners of two-stroke autos to switch to four-stroke LPG ones. The aim was to curb air and sound pollution by phasing out two-stroke autos. However, auto drivers felt the subsidy is inadequate to buy a new vehicle that costs nearly Rs 1.7 lakh.
 
 Transport department officials said they have written three letters to the finance department to increase the subsidy amount from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000. But there has been no response from the finance department.
 
 Many two-stroke drivers complain that nationalized banks which give vehicle loans at an interest of 8%- 10% are insisting on an undertaking from the transport department. However, the department maintains they cannot issue authorization certificates to banks on behalf of drivers. This is forcing two-stroke auto drivers to depend on private financiers who are offering loan at 8%- 15% interest.
 
 C Sampath, general secretary of Adarsh Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union, said: “The government should increase the subsidy amount and also simplify the process to get it.”
