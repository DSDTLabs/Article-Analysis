Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) animal shelter, which has been facing several controversies, will now be managed by the civic body and not any private organization. NMC has appointed three full-time veterinary doctors on contractual basis at the shelter. On Thursday, NMC standing committee chairman Vicky Kukreja visited the shelter and reportedly assured to provide Rs8.6 crore for the proposed master plan. After completing some formalities, the plan will be put up before the standing committee for approval.  The shelter was earlier managed by the People for Animal Welfare Organisation on voluntarily basis. In August 2015, TOI was the first to report that NMC had invited expression of interest (EOI) from non-government organizations for managing its temporary animal shelter, which had always been mired in controversy due to its pathetic conditions, leading to animals deaths. Following this, two city-based animal welfare organizations, had in February 2016 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for running the shelter. Later, the MOU was scrapped following protests by animal activists who were infuriated by the shelter’s pitiful conditions. Activists are now hopeful that the conditions of the shelter will improve. “Till now, it was neglected due to lack of funds. With NMC agreeing to shell out funds, many facilities can be improved,” said Karishma Galani of People for Animal Welfare Organisation.
