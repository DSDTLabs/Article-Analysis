HYDERABAD: The Institute of Preventive Medicine ( ) that until recently conducted all   tests for free, is now levying a hefty charge of Rs 3,500 per test. Reason: to curb the practice of prescribing tests unnecessarily, among private hospitals, in order to `squeeze money' from patients. In fact, authorities allege that swine flu tests have turned into a money-spinning method adopted by many corporate hospitals.

 “Till two months ago, the tests were being conducted free of cost for all. But then we came to know that hospitals were charging Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000 from patients for the tests,“ said a senior official of the state health department pointing out how each kit costs lakhs of rupees to the state that, despite the financial burden, was extending the service for free. “The hospitals, however, turned it into an excuse to charge an added amount from patients. In fact, private hospitals continue to squeeze as much money as they can from patients and then send them to state-run hospitals at the end stage,“ the official added.
 
 He said that IPM will revert to conducting the tests for free only if hospitals commit to not charging patients for the tests.
 
 At present, apart from extracting the tests' amount from patients hospitals have also been resorting to prescribing repeat tests to further jack up the bills. “Apart from marking up the charges, many have been repeating samples of the same patient,“ revealed, Dr K Shivaleela, director IPM.
 
 In the process of meeting these marked up prices patient's families' end up losing both their property and money like in the case of the 18 month-old girl suspected of having swine flu, who died without undergoing the   despite the family spending Rs 4 lakh for treatment at a private hospital.
