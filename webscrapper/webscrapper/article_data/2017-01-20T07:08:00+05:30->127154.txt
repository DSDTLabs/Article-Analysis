CHARMINAR:   ( ) chairman Abid Rasool Khan on Thursday said that he has moved   against the Telangana government to seek directions which would allow the minorities panel to function unhindered till it is bifurcated.

 The State Minorities Commission serves both state of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and is a Schedule X entity which is yet to be bifurcated. As was earlier reported in these columns, the commission had received a notice from the office of the estate officer threatening it with eviction from Ragahava Sadan, from where it functions. 
 
 On Thursday, three officials of the commission moved out to another location while chairman Abid Rasool Khan and a few other employees refused to budge.
 
 “In the petition we have prayed for the following: payment of salaries from May 2016 to December 2016. That the commission be allowed to function till it is bifurcated. We have also petitioned that the government provide all necessary amenities for the smooth functioning of the commission. While some officials have vacated the premises, we will not leave the premises till the matter comes up in court,” Khan said. The case will be heard on Janury 25, the commission chairman added. “It is not right to handover the entire files to just one state,” he explained.
