CHANDIGARH: City traders have raised a demand for provision of storage space in the booths and bay shops. They also want to be given permission for alterations in existing shop-cum-flats\shop-cum-offices. 

  (CBM) has submitted a representation to the Administrator's Advisory Standing Committee on Urban Planning and Heritage Preservation. The meeting of the committee was held on Thursday.
 
 The traders stated that to be able to make profitable business, they had to store all varieties of products.  , chairman of CBM building by-laws committee, stated that there is paucity of space in the booth and bay shops to store different items. Therefore, Chandigarh administration may provide additional storage space by allowing basement to full size of plot, which will be subject to ensuring safety of adjoining buildings or construction of first floor, having stairs from inside. The provision has already been allowed in Panchkula by   government. Double storey-booths or bay shops are allowed in   while the height of the samein other parts of the city is restricted to single storey.
 
 Joshi also took the issue of allowing construction of box-type structures in the first phase of the city. Owners of SCOs/SCFs have been demanding the same since the past 15 years. He urged that the commercial establishments in the first phase should be allowed to construct box-type structure on pattern of SCO's\SCF's in the Phase II of the city.
 
 "In the interest of traders, the box type construction of SCFs/SCOs of Phase-I Sectors 7 to 30 may be allowed," said Joshi.
