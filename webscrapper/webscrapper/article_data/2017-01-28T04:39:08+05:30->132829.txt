Navi Mumbai: Despite concern and awareness for stray animals, incidences of animals disappearing continue to haunt animal lovers in Navi Mumbai. 

 The most recent case involves a resident of Adaigaon, Vaishali Damle, from   who returned home after a 10-day work assignment to find the female   of her society missing. 
 
 Damle, said that the stray used to reside in her society. “The dog had delivered six pups a month ago of which two died. The surviving four and the lactating mother were being looked after by me.” 
 
 Other residents objected to her feeding the pups and told her to get rid of the animals. Apart from the missing stray, the pups have also disappeared on Wednesday night and none have been traced so far.
