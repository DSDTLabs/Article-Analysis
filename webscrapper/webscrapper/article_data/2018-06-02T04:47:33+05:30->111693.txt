MUMBAI: Third-year engineering (information technology) students who appeared for   on Wednesday were stumped to see that almost 30% of the questions were from the  . While the chairman of the subject has suggested giving 20 marks as grace to students,   is yet to take a final decision. 

 The university’s engineering faculty has been plagued with problems related to the quality of paper-setting for some time now. Last week, repeaters from the civil engineering branch complained that their question paper was almost identical to the exam they had taken in December last year as regular students. It has now come to light that the   on May 22 was almost identical to previous year’s paper. In fact, papers were almost repeated for at least three consecutive exams. Nanotechnology is offered by limited number of colleges, but there are a lot of questions that students can be tested on, said a final-year student. He added that the question paper was almost repeated in May 2016, May 2017, December 2017 and May 2018.
 
 
  
 
 
 A college principal said their teachers were unofficially told by MU officials to give 20 marks as grace to the IT students for the out-of-syllabus questions. “...There’s no official communication on the same,” said the principal. The question paper on data mining and business intelligence was set for 100 marks, instead of 80 marks. “The university needs to take strict action against teachers responsible for such goof-ups which are becoming common” said another principal. 
 
 The dean of technology, Suresh Ukrande, said the complaints on IT question paper and the repetition of nanotechnology papers have not been given to him, but gave an assurance that he would look into them. Vinod Malale, MU exam section spokesperson, said there’s a recom-mendation to give  , but a final decision is pending.
