NASHIK: Centre's decision to start   has come as a ray of hope for hundreds of onion farmers of   district in fetching them the right prices for selling the commodity.

 The   Minister,  , while presenting the Budget on Thursday announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in potato, tomato and onion for benefit of farmers and consumers. He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.
 
 'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting   (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.
 
 The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.
 
 The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.
 
 According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.
 
 But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.
 
 Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.
 
 A major onion grower of the district   said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility.
