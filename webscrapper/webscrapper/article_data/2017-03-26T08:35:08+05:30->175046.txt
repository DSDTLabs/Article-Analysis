MUMBAI: Buoyed by the March 24 order of the   of India, issuing clarity on the tenure of office bearers and administrators in Indian cricket, the   is calling for a   (SGM) on April 9 in New Delhi.

 “It's a tentative date for now, but it's the most likely date,” a senior BCCI office bearer, whose tenure is very much active following the SC clarification, told TOI.
 
 The BCCI old guard had been at “wit's end” post the Vinod Rai-led Committee of Administrators' ( ) “adamant stand“ about the tenure being restricted only to nine years.
 
 “It's nine years, and that's final. There's absolutely no confusion about it,” Rai had told journalists in New Delhi earlier this week.
 
 However, on Friday, the SC read out its own order, saying it was “as clear as the cloudless blue sky,” underlining once again that the tenure was not capped at nine years but at nine-plus-nine years.
 
 The BCCI associations re quire either a quorum of 10 members to call for a SGM or the president of the BCCI can ask the secretary to set the agenda and call for it.
 
 The members are working on how to go about with it, knowing that the SC has also issued a clarification on the constitution that's in place right now.
 
 The state associations are of the view that the CoA shouldn't have taken such an obstructive view of things and worked inclusively. “Instead, they began writing nasty letters reminding us how we did not belong. Only when they realised that hosting of IPL matches could be an issue, they wrote to us. All of this could've been avoided if their approach was collaborative. But there, now you have the SC reminding them about their remit,” he added.
 
 It is not confirmed yet if former BCCI president N Srinivasan will attend the meeting. However another official, in the know of things, said, ahead of the SGM, members could call for another unofficial meeting anytime soon to sit and understand the SC order and take a call on how to proceed.
