BHOPAL: On the occasion of Dussehra, tribals in Betul district are up in arms against the tradition of the burning of Ravana effigy, claiming Ravana and his son   to be their deity. They have opposed the effigy burning and submitted memorandums to district officials in this regard.

 In the memorandum, the tribals have said, “We have been worshipping Meghnad for centuries. Ravan is a Mahapurush and he is not only our king but also our ancestor. During Holi every year, we worship Meghnad. In such a case, burning Ravana as a symbol of victory of good over evil is culturally and constitutionally wrong.”
 
 “Article 25 of the Constitution provides for religious freedom to all communities. The Constitution provides freedom to followers of all religions, but it also says that it is important to respect the feelings of the followers of other religions”, it reads further.
 
 The memorandum also stated that not only does the burning of Ravana’s effigy hurt the sentiments of the tribal community, it also has adverse effects on the environment. They added that such an act would also be anti-national.
 
 Tribal community members have threatened to register FIRs against the organisers and samiti members, if effigies are burned.
 
 “So far we have not received any information from the administration but we are considering registering FIRs if effigies are burned,”  , a tribal, told TOI.
