 “Our contention on behalf of GCMMF was that the VMC had allotted the space for parlours for a period of five years commencing from 2016 for which GCMMF had already paid deposit and annual permit fees of 2016 and 2017 in advance,” said advocate Kunal Vyas, who along with Nandish Chudgar appeared on behalf of GCMMF in the court of justice Anand Chhaya. “Without issuance of notice, four parlours were demolished which has been challenged in the court. The court has asked both the parties to maintain status quo which amounts to granting of stay over demolition and asked VMC to file its reply by the next date of hearing which is April 24,” said Vyas, adding that photographs showing VMC’s demolition drive have also been submitted in the court.
