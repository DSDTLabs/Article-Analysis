CHENNAI: After moving the   and participating in a hunger strike, party working president M K Stalin will meet   in New Delhi on Thursday and present his version of the incidents that took place in the   during the floor test on February 18.

 "Our leader will reach New Delhi on Thursday morning as he has an appointment with the President in the evening. We are also trying to get an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but we are yet to get it," said a senior DMK leader, seeking anonymity.
 
 In a bid to make the state-wide one-day hunger strike organised by DMK in the state a 'people's protest', Stalin invited public, students and youth.
 DMK has been on the offensive against the   after it won the trust vote, referring to it as a 'benami' government. Party MLAs have been uploading videos with speeches on social media, targeting the ruling party.
 
 "This state government must go. Tamil Nadu does not want the family of a person who has been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison to lead the government or party. If this government continues, no company will be interested in investing in our state," said the DMK leader.
 
 After meeting the President, the party will announce street meeting in all districts. "All our party leaders, MLAs, MPs and former ministers will speak at these meetings, asking people to throw out the present government," he said.
