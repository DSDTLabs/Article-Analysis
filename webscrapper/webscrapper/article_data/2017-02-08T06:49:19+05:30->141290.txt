JAIPUR:   on Tuesday accused former mayor   of corruption and claimed that the state government sought his resignation after   

 Khandelwal alleged that former   along with his official on special duty (OSD) Jagish Garg was promoting corruption at the JMC. She alleged Garg’s kin has registered three firms and tenders were given to them. Also, the duo was generating salaries of many temporary and permanent employees after presenting the fake records. 
 
 “Many employees remained on papers and were not deployed on ground. The BJP government has just done a formality and no action has been taken against the corrupt mayor. I will register a complaint against the   at Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) office and file an PIL at the high court,” she said.
 
 She further alleged that the BJP government continued to promote corruption at JMC and violated service rules as Garg is still holding the post of OSD of new mayor. “As per the state government directions, it’s mandatory for an employee to retire after the age of 62. Garg is holding a post of OSD at the age of 78. He is shielded by BJP state president Ashok Parnamai as he was OSD since his tenure,” she alleged 
 
 On December 13, former mayor Nirmal Nahata, resigned from his post. It was claimed that Nahata resigned due to personal reasons. “The resignation was asked after PMO sought an answer from the party. The BJP government should have taken action against it’s corrupt mayor. This board is shielding corruption as no action was taken against the chairmen of sanitation committees after the audio tape had gone viral,” added Khandelwal
