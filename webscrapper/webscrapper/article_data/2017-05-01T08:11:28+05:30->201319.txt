LUCKNOW: Treating children with   is often a bigger test for resident doctors in   at  , the toughest part being snatching the kids’ favourite plaything, the  . 

 “Everyday, our team has to break many hearts as they snatch the teddy bears from kids as the stuffed toy is one of the biggest triggers of  ,” said Dr Suryakant Tripathi, head of pulmonary department, KGMU. “All stuffed toys, loaded with fibres trigger wheezing and it is hard to make children part with them,” he added. 
 
 “Soft toys are home to dust mites which are known to cause asthma. They can’t be removed even if they are cleaned regularly,” said Dr B P Singh, pulmonary critical care expert in the city who is asthmatic too. 
 
 About 40% of the 3 crore asthmatics in India are children below 14 years, according to World Health Organisation data released in 2016. Estimates from KGMU and other Indian hospitals suggests that 71% children with asthma are below five years of age at the time of first attack. 
 
 Dr Singh said he takes help of asthma care givers (nurse/para medical staff trained to guide parents deal with lifestyle changes needed to beat asthma attacks). “Children cry like they do on the first day of school and some refuse to take medicines and food some helping them cope with the situation is an important part of our counselling,” said Lavlesh Kumar, an asthma care giver at Dr Singh’s hospital. Lavlesh uses the blame strategy to achieve the target. “To a 4-6-year-old, we say the pain caused to them or the hospitalisation is because of the teddy/stuff toy which is a ‘bad child’, while children who are older are told about the harms caused by the toy,” he said.
 
 Retired consultant psychiatrist, Dr Harjeet Singh said, “Toys are precious to kids and part of their fondest memories when they grow up so, it is important to make help them give up a toy willingly instead of snatching it away. Only effective communication works,” he explained.
