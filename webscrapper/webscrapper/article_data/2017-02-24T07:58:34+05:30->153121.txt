LUCKNOW: The fourth phase of assembly elections UP held on Thursday across 53 constituencies in 12 districts registered 60.75% turnout-a marginal increase as compared to 61.16% in 2012, but lowest as compared to the first three phase that recorded 64%, 66% and 61.16% polling, respectively. 

 The round also witnessed first major incident of poll violence in the elections held so far, when the son of SP's Mahoba candidate was injured when allegedly shot at by supporters of the BSP candidate. Two people were arrested after the incident. Stray incidents of clashes and stone pelting boycott were also reported from some parts. Additional police force was deployed in Atkhariya village falling under Meja assembly constituency after BJP workers indulged in stone-pelting accusing a cop of influence voters, said officials. 
 
 In Lalitpur, voters of four villages-Bamrana, Gaganpur, Barchun and Parol-abstained from polling protesting lack of development in their area. Chief electoral officer (UP), T Venkatesh confirmed that not a single vote was cast in the four villages by 5pm, till last reports came in.
 
 Areas which went to poll on Thursday included drought-prone and dacoit-infested backward region of Bundelkhand and parts of Central UP including Gandhi bastion Rae Bareli and East UP. All constituencies which went to polls on Thursday have substantial Dalit and OBC population. For the first time since 1998, Sonia Gandhi gave campaigning a miss in her constituency.
 
 Pollsters said increase in polling in comparison to previous election shows more awareness among voters but at the same time decline as compared to earlier phases indicates absence of communal polarisation as Muslim population in this region is comparatively less than other parts of the state.
 
 The fourth phase was crucial for SP-Congress alliance because the two parties and independents supported by them had won 36 assembly seats in 2012 elections and by-polls held thereafter. Lalitpur recorded highest polling at 71.44%, which was lower than 72.67% recorded in 2012 assembly polls and 73.97% reported in 2014 elections.
 
 Poll percentage soared in Banda from 56.87% in 2012 to 59.22% this time, also higher than 52.53% recorded in 2014. Mahoba saw a rise from 61.98% in 2012 to 64.95%.
 
 In Jhansi, voting percentage went up from 63.76% into 2012 to 65.60%. In Rae Bareli, polling percentage rose to 60.33% from 60.21% in 2012. Pratapgarh saw 54.72% turnout, up from 53.8% in 2012. Allahabad, however, registered a drop from 55.08% in 2012 to 54.48%.
