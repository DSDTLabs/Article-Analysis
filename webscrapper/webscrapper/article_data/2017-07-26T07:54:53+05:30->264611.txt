BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Poetry Festival (BPF) is back with fresh, young and more feminine voices. The second edition, slated to be held on August 5 and 6 at the Leela Palace hotel, promises a huge line-up of young poets, thinkers and performers for the city's poetry enthusiasts. Entry is free. 

 The inaugural session will see auteur, lyricist and poet   talk about his latest poetry collection, Suspected Poems. The event will be moderated by bureaucrat and Rajya Sabha MP Pavan K Varma who translated the book into English.
 
  "On August 6, we will have Gulzar and Pavan switching positions, with the former interviewing the parliamentarian about his book, Yudhishtar and Draupadi," said Subodh Shankar, co-organizer of the festival. 
 
  The festival will have eminent names like Chandrasekhar Kambar, Ashok Vajpeyi, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Ayaz Rasool Nazki,  , Jerry Pinto and   sharing the stage with young poets like Rohan Chettri, Medha Singh, and Rochelle D'Silva, among others. 
 
 "We didn't repeat names from last year's edition. There are more feminist and feminine voices this time around," said Shinie Antony, festival director. 
 
 Besides Hindi and English, regional language poetry also finds a space at the festival. The sessions, according to Shinie, will be "more performance-oriented with less discussions."
 
 "The feedback we received from the audience last year was that they wanted to see poets reading out their poetry instead of just discussing subjects," said co-organizer Lakshmi Subodh. Apart from poetry-reading and panel discussions, the festival will have workshops for adults and children. "There's also a poetry treasure hunt for the little ones," she added. 
 
 The evenings will end with musical performances. The first day will have Smitha Bellur and group conducting a mystic poetry performance on works by Bhakti poets; folk singer Mame Khan and group will perform on the concluding day.
