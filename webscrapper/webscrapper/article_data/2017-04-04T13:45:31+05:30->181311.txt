SHIMLA: Against 20.63 lakh hectares forest area targeted to be demarcated, 11.04 lakh hectares (54%) had not been demarcated even after the lapse of more than 28 years. Bringing the functioning of state forest department under scanner, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in its report, tabled in the   recently, has pointed out that there was encroachment of 9,545 hectares of forest land involving 43,086 cases in the state up to March 2016. 

 Report said that total of 15,409 cases of forest land encroachments involving 3,572 hectares were pending in revenue and forest courts as of March 2016. It said that fencing work of vacated forest areas could not be carried out and Rs 46.76 lakh towards cost of fencing was not recovered from encroachers in accordance with directions of the high court. 
 
 The forest department is responsible for forest management and conservation in the state. An audit of records relating to encroachment of forest land in   covering the period 2013-16 was conducted (May-June 2016) through test-check of the records of nodal officer-chief conservator of forest (forest protection and fire control) Bilaspur, chief conservator of forest (working plan and settlement), Mandi, and four forest divisions â€“ Anni, Chopal, Kullu and Rohru.
 
 Out of 35.91 lakh hectares of forest area owned by the forest department, 9,545 hectares of forest area valued at Rs 640 crore involving 43,086 cases was encroached upon up to March 2016. Of this, 3,921 hectares involving 18,854 cases valued at Rs 263 crore had been evicted by the department as of March 2016 whereas 5,624 hectares of forest area involving 24,232 cases valued at Rs 377 crore was still in the possession of encroachers.
 
 CAG during the audit observed that in 12 districts, only 9.59 lakh hectares area had been demarcated against 20.63 lakh hectares forest area targeted to be demarcated leaving 11.04 lakh hectares (54%) of forest area not demarcated even after lapse of more than 28 years.
 
 As per the instructions of May 2011 of the state government, a special task force was to be constituted to facilitate process of registration of FIRs and issuance of challans against persons who have encroached upon more than 10 bighas of forest land. The high court, however, ordered in February 2016 that FIRs should be registered in all cases of encroachments within eight weeks from the date of order. 
 
 Report said that departments had failed to vacate the encroachments/take over possession of the forest land as the eviction during 2013-16 ranged between 48% and 81%. Delay in obtaining eviction was due to lack of coordination between revenue and forest departments for demarcation/spot verification of encroached land, it said.
 
 Scrutiny of records in test-checked divisions showed that against eviction order passed in 2,178 cases involving an area of 1,053 hectares during the years 1994-2016, land was vacated from encroachers only in 810 cases involving an area of 334 hectares with delays ranging between one and 21 years. In the remaining 1,368 cases involving an area of 719 hectares, action was yet to be taken till June last year. Besides, 2,773 cases involving an area of 934 hectares encroached during the period 1994-2013 were lying pending for want of eviction orders in the concerned courts.
 
 The audit findings were referred to the government in August last year and reply had not been received till December 2016.
