NEW DELHI: After deploying   to make its areas  , the   is now trying to rope in a private agency to encourage scientific disposal of non-biodegradable waste.

 Currently, areas under SDMC’s jurisdiction generate about 150 MT of   waste daily, which is mixed with municipal solid waste due to lack of segregation. Officials said the civic body was working on a comprehensive “reduce, reuse, recycle” plan for management of plastic and  . A senior official told TOI: “We have floated a tender and will rope in a private agency for management of plastic and e-waste.”
 
 On zonal levels, units will be developed for recycling and scientifically disposing of plastic and e-waste. Ragpickers will be involved to segregate it from municipal solid waste. The private agency will collaborate with the private concessionaire engaged in collection and disposal of municipal solid waste to ensure non-biodegradable waste doesn’t reach landfills.
 
 This, the official said, would not only reduce the load on landfill sites but also promote scientific disposal of non-biodegradable waste.
 
 Currently, the non-biodegradable waste that is dumped at Okhla landfill site is processed at a waste-to-energy plant. Environmentalists claim that due to non-segregation, the idea of a WTE plant is defeated.
 
 “Non-biodegradable waste releases a lot of toxic chemicals when it’s mixed with municipal solid waste,” said the official.
 
 SDMC has deployed fixed compactors in its central zone and work has been initiated to make west and south zones dhalao-free. Also, the south civic body has developed 21 centres to treat green waste. “Gradually, we are trying to free the landfill site from other types of waste. As many as 21 centres have been developed to treat green waste and another 21 will be started for organic treatment of wet waste. Composting pits will be developed for vermi-composting of bio-degradable waste, which will be used as manures at parks,” said the official.
