PUNE: The police, in an advisory released for   in the city on Wednesday, has recommended a “buddy system” to ensure that no  , continuous monitoring of   and checking the emotional condition of staffers, including security guards. 

 The advisory, which is not legally binding, comes in the wake of the brutal murder of Infosys software engineer Rasila Raju OP on the company’s campus in Hinjewadi on January 29. A security guard has been arrested in connection with the murder.
 
 The police have prima facie found various lapses in the security measures adopted by the company, which include the fact that Rasila was working alone in the offshore development centre (ODC) room where she was murdered and non-monitoring of the CCTV footage. 
 
 Pune has more than 125 IT and IT-enabled service companies spread across the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park at Hinjewadi and the IT corridor at Kharadi off the Pune-Ahmednagar road, besides smaller IT parks at Talawade, Aundh and Wakad, among other areas.
 
 The advisory also suggests that no woman employee should be picked up first or dropped last in the cabs provided by the companies. It also advises a background check of the security guards at the companies.
 
 Joint commissioner of police Sunil Ramanand told TOI on Tuesday, “Security is of utmost importance at the IT companies. They will have to bear the responsibility of maintaining internal security. These companies must have a   for women, should monitor the pick up and drop facility, monitor the CCTV cameras, check on the emotional health of the employees and screen the guards to ensure they are mentally stable.”
 
 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe has written to police commissioner Rashmi Shukla that IT companies should be told to deploy women security guards to accompany female employees when they are picked up from and dropped to their residences.
