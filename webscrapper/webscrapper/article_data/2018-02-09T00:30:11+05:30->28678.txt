NAVI MUMBAI: The   Swachh   arrived in the city on Thursday morning. The team comprising four members from Delhi started the process by verifying documents that substantiated NMMC’s claims of the various ways used to keep the city clean. 

 “The team went through the documents that essentially detailed our efforts to keep the city clean. So if we have claimed of having installed RFID technology in the dustbins then there should be supporting documents,” said   commissioner Ramaswami N.
 
 Civic officials said they don’t have information about the next course of action to be taken by the team. “The survey process is very scientific and is conducted by the team independently. An app-based system is being used to determine places to be visited,” an official said. On Friday more members are expected to visit the city.
