NAGPUR: Vasantrao Naik Institute of Social Sciences and Arts ( ) reconsidered its decision to send nine teachers for a 42-day residential training to Pune after some faculty members and students expressed concerns.

 On Friday, the institute pulled out names of four teachers from the list for training that is starting from February 20.
 
 Some students said Psychology and Geography subjects have practicals and need teachers to be present in lab. The college had asked teachers to conduct practicals and internal assessment before leaving.
 
 Joint director of   department, Pune, Mohan Khatal said that training is essential but it is the college’s job to send teachers in batches so that academic activities are not disturbed.
 
 Morris college director   didn’t respond to TOI queries.
 
 Faculty members said the training, being held ahead of summer exams and   inspection, is aimed at improving administrative efficiency.
 
 “Teachers from across the state are getting training every year. What is the output? How much efficiency has been achieved in their work? The department must make this public,” they said.
 
 Regional joint director Anjali Rahatgaonkar defended the move though she said that the training is organized 3 or 4 times a year. 
 
 “Teachers don’t want to go but the training is compulsory. It is the director’s duty to see that academic activities are not affected,” she said.
 
 She added that during winter session the entire head office and mantralaya staff were asked to attend the training. “No exemption was given that time, so how can teachers be allowed to skip,” she asked.
