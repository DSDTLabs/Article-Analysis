NEW DELHI: With the guidelines for the 298 private schools on public land out on Saturday evening, parents are happy that the management   has been done away with. 

 However, those with a first child remain unsure about the sibling preference. On the other hand, schools and principals have decried the notification as an unfair move that creates divisions within private schools . 
 
 Minakshi Kushwaha, the principal of  , one of the schools on public land in Pushp Vihar, said the notification was unfair, and same rules must apply to all private schools.
 
 “Dividing them among those that have certain allotment clauses and those that don’t is unfair,” she said. “We must meet our members and decide our course of action on Monday,” said S K Bhattacharya, the president of the action committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools.
 
 Meanwhile, parents are in minds of litigating against the sibling rider, especially those with a single child. However, Director of Education   said the criteria was created keeping the best interests of parents in mind.
