DHARAMSHALA: Police headquarters in Kangra have formed a ‘Mahila cell’ to nab females involved in drug trade after a lot of cases in border areas of the district were found to have involvement of women, while the implementation was made after the crime meeting.

 The cell has started conducting raids. In the first attempt, the task has been started from the border areas of the district. Frisking has been going on at various areas on tip offs. According to the police and locals, this move has sent a strong message to drug rackets not to involve females as mode of transition. Police have nabbed around 40 females in last one year.
 
 Team has 14 female cops, including two sub-inspectors and 12 other members of police force. Raids were conducted in Bhadroa, Channi, Damtal and Indora. “The formation of this cell is going to bring good results in the near future in eradicating drug trade from the region,” said Sanjeev Gandhi, SSP in Kangra. 
 
 He further said the team will further move to courts for seizure of properties involved in drugs and confiscation of machines in illegal mining. “Drunk and drive traffic violators will be arrested. We have arrested around 25 such persons in last 15 days,” added Gandhi. Financial investigation in the matters of drug traders will be expedited and properties will be attached by freezing movable and in immovable assets, he said.
 
 Police had said that female groups in villages (mahila mandals) were acting as major source of information and cooperating in campaign against drugs, while people from other walks of life were also providing inputs.
