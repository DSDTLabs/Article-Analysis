In Thane, old notes are resurfacing everywhere. While the police is making regular seizures, early on Saturday morning, municipal cleaners found old notes in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 clogging a   in Naupada. This came just hours after the Thane police seized Rs 1 crore in   from two men near Talaopali.
 
  According to activist Binu Verghese, the Thane Municipal Corporation ( ) cleaners were called to   in Naupada after someone complained about an overflowing drain. “The area is a commercial hub and the roads were turning into a stinking pit because of the drain water flowing out,” Verghese said.
  
  The TMC janitors opened up the drain to find a choke-up and when they loosened it, they saw notes floating away. “We tried to get as many of the notes out as possible, but most of them had floated away by then,” said a cleaner.
  
  According to a police officer at the spot, “We salvaged at least a few thousands and as per what the cleaners described, close to a lakh was seen floating away.”
  
  When the Thane police commissioner was contacted for a comment, he said, “Anti-social elements know that if they try smuggling the money out, we will catch them. So they are flushing the old notes away. However, we will find them.”
  
 
 
  
  Earlier, on Friday night, two men were arrested by the anti-chain snatching squad for carrying Rs 1 crore worth of old notes. The two were identified as Manoj Cheda and Prathamesh Gawade from Parel and Dadar.
  
  According to senior inspector Ravindra Doiphode, the police had received a tipoff that some men were coming to a Talaopali hotel to exchange the notes.
  
  “We laid a trap at the location and caught them when they walked in. We searched their belongings thoroughly and found 6455 notes of Rs 1,000 and 7090 notes of Rs 500,” he informed the press.
