MUMBAI: The state government plans to reintroduce the domicile rule for   this year. "The high court's stay last year was ordered only for the petitioners and, therefore, does not apply to the current year," DMER director Dr   said. The decision has been taken, but the brochure is yet to be published. The admission process will start after NEET-UG results are declared. NEET is scheduled to be held on May 6. 

  Till 2016, students who had either completed class X and XII from   or students who completed class XII from here and also had a valid domicile were eligible for 85% of the state's seats. Last year, the state made all three requirements mandatory, making a set of students who had completed their class X from outside but done their Plus II from the state ineligible. This group had moved court and sought relief. 
 
 A DMER official said parents of such students claimed that they stayed near the state's borders and often it was more convenient to send their children to schools in other states. The bench had observed that the policy cannot be applied retrospectively.
 
 The official said the state will fight the case if parents move court again this year. There are around 2,800 seats in medical colleges in the state. "The competition to get a seat in medical colleges is fierce and our students usually don't get benefit in other states. They are forced to apply under the all-India quota. Even one mark makes a huge difference in NEET ranks and our students should get a fair chance," said a parent of a student from Mumbai. However, she added that the state needs to represent their case efficiently in courts.
