Vijayawada: City police have cracked down a number of thefts and robberies across their commissionerate limits back in 2017. However, for the third year in a row the number of cases thefts and robbery cases booked gives Vijayawada a dubious distinction of ranking number one in   offences compared to the rest of the state. According to the latest State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) data, the city witnessed 27.1% increase in robberies in 2017 compared to 2016. 

 However, the city also witnessed 12.8% decrease in ordinary thefts but still stands as number one compared to other 17 district/commissionerate police units in Andhra Pradesh. Police sources said that they have cracked down on a lot of cases in the past two years which shows a substantial increase in numbers. In 2016, the commissionerate witnessed 59 robberies and in 2017 they saw an increase to 75. It is also pertinent to note that the city also stands number one in terms of property lost and ranks sixth in property recovery rate. 
 
 When it comes to crime detection rate, Vijayawada stands 46% which is way below the state average of 63%. The city also witnessed few major property   like murder for gain and dacoity cases. In 2017, three dacoity cases including the famous gold heist worth Rs 5 crore took place in the city. In terms of murder for gain, the city witnessed four cases all of them targeting the elderly persons residing in their homes all by themselves. 
 
 On a positive note, the city saw a 4.4% decrease in house burglary cases in the city and stands at fifth place compared to other police units. After Vijayawada, the second most notorious city for property offences stands to be Visakhapatnam city. Senior police officials pointed that it isn’t surprising to see a bigger crime rate in the cities compared to rural areas. 
 
 “Normally, the commissionerate where population stands concentrated at a smaller region remains to be seen by the culprits as a land of opportunities but in terms of detection rates Vijayawada does an impressive job,” a senior police official said. Also, cops pointed a majority of the thefts are petty crimes from robbing cellphones to pickpocketing.
