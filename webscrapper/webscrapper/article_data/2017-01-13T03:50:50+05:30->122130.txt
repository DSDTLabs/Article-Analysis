MUMBAI: A   forum on Tuesday ordered a payout of Rs 2.9 lakh to a woman who underwent a hernia operation at a south Mumbai hospital in 2014. 

 The forum refuted Reliance General   Co Ltd’s defence that the   was repudiated on the grounds that she had not declared that she was a thalassemia minor at the time of taking the policy.
 
 The Central Mumbai District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum relied on the certificate obtained from the operating surgeon. 
 
 Referring to this, the forum said, “On going through this certificate, it is clear that thalassemia minor needs no treatment and there is no medical complication. The evidence on record shows that the complainant’s wife was operated for repair of abdominal wall hernia. Thus the opponent (insurance company) has wrongly repudiated the claim,” the forum said. The surgery cost the Gurnanis Rs 2.3 lakh. 
 
 The complaint was filed by the woman’s husband, Mukesh Gurani, in 2015 through the Consumers Welfare Association. According to the complainant, he and his family are covered under Reliance Healthwise Policy taken in 2009. Gurani’s wife and two daughters were covered under the policy for the total amount of Rs 3 lakh and he paid Rs 9,279 as premium. 
 
 Gurani's wife was hospitalized from September 18, 2014 to September 22, 2014. The surgery was performed on September 19, 2014, and Gurani submitted the claim to the insurance company. 
 
 In the complaint, he alleged that the insurance company issued two letters dated October 27, 2014, and November 11, 2014, inquiring about the treatment. Gurani also obtained a certificate from the operating clarifying that thalassemia was harmless and no treatment was required. 
 
 He alleged that the insurance company ignored the certificate and repudiated the claim through a letter dated November 22, 2014.
