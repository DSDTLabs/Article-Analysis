GAYA: Did   mislead former Union civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain? The answer appears to be affirmative.

 During his visit to Gaya on Wednesday, Shahnawaz told TOI he had spoken to senior AI officials to inquire about reports of withdrawal of Gaya-Delhi flight AI 433. “The airline officials told me the flight was being rescheduled only,” Shahnawaz told this reporter.
 
 However, the schedule subsequently released by the airlines show the daily flight has been cancelled three days a week -- on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. 
 
 Of course, the flight has been rescheduled too. As per the old schedule, the A-320 airbus takes off from Gaya at 2.15pm and reaches Varanasi at 2.55pm. It leaves Varanasi at 3.25pm to land at T3 of the   in Delhi at 5pm.
 
 According to the new schedule, the flight will leave Gaya at 8am every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday to reach Varanasi at 8.35am. Its take-off time from Varanasi will be 9.10am and arrival time in Delhi will be 10.40am.
 
  Dilip Kumar on Thursday said the four- day schedule would remain in force from March 10 to May 31.
