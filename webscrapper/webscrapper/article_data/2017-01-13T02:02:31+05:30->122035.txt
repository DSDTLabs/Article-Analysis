NEW DELHI: Air pollution is “slow death” high   said on Thursday, asking Punjab to put in place plans to prevent paddy crop burning by farmers this year.

 “We are of the view that the air quality of Delhi and surrounding areas is deteriorating each day and has attained alarming proportions. The action plan of Punjab should be substituted by a new one to ensure there is no paddy burning in 2017 itself,” a bench of Justices B D Ahmed and   directed.
 
 The order came after Punjab government in an affidavit informed that paddy burning can be eased out only by 2020-21.
 
 “Air pollution is a matter of life and death. It is a health-related issue. How can we ignore it,” the bench asked, adding that “when we can stop certain currency from use, why can’t   burning be stopped”.
 
 HC then asked the Centre and the Punjab government to work out a plan to implement its directions. “Punjab has stated in its affidavit that by 2019-2020 there would be a complete ban on the burning of the paddy residues. It means that the burning would continue in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as well,” it noted.
 
 This would mean that there would be approximately 9,000 tonnes of PM 2.5 emitted in the air and also that the figure for PM 10 (which includes PM 2.5) would be 10,000 tonnes.
 
 “These are alarming statistics, and particularly so, as they are the major contributors to pollution,” the court observed.
 
 HC asked the authorities to comply with its order and file a status report by February 2, the next date of hearing.
