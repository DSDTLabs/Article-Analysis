TIRUPUR: Villagers from   near   petitioned the district collector Dr K S   on Monday seeking to set up a police outpost in their village. 

 After the murder of an elderly couple and occurrence of various other crimes, the feared villagers informed the collector that they were ready to provide funds for constructing the outpost.
 
 Unlike surrounding villages, Nachipalayam was predominately a new settlement thanks to the real estate promoters. More than 5,000 people have settled in the area. “But so far, we have not received most of the developmental works including streetlights despite paying the taxes,” said a petitioner.
 
 “Apart from lack of illumination, the nature of the settlement brought an insecure factor, and it has become advantage for the miscreants to involve in petty crimes easily. Many burglary and chain-snatching incidents were reported in the village,” said V  , a resident.
 
 Now, the murder of the couple has brought more fears among the villagers. It was difficult to get help from the police if needed because   police station, under whose limits Nachipalayam falls, was about 18km away, said Pandiyarajan.
 
 So, many villagers, especially the women, feared to come out during night times. They hoped that the police presence will help to curb the crimes.
