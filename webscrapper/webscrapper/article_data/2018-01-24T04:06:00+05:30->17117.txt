Vadodara: Three persons were booked for forging signatures of a woman living on Old Padra Road and obtaining completion certificate and drainage connection from VAdodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) for a building on her ancestral land in Akota. The woman Meghna Desai lodged a complaint against Ramchandra Vaswani, architect Ashwin Dalal and Mafatlal Joshi, who helped the duo in forging her signatures on different applications forms. Desai had given a contract to construct a residential building on her land in Shrinagar Society last year. However, she later filed a complaint against Patel in June 2017 alleging that he had sold off some apartments in the building wihtout her knowledge and forging her signatures on the sale deeds. PAtel was later arrested and the building construction was stopped mid-way. Meanwhile, Ramchandra Vaswani, one of the accused in the Monday’s complaint, had purchased an apartment from Patel last year. When Desai recently visited building, she found that the there was water and drainage connection from VMC. When she checked with the civic body, Desai also found that Vaswani had applied for completion certificate naming himself as the president of the building even when the residents’ association was not formed. Dalal had stamped on the form as an architect approving the completion of building’s construction and Joshi’s phone number was mentioned in it. After getting completion certificate, the accused had also applied for water and drainage connection by forging Desai’s signature as the developer in the application form. After the irregularities were found, Desai raised objection with VMC and got completion certificate cancelled and water and drainage line snapped. Police have not arrested any accused yet.
