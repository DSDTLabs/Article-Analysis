GANDHINAGAR: The   (Amendment)   2017 was passed in the assembly on Thursday. It allows for regularizing some 7 lakh  , without converting the land use purpose.

 Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state revenue minister in his statement of objects and reasons, said, “During the last few years, with rapid economic and other developmental activities taking place in the state, there has come into existence certain transitional areas, where areas have enlarged beyond the limits fixed by the collector or by the survey officers and entirely new hybrid areas comprising an admixture of rural, semi-urban or urban areas have come in to existence, resulting in a change in traditional village, town or city areas of the state. 
 
 “The development taking place in such transitional areas in violation of the terms and conditions or restrictions provided for in such revenue laws have led to inchoate rights, titles and interests over the lands resulting in the records of rights and the register of mutations not showing the actual status of the holding of lands, etc., and therefore mass scale disparity in determining actual status of occupancies recorded in the record of rights and difficulties are faced in the smooth administration of the revenue laws. To resolve these issues and regularize all such properties, the government decided to bring this amendment under which all such property titles will now be regularized after payment of the prevalent fees.”
