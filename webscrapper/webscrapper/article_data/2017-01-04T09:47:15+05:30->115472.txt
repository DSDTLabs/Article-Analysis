HUBBALLI: One of the ancient monuments in Unkal, Chandramouleshwar temple, which was built by Badami Chalukyas, is crying for attention since years. 

 This   (ASI) -protected 900-year-old temple lacks security, basic facilities. Moreover, the surrounding area of the temple is being encroached by the people violating the law that bars construction works in the radius of 200 meters from the temple. 
 
 ‘We have urged ASI many a times to evict the families who are living in the area surrounding the temple but no action has been taken yet in this regard,” said  , activist and president of  , Hubballi. 
 
 Manoj also expressed his unhappiness over local politicians for not taking any steps to protect this historic temple. “Politicians irrespective of their political affiliations, have been putting pressure on ASI against evicting the families living in the vicinity of the temple. The ASI officials lack will to evict these families,’’ he said. 
 
 History professor Dr   said the temple, which was built by Chalukya dynasty of Badami during 11th or 12th century, has been declared as a protected monument by ASI. After having declared so, the department has not done anything to protect this temple. “Not even a compound wall has been built around the temple. As a result, the temple premises has turned into a playground for children. There are not even security guards,” he added. 
 
 When contacted, Reshma Savanth, deputy superintending archaeologist of Dharwad Circle, said the department has already aware of the situation at the temple and has sent a proposal to the director general of ASI, Delhi, to evict the families by providing them suitable compensation. They are waiting for the approval for the same. “We are not able to maintain the temple effectively due to lack of funds. As far as security is concerned, we will soon deploy security personnel after discussing with our higher ups,” she promised.
