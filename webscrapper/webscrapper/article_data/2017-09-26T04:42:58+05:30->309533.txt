CHANDIGARH: Taking selfies during the peak of Jat stir in February 2016 proved useful for a man accused of indulging in arson at   finance minister Captain  's family house in Rohtak.

 Ankit Kadian, who was booked by the   (CBI) for arson, attempt to murder and other charges under the IPC and various other sections of the Prevention to Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, was granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court, which accepted the premise that he happened to be clicking selfies there.
 
 "On perusal of photographs produced by CBI on August 23, 2016, I find that these are selfies clicked by the petitioner. These photographs do not suggest that the petitioner was leading any mob or was indulging in any arson. Tower location of the mobile phone of the petitioner near the site is also no reason to decline bail to him," said Justice Surinder Gupta. He added that Kadian should not absent (himself) from the hearing of the case in the trial court, nor leave the country.
 
 Kadian, whose presence was not recorded by any CCTV cameras near the minister's house, was booked by the CBI on the basis of mobile footage extracted from his phone. Counsel for the petitioner had argued that the photographs produced by CBI was not enough to deny him bail. He also pleaded for bail on parity as the court had granted bail last month to two other accused,   and  , in the same case.
