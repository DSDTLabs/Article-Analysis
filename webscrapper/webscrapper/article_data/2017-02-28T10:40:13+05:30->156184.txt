LUCKNOW:   (LU) administration has come up with a peculiar method of   ­ by designating 'girls only' entry gates for  .

 In a circular issued on Monday , LU announced separate entry gates for girls and boys appearing for its annual examination from March 1.“The separate gates for boys and girls have been allotted keeping the parking facility and the distance from the entrance gate to the examinations halls into consideration. Separate entry of girls will also keep unwanted chaos under control and provide safety and security to women students," university spokesperson Prof NK Pandey said.
 
 The university has asked boys to enter the campus by using gate numbers 1 and 2, and girls to use gate numbers 4 and 5. “The decision is a sign of growing conservatism on campus. Will separate entry points for girls really curb harassment and keep the two genders away?" a student asked. Entry to the campus will be made 30 minutes before the commencement of the exam,“ the circular, a copy of which is with TOI, reads. It is issued by chief proctor Prof Vinod Singh.
 
 The university has also instructed its postgraduate and PhD students coming to attend classes during examinations, to carry their identity cards.
 
 In the first week of February , principal of a Mumbai college had got sections in canteen demarcated for boys and girls with ropes.
 
 She had said the step had been tak en because “former students enter the campus and create ruckus in the canteen, they misbehave with girls."
