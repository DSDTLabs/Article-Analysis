GUWAHATI:   have summoned   on Sunday to quiz him in connection with a case filed against him by the state BJP for allegedly maligning the party's image. Bora, whose 'derogatory'   about a woman politician of the saffron party created an uproar in the state, was arrested by the CID on Saturday. However, he was granted bail a few hours later. 

 On Thursday, two cases were registered against Bora after he made the 'derogatory' statement. While IGP (administration) Pradip Saloi had filed a case with the CID, BJP general secretary Dilip Saikia, too, lodged a case against him. Bora said, "I'm ready to answer all the questions in court." 
 
 Earlier, CID sleuths searched Bora's Geetanagar residence and seized his cellphone and laptop.
