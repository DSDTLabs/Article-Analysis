NEW DELHI: Gangster  , who was on the run after murdering  , was arrested from   near   in southeast Delhi on Friday night. Pradhan, who has 13 cases registered against him, was nabbed after a brief exchange of fire.

 DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said a team led by inspector Rajender Kumar arrested Pradhan under IPC Sections and Arms Act.
 
 Police said that Pradhan was on the run after murdering Goyal on April 16 with the help of his two aides. Goyal, who also had a dozen cases of land grabbing against him, was formerly Pradhanâ€™s partner after the two met in Dasna Jail in 2008.
 
 Goyal, who was involved in land grabbing in western Uttar Pradesh, convinced Pradhan to join his gang. They grabbed a property in Barola Village in Noida, but later Goyal started avoiding h im, stopped his commission and even threatened to kill him.
 
 Enraged by this, Pradhan hired two criminals and shot Goyal outside the same property they had grabbed together. Later, a team of UP Police arrested the two criminals, but Pradhan had managed to escape. A reward of Rs 25,000 was kept on his arrest.
 
 Sleuths from the Delhi Police were tipped off about Pradhan coming towards Tughlaqabad in a white Maruti Swift. At 6.30pm, when the car was spotted, cops signaled it to stop. A chase ensued during which Pradhan even fired at the cops, but was later arrested.
