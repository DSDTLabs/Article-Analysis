 A joint forum of Delhi government employees, including IAS and Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar & Islands Civil Services (DANICS) officers, have been boycotting meetings with AAP ministers since the alleged assault on Prakash, demanding a written public apology from Kejriwal for the incident.
 
 "We have not changed our stand on the assault of the chief secretary, and that we all are united to fight for the dignity and safety of the chief secretary and all other government employees.

 "This was absolutely my personal visit..." Singh added.
