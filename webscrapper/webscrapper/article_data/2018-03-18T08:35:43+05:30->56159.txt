NEW DELHI: Besides logistical challenges and escalating operational cost of playing ‘home matches’ at multiple venues,   opted to play their home games only at the Ferozeshah Kotla this season because their newly-appointed coach   said he wanted the team to play the home games at a single venue.

 
 
 
 
 Sources told TOI that efforts were being made by both the franchisee and   to play at least two home matches outside Delhi and had considered Lucknow as one of the options. However, Ponting categorically told the operations department of the Daredevils that Delhi's home should be at the Kotla only. "Kotla should be Delhi's den. Everyone should fear entering it. Delhi should be based out of one home centre," Ponting is said to have told the officials. This put an end to the efforts to look at Lucknow and Raipur as Daredevils’ ‘away home venues’.
 
 
 
 
 In the past, DD have played a few games in Raipur, but the franchise couldn't create a huge fan base in that city because the fans only supported the players rather than cheering for the city team.
 
 Barring Kings XI Punjab, who are likely to play only three games at their home ground Mohali on April 15, 19 and 23 because of the shutting down of the Chandigarh airport from May12 to 31, all teams want their base at home venue. It is also seen as a departure from BCCI’s norm which mandates that a team has to play at least four matches at home venue. It is now emerging that Indore could host the last four home games of the Kings XI Punjab.
