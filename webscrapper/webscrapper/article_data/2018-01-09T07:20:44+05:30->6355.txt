KOLKATA: The road safety week, which was officially launched during the half-marathon organized by   on Sunday, has promised to be different.

 As cops begin their weeklong interface with school students and public transport drivers to instil traffic discipline among Kolkatans, cops this year will be harping on two new areas — no honking and lane driving.
 
 “Each year, we hold special campaigns to stop drivers from drink driving and riding helmetless. We agree that city roads are not always conducive to lane driving but we have identified some stretches like Red Road and EM Bypass, where this can be started,” said a senior traffic official at Lalbazar. While no-honking, as a concept, was introduced by cops in the city four years ago, this is the first time nohonking has been put at top slot in the road safety week.
 
 Police said that while educating drivers will be the top priority for cops on both issues, they will also begin to issue challans in the coming months as “nothing works better as a deterrent.”
 
 Drivers found indulging in improper lane changing, obstructing traffic and not driving in the designated lane, will also be charged.
 
 Reducing noise pollution by cutting down on meaningless honking will also be dealt with priority. As a beginning, police kept Monday as a nohonking day.
 
 “We have involved school children, who are trying to tell motorists not to honk without reason. Similarly, we will be observing a lane-discipline day,” explained an officer. Cops said the no-honking zone set up in College Street is a first-of-its-kind in the city and has come up mixed results.
 
 “Kolkata motorists are prone to using horns but rarely use them at the crossings. It is seen as a tool for overtaking. We are trying to reverse this mind set,” added the official.
