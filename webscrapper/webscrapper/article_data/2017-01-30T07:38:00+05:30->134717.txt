NEW DELHI: The apex consumer commission has directed real estate major   to pay over Rs 3 crore to a couple for failing to give them possession of an apartment booked under one of its housing projects at Noida in 2010.

 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) asked the firm to refund Rs 3.33 crore made by the complainants while purchasing the flat and compensate them in the form of interest at 10% per annum with effect from 2012.
 
 The commission, while deciding the complaint, rejected the claim of Unitech group of companies that the delay in handing over the flats to the buyers was on account of agitation by farmers and shortage of labour. “ As regards the alleged shortage of labour, no material has been placed on record to show that it (Unitech) could not get adequate work force to complete the construction of the flats despite efforts having been made in this regard,“ NCDRC said.
 
 A Unitech spokesperson said: “The company had gone to the Supreme Court against a similar direction from NCDRC earlier. The appeal in the apex court has already been admitted and we are waiting for the final verdict from SC. Meanwhile, the company is working to complete the project.“
