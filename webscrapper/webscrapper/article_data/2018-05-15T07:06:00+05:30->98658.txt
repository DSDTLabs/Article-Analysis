Chandigarh: Smooth functioning of department of   and welfare of industrialists seems not to be on the priority list of the UT administration if the short tenures of industries director are an indicator.

 In the last two years, six different officials have held the charge of the post, whose term ranged from 48 days to 165 days. The industrialists rued that the functioning of the department has been affected due to frequent change of guard.
 
 Tejbir Singh Saini held the charge for a period of just 48 days from October 17, 2017 to December 4, 2017, while the charge was taken away from Shilpy Pattar after serving for 55 days starting from June 19, 2017 to August 4, 2017. Kriti Garg was transferred after just 67 days of her appointment.
 
 Dr Tapasya Raghav held the post for 165 days, the longest tenure in two years, while Navjot Kaur was made the in-charge for 148 days. The incumbent director, Radhika Singh, is holding the charge from December 4, 2017.
 
 Functioning of micro and small enterprises facilitation council, which resolved payment-related issues of the micro and small enterprise units, has taken a toll. As per the MSMED Act, 2006, the council must resolve the cases within 90 days. However, due to frequent change of the director, who is chairperson of the council, the cases are getting delayed. The council has not held a meeting since last two months.
 
 Unhappy with the delay in settlement of cases, Industries Association of Chandigarh (IAC) has written to UT finance secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha for ensuring that the director is not changed frequently as it affects the functioning of the department. “Frequent change of director is impacting the functioning of the council. The administration should appoint director for a long tenure,” said Mahajan. “Transfer of director results in undue delay in finalisation of cases since the new incumbent takes times to study the cases,” he added.
 
 Naveen Manglani, president Chamber of Chandigarh Industries (CCI), maintained that their works get delayed. “Officers need some time to understand functioning of a department and issues pertaining to industries. In case of department of industries, the director is changed even before they get a hang of things,” said Manglani.
 
 He further said the post is very crucial as it acts as facilitator for the industrialists. “Frequent change is one of the key reasons for the long pending demands of the industry going unheard,” said Manglani.
 
 Over the years, industrialists have been at loggerheads with the administration for implementation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, in toto, besides other long-pending demands, which include need-based changes, enhancing ease of doing business.
 
 NO MEETING OF IAC IN 2 YEARS
 
 Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) constituted by the UT administration for redressal of issues pertaining to industries has not met since two years. Not only that, the committee has met just once since it came into being in September 2015. With an aim to deliberate and resolve long pending issues of the industry, the committee was constituted in September 2015 for two years.
