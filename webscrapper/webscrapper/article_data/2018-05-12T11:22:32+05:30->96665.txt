KOCHI: BJP is trying to indulge in a political game in court in the Varapuzha ‘custodial death’ case, the state government alleged before the   high court on Friday.

 The submission by senior public prosecutor   was in response to a petition filed by BJP state general secretary AN Radhakrishan to join in the case, filed by Sreejith’s wife Akhila, seeking a CBI probe.
 
 During hearing, the prosecution informed the court that it was strongly opposing the BJP leader’s plea as it was politically motivated and said that the government cannot agree to the attempt to play politics in court. When the wife of the deceased herself had come before the court, the BJP leader had no locus standi and his attempt was to play politics, the senior prosecutor argued while vehemently objecting to the BJP leader’s petition.
 
 The court was also informed that inspector-general S  , who heads the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case, has been camping in Kochi and directly supervising the investigation.
 
 Three policemen, a sub-inspector, and a circle inspector have been arrested by the SIT and four of them were still in custody. Four more police personnel have been made accused in the case, the senior prosecutor submitted while stressing that an effective investigation was on.
 
 Sreejith’s wife prayed for a CBI probe since she felt it was essential to bring out the conspiracy and the involvement of higher-ranking police officers in the case. Her counsel argued that Sreejith had died due to severe torture while in custody and that high-ranking police officials were involved in the case whereas only the involvement of lower-ranking policemen have been identified.
 
 While seeking to join the case filed by Sreejith’s wife,   alleged in the petition that the police officers involved in Sreejith’s case were acting under the directions of district-level leaders of CPM as the deceased was a BJP worker. The high court will hear the case again on May 22.
