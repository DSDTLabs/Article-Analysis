From the time the trailers of '  3' were launched, Amitabh Bachchan’s angry avatar has become a talking point. As the third installment of 'Sarkar', one of the most popular franchises nears its date with cinemas, fans have been increasingly eager to see Big B return to his angry avatar – one of the prime factors responsible for his unprecedented fame and superstardom – which not only continues till date, but has also made the Ram Gopal Varma-helmed series what it is.
Such has been the significant mark left on Indian cinema by the icon through the series that Varma cannot even imagine the idea of any 'Sarkar' film without him. Elaborating on why he thinks Bachchan is the only actor capable of taking on the role of Subhash Nagre and hold true the theme of the franchise with his performance, Ramu says, “I always believe that the heroism of Sarkar is not just about the physical representation of power, but it is about the ultra-quiet intensity in how he demonstrates it. And I sincerely think only   in the whole world can do ultimate justice to that. Frankly, I can imagine   without  , but not Sarkar without Amitji. He possesses the kind of magnetism and charisma to make the character come alive. The mythological mystique, the physical audacity, the grace and the instinct he possesses towards creating cinematic moments is what inspired me to make the first 'Sarkar' and 'Sarkar 3' is the ultimate testimony of that.”
 Well, that’s not something anyone would want to disagree with.
 'Sarkar 3', presented by Eros International and produced by Alumbra Entertainment, Wave Cinemas and AB Corp, releases May 12.
