THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A BJP   would call on Union home minister   in New Delhi on Tuesday, seeking immediate central intervention to restore the law and order situation in the state.

 Addressing a news conference after the party core committee meeting,   state president   told reporters here on Monday that the delegation led by him would brief the Union minister on the ‘CPM-sponsored violence’ in the state. Former state presidents P K Krishnadas and V Muraleedharan would be part of the delegation. Kummanam said the party core committee has decided to garner more public support to the party’s agitations against self-financing and private colleges.
 
 “The party has set up a three-member committee to devise strategies regarding similar unrests brewing in several self-financing colleges across the state,” he said. BJP national executive member V Muraleedharan and state general secretaries M T Ramesh and A N Radhakrishnan are the members of this sub-committee.
 
 “The difference of opinion between CPM and CPI is an internal matter of the LDF. But the CPM should introspect why even their allies are raising their voice against the party. The CPM-sponsored violence is taking place across the state. Police are misused to silence the CPM’s opponents,” he said.
 
 To highlight CPM atrocities, the BJP would on February 26 organize two marches carrying the ashes of Vimala Devi, the woman who died of burn injuries after CPM activists set her house on fire at Kanjikode in Palakkad district. The marches would culminate at Thiruvallam in Thiruvananthapuram and Manjeswaran in Kasaragod on March 3 where the ashes would be immersed.
