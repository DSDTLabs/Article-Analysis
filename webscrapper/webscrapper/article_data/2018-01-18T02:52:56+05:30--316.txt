NEW DELHI: Two men were   when an old   exploded at a scrap yard in   of Faridabad on Wednesday. The victims were identified as Chhotu and Uday Bhan. Preliminary probe revealed that the incident took place when the duo was separating metal parts from scrap.

 The intensity of the blast was such that their body parts were scattered nearly 300m away from the site. Police said a case had been registered and a probe was on. Javed, the scrap dealer, told police that the grenade could have been a part of a consignment of old explosives from a company in Haridwar. He said he wasn’t aware of the presence of hand grenades in it.
 
 The   caused panic among locals, who called the police. Security agencies were also put on alert. A team from Intelligence Bureau and special cell of Delhi Police inspected the site. Cops suspect that the grenade may have come from explosives “retired” by the army. A bomb disposal squad was called in and other potentially explosive materials were identified. The area was cordoned off.
 
 While Chhotu was a native of Bihar, Bhan used to live in nearby slums.
