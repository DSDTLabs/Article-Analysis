NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   on Moday launched a scathing attack on Uttar Pradesh chief minister   and said the   president had made a lot of promises in the past but had failed to deliver on them.

 "Akhilesh Yadav was busy striking alliances when he should have been working for the state's development," PM Modi said at a   rally in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The Prime Minister was referring to the alliance struck between the Samajwadi Party and the   ahead of the UP Assembly elections. However, this alliance has failed to save the fortunes of both parties, PM Modi claimed.
 
 "It's become evident after the first phase of polling that no alliance can redeem your past misdeeds," he said.
 
 Taking a dig at the SP's 'Kaam Bolta Hai' slogan, PM Modi brought up the high rates of crime in the state when he remarked, "You say 'Kaam Bolta Hai' (Work speaks for itself) but projects are incomplete. What is speaking volumes are the instances of women harassment in the state."
 
 The Prime Minister asked if the frequent cases of rape, murder and riots are what Akhilesh Yadav calls his 'work.' He then turned to the crowd and said, "The people of Uttar Pradesh are not fools. They're well aware that criminals are still operating their gangs from behind bars."
 
 Modi then alluded to the recent feud between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle  , which nearly split the Samajwadi Party right before the UP polls. 
 
 "Governments aren't made for promoting discrimination, communalism, caste or 'bhai-bhatijawaad'. They're meant for the poor, disadvantaged and marginalised," PM Modi said.
 
 Continuing his pitch for women's safety, PM Modi evoked the bond of Rakshabandhan as he appealed to the female voters of the state.
 
 "Your brother in Delhi wants to protect you. Give us the opportunity to serve and you'll see," he said.
