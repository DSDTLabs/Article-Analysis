MUMBAI: Suburban station infrastructure, including foot over-bridges (FOBs) and escalators, in the   is expected to get a major boost as railway officials expect a substantial allocation of funds for the 2018-19 financial year.

 All stations with a footfall of over 25,000 will have escalators, announced Union finance minister Arun   in his budget speech on Thursday. This means almost all stations in Mumbai will get escalators, as the footfall exceeds 25,000 at these.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 FOBs were categorized as safety features after the   tragedy, in which 23 people died in a stampede on September 29, 2017. “We have not yet received figures for the budgetary allocation to FOBs, but there are indications that there will be enough funds for FOB-related work,” said a senior CR official.
 
 Jaitley also announced that all railway stations and trains will be progressively provided with Wi-Fi, and   cameras will be provided at all stations and trains to enhance security of passengers.
 
 Railway officials indicate that 30 FOBs were planned on priority in Mumbai’s suburban rail section, with an expenditure estimate of around Rs 200 crore.
 
 An official said, “Work on FOBs has gained pace and is likely to be completed within eight months. Payment will have to be released to contractors for the work.”
