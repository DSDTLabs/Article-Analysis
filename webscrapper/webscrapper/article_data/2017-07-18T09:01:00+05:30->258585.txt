Panaji: While there is much speculation about what direction   department will follow in promoting and marketing “destination Goa”, Menino D’Souza, who recently took over as the director of tourism said it would do well if it takes care of three issues, namely garbage, transportation and beach shacks. 

 “Goa is well-known international tourist destination, it will have to focus on three aspects—garbage management, shacks and transportation — which are vital for its growth,” he said.“We have to take care of the three things, first,” said D’Souza.
 
 Goa’s   continue to draw tourists, but some of the beaches with higher concentration of tourists such as Calangute, Candolim, Baga, Colva et al are losing their sheen. The tourism department appointed agency though carries out the task of picking up garbage from beaches on a regular basis, these beaches don’t appear to be clean as they should have been.
 
 A tourism official who did not want to be named, said private beach shacks located close to the shoreline, are the main culprits. They don’t hesitate to dump solid waste in the open. 
 
 “Fluttering plastic bags and empty plastic bottles in open spaces just outside any beach are due to private shacks,” he said. 
 
 Private shack operators, who earn their bread and butter, because of tourism should behave little more responsibly, the official said.
 
 Tourists, especially domestic, often complain that transportation in the state comes at a premium. Also, complaints against taxi operators are a plenty. Without pointing fingers at anyone in particular, the tourism director said, transportation system has to improve.
 
 D’Souza said though beaches hold sway, serious attempts have to be made to showcase and market hinterlands of  . “I do accept that infrastructure facilities have to be raised if hinterlands of the state have to come into focus,” he said.
