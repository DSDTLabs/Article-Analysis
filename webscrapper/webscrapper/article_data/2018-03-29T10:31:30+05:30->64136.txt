 We envision a very bright future for the employees as AI will be a great global airline. Employees have arrears of Rs 1,298 crore and the government has decided that this amount will be paid by it and not be transferred to the airline. We are going to carve out Esops from the 24% stake that the government retains. That way employees will also own the new AI. There will be other important safeguards for protecting employee interests which will be spelt out in the request for proposal.
  
  
 
 
  will have to be managed on an armsâ€™ length basis and cannot be merged with any other entity. Its identity as a separate airline has to be maintained for at least three years. The brand name Air India will have to be retained. The period for which this will have to be done will be spelt out in the RFP. We have ensured AI has an independent existence for at least three years and that it remains a domestic airline with the substantial ownership and control with Indians.
 
 
 
 
 We are creating AI Asset Holding company, which will have non-core real estate and art collection of AI, among other things. The art and artefacts will be handed over to the ministry of culture which will, in turn, give them to museums.
