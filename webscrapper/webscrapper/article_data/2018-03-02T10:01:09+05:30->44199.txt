SURAT: The   officials removed encroachment from roads and markets in   on Wednesday. 

 The area, one of the biggest retail markets of daily use items and clothes in the city, has at least 5,000 vendors who sell their wares by the roadside. Many of them have encroached upon the footpath space opposite big shops and pay rent to shop owners. It is difficult to even ride a bicycle through this area in the morning and evening hours because an estimated 5,000 vendors sit illegally by the roadside and on footpaths to sell their goods in Chauta Bazaar, which is visited by at least 1 lakh people daily. 
 
 However, on Wednesday, SMC teams reached the area for the first time along with police teams. Presence of policemen saw to it that the mission of encroachment removal was carried out peacefully. About 45,000 square feet of public road was opened up for traffic and at least 500 shopkeepers taken to task. 
 
 “We removed shop stands, hangers, protected roofs, unauthorized hoardings, hanging angles, roofs, stands, hand carts, etc. Roads were opened up and the goods of vendors confiscated,” said D C Gandhi, zonal chief of the central zone.
