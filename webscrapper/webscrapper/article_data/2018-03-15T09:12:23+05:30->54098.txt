KOLKATA: There is still no clarity on when the   and   will merge into one entity. But come Thursday, a new tournament will kick off featuring all 20 teams from both leagues. The  , to be played in a knockout format at Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Stadium, is replacing the Federation Cup, but there is no AFC Cup berth on offer.

 
 The qualifying round will see the bottom four teams of the two leagues battle with each other to join the top six of both leagues in the 16-team tournament proper. The ISL teams, comprising of more accomplished Indian and foreign players, have the edge over the I-League outfits - at least on paper. But football, like any other sport, can throw up surprises.
 
 The four qualifiers, to be played on Thursday and Friday, could produce some interesting duels.
 
 Two-time ISL champions   had an absolutely forgettable campaign, just about managing to avoid the wooden spoon. Now that they have got a second chance, ATK will be eager to salvage their season with a strong showing in the Super Cup. They first have to overcome the challenge of Chennai City on Friday, in what will be the last of four qualifiers.
 
 The Kolkata-based side has changed coach twice this season, Teddy Sheringham making way for Ashley Westwood and the latter being replaced by Robbie Keane. ATK’s woes were compounded by an eight-match winless run in the second phase.
 
 
 
 
  Delhi Dynamos vs Churchill Brothers (5 pm); NorthEast United FC vs Gokulam Kerala (8pm) 
 
 
  Mumbai City FC vs Indian Arrows (5 pm); ATK vs Chennai City (8 pm).
