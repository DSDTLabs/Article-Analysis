VIJAYAWADA: The city may be revelling in the fact that it has climbed to rank 19 in  , residents say that not all is hunky-dory. 

 "Though VMC officials indulged in a publicity blitzkrieg before the survey, urging citizens to take part in the Swachh survey, and also tried to showcase the arterial MG Road to Swachh representatives, some parts of the city needed to be revved up in terms of sanitation," said a public health wing official.
 
 When contacted, a senior VMC official admitted that better coordination on the part of the three departments of the corporation could have helped. "Had the officials done a coordinated job and completed pending works on public toilets and usage of scientific dumping yard in time, we would have definitely been in the top 10," the official said.
 
 A VMC official said that Visakhapatnam and Tirupati fared better by appointing consultants to take care of sanitation. "We were also hamstrung by lack of funds,"' he added.
