CHENNAI: Wondering whether the ‘orderly’ system in police force has been really abolished in Tamil Nadu by virtue of a government order passed in 1979, Madras high court has said it would be constrained to summon the home secretary, if a proper explanation was not given on the existence of such a system, after 38 years of its abolition.

 Justice N   has also directed the home secretary to furnish details as to how many personnel are deployed as   at the residences of top  , and retired officials.
 
 Also pulling up the government for not constituting a committee headed by a retired high court judge to look into problems faced by police force, and to check desertions, absenteeism and suicides committed by police personnel, the judge gave time till March 22, failing which the home secretary should appear in the court on that day.
 
 This apart, the judge also wanted the home secretary to answer as to why not the government appoint office assistants or servant maids in the residence of present officials as well as retired officials through public department, as done in the residences of ministers and high court judges. Besides this, the secretary has been directed to provide information on the number of people declared ‘deserters’, number of personnel dismissed from service and number of people who committed suicide, all in the past 10 years. He also wanted total vacancy in the force, and whether the strength of the force is periodically increased in consonance with the increase in population.
 
 While passing the orders, Justice Kirubakaran observed that it would not be in the interest of the police and public to postpone the constitution of a committee as per the 2012 order the court, considering the fact that 182 cases of suicides by police personnel had been reported since 2010, in addition to about 700 desertions.
