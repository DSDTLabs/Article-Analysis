Tirunelveli: The 1,000 mega watt unit-I of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) suffered a technical snag and has gone offline from 9.11am on Thursday. It may be recalled that unit-II of KKNPP is already offline from February 19, taking the total power generation of the 2,000 MW plant to zero.

 An official at the plant told TOI that the turbine of unit-I suffered a minor technical snag and that it would be back to power generation in a day or two. However, it would take time to achieve its full production capacity of 1,000 MW.
 
 About unit-II, the official said that it was shut down for annual maintenance and refuelling on February 19. He hinted that it would take about 60 days from the date of shutting down for the plant to resume power generation.
