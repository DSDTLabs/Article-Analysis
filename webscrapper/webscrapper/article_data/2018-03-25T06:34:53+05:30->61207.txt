KOLKATA: A film on a street physician who has been serving Kolkata’s poor for three-and-a-half decades has won the Special Jury prize at the Indian World Film Festival in Hyderabad. ‘Doctor Jack’ was among films from 90 countries that were screened.

 The subject of the film,  , arrived in Kolkata in 1979 when he was deported from   after he exposed a child-smuggling racket there. In Kolkata, he began providing free medical care to those living on the streets. Alone at first, and with very little money, he opened his medical bag and started treating patients on the pavement under a flyover.
 
 Over time, Western travelers who saw the vital work he was doing stopped to offer money and help. Despite repeated challenges, he set up a charity,  , and established a series of street clinics and schools which have helped more than half a million people over the past 38 years.
 
 Benoit Lange, the film maker and Swiss photo-journalist who has supported Dr Preger’s work for three decades, made the film because he greatly valued Pregger’s work and did not expect recognition to come his way instead. “I did not expect this recognition. In my experience, social inequality has been a taboo subject in India. But societal norms seem to have changed considerably in the last 10 years, and the emerging middle class is becoming more attuned to social issues. I have witnessed a real step change in terms of what is being done to tackle inequality and perhaps this award signifies that,” he remarked.
