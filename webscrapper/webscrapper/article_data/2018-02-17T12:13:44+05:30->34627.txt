PATNA: In a bid to settle down the difference in the ruling coalition in Bihar, former Bihar CM and   president   on Friday said his party would support the NDA candidate from Jehanabad assembly constituency in the byelection scheduled for March 11.

 Earlier, HAM-S and RLSP headed by Union minister   put claims over Jehanabad seat, which fell vacant after the demise of its MLA   in October last year.
 
 HAM-S national spokesperson Danish Rizwan said, “The core committee of the party had authorized Manjhi to take a final decision on fielding its candidate from Jehanabad. Though Jehanabad committee of the party had recommended for contesting the polls, Manjhi ji decided not to field any candidate in order to avoid tussle in the alliance.”
 
 Manjhi, who is his party’s lone MLA, has been lately showing signs of strains with respect to sharing of seats in the next assembly elections slated to be held in 2020. He recently said minority communities were not being given justice in the state government and added that his party would need at least 50 seats in the upcoming assembly elections to take important decisions in favour of the scheduled castes.
 
 With Manjhi withdrawing from Jehanabad seat and JD(U) not contesting the bypolls, it’s now between BJP and RLSP to decide on   and Jehanabad and Bhabhua assembly seats.
 
 On Thursday, RJD and Congress had worked out a formula that the former would contest from Araria and Jehanabad while the latter from the Bhabhua assembly seat.
