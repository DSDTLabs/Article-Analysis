KOLKATA: The city shivered at 10.6°C on Sunday. For the first time in five years, the mercury dipped below 11°C. Though the Met office predicted a slim chance of the temperature dropping below 10°C, meteorologists said the mercury could slide slightly. The chilly spell will continue for now.

 “Chances of the minimum temperature dipping below 10°C is low. However, the mercury could climb down further by a few points. The next couple of days will have the temperature hovering between 10°C and 11°C. The prevailing conditions are conducive for the cold spell to extend further, at least for the next four days,” said G K Das, director ( ) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.
 
 The mercury had plunged below 10°C only twice in the last decade. It plummeted to 9°C on January 9, 2013, making it the coldest day in a decade and in 2011, it touched 9.6°C on January 12. Sunday at 10.6°C — three notches below the normal mark — was the fourth coldest day in 10 years, slightly warmer than the 10°C recorded on January 15, 2012.
 
 The cold spell this year started on January 3, when the city recorded a minimum temperature of 13°C, a dip of two notches from the previous day. The next day, it slipped further to 12.6°C and then to 11.1°C on Friday. Even as it climbed marginally on Saturday, it dropped again on Sunday to the delight of Kolkatans.
 
 “There has been snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, where the northwesterly wind originates. And the entire northern region, like UP, Uttarakhand and neighbouring Bihar, is under a cold spell. At present, there is no weather system that will block the northwesterly’s path,” said Das 
 
 The northwesterly wind is flowing in at speeds ranging between 25kmph and 30kmph. A western disturbance or a cyclonic circulation is capable of slowing it down, but none exists at present.
