VADODARA: If all goes well, the   ( ) will have a sprawling campus of around 100 acres in the near future. The state government has allotted land for the campus around six months ago and the university is working towards removing tenants on it.

 The land had five plots of private holding that were being used for agriculture. Sources said that those holding possession of these plots had been tenants since a long time. Around 30 acres of land was held by the tenants. Sources said that the land held by the tenants was spread in such a way that without acquiring it, holistic planning of the campus would not be possible. SGGU officials have taken up the issue with the district collectorate that is looking into the issue. 
 
 District collector   said that the university officials had held a meeting with him soon after he took charge recently. “The officials have informed me that four of the five tenants are more or less willing to vacate the area. They are trying to convince the last one. If needed, we will provide help to the university,” said Langa. Sources said that it was difficult to provide a large piece of land that did not have any tenants or encroachments. “Such problems are bound to exist when a large land mass is considered,” said an official. Funds have also been earmarked for developing the campus. The land has a road passing through it.
 
 While SGGU vice chancellor was not available for a comment, a senior official said that once the issue of the tenants is resolved the measurement of the land to decide its boundaries will be conducted. “We will get possession of the land after this and start planning after a survey is completed,” said the official.
