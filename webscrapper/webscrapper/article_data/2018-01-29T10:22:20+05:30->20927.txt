BHOPAL: Teachers at an   in   made students take a pledge on Republic Day not to vote for   until online examination is stopped. A video of it has gone viral, leading to a BJP demonstration outside the college on Sunday.

 The oath-taking has come as an embarrassment to the ruling party in election year and with the bizarre displays of resentment seen in recent times - a man in   printed wedding cards of his son with the message 'hamari bhool, kamal ka phool', and a shopkeeper used the same slogan on his receipts.
 
 The teachers of   seemed more upset by online exams than students. They made students take a vow "not to vote for BJP or work for the party in the elections" unless online tests were stopped. The students are heard repeating that they will spread "awareness in their district about corruption and injustice of BJP". The video ends with 'Jai Hind'.
