PANAJI: In a surprising turn of events, councillor   on Saturday withdrew from the race for the post of the mayor of the Corporation of the City of   (CCP) citing “personal reasons”. Former St Cruz MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’  , who had initially backed Madkaikar, has now said he would finalise a fresh candidate when the dates for the mayoral polls are announced.

 The Monserrate-backed panel of councillors had met on February 28 and had unanimously proposed the name of   as the mayoral candidate. Monserrate, who is the leader of the ruling panel of 17 councillors, had earlier confirmed that he was keen to replace current mayor  .
 
 “I met Babush and I told him that I want to withdraw,” Madkaikar said. 
 
 “I will decide who will be the next mayor when the date of the mayoral elections is announced. Right now all councillors are in my mind,” Monserrate said.
 
 The elections for the post of the mayor and deputy mayor are slated for March 14. Furtado continues to nurture hope that Monserrate will back him for another term. But sources said the Taleigao strongman and Furtado appear to have fallen out of favour.
