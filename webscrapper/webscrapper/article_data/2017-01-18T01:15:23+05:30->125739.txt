Mumbai: Two years ago when war broke out in  , its effect was felt at the   where the workload went up as flights from Europe to South Africa were re-routed through the  . To prepare the air traffic management authorities for such contingencies brought on by war or natural calamities, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a United Nations agency, has convened a two-day meeting in Mumbai this week.

 The two-day “air traffic management special co-ordination meeting”, which begins on Thursday, will be attended by delegates from the Asia Pacific (  from India), the Middle East and countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Mauritius, Seychelles and Oman.
 
 “One of the topics on the agenda is preparation of a contingency plan, a response framework for Asia-Pacific countries, to ensure continuation of aircraft operations during war, volcano eruptions, etc,” said an aviation official. For instance, one of the recommendations is that each country should form an air traffic management contingency central coordinating committee (CCC) for the development, maintenance, activation and conduct of contingency plans. The CCC should include representations from the aviation regulatory authority, air navigation service provider, military and other relevant national authorities. More importantly, the CCC will form an operational contingency group to oversee air traffic operations 24 hours a day throughout the contingency period.
 
 Another subject on the agenda is India’s draft proposal for creation of additional air traffic service routes over the Arabian sea as the existing route does not meet the demand. The proposal cannot be taken forward without coordination and an agreement signed among India, Seychells, Somalia and Yemen.
