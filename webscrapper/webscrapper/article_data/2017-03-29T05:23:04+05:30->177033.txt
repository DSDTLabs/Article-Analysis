THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The family of a man, who was   at Chirayinkeezh   has refused to accept the body, leaving the Chirayinkeezhu police in a lurch. Soman (75) was a destitute who used to eke out a living by seeking alms in and around the railway station. He was found dead at the platform on Tuesday morning.

 The police shifted the body to the mortuary of the medical college hospital and tried to find his relatives. They managed to find his son with the help of panchayat members in the area. “But, his son refused to come and receive the body saying that his father had left the family more than 20 years ago,” said ASI Manoharan. Next, the police contacted the son-in-law of the deceased, but the response was same as that of the son.
 
 By evening they managed to locate the family of the sister of the deceased, who lived at Poovampara at Attingal. However, they have not yet taken any decision.
 
 The ASI said that the police would wait for a few more days and if no one turns up, they would make arrangements for cremating the body on the government’s expense.
