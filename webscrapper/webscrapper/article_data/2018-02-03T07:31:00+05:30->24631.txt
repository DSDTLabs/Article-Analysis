CHANDIGARH: Two-time   MP from Faridkot   could soon make a comeback in the Congress, which he had left in 2015. Brar had resigned from the post of   president of Mamata Banerjee-led   last month.

 Speculation is rife that he is in touch with leaders in Delhi and could return to the party fold even though he apparently did not enjoy a good equation with chief minister   when he quit the Congress.
 
 When contacted, Brar said he has kept all options but maintained that there was nothing concrete about his next political move as yet.
 
 A Congress leader claimed that Brar was considered among senior party leaders when he had parted ways. “He will surely be a force multiplier, especially against the Akalis,” he said. Brar had quit the Congress just when campaigning for Punjab assembly elections was picking up.
 
 Brar remained a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee for 10 years, was AICC general secretary from 2010 to 2013, and secretary from 1999 to 2010. He was also general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress from 1983 to 1989. He lost two   elections in 2004 and 2009, both the times by a narrow margin.
 
 Before he joined TMC, Brar had also extended support to the Aam Aadmi Party for the assembly elections in 2017. He was earlier suspended by the Congress for criticising the party’s functioning after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and suggesting that then Congress president   and vice-president   ought to take a break and hand over the party’s reins to somebody else.
