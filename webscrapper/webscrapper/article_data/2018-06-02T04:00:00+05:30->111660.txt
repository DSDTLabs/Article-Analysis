Rajkot: A doctor lodged a complaint on Thursday evening against four persons, including a woman, for extorting Rs 29.48 lakh by blackmailing him after ensnaring him in a honey trap in Khambhaliya of Devbhoomi Dwarka district. 

 According to the complaint lodged by Dr Paras Vithalani (32), a resident of Khambhaliya, he was approached by Khushbu Mithilesh Singh, a native of Uttar Pradesh, who had visited his clinic as a patient four years ago. 
 
 Khushbu developed friendship with Dr Vithalani and started inviting him to her home whenever she fell ill. When Khushbu’s friends Abdul Sheth, Dilipsinh Jadeja and Abid Sanghar came to know about it, they decided to trap the doctor. 
 
 “The accused started blackmailing Dr Vithalani with the threat of framing him in a fake rape case with Khushbu and extorted Rs 29.48 lakh from him in the past four years. The accused are yet to be arrested,” an official from Khambhaliya police station said. tnn
