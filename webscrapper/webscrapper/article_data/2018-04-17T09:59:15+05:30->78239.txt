 LONDON: People living in crowded urban areas are more likely to see birds that can cause a nuisance than those that make us genuinely happy, a study has found.

 Researchers at the   and the   in the UK found that crowded urban areas have fewer songbirds such as tits and finches, and more potential ‘nuisance’ birds, such as pigeons, magpies and gulls. They examined ratios of birds-to-people and found areas of high-density housing have fewer birds.
 
 People in green and leafy suburbs see up to three and a half times more songbirds and woodpeckers — which are associated with a positive impact on human wellbeing — than birds whose behaviours can cause a nuisance, the study found.
 
 They found 1.1 birds per person that make us happy, and 0.4 birds per person whose behaviours cause a nuisance.
