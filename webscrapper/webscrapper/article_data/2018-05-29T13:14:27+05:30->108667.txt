PATNA: Chief minister   on Monday said dogs used to roam in state government hospitals and occupied beds before he formed government in 2005.

 
 Recalling an incident of 2004, the CM said a dog jumped down from the hospital bed when he, as the local MP, had gone to see a journalist, who had been admitted to   hospital at Biharsharif in   district.   was then the Lok Sabha member from Nalanda.
 
 “As soon as I entered the room where the journalist was admitted, a dog jumped down from another bed in the same room. Several other beds in the room were vacant as people those days avoided visiting government hospitals due to poor medical facilities. As many beds were vacant, one of them was occupied by a dog,” Nitish said while addressing a health department’s programme at ‘Samvad’ auditorium here.
 
 He said, “These days, some people have developed the habit of uttering anything baseless against the present government, but they should recall the scenario in government hospitals before November 2005. They should recall how majority of beds used to remain unoccupied in government hospitals. But today, such a large number of people are preferring government hospitals that some of them are not able to get beds.”
 
 Nitish said soon after coming to power in the state, his government conducted a survey of government hospitals in February 2006. The survey revealed that only 39 patients had been visiting a primary health centre (PHC) per month during those days. “Taking it as challenge, we began to work for improving things in government hospitals. A scheme to provide necessary medicines free was launched in August 2006. We conducted a fresh survey of patients’ footfall at government hospitals in November 2006. The second survey revealed 1,500-2,000 patients on an average visiting a PHC per month,” the CM said.
