CHANDIGARH: Northern Railways general manager R K   said on Wednesday that the pace of projects underway at Chandigarh railway station was slow and officials would have to pull up their socks to speed things up.

 Kulshrestha’s statement came during an inspection of the station on Wednesday. He pulled up officials after finding water leaking from a pipe near the staircase connecting platforms. “Though it seems like a minor glitch, it is unsafe. Anyone, be it a passenger or a railways employee, can slip on the wet floor,” he said, instructing officials to get the leak plugged “immediately”.
 
 During the inspection, he said electricity wires installed at the station should be laid underground. He inquired from the officials about the status of lifts that are being installed at all three platforms of the station.
 
 Officials informed the general manager the work of installing ab escalator from Panchkula side would be completed by August-end. They informed him that there was also a proposal for separate entry and exit point to the station from Panchkula side. At present, the station has just one entry and exit point, on the Chanidgarh side, and that causes traffic snarls on that side of the station, they added.
 
 Officials of the division said a proposal for installing CCTV cameras at the station had been sent to the railways ministry, but it was yet to be approved. On hearing this, the GM said the installation of CCTV cameras and other security equipment could take up to a year.
 
 When asked if there were any plans for developing Mohali railway station, officials of   informed the GM that there were no such plans.
 
 The GM said the French company which had been working on the semi high-speed project would submit its report on   stretch in September.
