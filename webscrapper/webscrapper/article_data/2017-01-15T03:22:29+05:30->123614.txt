KOLKATA: After eluding the city for about a fortnight, during which the temperature kept fluctuating, the   plunged to the season’s lowest — 11.9°C — on Saturday. With the   blowing in, Sunday could be even chillier. The cold spell may last till Tuesday when a western disturbance starts pushing the mercury up, according to the Met office.

 So far, the lowest this season had been 12.7°C, recorded on December 16.
 
 Even though the mercury remained at 13.5°C, Friday had been cool. The breeze carried a bite and the promise of a chilly weekend. The Met office had predicted a drop to 12°C. It turned out to be a notch cooler. “This chilly spell had been in the making for several days now. The conditions had been steadily turning favourable for a mercury drop. With no interference, the slide happened. It will remain cool for at least 48 hours more. The mercury may drop further on Sunday. It may rise marginally on Monday but it will remain well below normal,” said  , director,   (RMC).
 
 Since the western disturbance hasn’t moved much from the Jammu & Kashmir region, it may have a minor impact on the south Bengal weather this week. It could eventually block the north-westerly, though, resulting in a temperature rise. “It will still remain cold, but the minimum temperature will be above 12°C. As of now, the disturbance doesn’t seem threatening enough,” said Das.
 
 Meanwhile, a cold-wave warning was issued for nine districts in the state – Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur and Malda. On Saturday, the minimum temperature remained 3-4°C below normal across the south Bengal districts. “Most of these districts are already reeling under severe cold. While Malda recorded 8°C, Sriniketan 6 and Bankura recorded a minimum of 8°C.
