Lakshmi’s younger sister Gnanasundari was also running a hotel at Thanneer Pandal. Both family members often visited their temple located in Madurai.
 
 During one of the visits in 2016, the family members met Prabhu, a   from Madurai, and employed him as a cook in their hotels. Prabhu was initially working in the hotel owned by Gnanasundari and later shifted to Lakshmi’s hotel.

Lakshmi had given Rs 200 to Prabhu and advised him to go to his home town in Madurai. However, on February 2, Prabhu came to the hotel and doused Kannan with petrol and set him ablaze. While Prabhu managed to escape, Lakshmi, her son and locals took Kannan to the   and Hospital (CMCH).
 
 Based on Lakshmi’s complaint, the   police registered a case under section 307(attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. On February 22, Kannan was shifted to the Theni government hospital where he died on February 27 without responding to treatment.
