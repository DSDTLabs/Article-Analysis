NAVI MUMBAI: Twenty-two year-old swimmer from Nerul, Shubham   braved choppy waters to complete the   marathon swim on Monday. H e took a little morethan 10 hours to complete the round. 

 According to Northern California Open Water Swimming Association (NCOWSA) officials, Vanmali is the youngest in the world to have attempted the challenge and the first from India to achieve the feat. 
 
 He is the 12th person to complete the 16.1km marathon swim in the San Francisco Bay. The swim, considered to be as the most technically challenging in the bay waters, has been attempted by more than 25 people over the past 40 years. "He has surpassed one of the biggest challenges in his career," said his father Dhananjay. "We were happy to have Vanmali as the first Indian swimmer on record for the NCOWSA," said NCOWSA board member Steve Walker. 
 
 Walker, who is an accomplished open water marathon swimmer and has completed six of the Oceans Seven swims, was impressed by the young Indian swimmer. 
 
 "It's tricky on the best day, and most people fail. The fact that he gutted it out for over 10 hours in 12-degree water with the tide against him was mind-blowing." 
 
 The course requires the swimmer to leave through the opening of Aquatic Park, swim past Alcatraz Island,around Angel Island through a body known as Raccoon Strait before returning past Alcatraz and back through the narrow opening of Aquatic Park, recounted Vanmali. 
 
 One has to also cross three international shipping lanes twice, 12 ferry routes and face cross-currents for most part of the stretch in 10-14 degree waters, he added. 
 
 Vanmali is currently in San Francisco preparing for his swim across the Molokai Channel in June as part of his goal to complete the Oceans Seven swim series, a feat achieved by only 10 people to date.
