A pair of gold pendant earrings from the collection of  , the last Sikh queen of Punjab, will be auctioned in London later this month. 

 The earrings, which belonged to the youngest and last wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, are estimated to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000 (Rs19 lakh and Rs 28 lakh) at the Bonhams auction on April 24.
 
 Jindan Kaur was the only wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh not to commit sati on his funeral pyre after his death in 1839. The mother of  , the last Sikh maharaja, was appointed de facto ruler of Punjab in 1843 before being deposed and captured by the   in 1846.
 
 "These gold earrings are beautiful pieces of jewellery in their own right. They are also an important reminder of a courageous woman who endured the loss of her kingdom, and persecution and privation, with great dignity and fortitude," said Oliver White, Bonhams head of Islamic and Indian art.
 
 She was deposed, separated from her son and imprisoned. Her personal wealth was confiscated and the Punjab treasury that included the Koh-i-Noor and the Timur Ruby was plundered by the British who sent back these to London as gifts for Queen Victoria.
 
 Jindan Kaur made a daring escape from captivity, and fled to Kathmandu where the Nepal king kept her under virtual house arrest at the behest of the British. Duleep Singh was sent to England, converted to Christianity and adopted as a godson by Queen Victoria. Mother and son were eventually reunited after more than 13 years in 1861 when Jind Kaur moved to England. She died in 1863. AGENCIES
