LUCKNOW: This  , be ready to cook, eat and celebrate ‘Khichdi’ with a difference when people from across faiths will come together outside a mosque in   to share the agricultural festival’s joy with one another on Sunday. With all the ingredients for the khichdi crowd-sourced and volunteers from all faiths, the community feast ‘Sabke saath khichdi’ is a citizen driven attempt to blur differences.

 A combined effort of Shoulder to Shoulder (S2S) Foundation, Srijan Peeth, Insani Biradari, Awaam Movement and  , the community feast will be held outside the mosque in Indira Nagar’s C-Block from 11am onwards.
 
 “All the material for the khichdi, from the rice and daal, to pure desi ghee and spices has been sent to us by people from across the country. Packages of rice have been sent to us through e-retail sites too by those who were not able to deliver it personally, which has been very encouraging,” said S2S member Asif Khan.
 
 All the food to be served will be prepared at the venue and as members of the organisation said, the quantity to be served will depend on the quantity of ingredients collected through crowd-sourcing.
 
 Not just khichdi to serve with curd, volunteers will also be preparing and serving ladoos to all.
 
 “I have been following all initiatives of S2S from the first joint Shia-Sunni namaz held in 2015 to the langar held at Guru   and Ramzan’s Iftar feast at   gurudwara. What started out as Shia-Sunni amity has been expanded to all faiths in little time, and it is important to be part of such initiatives,” said a contributor to the event, Praveer Singh.
