KOCHI: The construction of flyover at   on national highway 66 will begin on Saturday. Public works minister G Sudhakaran will lay the foundation stone of the six-lane flyover, which is estimated to cost Rs 74.45 crore. 

 There would be two three-lane bridges with a length of 701 metre. The project is being funded by the state government from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).
 
 There will be 14 spans with 30 metres width each. There would be two slip roads to ensure smooth traffic to Aroor from Tripunithura and to Thevara from Aroor. Under the bridge there would be roundabout with proper traffic signal system. 
 
 The construction of the flyover will be completed within two years. Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) will be nodal agency for the construction of the flyover. 
 
 The work has been awarded to Mary Matha Constructions. Kundannoor Junction is the converging point of three national highways including Panvel-Kanyakumari NH -66, Kochi-Madurai NH-85 and   Island-Kundannoor NH-966 B. .
 
 According to the officials associated with the project, the construction of the flyover would require strict traffic regulations. Unlike in Vyttila junction, the road at Kundannoor doesn't have the width for the construction of a six-lane flyover. But, the National Highway Authority of India ( ) has already issued a common guideline for construction of flyovers across national highways. 
 
 According to the guidelines, only six lane flyovers can be constructed four -lane national highway. 
 
 Though, the project is being funded by the state government, it decided to construct the flyover according to the NHAI norms to avoid any technical snarls in the future. Unless there is a well-designed traffic regulation plan, the chances are high for traffic going haywire during the construction period.
