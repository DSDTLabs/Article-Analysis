PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:   Municipal Corporation is constructing a subway at College of Military Engineering ( ) chowk in Dapodi to ease flow of vehicles on the grade separator.

 Absence of signals will make it easier for military vehicles to enter and exit the CME premises.
 
 The 12-km-long stretch of Pune-Mumbai highway from Bhakti Shakti chowk in Nigdi to   Bridge in Dapodi has four concrete lanes known as grade separators. There is one bus rapid transit system (BRTS) lane on both sides of the grade separator. There are two to three lane service roads on both sides of the highway.
 
 Vehicles on the grade separator have to stop at traffic signals at three chowks -- Nashik phata, Phugewadi and CME chowk. The civic body had installed traffic signals at CME chowk after widening the highway to enable easy passage of military vehicles.
 
 Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson, BRTS cell, said, "The subway will enable vehicles to go straight to Harris bridge and further to   without stopping. Also vehicles entering Pimpri Chinchwad through Harris bridge in Dapodi can go till Phugewadi chowk unhindered using the grade separator.”
 
 He said that in case of emergency, military vehicles coming from Pune can be allowed to go to CME premises through the subway by stopping vehicular traffic on service road.
 
 "Normally vehicles with a maximum height of 4.5 meter can pass through the subways. Since the height of military vehicles is more, the CME chowk subway is being constructed in a way to make it possible for military vehicles with a height of 5.5 meter to pass through,” said Bhojane.
 
 There will be footpaths of 1.8 meter width on both sides of the subway to enable pedestrians to cross the subway safely.
 
 He said that the civic body has completed 40% construction of the subway and it is expected to be completed by December this year.
