AMRITSAR: Hundreds of agitated Sikhs and Hindus took to the streets and blocked major roads of Amritsar late Monday evening, alleging that cops pulled the beard of an elderly Sikh cartpuller and threw his turban on the ground.
However, police denied the allegations, saying they have a CCTV footage to show that the Sikh man himself had thrown his turban on ground.
 
 Former   (SGPC) member  , who joined   recently, along with several other persons sat on a dharna at   demanding an FIR against the cops. He said Mukhtiar Singh, a resident of Vallha, was turning his horse-drawn cart near   which had blocked traffic for a whi le. This irritated the police constable posted there and he allegedly slapped Mukhtiar, pulled his beard and threw his turban on ground.“We have gathered here as citizens of Amritsar and don't belong to any particular political party. All we need is justice for the poor man,“ he said.
 
 Alleging false allegations, additional deputy commissioner Gautam Singhal said, “The policemen didn't misbehave with the rehrawala. The constable stopped and objected to him for obstructing the traffic and in reaction, the rehrawala himself threw his turban on the ground. We have a CCTV footage to show the same.“ He said they had even shown the CCTV footage to the agitating persons but they were not ready to buy the argument.
 
 He informed that they (agitating groups) had also claimed to have a CCTV footage showing policemen misbehaving with the elderly person but despite repeated requests they had not been able to produce the footage.“However we are investigating the incident“ said Gautam.
