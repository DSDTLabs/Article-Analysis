Creativity was its best at the annual art fair organised by Faculty of Visual Arts, Banaras Hindu University. The three-day art fair, that showcased the work of both the teachers and students, was a connoisseur’s delight. The paintings, installations, show pieces, all had an artist’s touch. What made these artefacts special was that all were made with eco-friendly materials. Not only the work, even the stalls where the artworks were displayed had an artistic feel to it, some of them were in the form of an installation. A stall shaped as an eye, grabbed the maximum eyeballs.
The visitors enjoyed the scary house that was setup using trees. Neha Amrev, a visitor had a great time at the ghost house. The ambience not only gives an eerie feeling but also a perfect picture opportunity as well," she said.
 A photo booth that had Roman props to pose with, also turned out to be the most sought after place for the youngsters.
