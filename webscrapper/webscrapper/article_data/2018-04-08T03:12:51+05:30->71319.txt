NAVI MUMBAI: Forest officials at the   in Panvel taluka have urged the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) to realign all the high voltage power transmission lines within the forest through a safe underground passage, since it is injuring and killing wildlife, such as monkeys.

 The range forest official (RFO) at Karnala, Pradeep Chavan, told TOI, “It's been over three months that we have been requesting the   division of MSEDCL to take all the overhead live wires underground, as many   are either getting injured or dying due to electric shocks by touching these cables, which are close to the treetops inside the forest. So far, not much has been done in this regard.”
 
 The RFO added that in the past two years at least 25 monkeys have died after oming in contact with the cables.
 
 Panvel based activist  , said, “I had recently visited the bird sanctuary and was saddened to notice that several monkeys were also grievously injured, besides the 25 fatalities. MSEDCL must revamp the power distribution cables urgently so that none of the wild animals are affected.”
 
  Senior MSEDCL executive engineer at Bhingari circle, V Phunde said, “I will ask my staff to check the situation on ground at   and ensure that the work is carried out on a war footing so that the animals are not affected in the forest area.”
