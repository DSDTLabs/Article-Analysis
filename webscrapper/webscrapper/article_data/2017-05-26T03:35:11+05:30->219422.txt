GHAZIABAD: Nearly 200 shanties were razed on Thursday in an anti-encroachment drive carried out by GDA on a 1,600 square metre plot near   in  . This was the fourth attempt by the civic agency in three years to remove the encroachments in the area.

 “The drive, which began around noon, lasted nearly three hours in which 200-odd shanties were razed and close to 500 encroachers evicted,” said Dayanand Prasad, officer on special duty, GDA.
 
 “The drive was carried out in the presence of officials from GDA and the district administration in which a PAC battalion and cops from Indirapuram and Khoda police station were pressed into service,” he said.
 
 In October 2015, the Allahabad high court had ordered GDA to clear the encroachments in the area following a petition filed by   (KARWA). The next hearing in the case is scheduled in the high court on May 29.
 
 Claiming that the drive was just another attempt by the GDA to hoodwink the court, KARWA president Vinay Mittal, said, “This is the fourth occasion GDA has carried out the drive on the same piece of land in the last three years and on all occasions, the action has been taken just days before the matter was scheduled for hearing in the high court.”
 
 “We had filed the petition in the court to get rid of the slum dwellers as they are engaged in drug peddling, prostitution, and other such anti-social activities. After every drive, encroachers return to reclaim the land,” Mittal said.
 
 “I fail to understand why GDA does not barricade the land and deploy guards here,” he said. Referring to Mittal’s remark, Prasad said, “The land is barricaded but it is not possible for us to post guards all the time, so we are forced to carry out drives from time to time. Also, GDA intends to sell this piece of land and preparations are under way for an auction. It’s a matter of time before the land is sold off to private parties and the problem ceases to exist automatically.”
