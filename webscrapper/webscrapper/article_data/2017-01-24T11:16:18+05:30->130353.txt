GOA: BJP national president   on Monday further heightened the prevailing suspense over defence minister  's role in state politics by stating that the next government in Goa would function under Parrikar's leadership “wherever he may be“. Addressing the party's election campaign rally in Vasco, Shah said: “Goa has given a big asset to the country in Parrikar. He is a jewel in Prime Minister  's cabinet. There is a huge demand for Parrikar in Delhi and also here in Goa.The people of Goa demand that we should send Parrikar back to Goa. Whether he returns to Goa or continues to remain at the Centre will be decided only after the elections. But I want to say one thing, wherever Parrikar may be, the government in Goa will be under his leadership. Goans should be assured of that.“

 The remarks assume significance in the wake of in tense speculation in Goa whether Parrikar would return as the state's CM after the polls, particularly following a recent statement by Union minister   that the next Goa chief minister “can either be from among the elected representatives or we can even send (someone) from the Centre“.
 
 Addressing another rally in Margao, Shah promised to make Goa a model state and showcase it to the globe if the party is re-elected with a twothirds majority in the February 4 assembly elections.
 
 “Goa gave us a simple majority of 21seats in the last assembly elections. Give us a two-thirds majority this time, and I promise to make Goa a model state...In terms of infrastructure development, we want to place Goa in the numero uno place in the whole of Asia,“ he said.
