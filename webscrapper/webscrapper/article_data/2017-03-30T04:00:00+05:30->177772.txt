Vadodara: The Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) will be converting land along the Vishwamitri river as a riverfront development zone. The land presently is under different zones under the development plan and procedures will have to be conducted for the conversion.

 The ball for the riverfront development zone was set rolling after the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that is eyeing to develop the Vishwamitri riverfront had raised the issue with VUDA. The VMC is eyeing town planning schemes along both the banks of Vishwamitri. A similar town planning scheme was suggested in the VUDA jurisdiction towards the north and south of the city.
 
 According to VUDA, the river has Virod, Dumad, Koyali, Vemali, Dena and Harni village lands towards the north of the city. In the southern direction, the lands of Kalali, Talsat, Chapad, Khalipur, Maretha, Chansad and Karali villages are located. VUDA plans to have the riverfront scheme up to 600meters on either side of the river.
 
 While VUDA is keen to have the riverfront, it will have to get the land on either side of the river to be converted to the riverfront development zone. Presently, the land is under different zones like agriculture and residential zones. For the zone conversion, VUDA will have to send a proposal to the state government and seek its nod. The issue will be taken up in the board meeting of VUDA on Thursday.
 
 Sources said that besides the zone conversion, VUDA will also be getting a feasibility report prepared for the riverfront development scheme. For this, a contour survey and hydrology survey will also be prepared conducted.
 
 Like VUDA, the VMC is also eyeing town planning schemes on both the banks of the Vishwamitri river. It has already begun work on projects to ensure that drainage water does not enter the river.
