LUCKNOW: Unfazed by a raging family feud and a widening rift in the Samajwadi Party, chief minister   is giving finishing touches to his ‘development-oriented’ manifesto for the forthcoming assembly  . The manifesto, say highly placed sources, promises three new greenfield expressways covering more than a dozen districts at a cost of Rs 60,000 crore. Theses expressways would cover over 1,000 km in the state, including Bundelkhand.

 “In the past five years, Akhilesh has been emphasizing on road connectivity and giving high speed to agricultural activities and trade. In the manifesto which is being prepared under his supervision, these three prestigious expressways find a prominent place,” says a source close to the CM. Akhilesh has already inaugurated India’s longest expressway from Agra to Lucknow and laid the foundation stone for another expressway from Lucknow to Ghazipur up to Bihar borders.
 
 One of the expressways proposed in the manifesto is 552-km long, covering 14 districts of Bundelkhand. To be constructed with a budget of Rs 33,120 crore, it gives credence to the speculation that Akhilesh is planning to contest from the region. The CM had a meeting with the UPEIDA chief executive officer   two days back to finalise the details of the expressways. “The CM is going to seek votes on his development agenda,” says the source.
 
 Apart from the Bundelkhand expressway, the two others which have been finalized are 303-km Bijnor-Moradabad-Fatehgarh Expressway to be constricted at a cost of Rs 18,180 crore and 148-km Greater Noida-Muzaffarnagar Expressway which has a budget of Rs 8,520 crore.
 
 When contacted by TOI, Sehgal confirmed that three greenfield expressways had been finalized and would be developed by the UPEIDA on the same model as Agra-Lucknow and Lucknow-Ghazipur. All the three new expressways follow the fundning and land-aqcuaition pattern of Agra-Lucknow expressway.
