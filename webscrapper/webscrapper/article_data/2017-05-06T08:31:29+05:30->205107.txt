Calangute: Continuing their   drinking in  , Calangute PI   said five more tourists were arrested on Friday. They were later released. 

 On Thursday, the Calangute police had arrested six tourists for consuming alcohol in public place and creating nuisance. This move comes in the wake of direction to Goa police to act against those caught drinking on beaches and other public places. In 2013, the state government has directed the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) not to allow anybody to step on the beach with alcohol or glass bottles. However, till last week, this decision had not been implemented..
