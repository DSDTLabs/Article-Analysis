SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Sunday said time had come to bid farewell to cap politics in the state. Stating that he saw caps as an inseparable part of   culture and not as a symbol of regional divide of upper and lower Himachal as was considered during the Ccongress regime, the chief minister said he would not indulge in cap politics.

 In the state cap politics was started in the late 90s when BJP’s   became the chief minister for the first time. As Dhumal used to support maroon cap, his followers also started wearing maroon cap and it became the symbol of allegiance to BJP later. On the other hand, green Bushahari cap was tagged with the   and Virbhadra Singh, who from the beginning was wearing it and later his supporters also started wearing green caps to show their support for the Congress. 
 
 But with the defeat of Dhumal in the assembly elections and elevation of Jai Ram Thakur as chief minister, cap politics has taken a back seat in the state as he does not support maroon cap and does not hesitate from wearing a green one.
 
 Addressing a gathering at the Circuit House in Solan, Jai Ram said in the state political loyalties were denoted by the colour of caps. He said former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his supporters used to wear a green cap whereas BJP leaders and supporters adorned a maroon one. He said over the years these two colours had come to symbolise two different political alignments. He said he had stopped wearing the cap, thereby putting an end to cap politics.
 
 On the forthcoming budget session, he said after the budget session the Congress would itself see the working of the government. He said days of those serving an individual and not the government were over. He said his government had no place for vendetta but those who would be wrong while discharging their duties won’t be spared.
