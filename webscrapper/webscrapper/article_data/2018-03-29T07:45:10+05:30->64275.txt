CHANDIGARH: The   assembly cleared the way for 10 Bills — including a levy of development tax of Rs 200 a month and a ban on hooka bars — on the last of the budget session on Wednesday. 

 The Punjab Laws (Special Provisions for Regulation of Unauthorized Colonies) Bill, 2018, to make special provisions for better planning and regulating the development of unauthorized colonies, plots and buildings was also given a go-ahead by the assembly. The CM also moved The Punjab Transparency and Accountability in Delivery of Public Service Bill, 2018, and it got the assembly’s nod.
 
 Amarinder then moved the Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill, 2018, to replace the Punjab Police (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018. The Bill is aimed at establishing a ‘special operations group’ capable of countering and neutralising those indulging in crimes. The special operations group will have police personnel with world-class training and the highest degree of commitment to counter threats to public safety and security, the Bill envisages. 
 
 The Bill also calls for segregation of investigation wing of police from law and order machinery, and is aimed at encouraging professionalism and specialisation in the force.
 
 Parliamentary affairs minister   moved the Bill for prohibition of hookah/sheesha bars in Punjab, while public works department minister   moved the   and   (Amendment) Bill, 2018. Earlier, social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot withdrew   for Scheduled Castes (Amendment) Bill.
 
 Brahm Mohindra moved the Salaries and Allowances of Deputy Ministers, Punjab (Amendment) Bill, 2018; and the East Punjab Ministers’ Salaries, (Amendment) Bill, 2018, by which now the income tax of chief minister, other ministers and leader of opposition would be paid by themselves from March 2018.
