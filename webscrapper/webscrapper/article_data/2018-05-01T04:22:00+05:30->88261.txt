Vadodara: Three senior citizens from Karamsad have begun a fast unto death demanding a special status for the place where Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel grew up. 

 Activists in Karamsad have been raising the demand for over two decades now. They have now given a bandh call in the town for Tuesday.
 
 Sardar Patel was born in Nadiad but had spent a few years studying in Karamsad. The town had a special place in Sardar’s heart. Apart from his school, a memorial dedicated to him is also located here.
 
 Activists who have raised the demand for a special status for the town said that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pressed for the inclusion of the town in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) when he was the chief minister. But this did not materialise. “The demand has been gaining momentum since then. Representations were made to the local MLAs and MPs. The issue was taken up with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) too. The PMO wrote to the state government regarding the demand and it assured to do the needful in a letter around 2015. There has been no movement on this front after that,” said Rashesh Patel of the Sardar Pate Hitrakshak Samiti.
 
 Patel pointed out that the town had given a lot to the state by giving land for Vallabh Vidyanagar and other purposes. He pointed out that one of the major triggers for the agitation was a plan to make Anand a municipal corporation. “If Karamsad becomes a part of the municipal corporation, its identity will be lost,” said Rashesh. Those on fast include Jagdish Patel, Bipin Patel and Mahendra Patel.
