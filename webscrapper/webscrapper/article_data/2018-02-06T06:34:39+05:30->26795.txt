LUCKNOW: Fraudsters can come in any form. Over the past few months, about half a dozen cases have been reported in the city in which innocents have been duped by miscreants posing as policemen and sometimes even donning the 'khaki'.

 The first such incident was reported in August 2017. 
 
  
  
 
 In the most recent case, on Sunday, bike-borne miscreants posing as policemen duped an elderly woman outside her apartment on the busy   near Annexe. 
 
 Senior police officials say that a gang is on the prowl in the city since August.
 
  They con people of ornaments, cash and expensive gadgets. 
 
 The gang members have struck in every part of the city including Aashiana, Indiranagar,  , Hussainganj and Madiaon. A police team has been constituted by the crime branch to track the miscreants.
 
 SHO (Krishnanagar)   explained the modus-operandi of the gang.
 
 He said they dupe people by stating that women wearing   ornaments are not allowed to pass on a certain stretch as per a new regulation of the government. They then ask them to remove the jewellery and hand it over to 'bade sahab' for "packing". The jewellery is then "packed" in a handkerchief belonging to the gang. In the process, it is replaced with another handkerchief containing artificial jewellery. People believe them as they pose as policemen. To further intimidate people, the fraudsters say that "criminals are on the prowl and have robbed and killed a woman in the vicinity a few hours ago". 
 
 Sometimes, they frisk innocents in the name of "possessing fake currency" and slip away money from them.
 
 Efforts are on to nab the gang, police said. 
 
 A team has been made by police teams of three stations, said   Deepak  . "We will also check CCTV footage from the spots of crime and then get their sketches made," said Kumar.
