AHMEDABAD: Saptak audiences make a ritual request to  , the Mewati Gharana divinity. They want him to sing “Mata Kalika”, composed by  , a Sanand royal, who was Pandit Jasraj’s guru. Panditji clarifies with that verse — set to Raga Adana — the vulnerabilities of life, as well as the uniquely human defiance of despair evidenced by our search for meaning and purpose through art. While delivering that raga, Panditji’s voice stoically elaborates the pain that life is heir to. And then it dances as if it has recognized the landmarks leading to grace.

  On Friday, Panditji’s voice was heard on the Saptak stage, carrying the familiar solemnity and benediction. But the voice came in a video message, in which Panditji expressed regret that waves of coughing had forced him to skip a Saptak season. “Bapuji is tech-savvy and uses FaceTime to even teach music,” Durga Jasraj, Panditji’s daughter, told TOI. “That is an important aspect of Bapuji’s personality, which keeps him young at heart!” Panditji’s graciousness moved the audience. “Pandit Jasraj has not missed this event in years,” said Prafull Anubhai, the honorary director of Saptak archives. 
  
  
 Although rasikas were disappointed by Panditji’s absence this year, a classic Saptak moment may have given them an alleviating memory. “Tejendra Majumdar, a sarodiya, presented Raga Bageshree Kanada,” Anubhai said. “The rendition recalled for me the raga’s exposition many years ago at Saptak by   sahab.”   was a Maihar Gharana legend. So on Friday, with a video message and art, greatness was remembered.
