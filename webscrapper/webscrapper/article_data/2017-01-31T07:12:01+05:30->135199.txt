MANGALURU: Former KPCC president B   on Monday said that former CM SM Krishna’s resignation would adversely impact the party, not just in Karnataka, but across the nation. He called Krishna a seasoned politician who was extremely well-mannered. 

 Poojary, who has in the past attacked Siddaramaiah’s style of functioning, took another swipe at the CM, calling him a ‘bane’ of the party.
 
 "Siddaramaiah’s arrogance has crossed all limits. I have repeatedly been saying that Congress will not survive if he does not leave the party. It is not a Congress government in the state, it is a JD(S) government," said Poojary, in a veiled reference to Siddaramaiah’s past ties with the JD(S).
