PATNA: A dispute over an eight-kattha plot of land was the reason for the violent attack on the house of Tej Narayan Yadav in which his septuagenarian father Ramchandra Yadav (70) was killed, in Balha village under the Sadar police station area in Darbhanga district on Thursday night.

 Preliminary police probe into the attack has found that Tej, a hardened BJP supporter, runs a tea stall from the same disputed lot at the village’s Bhadwa Chowk, which he renamed as Narendra Modi Chowk a couple of years back. 
 
 At least a dozen youths riding six bikes and armed with hockey sticks, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons attacked Tej’s house on Thursday late night. Ramchandra received a fatal blow on his head, resulting in death during treatment.
 
 BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi in a tweet on Saturday also clarified that the killing had nothing to do with the renaming of the intersection.
 
 Union minister Giriraj Singh and BJP state president Nityanand Rai reached Balha and met the bereaved family on Saturday to condole the death of Ramchandra.
 
 Darbhanga SSP Satyaveer Singh said the deceased was in possession of the eight-kattha plot, on which one Kamlesh Yadav was also claiming ownership. 
 
 The SSP Singh said Kamlesh had lodged an FIR against Tej and others for assaulting him in August 2016. After investigation, police had chargesheeted Tej and the other accused.
 
 Later on December 26, 2016, Ramchandra lodged an FIR against Kamlesh and others, accusing them of murdering his son Phuldev Yadav (32), the SSP said and added police investigations, however, found that Phuldev had died due to prolonged illness.
 
 “The incident on Thursday is an outcome of an old and bitter rivalry between the two families,” the SSP said.
