NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has decided to extend the winter   of government and government-aided schools till January 19 after a forecast that the temperature might dip further in coming days. The schools were earlier scheduled to reopen on January 16.

 Schools run by NDMC, corporations and   have been asked to take a call on the extension. While some private schools have planned to extend their breaks, several others have decided to make no changes to the schedule.
 
 “The circular is for government schools. Plus we already had several vacations,” said Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales, Pusa Road.
 
 The   break, which started in the third week of December, for all   in Noida schools has been further extended till Sunday, January 15. Schools in neighbouring Ghaziabad however, reopened on Thursday as scheduled.
