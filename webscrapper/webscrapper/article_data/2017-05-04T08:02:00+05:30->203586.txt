Dharamshala: It has taken more than 70 years for India to understand the real motive of its neibhours, unlike an ordinary citizen, said NK Kalia, the septuagenarian father of Kargil martyr Saurbh Kalia whose body was mutilated by the Pakistan army during the 1999 war. Kalia also said that India should learn a lesson from Sri Lanka. “Sri Lanka is a smaller country but the way it has decimated LTTE is a lesson worth taking,” he said adding that terrorism in border areas should be dealt with firmly. Kalia’s comments come in the wake of two Indian soldiers who were mercilessly killed along the Line of Control by Pakistan.

 Saurabh and five other soldiers of the 4 Jat Regiment were captured by Pakistani forces on May 15, 1999 and their mutiliated bodies were returned to India. BJP president Amit Shah who is currently in the state said that the government will soon come out with a comprehensive policy on Kashmir. 
 
 But Kalia Senior said that the government should show more clarity and refrain from having a dual policy on Pakistan. “How do you deal with these back stabbers? This is not the first case of mutilation of soldiers,” questioned Kalia who was moving from pillar to post for 17 years to seek justice for his son. Kalia had moved the Supreme Court in 2012 seeking a direction to MEA to approach the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for appropriate action against the Pakistan army which killed his son in violation of 'Geneva Convention on treatment of war prisoners'.
 
 Elaborating on the stand of the Indian government, Kalia said: “I can bring the horse to the pond but can’t make it to drink water,” he said adding that it is left to the Indian government to take up the matter with the ICJ.
