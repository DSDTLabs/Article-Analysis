Chennai: In the country’s   capital, it is only natural that worries of most residents are about high blood sugar and other complications. In 2017, at least one in three Chennaiites who logged into online consultation platforms had diabetes-related queries.

 In 2015, sexual health topped the list of questions from Chennai’s netizens. Even today, a little more than a quarter of people ask about infertility and contraception.
 
 The latest report by online doctor consultation platform Lybrate Healthscape India analysed eight crore interactions across the country on its platform since January 2017.
 
 While 33% of Chennai residents had queries on diabetes, 27% asked about infertility and contraception and 24% wanted to know abot children and adolescent health. An almost equal number had conversations around Vitamin D and B12 deficiency and hypertension. 
 
 “People are getting concerned and aware about being psychologically healthy. They are reaching out to healthcare experts too,” said Lybrate founder-chief executive officer Saurabh Arora. The website asks people to register their phone numbers but does not insist on their real names.
 
 Across the country, although most people seem obsessed with questions on sexual health, the platform has seen an increase of 220% in vitamin deficiency, 215% in questions on respiratory health and 205% increase in diabetes. Incidents such as the Ryan Internationa School murder and blue whale challenges spurred many parents to ask questions about adolescent and child health. 
 
 Diabetologist Dr V Mohan said most people, including women, have become proactive about consultations and regular health checks. “Most patients are comfortable using health apps to monitor daily sugar and blood pressure levels. Increasingly, doctors too agree using the internet and mobiles is unavoidable though it cannot entirely replace physical consultations,” he said.
