Ponda: Sanvordem candidate of the Aam Aadmi Party Uday Gaunker has been forced to contest the election as an independent due to a mistake in filling his nomination form. Returning officer of Sanvordem Agnelo Fernandes, sitting at Dharbandora, said that since the candidate had fulfilled the necessary conditions for an independent candidate he could contest the elections as one.  “Since he left the name column in the Form B blank he could not claim to be a political party candidate. As his nomination was proposed by 10 electors which is mandatory for an independent, his nomination was accepted as an independent,” Fernandes said. The constituency has Ganesh Gaonkar as the BJP candidate, Deepak Prabhu Pawaskar as the MGP candidate, Shankar Kirlapalkar as the Congress candidate, and Uday Gaunker and Balkrishna Marathe as independents.
