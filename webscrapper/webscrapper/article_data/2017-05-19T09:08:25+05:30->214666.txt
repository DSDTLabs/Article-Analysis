BENGLURU: Borrowing ideas from the BJP and Congress, the JD(S) on Thursday announced two strategies to turn around the party's fortunes during the 2018 polls.

 JD(S) has decided to recreate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's successful `chai pe charcha', which propelled BJP to power in 2014. In the localised version, JD(S) will host `rotti and mudde pe charcha' in the state. Another idea is to run Namma Appaji canteens, named after JD(S) leader   and similar to the subsidised Karnataka state government's Indira canteens and  's Amma canteens for the urban poor.
 
 “Admittedly, the euphoria created by Modi's chai pe char cha cannot be ignored. We are keen to emulate the successful model by serving piping hot afternoon meals while debating the relevance of regional parties and the failures or successes of national parties,“ JD(S) deputy floor leader   told TOI.
 
 Datta said the programme will be called `Karnataka's pride: rotti and mudde pe charcha on regional parties' relevance' (Karnataka asmithe: rotti mathu mudde mele pradeshika pakshagala mele charche). The programme will take off from June, with the sessions to be held at the village, taluk and town levels. Local MLAs, leaders and JD(S) chiefs H D   and Deve Gowda will participate.
 
 “Anyone can participate.We expect it to be a debate and not jingoism. They can be for or against JD(S) and regional parties,“ said Datta. The gathering will have 50 people and mudde and rotti will be sponsored by local JD(S) leaders.
 
 In honour of his mentor Deve Gowda, JD(S) MLC and businessman T A Saravana has plans to set up canteens serving subsidized food similar to the Indira canteens in Karnataka.“The first of the Appaji canteens will be opened in Basavanagudi in a month.The canteen will operate between 8am and 3pm, and serve idli-vada and khali dosa at Rs 5 per plate. Lunch will cost Rs 10 per plate of variety rice and mudde with soppukalu saar,“ said Saravana.
