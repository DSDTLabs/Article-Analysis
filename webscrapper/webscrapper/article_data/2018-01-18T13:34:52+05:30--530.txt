BENGALURU: Pulling up the joint commissioner, BBMP, Mahadevapura zone, for entertaining a revision petition and initiating proceedings for cancellation of the khata of an apartment complex, the   high court on Wednesday directed the chief secretary and the   commissioner to seek a report for his action. The revision petition was submitted by  , who claimed to be the organizing secretary of the Karnataka Pradesh Mahila Congress.

 The Habitat Splendour Owners Association, Kundalahalli, near  , had challengedthecancellation of the khata. They had further contended that the BBMP joint commissioner was going ahead with the proceedings, despite a civil court injunction.
 
 “This is a very serious matter, where the powers conferred under Section 114-A of the act (Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976), are being continuously abused by the said joint commissioner without any application of mind to see whether the applicant before him has the locus standi or not,” Justice   observed, while directing the BBMP joint commissioner tosubmit a personal affidavit and also personally appear on January 31, 2018, the next dateof hearing.
 
 The court also stayed further proceedings in the case before the joint commissioner. “Prima-facie, it appears to this court that the joint commissioner has illegally and unnecessarily entertained these proceedings at the instance of a busybody like Ms Parvathi Reddy. She neither claims any interest in the said property nor apparently has any other interest in the matter, but is seeking the cancellation of khata in favour of the present petitioner members,” the court noted.
