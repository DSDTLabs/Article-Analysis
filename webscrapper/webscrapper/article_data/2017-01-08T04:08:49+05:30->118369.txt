 MUMBAI: Civic chief   wants the   to be brought down to 10 metric tonnes (MT) by the month-end and wants active participation from residents. Currently, 80 of the 675 MT waste, collected on daily basis, is plastic.

 “Plastic is harming nature and living beings on a large scale. Eliminating plastic is essential for a city aspiring to be smart. Starting Sunday, civic garden will be declared plastic-free zones,” said the civic chief.
 
 The administration has planned a mass drive, Operation Plastic Surgery, on Sunday. The event, graced by prominent personalities like Juhi Chawla and Shankar Mahadevan, will be flagged off from sector 28, Nerul.
 
 The drive will be conducted simultaneously across 425 spots in the city. Around 5,000 volunteers from Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari Prathisthan will be participating in the drive along with citizens,   staff and conservancy workers. “This is not a one day activity but it is a process to eliminate the use of plastic in our day to day life,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan
 
 During an awareness seminar held on Friday to explain the harm caused by plastic, the commissioner termed the waste as a economic crisis. “This industry is thriving on the principle of demand and supply and demand has to stop to end it. Legally NMMC is levying fines on those found using plastic below 50 microns but residents also need to take the lead,” said Mundhe. The waste collected on Sunday will be taken to the landfill site for making plastic pellets.
