JHUNJHUNU: Prime Minister   on Thursday redefined the acronym “PM” as “poshan mission” and said every time one hears the word the nutrition mission should come to mind.

 In  , Rajasthan, to launch the   ( ) Mission and the pan-India expansion of the Beti Bachaho Beti Padhao (BBBP) programme on Women’s Day, Modi also presented teddy bears to the daughters of 200 women chosen to meet him because they were mothers only to girls.
 
 “When someone says PM, be it to criticise or to compliment, it is the poshan (nutrition) mission that should come to your mind, and not  ,” the PM said. He also praised the district to improve sex ratio under the BBBP programme.
 
 “In the 18th century, when a girl was born people used to drown her in a big utensil filled with milk. But we are worse than even them. In those times, those people at least allowed girls to take birth. She could see the face of her mother and her mother could see her face. Today, we misuse technology and kill girls in the womb of the mother,” Modi said.
 
 “A jan andolan (public revolution) is needed to save the girl child and to improve nutrition levels among girls,” he said and urged mothers-inlaw to take the lead.
 
 Two hundred women from Jhunjhunu, all under 30 years of age and mothers only to girls, were proud that their daughters were the reason they were getting to meet the PM. Modi spent 10 minutes interacting with them and playing with the young girls. “I am so proud of my daughter and so glad I made this decision. It is because of her that PM chose to meet me. No son can give me what my daughter has given me today,” said  . whose daughter is 17 months old.
