NAGPUR: Despite several safety measures undertaken by MahaMetro to avert accidents, yet another one took place on early Saturday morning. Fortunately, no one was hurt. A   part fell down on a parked car crushing its rear side. The incident took place near Darodkar Square,  .

 A Metro spokesperson said that despite requests not to park cars near the construction site, a WagonR owner   had parked his vehicle in prohibited area. “The car had been parked at night and when we noticed it early in the morning there was no way to find the owner. Next time we will enforce parking restrictions more strictly,” he added.
 
 The ground support system (GSS) part of Metro viaduct was being lifted by a chain when the latter snapped at around 5.30am. The   came down crashing on the parked car damaging its rear side completely.
