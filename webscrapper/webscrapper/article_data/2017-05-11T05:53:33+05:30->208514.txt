KOLKATA: An  , who underwent a   at the  , went missing on the evening of May 4, a day before he was to be discharged. The   and Alipore cops have spoken to family members and the fellow officers of the patient, but are yet to find a lead. 

 Brajesh Kumar Shukla, 52, a junior warrant officer with IAF and posted in Jorhat, Assam, got admitted to Command Hospital on April 26 for treatment of eye diabetic retinopathy cataract. He underwent a surgery on May 2 and was to be discharged on May 5. But Shukla could not be traced a day before the scheduled release. “A ward boy was the last to see him around 5pm on May 4. A day earlier, he spoke to my mother about how the day had been,” said Brajesh’s elder son Tarun, who works with an IT firm in Bengaluru. 
 
 Brajesh’s younger son Arun is studying in an engineering college in Pune.
 
 Brajesh had moved to Jorhat this January. Since he had not been allotted family quarters, his wife Rekha was in Nagpur, his previous posting location. 
 
 “She is supposed to join father in June,” said Tarun. 
 
 What is curious about Brajesh’s disappearance is that his cellphone was left on his hospital bed. With the patient missing, hospital authorities discharged him in absentia and notified the IAF police. The matter was reported to Alipore PS the day after. On May 8, the case was reported to Lalbazar.
 
 “As of now, we are not suspecting any foul play. But his sudden disappearance has come as a shock to the family as he last spoke to them on May 3 and everything seemed fine. I have spoken to everyone conceivable, including other patients at Command Hospital, his colleagues, and even the commanding officers in Jorhat, but there have been no leads,” said Tarun.
 
 The CCTV footage at the hospital is being reviewed to check if Brajesh walked out alone or with a group.
