GUWAHATI:   CM Conrad K   on Sunday said the violence in   was not a communal clash between the Sikh and   communities but a small local incident that was hijacked by miscreants, who turned into a local land issue that has been on for 20-30 years. 

 
 "There is no communal angle to it. It was related to a particular locality and to a particular issue - a land issue that has been on for last 20 to 30 years. One small incident that took place in one locality became a spark for the whole thing," Sangma said.
 
 Sangma warned that the miscreants had been identified and his government would now act tough. "In the initial hours, our police exercised restraint so that no innocent person was affected. In the process, 30 of our policemen were seriously injured. Now that we know who are the people creating trouble, I have instructed the police to take stern action."
 
 Union minister Kiren Rijiju, too, denied any damage to a gurdwara or other institutions belonging to the Sikh community in Meghalaya.
 
 On Sunday, local Sikh leaders in Shillong denied reports of attack on a gurdwara. "There was no attack on us by a section of local community on Saturday night and the administration lifted the curfew till 3pm," Shillong-based Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar general secretary Gujit Singh told TOI.
