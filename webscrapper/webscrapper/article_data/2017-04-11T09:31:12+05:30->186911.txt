CHENNAI: After almost half a century of domination by Dravidian parties —   and AIADMK— in   that kept national parties at bay, shrill voices of apprehension now emerge stating that the   and BJP-led central government is trying to control the outcome of things unfolding in the state.
 
  “The cancellation of bypoll is a planned drama …They knew we were going to win this election ( ) and BJP is also aware that their party will not even regain the deposit (money paid to election commission ahead of polls), which is why I presume they have done this,”   (Amma) party deputy general secretary and   candidate TTV Dhinakaran told reporters on Monday when asked for his reaction to Election Commission’s announcement deferring bypolls in the key constituency.
  
  The RK Nagar seat was vacated following the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The Election Commission late on Sunday night countermanded the April 12 bypoll, saying the electoral process has been "seriously vitiated" by parties through use of money power.
  
  An EC statement had said, “The Commission is fully satisfied that the current electoral process...in Tamil Nadu has been seriously vitiated on account of unlawful activities of the candidates and political parties and their workers by bribing the electors and unlawfully inducing them by offering money and other gifts of consumable items to woo them in their favour.”
