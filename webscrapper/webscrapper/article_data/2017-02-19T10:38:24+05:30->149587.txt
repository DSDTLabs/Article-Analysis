 Kanzaniya was spotted near the check-in area for flight AI 853, bound for Pune at 6.45pm.

 “Kanzaniya said he had edited the ticket with the same PNR no as his girlfriend so he could enter inside the airport area,” said a CISF officer.
 
 “We are getting a lot of cases these days where people are using fake tickets to drop relatives inside or to meet someone. The tickets usually have fake PNR numbers or are old tickets," said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI airport).
