 "She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. She'll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she's made me a more empathetic person ," 
 



  The Canadian star said his actress wife encouraged him to open up about his past and his "fractured relationship" with his father James.  "I had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didn't want to remember. She made me remember the good times."
