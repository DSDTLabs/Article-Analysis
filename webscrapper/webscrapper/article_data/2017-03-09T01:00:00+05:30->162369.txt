While   is known to be celebrated with pomp and vigour,   has come out with a   number, which offers a different take on the festival. What’s more, the soothing track, 'Holi Hamraa Na Bhaawe', also pays tribute to the soldiers who stay away from their families, in the line of duty. The actress features in a de-glam avatar in the song, as it’s about a woman who’s oblivious to the Holi celebration around her as she misses her beloved, a soldier posted on duty.

 When asked about the song, Neetu revealed, “It’s a heart-rending story which shows how not everyone gets an opportunity to celebrate with their loved ones. The soldiers rarely get to celebrate festivals with their friends and family.”
