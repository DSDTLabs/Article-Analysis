If you want to keep smiling, you need to clean your mind for which crying at least once in month is a must. Crying is an emotional act which cleanses your mind of sad memories. You begin to feel lighter after you have cried.”

 “Crying is a process which helps remove the dirt from the tiniest part of your mind. Like you clean your house regularly, you also need to clean your mind which can be done by crying,” he added. 
 
 “Surat city has a number of laughter clubs and a crying club too. A merger of the two will provide an avenue to those looking to cleanse the mind of the dirt through crying so that they can always keep smiling,”  , a regular at the laughing and crying club in the city, said.
