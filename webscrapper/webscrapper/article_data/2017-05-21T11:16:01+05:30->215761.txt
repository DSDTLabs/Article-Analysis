CHENNAI: A group of residents, who are protesting that an unauthorised building is coming up at Kamarajapuram Government Middle School ( ), have stationed in front the premises demanding action against the construction. 

 The protesters, who were on the ground for a second day in a row on Saturday, alleged that the new construction, which are quarters for the police department has no permit to come up in front of the school, impeding room for any extension of the school. They produce an   filed last year, which indicates that the land has not been allotted to any department. 
 
 “There are 5 lakh residents and not enough government schools in the Ambattur zone. Currently there is only one girls higher secondary school and none for boys. The corporation should ensure that the land is allotted to the construction of a higher secondary school and an inquiry should be conducted about the building that is coming up in the place,” said K Bharathi, an advocate and protester. 
 
 A foundation has been laid and pillars are being erected at the moment in the 2-acre land in front of the school. But Corporation officials, when contacted, said that the schools in the extended areas are still under the erstwhile district administrations and a government proposal to transfer them to the school department of   is pending.
 
 “The issue is not under our scope. Those protesting want the land to be transferred to us so that we can construct a higher secondary school, but that decision rests on the government,” said a senior corporation official.
