NEW DELHI: A   about to flee after looting a Patanjali store in Sarai Rohilla was busted in a dramatic fashion by personnel of a PCR van. 

 The incident occurred on Saturday when policemen on patrol on Rohtak Road spotted a vehicle near a store. They got suspicious and raised an alarm. At this, five or six men ran out of the shop, boarded the Maruti Esteem and tried to drive off. Police suspected that they were up to something fishy. The staff swung into action and rammed the car with their vehicle, rendering it out of action. “Seeing that they were surrounded, the youths got off and tried to run off. One of them was overpowered while the rest managed to scoot,” said DCP (PCR) Monika Bhardwaj. 
 
 The arrested man was identified as Vinit, a resident of Shahbad Dairy. Police recovered a watch, a cellphone, two bags of cigarettes and Rs 4,500 cash. 
 
 On interrogation, Vinit said he and his gang had stolen these items from another shop prior to this burglary. An iron rod used by the burglars to break open the shutter of the shop was also seized from the car. 
 
 The car was stolen from Sultanpuri, Vinit said. The PCR staff then informed Sarai Rohilla police station and handed the   to them. 
 
 “The entire incident was captured by a CCTV camera installed in an adjoining shop. The footage went viral on social media, and the police action was appreciated by the public. The PCR personnel have been recommended for awards,” Bhardwaj said. 
 
 A case of trespassing was registered.
