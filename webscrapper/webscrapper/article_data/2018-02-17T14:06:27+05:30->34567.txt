Tirupur: The process of providing artificial limbs to disabled people, who took part in the recent medical assessment camps organized in the district by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, is getting delayed.

 Sources in the Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) said the ministry was yet to sanction funds for procuring the limbs.
 
 The ministry conducts the medical assessment camps across the country in coordination with the respective state governments. The   government has conducted more than 4,500 camps so far. 
 
 In  , the ministry was conducting the camps with the help of a few NGOs, including Samadrishti and Kshamata Vikas Evam Anusandhan Mandal ( ), and the district administration.
 
 In last November, five mega medical assessment camps were held in five places in five days in Tirupur district. As many as 2,516 disabled people took part in the camps and the government doctors assessed their disability. The district disabled welfare department recommended to provide artificial limbs ranging from knee calipers to cerebral palsy chair.
 
 The ministry had sanctioned funds to ALIMCO, the public sector undertaking, to supply artificial limbs and other aids to the beneficiaries of the similar camps held during the same time in   and   districts. For the beneficiaries in Tirupur, it is getting delayed. 
 
 “We heard that the ministry was yet to provide funds to ALIMCO but we hope that it may be processed soon,” said G Jagadeesan, Tirupur district disabled rehabilitation officer.
 
  “The delay may be due to the involvement of a huge amount in the mega camps in Tirupur, for which the ministry should sanction around Rs 2.5 crore. In case of Nagapattinam and Permabalur districts, the funds needed were lesser.”
