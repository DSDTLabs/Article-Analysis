KOCHI: The crime branch (CB) wing of the police claimed before the   that no   put pressure on the police or civic authorities to permit   at Puttingal Devil Temple, Kollam in March last year. The accident that occurred during fireworks display had claimed over 100 lives and left over 350 injured. 

 CB's claim that no political leaders exerted undue influence in permitting the fireworks was informed to the high court through an affidavit filed by HHW-I superintendent G Sreedharan. The affidavit was in response to the court's query as to how the fireworks were held despite the district collector declining permission for the same. The court had also asked CB to probe as to how the fireworks were allowed to continue despite a small-scale incident occurring hours before the tragedy.
 
 As per the affidavit, police issued an NOC on a second application as the fireworks display was a traditional belief of the community and the recommendation made to the district administration was only for a ritualistic display.
 
 Political leaders such as former MP Peethambara Kurup, MLA GS Jayalal, and Congress leader Sooranad Rajasekharan had contacted police officers for the purpose of issuing NOC for the fireworks but they dropped their attempts when they were told that the temple authorities are planning to conduct competitive fireworks, CB claimed in the report given to the court.
 
 "That on investigation, it was revealed that the temple committee members had wanted to conduct the fireworks display competition at any cost as they were unable to stop it since it had been a traditional festival event of the temple and the community. Further there is a belief that the temple should not be closed after festival without conducting the fireworks display at night of 'Meena Bharani," stated the CB's affidavit.
 
 There was no intervention by any extra-constitutional power centres and hence no such persons are arrayed as accused, the report said.
