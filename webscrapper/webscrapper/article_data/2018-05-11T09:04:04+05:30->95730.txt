BATHINDA: On the call of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee ( ), farmers on Thursday held protests at district headquarters across Punjab for complete debt waiver and implementation of   recommendations about fixing minimum support price (MSP) by calculating all expenses incurred on crops.

 The protests were dedicated to 160th anniversary of the First War of Independence in 1857. Memorandums in the names of   chairman and Lok Sabha speaker demanding special session of the   to pass private member bills—‘Farmers Freedom from Indebtedness Bill 2018’ and ‘Farmers’ Right to Guaranteed Remunerative Minimum Support Price for Agricultural Commodities Bill 2018’—were handed over to the officials.
 
 Members of farmer outfits   (Ekta Dakaunda), Krantikari Kisan Union, Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, Kirti Kisan Union and Punjab Kisan Union took part in the protest.
 
 “A signature campaign had been conducted in rural areas to tell that these bills have been prepared by farmers of the country, and Parliament should take up these. Some political parties in the NDA have also supported the bills on April 25 and they have been presented these to the parliament secretariat as private members’ bills,” said AIKSCC working group member and BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) organising secretary Darshan Pal.
 
 He said the first bills obligate the government to waive all loans of peasants, including landless peasants and agricultural workers. “The second bill is for government to regulate and decrease cost price of farm inputs, including diesel, seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, machinery and equipment, to set up a cost and prices commission in order to assess all the cost of production which shall include computing of paid up costs, family labour, rent of land, depreciation of capital inputs, interest and insurance costs and to ensure through public and private purchasing agencies that the farmers get a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) plus 50% profit,” said Darshan.
