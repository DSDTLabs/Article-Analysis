Gurgaon: Residents of sectors 21 and 22 have been facing acute   for the last one week, leaving them at the mercy of private tankers.

 “We were supplied water only twice in the last one week. We are forced to pay a high amount ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 for a water tanker. Despite all facilities at my house, I have been suffering due to lack of basic amenities,” said Navita Bhatti, a resident of Sector 22. 
 
 According to RWA members, there are more than 200 households that are not getting enough water for their daily needs. Col. Omed Singh, president of RWA, said, “Water crisis is an ongoing problem in the sector. However, as the heat is rising and water supply continues to be very low, the problem has become severe. Despite repeated complaints to the authorities, there has been no respite.” 
 
 According to the residents, water theft by a few illegal colonies is adding to their woes. 
 
 “As the pipeline passes through many unauthorised colonies, water theft is very common in the area. As a result supply water does reach houses situated at the tail-end of the pipeline,” said Malik Chand, another resident. 
 
 The residents demanded the authorities to install new water pipelines, increase storage capacity, keep a check on water theft and set up more bore wells.
 
 However, their demands have fallen on deaf ears. “We have been receiving a few complaints from these sectors. However, water has been supplied to the residents for the last two days,” said an MCG official.
