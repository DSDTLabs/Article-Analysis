PATNA: Chief minister (CM)   on Saturday interacted with 50-member state JD(U) team from Madhya Pradesh (MP) and asked them to revive the state unit by involving the socialists in party activities, as they had become inactive over the past few decades for want of alternatives.

 A 50-member team of the MP JD(U) led by the party’s state chief   met Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, at the JD(U) headquarters here, said MP JD(U) vice-president  .
 
 The MP JD(U) team solicited Nitish’s visit to their state, but was told that it would be finalised in due course. “Our party president would visit MP to further energise the state unit, but the date has not been finalised yet,” Sharma said, adding MP would have assembly elections late next year.
 
 During his one-and-a-half-hour interaction with the MP JD(U) team, Nitish asked them to expand the party by strengthening district units and giving entry to the old and new, including the socialists. He suggested them to take up public issues, including ban on liquor sale.
