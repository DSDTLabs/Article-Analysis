ABBA, the   pop group, took to Instagram and wrote, "The decision to go ahead with the exciting   avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and that we only had been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience! It resulted in two new songs and one of them "I still have faith in you" will be performed by our digital selves in a TV special produced by NBC and the BBC aimed for broadcasting in December. We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good."
A fan tweeted a GIF and wrote, "When you find out #ABBA are reuniting."
 
 
  Another fan wrote, "#BREAKING: ABBA is reuniting after 35-year hiatus; new songs announced."
