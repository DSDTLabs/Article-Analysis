NEW DELHI: Shiromani   ( ) on Thursday made two unsuccessful attempts to get its petition, which sought to stall release of the film ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’, listed for hearing in the Supreme Court. 

 SGPC counsel Satinder S Gulati pleaded with a bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y  , which had on Tuesday allowed the release of the film, that the statutory religious body has objection to any actor playing the role of either the Sikh Guru or his family members. The bench said, “SGPC may be a statutory body but that cannot permit it to attack a certificate for screening granted by the CBFC.” This came even as the Akal Takht on Thursday excommunicated the producer   from Sikh Panth.
