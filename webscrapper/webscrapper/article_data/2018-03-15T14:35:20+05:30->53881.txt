MYSURU: As part of its efforts to project the former chief minister, and state president of the BJP   as a farmer leader, members of the party’s farmer wing on Wednesday announced that they would visit the homes of ryots and collect a fistful of grains to garner their support for the party.

 State secretary of the   Raitha Morcha Mallappa Gowda said, “In order to give the   who feed the nation their due, and to bring back Yeddyurappa to power, we want to carry out this grain collection drive in the district.”
 
 Gowda added, “This is Yeddyurappa’s pet project. We must ensure the success of this initiative at the booth level. Party workers must be involved in this drive, and make it a success.”
 
 Elaborating on the plan, Gowda said, “We will visit the homes of at least 20 farmers at the booth level, and cover a minimum of 50 houses in every village. Similarly, we want to call on 300 houses in every gram panchayat, and cover 10,000 homes in each constituency.”
 
 He said that the chief objective was to take farmers into confidence, and that a convention would be organised at the constituency level, where food prepared from the grains collected from the farmers will be distributed.
 
 Dubbing the Congress government in the state ‘anti-farmer’, Gowda said, “As many as 3,000 farmers have committed suicide. Farmer should be given hope. If the BJP comes to power, it will resolve all problems of the farming community.”
 
 District BJP chief and former minister M Shivanna and Raitha Morcha district chief Prasanna Kumar were present.
