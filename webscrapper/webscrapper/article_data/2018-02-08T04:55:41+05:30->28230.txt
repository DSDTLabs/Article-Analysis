AMBERNATH: A probe has started against a school here after parents of a class six student, who had jumped from its second floor, complained to police that she had tried to end her life after harassment by teachers over friendship with a boy.

 The 12-year-old girl had initially said she had slipped and fallen, but during counselling by doctors in hospital revealed that she was upset with her teachers over the harassment and had tried to take her life.
 
 When the family approached the school, they were told action would be taken against the teachers who harassed her. But no action was taken, so the parents approached   police on Wednesday. The school claims the girl slipped and fell, and has denied harassment.
 
 The complaint said that on January 16, two teachers taunted the girl in a classroom full of students for being "close" to a boy from another class. Later, another teacher also took a dig at her over her alleged "affair" in a school corridor.
 
 "The teachers not only harassed me by making false allegations about I having an affair with a boy who is just a friend but they also asked my dance teacher not to include me in the rehearsal for the school function. This depressed me and I decided to end my life," the girl told TOI on Wednesday. Upset, she cried in her class room, and then went up to the second floor and jumped on January 17.
 
 Her father approached the Ambernath police to lodge an FIR, but the cops accepted only an application. "A probe is on," said Balkrishna Wagh, senior inspector of Ambernath police station, confirming a complaint against the teachers.
