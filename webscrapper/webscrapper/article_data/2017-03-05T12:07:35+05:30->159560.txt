NAGPUR: While strongly refuting charges labelled by NU, Bank of India came out with a clarification accusing the  , despite the fact that it was ready to refund Rs32 lakh. 

 “We advised NU to issue an indemnity letter in the prescribed format. But NU denied and insisted on the format stipulated by them which was not acceptable to the  . It was the reason the refund was delayed and amount couldn’t be given back, for which bank is not responsible at all,” a communique from the bank said.
 
 The BOI passed buck on Canara Bank’s Yavatmal branch from where the amount was siphoned off stating that latter’s account was non-KYC compliant. “In spite of this, BOI is discharge of its responsibility and considering NU’s reputation, acceded to its request to refund Rs32 lakhs, But it will be subject to the execution of indemnity letter in a format prescribed by the bank, which stipulated refund in case police investigation brings out account holder or staff involvement in the matter,” the release added.
 
 It added that the forensic investigation done in this regard also shows that the signature on the fake cheque matches with the signature of authorized signatories. BOI had given written instruction to the   to investigate into the matter since payment against the   was done at their end and also to refund the amount to BOI immediately.
 
 “The investigation is going on and the main culprit will be identified only after its completion. We’ve made it clear to NU regularly that they need to issue an indemnity letter in the prescribed format only for getting refund. However, NU is not paying the heed and delaying the matter and also tarnishing the BOI’s image by making false propaganda against the bank which its management strongly refuted,” the release added.
