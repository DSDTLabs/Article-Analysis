KOLHAPUR: There is a visible slump in the sugar bowl of the state and it has nothing to do with demonetisation. 

 Many sugar factories in   have been forced to shut operations within three months of the commencement of the crushing season because of low sugarcane cultivation in the region in 2015-16 due to poor monsoon. 
 
 Almost 18 (44%) of the 41 sugar factories in Kolhapur, Satara and   districts that had begun crushing operations in mid-November 2016 have already closed down. Of these, 11 factories were in Kolhapur district and eight in Satara. 
 
 Normally, crushing season lasts till months of April and May every year. But officials said the crushing season could end by February this year. 
 
 As per state figures, sugar cane was cultivated over a total of 6.33 lakh hectare. The expected sugarcane production will be 493 lakh tonne as against 750 lakh tonne reported in 2015-16. This year's sugar production is expected to dip to one of the lowest recorded in recent years. 
 
 The Kolhapur district alone is set to lose 4.8 lakh tonne sugarcane production as many areas did not receive water from wells, borewells or lakes. Hence, farmers could not cultivate sugarcane from December to March, which is the regular cultivation period.
