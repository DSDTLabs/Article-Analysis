 Trichy: Two men landed in police custody after they tried to rob a woman by posing as policemen, in Manapparai on Saturday. 
 
 It was around 11 am on Saturday when Annathai, 53, of Edatheru in Manapparai, was walking home after finishing her cleaning work at a private bank on Kovilpatti Road in the town. Two motorcycle-borne men, believed to be in their 40s, intercepted her and introduced themselves as policemen. They told her that the area was prone to chain-snatching incidents and advised her to keep her gold chain in a safe place. Taking heed of their advice, Annathai removed the chain from her neck and gave it to them to wrap it in a paper. 
 
 However, as soon as they got the chain, the duo tried to escape from the spot. The woman raised alarm on which a few passers-by blocked the way of the miscreants. The duo then left the bike and started sprinting. People chased them for about 2km before catching one of the accused.
 
 He was handed over to the Manapparai police who quizzed him. The police said that they have caught the second person too. However, they refused to divulge their identity. Sources said that the offenders would be put thorough interrogation not only in connection with todayâ€™s case but also about the similar types of cases that occurred in Trichy city. 
 
 It may be recalled that a 64-year-old woman fell prey to the trick played out by a couple of men posing as policemen and lost her four-sovereign gold ornaments at Srirangam in Trichy on September 11.
