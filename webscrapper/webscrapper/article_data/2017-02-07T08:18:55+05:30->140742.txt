HYDERABAD: To expedite development of Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), the   government initiated the process of denotifying three important   (SEZ) in the state. 

 Two of them come under the Achutapuram area of Visakhapatnam district while the third is located in Naidupet area of Nellore. For denotification to take effect, the Centre has to clear the proposal sent by the state government to convert SEZs into spaces for Domestic Traffic Area (DPA) which will speed up development of VCIC. TDP government decided to free SEZs as these contain huge chunks of land that have remained unused as such special zones come with riders. First, existing tax and exemption polices in SEZs are not so beneficial to the companies. Also, land in SEZs can be allotted only to units with export activity. "To free this land and use them for developing the corridor and speed up other projects, we have initiated the denotification proposal," said N Nageswara Rao, zonal manager of APIIC. The state government hopes the two Achutaparam SEZs would yield about 1,200 acres of land post-denotification and all three SEZs together will yield 3000 acres. In all, VCIC requires 2,000 acres of land for Vizag part of the corridor. Sources said, denotification will free only vacant land in three SEZs and not affect existing companies already functioning there.
 
 Apart from land for VCIC, freed land from three SEZs can help in developing of other ventures as well. For example, Asian Paints is awaiting land in the Achutapuram area and has assured the state at time of signing of the MoU in 2015 that it will commence construction immediately after land for its unit is handed over to them. 
 
 The state government is also moving swiftly to float special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the VCIC corridor and review the master plan for the corridor prepared by Jurong company. The   (HUDCO) loan support for the corridor is also under scrutiny .
