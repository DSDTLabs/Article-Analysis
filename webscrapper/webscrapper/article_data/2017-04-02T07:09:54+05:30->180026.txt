BENGALURU: An unverified security report has forced the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation ( ) to relocate its Cauvery counter inside the   almost four years ago, causing a loss of Rs 2.3 crore to the state exchequer. 

  A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India ( ) on public sector undertakings recounts the bizarre incident that pins the blame squarely on the then executive officer of  , who also holds the post of deputy commissioner. 
 
  KSHDC opened a Cauvery showroom at a vantage point inside the palace in October 1993, and has been doing brisk business since then. In September 2012, the then executive officer of the Mysore Palace Board asked the handicrafts development corporation to relocate the showroom following "security concerns" in the palace, the report said.
 
 The threats were attributed to the nation's most elite security agency, the National Security Guards. The KSHDC relocated its showroom in November 2012. A month later, a private entity - Sri Srikanteshwara Multipurpose Co-operative society (SSMCS) - was allowed to set up a handicraft outlet at the same vantage point . 
 
  The 2016 CAG audit of KSHDC has found that the entire "security threat" was never on record. "The KSHDC was asked to relocate its showroom on security concerns as per the   report. The handicrafts corporation, however, failed to verify the veracity of the board's claim. We observed that no such report was on record," the CAG noted. 
 
  The CAG said the outlet has been shifted to a relatively hidden spot, which had impacted its revenue since then. From an annual turnover of Rs 2.90 crore in 2011-12, the showroom was able to generate only Rs 1.38 crore in 2015-16.
