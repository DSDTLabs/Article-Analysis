‘Manathe Vellitheru,’ ‘Odaruthammaava Aalariyaam, ‘Akkare Ninnoru Maaran’… The   –   combination has given us many memorable and evergreen comedy moments in Mollywood through the decades. The actors are coming together again in the film ‘Kalyanam,’ which marks the industry debut of Mukesh’s son Sravan.

  In the recently released teaser of the film, Sreenivasan’s character is seen in conversation with a caste-obsessed man, played by Mukesh. Will they take us back in time and trigger memories of all those hilarious moments they created together for their fans? We will have to wait and watch till ‘Kalyanam’ hits theaters.
 
 Varsha Bollamma is the the female lead of Kalyanam, which has music by Prakash Alex.
