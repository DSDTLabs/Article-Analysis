Computer scientist  , who led the development of India's first supercomputer, Param, after the US refused to sell supercomputers to India, wishes to develop   as an advanced digital university with emphasis on IT. “I will be pursuing the former president late A P J Abdul Kalam’s dream to make it a world-class institution which will contribute towards making India an advanced country,” the septuagenarian told Piyush Kumar Trpathi over phone from Pune on Saturday, day after President Pranab Mukherjee appointed him the varsity’s chancellor. Excerpts:

 
 I often talk about India’s knowledge heritage. I once asked Kalam in 2006 how could India become an advanced country. He gave me the example of ancient Nalanda Mahavihara which, he said, would beckon students from across the world in fifth century BC. He said Nalanda University attracting knowledge seekers from across the globe would be a sign of India being an advanced country. Hence, I would like Nalanda University to become that, as world class as Harvard and Oxford.
 
 
 Efforts will be made to ready the campus within five years. When I helmed the IIT-Delhi as its director, we developed its new campus in five years. 
 
 
 Nalanda will be made a digitally advanced university. Efforts will be made to promote digital literacy and also research works for development of future technologies.
 
 
 Autonomy is crucial for proper functioning of a university of global stature like NU. I expect the government to be positive as my experience so far has been positive in this regard. Involvement of government ensures sufficient budgetary support as well as sharing of accountability.
 
 
 I went to Patna once, around 12 years ago. Though I wanted to visit Nalanda then, I could not get time. As for my perception of Bihar, the   government has done some good works, especially when he headed the   government in the state.
