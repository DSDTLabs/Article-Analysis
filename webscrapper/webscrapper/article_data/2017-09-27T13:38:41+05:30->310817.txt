THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government which is set to impose penal provisions like prison term and hefty fines for polluting water bodies is likely to introduce stringent norms regarding sewage management in apartment complexes.Minister for the local self-government (LSG) department K T Jaleel said that   (STPs) will be made mandatory in apartment complexes.

 â€œThe building rules in the state are in for a major revision and one of the changes would be making construction of sewage treatment plants in apartment complexes mandatory . An order will be issued soon,'' said Jaleel. The government's move to ensure scientific management of sewage in apartment complexes will also put to rest the ongoing conflict between the builders and civic bodies regarding construction of STPs in apartment units. At present, the building rules call for a proper service plan for waste and sewage management and water supply. The civic bodies demand   consent as permit condition based on provisions of service plan.
 
 There is disparity in norms followed by various civic bodies with regard to STPs. This often paves way for violation of environmental nor ms. While Kochi corporation insists on producing a consent to operate certificate from pollution control board, before the apartment is given occupancy certificate, a similar demand from Thiruvananthapuram corporation resulted in a face-off between realtors and the civic body . Later, the LSG overruled the directive issued by the corporation.
