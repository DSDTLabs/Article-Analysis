Chennai: Even as the 270-day deadline ends on Friday for the Resolution Professional (RP) to identify a suitor for taking over the beleaguered Rs 4,700 crore Nagarjuna Oil project at Cuddalore, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) that met on Thursday failed to select a successful bidder. “The CoC did not find any of the bids (out of four) acceptable since all of them were below the liquidation valuation (Rs 1,450 crore),” a source privy to the development told TOI. The four bidders were BPCL, Citax Ventures, Gulf PetroChem and Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd. Meanwhile, NOCL Employees Assn’s petition against the RP, Rajendran is listed for hearing before the NCLT on Friday. The RP’s counter petition alleging lack of cooperation from NOCL directors and employees too is listed for hearing on the same day. The outcome of the petitions may well decide the fate of NOCL, since NCLT may be forced to order liquidation in the event of no bidder is identified by Friday.  NOCL, which had planned to set up a 6 mtpa oil refinery at Cuddalore, was struggling to move ahead with the project despite several attempts due to paucity of funds. A cyclone calamity that stuck Cuddalore led to forced stoppage of construction work on the site completely in November, 2011. Consequently, about 25 different operational creditors filed for bankruptcy last year.  The Chennai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) had on July 25, 2017 had given a six-month timeframe to the Resolution Professional (RP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to find a suitor. As the RP needed more time, as permitted under the IBC, a 90-day breathing time was given in January this year to find a suitor and that deadline ends on April 20.
