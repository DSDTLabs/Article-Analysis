COLVA: On May 31, as the clock strikes midnight the 61-day   will be enforced along Goa’s 105km coastline. More than 1,500 trawlers will pull their nets off Goa’s territorial waters for the entire period of the ban.

 
 The ban from June 1to July 31 has been enforced in Goa since 1981. For two year in 2002 to 2004 it was extended to 75 days but was later withdrawn by the government. The main objectives of the fishing ban are to allow several species to spawn and to prevent fishermen from risking their lives in the choppy seas during the monsoon.
 
 A visit to Cutbona fishing jetty at Betul indicated that many trawler owners have already folded their nets and are either transporting it home or have stacked them at the jetty. The ban also sees over 8,000 labourers return to their native places and return only after July 31.
 
 Minguel  , a fisherman, said that the season was good for those with bigger boats but was bad for trawler owners.
 
  president Savio D’Silva backed Rodrigues, “Only those with bigger steel boats have done well as they could venture deeper into the sea for longer periods.”
