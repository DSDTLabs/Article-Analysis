Ludhiana: Deputy commissioner Pardeep Kumar Aggrawal has said that the work on three common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) was likely to commence soon. He along with MLAs Sanjay Talwar and Bharat Bhushan recently visited the site to discuss the progress of the project.

 The deputy commissioner has also issued necessary directions to the officials concerned to get the work started and Punjab Pollution Control Board has already given a sanction to initial funds to start the projects.
 
 There are around 260 textile dyeing industries in the city that have installed individual effluent treatment plants. However in order to monitor pollution load of effluents from these industries at a single outlet, it has been proposed to install three CETPs at a capacity of 50 MLD (million litres per day), 40 MLD and 15 MLD, respectively, for clusters of dyeing industries at Tajpur-Rahon Road, Focal Point and Bahadurke Road. The entire project is likely to cost Rs 135 crore.
 
 The state government has sanctioned an amount of Rs 23 crore for the installation of 15 MLD CETP and work of the project was likely to start in October while work on the other two treatment plants was likely to be completed next year, the DC added.
 
 Agrawal stated that the state government was making efforts to complete the projects at the earliest and with the installation of these treatment plants, pollution levels in Buddha Nullah would be under control to a large extent.
 
 Meanwhile, MLAs Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sanjay Talwar said with the commencement of these projects, development of the city would get a boost and the project would also play a vital role in cleaning the Buddha Nullah. They added that the Punjab government was committed to the development of the city as well as the state in a planned manner.
