PATNA: At least six   and their family members were allegedly roughed up by a group of 200 engineering students, who were protesting death of one of their colleagues at sadar hospital in   on Sunday. The students allegedly barged into the official quarters of the doctors and went berserk.

  Kumar (21), a student of B P  , was admitted to the sadar hospital around 3am on Sunday in a serious condition. He died just 10 minutes after reaching the hospital when the doctors started treating him. The students alleged that Satyendra, who was suffering from acute anaemia, died due to medical negligence. “He had visited the hospital two days back, but the doctors only prescribed him some medicines instead of going for blood transfusion or admitting him there,” the students alleged.
 
 Madhepura civil surgeon Dr G P   said the students later gathered on the hospital premises and assaulted Dr  , who was on duty in the emergency ward. “Students also barged into the quarter of hospital superintendent   and thrashed him. Deputy superintendent Dr Santosh, Dr Keshav and other doctors of the hospital were also roughed up,” he said, adding the students ransacked the furniture and household items in the official quarters of the doctors.
 
 “Satyendra did not consult the doctors after receiving the report of the blood test. Only three grams of haemoglobin was there in his blood, which was far below normal level. When he was brought to the hospital on Sunday, his condition was very serious,” Dr Pandey said. He added the hospital administration would lodge an FIR against the students for attacking the doctors and their family members.
 
  police station Arun Kumar said Satyendra uncle Ramvilas Sahu has lodged an FIR with police in connection with the incident. “Satyendra’s body was handed over to his family members after postmortem and the situation is under control now,” the SHO said. He added the deceased was a resident of   in Madhubani district.
