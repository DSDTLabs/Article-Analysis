BHUBANESWAR: In a dramatic resurgence in the Odisha civic polls, BJP for the first time is on the verge of ruling   (ZPs) in at least four districts on its own. BJP’s impressive performance is a big worry for   who will face 19 years of anti-incumbency in 2019 when assembly polls are scheduled to be held in Odisha. Congress has been virtually wiped out in the civic elections with BJP occupying the opposition space. 

 The result for 537 seats spread over three phases is known through unofficial sources so far. Of these, BJD has won 300, BJP 180 and Congress just 40. Polls are being held in total 853 seats. The remaining seats go to the polls on February 19 and 21 and the results will be officially declared on February 25. BJP appears to be in a position to rule the zila parishads in Kalahandi, Mayurbhanj, Bargarh and Balangir districts. 
 
 In Kalahandi, BJP has won all 25 seats that went to the polls in the three phases, way past the half-way mark of 18 in the 36-member council. In Mayurbhanj, the party has won 27 of the 32 seats where polling has been completed. It needs just another seat out of the 24 left for polling to rule the parishad. 
 
 Thanking voters,  , who was the party’s chief campaigner in the elections, tweeted on Saturday: “BJP won >50% seats in Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region, BJP’s impressive performance in KBK region of Odisha shows poor’s endorsement of Hon’ble PM @narendramodi ji’s fight against black money.” In the 2012 panchayat election, BJP scored a zero while BJD held sway in 28 of the 30 ZPs. The remaining two ZPs went to Congress. That was the year when BJP contested the panchayat election for the first time after it split from BJD in 2009.
