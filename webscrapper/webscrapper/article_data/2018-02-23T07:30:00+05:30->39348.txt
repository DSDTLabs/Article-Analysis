Chandigarh: It was the promptness and alertness of the kidnapped victim that enabled him escape the clutches of the goons and foil their attempt to steal his car.

 Three men had kidnapped Harpreet Singh, son of a city-based businessman, at gunpoint from outside a Sector 9 gym around 8.10pm on Wednesday. After taking him in his Mercedes car, the goons made Harpreet call up his cousin and sought a ransom of Rs 3 lakh. 
 
 Industrial Area Phase-I SHO ZP Khan said the goons took Harpreet, a resident of Sector 10, to Elante mall to collect the ransom from his cousin Jaskaran Singh. Harpreet saw an opportunity and escaped. Before escaping, he took the keys of Mercedes from the dashboard. Meanwhile, the accused left in Harpreetâ€™s car after taking the ransom from Jaskaran around 10pm.
 
 Without keys, the automatic car could not go beyond some kilometres. The goons left the car near the Kalibari light-point and fled.
 
 When Jaskaran informed the police and the DSP (east), Industrial Area SHO and cops from crime branch, operation cell, reached the spot. Police said Harpreet was so scared that he took around 20 minutes to come out of the mall.
 
 SSP Nilambari Vijay Jagdale also reached the spot. In his statements to the police, Harpreet said the accused drove him towards Sukhna Lake, Golf range and then to Sohana, Mohali. After two hours, they came near Elante to take the ransom, when he managed to flee.
