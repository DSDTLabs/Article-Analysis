Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar   on Wednesday announced the government’s plans to amend the Goa Non-Biodegradable   (Control) Act 1996 to ban the use of plastic bags by vendors in Goa.

 Parrikar said that making, carrying and selling of plastic bags will invite a hefty fine of up to Rs 5,000.
 
 "We are going to implement a ban on plastic in the state," Parrikar had said. Littering in public places with plastic waste would evoke a fine of Rs 10,000.
 
 Currently, the state has a ban on the use of plastic bags below 40 microns under the Goa Biodegradable Garbage (Controlled) Act 1996. The government had also made it mandatory for shopkeepers and vendors to register themselves to provide plastic bags under the plastic waste management rules, 2016.
 
 Earlier in the day, the chief minister, in a written reply during the Question Hour, said that the government in a meeting with municipal councils and corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) has decided to identify and establish collection centers on roads to enable public to deposit waste at such centres.
