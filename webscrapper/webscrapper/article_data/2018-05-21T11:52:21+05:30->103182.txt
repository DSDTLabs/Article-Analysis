English   and model   believes that actress and now   of Sussex   is going to be a fantastic asset to the royal family.

  
  
  "I kind of look at the royal family as being a bit like show business. Every time they go out, it's like they're on a red carpet. They're scrutinized, they're looked at. She's had that anyway because she was a major television star and a very talented one and a beautiful young woman who everyone wanted to talk to," Hurley told.
 
  "I have a feeling she's going to be a fantastic asset to our royal family," Hurley added. Hurley currently stars on the E! series, 'The Royals,' a fictional show about the British monarchy. On that note, Prince Harry, sixth in line to the British throne, and Markle sealed their wedding vows with a kiss outside Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel on Saturday, cheered on by thousands of delighted crowds.
 
  The couple now the   and Duchess of Sussex exchanged rings in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and 600 celebrity guests. The Dean of Windsor, the Right Reverend  , conducted the wedding service while the Archbishop of Canterbury,  , officiated it.
 
  Actress and now Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle wore a boat-necked, sculpted white dress for her Royal wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, designed by   for French fashion house Givenchy.
