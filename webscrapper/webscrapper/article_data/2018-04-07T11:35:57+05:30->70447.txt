CHANDIGHARH: A Chandigarh court on Friday dismissed the bail plea of the Punjab and   high court’s former registrar (recruitment) Balwinder Kumar Sharma in the   (judicial) exam leak case. The court of additional sessions judge J S Sidhu rejected the bail plea.

 Defence counsel for Sharma Ramesh Bamal argued in the court that the SIT of the   had failed to find any incriminating evidence against his client, including any phone or audio recording or a financial transaction. He argued if SIT had any evidence, it should put it on record.
 
 The defence counsel said police were making efforts to ruin Sharma’s dignity and had made him a scapegoat to save others. It was pleaded that Sharma should be granted bail as police had falsely implicated him. The scam was unearthed after Suman, a resident of Pinjore in Panchkula, filed a petition before HC, seeking registration of a criminal case into the   (judicial branch) selection examination leakage.
 
 She produced an audio recording of two candidates claiming that most of the seats had been sold out for Rs 1.5 crore each and names of selected candidates had been finalised. She had specifically named two woman candidates Sunita and Sushila for being involved in the scam.
 
 An internal probe conducted by the HC found Sharma responsible for leakage of the paper. The probe committee recommended registration of an FIR in the case.
