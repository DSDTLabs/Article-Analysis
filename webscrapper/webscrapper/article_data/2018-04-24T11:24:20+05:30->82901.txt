CHENNAI: Despite the mushrooming of several CBSE   in Tamil Nadu, none of them appear in the   ( ) admission   launched by the state  , resulting in the parents seeking   for their wards under the quota running from pillar to post of the affiliated   schools to get application forms.

 Authorities say that they have written to the schools asking them to declare the number of seats available under the said quota, which earmarks 25% of seats at entry level classes in all private schools, including  , CBSE and ICSE, for students from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups. It is the government’s responsibility to reimburse their tuition fees to the schools.
 
 However, most schools failed to be transparent when it came to the offline admission process, with the school education department receiving several complaints that rules were flouted while admitting students under this quota. 
 
 To eliminate this, the state government in 2017 launched an online portal (http://tnmatricschools.com/rte/rtehome.aspx) where students can submit application forms directly to the schools for seats under the quota. 
 
 Though all the 19,000 private matriculation schools appeared on the list of available schools that can admit children under RTE quota, none of the 830 CBSE schools in the state figure on the portal. CBSE schools continue to harass parents who seek application forms from them, said MDMK youth wing secretary V Eswaran. “While other states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have managed to add CBSE schools to their respective online application portals, Tamil Nadu has failed its students one more year,” he added. 
 
 Responding to the issue, a senior school education department official said that they are in the process of collecting information on available RTE seats from schools and from U-DISE database.
