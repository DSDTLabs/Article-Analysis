Chandigarh: Nearly two weeks after violent clashes in Phagwara over the contentious proposal, the state government has agreed to rechristen the city’s ‘Gol Chowk’ as ‘Samvidhan (Constitution) Chowk’. The decision was taken at meeting of a delegation of Dalit community with chief minister Amarinder Singh.

 Two Dalit activists had sustained bullet injuries in a clash on April 13 after tension gripped Phagwara when a group of youths installed a flex board bearing a photo of Dr B R Ambedkar and renaming ‘Gol Chowk’ as ‘Sambhidhan Chowk’.
 
 It was pointed out in the meeting that Phagwara Municipal Corporation had already moved a resolution for renaming the chowk. Amarinder gave his in-principle nod to the plan.
 
 “There is nothing wrong in naming the roundabout as Samvidhan Chowk, as our Constitution does not belong to any particular caste or creed and we all Indians are proud of it,” said Amarinder while directing the local administration to follow proper procedure for renaming the chowk.
 
 Meanwhile, family members of the victims of the clash were also present and Amarinder assured them that the state government would ensure proper medical treatment. On a request of the family members of Yashwant Bobby, who sustained serious bullet injuries, Amarinder said his relatives should go for second opinion on his medical condition as the state will bear the cost of his treatment.
 
 On their demand of cancellation of FIRs registered against Dalit youths, Capt Amarinder Singh directed the IGP, Jalandhar Range, to examine all such cases and submit a report to the DGP.
