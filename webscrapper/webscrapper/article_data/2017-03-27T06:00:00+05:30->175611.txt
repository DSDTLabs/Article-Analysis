KOLKATA: Addressing a plea on social media, external affairs minister   on Sunday offered to help a 79-year-old  , who was cured of a lung disease in   Hospital, return home.

 The Twitter appeal on Saturday said that the   Embassy had been informed that Holzer Dieter Siegeried was fit to be discharged, but no one had come to receive him. 
 
 A post from the Twitter handle @BarbieGiri, which tagged Swaraj, read: “79 yr old German  , can’t speak English, cured & fit to discharge now. No one to pick him up. Details below. Help?” 
 
 To this, Swaraj tweeted: “We are taking this up with the German Embassy.”
 
 Siegeried, who was brought to SSKM Hospital from Raigunj District Hospital three weeks back, suffered from acute kidney problem, psychiatric disorders and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or acute lung disorders. He has been cured and is now awaiting his return to Germany.
 
 SSKM sources said Siegeried also has age-related complications. Since he doesn’t speak English, doctors initially faced trouble communicating with him. 
 
 “But with time, doctors have won his confidence and they are communicating with him using signs. He does not require institutionalised care any more,” said a doctor.
 
 Kolkata-based German deputy consul-general Thomas Schrod told TOI, “We have received the information. We will be contacting him on Monday. Our information indicates that he is a tourist who has been travelling across India.”
