Noida: A 22-year-old man was allegedly killed by his cousin and his accomplice in Behlolpur village on Saturday night. The victim, identified as Udayveer, was an original resident of Shahjahanpur. He lived in a rented accommodation with his family members.

 Udayveer worked in a private company in Sector 63. His cousin Akash had a fight with him on some issue last week. However, the matter was resolved as they were relatives and knew each other.
 
 On Saturday night, Akash and his accomplice, Adesh, reached Udayveer’s house with a bottle of liquor. The two started drinking with Udayveer. Police said Akash then started quarrelling with Udayveer in an inebriated condition. Udayveer’s father Naresh heard the noise and came to the spot. He advised the boys against creating a ruckus. Naresh later left the spot for his night duty as a guard in a private company.
 
 Neighbours said the three persons continued with their fight till 11 pm. Naresh returned home in the morning and found that the door was bolted from outside and found Udayveer dead with head injuries.
 
 The two accused had fled after the crime at night. Udayveer’s family has registered a case of murder against the two. A police team found a bloodstained stove top pan (tawa) at the spot. Amit Kumar Singh, SHO, Phase III police station, said that it seems the accused hit the victim with the tawa causing fatal injuries. “The post-mortem reports are awaited. We have launched a search for the accused,” he said.
