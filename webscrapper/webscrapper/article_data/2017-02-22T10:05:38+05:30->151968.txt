 The BJP alleged that the ruling BJD is upset with saffron party's super show in the panchayat polls and indulging in violence to terrorize its workers across the state.
 
  "It is not at all easy for the ruling BJD to digest our success. Hence they are troubling our partymen by lodging false FIRs, beating them and hurling bombs at them. At a few places, our party workers were brutally attacked," alleged Dey. 
 
 He alleged that instead of taking stern action against the BJD ministers and workers involved in violence, police are shielding them. 
 
 "Police are showing undue favour to the ruling party. We will not tolerate it at any cost. If immediate action is not taken against BJD workers involved in violence, we will intensify our agitation," said Dey. 
 
 However, the BJD refuted the allegations.
 
  "The BJP is trying to mislead people by making such false allegations against our party. But the people know what the truth is," said BJD leader and Cuttack-Choudwar MLA Pravat Biswal.
