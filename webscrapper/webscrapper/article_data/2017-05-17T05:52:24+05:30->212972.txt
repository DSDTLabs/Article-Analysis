HARIDWAR: The   of the   ( ), which was launched in October 2016 to demand allotment of land to rebuild the historic Gurdwara Gyan Godri near   in Haridwar, entered its 225th day on Tuesday.

 A group of Sikhs from All India Sikh Conference (AISC) reached Har-ki-Pauri, the original site of the ancient gurdwara, on Monday and sat at the Ganga ghat to offer ardas (prayer to God).
 
 This was in keeping with an announcement made by AISC president Gurcharan Singh Babbar that Sikhs from Delhi and villages around the holy city should reach Har-ki-Pauri in large numbers on the day and hold ardas there. The Sikh leader was taken into custody by police while on his way to Har-ki-Pauri along with his supporters near Paonta Sahib. A small group managed to reach the ghat reportedly by telling police that they were organising a bhandara (public feast) there.
 
 The GGGPC, however, said that its agitation is a peaceful one and it had never involved Sikhs from other organizations. GGGPC president Harjit Singh Dua told TOI, “We had nothing to do with the people who were at Har-ki-Pauri on Monday. Ours is, and will remain, a peaceful agitation to demand land to rebuild the gurdwara at Har-ki-Pauri, which was acquired along with lands of other institutions and shops in 1979 for expansion of Har-ki-Pauri. The gurdwara was historic as it commemorated Guru Nanak Sahib’s visit to Haridwar in 1505.”
 
 According to Dua, of the three sites suggested by the government for the gurdwara, GGGPC accepted the site near Premnagar Ashram in 2003.
