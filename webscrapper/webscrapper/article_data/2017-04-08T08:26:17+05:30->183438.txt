HYDERABAD: When 30-year-old Vandana became increasingly aloof at work, little did anyone realise that she was suffering from a peculiar problem until doctors diagnosed her with ‘melancholic depression’. The IT employee is among the 40% of city psychiatrists’ corporate clientèle found suffering from this form of  .

 “In Vandana’s case, she did not know that she had depression and thought it could be due to marital discord. Her case is a classic example of melancholic depression, where the patient is confused about what ails him/her,” said Dr  , consultant psychiatrist at MaxCure Hospital.
 
 Such cases of depression, experts say, are more prevalent in urban pockets. “We get maximum number of patients from the IT sector,” said Dr Sweta, a consultant psychiatrist with Asha Hospital. People with personality disorders are also prone to this kind of depression, she said.
 
 Melancholic depression is characterized by deep sadness with devastating effects like inability to feel motivated towards any kind of productive activity, acute fatigue and lethargy, lack of interest in initiating and maintaining social interactions. Patients display an overall disinterest in any activity requiring ‘mental energy’.
 
 Doctors say stress and substance abuse can be triggers for this depression, which is more common among men. It primarily affects people in the 20-40 age group. “This is not a dangerous problem. Six to eight weeks of exercise and medication can help resolve it,” said Dr Sweta.
