THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The row over the   has turned out to be a blame-game between the state and the Centre, but the officials concerned in the   are likely to face the music as there is ample proof in the form of a reminder from the Centre, dated January 3. 

 The home department has said it had uploaded the list on the ministry of home affairs ( ) website on December 30. However, uploading the list alone is not the end of the matter, according to sources. 
 
 Top police sources said the   and the hard copy are also sent to the MHA before the deadline, which on most occasions are sent through a special messenger.
 
 On January 3, the Centre sent a reminder to the state that the list has not reached the MHA yet. The list has also to be supplemented with the service records of the officers who have been recommended for the medals and the matter has to be verified by the intelligence bureau (IB) and   officials in the state. 
 
 Police sources said the Centre had sent the reminder even after the deadline lapsed but the state did not bother to respond to the Centre's message. "There cannot be any politics in these matters and the Centre, irrespective of which party is ruling, acts in these matters clearly on the basis of a set of rules and guidelines. Rather than admitting the lapses on our part and taking action against the responsible official, it is unfair to drag politics into the picture," a top official said.
 
 Moreover, the opportunity has been lost for ever for the concerned police officers as there is no such provision for reconsidering the list on the eve of Independence Day. "Some of the officials would retire from the service in the meantime," sources said.
