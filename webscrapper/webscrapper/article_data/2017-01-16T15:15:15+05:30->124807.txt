NEW DELHI: After yet another succesful chase on Sunday, Indian captain   equalled former cricketer  's 17 centuries while chasing. But while Tendulkar took 232 innings to achieve it, Kohli has done it in just 96 essays. Kohli's match-winning 122 on Sunday during the first ODI against England was his 27th overall.

 Comparisons with the great Tendulkar crop up every now and then but Kohli made it clear that it will be very difficult to achieve the heady numbers of the 'Master Blaster'.
 
 "I might not play that long (24 years). 200 Tests, 100 international centuries. Those are incredible numbers and will be impossible to achieve. But yes, I want to make a difference and always believe that I must leave the game on a better note," said Kohli.
 
 Kohli also added that one of the secrets of his stupendous success is "not having too many close people" in his life which adds hindrances such as "distractions" and "time management" on the path of glory.
 
 "Luckily, I don't have too many people in my life that I am close to. I think that helps. If you have too many people and too many friends you speak to, you get distracted and your time management becomes impossible," Kohli told former England captain   in an interview for  .tv.
 
 One of world's premier batsmen, Kohli feels that one should not limit his ambitions. "I think, somewhere as sportsmen, we somehow already limit ourselves to what we do without even knowing how much we can do. That's something I never put a limit on," Kohli said. "I always love to explore my maximum ability as far as my intensity in the field is concerned. And even with managing time, the day I get burnt out is the day, I start cutting down on things. I never put any limitations on what I want to do in life.
 
 "You just got to create a good balance and move forward. It's been fine till now. I am able to maintain a balance as of now I can say," he said.
