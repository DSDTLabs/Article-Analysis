GHAZIABAD: More than 150 parents on Friday protested outside   in   against the alleged demand for increased fees. The protest took place despite former district magistrate Nidhi Kesarwani having told all parents to be patient ahead of the decision on May 11 verdict by the committee formed by her.

 The parents complained that the school has been pressuring them for the submission of fees along with the annual charges which were prohibited under the latest decision of a three-member district-level committee through notices that were sent to various private schools across   including GD Goenka School.
 
 The parents, who demanded that they meet the school principal, said they were not allowed inside school by the security guards. The school eventually called the police, who in turn pacified the parents and faclitated their meeting with a school management official. Details of that meeting were not revealed to the media.
 
 “The school management is aggravating the matter by avoiding us like this,” said Shiv Pandey, one of the protesting parents.
