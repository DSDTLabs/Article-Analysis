Vadodara: M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) has become the first campus in the university where solar rooftop project has been implemented. 

 In association with the Gujarat Energy Development Agency (GEDA), MSU is in the process of identifying other faculties where the solar project can be implemented. According to MSU officials, the project will help reduce the university’s energy bill significantly. 
 
 “The proposal prepared in collaboration with GEDA which has been approved by the syndicate body is to install a total of 964 kilowatt across the university campus. Of this, we have already installed 312 kilowatt while we are in the process of installing solar panel for another 652 kilowatt at other faculties of the campus,” said MSU engineer N K Ojha. 
 
 According to Ojha, the university will be able to save at least Rs 1.40 crore per annum through the project once it gets implemented. 
 
 According to officials, with each kilowatt installed capacity around five units electricity can be generated in a single day which in turn results in generation of 1.44 lakh units per month. 
 
 Considering Rs six as cost per unit, the university will be able to save Rs 8.67 lakh per month and a total of Rs 1.40 crore per year. In terms of units, the university officials suggest that with 964 kilowatt, 17.35 lakh units of electricity can be generated per year. 
 
 Interestingly, university will not spend a penny on the project. “GEDA is implementing the project while we are providing our terraces. As per the requirement, we need flat roof surfaces and terraces where there is direct sunlight without any obstruction of trees,” said Ojha. 
 
 “If the electricity consumption is less than the electricity generated through the project, we will not have to pay anything. If our consumption is more than the power generated through the project, we will have to pay for the balance units consumed at the campus,”
