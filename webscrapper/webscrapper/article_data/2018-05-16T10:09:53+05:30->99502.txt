WELLINGTON: Leg spin allrounder   has been included on   Cricket's list of contracted players for the first time, at the age of 31.

 
 Astle is the only newcomer on the list, released Monday, which has been reduced for the next year from 21 to 20 players. Batsman   and allrounder   have been dropped from the previous list.
 
 The 20 players offered contracts are chosen on the basis of ratings by coach   and selector   across all three formats, with tests carrying twice the weighting of limited overs matches.
 
 Astle made a strong claim to inclusion with his contribution to New Zealand's win over England in a day-night test in March.
 
 "Todd's progress over the past 12 months has been exciting to see"' Larsen said. "When fit, he made the most of his opportunities in both test and ODI cricket.
 
 "We have a big summer ahead; we know Todd performs well in New Zealand conditions and we also have a spin-friendly tour against Pakistan coming up. Between Todd, Ish (Sodhi) and Mitchell (Santner) our spin bowling stocks have probably never looked better."
 
 Larsen said Neesham and Broom "didn't show the consistency required over the past year and we'd like to see them go back and demand our attention again through domestic performance.
 
 "We'll continue to monitor the progress of a number of fringe players who will have the chance to continue to push their case through the NZA program and home domestic season."
 
  contracted players: Corey Anderson, Todd Astle, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Henry Nicholls, Jeet Raval, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Neil Wagner, B.J. Watling, Kane Williamson, George Worker.
