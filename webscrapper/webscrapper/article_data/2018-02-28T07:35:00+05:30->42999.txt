LUDHIANA: As AAP won just one of the 39 seats it contested in the   polls, many have started asking if the party was on the decline in the state.

 Party leaders, however, claim that being a four-yearold party, they are developing a network in the state, and the party will emerge stronger in the coming years.
 
 AAP had fought MC elections in alliance with   (LIP) of Bains brothers, with the former fielding candidates on 39 seats, while LIP had 56 candidates in the elections. LIP got seven seats. The party could not get a single seat in Amritsar (where it fielded 62 candidates), Jalandhar (where it contested 42 seats), and Patiala.
 
 “We are just a four-yearold party, and in the process of developing a network. It will take some time to strengthen the party, but we are here to stay” said AAP spokesperson
