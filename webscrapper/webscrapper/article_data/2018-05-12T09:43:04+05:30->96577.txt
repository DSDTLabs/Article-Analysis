KOLKATA: Morning walkers at   who have been agitating peacefully every Sunday for a year-anda-half demanding a proper children's park on a plot that lies between   and   have vowed to carry on in the face of threats from a 100-strong group of men and women who had converged in minitrucks on the spot last Sunday.

 
 Sumita  , one of the morning walkers who was physically assaulted by a few women who had allegedly arrived from  , said she was abused and threatened of dire consequences if they assembled at the spot next Sunday and carried on with the demand.
 
 KMDA had installed placard at the spot, proclaiming it a childrenâ€™s playground. But the enclosure is unkempt and ridden with tall weeds, making it unsafe for children.
 
 Banerjee has lodged a diary with Rabindra Sarobar PS. Around 100 morning walkers have also signed as witnesses to the intimidation and requested police to step in and ensure they can continue to agitate peacefully. Police sources said a big contingent would be present at the spot on Monday to quell trouble.
