LUCKNOW: Vikas Narain  , who headed the Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigating the   train blast from 2007 to 2010, on Tuesday said that the then Congress government at the Centre had tried unsuccessfully to unearth Pakistani links in the case.

 The former director general (law & order) in Haryana Police also said the blast that claimed the lives of at least 68 people, mostly Pakistanis, was orchestrated by offshoots of Hindu radical organisations.
 
 Rai was speaking on the ninth anniversary of the   encounter at a seminar “Rising government attacks on democracy“ in the memory of slain journalist and activist  . “There is no transparency in the Batla case.The government should have come out with a white paper for closure,“ Rai added.
