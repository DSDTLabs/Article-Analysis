 MUMBAI: In another   plaster collapse in the city, a part of the ceiling   came down in an apartment in a Koparkhairane society on Saturday morning.

 The plaster on the kitchen roof fell on the youth, who stays on rent, but he escaped with minor injuries.
 
 Local corporator   said, “This is the second such incident. Such incidents occur mostly every monsoon due to leakage in the buildings. We have got a structural audit of the buildings done through the experts of IIT Powai. It has been found that the iron reinforcements of the buildings have rusted and can prove dangerous.”
 
 Koparkhairane ward officer Ashok   said the nodal junior engineer was sent to the spot for an inspection. A notice will be served to the society on Monday, seeking the structural audit report. If the remark in the report is negative, the structure will be declared dangerous and the residents will be asked to vacate the flats.   will not be responsible for loss of life or damage to property, Madhvi said.
