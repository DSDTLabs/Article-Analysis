NEW DELHI:   Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday that   had dealt a huge blow to the system that believed all transactions could be done by cash. 

 Replying to the debate on the finance bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley cited extensively from an article by noted columnist Martin Wolf to defend the move to scrap high value notes and pointed to the praise the move had attracted globally.
 
 “Overall, the policy allowed the government to tax black money, at least as a one-off and possibly permanently, given the enhanced risks of holding cash. Overall, there is a transfer of wealth from criminals to the government. It is hard to be sorry for these victims," Jaitley quoted from Wolf’s commentary.
 
 The FM said he was confident that in the next five to seven years more research would be carried out globally to examine India’s experience on demonetization.
 
 Jaitley said the government had taken the decision on demonetisation and the voters have recently demonstrated their support for the move. He expressed surprise at the position adopted by some political parties on the demonetisation issue. 
 
 “It beats me no end that some political parties are listing the virtues of the   when the world is moving towards digitisation and there is global cooperation against tax havens, tax evasion and stamping out the shadow economy, parallel economy and move towards more formal economy,” Jaitley said.
