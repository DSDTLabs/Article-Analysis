PATNA: The Patna   administration on Saturday decided to act tough against those selling poor quality sweetmeat, namkeens and other confectionary items in various shops across the city.

 District magistrate   said food safety, weight and measures and commercial taxes officials will keep a close eye on quality of sweets being sold in different shops besides taking action against those cheating customers while weighing the products. A magistrate will accompany these officials in course of raid.
 
 The   said the decision was taken following complaints that several   were weighing products along with the box. “Since one such box weighs 50gm, the shopkeepers are fooling the customers,” Agarwal said.
 
 He added in many high-end shops and malls, there was no option for the consumers to weigh the packaged product. “These shops have been asked to provide weighing machine to the consumers, failing which they will be punished,” the DM said.
 
 The team will also check the quality of materials being used in preparing sweets and milk products, such as paneer and khoya. “Use of poor quality oil and harmful colours can pose a threat to the health of people,” the DM said. 
 
 The DM also urged the people to remain alert and inform the district administration if they come across any shop selling poor quality food products. “People can call on 2219810 or share the information on Facebook page of the district administration,” said Agarwal. 
 
 The shopkeepers have also been advised to display the rate of various products, inclusive of all taxes, so that a consumer can know beforehand how much he has to pay. All the shops and hotels have been given a one-week time to comply with the order.
