MYSURU: Former Chamaraja MLA  , who lost to BJP’s L   in the recently concluded assembly elections, alleged that a section of   workers and leaders had conspired to ensure his defeat.

 Vasu on Saturday said that former chief minister Siddaramaiah had not taken any action against those in the party, who worked to defeat him. “Siddaramaiah said nothing against those who were responsible for my defeat. One of them was the chairman of a government body,” said Vasu, alluding to the possible role of   in his electoral debacle.
 
 “There was definitely a conspiracy hatched by my own partymen to defeat me. I would not say that was the sole reason, but it was a contributing factor. The block Congress committee has lodged a complaint with the   ( ) about this,” said Vasu.
 
 The former MLA acknowledged that there were other factors that led to his defeat as well. “Around 3,000 votes that I had received five years ago were transferred to the BJP, while rebel JD(S) candidate Harish Gowda managed to eat into some of the Congress votes too,” Vasu said.
 
 He pointed out that he had managed to realise many projects, including the construction of the Jayadeva hospital, Maharani’s Commerce and Management College, during his five-year tenure despite the many obstacles he faced. Clarifying that the defeat in the assembly elections did not signal the end of his political career, Vasu added, “I will continue to be associated with the people, and serve them. Winning and losing are a part of the electoral process. I have lost elections many times in the past, but I continue to be with the people.”
