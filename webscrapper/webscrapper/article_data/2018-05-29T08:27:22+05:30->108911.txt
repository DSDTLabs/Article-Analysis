BENGALURU: A team of heritage enthusiasts has stumbled upon a 13th-century stone   in JP Nagar’s Sarakki in south Bengaluru. Strangely, a major portion of the relic is buried in the foundation of Anjaneya temple and talks are on with the temple trust to recover the same.

 
 Rajeeva Nrupathunga,   (RHH), an NGO, said the inscription bears the name Veera Ballala, who was a king of the Hosyala empire. “The Hosyala dynasty ruled the present Karnataka region between the 10th and 14th centuries. A large portion of the stone, which measures 8x8 ft, is buried in the foundation. Going by the dimensions, it could be the second-biggest stone inscription for the city after the Hero Stone Inscription in Begur, which dates back to 900AD,” he added.
 
 “After speaking to the temple trustee, we learnt that the stone inscription might have shifted to the foundation area during the temple’s renovation about 60 years ago or another makeover the temple went through 15 years ago. The temple has ahistory of over 350 years,” said Prashanth B, a heritage buff.
 
 RHH is in talks with temple authorities to restore the stone inscription so that it can be studied. “There was more than one king by the name Veera Ballala under the Hoysalas. Only after analysing the entire inscription can we say which one it mentions,” said an RHH member.
 
 According to historians, Bengaluru was home to over 175 recorded stone inscriptions in the early 21st century, with some dating back to the 5th century. But 70% of them have either been lost or are in bad shape due to negligence.
