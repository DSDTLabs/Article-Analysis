NEW DELHI: Congress and other opposition parties mocked  's decision that its MPs would not accept salary for the washed out Parliament session, asking if foregoing the daily Rs 2,000 allowance would compensate for scams worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore under the Modi government.

 
 Congress spokesman   slammed the NDA decision as a gimmick devised to distract attention from scams like Nirav Modi's PNB fraud and serious allegations levelled by saffron allies like TDP.
 
 He said the government decision to bring a bill to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act in   was another poor attempt to portray the opposition as blocking measures to check graft.
 
 Babbar asked if BJP was so opposed to blockade of Parliament, would the ruling party "express remorse for the winter session of 2010 which fell prey to its disruption".
 
 On Thursday, BJP ally Shiv Sena and Rajya Sabha MP   said they did not agree with the decision to forego salaries for 23 days.
 
 Swamy said he had attended Parliament regularly and would take his salary because the disruptions were "not his fault". Swamy said he was the President's nominee and could not forego his salary until the President directed him to do so. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, "It is the government's responsibility to run Parliament. Sena MPs will decide on whether to donate their salaries to distressed farmers or not."
 
 CPM's deputy leader in Lok Sabha Mohd Salim said the NDA's decision was an attempt to occupy the "moral high ground" after it allowed corruption to thrive under its watch.
