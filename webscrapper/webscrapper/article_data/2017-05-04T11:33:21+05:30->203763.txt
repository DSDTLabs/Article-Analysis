GUWAHATI: The state government on Wednesday announced a   of Rs 10,000 as immediate relief for each household affected by the devastating fire that broke out at SK Bhuyan Road near Ambari here on Tuesday night. 

 A huge fire gutted at least 46 houses in the area, damaging properties worth lakhs. However, there are no casualties. Fire fighters had to struggle for hours to control the blaze. 
 
 Inspecting the fire-ravaged site, finance minister   said the state government will take all the necessary steps to rehabilitate the victims at the same location. "Proper rehabilitation package will be offered to the affected families after assessing the total damage in the fire," said Sarma. 
 
 A temporary accommodation has been provided to the fire victims at the   and at the office of the directorate of handloom & textile, Assam. Locals, too, too have come forward to help.
 
 The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has been working to provide sufficient food items, drinking water and medical assistance to the victim families. "Necessary steps were taken for children who have lost their study materials in the fire by providing free books and study materials," said Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner M Angamuthu.
 
 He has also ordered a detailed inquiry into the incident and sought a report within 7 days.
 
 Police commissioner   said the owner of the land where the incident took place would be brought under the ambit of investigation. "It has been found that construction of rented houses in the area was made haphazardly, inconveniencing fire tender vehicles. Owners found to be violating the basic safety norms in making such constructions will be dealt with severely," he added. 
 
 The state's fire & emergency services department has been asked to conduct a survey of such haphazard and vulnerable locations of the city soon. Though the reason behind the fire is yet to be known, it's believed to have been set off by multiple LPG cylinder blasts.
