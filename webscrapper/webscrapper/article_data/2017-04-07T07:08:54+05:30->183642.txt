 Not at all. We share a great friendship. He congratulated me soon after my nomination for R K Nagar was announced, and I expressed my wish to see him. It was he who invited me to his residence later. I went with a shawl and he draped it around my shoulders and posed for a photograph with me. He told me to use it on Facebook. I had mentioned that he invited me to extend his wishes and not to support my candidature. Every actor wants to be neutral and Rajini's fans belong to various parties.
 
 
 
 
 I have been associated with the party for more than four years. I campaigned for the party candidates in the last election.BJP appreciated my commitment.
 
 
 
 
 My issue is nothing compared to land grabbing allegations against them across the state. I was approached by several people, including bigwigs, who lost their properties to them, urging me to float an association. I was made to sign papers without knowing the name of purchaser in front of an officer of the registration department. The whole incident was traumatic and left me shattered. But I am contes ting in R K Nagar to serve people.
 
 
 
 TTV Dhinakaran faction has been identifying houses to distribute money . We took up the issue with the commission. All I can say is violations continue.

 It's good. They recognize me and take selfies with me. I can see they want an alternative. I am confident of winning the elections.
