PANAJI: A garbage contractor found to be burning waste - including plastic and biomedical refuse - at his scrapyard in Merces, has been slapped with a fine of Rs 25,000. As per solid waste management rules, incineration of garbage in open places is prohibited. 

 On receiving a telephonic complaint from the Merces Manch Welfare Association (MMWA), the   (GSPCB) directed the Merces panchayat to ensure that the contractor deposits the fine with the   collector. The illegal incineration in the scrapyard bearing survey number 6/2 at   in Merces, was also verified by the Old Goa police.
 
 “The contractor was collecting different types of waste from hotels and other establishments,”   of the  , said.
 
 In a landmark order in December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had prohibited burning of waste in open places and had stipulated a fine of Rs 25,000 on each incident of bulk waste-burning as environmental compensation. Despite the GSPCB’s action in a few cases, burning of plastic and other garbage is rampant all over the state. Environmental activists allege that the large-scale and unscientific disposal of garbage through this mode has become routine.
 
 In recent months, the board had imposed fines on the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) for burning waste at the Campal parade ground. The Mapusa Municipal Council had also been fined for a similar offence. Among local self-governing bodies, the Penha da Franca panchayat had been penalised for burning dry waste behind the   police station, while the St Cruz and Taleigao panchayats had topped the list of offenders earlier.
