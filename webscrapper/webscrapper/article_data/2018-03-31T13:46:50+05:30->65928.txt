 Mahtani’s show pulled the curtains down on the first day of this three-day fashion extravaganza. Her show was opened by Noyonita Lodh (Yamaha Fascino Miss Diva 2014-Miss Universe India), who wore a multi-coloured metallic dress and golden head gear.

 Talking about her association with   for the second time in a row, an elated Sonakshi said, “It feels great (to be back). You guys love me a lot and so you keep calling me back.”
