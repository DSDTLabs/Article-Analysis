Jaipur: After the photo of health minister Kali Charan Saraf urinating at a public place in the city went viral, a video clip of him defending his act surfaced on Thursday.

 A citizen had photographed Saraf while the latter was allegedly relieving himself by the roadside in Jaipur’s Jhalana area on Tuesday. In the video that surfaced on Thursday, the health minister is heard rubbishing his act as a trivial matter.
 
 In the video, the minister was caught on camera saying, “Itna bada issue nahi hai” (It’s not a big issue). Though two days have passed, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is unwilling to take any action against Saraf.
 
 City mayor Ashok Lahoti remained unavailable for comments though TOI tried to contact him several times.
 
 The health minister has embarrassed the BJP government in Rajasthan, especially when the JMC team is leaving no stone unturned to secure the top rank in the Centre government’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
 
 As per provisions, urinating on roads will attract a fine of Rs 200. Recently, in a separate incident, another video of a JMC team beating a man who was found defecating on the public road had gone viral.
 
 With the minister caught urinating in his own constituency, Congress went on the offensive. Congress’ Rajasthan vice-president Archana Sharma said that these leaders were sending the wrong message by such “shameful” deeds at a time when so much money was being spent on Swachh Bharat.
 
 “During Dholpur bypolls, Saraf had urinated in public. However, we failed to click a photo as we has to reach for a meeting urgently,” she said.
