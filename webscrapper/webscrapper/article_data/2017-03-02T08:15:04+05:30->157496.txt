KOCHI: The high court has allowed   to continue with the action being taken against some of the accused in   corruption case. 

 The court's decision came while disposing petitions filed by Mumbai-based   chairman   and   managing director S Vadivelu, who are accused in the case related to irregularities in purchase of fly ash and laminated bags by Malabar Cements Ltd. 
 
 However, the court had directed that after completion of the proceedings by the enforcement directorate, final report should only be filed with the court's permission.
 
 Vigilance has filed a report naming Patel as an accused in causing a loss of Rs 4.59 crore to Malabar Cements in the purchase of laminated bags from his company from 2003 to 2007. 
 
 The allegation against Vadivelu relates to irregularities amounting to Rs 2.7 crore in the purchase of materials, including bags, by Malabar Cements from his firm.
 
 Enforcement directorate had issued summons to both Harshad and Vadivelu to appear before it for questioning on the basis of a report filed by vigilance. 
 
 They were asked to appear at the sub zonal office of enforcement directorate at Kozhikode. 
 
 In the petitions to the high court, both of them had challenged the summons.
 
 They had contended before the court that the offences alleged against them do no come within the purview of enforcement directorate to take action. 
 
 Action being taken by the directorate is not sustainable as per law, they had contended. Central government had informed the court that enforcement directorate has the power to act as the case also involves allegations regarding offences under Prevention of   Act.
