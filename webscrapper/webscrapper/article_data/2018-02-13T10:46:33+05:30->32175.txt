AGRA: An   by   against a centre superintendent conducting   board exams for inadvertently distributing class XII mathematics (II) paper on February 9, three days before it was scheduled to be held on Monday.
 
  Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mathura, Swapnil Mangain, said, “The FIR was registered against Vinod Kumar, centre superintendent of Sri Ganga Ram Baba Saraswati College, under the UP Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998 on Sunday.”
  
  According to DIOS (district inspector of schools) Arun Kumar Dubey, information about the paper leak was received on Sunday evening and the same was confirmed through CCTV footage of the centre. “Maths (I) paper was scheduled on February 9 but centre superintendent Vinod Kumar had wrongly distributed question papers of maths (II). After students reported about it, the papers were retrieved but the incident was not reported to higher authorities by Vinod. He has been debarred from examination responsibilities for five years.” Dubey added that static magistrate Narendra Kumar was also present in the centre when the incident took place.
  
  District magistrate of Mathura, Sarvagya Ram Mishra, has sought an explanation from static magistrate Narendra Kumar for not informing the administration. Action against Narendra will only be taken after his reply is received, informed Mishra.
  
  To ensure cheating free exam, the administration this year has taken extra preventive measures, including installation of CCTV cameras, maintaining records of absentee students, seeking services of local intelligence units and the Special Task Force (STF). Over 10 lakh students were reported absent in the first four days of the board exams that began on February 6 following the government’s crackdown. Despite stricter provisions, multiple cases of paper leak have however come to light from various parts of the state.
