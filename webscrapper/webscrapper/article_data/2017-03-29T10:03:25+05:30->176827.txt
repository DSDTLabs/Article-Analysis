BENGALURU: A week after legislators lambasted the  , assembly speaker on Tuesday constituted a 13-member joint legislative committee to devise a policy that would regulate the operations of the fourth estate.

 The committee will be headed by health and family welfare minister KR Ramesh Kumar, and comprise Ashok M Pattan, BR Yavagal, NA Haris, Shivaraj S Tangadagi, ST Somashekhar, BA Kage, Suresh Gowda, Sa Ra Mahesh and Narayan Gowda. The committee will suggest measures to prevent what the legislators dubbed “irresponsible” and “arbitrary” coverage of the media. “Three council members will be added to the committee once they send in their names,” said Koliwad.
 
 Most of the members on the committee had recounted bitter encounters with the media last week. Legislators, cutting across party lines, had accused the media – print and electronic – of indulging in extortion, blackmail, besides misleading the public. Although they initially trained their guns on television channels, the print media too came in for censure later.
 
 However, higher education minister Basavaraj Rayareddi expressed his opposition to the move. “Regulation of the media by the government could stifle public debate and harm democracy in the long run. The alternative is to encourage self-regulation,” read his letter to Koliwad.
 
 In the legislative council, opposition leader KS Eshwarappa asked the chairman not to induct   members to the committee. “From the beginning, I have maintained that this issue cannot be solved by a method of confrontation. It calls for discussion between the two parties,” he said.
