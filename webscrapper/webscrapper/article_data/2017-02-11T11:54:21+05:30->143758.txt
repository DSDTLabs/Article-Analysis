NAGPUR: Patients at the   and Hospital’s (IGGMCH) casualty and outpatient departments can soon look forward to enjoying ‘cool’ facilities while awaiting their turns. This is the first time such a facility is being provided at a   in the city. 

 IGMCH associate professor Dr Ravi Chauhan told TOI that  , the collector, is “providing funds of Rs60 lakhs” for the project through the district planning commission (DPC). “The funds are expected to be allotted in April,” he said.
 
 At IGGMCH, air-conditioning is currently being provided at the intensive care unit (ICU), operation theatre (OT) and ward No. 3 (burn ward).
 
 “In summer season, it will bring great relief for patients,” said Chauhan.
 
 A proposal for the project has been submitted to the collector. “By using industrial unit, the same project could have cost us Rs92 lakhs. But we are using the urban unit which costs Rs60 lakhs. But for an extended warranty, there is not much difference between both,” said Chauhan.
 
  is also set to receive in next 15 days nine e-rickshaws one of which would be modified to carry a stretcher. The total cost of the rickshaws was Rs28.94 lakhs. The e-ricks would be driven by class 4 employees. A final demonstration was done last week.
 
 “We will also use the e-ricks to collect medical waste, supply food from mess to wards and transfer medicines from drug stores to wards. A vehicle will also be on-call for woman doctors who can use in the night,” said Chauhan.
