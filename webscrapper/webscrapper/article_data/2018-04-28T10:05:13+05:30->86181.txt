BHUBANESWAR: Former MP and wife of  's ex-chief minister Giridhar Gamang,   Gamang, resigned from the ruling   on Friday, accusing the leadership of neglecting her in the party. 

 Hema had joined the BJD ahead of the 2014 assembly elections and unsuccessfully contested from   assembly segment. 
 
 Briefing reporters at Rayagada, Hema said she has forwarded her resignation letter to BJD president and chief minister  . "I regret my decision to join the party. I could not meet the chief minister despite several attempts. All the supporters, who had also joined the ruling party with me, are also repenting their decision," she said.
 
 Recently, the former Koraput MP had alleged bureaucratic interference in the ruling party and large-scale corruption under the BJD rule.
 
 To queries about her next move, she said she would talk about it very soon. Speculation is rife that Hema will follow in her husband's footsteps and join the BJP as she had met Union petroleum minister   on April 15. Giridhar had also left   and joined the saffron party in 2015.
 
 She was elected to Lok Sabha from Koraput on a Congress ticket in 1999 when her husband was chief minister in the state. In 2004, she was also elected to the assembly from Gunupur segment in Rayagada district.
 
 According to political observers, Hema's exit may weaken the ruling party's tribal support base as the Gamang family has considerable influence over the tribal community in Koraput and Rayagada districts. Last year, Jayaram Pangi, a four-time MLA and a known tribal face in the region, had also joined the BJP after falling out with the ruling party leaders.
 
 BJD vice-president and cabinet minister Surya Narayan Patro said Hema's exit will have no impact on the ruling party. "People of the state have blessed us because of the dynamic leadership of our chief minister and our welfare programmes. I don't think the exit of any individual will have any impact on our party," Patro said.
