HYDERABAD: After spending the night in two hotels at Banjara Hills and Madhapur, Congress and JD(S) MLAs from Karnataka were shepherded back to Bengaluru on Friday night after the Supreme Court ordered at floor test at 4pm on Saturday.

 Sources said 71 Congress MLAs and 35 JD(S) legislators were housed in the two hotels, where rooms were booked in the name of a marriage party so that BJP could not track down the corralled legislators. The MLAs were taken back in the same three buses they had arrived in.
 
 During the day, the Congress MLAs elected former chief minister Sidaramaiah as their legislature party leader. Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamy had arrived in the city between 4.30pm and 5.30pm and later left by chartered flights.
 
 Sources said that Kumaraswamy had called up Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and sought his help. Naidu welcomed the MLAs and offered safe houses in Vijayawada, Guntur and Visakhapatnam. But the legislators decided to proceed to Hyderabad as it offers a number of direct flights to Bengaluru. According to sources, JD (S) president H D Deve Gowda phoned Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and sought his help. The MLAs received Telangana police protection while the checked into their hotels.
 
 High drama was witnessed at the Banjara Hills hotel. Amid rumours that men representing BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy had checked into another star hotel in the vicinity and were luring the herded MLAs with fabulous offers, vigil was stepped up and legislators confined to their floors and rooms.
 
 At one point, Congress teams rounded up a person inside the hotel on the suspicion that he was Galiâ€™s man but it turned out to be a false alarm.
