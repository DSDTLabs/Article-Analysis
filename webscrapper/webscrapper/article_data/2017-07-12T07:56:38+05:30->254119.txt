HYDERABAD: The   on Tuesday directed the Telangana government to respond to a   moved by Congress leader and former minister   accusing the state of moving ahead with its plans to   and a pylon in the vicinity of the Hussainsagar in violation of the  's orders.
The matter was heard by a bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice T Rajani.
 
 Echoing the petitioner's concerns, his counsel Jandhyala Ravi Shankar told the bench that the state is proposing to construct a six-storeyed commercial complex on the banks of the Hussainsagar with a 200-ft tall pylon on its terrace. The state has already earmarked Rs 80 crore for this despite the apex court banning any such construction activity in the vicinity of Hussainsagar, the PIL said.
 
 The PIL also alleged that a huge conspiracy is currently underway to drive away the nearby slum dwellers by luring them with promises of double bedroom houses.
 
 “Because there are judicial orders against constructions, these double bedroom houses will not come up in the lake vicinity , but poor people are already being dispossessed with such illusionary promises. Probably, the TRS leaders will hand over this land to private parties,“ the petition said.
 
 Though the state is under an obligation to obtain clarifi cation or permission from the Supreme Court before venturing into the vicinity of the lake, it did not do so, Jandhyala said.
 
 Telangana AG K Ramakrishna Reddy , who sought a week's time for filing a counter on behalf of the state, told the bench that the government is planning to construct the double bedroom houses in the Ranigunj area, which is far from the lakebed.
 
 “There are 30-year-old houses in some of the areas and we are demolishing them for building double bedroom complexes. We are not constructing anything in the buffer zone of the lake or the full tank level (FTL) area,“ the AG said. The bench sought a detailed reply from the state within one week.
