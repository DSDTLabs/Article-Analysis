BHOPAL: With   all set to campaign in  , the state Congress is welcoming the move while also resorting to a balancing act between her and AICC vice-president  .

 No one in the state Congress wants to overtly praise her without mentioning that Rahul Gandhi also belongs to the same family. PCC president Arun Yadav is known to be part of the Rahul Gandhi gen-next team of Congress. Asked about Priyanka’s role in Uttar Pradesh and its likely effect in Madhya Pradesh, he said, “In the Nehru-Gandhi family, who will take up which role in politics is decided by AICC president  . 
 
 As a Congress’ worker, my loyalties till my last breath are with the entire family.” State Congress chief spokesman KK Mishra argued, “Both the leaders have courage and inspiration to lead the party. They are committed to the Congress’ cause and will remain so. If Sonia Gandhi along with Rahul and Priyanka continues to play active role then the party is sure to benefit further.”
 
 State Congress’ legal cell chief JP Dhanopia said Priyanka playing a bigger role in the UP assembly elections will immensely benefit the party and there will surely be an impact of it in Madhya Pradesh. PCC spokesman Ravi Saxena said, “We welcome Priyanka’s move to actively campaign in Uttar Pradesh and hope she will be a star campaigner in 2018 assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh too. Congress will definitely benefit from it.”
