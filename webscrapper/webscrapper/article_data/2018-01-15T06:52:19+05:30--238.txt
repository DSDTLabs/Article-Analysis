HYDERABAD:   managing director   has claimed that there are "least number of offenders", in terms of road accidents, in the Corporation. However, Hyderabad   data reveals 120 cases were registered against RTC bus drivers for causing road accidents in the city in the past one year. On the outskirts, especially in the Cyberabad police commissionerate limits, 27 RTC buses were involved in fatal accidents. 

 According to Hyderabad Traffic Police, nearly 10% of fatal accidents were caused by RTC buses. "However, if we compare the accident figures with state-owned bus services in other metros, Hyderabad records less number of fatal accidents caused by the state-run corporation," deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Hyderabad, AV Ranganath said. 
 
  MD Ramana Rao has claimed Telangana had logged the lowest number of RTC bus-related accidents among state-run transport services in the country. "Most fatalities have occurred when passengers try to board a running bus or jump from a moving one. We are aware that nearly 120 accidents were caused by RTC buses, but not many were fatal accidents. Once we get a complaint about an accident, we conduct an enquiry and also cooperate with police. Only if the driver is found guilty, he will be suspended," Ramana Rao told TOI. 
 
 According to data provided by traffic police, 31 people died after being hit by RTC buses in 2017. Of them, nearly 50% victims were two-wheeler riders. 
 
 "Most RTC buses are involved in other traffic violations like rash driving, negligent driving or stopping vehicle in the middle of the road and cause traffic congestion. Fourteen victims were either bus passengers or pedestrians," Ranganath added. 
 
 In 2017, Hyderabad Traffic Police had issued 1,518 challan against RTC buses, of which 1,144 challans were still pending.
