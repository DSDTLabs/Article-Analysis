 The aim is to provide 1million litres of RO water per day (1MLD) to the poor.
 
 Currently, Jal Kal is levelling the ground for setting up this infrastructure near Kukrail drain embankment in Luv Kush Nagar. This is about a 500 sq ft plot where the   will be set up. The factory will be made up of aluminum and water machines. It will have 4-5 taps where the slum dwellers can queue up to fill bottles and buckets.
 
 While initially the machines will draw underground water through a boring pump, Jal Kal plans to later connect these machines with water reservoirs in the city to reduce dependence on underground water.
 
 The Centre has granted about Rs 31 crore to   for setting up the RO machine. Officials said after Indiranagar, it will target other areas where several people are devoid of clean drinking water, like Charbagh, Daliganj, Khurramnagar and Chinhat.
