Mohali: Mohali municipal corporation ( ) is all set to renovate around 50 odd parks situated in the residential areas, which would cost Rs 5 crore. The tenders for the project will soon be floated. 

 MC commissioner   said, "We have planned to renovate the parks that have been neglected from the past many years and are situated inside the colonies or cluster of houses in various residential areas. Every park will have proper sitting arrangements,  ,  , walking pathways, jogging tracks, swings and proper lighting arrangements. RWAs' demand to renovate such park was long pending."
 
 MC will also provide portable toilets in the nearby areas of such parks as part of facility for the residents.   said that renovation will be carried out keeping the requirements of senior citizens and children in mind these parks.
 
 Earlier the maintenance of 550 odd parks in the city was outsourced by MC for which it is required to pay Rs 7 crore annually to the company. The outsourced project has already come under controversy as councillors have lodged a written complaint with MC mayor against the company for not performing as per the agreement.
