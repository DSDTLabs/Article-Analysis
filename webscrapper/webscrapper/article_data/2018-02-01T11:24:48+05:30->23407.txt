GUNTUR: It seems the occasional visits by VIPs help improve facilities for citizens. Major roads that were neglected for nearly three years, despite being pothole-ridden, are up for some facelift. 

 Thanks to   M Venkaiah Naidu’s upcoming visit to the city, the district administration has swung into action and are readying the roads. Roads on which the Vice President is expected to travel during his day-long visit on February 3 are being reconstructed.
 
 The   between APSRTC bus station and Autonagar, which is full of potholes and is one of the worst, is being hurriedly repaired. The authorities are restoring the road now, even as commoners have been complaining about the same for the past several months. The R&B officials delay works citing ongoing underground drainage project. Interestingly, the GMC authorities made the UGD contractor complete the work on this particular stretch on a war footing in the last week. The R&B officials began to work and started construction of roads even as the UGD work is going on, in order to meet the deadline stipulated by the district collector. “Whatever the reason, construction of new roads is a relief for us,” said  , a lecturer at a college.
 
 Similarly, the   road is being beautified with flower plants and green lawns on the medians. GMC commissioner C Anuradha, and superintending engineer D Marianna inspected the works on Wednesday, and asked the contractor to complete all the pending work by Thursday.
