VIJAYAWADA:In what could prove to be a major setback for Andhra Pradesh, the Union home ministry has said that Section 108 of the   Reorganisation Act (APRA) 2014 cannot be extended unless a situation comes where the Act needs to be amended. Extension of the section can be given only after amendment to the Act, the Union home ministry has clarified.

 The twin Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana wanted a three-year extension of APRA's section 108 to resolve inter-state issues. Both states, especially  , had been asking for extension to resolve the issue of sharing of assets falling under Schedule 9 and 10 of the reorganisation Act.
 
 Andhra Pradesh officials said that the home ministry officials expressed helplessness in extending the term of section 108 as it can be done only if the APRA is amended in Parliament.
 
  “Only in case of extreme emergency, where anomalies in the Act have to be removed, can it be amended and extended,“ a top state government official, who participated in the discussions in Delhi recently, told TOI. Section 108 (1) of APRA says: “If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the President may, by order, do anything not inconsistent with such provisions which appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of removing the difficulty, provided that no such order shall be made after three years from the appointed day.“
 
 Former president   has earlier issued orders under Section 108 on a few occasions. One was on inclusion of seven mandals of   district with Andhra Pradesh for the sake of construction of Polavaram project.
 
 The other two orders were for rectifying the typographical errors in APRA-2014 with regard to number of MLC seats. If the term of Section 108 elapses, then the President cannot remove the difficulties by an order. Then the problems will have to be addressed by a federal separate Act.
