DARBHANGA: The Darbhanga-headquartered   administration on Saturday notified the retirement of six principals. 

 They include D C Chaudhary of Marwari College- Darbhanga, C B P Singh of KS College-Laheriasarai, P K   of RN College-Pandaul, P C L Das of JMDPL Mahila College- Madhubani, S B Singh of DB College-Jaynagar and   of UR College-Rosera. 
 
 They were retired as they had attained the age of 62 years prior to the enactment of   State Universities Amendment Act, 2017 which categorised principals as teachers and, as such, increased their retirement age also to 65 years.
 
 The notification issued by LNMU registrar   reads, “Since these six teachers attained the age of 62 years prior to May 18 this year (when the new Act was enacted), they are declared retired.”
 
 Sources said the six superannuated principals have been directed to hand over the charge of principal to the most senior teacher of their respective colleges.
