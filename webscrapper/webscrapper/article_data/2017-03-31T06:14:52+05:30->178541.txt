GHAZIABAD: Residents of   are poised for a summer free from   as   ( ) gets ready to launch the newly constructed 400-kVA substation at Indirapuram’s Kala Patthar Road. The substation would be made operational in multiple phases and the first phase would be launched on April 15, said power officials. 

  on Thursday said the substation would supply electricity to the entire trans-Hindon area (Vaishali, Kaushambi, Pratap Vihar and Indirapuram). These localities are currently dependent on the Sahibabad substation which gets its share of power from the substation in Muradnagar. In case of a deficit at Muradabad station, the area gets its power supply from Noida, according to officials.
 
 A senior PVVNL official told TOI that the new substation has two 400/220-kV transformers, which are of 500MVA capacity each, and three other 220/33-kV transformers of 60MVA capacity each. “The 60MVA transformers will be made operational in the first phase from April 15,” he said.
 
 However, Jigyasu Pun, RWA secretary of Gaur Green City, one of the residential societies, is of the view that the substation poses a threat to green spaces. “The construction of this substation adjacent to our society threatens the green space in the vicinity. We had also filed a case against the substation with the NGT in 2013. 
 
 The NGT had sought a report to discuss alternative space for construction of this substation but eventually, in 2014, it was set up here.
