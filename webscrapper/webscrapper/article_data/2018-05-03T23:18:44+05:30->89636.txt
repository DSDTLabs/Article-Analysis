MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday said it will not permit the Metro-IIB work to proceed unless   produces the permissions for digging the road at  , Andheri (W).

 “Even if it is Metro, unless we are satisfied it is legal, we will not allow you to continue,” said a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla. It heard a petition by JVPD Housing Association, Gulmohar Societies and Nanavati Hospital to direct the Dahisar-DN Nagar Metro corridor be made underground. When informed that barricades were erected for soil testing on April 24, MMRDA was told to produce the permission. But its advocate Kiran Bagalia reiterated, “We have extensive powers under the Metro Act. We do not need permissions.” She added that the work is being done on “public road, and not on private roads”. Eleven elevated stations are to be constructed along S V Road between Bandra and Andheri for the Dahisar-DN Nagar corridor.
 
 The judges said MMRDA should have produced some order authorizing the digging work and despite repeatedly asking, it was not answering. “You can’t keep repeating ‘we have authority’ as otherwise any officer will start digging on roads,” said Justice Oka. 
 
 Bagalia then said there is no specific permission but BMC will give it. ``Does that authorise all officers to go on the streets and dig anywhere? Roads do not belong to MMRDA. Are you not supposed to coordinate with other agencies?" asked Justice Oka.
 
 Bagalia later informed that MMRDA has entered into a contract. She said ``the digging is only for soil testing’’ and no further work will be carried out till the court hears the matter. Posting the hearing on June 12, the judges clarified that her ``statement will remain confined to this stretch of the road.”
