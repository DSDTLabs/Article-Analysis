 star   believes that stardom can be a 'distraction' and said she tries to stay ground by doing what she loves. The 24-year-old   recently appeared on show, where she opened up about fame and how she copes up with it. 

  
  
 "I can see how it can be distracting, especially when you do get a bit more recognisable, and maybe you're sort of in the public eye a little bit more and stuff," Ronan said. "But if you're why it is you're doing this - it should be because you love it - it keeps you quite levelheaded," she added. 
 
 The   actor, who hails from  , also said that she supports Irish women's campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which makes abortion illegal in the country. "I'm fully in support of a yes vote. A lot of the people I know are. There's so many women everyday that have to travel abroad mainly to the UK to have an abortion and what this will do is just give women the choice and full ownership over their own body," Ronan said.
