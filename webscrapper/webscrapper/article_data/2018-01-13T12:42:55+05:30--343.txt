KOCHI: Who is justice Chelameswar? How is he as a judge? These questions come to the minds of all those who heard about the press conference held by   and three other   judges on Friday.

 As a TOI reporter, I used to go and sit at Justice J Chelameswar’s court on a daily basis to watch the proceedings when he was the chief justice of the   high court from March 2010 to October 2011.
 
 Witnessing the proceedings at his court used to be a refreshing and rewarding experience. By the end of the forenoon session, I would witness the judge pass judicious orders on at least three cases that were worth reporting. A sense of justice prevailed throughout the proceedings and Justice   used to wave his right hand, with his index finger extended, as a warning sign for anybody attempting to move the court away from the path of justice. The waving hand used to be the signal for any lawyer who attempted to sway the court away from justice by arguing on the strength of legality alone.
 
 During one session, a young woman lawyer was arguing a case for the petitioner, a resident, and the opposite side, a local body, was represented by a senior lawyer. The young lawyer argued vociferously about the denial of rights to her client by the local body and how it affected her party. The senior counsel tried to establish that the local body was entitled to do so as per law. The right hand of the judge began waving then and the court ruled in favour of the young lawyer and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the local body.
 
 As soon as the judge finished dictating the judgment, the young lawyer rushed out of the CJ’s court. I went after her to get details of the case. As soon as she passed the court’s doors, she jumped up in joy. To me, it was the symbol of justice done. Many CJs have come and gone since Justice Chelameswar, but never has the Kerala high court witnessed such a scene.
