SHIMLA: In its war against drug mafia the   government launched a drive for two weeks, from January 19 to February 1. During his period the police have registered cases against 66 Indians and 7 Nepalese and seized 27.515kg of charas, 215gm opium, 38.279kg of poppy husk, 55.868kg of ganja, 37.175gm of heroin and 19.83gm of cocaine.

 Setting a target of 100 days to detect and check narcotics cases, the police took strict action against mining mafia operating in the state. During the drive police also seized 5,330 tablets, 11,810 capsules and 55 injections. For the recovery of 7.896kg of charas, Naveen Jhalta, SHO of Solan police station, has been awarded the DGP disc.
 
 In an affidavit filed in the high court in October last year, the state DGP had submitted that at present approximately 400 villages were affected with illegal cultivation of cannabis in the districts of Kullu, Mandi, Chamba, Shimla and Sirmaur.
 
 According to report of zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) filed in the court, charas seizures increased from 2012 to 2015. In 2012, 282.370kg charas was seized in the state, whereas in 2013, it increased to 314.962kg. The NCB had seized 356.963kg charas in 2014. Though opium seizures have not been of more than 10kg, but in 2015, 283.446kg charas was seized from Himachal Pradesh.
 
 Himachal Pradesh high court in December last year had observed that as per reports, there was organized cultivation of cannabis in the higher reaches of Kullu district, subdivision of Kullu and   valley while there was wild growth of cannabis in Chamba, Kangra, upper Shimla and areas adjoining  . But the situation in Kullu-Manali Valley is alarming and despite sanction of considerable funds for destruction of illicit cannabis, little has changed, it said. 
 
 The court said the destruction campaigns were merely on paper and nothing had been done on the ground level by the NCB or state police for curbing the drug menace. It said though the situation in the entire state was quite alarming, but at present Malana village appeared to be the epicentre of the drug menace and immediate steps were required by agencies concerned. It wondered as to how rave parties were being allowed at Kasol village and whether foreign nationals residing in and around Malana possess valid permission from the government of India or were illegally staying there.
