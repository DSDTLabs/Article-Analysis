THANE: Even though the onset of summer has just begun, doctors from the city have already started getting cases of  , pollution-induced chronic coughs, senile lung diseases and so on.

  have pegged the rise in health ailments to the respirable and harmful air particles that is increasing because of the heat. Many have also complained of lack of appetite and other such issues due to the heat. Dr.  , a general practitioner who operates from Kalwa, said, “Over the last two weeks, we have been getting several cases of senile lung ailments wherein senior citizens, who are already low on immunity, have been breathing in polluted air particles. We have also been getting youngsters complaining of fungal infections and pollution-induced chronic coughs.”
 
 Meanwhile, doctors have chalked out some dos and don’ts for residents to beat the heat. From keeping immunity levels in check by being hydrated and having a balanced and healthy diet, to taking external precautions like wearing masks, appropriate UV resistant sunblock and fibre glass UV resistant sunglasses, doctors have urged residents to take every possible precaution to keep ailments at bay.
 
 “Students giving their exams have been losing their immunity because they avoid eating in stressful situations. As these youth and senior citizens are the most affected this season, they have to build their immunity by increasing the intake of vitamin-rich foods. Drinking a lot of room-temperature citrus-rich energy drinks or consuming fresh seasonal fruits will decrease the chances of dehydration as well as increase the nutrient level,” Dr. Banjan said. “Residents must also avoid stepping out in the afternoon and must try to cover their face and mouth with a mask or scarf. Using a cap or umbrella will also be beneficial. Wearing UV radiation resistant sunblock is essential to avoid skin rashes and burns,” added Dr.  , another city-based doctor.
