FEROZEPUR:   police have received a notice from the Punjab and Haryana high court, asking it to appear before it on January 10 with relevant records in a case registered against a person accused of giving shelter to gangsters   and Prema Lahoria.

 Accused Gurkirat Singh, a resident of Bukkan Khan Wala village, has been on the run since the registration of a case against him. His anticipatory bail was also rejected by the additional sessions court in Ferozepur following which Gurkirat had approached the high court.
 
 On October 24, 2017, a police party was on routine patrolling near   village in Ferozepur when an informer told the cops that Jarnail Singh and Gurkirat, residents of Bukkan Khan Wala; Harjinder Singh alias Vicky Gounder; Prem Singh alias Prema Lahoria; Gagandeep Singh alias Judge; Mandeep Kaur and Mandip Singh had formed a gang reportedly involved in extortion, snatching and other crimes in the area.
 
 The informer also said that Jarnail and Gurkirat had allegedly given shelter to Gounder and Lahoria. Acting on the information,   police registered a case against Jarnail and Gurkirat on October 24 and raided their possible hideouts.
 
 On getting information about the registration of a case against him, Gurkirat approached the local additional sessions court, seeking anticipatory bail citing political vendetta. The court had denied any relief to him following which Gurkirat had filed an anticipatory bail in the high court.
 
 Taking up his plea, a single bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill issued notices to the state government and the Ferozepur Police for January 10.
