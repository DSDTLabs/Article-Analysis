 Jethalal writes a note for Nattu kaka asking for an excuse. Nattu kaka replies to him saying that Jethalal has to lie to Babita as Iyer has already bought a phone for her. 
 
 Jethalal then tells Babita ji that there is no stock and then Bagga enters saying it is all false that there is a lot of stock of XYZ007. Bagga keeps insisting that there is enough stock in the shop but Jethalal handles the situation. 
 
 She asks him to get her one piece of the cell phone by evening. Babita wonders why is Jethalal lying to her. He apologises to Babita ji for not being able to help her. 
 
 Father of Tapu's friend comes over and asks for two pieces to which Jethalal says there is stock. Babita hears this and is shocked to find Jethalal lying to her. She gets angry and leaves the shop. Jethalal gets worried. 
 
 An angry Babita returns home, her mahila mandal is waiting for her. They ask for party from Babita for buying a new phone. Babita tells them that she is extremely hurt and says she did not get the mobile. She tells all of them that Jethalal did not give her the phone and says Iyer is right that Jethalal is a true businessman. 
 
 Anjali calls up Taarak to ask him what could be the reason why Jethalal refused to give mobile phone to Babita. Taarak calls up Jethalal to ask him the reason for making Babita angry. 
 
 Taarak says that there is something else to it but he cannot tell anybody what is the reason. Taarak asks Jethalal to reveal the truth to Babita.
