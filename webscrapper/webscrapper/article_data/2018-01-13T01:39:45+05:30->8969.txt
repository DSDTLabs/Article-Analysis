GURGAON: The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) has asked the Haryana government to submit a status report on deployment of a special task force (STF) in the environmentally sensitive Aravalis.

 The directive has come following complaints by environmentalists, demanding strict vigil in the Aravalis after a few traps were found in the protected areas in the first week of December last year.
 
 “I am directed... to request regional office, Chandigarh and the state government of Haryana to examine the matter and furnish a status report to this ministry at the earliest,” reads the letter written by the Union ministry to the principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana. The letter has been titled as ‘urgency for Aravali task force for patrolling’.
 
 Vinod Kumar, conservator of forest (wildlife), Gurgaon, said, “We will have a high-level meeting tomorrow (on Saturday) to discuss the issue. Also, since traps were found in the Aravalis, our staff have been patrolling the forests regularly at night. Many times, volunteers of   (AWBI) have been assisting our staff during night vigils. However, we haven’t found any traps after December 9.”
 
 According to environmentalists, more than half of Aravali protection watchers were laid off, several tents removed and check points were abandoned recently. “There was a system of local forest watchers that was put in place in Aravali areas of Gurgaon and   in past years. However, now we don’t see the tents and watchers even at some important entry/exit points in the Aravalis. It is disastrous for it is leading to poaching, encroachment and regular incidents of tree cutting,” said  , an environmentalist.
 
 The animal rights activists have been demanding more vigil in the Aravali, after a few traps were found there in the first week of December. They also met Union minister   on December 28 in New Delhi, raising a concern over shortage of forest guards.
