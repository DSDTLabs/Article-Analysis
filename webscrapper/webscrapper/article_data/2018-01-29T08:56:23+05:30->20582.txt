GAYA: Nearly 3,000 cops deployed for the monthlong stay of Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai   heaved a sigh of relief as he left Bodh   on Sunday morning ahead of his earlier scheduled departure for February 2. Before leaving for Delhi by a special flight, Dalai Lama offered prayers at the Mahabodhi temple.

 The total government expenditure on Dalai Lama's security including salary, allowances and logistical requirements of the cops is estimated to be about Rs 12 crore. Sources also say that normal policing including case investigation and law and order maintenance in Gaya and several neighbouring districts suffered on account of pre-occupation of police force for Dalai Lama's security.
 
 Contrary to expectations, the Dalai Lama's longest ever stay in   did not boost tourist footfalls. If hotel industry sources are to be believed, the footfall was even less than normal.
 
 According to tour operator  , “As against the normal occupancy rate being 70 to 80% in Bodh Gaya hotels in December-January, the occupancy rate fell down to 50-60% this tourist season.”
 
 Hotel industry sources also said that too much exposure of the Buddhist leader may prove counter productive for the hotel and hospitality business in Bodh Gaya. TNN
