Panaji: The 30mm of rainfall recorded in the state during the last 24 hours till Wednesday at 8.30am, turned out to be the wettest spell in a rather dry September so far.

 With the total seasonal rainfall now touching 2204.6mm, as against the normal of 2828.3mm, the deficit was reduced from 23% to 22% on Wednesday. A deficit or surplus within 19% is considered normal.
 
 With only just over a fortnight for the season to end, the chances of the deficit being wiped off in totality are remote. 
 
 The rainfall in the last 24 hours was attributed to an upper air cyclonic circulation over southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Kerala extending over Lakshadweep and neighbouring regions, which persists up to 2.1km above mean sea level. The trough from this system runs to the northeast Arabian Sea off the north Konkan coast and extends up to 0.9km above mean sea level.
 
 Among the centres, Sanguem received the heaviest rainfall of 54.5mm, Margao 48.2mm, Dabolim 40.4mm, Ponda 36.8mm, Valpoi 34.9mm, Canacona 29.0mm, Mormugao 24.8mm, Panaji 23.8mm, Old Goa 23.2mm, Sakhali 20.0mm, Quepem 17.0mm, Pernem 15.8mm and Mapusa 6.0mm. The state average was 30mm.
