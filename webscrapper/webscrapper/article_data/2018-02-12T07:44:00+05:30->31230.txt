LUDHIANA: A day after the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr Farooq Abdullah said India can wage war if Pakistan fails to stop terror, he advocated the need for a dialogue between the two countries.

 The Srinagar MP and senior National Conference leader said war only brings destruction and one can see that from the wars in Iraq,   etc. where even bridges didn’t stand and the industry was destroyed.
 
 The former chief minister, while addressing reporters at a golf course in   near here, asserted: “Kashmir is integral part of India and they (Pakistan) cannot take it. Pakistan is living in a fool’s paradise in thinking that it could ever capture Kashmir... Pakistan should better think of itself and its future rather than keeping an eye on Kashmir.”
 
 Condemning the attack on   camp in Jammu, the Srinagar MP said he has seen terror attacks throughout his life and those bring good to no one. He added that he wished a day comes when Saarc countries unite to grow.
 
  Conference leader said his party   was wrong to raise pro-Pakistan slogans in the assembly and should apologise immediately. “Fools could be found in every party. God knows what he had eaten up or consumed on that day. We cannot shoot him (the MLA), but will persuade him to apologise. We don’t agree with the slogans he raised.”
 
 He averred that the people from other states of country should welcome Kashmiri people and make them feel part of India.
