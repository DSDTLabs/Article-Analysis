HAMIRPUR: Maudha tehsil of Hamirpur constituency is known for its Muslim Rajputs, prosperous and arguably among the most influential community sub-groups in Bundelkhand. This election, they want to ensure their votes aren't wasted.

 "Most Muslim Rajputs, also known as Muslim Thakurs, are prosperous. The com munity has produced three IAS officers. Many are in the police or in good private jobs," Taj-ud-din, pradhan of Kamari ya village says. They are better educated and earn more than average Muslims in the area. "Our ancestors were Rajputs who converted to Islam during the Mughal period. Now we are an elite Muslim community ," the pradhan says.
 
 Among Bundelkhand's large Muslim population, these Thakurs have clout, though historians aren't certain if they resulted from mass conversions. "There's no record of mass conversions of Rajputs to Islam, apart from individual cases. Conversions happened in Moradabad, Rampur, elsewhere in the region," says historian Irfan Habib.
 
 This time, the Muslim Rajputs are trying to figure out the trends so that their votes are consolidated."It's disappointing that most parties haven't put up enough Muslim candidates.Muslims here have decided to back the candidate who's strongest," Taj-ud-din adds.
 
  admin-istration figures say there are 1.53 lakh voters t in Maudha tehsil, s of whom 48,000 are Muslim R Thakurs. In the tehsil's 12 major tehsil's 12 major villages, the com munity accounts for 75% of voters."We won't vote BJP . We have to find a strong alternative. Another party is getting considerable support from Brahmins here. We don't have a problem backing someone whom Brahmins will vote for," another pradhan says. "What bothers us is that politics lately has been about polarising voters," he adds.
 
 In 2012, after Maudha was merged with Hamirpur, then BJP candidate   won the poll by 7,824 votes.
