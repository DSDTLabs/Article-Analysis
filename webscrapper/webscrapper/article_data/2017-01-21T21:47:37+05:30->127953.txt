Thane: A 21-year-old student was duped by a 23-year-old youth who convinced her to   him by claiming that he is a manager and owns a house. 

 The police claimed that in October 2015, the victim got acquainted with accused Swapnil Waghmare as he would frequent the premises of the college she studied in. The girl, who was doing her second year of graduation from a Thane-based college, was approached by Waghmare. “In August 2016, Waghmare asked the girl to marry him, after which the student asked him whether he was employed and had a house of his own. The boy claimed that he worked in a clothes storeroom as a manager and showed her a building claiming he lived there. The two got married at a wedding hall and went to their respective homes,” said an officer from Thane Nagar police station. Waghmare then started giving vague excuses when the victim kept asking him to take her to his place. tnn
