GREATER NOIDA: The   Industrial Development Authority ( ) on Wednesday said it would carry out a two-day physical inspection of nine builders’ projects in its area, to reinforce its claim that they have diverted nearly Rs 1,000 crore collected from homebuyers, to other projects, delaying the delivery of flats. The aim is to establish if the builders have misused public money, and to ensure strict penal action including cancellation of allotments, officials said.

 YEIDA has completed the audit of accounts of 23 builder projects out of a total of 28 in its area, and found irregularities in nine projects, of which, five builders did not provide YEIDA with information it had sought. Even though YEIDA officials remained tight-lipped about the identity of the defaulting builders, sources said inconsistencies relate to nearly Rs 1,000 crore. 
 
 “We will carry out physical verification at the builders’ projects on January 11 and 12, to reinforce our findings that these nine builders have indeed diverted public money. Once we establish our findings, strict action is on the cards for these builders,” said a YEIDA official who did not wish to be named.
