With   just round the corner, the kolu dolls have started arriving in the city. And guess what is going to be new at kolu shops this year? Amma dolls! Along with the traditional goddesses that he makes every year, V Chinnadurai, an artisan from Srirangam, has come up with one-foot tall idols of former chief minister late   
this year.
 
 “Every year, I make kolu dolls of freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. This year, in remembrance of Amma, I am making her idols as well. Our family considers her as one among other goddesses. The Amma dolls have not made it to the market yet, but I am happy that these idols are gaining attention even before that,” says Chinnadurai.
 
 The dolls, made out of clay and paper wood, are priced at `1,200 (the one-foot one) and `700 (bust).
 
 Even though he is illiterate, nothing has stopped him from keeping himself updated about current affairs. “I have been following this practice for many years. When Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, I made his dolls for the next Navarathri. Similarly, I made Dr APJ   dolls, too,” says this doll-maker, who learnt this profession from his father. “I don’t consider this as just my profession, but as my passion and duty to continue what my father did. I will be more than happy if my son also continues this practice,” he adds.
