PATNA: BJP national president Amit   on Thursday held a meeting with members of the party’s   core committee in New Delhi to discuss the state unit’s preparedness for the 2019   elections.

 Shah is likely to visit the state in the first week of November. His interaction with the party’s Bihar brass has gained significance in view of the fact that the political air is thick with speculations that PM Narendra Modi is in favour of holding simultaneous parliamentary and assembly elections in the country. 
 
 “Shah would like to take feedback from the Bihar brass on holding simultaneous elections,” said a BJP source, adding if the central leadership favours it, it is but natural for the state unit to support the move. 
 
 This is Shah’s first meeting with the party’s Bihar functionaries after formation of the second   government in the state. JD(U) president and chief minister   had dumped Grand Alliance and returned to the NDA fold in July this year.
 
 Among those who met Shah on Thursday included deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, state president of the party Nityanand Rai, former state president and health minister Mangal Pandey, general secretary (organisation) Nagendra Ji and road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav.
 
 “Apart from the party’s preparedness for the Lok Sabha elections, Shah also discussed the state’s political situation with the Bihar leaders,” the source said, adding the strengths and weaknesses of NDA’s partners – JD(U), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP),   (RLSP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) – were also discussed at the meeting.
