NEW DELHI: Nearly five years after a head constable with   died under mysterious circumstances at his rented accommodation in  , a   has been registered under the instruction of a local court. A senior police officer said an FIR under Section 302 (murder) of IPC had been registered in the case. Head constable Ram Singh's body was found on December 8, 2013, with a bullet injury on the temple. Singh was left-handed. 

 Police had initially declared it as a case of suicide. Singh's widow, Sharda Devi, challenged the findings in the court. Singh was posted with the Dwarka (north) police station, which came in the jurisdiction of the erstwhile southwest district of Delhi Police. He was a native of Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan. Devi alleged that the investigation had not been conducted properly. She named two people whom she believed to be behind her husband's death. 
 
 Devi told the court that she had talked to her husband over the phone on the day of his death and he had shown no signs of stress or depression. She also argued that her husband had been off alcohol for at least three years before his death. The postmortem report also found no traces of alcohol in Singh's body, she told the court, countering the police theory. Police had found a glass and a liquor bottle from the crime scene.
 
 "If liquor was being consumed by someone in the room, there were more than one person, which further strengthens the suspicion that the deceased had not committed suicide, but was murdered under a conspiracy (sic)," Devi's statement read. The victim's family suspects a financial angle to the death. They claim that Singh was killed by a debtor.
 
 DCP (Dwarka) Shibesh Singh said the case was registered as per directives of the court and further legal action would be taken accordingly.
