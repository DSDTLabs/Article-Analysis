PUNE: Chief minister   on Wednesday said Pune was not the only city deserving good officers in administrative posts, implying that former Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited chief   had got a promotion and was not shunted to Nashik.

 “It is not just Pune which deserves to have good officers. (Tukaram) Mundhe has been posted as the new commissioner of the Nashik Municipal Corporation. In Pune, he was just handling the transportation affairs. Now, he will be looking after the entire municipal affairs, not just transport,” Fadnavis said, replying to a question about the people’s displeasure over Mundhe’s transfer.
 
 Fadnavis was in the city to inaugurate Symbhav, the annual cultural festival of Symbiosis Law School at  , near the airport. The dignitaries, including MP  , also inaugurated the renamed   — now the Symbiosis Road.
 
 In his speech, Fadnavis referred to the investment pledges at the investors’ summit in Mumbai over the weekend. He claimed that the state would become one of the few large sub-national economies by boosting the digital economy.
 
 “There are about 12 sub-national economies whose sizes are one trillion dollars or more. I believe that   has the potential to be one of those economies by 2025,” he said.
 
 Fadnavis touched on legal aspects in his speech. He said the spurt in economic and cyber offences required lawyers to be better equipped. “Today’s lawyers need to have the technical input in such cases as well. With mediations and arbitration increasing, we need a stream of credible lawyers and jurists,” said Fadnavis.
