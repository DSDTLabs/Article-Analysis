As per 2017 calendar, the board that governs 19,213   across the state had a provision for   to take 10 days' special leave. Madrassas were entitled to use it during Muharram,   or any other festival. Intimation on the decision taken on this provision had to be given to the board by the respective madrassa administration by April. 

 The 2018 calendar now allows four such special leaves, two of which can be sanctioned by the manager and the principal of a madrassa to its students. 
 
 These will be taken one day at a time, to a maximum of four days in a year.
 
 The same has to be informed to the respective district minority officer (DIO) by madrassas a week in advance. The calendar also states that on national festivals like Independence Day and Republic Day, while teaching will remain suspended, students, faculty, staff and madrassa administration will have to hold programmes scheduled for the day.
 
 Maulana   said, "Actions by both the Central government and state government are showing their anti-minority mentality. This constant grip on the madrassas by the board is revealing their mal-intention which is minority harassment."
