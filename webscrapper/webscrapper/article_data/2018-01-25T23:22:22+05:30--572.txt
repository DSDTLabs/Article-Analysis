Hyderabad: Bugged by the continued drug price erosion in the US, city-based homegrown giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories ( ) logged a 29% drop in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, at Rs 334.4 crore as against Rs 470.1 crore in the year ago period. 

 A one-time tax payment of Rs 93 crore in the US too impacted the overall net. “During Q3 FY18, the ‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017’ was approved and enacted in the US. Consequent to this enactment, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the US entity have been re-measured, resulting in a one-time charge of Rs 93 crore,” the company informed the bourses.
 
 DRL reported a dip in net profit despite a 3% rise in revenues during the quarter at Rs 3,806 crore as compared to Rs 3,706.5 crore in the same period of FY17.
 
 Commenting on the results, DRL CEO and co-chairman GV Prasad said, “We had a satisfactory third quarter performance with all key markets performing well. We recorded sequential revenue growth of 7% despite continuing challenges such as price erosion in the US. Our first-cycle NDA approval of Impoyz is a significant milestone in the commercialisation of our proprietary products pipeline. We will continue our focus on operational excellence and controlling of SG&A costs across the organisation.” 
 
 Segment wise, revenues from global generics dropped to Rs 3,010.5 crore during the third quarter of FY18 from Rs 3,063.8 crore in the third quarter of FY17.
 
 In the global generics segment, North America’s contribution decreased to Rs 1,607.3 crore from Rs 1,659.5 crore Y-O-Y, Europe’s revenues too dropped to Rs 200.6 crore from Rs 214.8 crore and, emerging market’s revenues fell to Rs 590 crore from Rs 595 crore. However, India continued to be a bright spot with generics revenues rising to Rs 612.6 crore from Rs 594.7 crore. PSAI revenues too rose marginally to Rs 543.6 crore as against Rs 540 crore.
 
 Speaking about the prospects of the Indian market, where DRL has been trying to adjust to the new GST regime, DRL COO Abhijit Mukherjee said, “The prescription growth for the company has been good and 10-12% growth is achievable in the Indian market.”
 
 On being asked if the company would look at expansion/acquiring assets in the US after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has led to reduction in corporate taxes, DRL CFO Saumen Chakraborty said, “There are some opportunities, we need to study in detail but it has become more attractive.”
 
 On drug launches, he said just like FY18, the company would look at around 10-15 drug launches in FY19.
