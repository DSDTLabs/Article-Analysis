The Sarabhais are coming back and we just cannot wait!
 
  The most epic show ' ' is all set to make its comeback after taking a 7-year leap.
  
  The iconic show went off air a decade ago but the memories are still fresh in every fan's head.
  
  
 
  
  Producer and actor   took to Facebook to hold a live session with their fans to re-introduce the characters to the audience before the show.
  
  
 
  
    (Maya),   (Indravadan),   (Monisha),   (Sahil) join the live video right from the sets of the new season. They were shooting a night sequence for the show when they were interrupted by Majethia and   (Roshesh).
  
  While the original cast remains the same, there is a new addition to the family, who will most likely play Sahil and Monisha's son in the series.
  
  The video showed us the location, the characters, and the camaraderie.
  
  
 
  
  Rajesh in Rosesh's style also recited few of his couplets for the audience. It went like:
  
  "Aaya Aaya Sarabhai family, phirse machane dhum. Sabki dhadkane karegi dhum dhum patt patt thoom. Purane namoono ke saath naye bhi honge sirf Hotstar par. Together they will fill the house aur house dikhega cute cute, golu golu jaise momma ka brocade blouse."
  
  The show will go on-air from May, 2017.
