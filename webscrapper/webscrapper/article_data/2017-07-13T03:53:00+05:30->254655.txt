Panaji: Newly appointed Goa Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho on Wednesday condemned the alleged assault by BJP vice president Anil Hoble on his daughter-in-law Sweta. The Congress came out in support of Sweta who was allegedly beaten up over dowry demands. “This is a shameful act by Hoble and his family to attack a woman over dowry. We condemn this act, it is a cheap act,” Coutinho said while formally taking charge of the state Mahila Congress unit. The Congress is likely to hold a protest march or meet the women’s commission over the incident to try and put the BJP on the backfoot. “We will support the woman,” Coutinho said. Coutinho also said that she would not shy away from hitting to the streets to protest against the BJP on issues that concern women.
