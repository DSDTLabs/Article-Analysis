MUMBAI:   has appointed ad hoc members in the boards of studies for different subjects bypassing the elected representatives. This means that teachers who will be setting the university question papers for the upcoming   will be appointed by ad hoc members in the boards in an “undemocratic” process. Teachers have alleged that the process raises serious doubts on the intentions of the authorities.

 In a letter addressed to the vice-chancellor of the university, Devanand Shinde, Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU), said “they are shocked to learn that the boards are different than the ones elected two weeks ago”.
 
 “…All the elected members are bypassed and parallel constitutional bodies are authorised by the university to decide upon the sensitive business of examination… This controversial step by the university is putting a question mark on the intentions of the administration…,” said the letter.
 
 A university source said that the university had appointed these ad hoc members about two months ago, much before the elections. The university failed to send the communication to the appointed teachers and the letters have reached now, after the elections, said the official. “Each of the board of studies needs to have about seven to eight members. While the elected representatives are there, the nominated members and ex officio members were not yet appointed yet. Since the boards were incomplete, the university had to go ahead with the ad-hoc boards,” said the official.
 
 A BUCTU member said that appointing all members should have been the university’s topmost priority. “How can they continue sensitive examination work with ad hoc members? For three years they have been doing it. The university has already had meetings with the ad hoc members,” said the BUCTU representative.
