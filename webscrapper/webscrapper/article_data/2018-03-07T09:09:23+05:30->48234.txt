PATIALA: Living up to the hype, javelin thrower   officially qualified on Tuesday for the Commonwealth Games after hurling the spear to a distance of 85.94m in his sixth attempt at the Federation Cup senior national athletics championships here. But it was an 18-year-old girl from Assam,  , who stole his thunder on the second day of competitions by booking her CWG berth with an excellent run of 51.97sec in the women’s 400m.

 
 The fact that Hima was participating in a 400m race for the very first time in her athletics career made the golden girl’s feat all the more impressive. Hima’s sensational effort that breached the CWG qualification mark of 52sec also saw her beat the likes of seasoned M R Poovamma, Jauna Murmu and Sneha PJ in the race. Hima, however, failed to break both the national records ( , 51.05s in 2004) and meet record (Nirmala Sheoran, 51.28s in 2017).
 
 Nonetheless, the athlete from Dhing town of Nagaon district was over the moon. “This will be my first CWG. My main event is 200m. Today was the first time I tried my hand at the 400m, that too, at a senior national level and I got selected. Prior to that, I competed in Chennai Open nationals and Indian GP, but in 200m. It’s an amazing feeling to qualify in your first attempt,” Hima told TOI.
 
 In the javelin throw, Neeraj deservedly took his CWG spot after breaching the AFI’s qualifying mark of 81.80m with a brilliant meet record throw of 85.94m. He had previously met the qualifying standard during the Indian GP, but the AFI had made it mandatory for athletes to match their performances at the Federation Cup.
 
 While Neeraj credited the recent training stint in Germany for his success and improved timing, javelin’s chief foreign coach Uwe Hohn wasn’t entirely pleased with his ward’s show and said the Haryana athlete is still a work in progress.
 
 The third athlete who qualified for the CWG was men’s shotputter Tajinder Pal Toor from Punjab in discus throw.
