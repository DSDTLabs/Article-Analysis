We have got some great businesses, whether it is in retail, small business or large corporate side, so we see no strategic advantage of any kind of acquisition and we certainly have not been approached by anyone. So I am surprised that Axis just seems to be getting hit with the whole lot of baseless   all the time no truth to it,” Shikha Sharma told ETNow.
 
 TOI had first followed up rumours of a possible merger of Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra on February 9. Most people TOI spoke to had said that an M&A is the most logical way for Kotak Bank’s promoters to bring down their stake.

Shares of Axis Bank opened at Rs 482 and rose to the day’s high of Rs 508 following a statement issued by the bank to stock exchanges at around 10.00am. The scrip finally closed at Rs 504.6.
 
 The possibility of a government disinvestment in Axis Bank has kept pressure on the bank’s share price from September 2016. The share price has also been affected by the rise in bad loans.
