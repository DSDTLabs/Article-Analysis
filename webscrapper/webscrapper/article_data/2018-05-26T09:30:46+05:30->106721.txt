MUZAFFARNAGAR: A 25-year-old woman who was bitten by a snake and unknowingly breastfed poisoned milk to her two-year-old daughter has died along with the child at Mandla village in   district. The toddler succumbed to the venom first.
 
  According to police, the incident took place around 4 am on Thursday morning when the woman, identified only as Parveen, had woken up for ‘sehri’. The family had bandaged the wound near her hand but did not seek medical help. Parveen breastfed the child after around two hours of being bitten by the reptile. The minor soon fell ill and was rushed to a hospital where she succumbed to the poison. A few hours later, the woman too collapsed and was declared brought dead by doctors.
  
  Salman Ahmed, the deceased woman’s brother-in-law, said, “Parveen was preparing food when the snake bit her. We had bandaged the wound. When she did not show any symptom of snake bite for more than two hours we had assumed that the reptile was of a non-venomous variety. She later removed the dressing and breastfed her daughter.”
  
  Family members said the minor had lost consciousness soon after she was fed. “When we brought our daughter’s body home, Parveen fainted and was taken to private hospital where doctors told us that she died from a snakebite,” said her husband, Sajid Ahmed.
  
  Vijay Singh, station house officer (SHO) of   police station, “We were informed by the hospital staff about the deaths. The family members have not filed any complaint in the matter. No autopsy of the bodies were done.”
