PATNA: Former deputy CM and senior   functionary   on Tuesday slammed chief minister   for raising the “baseless issue” of decommissioning of the Farakka barrage.

 Modi said the Centre has already formed a six-member committee for assessing the silt management in the Ganga under the influence of Farakka barrage. “The state government is not taking any step to stop construction of apartments and brick kilns on the riverbed of the Ganga, which are causing obstruction in the flow of the river. If Farakka barrage is leading to higher silt load in the Ganga, there should be proper study on it, but there is no point in decommissioning it. Nitish and Lalu Prasad should have raised the issue when they were Union ministers. The CM is raising baseless issues as he is not focused on development of the state,” said Modi. 
 
 Reiterating his demand for decommissioning of the Farakka barrage, Nitish had said on Monday that the barrage has been causing devastating floods in Bihar and West Bengal, almost every year. Farakka barrage was constructed in 1975 to divert water in the   river through a 38-km-long feeder canal to ensure smooth traffic of Kolkata Port.
 
 Speaking on the recurrent floods in the state, Modi said, “The total length of embankments in 1954 was 160km and the overall area affected by the floods was 25lakh hectare. The length of embankments in 2016 was 3,731km and the area affected by floods was 72.95 lakh hectare. It has been scientifically proved that excessive construction of embankments leads to floods, but the state government is still doing so. It should first correct its own actions.”
