HYDERABAD: The suicide of a 23-year-old Arjun Bharadwaj in Mumbai has put the spotlight back on the increasing number of student suicides in the city with psychiatrists saying how teenagers comprise majority of those who take the extreme step.

 Incidentally, Bharadwaj's suicide comes three days before this year's World Health Day (April 7), which focuses on depression as its theme. The   too, last week, declared depression is the leading cause of illhealth and disability .
 
 Linking it to rising cases of depression among the younger lot, they added it is one of the primary reasons why they commit suicide. “In Hyderabad, many engineering students tend to have psychotic symptoms or bipolar disorder, which leads to depression. It is not just pressure to perform better but also anxiety , bullying in educational institutions among other reasons that pushes many students into depression,“ said Dr Daljeet Kaur, consultant psychiatrist at  , adding that people who plan to take the drastic step often start showing signs like mood swings, difficulty in socialising or even over-socialising.
 
 As per the  's 2014 data, nearly 41 per cent suicides were committed by people between the age of 14 and 30.
 
 Experts attribute this unhealthy trend -unfortunately on the rise - 'stress of trying to fit in' among students. “I meet almost 10 students every week who complain of depression.Majority of them find themselves socially incapable and are constantly comparing their lives with that of others.This constant comparison often leads to depression,“ said Dr Praveen Chintapati, consultant psychiatrist at  .
 
 This is aggravated by the absence of a support system, said experts while listing out factors such as loneliness, failure in love, unemployment etc as other reasons for depression among students.
