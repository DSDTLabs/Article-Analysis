You could be a common man or even a police officer, but using a word like ‘Gujarat’ in your film will make you face the wrath of Central Board of Film Certification.

 The latest Bengali movie to face the same is ‘Aaleya’, directed by former IPS officer  . He has been advised by   to mute the word ‘Gujarat’ in the film. CBFC’s suggestion is certainly not a welcome note for the makers but still, Mr Kabir has said he will comply with CBFC’s suggestion to get a clearance.
 
 The censor board has reportedly advised for six modifications which include muting the word ‘Gujarat’ used twice, ‘Ahmedabad’, ‘Jai Shri Ram’, ‘Kafer’ and ‘Trishule gethe’.
 
 The film is about a senior police officer, who investigates the murder of   (played by  ).   will be seen as the top cop and the actress is not happy with CBFC’s decision. When we asked her about the same she said, “If films can’t highlight what’s happening in the society, then difficult days are coming for sure. The film has no scenes showing violence or gory. A Muslim is showing his anger at what brutalities happened in Gujarat riots. I think it’s normal to react in this way.”
 
 Director Humayun Kabir believes there is nothing wrong in his film. “Nothing is shown against any religion. The mention of the Gujarat riots is like what we say in general. That’s what I have shown in the film. I can assure there is no siding with any religion or any preference for any particular political party.”, he said
