MUMBAI: A BJP leader on Wednesday shot off a letter to the environment ministry and chief conservator of forest requesting them to file an FIR against the airport operator,   ( ), for illegally reclaiming a pond near  's Terminal 2.

 Activists released satellite images of the area where the pond was located. The 2000 image shows the pond in its actual size, while in the 2006 image, the area has shrunk. MIAL took over the operation of the airport in 2006. In an image taken this month, the pond has disappeared. NGO Watchdog Foundation said it had asked the ministry in April to take action against MIAL but no action was taken.
 
 MIAL has refuted the pond reclamation allegation. An MIAL spokesperson said, “When we were handed over the land, there was no pond. A pond behind Mirage Hotel is intact.“
 
 City BJP secretary  , who has written the letter, said the pond had been levelled using debris.
 
 Activist said MIAL is misleading people by saying the pond is intact on the other side. “There are two ponds in vicinity and only one is intact. The MIAL has reclaimed one behind  ,“ said   of Watchdog Foundation.
