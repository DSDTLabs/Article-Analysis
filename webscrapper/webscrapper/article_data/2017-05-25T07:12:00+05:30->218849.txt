LUDHIANA: Police have booked the former fiancé of a woman for uploading her objectionable pictures on a social networking site.

 The 23-year-old woman said in her police complaint, “I got engaged to the   resident about eight months ago. A few months later, my family and I called off the engagement. After two months, I tied the knot with a Ludhiana resident. But this did not go down well with my former fiancé. He created my fake profile on a social networking site and started sharing our courtship pictures. Every time he uploaded a photo or a post, he tagged my husband and me in. He would also send me lewd messages on phone or through the social site to strain the relations between my husband and me.”
 
 Investigating officer inspector Surinder Singh said, “Her former fiancé wanted to break her marriage. That’s why he created her fake profile and uploaded objectionable pictures and posts.” 
 
 A case under Section 294 (obscene acts and songs, whoever, to the annoyance of others) of the   and sections 66-E (punishment for violation of privacy) and 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act has been registered.
