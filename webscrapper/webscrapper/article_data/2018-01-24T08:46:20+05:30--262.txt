AMRITSAR: In an unprecedented decision, the   has decided to keep an eye on the ‘chal chalan’ (character) of Chief   (CKD) former president  , currently embroiled in a controversy over an objectionable video with a woman principal of one of the schools run under the CKD management.

 Chadha, who was summoned by the Akal Takht Jathedar, had appeared before the Sikh high priests at the Akal Takht secretariat on Tuesday along with his wife and other relatives to give his clarification about the incident.
 
 Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh said following the deliberations on Chadha’s case, they had decided to keep an eye on his character for two years during which, he said, that the Akal Takht had banned him from addressing any religious, social, political or academic functions. “After two years, he can submit his request with the Akal Takht which will then be considered accordingly,” he said.
 
 However, the Jathedar Akal Takht failed to inform about the mechanism by which the Akal Takht will keep a scanner on Chadha’s character for the next two years.
 
 An objectionable video of Chadha along with the woman had gone viral on December 26, 2017. Following that, one CKD member had lodged a complaint with the Akal Takht to summon Chadha and take religious action against him. On December 28, 2017, the Akal Takht had summoned Chadha to appear before the Sikh clergy.
 
 The Jathedar said the Akal Takht secretariat had also received complaints from Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC),   (AISSF) and other religious outfits against Chadha. He said the Sikh clerics had also directed the secretary of the CKD to accept his resignation and suspend him from the primary membership of the CKD.
