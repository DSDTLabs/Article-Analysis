SHIMLA:  ,   Kaul Singh Thakur said here on Tuesday that the   in the state was planning to introduce a scheme for providing, at  ,   up to 10 bighas to small and marginal farmers who have encroached upon public land.

 Thakur's statement came after he chaired a meeting of a state government panel that has been set up to assess and review encroachment cases. As part of the scheme that has been formulated, only farmers who possess land under 10 bighas would be eligible. Under the scheme, farmers will be given rights to the land in such a way that they end up owning 10 bighas of land.
 
 For example, if a farmer owns six bighas, he would be provided four bighas of land.Thakur said the scheme would be soon placed before the cabinet for approval.
 
 However, the state government would continue with taking action against big encroachers, he added.
 
 He said for gaining access to the rights, applicants will have to write to the sub-divisional officer of his or her area. Thakur said the government would also consider exchange of private land in lieu of encroached government land by farmers. He said that in cases where land would fall under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the state government would write to the Centre and take the case up sympathetically.
