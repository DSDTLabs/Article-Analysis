BUXAR/ARA: Chief minister (CM)   on Monday said incentives would be given to such district administrations which perform well in the   (ODF) programme and if a block is made ODF, the officials concerned will be rewarded. However he did not elaborate on the reward. 

 “A bigger reward will be bestowed on the officials if the whole district is made ODF,” said Nitish. He visited Rajpur in Buxar district and announced Kesath block ODF. With this 226 of 1984 wards in the district have become ODF. 
 
 “I want that by March 17 (district establishment day), the district should be made ODF and I promise that I will personally come and give the award,” said Nitish.
 
 Later in the day, he visited   under Kushuma panchayat in Bhojpur district as part of his ‘Nishchay Yatra’. Addressing a gathering at the village, the CM said by successfully implementing prohibition, Bihar has become a role model for other states. “We did not care about the loss in revenue due to prohibition. Welfare of people is our priority. Prohibition has brought a sea change in the lifestyle of the poor. I visited many hamlets, where poor women told me that in place of liquor, now their husbands bring vegetables from the market. People are spending money on sweets and clothes instead of liquor. Sale of garments in the state has increased by 44% and that of the sewing machine by 19%,” the CM said. 
 
 The CM added that by 2018, the state government will provide free electricity connection to every household. “Efforts are on to increase green coverage of the state from 9% to 15%,” he said. Nitish asked the officials concerned to expedite development projects in Bhojpur district. 
 
 Earlier, he inaugurated a herbal park at Shakhuan village and inspected the tap water supply scheme, concrete drains and roads, pig and cattle shed and electricity supply to 200 households of the village. The CM was accompanied by chief secretary  ,   and secretaries of different departments.
