PUNE/PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:  ,  , vibrant powders and a whole lot of laughter are here, marking the beginning of   celebrations. 

 Residents have been eagerly awaiting the two days of Holi celebration, which begins on Sunday. 
 
 Holi is traditionally associated with bonfires, or the burning of 'holika'. 
 
 On Sunday, communities, residential societies and groups of friends and family would gather across the city to create huge bonfires. They would assemble around the fire and pray for good fortune and also to ward off evil spirits. Each household would also offer a meal as tribute to the ceremonial fire.
 
 Many families also follow the custom where children go around the community collecting firewood and money, albeit symbolically.
 
 There's a lot in store for foodies with homemade sweets like puran poli, gujiyas, khurma and namak-paare satisfying their palate. Families begin preparations for these many days in advance. 
 
 On Monday, residential societies would organise Dhulwad celebrations, where people gather to play with colours. 
 
 While children play with water, colours, balloons and water-guns, the elders restrict themselves to natural and organic colours. Nowadays, many also make colours at home with natural ingredients like turmeric, beetroot and palash flowers.
 
 Special Holi parties are also organised, where colours, drinks, snacks and savouries abound. Holi-themed kitty parties have also been organised by several women's groups over the past week.With the festival during the weekend this year, many have planned elaborate celebrations. 
 
 Mugdha Kolhatkar, member of the cultural committee of her residential society, said, "A common Holika dahan will be organised in our society on Sunday evening after dark. We expect our members to step out early on Monday morning for Dhulwad and we have also organised thandai and snacks for all participants around midday."
