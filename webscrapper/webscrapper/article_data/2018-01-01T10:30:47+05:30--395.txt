PUNE: The Marketyard police arrested a 23-year-old man on Saturday night for abusing a traffic constable, when the latter had stopped him and his friends for triple-riding near Marketyard. The young man was also found to be under the influence of alcohol.

 On Saturday, at 8 pm, traffic police constable   and his colleagues were carrying out anti-drunken driving checks. “I spotted three men on a bike near   and stopped them. I then asked the rider, to produce his driver’s licence,”   said.
 
 “While he was looking for the license, I suspected that the men were under the influence of alcohol,” Kamble said and added that he asked the men to come to the police station. Instead, Shaikh, sitting third on the bike, got abusive. “The suspect, Wasim   of Ambedkarnagar, abused me. He grabbed me by my uniform,” Kamble told TOI. Along with another constable, Kamble then caught Shaikh and took him to the Marketyard police station. However, Shaikh’s friends fled the spot.
 
 “Shaikh said the police cannot stop and check them. He even said that the police did not have the authority to confiscate the motorcycle,” Kamble said. The constable said he was trying to explain that allowing an inebriated person to ride a motorcycle could be risky for the rider and the people on the road. “I even told Shaikh that I would give a notice to the rider and he can take his motorcycle back the next day,” Kamble said. However, Shaikh started abusing the cop and caught him by his uniform. “I took Shaikh into custody and took him to the police station,” Kamble said.
 
 Shaikh has been arrested under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC. Sub-inspector Rajendra Honrao is probing the case.
