VADODARA: Two weeks after   were stolen from a truck near Karjan, the police registered an offence following intervention of Vadodara (rural)   Saurabh Tolumbia.

 The theft took place sometime between February 27 night and February 28 morning after the truck broke down at Kandari on  . 
 
 The truck owner Mukesh Shah,. whose goods worth Rs 10.94 lakh were stolen, claimed that he went to Karjan   on February 28 morning to register the complaint but it was not taken by Karjan police inspector A B Saiyed. Shah also alleged that he went to the police station four to five times but the cops asked him to bring the truck driver along.
 
 When TOI contacted, Saiyed he said that Shah was verifying with the electronic company’s godown at Bhiwandi in Maharashtra about the goods being carried in the truck. 
 
 “Shah took time in verifying how much goods were lost so there was a delay in the registration of FIR,” said Saiyed.
 
 On Tuesday, Shah, finally, met Tolumbia and requested him to look into the incident. His complaint was eventually registered on Tuesday evening. 
 
 “The driver’s role is suspicious so the police inspector wanted to question him. But, he never turned up,” said Tolumbia. He added that Shah never mentioned to him that he had visited the police station several times for registering the complaint.
 
 Shah claimed that the thieves could have been nabbed early if the complaint was taken earlier. Police said that they want to interrogate the driver because the robbers cannot take away heavy electronic goods without his involvement.
 
 Shah stated in his complaint that when the driver went to sleep, thieves stole 13 washing machines and 37 indoor and outdoor units of air conditioners worth Rs 10.94 lakh.
