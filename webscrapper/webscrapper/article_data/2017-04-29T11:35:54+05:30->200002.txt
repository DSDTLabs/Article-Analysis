MUMBAI: The city   (EOW) on Friday arrested a  ,   (37), in a Rs 15 crore investment fraud wherein nearly 20,000 people lost their money. Manjrekar will be produced before the Esplanade court on Saturday. 

 Police said Manjrekar is the prime accused in the case and was wanted since 2014. Manjrekar was arrested after another accused in the case, Daniel Edward (45), a Kerala resident, was arrested last week and he shared the   man's location details during interrogation. 
 
 Edward, Manjrekar and their associates, Satish Pal and Manoj Pal, floated an investment scheme in 2013. "The accused promised the investors early returns, even before the end of the term," said an officer. Satish and Manoj were earlier arrested in this case. While Manoj is still behind bars, Satish was granted bail. The accused lured the investors saying they would re-invest the money in a big project and profits would be distributed amongst all the investors. 
 
 The accused had allegedly floated several schemes, said police. Majrekar promised Rs 1 lakh returns on an investment of Rs 3,500 and Rs 2 lakh on an investment of Rs 7,000 in two years. "He would introduce investors to promoters and would get a share of the firm's profit. He would also get a commission for new investors," said police.
