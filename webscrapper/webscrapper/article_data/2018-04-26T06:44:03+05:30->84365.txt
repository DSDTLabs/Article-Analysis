PUNE: The residents of   have decided to conduct a week-long road safety awareness drive in their area, in association with the traffic police, to make the area as no traffic   zone. 

 “There is a   committee meeting on Thursday at the ward office where we will decide on the dates,” said  , a resident. She said instead of putting the onus on traffic police, there is a need for individuals to follow traffic rules. “I keep floating messages about traffic rules in groups that I am part of and also in the society. I also stand up against wrong lane driving. Since I have started objecting to such violations, the cases have decreased. As educated people, we owe it to the society to stand up against traffic violators,” said Agrawal.
 
 Yogini Karmarkar, another resident of Baner Pashan Link Road, said it is shocking to see well-educated people working in big companies breaking traffic norms. “I see fashionably dressed people on good bikes riding on the footpath with impunity. What is the point of their education then if they can’t even understand that footpaths are for pedestrians?” she asked.
 
 Another resident   said the link road narrows towards the Pashan side and here the plight of senior citizens is even worse. “Despite heavy traffic and less space, people are seen speeding, or not allowing senior citizens to cross. Using a road isn’t a right, it is a privilege. If societies take a pledge to not violate rules, only then the situation can improve.”
