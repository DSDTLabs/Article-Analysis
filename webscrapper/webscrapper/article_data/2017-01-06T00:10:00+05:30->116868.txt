JAIPUR: The state higher education department is taking all precautions for the upcoming appointment of vice-chancellors in four-five varsities—the process in three universities—   (Sikar),   (Bharatpur) and   (Bikaner) is in advanced stage and process has started in both   and Rajasthan University of Health Science in Jaipur. The caution comes after the Rajasthan High Court slammed the appointment of Rajasthan University vice-chancellor J P Singhal over academic shortcomings causing embarrassment. The department is ensuring to complete the process in tune with the UGC guidelines to avoid any embarrassment further.

 The search committees of Sikar, Bharatpur and Bikaner have held the final meeting and submitted their recommendations to the governor. The names are likely to announce in the month end. “Certainly the incident has put the state higher education department and governor house in a spot. Reviewing the credentials of shortlisted candidates in these three universities cannot be ruled out,” said a senior officer of education department. The name of the appointed candidate will be announced in consultation with the state government.
 
 RU has nominated its nominee for the search committee for appointing the vice chancellor. The process has to be completed before the exit of Singhal who is due to retire in March 2017. The appointment of VC is a very rigorous process and requires deliberations for hours. Search committee members include four members on each appointed by governor, UGC, state government and the university. “The decision for the top post has become political rather based on the academic and administrative qualifications,” said education department source. Meanwhile, Governor Kalyan Singh who is likely to join the Rajbhawan on January 8 is going to take a call on the status of RU VC Singhal.
