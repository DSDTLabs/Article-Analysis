CHARMINAR: At first glance the narrow room with hardly any infrastructure doesn’t seem to be a school. But a closer look reveals that the government primary school at   near the   is in a pitiable state with only one room.

 One of the school teachers told TOI that they are forced to take classes (till Class V) in a single congested room for the last five years. Due to this, the dropout rates has gone up in recent times. Though there are around 50 children on the rolls, hardly 12-15 attend classes, owing to lack of space in the existing classroom.
 
 “There are very poor facilities for students in this school. Though the matter was brought to the notice of the authorities concerned so many times, we were asked to identify any land and construct a structure for the school in the same locality. Though we did our level best to find some land for a new building in this area, we failed. We have no option but to run the school under the current state of affairs,” clarified one of the teachers,  , who is on deputation.
 
 Students are forced to sit on the floor due to unavailability of benches. This apart, the foul smell emanating from the toilet attached to the room has affected the health of kids. “Due to the lack of basic facilities, parents have no interest in sending their children to this school,” another teacher said.
 
 Syed Khaja, whose three children study here, said that lack of basic facilities in the school upsets everyone. The parents have requested the education department to ensure a new building for this school immediately.
