CHENNAI: The Children's Park at   is back in business, drawing at least 7,000 visitors daily since it reopened four days ago. 

 The city's most affordable edutainment spot had to be closed on December 12 after Cyclone Vardah downed more than 250 trees, and damaged a few enclosures and the periphery wall in half a dozen places, said a wildlife department official.
 
 While a large portion of the fallen trees has been cleared and lot of debris dumped on the premises itself, some of the tree stumps have been converted into benches. "We decided to make them look good aesthetically," the official said.
 
 Some of the major repair work, such as rebuilding the periphery wall and renovating the damaged enclosures will, however, take some more time. "We will need at two more months to complete the work," he added.
 
 The situation at  , located behind the Children's Park, is much better with the fierce winds, often gusting up to 140kmph, leaving the stunted tree species, which account for majority of the trees on the premises, almost entirely unscathed, said the official. Only a couple trees had fallen and were almost immediately cleared.
 
 At the sprawling Vandalur zoo, 20km from the city, the damage was extensive. While the eucalyptus trees were taken away by the   at whose factory they will be converted into wood pulp before being made into paper, the others are being removed in phases. 
 
 The 602-hectare zoo has almost completely lost its green cover. "It may take at least another decade before we are able to restore it," he added.
