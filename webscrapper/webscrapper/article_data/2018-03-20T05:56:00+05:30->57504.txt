GREATER NOIDA: A 22-year-old   was found hanging from the ceiling of his room in the boys’ hostel of Skyline Institute of Engineering and Technology in Knowledge Park area on Monday.

 Pankaj Yadav, who had been staying in a room in the APJ Abdul Kalam hostel, left a suicide note saying he was “unhappy with his life” and did not wish to live.
 
 Pankaj was working at the institute for the past five years and stayed in a first-floor room meant for plumbers, guards and technicians. 
 
 The alleged suicide was noticed after he did not report for work till 10am and the other staff found his room locked from inside.
 
 GC Motwani, director (administration) of the institute, said Pankaj had to report for work at 9am every day. “The electricity supervisor called him three-four times but his phone remained unanswered. He grew suspicious and went to check himself. Pankaj did not respond to repeated knocks on the door. So, the police was called,” he said.
 
 The police arrived around 11am and found Pankaj hanging from the ceiling and the suicide note signed by him.
 
 Surender Singh Bhati, SHO, Knowledge Park, said: “He has said he was unhappy with his life and did not wish to live. He was unmarried and financial issues might be the reason behind his death. He seems to have been suffering from depression.”
 
 In another case, a 25-year-old man was found hanging from a neem tree near Bodaki railway station around noon. His body lay hanging from a sheet that covered his face, which led to suspicion that someone else might have hung him.
 
 Ramsen Singh, SHO, Dadri, said the body had been sent for postmortem.
