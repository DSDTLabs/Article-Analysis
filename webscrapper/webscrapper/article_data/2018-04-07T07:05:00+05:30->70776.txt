 Abhishek Yadav, a resident of Dharuhera in Rewari, saw a used iPhone 6S on sale on OLX on March 30. Interested, he called up the seller on the mobile number given in the advertisement, who identified himself as Vikram Vagmare. Vagmare agreed to sell him the iPhone for Rs 18,000, and sought payment in advance. After receiving the money, Vagmare promptly switched off his mobile number.
 
 Undeterred, Yadav started searching for the accused via his mobile number on social media, and eventually traced it to one Nandan Kumar Pandey on  . He sent a friend request to Pandey, but the account was deleted immediately. “I became friends with Pandey’s online friends and got to know that he works at an Apple store in Cyber Hub,” Yadav told police.
 
 After tracing the accused, Yadav took his uncle, a Gurugram police head constable, into confidence. Yadav then called cops.
 
 A police team soon reached the store and arrested the accused. An FIR was registered against Pandey after his arrest under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating) of IPC and Section 66D (punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource) of IT Act at Cyber Crime police station, Gurugram.
 
 “Pandey had somehow procured the Aadhaar card of Vikram Vagmare from the internet, and got a mobile number issued with it, on the basis of which he created the OLX and Paytm accounts used in the fraud. We are questioning him,” said Anand Yadav, SHO of Cyber Crime police station.
