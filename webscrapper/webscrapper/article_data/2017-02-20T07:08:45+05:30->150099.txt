CHARMINAR:   continues to face the problem of flexis and irregular signages despite orders being issued for their removal.
A drive along   will affirm this. While there is now much needed headway on the   (CPP), plans of installing uniform signage for shops along the heritage precinct still remains a pipe dream.
 
 Owners of business establishments continue to install large, garish flexis.
 
 Only a few dozen have put up signages with dimensions as prescribed by GHMC. “Around 65 shops have displayed correct signboards. Many have not adhered to Charminar Pedestrianisation Project guidelines. Moreover, it is the   which is also at fault as they are supposed to supply the signage. This has not happened.
 
 The civic body should take into confidence these shopkeepers,“ said a proprietor of a business establishment. The skyline at Charminar Shalibands stretch narrates a similar tale .
