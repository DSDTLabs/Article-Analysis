New Delhi: The government is confident of raising Rs 45,000-50,000 crore from stake sales in state-run firms in 2016-17, and has already drawn up plans to ensure that it inches closer to the target, a senior government official said. This would be the highest amount raised from stake sales in state-run enterprises in a single year since the process was started in 1991-92. 

 “We will reach very close to the target. It would be closer to Rs 50,000 crore,” a senior government official told TOI. He said that at least two   are expected in the current year. Strategic sales will result in the government reducing its holding below 50% or selling all shares in the company along with management control to a private entity. “We have already covered a significant ground and we have a plan to reach the target,” the official said without elaborating.
 
 The Centre had set a target of raising Rs 56,500 crore from stake sale in state-run companies in the current fiscal year. This was lower than the Rs 69,500 crore target set for the previous year. Out of the Rs 56,500 crore target for 2016-17, Rs 36,000 was to be raised from minority stake sales, and Rs 20,500 crore from strategic stake sales.
 
 So far, the government has raised Rs 23,528.7 crore, which includes Rs 21,432.4 crore through minority stake sale in 14 state firms, and Rs 2,096.3 crore through strategic disinvestment. The total realisation of Rs 21,432.4 crore by November 2016 through CPSEs’   receipts, constitutes around 60% of the budgeted target of Rs 36,000 crore to be raised from minority stake sales.
 
 The government has taken its time to roll out the stake sale programme.  , the government think tank tasked to identify companies for disinvestment, has made a case for strategic sale in several public sector companies. In September, the Centre approved a strategic sale in loss-making Bharat Pumps and Compressors. It comes 12 years after a state-run company — Jessop & Co — was last sold through this route. Last week, the government approved a 26% strategic stake sale in BEML.
