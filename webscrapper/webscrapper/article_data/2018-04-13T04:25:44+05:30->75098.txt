NAVI MUMBAI: A fortnight after a no-trust motion moved by the ruling BJP was passed against him, the state on Thursday suspended the resolution against   (PCMC) chief  . A government resolution in this regard has been issued by the urban development department. 

 On March 26, a special general body meeting presided over by   mayor   passed a resolution against Shinde under the Maharashtra Municipal Act, levelling a series of allegations against the officer. The no-trust motion was passed with 50 votes in favour and 22 against. Its rejection is being seen as CM Devendra Fadnavis’s act of backing Shinde. “I am relieved and I express my gratitude to citizens for reposing faith in me and extending moral support. I will continue to serve them with even more energy,” Shinde told TOI. 
 
 The GR says the mayor and PCMC secretary can make their submissions within 30 days. As the resolution stands rejected, Shinde will continue as PCMC commissioner. The decision is being viewed as a political setback for the local BJP unit. The contention of the corporators was that while the civic chief had delivered, he had scant respect for elected representatives. Soon after Shinde took over in 2016, he took action against encroachments, illegal hawkers and hotels. Mayor Kavita Choutmal said, “I have not seen the government directive. I can only comment after receiving it.”
