In a year that is seeing some really big clashes at the box office, there is one date that was not touched and kept away from.

  
  
 it is the release date of the sequel of  ' ' ', which is April 28.
 Directed by SS Rajamouli, 'Baahubali - The conclusion' remains one of the most awaited films right from the first part of the film released.
 
 Prabhas' film did not just break records and receive immense love and appreciation from the audiences, but also had them waiting for such a long time for the sequel, which was pre-announced.
 
 Hence, in a year when  's 'Raees' is clashing with  's 'Kaabil';  's 'Tiger Zinda Hai' is clashing with  's Sanjayb Dutt biopic and Shah Rukh's 'The Ring' is clashing with  's 'Crack', only this flick stands alone.
 Looks like Prabhas is all set to create new records with 'Baahubali- the Conclusion.'
