 According to data provided by the UP DGP's office, 142 wanted or criminals with rewards on their heads have surrendered either within the state or outside.

 "If they (criminals) are trying to go back to jails, we do not mind that because jail is only their rightful place and not outside," UP DGP OP Singh told TOI on Saturday. "The results (of the crackdown) have been unprecedentedâ€¦ never in the past has this kind of straight message conveyed to the criminals so clearly. They will not be allowed to play havoc with the lives of common citizens," he said.
 
 Police chiefs have been asked to prepare dossiers of all those on whom either rewards have been announced or are at large, the DGP said. "We have launched a multi-pronged attack. The number of goons against whom Gangster Act has been invoked is also biggest so far." Maange alias Vinay, main accused in a double murder case in  , surrendered on February 2. Sources said a massive manhunt had scared Maange who feared he would be killed in an encounter.
