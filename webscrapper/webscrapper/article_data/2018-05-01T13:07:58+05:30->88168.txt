PATNA: Four-and-a-half years after he pleaded for tearing up the UPA government’s Ordinance in 2013 leading to disqualification of RJD chief   Prasad from the Lok Sabha due to his conviction in a fodder scam case,   president   on Monday called on the former Bihar CM at the AIIMS in Delhi and inquired about his health.

 Lalu has since been convicted in three more fodder scam cases and was lodged in a Ranchi jail to serve the jail term awarded to him. He was taken to Delhi by train and admitted to the AIIMS on March 29 after he complained of uneasiness. He was discharged on Monday evening.
 
 Rahul met Lalu in the morning. “It was a courtesy visit. After all, Lalu-led RJD is an ally of UPA,” a Congress functionary said in  .
 
 However, the meeting prompted Bihar’s ruling JD (U) to ask Rahul why he had then rejected the UPA government’s Ordinance meant to protect convicted lawmakers. “Rahul should explain his stand,” JD (U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar told TOI. 
 
 Taking a dig at Rahul over his meeting with Lalu, Neeraj said the Congress president should also visit Tihar central jail and meet convicted RJD leader Mohd Shahabuddin.
 
 While pleading to tear up the Ordinance, the then Congress vice-president had on September 27, 2013 also slammed the then Manmohan Singh-led government for bringing the Ordinance. “I tell you what my opinion on the Ordinance is: It is complete nonsense. It should be torn up and thrown away,” Rahul had told media persons in Delhi.
 
 Following Rahul’s public outburst, the Union Cabinet on October 2, 2013, decided to withdraw the Ordinance which led to disqualification of Lalu on October 21, 2013.
 
 Lalu and JD (U) MP Jagdish Sharma were the first two Lok Sabha members to be disqualified after the Supreme Court struck down a provision in the Representation of People’s Act that would protect convicted lawmakers.
