AGRA: Can   declare the 2017-18 results by June 15 as announced earlier? The question is doing the rounds as practical exams are yet to be conducted at round 500 self-finance colleges affiliated with the university. It has been one month since the main theory exam concluded but practical exams are yet to be conducted in these colleges.
 
  A case in point is the B.Sc (agriculture) course — university has so far managed to declare around 5% of results whereas case of more than 89,000 agriculture students is still hanging fire. The practical exams of these students are yet to be held.
  
  The university had first planned to complete the practical exams before the main exams started. In January, it had said it would conduct practical exams from January 8 to February 7 for undergraduate courses and from February 8 to 15 for post-graduate courses. The plan, however, was implemented in just half a dozen colleges out of the 1,000 colleges affiliated to the university.
  
  This year, the final exams commenced on March 7 and ended on April 27. Teachers are busy evaluating answersheets even as the practical exam process is pending in around 500 colleges. Out of the total 595 affiliated colleges with B.Sc (agriculture) course, the results of the subject has been of declared in only 23 institutes so far.
  
  University’s public relation officer GS   said, “Results of some of the self-financed colleges has not been declared as they have either not submitted the exam fee or haven’t provided the details sought by the university administration.”
  
 Sharma added, “Colleges have been asked to coordinate with examiners and conduct pending practical exams as soon as possible. In case required, university administration will conduct practical exams at the nodal centrse. Declaration of results will not be delayed.”
