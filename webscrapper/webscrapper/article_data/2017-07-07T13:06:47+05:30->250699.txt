The mantra of ‘Less is more’ is now not just limited to make-up, accessories and clothing. The rule applies to tattoos, too, and people are ensuring that these subtle tats create a huge impact.

 
 Many girls opt for mini-tattoos as an additional accessory. So how about a tiny, girly bow, gal? Tattoo artist  , says, “Women usually opt for mini-tattoos to accentuate individual elegance. If drawn in a thin line, a bow works wonders! Many women are opting for a pink bow or ribbon for causes like breast cancer awareness.”
 
 
 Going down on your knee to pop the question with a solitaire is passé. Couples are choosing tattoos instead of expensive engagement rings. Do away with the diamonds, you! Celtic knots, infinity symbol, ambigram and lovers’ all-time-favourite, heart designs are a hit! “Many get a diamond tattoo on the ring finger. With these kinds of tattoos, you don’t even have to worry about the diamond falling out or ever losing the ring. Better yet, it just looks cool. So, it’s a win-win!” adds Vikas.
