NEW DELHI:   ( ) told the   on Friday that it had decided against renewing licence to Tata groupâ€™s Indian Hotels Company Ltd to manage the iconic   in the capital and the property would be auctioned.

 Appearing before a bench of Justices P C Ghose and R F Nariman, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain informed the bench that the civic body had taken a final decision to auction the property.
 
 NDMC took the decision after the SC, during the last hearing in January, asked it to review its earlier decision to auction the property in the light of opinion given by the attorney general and the solicitor general who had recommended against auction.
 
 Jain said that the civic body was ready to do e-auction but would wait for the final outcome of the case. The court then posted the case for hearing on March 22. The law officers suggested the NDMC to negotiate with the Tata group to fetch market price for granting lease to the company to run the hotel and opined against putting the property under the hammer.
 
 The agreement expired in 2011 and NDMC decided to auction the property, hoping to fetch a better price for granting the lease of the property. The company then approached the HC which dismissed its plea in October and allowed the civic body to auction the property.
