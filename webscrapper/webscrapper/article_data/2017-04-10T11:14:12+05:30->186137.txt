PANAJI: Highlighting the speed of work of various infrastructure expansion projects in the railways currently undertaken by his ministry, Union minister for railways,   said that the reach of electrification of broad gauge lines would be doubled in the next five years.

 “This year, we have done record electrification and record lying of new lines. We have already sanctioned doubling of tracks for 12,500kms, which is almost the same amount of doubling done in the previous 75 years. We have installed as many bio-toilets in trains in one year as was done in the previous six years. Currently, only 42% of the railway lines are electrified. In the next five years, we plan to double the reach. Barring narrow gauge and metre gauge, all lines will be electrified. As and when we convert the narrow and meter gauge lines, they will be electrified as well,” said Prabhu on Sunday at Panaji, launching various infrastructure-related initiatives of   in Maharashtra and Karnataka. 
 
 Prabhu said that the ministry is now working on creating financial resources outside the budget provisions made to them by the government, by partnering with financial institutions.
 
 “We started upon a new system of financing railways infrastructure by raising resources outside the budget. For this year as well, Rs66,000cr is coming from outside the budget. Railways has long been waiting for a Santa Claus and unfortunately he did not find us as a very attractive child and thus, we have suffered,” he said. 
 
 The minister informed that railways were given a credit of Rs1.5 lakh crores by the   (LIC) for 30 years tenure.
