NAVI MUMBAI: A 35-year-old engineer working as a manager for a   company electrocuted himself at his office on Saturday, said the police on Monday. The deceased was identified as Deepak Revankar, a resident of   working with Microdata Marine Group, which has its office in the   complex. API Raju Pathan said Revankar had emailed his seniors that he was disturbed as he had not been paid his salary, but company officials said all salaries had been paid. 

 “Revankar worked as a ship designing manager,” Pathan said. “On Saturday, he was alone at the office, where he allegedly wound copper wires around his neck and hands and plugged the other end of the wire to the electricity board and switched it on.”
