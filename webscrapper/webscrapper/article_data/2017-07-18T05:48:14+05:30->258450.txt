NEW DELHI: Metro commuters had a tough time during Monday evening peak hour as a technical snag affected train operations on  's   (  ­ HUDA City Centre).

 A snag in the Overhead Equipment (OHE), part of the Metro's electrification system, led to trains running painfully slow on the corridor.
 
 “Train services on Yellow Line have been affected between Jahangirpuri and Vishwavidyalaya section due to some OHE problem on the down line (going towards Gurgaon) since 7.50 pm,“ said a Delhi Metro spokesperson. As the line going towards Gurgaon was closed, the `up line' towards Samaypur Badli was being used for both up and down train operations, which lead to the delays.
 
 “Necessary OHE repair work is being undertaken and normalcy is likely to be restored shortly,“ the spokesperson added.
