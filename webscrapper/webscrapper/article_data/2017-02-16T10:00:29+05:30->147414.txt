KOLKATA: Life came to a virtual standstill in central Kolkata even as a Congress rally left traffic in knots and shop owners downed shutters to protest against “threats“ allegedly issued by Syed Muhammad Nurur Rahman Barkati, Shahi Imam of   Mosque. 

 Shop owners alleged that they had been being harassed ever since they wrote to the Mutwali of the Tipu Sulta mosque,  , against a fatwa issued by the Imam against Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi last January. All shops and hawkers in the area stayed away from business on Wednesday .
 
 The shop owners, who offer prayers at the mosque, alleged that the mosque was being used for political purposes by  .
 
 “Last month, he had issued an edict against Modi over the demonetisation issue and announced a cash award of Rs 25 lakh. This has disturbed the communal harmony . Earlier, he had done it against   too. This upset us and we had approached the Mutwali of Tipu Sultan mosque, Prince  , who wrote a letter asking him, not to disturb the sanctity of the mosque. He asked him to ensure that it was not used for political reasons,“ a shopkeeper said.
 
 The Mutwali had even tried to prevent the Imam from holding a press conference last Friday. The shopkeepers informed the matter to the DC (central) and Bowbazar police.
 
 Mutwali Shah said, “On February 10, before the Friday prayer, I had gone to the Imam, asking him not to hold a press conference. Even as he was readying for it in the mosque, his son Khaled attacked me. But I was saved by the local men who were in the mosque and some shopkeepers. I was admitted to Medical College and Hospital and am still undergoing treatment at a nursing home.“ He alleged that what the Imam was doing tarnished the image of Muslims in the community. “If any Muslim youth tries to blacken the face of Modi following Imam Barkati's fatwa, what would have happened to that youth?“ Shah said.
 
 Imam Barkati, however, denied the allegations. He said that this was a ploy by the BJP to humiliate him.
