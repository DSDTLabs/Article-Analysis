CHENNAI:   aficionados were in for a pleasant surprise over the weekend to find the fruit selling at much lower prices than at the onset of the season.

 Fruit vendors said better quality mangoes have started arriving in the market leading to a glut which in turn has caused prices to slump. “Last week, I was selling the   variety at Rs 150/kg but now it is available at Rs 100/kg or lower,” said Kumaran, a vendor. Homemaker D Uttara was elated to buy a kilo of Banganapalle for Rs 80/kg from a roadside vendor.
 
 Traders said as the summer season has intensified, the quality and amount of produce entering the market has improved and they are forced to sell at lower prices.
 
 “On some days, the number of mangoes received at   peaks at 100 tons. On such days, we have to push all our fruits to sellers at lower prices as the   are not adequate,” N Srinivasan of the   said.
 
 He added that there is a constant fear of a crackdown by food safety department on the use of artificial means to ripen mangoes which has led to traders selling away whatever produce they have received from suppliers. 
 
 Traders said they expected help from the government to set up cold storage facilities. “The government has been talking about helping us for the past four years but has done nothing,” said Srinivasan.
