THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Human rights activist Irom Chanu Sharmila, who is on a short visit to  , met chief minister  , administrative reforms committee chairman   and CPM state secretary   here on Monday.

 Talking to reporters later at a ‘meet the press’, Sharmila said that Vijayan had offered her all support for her fight to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). “I am more hopeful as the whole of Kerala seems to be with me in my cause,” she said.
 
 On her future plans, Sharmila said she would lobby the whole world against the draconian law. However, she added that she would not venture into politics anymore.
 
 On her recent poll debacle, Sharmila said that it was an open secret that money and muscle power define electoral politics in India. “I expected people to believe in me. If they did, I could have taken the role of a parent,” she said.
 
 “If people don’t want me in politics, let it be,” she said about getting just 90 votes against Congress candidate and former CM Okram Ibobi Singh.
 
 Sharmila said that she was overwhelmed by the response of people in the state. “I met a lot of people from school children to social activists. Kerala has a high literacy rate and people are socially conscious. Real democracy will survive only in such an environment,” she said.
