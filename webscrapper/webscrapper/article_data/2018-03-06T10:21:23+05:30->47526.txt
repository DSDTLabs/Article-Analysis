HYDERABAD: TRS Rajya Sabha MP K   is in the limelight again. According to TRS sources, Keshava Rao is aiding CM K   in garnering national support using his contacts as he had worked as AICC in-charge of Jharkhand and West Bengal before joining the TRS. 

 A day after KCR announced that he would take a lead role in the formation of the third front ahead of the 2019 polls,   chief Mamata Banerjee and former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren called up KCR and extended their support. 
 
 According to TRS sources, Keshava Rao played a vital role in talking to the two leaders and the latter extending their support for the anti-BJP and anti-Congress Front. Mamata had reportedly told KCR that she would be working with him in bringing like-minded parties together.
 
 When Keshava Rao joined the TRS in 2013, he was made party general secretary and became party number 2 by heading the national affairs committee. However, his role drastically came down after the formation of Telangana.
 
 Recently, Keshava Rao's family figured in the Miyapur land scam. However, he denied any wrongdoing by his family members and said the property was purchased after legal advice and to avoid further controversy, he claimed he cancelled the deal. In the past few days, Keshava Rao has been visibly seen besides KCR during his meetings regarding the national front.
 
 According to TRS MLA Srinivas Goud, "KCR is our supreme leader. He and the party will make all leaders work for the party as per the requirement. Keshava Rao is the leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, and the party will be using his experience and connections as he worked in two states as in charge earlier in the Congress."
