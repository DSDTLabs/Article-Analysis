AHMEDABAD: A fisherman from   in  , apprehended by   (PMSA), died in   on July 10. His family now waits for the body of the sole breadwinner of eight. They can neither tweet to minister of external affairs (MEA) Sushma Swaraj nor can they approach a government representative about the issue.

  
  The deceased, Kana Lakhman Chauhan (42), was apprehended by the Pakistani security agency in March while at sea. According to his family members, they got news of Chauhan’s death through his brother-in-law, Kanji Vala, who was also held by PMSA personnel and taken to Karachi jail.
 
 Chauhan left behind his elderly parents, wife, three daughters and two sons.
 
  
  Huka Chauhan, his younger brother, said that they did not get any official word from the government about Kana’s death, only a hand-written letter from their brother-in-law. “Pakistan had recently released a few fishermen from Una. One of them showed me a letter written by our brother-in-law, Kanjibhai, stating that my elder brother died of a heart attack in Karachi jail. The government did not even inform us about his death. Now, the (Union) government should at least start the procedure to bring his body back,” Huka said.He further said that the family of eight now depends on Kana’s wife, Jeeviben, who earn a meagre Rs 100 per day as an agricultural labourer.
 
 Kamlesh Solanki, sarpanch of the village, said that the family’s financial condition is deteriorating as they have lost their principal breadwinner. The government should intervene and start negotiations with Pakistan to bring his body back.
