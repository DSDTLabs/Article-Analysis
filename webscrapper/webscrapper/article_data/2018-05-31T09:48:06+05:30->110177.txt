VADODARA: Students who have been issued leaving certificates (LCs) by private schools across the state over non-payment of fees by their parents or some other grounds might get some relief soon. 

 
 
 
 The   State Commission for   ( ) has decided to intervene in the matter and ensure that private schools which have issued such LCs to students revoke the LCs and re-instate the students. 
 
 The state child rights panel took this decision after its hearings on the issue got over on Tuesday. 
 
 “We have come to the conclusion that schools cannot issue such LCs to students. We will be now holding meeting with respective district education officers, the district primary education officers and social justice department officials to resolve the issue,” Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of the state child rights’ panel confirmed while talking to TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 “The actions will be taken within a week so that the issue gets resolved before the schools re-open and children are re-admitted in their classes,” she said. 
 
 Affected parents, parents associations and legal advisors to the commission were present during Tuesday’s hearing after which the commission arrived at the decision. 
 
 “The commission has taken a tough stand and assured us that the school managements will be directed to revoke the LCs issued to students,” said Kishore Pillai, advocate and spokesperson of   (VPA). 
 
 “Various provisions of the juvenile justice act are likely to be invoked through DEOs against these school managements. It will be for the first time in Gujarat that provisions of the act will be invoked for re-instating students,” he said. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that VPA has been making representations at various levels to get nearly 16 students who have been issued LCs by four private schools revoked since more than a month.
