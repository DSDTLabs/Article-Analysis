NEW DELHI:   which were granted subsidised land by the Delhi Development Authority(DDA) in the national capital would not be able to hike fees without approval from the government, the   said on Monday. 

 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud refused to interfere with the order of the Delhi High Court which had in January last year held that the schools were bound to seek approval from the directorate of education before increasing fees.
 
  The high court had held that schools, which were granted land at cheaper rates by DDA, cannot indulge in profiteering and commercialisation of education by increasing fees on their own and directed that prior approval from the directorate of education was a must before taking any such decision. 
 
 "Quantum of fees to be charged by unaided schools is subject to regulation by DoE... under the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 and it is competent to interfere if the fee hike by a particular school is found to be excessive and perceived as indulging in profiteering," the HC had said.
 
  The HC had passed the order on a petition filed by an NGO, Justice for All, which contended that there were close to 400 private unaided schools which had been allotted government land in the city. The list includes Modern School (Barakhambha), DPS (RK Puram), Air Force Bal Bharti School (Lodhi Road), Amity International School (Saket), Sanskriti School (Chanakyapuri), Mirambika Free Progress School (Sri Aurobindo Ashram), Convent of Jesus and Mary (Bangla Sahib Marg), Ryan International School (Mayur Vihar) and Ahlcon International School (Patparganj). 
 
 Action Committee Unaided Recognized  , an association of schools, then approached the Supreme Court against the HC order.
