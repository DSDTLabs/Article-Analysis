BENGALURU: Homeboy   seemed to have reserved his best for the last as he decimated first-time finalist   5-0 en route to his ninth National billiards crown in the 85th edition of the premier championship here on Monday. Barring a couple of chances he gave his young rival in the fifth frame of the best-of-nine finale, Advani was in a different league. In his first maiden senior title at home, he treated the big crowd to a brilliant exhibition of billiards.

 The green baize baron, owner of 13 world billiards titles, became the first cueist to win the Nationals without dropping a frame since the points format was introduced in 2008. Another Karnataka cueist,  , was the first to have won the snooker title without dropping a frame six decades ago.
