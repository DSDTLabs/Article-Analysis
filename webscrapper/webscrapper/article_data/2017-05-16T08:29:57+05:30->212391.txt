GUWAHATI: A local court on Monday allowed   to quiz notorious drug kingpin   alias Pakhi Miyan at central jail here. The court however has denied   of Miyan. 

 Police had sought five days' remand to unearth his involvement in the sensational GS Road jewellery shop robbery. Cops suspected that the arms used in the robbery were provided by Miyan, who was out on bail.
 
 Denying the charges, he said he was falsely implicated in the robbery case as part of a larger conspiracy. He was arrested on Friday night along with an accomplice from the city.
 
 However, even a week after four armed-masked robbers looted a prestigious jewellery shop at the busy GS road, police are yet to crack the case.
