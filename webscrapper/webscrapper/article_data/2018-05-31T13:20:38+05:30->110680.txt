PUNE: The city-based Nagrik Chetna Manch ( ) has written a letter to the Union transport minister, Nitin  , drawing his attention to the haphazard implementation of the Bus Rapid Transit System ( ) on the city's vital roads and has sought his intervention to improve the same.

 Qaneez Sukhrani of the NCM and citizen member of the BRTS route service and maintenance committee, said the NCM is dissatisfied with the way the BRTS pilot project and phase I corridors have been executed and implemented without having a Detailed Project Report (DPR) and associated reports in place. Despite having had public funds of Rs1500 crore, the civic administration did not spend it for the construction of infrastructure that was required as per concept and features of a standard global BRTS to promote public transport.
 
 Sukhrani said Pune was one of the only important cities in the country that does not have a competent and efficient public transport system. 
 
 The major issues highlighted by the NCM include the installation of RFID sensor activated electronic gates to remove human intervention, repair and maintenance of automatic doors, installation of CCTVs on all horizontal signal systems to capture vehicle violations, cleaning of bus shelters on a daily basis, zebra and pedestrian crossing with durable paints and repairing of gaps in the railing.
 
 The organization has also pointed out that construction of the BRTS terminal at Wagholi has not started yet. Commuters and staff have to stand in filthy conditions, it said.
