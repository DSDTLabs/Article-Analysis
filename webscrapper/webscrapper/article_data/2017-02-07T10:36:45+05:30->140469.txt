 A symposium was organized by   at Shrimant Baburao Dhanwate Hall, Shankar Nagar. The topic of discussion was ‘Paramparik jokhadatun mukt jhaleli stree’. Pujari, who was one of the keynote speakers, said, “The works of great social workers like Jyotiba Phule, Ramabai Ranade and many more were the stepping stone for the new generation women to become independent in every field.” 
 
 Balwant Bhoyar, a researcher and writer, said that traditional shackles have not been completely broken as yet. “Women in rural areas are still suffering due to old customs and traditions. But many women are standing against ill-treatment,” Bhoyar said. He stressed that people should read ‘Lajja’, a book written by Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen. Globalization has played an important role in breaking social barriers that came in the way of women finding new horizons.
