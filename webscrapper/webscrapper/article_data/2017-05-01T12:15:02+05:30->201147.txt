NAGPUR: “The practice of   must end,” said Maulana Sayyad Ashraf Gilani, president of   and   (AIUMB), Maharashtra. He was speaking at a special lecture ‘Islam and Terrorism’ at  , on Saturday.

 “I would like study whether triple talaq is mentioned in the Koran and how it should be followed,” he added. Gilani also suggested that the government must ask Islamic scholars to deliberate on the issue and find a solution. 
 
 “Some politicians criticize the divorce practice and use unkind words while describing it. I would request them not to do so. They should work for justice in such cases,” said Gilani. He said that such criticism creates leads to problems among public. 
 
  He compared the practice of triple talaq to murder. He said, “In the eyes of law, divorcing is haram (forbidden) just like murder.” 
 
 “The matter is being handled by the supreme court and we will abide with whatever it decides. An Indian Muslim has full faith in his country, its constitution and its judiciary,” he said.
 
 Speaking on terrorism, Gilani said that acts of terror in India are aided by extremists from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. “There are certain organizations which are being funded by people in the Middle-Eastern countries. The government should monitor this,” he said. According to Gilani, these two countries have stakes in majority of terrorist attacks all over the world.
 
 Gilani cited Russian president Vladimir Putin’s quote on the disturbance in the Middle-East where he alleged American agencies — CIA and FBI — of encouraging terrorism. Gilani said, “Terrorists don’t have factories to manufacture weapons. The weapons are sourced by the US.”
 
 “Islam is a religion of peace. If that wasn’t the case, Muslims around the world would not have been victims of terror attacks,” said Gilani.
