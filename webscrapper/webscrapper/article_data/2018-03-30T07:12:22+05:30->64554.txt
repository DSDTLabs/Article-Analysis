JAIPUR: In the absence of strict vigilance of the district administration and the   ( ), illegal chemical factories and godowns storing inflammable products are sprouting in residential colonies and industrial areas, increasing the likelihood of accidents.

 The major fire that broke out at a chemical factory in the wee hours of Wednesday has exposed the fire safety at these units. Many illegal factories and godowns are operating in residential and industrial areas.
 
 However, the JMC and the district administration have not taken any action against these factories in industrial areas or other illegal establishments.
 
 A senior fire official with JMC said, “The factory owners had not procured any   from the JMC. They were operating the chemical factory illegally.”
 
 Sources at JMC said the list of illegal factories has been given to the district administration several times, but no action was taken.
 
 Though the urban development and housing department has directed the administration to shift the LPG godowns from densely populated areas to the outskirts of the city, authorities are not aware of the notification.
 
 There are nearly 44 LPG godowns situated in residential colonies. An official source with the   ( ) said, “The owners want the government to first provide an alternative and then issue the notification to shift. Also, they want land to be allotted at a concessional rate.”
 
 A JDA official said that no deadline has been issued to shift these godowns as the authority has to first allocate land to relocate them.
