Vijayawada: In what could be a morale boost to the ruling   in the state, BJP leader Raghuramkrishna Raju quit the saffron outfit and joined the party in the presence of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday. 

 Raju, who is also a prominent industrialist, is a relative of Congress MP K V P Ramachandra Rao and was a close associate of late chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh, Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. He first joined YSRC before the bifurcation of the state and soon switched gears to BJP. He was also moving closely with TDP at the time, hoping to contest the Narsapur MP seat in West Godavari district but the TDP had to give the seat to BJP with Gokaraju Ranagaraju winning the seat.
 
 Interacting with the media, Raju said the state needs chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu now. “I am confident that TDP will win more seats than last time. It’s my gut feeling which is also based on some electoral calculations. I am willing to work under IT minister Nara Lokesh as I am junior to him in politics. I have interest in contesting from Narsaraopet. I strongly believe that under the able leadership of Chandrababu Naidu our state will progress. I want to join him and strengthen his hands,” he said.
 
 Along with Raju, some other BJP leaders also joined the TDP. Last month, during the TDP’s public meeting at Tirupati, BJP leader Jayaram had joined the party.
