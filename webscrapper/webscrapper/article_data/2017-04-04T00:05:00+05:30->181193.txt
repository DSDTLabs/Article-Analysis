Indore: School kids of Government Middle School Number 27 in Malwa Mill area never thought they would someday get a chance to play with their favorite cricketers but they were in for a surprise from Virendra Sehwag, head of cricket operations,   and other players like David Miller, Eoin Morgan, Mohit Sharma Varun Aaron, Akshar Patel and Gurkeerat Maan after the cricketers visited the school on Monday morning.

 They were here to promote better sanitation and interact with the students as an initiative by franchise Kings XI Punjab. As a part of the initiative, they will refurbish one girls’ school in both of KXIP’s homegrounds - Indore and Mohali.
 
 However, excited to meet their favorite players, the students performed a small skit for the players on their arrival at the school. This was followed by the players playing a one over friendly match with students.
 
 Commenting on the initiative, Sehwag said, “It is always a pleasure to interact with kids, especially girls and we are glad we got the opportunity to connect with them today. Kings XI Punjab has always worked for the betterment of society and we are positive that this programme will assist them in availing better sanitation facilities at their schools.”
 
 Under the initiative, the franchise along with an NGO has provided the school with better sanitation, drinking facilities and infrastructure.
 
 Satish Menon, chief executive officer, Kings XI Punjab said, “Kings XI Punjab has always cared about the community we live in and try to give back in every way we can. We are glad that our small contribution could encourage them to lead better lives and strive for a healthier and balanced lifestyle”.
