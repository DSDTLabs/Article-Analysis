MUMBAI: When   took their wedding vows and promised to always be there for each other, little did they know they would take their   together. Siddharth dropped out of school after class VII when his family moved to Sion from Goregaon in 1993, while Vijeta quit studies after class V due to financial constraints. “I always wanted to complete my education as my siblings are graduates,” said Siddharth, a security supervisor in a hotel. 
 
 Two years ago, the couple joined class VIII at Gurunath  . “When our children went to school, we thought we should be able to teach them too,” said Vijeta, a homemaker. Siddharth wants to join the fire brigade, while Vijeta wants to do a tailoring or a beautician’s course. They were provided study material by Masoom, a non-profit working with night schools.
