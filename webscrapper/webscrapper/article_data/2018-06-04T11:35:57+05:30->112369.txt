VADODARA: City-based advocate and   spokesperson   on Sunday demanded action against the two professors who are accused of plagiarism. 

 
 Amin has approached Gujarat chief minister and education minister questioning MSU’s inaction in the plagiarism complaint which he had registered last year.
 
 Based on Amin’s complaint, a probe committee appointed by   had also clearly stated in its report that professor P S Choondawat, the former dean of Faculty of Arts, had cleared a PhD thesis which was plagiarised.
 
 Amin had alleged that Choondawat as head of Department of Sociology had cleared PhD thesis of professor Chandramani More from K M Shah Dental College and Hospital of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth who had plagiarised entire thesis of his student Dr  . The committee formed by MSU had stated in its report that all the charges or allegations made by Amin in his complaint are “proved true completely”. 
 
 Although the committee’s report has been placed before MSU’s syndicate members twice, the university authorities have refrained from taking any decision or action. “More than a year and a half have passed after I submitted the complaint with all the relevant evidence. Also, university’s own committee has submitted the report holding the accused guilty long back. But the university officials are providing shelter to such corrupt people,” he said.
