 Apart from putting up flags and dressing up for the day, balloons are also in great demand by the educational institutes and government departments for decoration purposes. “The order starts pouring in from the second week of January. We fail to meet the demands,” said Ranjeet Kumar Jha, owner of a ballon shop on Boring Road. 
 
 Ranjeet this time has an order for 4,000 ballots from government and private institutions.
