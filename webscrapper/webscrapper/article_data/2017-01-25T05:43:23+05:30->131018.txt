HYDERABAD: The blame game has begun after the death of two labourers in the retaining wall collapse at the under-construction building of T-Hub Phase II in Gachibowli. The   ( ) and the   ( ) are both trying to wash their hands of the crisis.

 GHMC officials claim they have no information about the building, its permissions or lack thereof and the agency which took up the construction since the area comes under the jurisdiction of the IALA.
 
 “The area where the wall collapsed is under the IALA. We do not have any information about the constructions and the permissions accorded to it. We do not have any jurisdiction in this area,“ GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy said.
 
 Officials from the IALA, meanwhile, said it was not structural fault that led to the collapse of the building. “A bundle of iron rods fell on the workers.That is what led to their demise,“Cyberabad zonal manager C Vinod Kumar said.
 
 When asked about the compliance checks, which are meant to be taken up by the Authority to ensure the quality of an upcoming structure, he said they have not taken up any of those yet.
 
 A senior town planning official hinted at several constructions in the jurisdiction of IALAs that have deviated from their original plan. “That is one reason why we wanted to merge the IALAs with the GHMC. But they have consistently refused from doing so," he said.
 
 Incidentally, a proposal to merge the IALA with the GHMC was floated in 2011. But the proposal was put on standby owing to the vehement opposition from the former. This proposal once again raised its head in 2015, but the authority continued to oppose the merger.
