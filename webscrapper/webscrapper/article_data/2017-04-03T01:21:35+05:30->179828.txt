 Lucknow: Lucknow could well be among the first few cities of the country to have GPS-enabled garbage collection. For effective implementation of door-to- door collection of garbage, Ecogreen, the agency handling solid waste management, plans to make all collection vehicles GPS-enabled. This would ensure that the location of vehicles, including trolleys, e-rickshaws and mini trucks, would be tracked with just a click. This would also help keep an eye on sanitary workers and monitor their activity.
 
 A detailed route-map of the city has been prepared in which all the by-lanes and roads of congested areas have been identified for door-to-door collection. In the first phase, the agency has submitted the proposal to Lucknow Municipal Corporation for approval. 
 
 At present, in a few metropolitan cities, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technique is used to serve this purpose. It uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track objects attached to it. Rakesh Agarwal, the managing director of Ecogreen, said, “The system will reduce chances of anomalies. Sitting in office, we will be able to check if garbage has been lifted from all areas or not. The proposal has already been sent, we are waiting for its approval.”
 
 Power plant at Shivri: A power generating plant of 15 megawatt capacity will be also be set up at Shivri Solid Waste Management Plant wherein electricity will be made out of trash. Out of 1300 tonne of garbage generated in the city each day some 200-300 tonne will be utilized to produce electricity.
