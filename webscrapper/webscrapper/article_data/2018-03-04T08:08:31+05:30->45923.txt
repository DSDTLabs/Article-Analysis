CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered notice to the inspector general of registration on a plea seeking a direction to permit manual registration of documents till glitches in the recently introduced online registration are removed. 

 Justice   passed the interim order on a plea moved by   of Chennai and posted the plea to March 12 for further hearing.
 
 According to the petitioner, online registration of documents has caused an increase in corruption instead of keeping a check on it. This is mainly because the sub-registrar concerned has the full discretion to accept or reject a document applied for registration, he said.
 
 "There are so many other discrepancies. The online system does not provide facility to include the schedule and boundaries for the properties. 
 
 "And there's no provision for registration of   which complicates registration of properties that do not have patta," the petitioner said.
 
 This apart, simple facilities like provision to provide PAN numbers of parties are missing. Certain categories of documents like the title of the vendor and previous vendors have to be clearly stated, but the system has no provision to accept these details and in the process the documents cannot be properly prepared, he added.
 
 Claiming that the number of touts and brokers has increased in the guise of providing online registration service, the petitioner said that such persons were   as service charges for helping people to register through the online system.
