HYDERABAD: Wannbe   owners need not fret about the health of their animals. While launching the scheme on June 10, the   government will also start a mobile   that will rush to the help of one' s sick sheep once a call is made to the new toll free number.

 “Along with providing the sheep farmers with the animals, the government has decided to introduce mobile veterinary clinics in all rural assembly constituencies,“ sources in the government said.
 
 The mobile clinics are necessitated as the state government has decided to distribute 84 lakh sheep to four lakh Yadav, Kuruma and Golla families in the next two years. Though there are veterinary hospitals at mandal level and the sheep would administer de-worming at the time of procurement, it is not possible to attend to them if they fall sick due to various reasons. But in order to make these mobile clinics functional, the TRS government has to ensure that the 309 vacancies of assistant veterinary surgeons posts across the state are filled up at the earliest.
 
 “All the sheep farmer has to do is call the 247 toll free number 1962. Mobile veterinary clinics would reach immediately. The prototype of the mobile clinic will arrive in a week,“ animal husbandry director D Venkateshwarlu told TOI on Friday.
