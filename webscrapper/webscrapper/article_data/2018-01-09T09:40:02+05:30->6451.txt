CHANDIGARH: Has the drama within the local wing of the BJP to grab power in the mayoral elections changed the scenario for the saffron party for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the city? Sources in the BJP said the entire episode — the filing of papers by outgoing mayor Asha   as an independent for the mayor’s post and her subsequent withdrawal — has forced the party’s central leadership to re-examine the entire organisational structure in the party.

 “Although Chandigarh has only one seat in Parliament, this kind of act has given a serious headache to the senior party leaders. The step by Jaswal, considered a loyalist of Chandigarh party president Sanjay Tandon, has spoilt the image of the party. Moreover, BJP is a kind of party which cannot tolerate any kind of rebellion,” sources said.
 
 “The party’s organisational structure, different factions and the level of infighting will be discussed in the coming days. BJP president Amit Shah had already announced preparations have begun for the 2019 elections many months back and had visited the city’s party office too.”
 
 The development has given a political edge to MP Kirron Kher, who batted for Davesh Moudgil, but his unacceptance at such a large scale — around 10 councillors supported Jaswal — has also raised questions over why Kher and   had developed such bitter relations with Tandon loyalists.
 
 All these issue will be later discussed at length after the mayoral poll. Both the groups are likely to camp in New Delhi to clear their position.
