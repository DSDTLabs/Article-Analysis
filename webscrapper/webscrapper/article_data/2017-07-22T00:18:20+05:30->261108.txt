NAVI MUMBAI: In a setback to   (GB), the Urban Development Department (UDD) has rescinded GB's March month's resolution of not approving civic administration proposal to   the   GV Rao accused of misconduct and initiating unnecessary development work without following proper tendering process. 

 A departmental inquiry was initiated by earlier civic chief Tukaram Mundhe against the officer based on a complaint raised by the Deputy Mayor Avinash Lad on August 17, 2015. 
 
 As per the government decision issued on July 20, the GB's resolution to reject the dismissal is stated to be contrary to the provisions of section 451 (1) of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act therefore it was being suspended. “The decision effectively means that the administration’s move to dismiss the official is appropriate and now final decision will be taken after the completion of 30-day notice period when the concerned can respond,” said Municipal Commissioner Dr N Ramaswami. When contacted Rao refrained from making any comments on the matter. 
 
 Meanwhile, the civic administration will be probing a complaint raised against another official. Medical officer   has been accused of pursuing higher studies without availing leave from the office and also drew salary for the same time period. When contacted, Mane stated that he had not flouted any norms." I am being framed and have already given my say on the matter."
