Pimpri Chinchwad: The municipal corporation has decided to allot   to the Agricultural Produce   Committee (APMC) in the twin township to farmers for selling their produce directly to the consumers in weekly markets.

 The decision was taken on Friday in a meeting attended by mayor Nitin Kalje, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and APMC office-bearers.
 
 The civic administration has decided not to allot stalls at the Pimpri vegetable market to local vegetable vendors, and give them only to farmers. Kalje directed the engineering department to allot alternative land to farmers selling flowers at the busy Shagun Chowk. The mayor has also asked the health department to remove the filth and vegetable waste at the Pimpri market immediately. He also directed the department to remove garbage from all other places.
