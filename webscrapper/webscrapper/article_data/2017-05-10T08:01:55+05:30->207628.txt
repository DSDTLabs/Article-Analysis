BHOPAL: Old and worn out pipeline and mismanagement by   Municipal Corporation is responsible for the drinking   in the city. Sample this, despite an above average monsoon last year, around 2.5 lakh people are facing water shortage. Ever since the onset of summer, pipelines have developed leaks frequently affecting supply in many parts. 

 At the peak of summer,   has reduced water supply by around 10 mgd per day —which can meet the daily needs of more than two lakh people. But, civic body officials refused to admit that there is a water crisis. However, facts speak for themselves as 20 wards of the city are receiving water supply on alternate days. This includes colonies that are connected to Idgah filtration plant. Around six wards faced water shortage for some 72 hours after a pipeline connecting pumping station at Karbala with Idgah filtration plant was damaged on Saturday. BMC water in-charge AK Pawar maintained that there is no shortage in water supply. 
 
 “If BMC is not supplying at its full capacity, how are citizens still getting water?” he asked. Experts said that the problem of water crunch is manifold and BMC is well aware of its failures. They said that much of the   pipeline that the civic body laid is not being utilised. 
 
 Moreover, filtration capacity of BMC plants was built to accommodate less than half of city’s current population. Further, BMC’s proposal for installation of modern filtration facility is yet to be fully implemented. Civic body officials indicate that these would come up only after monsoon. Another issue is completing pending projects that include new lines and new water connections to outskirts of the city, including educational hubs in Bhauri.
