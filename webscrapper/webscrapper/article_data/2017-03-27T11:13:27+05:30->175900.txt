ALLAHABAD:  's (cow-sheds) have appealed to the new state government to provide ' ' (land for cow-grazing). Gaushala authorities claimed, "State government must take initiatives to ensure  , their fodder and proper upkeep." 

 Convener of Jhunsi-based gaushala, Vivek Pandey said, "The concept of gochar bhoomi is not new but successive governments have done nothing for protection and proper upkeep of cows. Previous state government released funds for boundary wall construction of graveyards but did not allocate funds for gochar bhoomi." Pandey maintained that a delegation comprising organisers of 200-odd gaushalas from Prayag region would meet chief minister   and deputy CM   with a charter of demands including strict implementation of Gau commission and alleged, "We are compiling records on current status of 'gochar bhoomi' whether they have been encroached or their land has been transferred to graveyards". "Strong and effective measures must be taken to protect cows across the state," said another Phaphamau-based gaushala organiser, adding, "There is also need to set up a special platform for cow products so that dairy products from big and small gaushalas find better platform for marketing." 
 
 Pandey, meanwhile, said "Most of the gaushalas have no proper boundary walls and state government must ask officials of forest department to take measures for gaushala safety and security. Cows suffer much during flood season and adequate grant must be given for the cow sheds." 
 
 Majority of gaushalas have switched to social media to invite families/individuals to take part in events and make efforts to protect cows. The gaushalas are also conducting religious programmes to invoke public support to the cause of cow protection.
