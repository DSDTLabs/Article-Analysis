Headbangers loved every bit of the performance in the city by guitarist  , who is from a small city in   called Digboi. He performed a mix of numbers which included original compositions and covers by famous guitarists, including, Kiko Loureiro, Paul Gilbert, John Petrucci,  , etc. He also has a special connect with the city for he is an alumnus and a former guitar faculty at AR  ���s school in Chennai. Apart from music, the guitarist says that he enjoys the heritage associated with the city, its temples, beaches and every place that speaks volumes about the culture and traditions of Tamil Nadu. Excerpts from a chat with him.

 Working with AR Rahman
 It has always been a dream to learn under Rahman sir and get a chance to work with him. He is an ocean of knowledge. For me, every moment with him is more of a learning and an innovative journey. I started exploring music in depth after I joined his institute. For a musician, knowledge in music theory is very important and I managed to learn a fair amount of it, in Chennai. Apart from music, another thing which I learnt from Rahman sir is patience. That���s another must-have attribute for a good musician. 
 
 Independent music... 
 We���ve amazing musicians from every part of our country. And in the last few years, the independent music scene has shaped up well. In Chennai, independent musicians are doing well and are quite ahead compared to musicians from other cities in India. If you���re looking for real talents, you will find them in the independent music industry. 
 
 Music collaborations... 
 It is very important to collaborate with other musicians in order to explore music. Things open up more when you collaborate. You get better ideas on how to present the uniqueness in your music. Experimentation is a way to innovative music. Talking about collaborations, one musician I would like to work with from Chennai is Ilayaraja sir. 
 
 My kind of music
 Music has always been my first priority. Initially, I started listening to classical music before exploring different genres of rock, metal and fusion music. I like exploring more on new techniques, new age music, etc. I am open to any kind of quality music. I am not very genre specific. But I personally love blues. You will find more of guitar progressions in my compositions, and a blend of neo-classical to heavy metal and blues to complex new-age progressive music.
