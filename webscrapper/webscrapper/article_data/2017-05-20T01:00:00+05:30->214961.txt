The untimely demise of Bollywood and television’s endearing mother,  , has shaken the unit of her last daily soap ' '. The actress passed away on Thursday and the makers are yet to come to terms with the void she has left both in their lives and the show. Even as they mourned her loss, they had to work overtime to find a suitable replacement to play  . We now hear that seasoned actress   has been assigned the mammoth task to fill in for her.

 “Though I hadn’t worked with Reemaji, we knew each other because of our theatre background. I am a Gujarati theatre artiste and she had featured in a few Gujarati plays,” Ragini says, adding, “I have never replaced any actress in my career so far, let alone replacing someone who is no more with us. I was finalised for the show within two hours. The task is challenging and I am overwhelmed with emotions. Playing the part, which was originally portrayed to perfection by Reemaji, feels extremely heavy. But as they say, the show must go on.”
 
 Ragini says that her latest project will be a dedication to the late actress. “It’s not possible to replicate her on the show. I have been given the creative freedom to approach the character my way. This one will be for Reemaji,” she states.
 
 Ragini has worked in several shows, including 'Ek Mahal Ho Sapno Ka', 'Mera Sasuraal', 'Diya Aur Baati Hum' and 'Saraswatichandra'.
