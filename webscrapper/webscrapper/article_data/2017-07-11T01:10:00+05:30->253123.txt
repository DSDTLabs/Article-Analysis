Dharmapuri: Tourists have started to throng the Hogenakkal waterfalls in Dharmapuri district following the release of 4,000 cusecs of water from Kabini and Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dams in Karnataka. Hundreds of tourists took bath and went for a coracle ride in the Cauvery river on Sunday and Monday. 

 Hogenakkal, a famous spot for fresh fish and coracle riding, did not attract tourists for the last four months after Cauvery went dry due to drought. Similarly, all the three waterfalls in Hogenakkal including the Cini-falls had gone dry. 
 
 The Karnataka government released 4,000 cusecs of water from KRS and Kabini dams from July 2 onwards to comply with a Supreme Court order. As per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal order, Karnataka has to release 134 tmc ft of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu from June to September. Showing drought and poor water storage in its dams, the Karnataka government refused to release water in June. Finally, the Karnataka government released the water after the Tamil Nadu government moved the Supreme Court. 
 
 The Cauvery water reached Biligundulu and Hogenakkal on July 7. Initially, the inflow to Biligundulu was 1,100 cusecs and it increased steadily. The inflow has risen to 2,200 cusecs on Monday morning. 
 
 After seeing water in the river, hundreds of tourists thronged Hogenakkal since Sunday. They enjoyed taking bath in Cini-falls. Similarly, a few tourists enjoyed coracle riding in the river and they were taken up to Iverbani river.
