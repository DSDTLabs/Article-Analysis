AHMEDABAD: The state education department has been compelled to change the vacation dates for primary schools after the Gujarat Secondary and   (GSHSEB) changed them for secondary and higher secondary schools.

 Like at secondary and higher secondary schools, the summer vacation for primary schools will now begin on May 7 instead of May 1. Similarly, schools will reopen after the vacation on June 10 instead of June 4. The change became necessary as vacation dates for all schools are kept uniform.
 
 This decision drew flak from some parents as many had fixed vacation plans. Apart from parents, teachers and school staff who had made vacation plans are also upset. Many of them will be forced to cancel and re-book tickets and accommodation for holidays away from home or visits to their native places.
