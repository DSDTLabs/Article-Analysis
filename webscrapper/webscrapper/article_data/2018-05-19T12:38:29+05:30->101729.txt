CHENNAI: The city police on Friday seized four tonnes of gutka from three godowns — two in Porur and one in   — and arrested two men for storing the banned tobacco derivative.

 
 The police, who were carrying out raids in the city till late on Friday night, said the seized gutka was worth several lakhs of rupees.
 
 During a vehicle check near   in  , the police intercepted a minitruck and questioned the driver. When the driver, Muthu, 22, of  , made contradictory statements, they checked the vehicle and found eight gunny bags of gutka weighing 5kg.
 
 Interrogated by the police, Muthu revealed that he was taking the gutka to a warehouse in Mangadu where he was to deliver the consignment to a person named Kumar.
 
 The Puzhal police alerted their counterparts in Mangadu, who raided the godown. They found and seized packets of gutka from the spot.
 
 The police produced Muthu before a magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. They also picked up Kumar and are questioning him.
 
 An investigating officer said locals believed the warehouse in Mangadu was for the storage of water cans. They had no idea that it was used to stock gutka, he said, because minitrucks arrived at the unit carrying water cans and hardware items, which men who used the warehouse loaded and unloaded at the site.
 
 Acting on tip they received, police teams also raided two godowns in Porur.
 
 The city police in February detected a transhipment point in   from where smugglers dispatched gutka and other banned tobacco derivatives, sourced from other states, to various outlets in Chennai. The police seized over 2,400kg of gutka products that smugglers had transported in five containers by train from Delhi.
