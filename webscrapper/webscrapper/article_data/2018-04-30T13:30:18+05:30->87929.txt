LUCKNOW: Young doctors say that if the retirement age of doctors increases, much lesser number of seats would be vacant every year for freshers.

 
 “There is a loss of young talent in the teaching profession. The government is setting up eight new medical colleges. Guidance of elders can be used in these colleges,” said Prof  , general secretary of KGMU Teachers’ Association.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 According to young professionals, the issue of shortage of doctors in rural areas cannot directly be linked to retirement age, as the government believes.
 
 “It is the younger and more enthusiastic faculty members who would most likely fulfil the state government’s agenda of delivering service in rural areas. Doctors after 65 years of age would be least likely to move to rural areas,” said Dr  , executive committee member of SGPGIMS faculty forum.
 
 “It was said that specialist doctors do not want to join the profession. But the recent response to advertisement for faculty positions shows there is no shortage of applicants. For the entry-level post of assistant professor, there were 22 applications for six posts in anaesthesiology, 19 for five posts in emergency medicine, 14 applications for two posts in haematology and so on,” said Prof MS  , secretary of SGPGIMS faculty forum.
 
 The group contested that even if the doctors are to be retained, it should be done so on contractual basis and in exceptional cases.
