Panaji: FC Goa are expected to make another change to their foreign player contingent before the international transfer window closes in the next 24 hours.
 
  Spanish winger   is understood to be on his way out and will be replaced by French-Moroccan midfielder  , who will be the second new recruit at the club following the arrival of former Kerala Blasters striker Mark Sifneos.
  
  Adrian  , whose differences with coach and compatriot   have been well documented, has already quit the club and left for home.
  
  Arana will now follow in his footsteps, although there is a possibility that he might agree to a loan move to Delhi Dynamos.
  
  “We are still talking to the player and his agent. We hope to resolve this quickly,” said one official.
  
  Arana was involved in 10 FC Goa matches and was named Man-of-the-Match for his showing against Delhi Dynamos. Arana scored three goals and had two assists during his 313 minutes on the field for FC Goa.
  
  The arrival of Hugo from France is in line with Lobera’s thinking that he needs foreign reinforcement in the centre of the field, rather than on the wings. Hugo is someone who trained under Lobera during his time in Morocco and his abilities in midfield – both defensive and attacking – have found favour with the Spanish coach.
  
  Hugo, 23, was plying his trade in the Moroccan league for Moghreb Tetouan and played under Lobera last season there.
  
  FC Goa are currently placed fourth on the ISL table with 19 points from 11 matches and have a tricky run of matches before they can seal their place among the top four. FC Goa next play NorthEast United FC at home on Sunday.
