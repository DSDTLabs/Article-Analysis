NEW DELHI: You may have to cough up a bit more for those fancy joggers or sharp stilettos, as custom duty on imported footwear has doubled to 20% and levy on footwear components has risen to 15% from 10%.

 Around three-fourth of high-end sports shoes sold by companies, including  ,   and Puma are imported. For instance, Asics Gel 360 shoes when imported into India, which currently cost Rs 15,999 may now cost Rs 17,120, according to EY.
 
 Top sportswear brands are betting on the   (AIFTA) treaty, which allows goods from 10 countries, including   and   to be imported into India with minimal customs duty. “After China, Vietnam is the hub for top-end sports shoe manufacturing,” said an Indian shoe manufacturer and retailer. Brands such as  , which makes around 80% of its products in India, has adopted the wait and watch policy.
