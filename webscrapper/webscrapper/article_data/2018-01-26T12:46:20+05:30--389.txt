NAGPUR: Chancellor C   Rao has appointed eight eminent experts, including two from VNIT, as his nominees on Nagpur University’s Academic Council.

 The two VNIT experts include its director Narendra Chaudhary and Dilip Peshwe, head of department of Metallurgical and Materials engineering. Rest are industry experts, including Vidarbha Industries Association president  , and academicians from city and others parts of the state.
 
 The academic council, which regulates teaching, research and evaluation in the university, will also comprise 14 nominated members by the vice-chancellor besides top NU officers, deans and directors. VC has to nominate eight principals, two professors, one head of a recognized institution, two teachers, one representative of management nominated by the Senate from amongst the representatives of managements.
 
 Though the NU has issued a notification regarding the chancellor’s nominee, it is yet to notify the vice-chancellor’s nominees for which names were finalized in July. Later, the chancellor’s office had asked NU to conduct background checks of those nominated by the VC.
 
 Last month, one of the VC’s nominees - Bhandara’s Jasubhai Patel principal Vikas Dhomne - had declared himself ineligible for academic council membership as the NAAC accreditation of his college had expired.
 
 Besides Chaudhary, Peshwe and Pande, the nominated members include director of   Survey&Land Use Planning, Nagpur, Surendra Kumar Singh; director of Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Rural Industrialization, Wardha, Prafullakumar Kale; director of Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre, Nagpur, Subrata Das; vice-chancellor of Balasaheb Savant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth, Tapas Bhattacharyya; and managing director of   Mumbai, Achyut Godbole.
