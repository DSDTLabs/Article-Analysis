NEW DELHI: Amid a sealing drive being carried out on the directions of an  , the South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday announced an   scheme for  . Under the scheme, no interest and penalty will be charged if a trader makes a one-time payment as conversion charge for 2007-2017 before March 2018.

 SDMC mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, “It was unanimously decided by the deliberative wing to give some relaxation to traders who are yet to deposit conversion charges between 2007 and 2017. They are already facing problems due to the sealing drive,” Sehrawat said.
 
 The sealing drive, however, has nothing to do with conversion charges and is targeting those who haven’t paid “use conversion charge”. A senior official said: “Conversion charge is to be paid annually, or on a one-time basis for 10 years, whereas use conversion charge is paid just once. The use conversion charge is levied on properties where commercial activity is not allowed and one has to pay this charge to convert the land use for the same. The ongoing sealing activity is for use conversion charge and misuse of land for running commercial activities.”
 
 The south civic body had recently launched an amnesty scheme for those who had not paid their taxes after 2004. 
 
 SDMC also adopted a resolution to conduct a survey in Najafgarh and officials were directed to find out the number of commercial establishments running there. “The land use of Najafgarh zone comes under agricultural land and the department has been directed to conduct a survey. If there are more than 50% commercial establishments, then a proposal will be sent to the Delhi government to notify the particular stretch as commercial to avoid any sealing activity initiated by the monitoring committee,” said the official. 
 
 Meanwhile, the north corporation sealed 23 shops in Rohini for operating without trade licence.
