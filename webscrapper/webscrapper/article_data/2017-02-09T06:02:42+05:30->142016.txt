NEW DELHI: AAP MP  , who was at the receiving end of the Prime Minister’s speech in   on Tuesday, approached the Speaker on Wednesday, seeking that the “derogatory” remarks made against him be expunged.

 In a letter to Speaker  , Mann requested her to direct Prime Minister   to clarify the remarks. He said he should also be allowed to pose some questions to the Prime Minister.
 
 He said if that was not possible, the Speaker could get the “derogatory” remakes expunged. Mann also suggested that if the remarks could not be expunged then he be allowed to approach the privileges committee of Lok Sabha.
 
 Taking on the critics, Modi had said in the Lok Sabha, “I generally tell people ‘ghee piyo’...but if Bhagwant Mann were to tell people, he will ask them to drink something else.”
 
 Mann has been a strident critic of Modi, openly mocking him in public rallies. 
 
 The Lok Sabha member from Sangrur also took a dig at the Prime Minister’s “speech for an hour and 45 minutes” saying it had “dohas” in Sanskrit and “jumlas”. In a video clip on Facebook, he said, “But he (Modi) failed to provide answers to the issues raised by me in Parliament.”
 
 “The speech resembled the pravachans (religious discourse) delivered by  ,” he said.
 
 “He also recited a “doha” on me. It would have been good if Modi had given answers to the issues raised by me. He should have replied to my contention that more than 125 persons died after demonetisation. He should have given a reply to a young woman from Punjab whose father died two days before her marriage due to demonetisation.”
 
 He said Modi also ignored the issue of waiving off loans of farmers in Punjab. agencies
