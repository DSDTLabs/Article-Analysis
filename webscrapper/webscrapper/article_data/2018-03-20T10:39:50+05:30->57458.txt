VADODARA: It is unconstitutional and wrong that MPs decide their own salaries, said  , BJP MP from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Gandhi was in the city to participate in an interactive programme titled ‘Ideas for a New India’ organized by city-based   on Monday.

 “In India, MPs have increased their own salaries by 4% in last five years. I do not mind if they are being paid well, but none of you, who will get jobs after completing education, will be able to command your price. Your bosses will decide how much you will get,” said Gandhi, adding, “I do not understand this concept where MPs raise their hands and increase their salaries.” Gandhi also said that he had written to the speaker of Lok Sabha to create a constitutional body to decide the salaries after looking into the performances and cost of living.
 
 Gandhi also called for a televised debate with participation of all candidates before any polls in the country. “We should have a one-hour debate where all of them put their visions in front of voters. If one candidate will have fantastic vision, he will surely win,” he said. “Right now we don’t kn-ow what the candidates think. Therefore, we vote for the person who comes from our community. Debates will stop this,” he added at a packed Sir Sayajirao Nagar Gruh.
