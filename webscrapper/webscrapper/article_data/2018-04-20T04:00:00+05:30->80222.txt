Chennai: Off highway tyre maker ATG, which already has a plant each in Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu and Dahej in Gujarat is scouting for a third plant in India but will probably not zero in on Tamil Nadu. 

 The company plans to invest $300 million over the next five years on fresh capacity in India and globally said CEO Nitin Mantri.
 
 “We are definitely planning to add both capacity and capital and we are looking at a number of states in India for our third plant,” said Mantri.
 
  “We are looking at locations in both north India as well as south India and may be we will go for Andhra Pradesh or Gujarat. It may not be Tamil Nadu because we already have a plant here,” he added.
 
 The company employs around 2,500 people in its two factories so far and the new plant will help ramp up its installed capacity substantially. “Right now we produce around 1,30,000-1,40,000 tonne per year but by 2025 we should be able to double that between our greenfield and brownfield facilities in India,'' he said. The new plant location will be finalised in 3-6 months,” he added. The company is also looking at inorganic growth along with capacity addition to grow its business. “We are looking at inorganic opportunities both in India and abroad,” said Mantri. “We are focussing on products we don't make or regions we don't serve as the right opportunities.”
 
 The off-highway tyre business has been growing steadily in India with 3-5% growth depending on segments.
