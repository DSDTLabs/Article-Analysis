 ABS is the brainchild of its South African-born Founder & President, Debi Steven. Having survived a rape at 11 years of age, Debi has built her twenty-five year career on trying to prevent this happening to others.
 
 “Having already taught our Empowerment and Personal Safety workshop to 34,000 women and girls in India (20,000 in Kerala), it became increasingly clear to us that, by only educating women and girls, we were not preventing abusive and violent behaviours at their root,” says Debi Steven. “Our gender sensitisation for young boys teaches boys to empathise - to develop the ability to understand and share the feelings of others – so that they are less likely to engage in abusive and violent behaviour towards them.”
 
 “We had long been considering what the Centre for Gandhian Studies could do to address the major issue of gender-based violence in India, so we are delighted to partner with the charity to bring these ground-breaking gender sensitisation workshops to Kerala,” said Teresa Joseph, Director of the Centre for Gandhian Studies, Alphonsa College.
