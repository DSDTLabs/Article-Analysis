 It is also being alleged that a senior Noida policeman had taken money to spare the lives of Anil Bhati and Sahdev Bhati after they surrendered. The police have denied the claim and stressed that the two were intercepted during a routine check by Kotwali police in Shamli district.
 
 The move comes a day after the police had announced a Rs 50,000 reward each for the arrest of Anil, Sahdev and Sheru Bhati, all said to members of the Sunder Bhati gang, and attached their properties.
 
 The surrender claim assumes significance against the backdrop of a series of encounters by the UP police over the past few months. The Opposition parties in the state and human rights groups have levelled allegations that many of the encounters were fake and several criminals were let off against bribe. 
 
 BJP worker Yadav and his two personal guards, Balli Nath and Raispal, were shot dead by a group of nine persons who attacked their Toyota Fortuner in Noida Extension on November 16, 2017.
 
 The three victims were rushed to Fortis Hospital, where Yadav and Nath were declared brought dead. Raispal succumbed to injuries later that night in GTB Hospital.
 
 A 14-year-old girl crossing the road was also hit when the gang was chasing Yadav’s SUV. She, too, succumbed to injuries in a Noida hospital.
 
 The Noida STF and local police had initially arrested three persons — Arun Yadav, his aide Dharmdutt Sharma and Naresh Jaat, a shooter in the Sunder Bhati gang — on December 4.
 
 Arun had reportedly told the police he had planned Yadav’s murder to avenge the death of his father Mahendra Yadav, who was a head constable in Uttar Pradesh police. 
 
 Mahendra had died in an accident in 2004, but his family suspected the entire episode had been planned by the BJP worker.
