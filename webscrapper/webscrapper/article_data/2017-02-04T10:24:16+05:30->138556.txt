ALLAHABAD: The State   has stayed a Basic Shiksha Parishad order calling for inter-district transfer of teachers of government primary schools, which was issued a day before Model Code of Conduct came into effect in poll-bound UP. 

 The apex governing body of the state's government primary schools had issued the transfer order, after publishing a list of teachers to be transferred on January 3, despite an order by the Commission stating that teachers employed in poll duties should not be transferred.
