TARINI: After an arduous voyage of eight months to circumnavigate the globe on a sail boat, with stop-overs at five ports, INSV Tarini with six women naval officers is set to be flagged in with fanfare in Goa on Monday. 

  The "Navika Sagar Parikrama" expedition, led by Lieutenant Commander  , is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. Covering over 21,600 nautical miles since she left Goa on September 10 last year, the Indian-built sailing vessel INSV Tarini visited five countries and crossed the Equator twice, sailed across four continents and three oceans, and "passed south" of the three "Great Capes" - Leeuwin, Horn and Good Hope. 
 
  "It was a gruelling test of human endurance, perseverance and sailing skills to battle the elements of sea and its wrath," said Navy spokesperson Captain D K Sharma on Friday. The crew, which also included Lt-Commanders Pratibha Jamwal and Swati P, and Lieutenants Aishwarya Boddapati, S Vijaya Devi and Payal Gupta, have shown exemplary grit and determination. 
 
 The expedition was sailed in six legs, with stop-overs at the Fremantle Australia, New Zealand, Falklands, South Africa and Mauritius.
 
  The women officers trained under Captain Dilip Donde, the first Indian to solo-circumnavigate the globe in 2009-2010, and Captain Atool Sinha, an Asian Games silver medallist, for almost three years to prepare for the voyage. The strenous training regime paid off, with the spirited women set to be to be received by defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba in Goa on Monday.
