JAIPUR: The   ( ) of Rajasthan police on Saturday busted another gang involved in implicating people in fake rape cases and extorting huge amount of money from them.

 Karan Sharma, additional SP, told TOI that SOG has arrested   and Rani Shukla from Mansarovar area of the city for extorting Rs 70 lakh from a Jaipur-based charted accountant.
 
 “In 2013, the duo threatened to file a fake rape case against a Jaipur-based CA.   and Rani Shukla and allegedly introduced a Kota-based girl Anit to the CA and later asked him to give Rs 75 lakh to them,” Sharma said.
 
 The duo blackmailed the CA professional for several years, until one day he paid them Rs 75 Lakh.
 
 “The victim filed a complaint against the duo at SOG and we arrested them from   area of the city,” Sharma said.
 
 The SOG is probing how many other people the duo had trapped and blackmailed for money. “We suspect that they were part of an organised gang which introduced girls to affluent people and then blackmailed them,” SOG officials said.
 
 A few months ago, the SOG had busted a similar racket where people were blackmailed in false rape cases and then lawyers would extort money from them. “Right now, we have only one victim but we suspect that list might grow as more people are likely to come to the SOG,” added another official.
 
 The SOG is currently interrogating the duo to get more details about their gang.
