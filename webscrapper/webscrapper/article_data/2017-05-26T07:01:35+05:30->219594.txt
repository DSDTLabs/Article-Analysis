AHMEDABAD: Union HRD Minister   assured class XII students on Thursday that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) results will be declared on schedule.   was speaking on the sidelines of the   annual meetings. In wake of the Delhi high court order restraining the   from scrapping its moderation policy this year, there had been widespread apprehension that the results might be delayed, thus affecting college admission prospects of CBSE students.

 Javadekar told reporters, “The CBSE will publish results on schedule. Students need not worry as justice will be done to everyone. We are not making any drastic change in the system, and consequently there would be no drastic change in the results.”
 
 The CBSE had last month announced scrapping of its moderation policy on extra marks. Under the policy, grace marks are given to students in exams to compensate for difficult or erroneous questions. The scrapping of the policy was challenged in Delhi high court, which ordered the CBSE not to implement the scrapping of its moderation policy immediately this year. The court had termed the move of scrapping moderation as “irresponsible”.
 
 In response to a query over discrepancies in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in Gujarati, Javadekar said, “I had a discussion with Bhupendrasinh Chudasama,   education minister, and assure students that they would not lose out on marks irrespective of the language in which they have appeared for NEET.”
 
 “A scientific system is there and the marks calculation will be done using this system to ensure that no injustice is done to the students,” Javadekar said.
 
 In reply to a question over bringing a central law similar to Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees), Union HRD minister, Prakash Javadekar, said that fixing of fees for schools was a matter for states. He said that the Centre has already directed CBSE schools to be reasonable in charging or increasing fees.
