VISAKHAPATNAM: On Thursday morning,  , a businessman from the city was driving past the   and stopped at the signal, when he was approached by the  . “I was surprised and was wondering, whether the cops are conducting checks for licences and drunken driving so early in the morning and was preparing to show them all my papers. But I was even more surprised when instead of inspection, I was complimented with a gift for wearing the seat belt and adhering to traffic rules. Indeed, it’s a wonderful initiative taken by TOI encouraging and educating people about the importance of following traffic rules,” said Ganesh.

 Like Ganesh, around 100 motorists at Shoppers Stop Junction and another 100 at Gopalpatnam Junction, following traffic rules and some carrying copies of TOI, turned out to be lucky recipients of gifts as part of TOI’s fortnight-long ‘Win with the Times’ campaign. 
 
 Two-wheeler rider and a private bank employee K Lavanya was driving to her workplace when she was stopped by the traffic cops at Shoppers Stop Junction. “I always wear a helmet, even if it’s for a short distance and so I was doubtful when the traffic police came near me. But soon, the gifts handed over to me for following traffic rules brightened up my day.”
 
 Organised by The Times of India, ‘Win with the Times’ campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag RTA departments and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday between 8.30 am and 10 am. On Friday, the campaign will be held at Gurudwara Junction and Asilmetta Junction.
