CHANDIGARH: Demanding expulsion of senior   leaders Jagdish   and   Kumar, the   on Monday urged it not to indulge in political drama by projecting to distance itself from the two leaders and otherwise supporting them.

 Accusing Tytler and Kumar of being perpetrators of 1984 Sikh massacre, SAD spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said Monday’s directive to both the leaders to leave the Congress dharna site in Delhi where party president Rahul Gandhi was set to undertake a fast was another example of the party’s hypocrisy. “The very fact that the leaders reached the dharna site proves that they are active members of the Congress. It also proves that the Congress party as well as the Gandhi family continues to nurture them secretly,” alleged Cheema.
 
 He added that the Congress decision to ask the two party leaders to leave the venue proved that the Gandhi family was afraid of some facts being revealed which would implicate the senior party leadership as well as them (Gandhi family) in the 1984 Sikh massacre case.
 
 Cheema said that Tytler had given a hint of disclosures in case the Congress party took any action against him, by openly stating in a television interview that he had taken former Prime Minister   to various parts of Delhi in November 1984, which were subsequently wreaked by mayhem against the Sikh community. 
 
 The Akali leader added that Tytler even presented the killing of Sikhs as a ‘service’ rendered to the Gandhi family in a subsequent sting video for which he claimed he was entitled to special and highly respectable consideration. “Neither the Congress nor the Gandhi family contradicted his claim that he was promised chief ministership of Delhi or a   seat indicating the hold he has over the Gandhi family,” added Cheema.
