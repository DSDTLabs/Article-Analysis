BHUBANESWAR: A 25-year-old computer science student allegedly hanged himself to death during a video chat with a girl on WhatsApp. The incident occurred late on Thursday night in Puri, but the police recovered his body after breaking open the door to his room on Friday.

 The deceased was identified as  . Police said he along with his parents and sister stayed in a hotel run by his father on lease near the sea beach. Roy took the extreme step when his family members went to attend a function in Puri.
 
 Police said Roy chatted with the girl for nearly thirty minutes and then switched over to video chat. "The girl told us that Roy was very upset over personal matters. But we are yet to ascertain the cause of his depression and subsequent suicide," SP (Puri)   said.
 
 Police sources said the girl, who studies at a private engineering college in Bhubaneswar, informed the boy's parents about his suicide. 
 
 "He hanged himself to death during the video chat. The girl said she tried to dissuade him not to end his life. She immediately informed his family members who were then away from home," another police officer said. 
 
 The worried family members immediately asked the hotel staff to rescue Roy. "We knocked on the door but it was locked from inside. There was no response. His family members reached and they also raised an alarm. Finally we called the police," a hotel staff said. 
 
 Police said they have seized the boy's mobile phone but refused to divulge the contents of the chat. "It was not possible to retrieve the sequence of the video chat as it does not get saved. But we are scanning the text messages on WhatsApp. The girl is in a state of shock and could not reveal much," the police officer said. In February last year a research scholar at the   (IMMT) here had allegedly hanged herself to death while she was on a video call with her friend.
