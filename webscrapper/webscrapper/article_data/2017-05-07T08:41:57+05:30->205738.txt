PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Construction of two ramps for the two-tier flyover at Nashik Phata is in its final stages.

 The ramps are expected to reduce traffic snarls at the busy junction of   and Pune-Nashik highways. While one of the ramps will lead to Pimpri, Nigdi and Mumbai, the other will direct the commuters towards Pimple Gurav, Pimple Saudagar, Wakad and Hinjewadi. 
 
 The construction of another ramp leading to Pune has been completed, but is yet to be opened for vehicular traffic, owing to the fear of accidents at the busy chowk.
 
 Rajan Patil, joint city engineer,  , said that once the construction gets over, Nashik Phata would become the first signal-free chowk in the city.
 
 “The   (PCMC) is constructing two ramps and one loop for the flyover to make Nashik Phata signal-free. The work will be over by next month and the ramps will be opened for the public in June.”
 
 The PCMC will conduct awareness campaigns and create a short animated film to brief the commuters on how to use the ramps, loop and flyover to reach their destinations. “Barricades will be set up at the chowk and on the flyover to ensure that people use one of the two ramps or loop while using the flyover to cross the chowk,” said Patil.
 
 Traffic police will be deployed to enforce the signal-free chowk plan.
 
 The 61-metre wide Nashik Phata chowk is one of the busiest junctions in Pimpri Chinchwad as Pune-Nashik highway and Nashik Phata-Wakad BRTS meet Pune-Mumbai highway at this point.   railway station is located near the chowk.
