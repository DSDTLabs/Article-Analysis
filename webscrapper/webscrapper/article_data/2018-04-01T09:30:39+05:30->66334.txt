PANCHKULA: Sector 20 residents have been living in   and unhygienic environment as sewage seep into the sectorâ€™s parking lots and internal parks. Blockage in the sewerage pipeline causes the dirty water to overflow and collect in the low-lying portions, emanating foul smell all around the residential areas.

 Residents said recently the   officials and workers had turned up and clean the sewage from the site but it is just a temporary relief.
 
 During a visit to the residential society from GHS 105-111 located in Sector 20,  , it was found that water was flushing back from the sewerage pipeline in the societies. In GHS 108 and 110, the water was spread over the area near the pipeline itself. The parking lots of the societies are facing the issue of serious waterlogging.
 
 The waterlogged areas in various societies in the locality have become breeding ground for mosquitoes. Although a pump station is installed in the area to pump out the sewage, it lies defunct, resulting in no relief to the residents there.
 
 Amarjeet Kaur Sethi, a resident of GSH 108 society said a week ago too, the MC staff had come and cleaned the sewage from the affected areas, but there is no permanent solution to it.
