INDORE: Reeling under severe financial crisis, a man strangulated his wife and committed suicide by hanging self from the ceiling of his house in   area in early hours of Friday.

 The bodies were discovered by children of the couple, who were sleeping by their mother’s side and raised an alarm for help in the morning, Aerodrome police said.
 
 Vijay Gupta, 35, his wife Babli, 30, and their kids Krishna, 8, and Himanshi, 6, had gone to sleep on the roof of their house on Thursday night.
 
 When the kids woke up, they found that their mother was not responding to their calls. After failing to wake her up, the kids moved downstairs and found the doors of the house locked, police said.
 
 Krishna saw his father through a window, hanging from the ceiling of the room and called for help, they said adding the neighbours rushed to the spot and broke the locks.
 
  “A short post-mortem report has revealed that Babli was strangulated. We suspect that Vijay killed her before committing suicide,” city superintendent of police   told TOI.
 
 The shocked children were handed over to the relatives, who claimed that Vijay was reeling under towering financial burden for the last several months.
 
 Vijay, who worked with a marketing firm some time ago, was jobless and was finding it difficult to meet the family’s expenses, they told the police.
 
 The deceased had recently sold out his motorcycle and a house in Banganga area, to raise funds for his day-to-day expenses.
 
 “We believe that Vijay had planned the murder and suicide. His daughter Himanshi had her birthday on Friday. The family celebrated the birthday on Thursday, before going to sleep,” she said.
 
 The police have sealed the house and were in the process of collecting evidence from the crime scene.
 
 Statements of family and relatives were being recorded.
