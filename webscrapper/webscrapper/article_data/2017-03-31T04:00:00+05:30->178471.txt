Rajkot: A clash broke out between two communities following an alleged rape of a minor in Savarkundla town of Amreli on Thursday. One person was injured in the clashes and was hospitalized. While one person was booked for rape of the minor girl, two cross complaints were filed by both the community members against each other where about a dozen persons were booked.

 One Zakir Bhatti was booked for the minor girl’s rape from different community on Thursday. Police said, the accused entered the girl’s house when she was alone. He first gagged her and then allegedly raped her. Police said that Zakir also threatened the girl that he would kill her brother if she complained to anybody.
 
 When the girl informed her family, they went to Zakir’s house and thrashed him. Zakir, however, managed to escape and reached temporary office of Ramnavmi committee. He suspected that Hakubhai Vala, who was in the office had told about him to the girl’s parents. So, Zakir and his half-a-dozen-friends allegedly beat him up and fled.
 
 Following the incident, all shops in the town downed shutters and people of both communities clashed with each other. One person got hurt during the clash. Police said that Zakir, Vala and one other person had to be hospitalized looking into the grievous nature of injury.
