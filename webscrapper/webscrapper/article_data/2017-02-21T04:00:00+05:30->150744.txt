VADODARA: The unions of workers and employees of the   (VMC) have threatened to tender mass resignations as a part of their ongoing agitation. 

 The unions have raised a series of demands including regular employment for contract workers and others.
 
 The unions had started their agitation last week by staging a rally on Thursday to submit a memorandum to press for their demands. They had even threatened to go on a mass casual leave (CL) on Monday. 
 
 But they dropped the plan after the VMC administration said that it was looking into their demands and was trying to resolve them. 
 
 “The administration is holding meetings and discussing the matter,” said a union leader.
 
 Union leaders claimed that around 200 persons had already signed on a letter prepared for mass resignations. 
 
 The unions are trying to get over 500 signatures on the letter before submitting it to the VMC.
 
 The unions were to become more aggressive with their agitation from Tuesday, but have decided against it for now. 
 
 The VMC will remain closed on Tuesday in wake of the death of former mayor and former minister  . Essential services will, however, continue to remain operational.
