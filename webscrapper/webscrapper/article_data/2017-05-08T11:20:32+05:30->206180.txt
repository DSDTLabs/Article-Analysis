At a time, when it's difficult for a lead actor to take time off from work to spend time with family,   has managed to do unthinkable. She has whisked her husband   away to   to celebrate their second wedding  .

 Incidentally, Ankita had informed the production house two months in advance about the leave to make sure that I got eight days off from my shoot. Talking about it, Karan says, "Ankita is a sweetheart. She would've left no stone unturned to make sure I get to celebrate our anniversary away from the madness."
 
 The holiday originally a surprise was planned by Ankita, but Karan guessed it. "Ankita wanted to tell me once they reached the airport and they were checking in but her plan failed as I guessed it way before. But it was good in a way as I could then pack my luggage appropriately (laughs!)."
