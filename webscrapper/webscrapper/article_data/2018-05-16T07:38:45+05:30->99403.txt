LUCKNOW: After a detailed probe into repeated dog attacks over the last two weeks, Sitapur administration claimed that there were around 50 wild dogs that were perpetrating the attacks on children. Officials further said that it was observed that the wild dogs usually assembled at 'Mela Maidan' near   in   and then went hunting from there. 

 Sitapur DM Sheetal Verma said that teams of forest officials, district administration and police undertook a detailed study of the attacks which had started in November 2017. 
 
 "It took us time to devise a proper strategy because initially, neither police nor administration was informed about the deaths that took place in November and January," DM Verma said."We have roped in dog catchers and are trying to capture as many dogs as we can. Our animal birth control centre has also become operational and more police and forest teams have been deployed to spot the dogs," said Verma. 
 
 Sitapur SP Sureshrao A Kulkarni told TOI, "We have identified 22 hypersensitive zones, 10 sensitive zones and 13 other zones where dog attacks have been concentrated. UP 100 vehicles will be deployed in theses zones."
 
 The fear of the killer dogs has not abated though as people are extremely watchful and are taking all precautions. Children have mostly stopped going to schools which again reported low attendance on Tuesday. "Some NGOs have joined the administration in counselling villagers to send their children to schools. We will be having summer vacation from May 19," said district inspector of schools Devki Singh.
