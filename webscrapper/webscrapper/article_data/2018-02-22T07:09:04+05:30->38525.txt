AHMEDABAD: A   busted a racket that involved   used to prepare medicines for kidney ailments. Officials seized a   of 330 grams of the powder, worth Rs 4.5 lakh, from a courier firm. The officials said that the racket may have been operational over the past year and the powder may have been used to market the medicine with a different name or to even prepare spurious medicine.

 According to Dholka town police, M N Jadeja, additional SP, Dholka division, received a complaint about theft from a Dholka company, Concord Biotech Pvt Ltd. The company reported the theft of a powder used to prepare tablets. Working on information, police apprehended Raju Vaghela, a resident of Bhetawada, Dholka, who used to work at the firm earlier.
 
 “Vaghela told us that a consignment had been sent to Mumbai recently,” said Jadeja. “We approached the courier firm and intercepted the package before it reached the destination. The consignment was addressed to Pankaj Bhavsar, a resident of Borivali, Mumbai, and it had 330 grams of the prescribed powder.”
 
 L B Tadvi, the inspector of the Dholka town police station, said that two more persons associated with the crime — Paresh Parmar and Bhavan Pandav, both residents of Ingoli village near Dholka, and formerly with the company — were also apprehended.
 
 “We are yet to ascertain how the accused managed to get the raw material stolen from the source and send it outside the manufacturing unit,” said Tadvi. “We have learnt that the powder was sent to places such as Mumbai, Vapi, Vadodara, Surendranagar and other parts of Ahmedabad district. We are identifying the receivers.”
 
 Jadeja said an inter-state gang may be involved in making spurious medicines with the stolen raw material. “As it is used for kidney ailments, wrong dosage can damage organs or have serious health implications. Thus, all the angles will be probed,” he said.
