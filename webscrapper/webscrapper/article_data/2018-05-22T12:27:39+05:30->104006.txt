SHAHJAHANPUR: In a bizarre incident, the   summoned twin brothers, aged six years, after a molestation complaint was filed against them by the father of a seven-year-old girl. The parents of the minor survivor have alleged that their daughter was molested by the boys a month ago but police refused to file an FIR. The accused minors, class I students at a primary school here, were brought to the office of the circle office (CO) by their father on Monday.
 
  The incident was reported from   village under   police station of the district. The girl’s father had lodged a complaint through the integrated grievance redressal system (IGRS). He alleged that his daughter was pushed into the bushes and physically assaulted by the twins for more than four hours.
  
  Meanwhile, the twins’ father said, “I could not believe that my neighbour would file such a grave complaint against my sons. They are innocent. I came to know about the allegations only when the police came knocking at our house.” He works as a labourer at a brick kiln in the district.
  
  Sub-inspector Mahipal Singh, who is inspecting the case, said, “Initial probe has revealed that there was a fight between the twins and the minor girl. The boys’ statements have been recorded.”
  
  While CO   remained absent on Monday, the accused twins along with their father met additional superintendent of police (ASP)  .
  
  “We are still investigating the case. The complaint filed by girl’s father appears to be false,” said ASP Tripathi.
