AHMEDABAD: Emphasizing the formation of a different regulatory framework for higher education institutions, Cept director, Bimal Patel spoke about regulations focusing on improving the quality of education, during his convocation address at   on Saturday. Some 500 students were awarded degrees at the varsity’s convocation ceremony. Some 16 doctorate degrees, 295 postgraduate degrees and 189 undergraduate degrees were awarded. Around 36 students received university-level awards for excellence in academics.

  Patel said that while regulations for matters related to admission, curriculum and finances formed by professional bodies and government departments, are underpinned by good intentions, they are often poorly structured and very rigid. This does not focus on improving the quality of education.
 
 “No attempt is made to find out if the students are actually learning or not. If the objective is ensuring that quality education is being imparted, one should focus on what students are learning. Regulators should not focus on rigidly insisting on institutions meeting input standards and should rather focus on improving quality,” said Patel. “With the current system, no attempt is made to gauge if the students are actually learning,” he added.
 
 Gandhian scholar Dr  , who is also the director and chief editor of   at   was the chief guest for the occasion.
