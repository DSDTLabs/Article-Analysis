While the general perception is that most romantic comedies are hero-centric, Arjun   stresses on the fact that, it’s the leading lady who should take charge as opposed to her male counterpart in films of this genre. His belief can’t be misplaced as the actor, who won critical acclaim for his turn as   in last year’s hard-hitting and gritty gangster saga, 'Daddy', is thinking of producing a   next. Even as he admits that he’s drawn to stories rooted in reality,   seems to have decided to change tracks for his next. He says, “It’s an interesting story — a love tale that revolves around different generations of people. I’m only thinking of producing it; I don’t think I will be acting in it. The film will require a good and experienced actress.” 
 
 Given his undoubtedly good looks and acting chops to boot, Arjun would make for the ideal leading man in a romcom. So, why doesn’t he want to act in the film? He promptly replies, “I have nothing against romantic comedies as long as they are driven by the leading lady.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the actor-producer seems undeterred by 'Daddy' not drawing in the crowds at the cinemas, even though he had hoped that it would. “We got good reviews. It is a unique film and I am proud to be associated with it as a producer and an actor. The film is getting nominations in all departments of filmmaking. We went out to do something with integrity and it’s been appreciated,” says Arjun. Admitting that he was disappointed that the movie didn’t do well outside Maharashtra, he sums it up, saying, “People didn’t go into the theatres to watch the film in the North and the South. Perhaps, they didn’t connect with the character. As a producer, it was disappointing that the film didn’t get the box office going, though it was good. But you live and learn.”
