Chandigarh: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday demanded Rs 50 lakh   and a job each to the families of 39 Indian youths killed by the Islamic State in Iraq, including 27 from Punjab. AAP also demanded apology from the Prime Minister as well as from the Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj from Indians for failing to protect Indian hostages and declaring the news of their death so late.

 Leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly and AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira said, “It is unfortunate that a responsible minister of the Government of India had given statements in both Houses of Parliament in the last two years and assurance to victims’ parents.”
 
 Khaira added that victims’ parents were being called to Delhi to present them before the media and the central government was trying to take credit of the situation. Sunam MLA Aman Arora said, “Modi government has done politics over 39 killed Indians.“Prime Minister as well as Sushma Swaraj should apologise to the countrymen.”
