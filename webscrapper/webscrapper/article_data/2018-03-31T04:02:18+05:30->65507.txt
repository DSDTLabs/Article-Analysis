MUMBAI: The Bombay high court recently directed municipal commissioner   to personally file a reply on the  's stand on hawkers who cook on the roadside. 

  The direction by a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla was passed on an Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association petition urging the BMC to take action against hawkers who cook in the open. Its petition said these hawkers do not possess requisite licences to conduct business and yet easily gain access to gas, water and power. They said this is in violation of the high court's October 2015 order that bans cooking on roads. 
 
  On February 26, the judges noted that deputy superintendent (licences) Neela Patange had blamed IHRA for not making suppliers of gas cylinders and electricity as parties in the petition, instead of visiting the spots to see if the hawkers were illegal cooking. They directed Mehta to "either file personally or nominate" an officer not below the rank of additional commissioner "to look into the manner, on which" Patange had replied. 
 
 Perusing additional municipal commissioner ( ) A L Jarhad's affidavit at the March 19 hearing, the judges were miffed that "the officer has not even bothered to read the affidavit". They said Jarhad "was required to apply his mind and state whether the municipal corporation is supporting the stand taken in the affidavit (of Patange)" or wants to withdraw it. "Considering that the officer has completely overlooked the order of this court, we have no option but to direct the municipal commissioner himself to file the affidavit," it said, seeking Mehta's reply on April 3.
