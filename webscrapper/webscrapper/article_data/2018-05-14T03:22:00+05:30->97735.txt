Margao: A section of Raia residents decried the ‘haste’ in which the Sunday gram sabha had been convened by the Raia panchayat.  Former Raia sarpanch and panch member Zelia Gonsalves told TOI that the panchayat had not served the notice of the gram sabha meeting properly, eight days in advance, and nor was it properly announced, thus resulting in most villagers being unaware about it. When contacted, deputy sarpanch Mario D’Souza denied the allegations.  The meeting was opposed on the basis of lack of quorum. Villagers also complained about getting just one day to submit their proposals to the sarpanch The gram sabha was chaired by Raia sarpanch Esmerada Gomes. All 11 panchas were in attendance At the meeting the panchayat secretary read out the annual budget. However, the administrative report was not read out.
