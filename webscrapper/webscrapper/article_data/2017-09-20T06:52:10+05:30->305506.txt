AHMEDABAD: IGP  , currently posted as additional director of anti-corruption bureau ( ), has written to in-charge director general of police (DGP), Geetha Johri, indicating loopholes in ‘overcrowded’ police deployments for VVIP protection. This is revealed in a letter making the rounds on social media. However, there has been no official confirmation of such a letter.

 The letter dated September 8 reads: “After being deployed at Prime Minsiter’s rally in   on May 22, I want to draw your attention to some issues. It has been observed that the number of police officials and staff has been gradually increased. Earlier, the superintendent (of police) was given supervision but now various senior officials are given that charge.”
 
 “Instead of deploying limited police force under the guidance of IGP or SP, the focus remains on deploying police personnel in large numbers,” the letter says. It further points out that overdeployment neither ensures commitment from local officers nor from officers of other districts. “For example, in-charge range IG did not turn up for security rehearsal before the Bhachau meeting,” the letter says.
