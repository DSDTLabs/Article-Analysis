LUCKNOW: UP   president   on Wednesday dismissed reports that he had resigned from his post. But he was quick to add, “Changes are bound to happen as a new president has taken over the party. Though I have not resigned, I am open to any role given to me in the new beginning.” On Tuesday night, rumours of Babbar’s resignation had created a buzz. 

 
 Babbar’s tweet from his official handle had created more confusion. In his tweet, Babbar quoted a poem by Hindi poet  , “Ant mein mitron, itna hi kahunga ki ant mahaz ek muhavara hai, jise shabd hamesha apne visfot se uda dete hain (In the end, I would like to say that the end is a mere proverb...)” 
 
 “My tweet has been misinterpreted. I was paying tributes to deceased poet Kedarnath Singh. The lines I chose to pay homage to him were most striking lines by him in my opinion. I had clearly mentioned this in the tweet,” he said. Congress also denied reports that Babbar had quit. 
 
 Making a statement on behalf of the party,   MP   said, “All reports stating that Babbar has resigned from the post of party chief are baseless.” Tewari said rumours of Babbar’s resignation were aimed at maligning the image of the party.
