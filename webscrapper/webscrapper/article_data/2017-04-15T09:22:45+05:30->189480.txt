MUMBAI: APM Terminals Pipavav has achieved a milestone of handling 100,000 cars at the port’s Roll On-Roll Off (Ro/Ro) facility, 20 months after beginning auto-loading and discharging operations. 

 Ro/Ro services were started at the port in August 2015 after   (NALI) invested a modern stock yard and pre-delivery inspection facility.
 
 “With USD $3 billion investment expected by automobiles companies in Gujarat by 2020, more than two million passenger vehicles are projected to be produced in the region in the next five to six years. Most of the manufacturing in Gujarat is for the Indian export market,” said Keld Pederson, managing director, APM Terminals.
 
 India’s passenger car exports have grown by 46% over the previous five years to a record 654,000 in 2016. Gujarat is home to manufacturing facilities of such global automotive industry giants as US-based   and General Motors, Japanese-based Suzuki Motors, and Indian-based  . 
 
 “With the Indian government’s “Make in India” initiative, we have seen a surge in automotive manufacturing investment in the Sanand, Hansalpur and   belt in Gujarat, and our modern and efficient Ro/Ro facility can play a major role in India’s emergence as a major automotive exporter” said Pederson said.
