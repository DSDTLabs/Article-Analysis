CHANDIGARH: A car zipping through a   around Thursday noon almost took away the foot of paramilitary force sub-inspector Jai Bhagwan, 48, who thought he was taking a safe path to Sector 16 from Sector 10.

 This   ( ) officer from the personal security ring of a Punjab and Haryana high court judge in Sector 16 was trying to get to his post when the accident happened. Passersby moved him to the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research) before they called over his family from Sector 16 and cops from Sector 17.
 
 Red Cross Society ambulance driver   who saw it happen said the car was so fast that he couldn’t even note down its registration number. All he knows is that it was white. Jai Bhagwan told his rescuers that he served at a judge’s house. Santosh was in the group that moved him to hospital, where doctors operated upon his broken foot and called over cops from the Sector 3 station to record his statement. They have registered a case against the car driver and began a hunt for him.
 
 Since no security camera was deployed near the scene, police have to rely on just half a registration number that the eyewitnesses are able to provide. Tracing the car is not going to be easy.
 
 The crossing where the accident happened is fitted with Pelican lights. A pelican crossing is has a standard set of traffic lights facing the oncoming traffic, with a push button and two illuminated, colour-coded pictograms facing the pedestrians.
