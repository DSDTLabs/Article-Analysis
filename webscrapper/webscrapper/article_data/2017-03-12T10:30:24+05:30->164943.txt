CHANDIGARH: Rivalry or not, but   CM-pick Capt   and their new star   stand next to each other on the tally tabsle with the score of biggest victory margins after Saturday's results to Punjab 2017 polls. 

 While Amarinder's margin from Patiala Urban seat is 52,407 votes, Sidhu's victory margin from Amritsar East seat is 42,809 votes. None in the Congress or SAD are even close to their margins.
 
 Though Sidhu was quick to scotch talks of being deputy chief ministerial candidate, his decision to hold a press conference of his own left everyone confused. This was much before Amarinder himself addressed the media, along with Congress Punjab affairs in -charge Asha Kumari and deputy Harish Choudhary.
 
 Much like their on-and-off camaraderie before and after Sidhu's January 17 entry into Congress, there was some palpable soft corner for each other.
 
 Sidhu dedicated Congress' stellar tally to Amarinder, saying" This is Amarinder's win, not Rahul's (Gandhi) win."
 
 When asked about Sidhu, Amarinder said the decision would be left to Congress high command.
 
 "We will certainly give our recommendation, but the final decision lies with Rahul and others," Amarinder told the reporters in Chandigarh.
 
 Later when asked about his role in the Congress, he merely said "This is the victory of my faith and a New Year gift to Congress. My pagri (turban) was on the line."
 
 He insisted that this is the revival of the Congress and that the Congress will now revive Punjab.
 
 "It is just the beginning. The Congress will spread out from here," he said, without givng much hint on what role he will play.
