CHANDIGARH: A cluster of old dumpsters located right next to a park in   residential area have become an eyesore for a large number for the residents who live nearby and also visit the park in the morning and the evening. 

 The dumpsters are large in size, but still seem inadequate in accommodating the overwhelming amount of   that is seen to remain spread around them.
 
 The hatches of the dumpsters are seen to be covered with rotten domestic waste infested with flies and mosquitoes, that gives them a rather ugly appearance. 
 
 “This is one of the big parks here and a large number of people from the sector and the nearby residential blocks visit it. But the foul odour has become an serious problem. The smell is intoxicating and it is much more strong during the early mornings and late evenings,” said  , a resident. 
 
 The scattered garbage has also started eating into the space of the pavement creating a series of problems for the pedestrians. They are left with no option to walk on the the road. The garbage is rich in plastic waste, vegetable and fruit peels among other forms of solid and liquid waste. 
 
 “I do not know why the safaikaramcharis are irregular in cleaning this spot despite tons of garbage strewn all over the place. Very rarely do we get to see the garbage being collected from here. This is annoying,” said another resident under condition of anonymity.
