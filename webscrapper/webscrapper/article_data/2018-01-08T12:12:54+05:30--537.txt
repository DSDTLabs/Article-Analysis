  had done enough against   FC to at least get a point, if not more, feels chief coach  .
 
  The Goan franchise lost 1-2 against NorthEast United, who had lost five matches in a row. But the visiting coach felt FC Goa deserved something out of this game, given the number of chances they created.
  
  “Obviously, we were tired. Even though we were tired, we went out there, we played well, we worked hard, we created a lot of chances, but I think   is a little unjust with us because we didn’t deserve to lose this game,” Lobera told reporters at the   stadium in Guwahati on Sunday.
  
  Lobera made four changes to his regular team which fought all odds to steal a point against ATK in their previous clash. Man-of-the-Match Edu Bedia and defender Bruno Pinheiro were sacrificed to accommodate Sergio Juste and Manuel Arana, while defenders Narayan Das and Mohammad Ali had to make way for Chinglensana Singh and Pronay Halder.
  
  The changes meant Mandar Rao Desai started as left-back and midfield general Ahmed Jahouh was without his trusted aide Edu. FC Goa struggled initially to impose themselves and the struggling NorthEast had the last laugh.
  
  “Changes were there because we had to make changes. For me, the players’ health is of utmost importance. Mandar (Rao Dessai) did play left-back but this is not the first time he’s played there. But I’ll repeat, we created a lot of chances, we failed to take them. The other team scored from their chances.
  
  “I don’t think they (NorthEast) surprised us. They didn’t play any differently to what they have played throughout the league. They just had more chances and they took them,” said Lobera.
  
  FC Goa now return home and will face Jamshedpur FC in their next match at home on Thursday. The Goan side has picked up just a point from their last three matches.
