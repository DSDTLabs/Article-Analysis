HYDERABAD: Even as the state government on Monday began an orientation programme for tehsildars to act as ex-officio sub-registrars to facilitate property registrations, employee associations of both revenue and registration departments opposed the move. Employees are getting ready to take up the matter with the chief secretary and special chief secretary (revenue) on Tuesday.

 Chief Minister   had recently said all tehsildar offices will be converted into sub-registrar offices. On Monday, the revenue department began a two-day training programme for first batch of tehsildars, presided over by deputy chief minister Mohd Mahmood Ali.
 
 “Telangana government created 125 new mandals last year and many of them have been running in two to three rooms. Of 582 mandals, 100 tehsildar offices have been running in dilapidated buildings and another 100 do not have proper telephone and Internet services. Our association opposes the government move in present conditions,” V  , president of   Tehsildars’ Association told TOI.
 
 Sub-Registrars’ Association said delegation of powers to tehsildars may cause problems with respect to duties, availability, financial burden. “Even a small error in registration process may lead to legal problems as once a document is registered it can only be rectified and cancelled by a civil court. Second, all sub-registrars go through one-year training under Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act and act as additional sub-registrar in registration office,” said  , president of United Registration Employees’ Association. Both associations said state government did not consult them.
