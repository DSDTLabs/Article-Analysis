CHENNAI: A 59-year-old godman from Guduvanchery was arrested on Sunday on charges of sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman. He had been allegedly threatening her with dire consequences if she brought it to the notice of her family members. 

 The arrested man was identified as Annadurai alias Annamalai Sidhar who had been running an ashram in Anna Nagar in Guduvanchery for more than five years. Sidhar advertised his services online and had at least 5000 followers on social networking sites.
 
 Police said that the woman had a severe migraine and went to the ashram in January on the advice of her grandmother who accompanied her. Sidhar spoke to them for a couple of minutes after which he asked her to come alone the next day. Sidhar, who kept her in the ashram for more than an hour, listened to her problem and then sexually assaulted her. 
 
 "When the woman objected to this and warned him that she would expose his act, Sidhar told her that he would use his powers to make her son a paralytic," said an investigating officer. He also told her that he would hire men to kill her husband. The woman was intimidated by his threats and and kept the matter to herself.
 
 Her husband grew suspicious since she became withdrawn and showed signs of depression. Though he kept questioning her, she was worried that Sidhar would carry out his threats. Later, however, she was persuaded to reveal what happened to her. The woman's husband lodged a complaint with Guduvanchery police who arrested Sidhar and sealed his ashram.
