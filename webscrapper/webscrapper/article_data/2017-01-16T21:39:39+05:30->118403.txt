The   Pathinaaru team is one happy lot. They have been flooded with congratulatory messages from the public and the people in the film industry. And the fact that the film���s screen count has almost doubled in its second week has given them cause for celebration.

 ���When we released on the first day (December 29), we had got only 95 screens. And most of the theatres had given us only one show, mainly the matinee show. However, right from the first show, the film started receiving good response, and the word-of-mouth only became bigger and bigger as stalwarts in the industry started praising our film on social media. This week, the screen count has gone up to 160, with most theatres slotting us in their main screens and playing the film for all four shows. The evening and night shows, especially, are running housefull,��� gushes the film���s co-producer and promoter, Venus Infotainment KJ Ganesh.
 
 He adds that the film, directed by debutant Karthick Naren and starring  , is drawing crowds even in tier-two cities and towns. And since there is a theatre strike in Kerala, people in that state who are living along the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border are travelling to theatres in border towns like Bodi, Kambam, Theni to catch the film after coming across positive reviews of the film online.
