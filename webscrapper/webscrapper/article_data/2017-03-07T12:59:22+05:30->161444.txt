HYDERABAD: The   (RTO) authorities will hold a special drive on March 8 for aspiring   drivers who can book a test slot for a Learner's License). The state transport department has set aside March 8, on the occasion of International Women's Day, exclusively for women applicants. The idea is to encourage women to get behind the wheel.

 The number of women driving license holders in the city as on date is 1.2 lakh as compared to 20.6 lakh men who hold driving licenses. Despite accounting for a approximately 5 per cent of the total licensees, these women drivers represent an exponential growth compared to their numbers 10 years ago, say experts. “Although the numbers are increasing by 1000-1500 year on year, we want to encourage more women to come forward and apply for licenses since mobility is an important part of women's empowerment. We will hold the day-long special drive at the five RTOs,“ pointed out J Panduranga Naik,  .
