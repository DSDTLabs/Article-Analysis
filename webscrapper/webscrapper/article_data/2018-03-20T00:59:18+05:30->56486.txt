New Delhi: Upset over the remarks made by former Karnataka DGP and Ex-MLA  , Nirbhaya’s mother wrote an open letter saying that the sacrifice of her daughter was in vain. Speaking to TOI, she said that the former DGP has reiterated something that one of the convicts, Mukesh, had said during a television interview. 

 Sangliana had commented that Nirbhaya’s mother had a ‘good physique’ and he couldn’t imagine how beautiful Nirbhaya would have been. Though, he later clarified that the statement was taken out of context. Nirbhaya’s mother said that she was present at the programme while he made the comment, which shocked her. “It was a programme organised for women. Imagine someone telling this about your daughter who is no more. What did the ex-DGP mean by saying that” she said.
 
 Nirbhaya’s parents had travelled to Bengaluru on an invite from a women’s rights group.
