NAGPUR: The   ( ) assistant commissioner of   zone,  , has issued show cause notices to deputy engineer RV Mule and junior engineer   in the   cement concrete road case. Also, Laxmi Nagar zone chairman Prakash   has stayed the process to pay the private contractor for the works done before administrative approval and tendering process.

 TOI had, on February 17, exposed irregularities in construction of a cement concrete road at Rahate Colony. NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone engineers had constructed the road on land owned by a private person, without any administrative approval or tendering process. Engineers got the works done through a private contractor. The road was constructed on the demand of an influential citizen, to facilitate a car repairing and servicing centre in the residential area, adjacent to a government girls hostel and kindergarten school.
 
 Dakhane told TOI Mule and   have been directed to conduct inspection and submit their replies. “Notices have been issued following a report in TOI. Appropriate action will be taken after receiving the replies,” she said.
 
 Bhoyar said further decision on tendering process and payment to contractor will be taken after completion of inquiry.
 
 However, no decision has been taken to prevent civil works like cement concrete road etc being completed using ward and zonal funds meant for emergency works. Some 156 corporators are allowed to propose works of Rs25 lakh each every year under ward fund. The 10 zones are permitted to propose works worth Rs6.50 crore per annum under zonal funds.
 
 Corporators and engineers at the zones are executing works of cement concrete road, interlocking tiles etc under ward and zonal funds, though these are not emergency works. These works are also allowed to be executed by inviting only quotations from private contractors, without going through the tendering process. Therefore, zones are engaged in preparing proposals below maximum permissible limit by dividing works into parts.
