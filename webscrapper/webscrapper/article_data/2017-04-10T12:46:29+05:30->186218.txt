GURUGRAM: In what has been labeled as an act of ‘moral policing’, the   in Sector 28 has said that unmarried youngsters living in rented accommodations at the residential society will not be allowed to host friends from the opposite sex at their homes. While the tenants have questioned the move, the   said the “youngsters have brought it upon themselves by creating ruckus in the society in the odd hours”.

 Expressing ire, a tenant Raj Gopal took to   questioning the restrictions. “It was on Friday that three of our female friends were visiting me and my two roommates. The society earlier had a rule that the women are not allowed at a bachelor’s house after 10pm. However, they left at around 12.30pm. Next morning the guards came to our house to question about them,” he told TOI. He told the guards that his friends had left last night. On Sunday, Gopal, a retail analyst by profession, saw a notice that was put up by the society which elaborated about the new restrictions.
 
 Meanwhile, the young people living in the area have dubbed the move as moral policing. Justifying the imposition of restrictions, the RWA members said they took the step after there were several incidents where the male and female visitors created ruckus in the society.
 
 “We had to wake up in the middle of the night and resolve issues all the time. Even the senior citizens living in the area were being troubled, so we had to take this decision,” said Rajeev Sinha, RWA president, Essel Towers. He added the association and house owners in the society have further decided to not rent flats to unmarried youngsters. “If required, the tenants presently residing in the society may be asked to leave,” Sinha said. This is not the first time that a society RWA in Gurgaon imposed such restrictions. Last year, the   also imposed such rules on the tenants.
