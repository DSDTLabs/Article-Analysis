When TOI contacted principal secretary, industries, Alok Sinha, he said that he had ordered for a regular audit and not any special audit.

 The CAG was specifically looking to audit the accounts of Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) after complaints. But, the SP government didn’t allow. The Yogi government after coming to power in March had already allowed CAG to audit GDA’s accounts. Now, it is learnt that the CAG has have completed its investigations and have found serious cases of corruption. Its report on the GDA would be submitted soon.
