n an interview to a publication,   opened up like never before about his son  , who is making his debut in films soon, with  's film Aadi. "I never knew what he would become. I have never desired that he should be something either," he said.

 "He grew up in hostels throughout. He led a simple life, within the four walls of a room. Even when he was working as assistant director in my film, he chose a simple accomodation. His world has always been one of simplicity and he has never asked for more."
 
 He said that he has given his children all freedom and they could have chosen the path of drugs and even hidden it but they never did. "I have always felt that parents should never desire something for their children. My father used to tell me to take a degree. I didn't have to tell Pranav even that. They have been brought up in great discipline. They have their bath at 7 pm, go to sleep at 10 and have bananas and idli for breakfast."
 
 He also added that the children confided in their mother more, as they saw him only rarely.
