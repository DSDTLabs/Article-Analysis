 “When we asked them about the reason for staying in the open, they said it was cool and pleasant outside.
 
 “The fans inside the shelter were not sufficient for them, they said. So, they found it more comfortable sleeping in the open,” said Bhaskara Chary, additional commissioner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). He added that the patient’s attendants were counselled by the officials.
