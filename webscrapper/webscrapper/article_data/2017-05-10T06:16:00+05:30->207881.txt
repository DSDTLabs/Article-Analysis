Mumbai: The municipal corporation’s plan for a pedestrian pathway from   (CST) subway to MG Road junction on   is in limbo owing to unavailability of land.

 As a result, the civic body might have to foreclose the road widening work because the period of contract for it ends on May 31. 
 
 The chief engineer (roads) has written to the local ward office that improving/widening of the road cannot be undertaken as the setback portion of the stretch has not been handed over yet. “It is learned that the ownership of the plot under reference vests with the collector, Mumbai and has submitted the papers to the urban development department/revenue department regarding handing over of open setback land to the MCGM (  of Greater Mumbai). As such only after the receipt of the sanction from the state government about handing over of setback land to the MCGM further development can be undertaken,” reads the notice sent by the roads department. 
 
 The   had plans of converting the widened portion into a pedestrian pathway, with an artistic canopy, in consultation with the Heritage Committee to suit the nearby heritage precincts.
 
 A civic official said the BMC standing committee had cleared the proposal in October last year on the condition that the civic body would widen the entire stretch till MG Road junction and not stop a little before the Azad Maidan entrance as it was proposed. “While the existing road is 50ft, we had plans to widen it to 80ft,” said the official. 
 
 With this being the situation, Bombay Gymkhana authorities can heave a sigh of relief as BMC had proposed extending the pedestrian pathway till the end of the gymkhana. The civic body had informed the collector around 2,000-sq m area would be needed from the gymkhana. It was learnt that a heritage bungalow on the premises was to be affected due to this widening work.
