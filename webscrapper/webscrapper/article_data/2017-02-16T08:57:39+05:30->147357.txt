IMPHAL: Youngsters of Manipur have hit upon many innovative ways of campaigning for free and fair election. 

 A day after renowned rock bands belted out their most popular numbers at a 'ballot jam' event to educate youths on the importance of ethical voting, 20 young models took out a road show on free and fair polls in Imphal valley on Wednesday.
 
 Drawn from across the state, the models - 16 girls and four boys - distributed pamphlets and leaflets on the need for transparent polls and also interacted with the people.
 
 Organized by Blue Wings, a popular fashion events management group of the state, the road show saw the models take part in one programme after another at the palace compound, Singjamei, Kwakeithel, Khwairamband market,   and Ningthoukong markets. They also spoke on the need to save wildlife in the state.
 
 "Today's programme was successful. We met a large number of people of different age groups in different places. Thus, we created awareness on the need to understand our democratic rights and exercise them in a meaningful manner," said Blue Wings manager  .
 
 "We carried our programmes under the aegis of the district election officer of Imphal East and Imphal West. We talked to police personnel, women vendors, traffic control police, autorickshaw drivers and pedestrians. They were very happy with our approach," said Nishikanta.
 
 Tuesday's 'ballot jam' was organized by Youth Street News and saw a large turnout of students and youths. During the numerous intervals of the show, the state's youth icons delivered speeches on the value of voting and the need to exercise this right responsibly.
 
 Under the   and Electoral Participation campaign, various other bodies have also organized programmes like painting and essay competitions on informed and ethical voting.
