BAREILLY: Atiya Sabari, a Saharanpur woman who had approached the   challenging   given on a piece of paper by her husband, said she had voted for the BJP and now it was the party's turn to bring justice to women whose lives had "become hell" due to the Sharia law. She told TOI that thousands of Muslim women in circumstances similar to hers had supported the saffron party, and now awaited justice. 

 While expressing delight over the BJP's unprecedented mandate in UP, Sabari said, "Triple talaq is a nightmare for any Muslim woman. Our Prime Minister had showed all Muslim women a ray of hope by saying that the practice should be opposed. So we voted for him and his party. I am extremely glad with BJP's remarkable victory in the state and I believe that the time has come for all Muslim women to get justice." She added that her entire family and relatives too had voted for the party.
 
 In her petition to the apex court in January, the 30-year-old woman had made Darul Uloom seminary a party alleging it did not hear her before issuing a fatwa validating triple talaq. She had also made her ex-husband, in-laws and the Union government parties in her petition. The SC had asked the attorney general to file a consolidated submission of all such cases by March 30.
