Director Anzar Khan’s upcoming thriller   had been shooting at breakneck speed till an unscheduled break recently due to an injury to one of its lead actors.

 The film, which has   and   playing convicts, was last shot in Athirappilly where Biju Menon suffered a hand injury.
 
 The movie’s director tells us, “We were filming a running sequence that required Biju Menon to hurtle over the rocks. He somehow slipped and fell on his hands. All of us thought he was fine and resumed the shoot that day. But by next morning he experienced a shooting pain. He had the hand scanned and it revealed a hairline fracture.”
 Anzar reveals that Biju Menon was ready to shoot after a day’s break but the team was not willing to risk it. “There are still a few more action scenes so we couldn’t risk him aggravating the injury. We have put the schedule on hold for a week till he recovers,” says the director.
 
 The team though is upbeat that the shoot is progressing as planned and the minor hiccup will not affect the schedules much. The film, scripted by  , is based on Anzar’s telefilm Mukham-ukham that is about two convicts who are being transported from Peermade to Ernakulam.
 
 “We have already finished shooting more than 50% of the movie, which includes the flashback sequences. Right now we are shooting the forest scenes,” says Anzar, adding that the team will also be filming in Malayatoor, Vagamon and Thommankuthu.
