MUMBAI: Railway authorities had come in for scathing criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) in 2016 for delays in executing 53 crucial projects on the Mumbai suburban railway network – 32 on   and 21 on   -- which not only led to cost increases but endangered the safety of lakhs of commuters. A year later, little progress has been made on the projects that were either slow-moving or stalled.

 Works under the   (MUTP) II in particular, which involve replacement of rakes and crucially the segregation of the mail/express and suburban corridors by laying additional lines on Central Railway and Western Railway are nowhere close to completion though it was hoped progress would be made at least after the CAG’s censure.
 
 The CAG had in its August 2016 report on Mumbai, which reviewed works between 2010 and 2015, noted that “status of works in CR revealed that out of 43 works undertaken on Mumbai suburban (network), there was time overrun in respect of 26 ranging from one month to 69 months as compared to the original date of completion.
