Researchers at SAFAR attributed the lower pollution levels to weather conditions. “This year, the wind speed was more and hence, the pollutants were carried out of the city. This kept the AQI in check despite New Year’s firecrackers. The temperatures too have not been very low, which is good for pollution levels,” said  , project director, SAFAR.
 
 Also, this year, there were fewer firecracker hows on New Year’s Eve. “There has definitely been a lot of awareness about use of firecrackers and it is visible in the sales. This year, the political leadership too had asked people from refraining from bursting firecrackers,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener of Awaaz Foundation, an NGO that has been tracking noise levels in Mumbai.
