LUDHIANA:   police have detained two persons, after they recovered 1kg   brick from their possession at the High Tech checkpost on Doraha Canal, around 20km from here. The persons were identified as Manav Kapoor of Thapra Mohalla on Daresi Road, and Arun Kumar Sharma of Shivaji Nagar in Ludhiana.

 Khanna police said that as part of a big state-wide campaign against drug peddling, 14 special checkposts were set up on rivers and bridges across the state for 24 hours. It added that two such special checkposts were set at Neelon Canal bridge and Doraha Canal bridge under its jurisdiction. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Khanna, Navjot Singh, said the in-charge of each checkpost was an inspector-rank officer, adding that the Vehicle Vahaan app was used to check the numbers of vehicles.
 
 Khanna police said as part of the campaign, at around 3pm on Thursday, a police team led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Investigation Ranjeet Singh, and SHO Doraha   were checking vehicles at the High Tech checkpost at Doraha Canal bridge. The team saw a  , bearing registration number PB10FW-4403, coming from Khanna side. Police said the vehicle — in which Manav was driving the vehicle, and Arun sitting on the seat next to him — was stopped on suspicion. 
 
 The police officials said after checking Manav’s coat, they recovered a gold brick weighing 1kg from his pocket, for which the duo could not produce a document. Khanna cops said they were detained, and   officials informed about the matter to carry forward the investigation.
