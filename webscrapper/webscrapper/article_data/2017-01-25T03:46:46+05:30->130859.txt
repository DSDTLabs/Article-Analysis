NAVI MUMBAI: Animal activists have pointed out at a strange contradiction with regard to the entry of animals, especially dogs, at   in sector 17, Vashi.

 The NMMC signboard at the main entrance states ‘animals are strictly prohibited’ but there are several signboards inside telling visitors ‘if your dog poops, please scoop’.
 
 “It is ironical that NMMC is not allowing any animal to enter the park and but signs inside ask people to scoop up their pets’ poop. It is wrong to prohibit animals from civic parks,” said activist Arati Chauhan of   (NMAPC). 
 
 She added that around a year-and-half ago, a similar situation had arisen at R R Patil civic garden in sector 19A, Nerul, where NMMC had prohibited animals’ entry but removed it later.
 
 Vashi resident Rashmi Bansal, who tweeted a picture of the   at the Vashi park, said that she will scoop her pet’s poop . “Since the civic notice at the entrance bars the entry of animals, I am confused as to which rule to follow,” she added.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan said that various NMMC rules and signboards primarily with regard to restriction of animals have been put up at various civic parks after taking many factors into consideration. 
 
 Another official said that the rule was formulated since some citizens are against the entry of animals in parks.
 
 Municipal veterinary officer, Vaibhav Zunzare, said, “We are trying to construct a special dog park for the benefit of animal lovers and pet owners.”
