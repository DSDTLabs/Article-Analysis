Over the course of our lives we will undoubtedly acquire a collection of books – provided you still believe in reading. Roman statesman and scholar Marcus Cicero famously said: “A room without books is like a body without a soul.” Little wonder then, that the home bookspace design is getting some thought, more than just buying a bookshelf and populating it. 

 
 
 
  From irregular shelves, modern minimalistic design with single or double shelves to the plain classic bookshelf that can be used to display art and photographs – bookspaces at homes are as diverse as the books they hold. Interior designer Vipul Amar feels that just like books, bookshelves too tell a story. “Bookshelves speak volumes about the families and their personal milestones as each book is a narrative of an era. But the spaces in the houses are shrinking and one has to get creative with  ,” he says. 
 
 Homeowners, today, use hidden spaces — under the stairs, behind doors — to stock books. Use colourful and peppy shelves in children’s room and keep elegant teakwood for the living room.
 
  
 
 
  In most  , bookshelves are custom made. Interior design expert Neerja Mehra mentions that bookshelves add intellectual design to the space. “The idea is to give every room a creatively inspiring space. Your bedroom can have a smaller bookcase and you can keep changing the books there. But don’t overload your shelf. Keep it neat as it will communicate what you read, who you are, and what you love,” she says. Mehra suggests designing your shelf in a way that maximises utility. Use the space for books, objet d’art or vases and photos. Painting or wallpapering the back of the bookshelves adds drama to your displays. Don’t align books uniformly. Get creative – stack some books horizontally, put some plants in the middle and play around with other books vertically.
