'American Pie' actor Seann   said making a career in comedy genre was never his ambition. The 40-year-old actor shot to fame as   in the hit 'American Pie' franchise and since the first movie was released back in 1999, Scott has starred in a number of successful comedy movies.

 "I'm actually starting a movie, 'Green Dolphin', though that's my first drama. When I first moved to LA to be an actor it never occurred to me to do comedies. I didn't even really watch comedies."
 
 "I grew up watching   movies and Kubrick and, just dark. And then I did 50 'American Pie' movies," Scott said. The actor, however, feels his journey in   has been incredible. 
 
 "I feel like I've won the lottery. I'm a huge film fan, so the fact that I've been able to have a career making films is pretty incredible. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world on 'American Pie', and every movie I've done since I've gotten luckier."
