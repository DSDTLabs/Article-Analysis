BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister   on Thursday said that he is certain that   will emerge victorious in upcoming Mungaoli bypoll. He said that he would himself work as an MLA of Mungaoli, along with BJP candidate Baisaab Yadav, to bring development in the area. 

 Chouhan said that the BJP government would complete the developmental work of the last four years in the next six months after winning the seat. "When Baisaab will be elected MLA from Mungaoli, a new history of development will be written. This is an election for six months and we will make up for the loss of four-and-a-half years in coming six months", said Chouhan, while addressing workers at a convention in Mungaoli. 
 
 The chief minister also assured that the government will monitor developmental works in Mungaoli through a minister along with senior officials.

"After winning the bypoll, I will appoint a minister to work for Mungaoli and an officer at the chief minister's official residence to take care of the workers from Mungaoli visiting the state capital. Baisaab is not alone. The entire BJP team is with her. I myself would assist her as an MLA of Mungaoli", said Chouhan.
 
 Earlier, it was planned that the BJP candidates would file their nominations on Thursday. However, both the candidates - Baisaab Yadav and Devendra Jain (for Mungaoli and Kolaras respectively) would now file their nominations on February 6.
