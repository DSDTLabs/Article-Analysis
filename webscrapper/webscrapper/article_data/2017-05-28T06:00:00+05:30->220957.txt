All set to foray in Tamil cinema with director AL Vijay’s upcoming film, Naga Shaurya is pleased as punch. For starters he’s “glad to be back on the film set after a 9-month-long hiatus”. “I haven’t been on a film set for over nine months since completing   last year. So it felt great to put the grease paint on again,” says the Vijayawada boy who recently returned to Hyderabad after completing the first shooting schedule the film in Chennai.
 “I okayed the film in one sitting,” says the actor. He isn’t so forthcoming when it comes to talking more about his role though. “I play a Chennai boy,” reveals Shaurya reluctantly. We prod more. “It’s a thriller. No way I’m telling anything more, ” adds the actor who is paired opposite   in the film.
  That’s not all though. He has got two more Telugu films lined up. “I’m also working on a rom com directed by Venky, a former assistant of   garu. Rashmika Mandanna is playing the female lead in it,” he says adding, “Then there is Ammammagari Illu. I play a city boy who goes back to his village to meet his extended family.”
