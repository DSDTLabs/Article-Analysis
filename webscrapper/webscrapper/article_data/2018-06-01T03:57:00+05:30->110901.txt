AHMEDABAD: The father of India’s space programme, Dr Vikram Sarabhai, will get his first statue outside scientific institutions he set up in Ahmedabad. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has given the nod to install a statue of Sarabhai on the Sabarmati riverfront, just outside his residence in  .

 The land has been provided by the Sarabhai family. The statue will come up on the exact spot where Sarabhai used to place his table and chair to work. The statue, in which Sarabhai will be shown seated, will allow people to sit alongside and take selfies. CEE founder and trustee of the Sabarmati Ashram, Kartikeya Sarabhai, said: “The statue will be of Dr Sarabhai in a sitting posture with a table in front of him. The statue will come up at his favourite spot.” 
 
 Municipal commissioner   said: “Dr Sarabhai was an innovator, entrepreneur, and thinker apart from being the father of India’s space programme. He made Ahmedabad the cradle of India’s space programme.” 
 
 For many years, the Sabarmati riverbank was Sarabhai’s favourite place to unwind and think. After he established two pioneering institutes — the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) — after 1945, he used to call his colleagues home to discuss projects. The discussions were held in the open space.
