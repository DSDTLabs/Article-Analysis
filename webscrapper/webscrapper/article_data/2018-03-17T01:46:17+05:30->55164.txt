NEW DELHI: The   opened with protests from   MLAs over the presence of transport minister Kailash   in the House despite the latter being disqualified as a legislator by Election Commission of India in the office-of-profit case.

 The four BJP MLAs were marshalled out when they entered the well of the House in  . Later in the afternoon, Speaker Ram Niwas Goel upheld Gahlot’s presence and said he can attend the assembly proceedings for six months from the date of disqualification.
 
 As the assembly proceedings began with the arrival of LG Anil Baijal, leader of opposition   and three other BJP MLAs — O P Sharma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Jagdish Pradhan — demanded that only elected members should be allowed in the House. “Why is Gahlot being allowed to sit in the House even after his disqualification?” Gupta asked.
 
 Goel said that the opposition had “unnecessarily” created a controversy over continuation of Gahlot in the cabinet and caused disturbance during the LG’s address. He also charged the BJP MLAs with demeaning the office of LG as well as the House.
 
 “I would like to clarify that as per Section 43 (2) of NCT Act, he (Gahlot) can continue as a minister for six months without being a member of the House. As far as his role is concerned, that too has been provided in Section 11 of the Act which states that he can participate in the proceedings of the assembly and committees,” Goel added.
