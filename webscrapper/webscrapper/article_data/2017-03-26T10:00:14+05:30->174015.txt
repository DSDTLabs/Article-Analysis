LUCKNOW: City’s prominent non-veg outlets — Tunday Kababi, Idrees Biryani, Raheem’s Nahari Kulche and Mubeen’s Pasande — downed their shutters on Saturday afternoon in solidarity with the   of   dealers’ and suppliers’ association to oppose the state government’s recent crackdown on slaughterhouses. 

 Other food joint owners said buffalo meat had anyway been off the shelves since Tuesday when the crackdown on unlicensed slaughterhouses started.
 
  Now goat and chicken suppliers have also gone on strike, leaving them with no option but to close down till the crisis got over.
 
 Other popular joints who have joined in the protest were Mughlai cuisine restaurants like Al-Zaiqa, Mughlai Zaiqa, The Mughals and Alamgir etc. All the restaurants were forced to sell meat dishes made from mutton and chicken. 
 
 Mohammad Usman, owner of Tunday Kababi, Aminabad, said, “We are known for our delicacies prepared with buffalo meat. Due to its unavailability of buff meat and in support of the strike, we shut down our eatery also.” 
 
 “It is sad that we have to witness such a phase. I have decided to shut shop in protest,” said Haji Zubair Ahmad, owner of Raheem’s at Akbari Gate. “We are famous because of our buffalo meat kebabs and our business cannot survive on chicken and mutton. Though chicken and mutton are also not available now so we are forced to shut our shops. I am shutting my shop to support of buffalo meat suppliers,” said Haji Raees Ahmad, owner of Tunday Kababi, Chowk.
