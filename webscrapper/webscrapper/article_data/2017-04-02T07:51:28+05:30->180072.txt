PUNE: The   ( ) has denied extension to SWaCH’s (solid waste collection and handling) pilot scheme for waste collection and segregation in the area, citing the huge investment required for the project.

 Initially, PCB had approved a test run of the drive by SWaCH-trained sanitation workers for which they were given waste collection vehicles and sorting yards from the board. PCB also agreed upon subsidising half of the user fee — Rs 60 for households and Rs 120 for commercial buildings.
 
 However, board officials said that the project is “not feasible”, considering the expenses incurred during the trial run. 
 
 Apart from this, officials have estimated a minimum of Rs15 lakh for procuring the equipment required in the initiative.
 
 “We will have to arrange around Rs88 lakh per year for this plan to work. Of which, we expect to recover only around Rs25 lakh through user fees. Moreover, the agreement had a clause that said if a resident failed to pay the fee, it will be borne by the board. Financially, it doesn’t make sense to run such an expensive programme,” said a senior PCB health official.
 
 The official, however, was quick to add that they had not abandoned the waste segregation plan and were looking at cheaper options.
 
 “We have told NGO Janwani and   to continue the drive in two wards. The board will also provide them equipment, like buckets, push-carts and sorting sheds,” the official added.
