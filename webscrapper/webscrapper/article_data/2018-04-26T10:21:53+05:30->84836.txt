CHANDIGARH:   heath minister Brahm   extended free dengue testing facility to 33 government hospitals across the state on the occasion of World Malaria Day on Wednesday. 

 Chairing a meeting of the state task force on dengue, the health minister said sub-divisional hospitals at Derabassi, Batala, Phagwara, Khanna, Nabha, Malout and   would now have free dengue testing facility. Earlier, free dengue testing was available at only 26 centres. 
 
 Mohindra said supportive treatment would be free in government hospitals up to community health centre level where dengue wards, equipped with mosquito nets, would be established. He added all medical officers and rural medical officers would be trained on the preventive measures required to check spread of dengue. 
 
 The health minister also instructed the rural development and panchayats department to identify ponds so that gambusia fish could be bred in these water bodies in order to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.
 
 In view of the last year's spread of dengue, Mohindra issued strict instructions to the local government department for the procurement of requisite insecticides, spray pumps and fogging machines before the onset of dengue season.
 
 The health minister also instructed the Indian Medical Association, Punjab, to tell doctors and laboratories in the private sector to adhere to the guidelines issued from time to time and share information of each dengue case with the health department. 
 
 Mohindra also made a public appeal to participate in the campaign of preventing dengue by emptying and cleaning all the water containers like dessert coolers, flower pots, refrigerator trays and to cover all the water tanks once a week. "Every Friday, this exercise should be done in each household and every government and private offices to prevent breeding of mosquitoes," he added, stating similar exercise should also be followed by the schools.
