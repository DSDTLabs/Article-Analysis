Chennai: The southern zone of Enforcement Directorate (  has attached properties worth Rs100 crore in cases of money laundering and arrested five people under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the past two months. Officials said more action will follow as they have been given a free hand to dig into the illegal wealth of politicians and businessmen in Tamil Nadu. 

 In the last financial year, the directorate was able to provisionally attach assets worth Rs400 crore in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 The central investigative agency has been in the thick of action, handling cases of mining baron Sekhar Reddy, former finance minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti Chidambaram and, of late, former head of Vendhar movies S Madan in the medical seat scam. All have been high-profile cases involving several crores of rupees.
 
 Even the arrest of a comparatively low-profile Chennai-based businessman, K Liakath Ali, unearthed money laundering of around Rs18 crore. ED’s Chennai zone has been ranked the best for the past two years and officials have recognised for outstanding performance.
 
 A senior official said that large-scale corruption has thrived in the state in a casual way owing to the nexus between police and politicians. “Finding evidence in these cases is not difficult,” the official said. “Only if the local police file a case of cheating or fraud we can investigate if the proceeds of the crime were laundered.”
 
 Prevention of Money Laundering Act is a powerful act, as it is cognizable and non-bailable, the official said. The burden of proof is on the accused as he has to prove that the asset or money is not from proceeds of the crime. Often, the ED is able to register cases by tracking the money trail and legitimacy of income using as elementary a document as Income Tax returns, the official said. In a recent case, the accused disowned the alleged proceeds of a crime, but he has to prove it in court that he did not launder the money.
