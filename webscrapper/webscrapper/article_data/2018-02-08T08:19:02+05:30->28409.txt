MOHALI: If visiting   and clueless about the directions, do not refer to the   signs installed by the municipal corporation, since a few are broken and many hidden behind the overgrown trees due. They are not much help to the commuters.

 During a visit to   in Mohali on Wednesday, TOI found that a road sign was broken from one side and so commuters could not make out what it said. The commuters from outside, who are not familiar with the area, had trouble locating their position.
 
 In Sectors 67 and 68, the condition of road signs is similar. The authorities concerned are not doing anything to get the boards repaired for the convenience of the public. A resident said: “These broken signs sure must be visible to the civic officers as well, so why are they not fixing these. Why do they have to wait for a complaint?”
 
 Mohali municipal commissioner   said the corporation will get the broken sign replace and ensure that the commuters have a clear view of each sign.
