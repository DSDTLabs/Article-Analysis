 may have moved from Delhi to Mumbai as he transformed from a cricketer to a cricket commentator, but the former Indian opening batsman still retains his connect with the capital. He recently visited Delhi and we caught up with him to speak about how Delhi’s aggressive streak escaped him and unlike   (the Delhi boy who scored a T20 300), scoring a triple was quite a task for him.

  Talking about Delhi boy Mohit’s recent T20 hundred, Akash says, "I have scored 300 once in my life (referring to his 301 against Maharashtra in 2010), and it took me 14 hours to get to that mark. So I’m definitely not cut from the same cloth."

  Delhi has always given explosive and destructive batsmen to Indian cricket – from   to  . With his sedate approach, Aakash was always an exception. He says, "The other day, a few friends and I were discussing that the water in Delhi has something in it. Yahan ka paani hi alag hai. It makes you aggressive. But that water didn’t come in my taps. Everybody else was aggressive while I was the antithesis of the typical Delhi batsman."
 
  Aakash says that this aggression, which was once the hallmark of Delhi, has now spread nationwide with the new generation of Indian cricketers. He says, "It’s not limited to Delhi anymore. There is a marked change in the temperament of the average Indian player. When we look at two decades ago, there was a certain amount of inhibition in the players, which stemmed from certain insecurities, because as a nation, we were still developing. The players came from middle-class backgrounds, were slightly insecure, worried, and inhibited. But this new generation is not like that. Whether they are from Ranchi or Delhi or Lucknow, this generation is far more aggressive, and much more in-your-face. Cricket is a reflection of the society we live in, which shows in how our heroes have changed, from   to Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli now."
