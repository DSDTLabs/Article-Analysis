KOLKATA: Trinamool, which has been vocal against demonetisation, on Friday decided to skip the   all-party meet in New Delhi on January 30. Chief minister   has directed all party MPs to attend a meeting at her Kalighat residence instead, and is likely to chart out a road-map for the session from February 1 to February 9.

 Trinamool spokesperson Derek O’Brien said, “Trinamool chairperson Mamata Banerjee will chair a meeting of party MPs at the party office in Kalighat on Monday, January 30 at 12.30pm.” 
 
 Incidentally, the chief minister has already questioned the February 1 date for the Union budget. The day is a state holiday in Bengal due to Saraswati Puja. Banerjee had earlier asked Prime Minister  , “Why don't we celebrate   in a big way instead of presenting Union Budget on February 1? Do Saraswati bandana and not your bandana.”
 
 However, the Apex court has rejected lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma’s plea seeking postponement of the Union Budget to March due to the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Manipur, Goa and Uttarakhand next month. Trinamool has a direct stake in the Punjab elections where it is contesting 20 assembly seats, in at least five of which senior party leaders sniff a “victory plot”.
 
 Speaking at a function on the occasion of Khadya Sathi Dibas at Red Road on Friday, the CM said her government has not cut down on the social and welfare programmes despite revenue earnings falling due to demonetisation. “In the name of cashless transactions, the cash has disappeared. Despite all the hardships due to demonetisation, our humane government is beside the people,” she said. “Due to the note-bandi, our revenue earning has slowed down. But we have not cut any of our programmes. We will work for the people.” 
 
 A day before the Budget, on January 31, President Pranab Mukherjee is scheduled to address both houses of Parliament.
