A month after   joined ' ', her former co-actor  , who was paired opposite her on 'Ek Shringaar — Swabhiman', is joining the daily soap, too. However, this time around, they won’t be playing a couple.

 Sangeita plays Meghna on the show, which was also the name of her character in 'Swabhiman'. Interestingly, Sahil was approached to play Kunal — which, by the way, was the name of his character on his previous show — opposite Meghna, but the deal couldn’t materialise.
 
 He says, “People who have seen me and Sangeita together on 'Swabhiman' would have loved to see us pair up again. I was offered Kunal’s role, but I wasn’t keen on taking it up. Had that happened, we would have reprised our character names. It’s great when you know someone on the set of a new show, as it makes you feel more comfortable.”
 
 Looking back, it was during 'Swabhiman' that rumours of Sangeita and Sahil being in a relationship started doing the rounds. Adding fuel to the fire, the actress’ husband also disappeared for almost four days, following a fight with her. After all attempts to reconcile failed, apparently, the couple has now decided to part ways.
 
 Ask Sahil about the relationship rumour and he replies, “All four of us — Ankitta Sharma, Samridh Bawa, Sangeita and I — gelled well during 'Swabhiman'. In fact, we remain great friends and often hang out together. What could have led to these rumours is our screen chemistry, besides the fact that we would meet outside work. But there is nothing between us. We are just friends and there can’t be anything beyond that.”
 
 On the work front, after playing a positive character on 'Swabhiman', he will turn negative on 'Piyaa Albela'. He says, “I have always wanted to play a negative character, as I feel I can do justice to it. I was waiting for a strong negative character to come my way.”
