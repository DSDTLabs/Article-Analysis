KOLKATA: Braving the Friday evening squall, doctors took to the street and carried out a silent march protesting against repeated assault on the medical fraternity and violence in hospital. Alongside doctors, their family members also joined the candle march. They walked from Calcutta Medical College to the police headquarters at Lalbazar.

 
 “This kind of violence on doctors also disturbs their families. I am pained that doctors are assaulted almost every day,” said  , a Class-X student, whose parents are doctors at a private hospital.
 
 A septuagenarian,  , also took part in the rally. “My son and daughter-in-law work in corporate hospitals. I cannot sit in peace till they come back home. This violence has to stop,” said the senior citizen.
 
 There have been numerous attacks on doctors in the recent past, the latest being the assault on a doctor at a nursing home in Uttarpara. Friday’s rally had doctors from government as well as private hospitals owing allegiance to organizations like   Doctors, West Bengal Doctors’ Forum and Doctors for Patients.
 
 “We want a congenial work environment. The number of doctor assault and hospital vandalism cases is rising. We want the administration to take necessary steps that will ensure our security,” said Dr  , secretary, Association of Health Service Doctors.
 
 The doctors were also upset that CM   did not mention anything on these attacks when she spoke during the West Bengal Health University Sciences convocation on Thursday.
