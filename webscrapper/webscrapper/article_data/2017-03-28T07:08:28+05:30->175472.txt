 Singh advised officials cracking down on illegal slaughterhouses to ensure no inconvenience is caused to the innocent and cited two examples. 
 
 “The licensing norm is that CCTV cameras should be installed in a slaughterhouse but not meeting the condition will not entail closure. The officials should first issue a notice to the owner and inspect the place to check compliance after some days,” he said. 
 
 Closure is a must if the slaughter house is illegal, he said, adding, “But that is only if conditions of environment protection are not met. For example, if butchering is being done in a residential colony and blood of the dead animal is flowing in drains creating a health hazard, the owner should make sure it is checked.”
