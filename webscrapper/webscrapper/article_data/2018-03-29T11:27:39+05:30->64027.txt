NAGPUR: Malhar Raghunath Kendurkar, 23-year-old Nagpur boy pursuing BSc astronomy from College of New Caledonia, Canada, and his colleague have discovered a ‘pulsating’ or variable star and named it GSC 0762-2924.

 GSC stands for Guide Star Catalog or Hubble Space Telescope Guide Catalog. The discovery, published in Information Bulletin on Variable Stars (IBVS), has been recognized world over.
 
 A pulsating star expands from one side and shrinks from another. The star’s magnitude changes due to the varying size. The intensity of it’s luminosity also changes. The star discovered by Kendurkar is a Delta Scuti Star.
 
 Kendurkar told TOI that he and Robert Nelson came across the star during routine ‘data mining’ for their ongoing research on ‘Eclipsing Binary Stars and Variable Stars’. Variable stars change their brightness from time-to-time.
 
 “Robert and I are using a telescope in Benson, Arizona, USA. It’s our private observatory. We also have two other observatories in Prince George — The   and  , which is a private backyard observatory build by Robert,” he said.
 
 He said he that they have made 37 discoveries in last two years. “A lot of time is needed to observe these stars through telescope. We are using a 0.6mf/4 telescope and 0.5mf/6 telescope on Canary Island. This was the first internationally published discovery in IBVS,” he said.
 
 Kendurkar completed his Std XII from Dinanath High School and Junior College and pursued BSc geology at  . “I was always interested in physics and mathematics. Hence, I kept on searching for a suitable opportunity. When this opportunity came up, I grabbed it,” he said.
 
 Malhar’s father is very proud that his son is studying as well as working. “He (Malhar) is the director of Prince George Astronomical Observatory. This is a big achievement at the age of 23,” said Raghunath Kendurkar.
