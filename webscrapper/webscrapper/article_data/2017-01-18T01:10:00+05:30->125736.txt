MUMBAI: Twenty-two year-old   from Bhiwandi has managed to get the second position in the country in the final   (CA) exam held in November last year. Lohia, whose father runs a provisional store, is a B Com graduate from Mulund College of Commerce (MCC). Two of the three toppers this year in the results announced on Tuesday are girls. Close to 37,000 candidates appeared for the test in November, and 11.57% students cleared it, marginally higher than the success rate in the May exam.

 Lohia said he was expecting a good merit rank in the finals, but not the second rank. He also held the all-India ninth rank in the common proficiency test (the entry level test for CA) few years ago. He scored 71.75% in the exam conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). “Though I am not very sure about my next step, I am keen on pursuing my higher studies in finance, I may do an MBA. For the next two years I intend to work in a corporate firm and then move on to analytics,” said Lohia. He originally hails from Rajasthan. While his father runs his own business, his mother is a housewife. He completed his articleship from a firm in Dadar and used the reading room facility recently set up in Bhiwandi by the ICAI.
 
 Lucknow’s Eti Agarwal and Ahmedabad’s Jyoti Maheshwari bagged the first and third ranks respectively in the exam. Overall, 7,192 of the 36,768 candidates who appeared for the test qualified as CA.
