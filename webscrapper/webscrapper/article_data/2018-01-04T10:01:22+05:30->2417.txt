VISAKHAPATNAM: Leaders and cadre of the TDP and YSRC almost came to blows during the   conducted in Gajuwaka here on Wednesday. The showdown took place when local   Palla Chinnathalli, a   and YSRC leader took on local MLA and TDP leader Palla Srinivas, challenging him to submit a white paper on the four   programmes that have taken place during the TDP regime.

 Eyewitnesses said the YSRC leader and some of her associates started shouting at the TDP MLA and using disdainful language when addressing the MLA and the TDP cadre. More importantly sources further added that the YSRCP cadre shouted slogans against the TDP and challenged the credibility of the Janmabhoomi programme, calling it a sham.
 
 One of the sources said the YSRC leader, who is said to be a distant relative of the TDP MLA kept coming at the TDP MLA, whose cadre eventually lost control and tried to push the YSRCP leader and cadre out of the programme. That was when the police came into the picture and separated the warring cadre of the TDP and the YSRC and helped the programme continue. 
 
 Meanwhile, chief minister handrababu Naidu, who chaired the gram sabha at Pulivendula on Wednesday as part of the Janma Bhoomi programme, interrupted Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy’s speech, advising him not to use Janmabhoomi for political gains. 
 
 At one point, some of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders and minister for agriculture Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy tried to stop him, but the MP continued his speech, forcing Naidu to intervene.
 
 The MP, during his speech, said that Gandikota and Chitravati projects were completed by 80 per cent during late YS Rajasekhar Reddy’s time. He said Rajasekhar Reddy was responsible for several irrigation projects, including these two projects, which provide water for Pulivendula area.
