PATNA: Doctors and medical professionals in the state, under the banner of   (IMA), organised a peaceful protest outside the   hall near   here on Monday in support of their various demands, including a strong legislation to curb violence against doctors, amendments in Clinical Establishment Act 2010 of the Centre, pay parity and uniform service conditions across the country.

 The protest was part of the ongoing movement of IMA and its member bodies which have been voicing their disagreements over several Acts and Bills of the government, including the recently proposed National Medical Commission   which will subsume the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The Bill, if approved, will create four autonomous boards for conducting undergraduate and postgraduate education, assessing and rating medical institutions, registering practitioners and enforcing medical ethics.   envisages National Licentiate Examination, which will be made compulsory for all MBBS students for the purpose of getting licence.
 
 IMA   branch president Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said the Bill, if approved, will leave medical students overburdened with examinations. “They are already appearing for NEET and MBBS entrance test apart from writing PG papers. How can you base everything on one single test? What if a big percentage of students fail this test?” Dr Singh asked. 
 
 He said violence against doctors has increased in the state. “The state government should use the Medical Protection Act 2008 of the Centre instead of the Bihar Medical Service Institution and Personal Protection Act 2011. There is also a dearth of doctors and paramedical staff in hospitals across the state,” Dr Singh said.
 
 IMA Bihar branch vice-president Dr Harihar Dixit said the association is against the Clinical Establishment Act 2010 of the Centre. “Bihar Clinical Establishment (Registration and Control) Act 2007 is more doctor-friendly,” he added.
