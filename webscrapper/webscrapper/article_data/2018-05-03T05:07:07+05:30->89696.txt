AHMEDABAD: Two petitioners have moved the   high court on Wednesday, seeking the abolition of the state’s controversial Disturbed Areas Act, on the ground that it violates constitutional rights to property and freedom.

 The Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provision for Protection of Tenants From Eviction From Premises in Disturbed Areas Act was first introduced in 1986, but was revoked later only to be reintroduced in 1991.
 
 This law prevents an adherent of one religion from selling/buying a property to/from an adherent of another religion in areas notified under the Act. The rationale the state government gave was that it would protect people from being forcibly evicted by members of other religions in areas where there was communal tension.
 
 The petitioners, Nishant Varma and Danish Qureshi, contended that this law is against the Constitution and violates citizens’ rights. The contended that the state government had failed to maintain communal harmony in Gujarat, if such a law was required. They held that there may be hurdles to establishing peace, but the government cannot seek refuge in such a law.
 
 The petitioners cited Gujarat’s reports to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has been consistently showing that the state does not witness   at a higher rate than other states. The situation is not alarmingly disturbing in Gujarat.
 
 On the other hand, the state government has been increasing coverage of the law to cover more localities across the state. This raises the issue that if the NCRB reports are true and communal harmony prevails in Gujarat, then there is no need for the Disturbed Areas Act.
 
 The petitioners alleged that the state government has stuck to this law and is adding more areas to it to further its political agenda and not because it is necessary, Qureshi said.
 
 This petition is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.
