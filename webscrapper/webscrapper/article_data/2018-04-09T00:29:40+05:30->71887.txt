NEW DELHI:   remnants is   in Delhi due to its deleterious effect on  . But people often have no option than to burn the piles of  . Since the ban came into effect in July 2016, the three   have   over 4,000 people and collected over Rs 1.6 crore in fines up to February this year. But the violations has seen a big rise this year, with the north corporation issuing 601 challans against last year’s 361, while the south corporation logged 1,181 bookings against 475 last year. In east Delhi too, the civic body issued 709 challans against 2017’s 630.

 The   had imposed a penalty of Rs 5,000 burning waste in the open and prescribed composting to deal with plant detritus. Experts, however, say the civic bodies have done very little to provide enough composting pits across Delhi. The green bench had noted that 29.4% of the total PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) originated in waste burning.
 
 A civic official attributed the rise in violators being caught to increased vigil, especially in the leaf-shedding season. “Though we have been enforcing the leaf burning ban forcefully for three months now, the corporation officials are proactive during the spring season when Delhi sees largescale burning of dry leaves,” says an SDMC official.
 
 The increase in leaf burning, however, establishes the failure of civic bodies in creating a mechanism to handle green waste, argue experts. The municipal corporations, in response, cite measures adopted to make use of dry leaves. “We are training the horticulture staff to compost plant waste for use in municipal parks. Leaves collected from roadsides are being stored to be used as fuel at waste-to-energy power plants in the rainy season since they help increase the calorific value of wet waste,” explains an SDMC official.
