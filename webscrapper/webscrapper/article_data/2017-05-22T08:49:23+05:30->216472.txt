CHENNAI: Small restaurant owners are planning to shut shop to observe a one-day protest on May 30, citing the Goods and Services Tax ( ) rates announced by the   is detrimental to business and customers. They have the support of travel agents, who have started an online petition.

 Around 15,000 small hotels and restaurants affiliated to Tamil Nadu Hotels Association in the city will participate in the protest, said the association’s president M Venkatasubbu. “The move by the Centre will hit not only the hotel industry but also middle-and-lower class people. Small restaurants with annual turnover of less than Rs50 lakh have been bearing the tax by themselves but now the burden of 5% GST will have to be passed on to customers. This will lead to a ten fold increase in prices,” he said during a press conference.
 
 He also said restaurants with annual turnover of more than Rs 50 lakh with existing rate of 2% Value Added Tax (VAT) would have to charge 12% VAT, which would be a six-fold hike. “Ordinary air-conditioned restaurants was charging 2% VAT and service tax of 6%, they will now charge 18% which is more than double the rate,” he added. 
 
 For past year, the association has submitted their recommendations to the Union minister of finance to reconsider GST. It has submitted a representation to the government to grant relief in the interest of the consumers. A petition launched on Change.org says GST rate of 28% for hotels pricing rooms above Rs 5,000 may decrease tourism by 10% and urges the Prime Minister not to kill tourism industry.
