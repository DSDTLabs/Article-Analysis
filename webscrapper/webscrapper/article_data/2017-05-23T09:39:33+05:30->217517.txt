PUNE: People residing in the fringes of the city continue to face problems due to the smoke from the burning of  . 

 While the burning has stopped in some areas, the unsystematic dumping of waste, especially in the non-demarcated spots, continues unabated.
 
 The residents of Wagholi complain that the situation has not improved even after TOI reported it last month. “The dumping and illegal burning of garbage on the open plot next to Wagheshwar lake is unchecked,” a local said.
 
 As the gram panchayat has stopped collecting garbage from unregistered societies in the area, they have found another way to deal with waste. 
 
 “They now pay a private contractor to pick up the garbage, and he dumps in any open area,” he added. The lack of trust in the grampanchayat has resulted in the residents starting an online petition demanding that the area be brought under the   or PCMC limits.
 
 “In the last gram sabha meeting on May 1, the issue was discussed for five minutes. This shows their seriousness. About four km from the grampanchayat area, there is a quarry spread over 25 acres. Waste could be disposed of there. However, a garbage dump would hamper the vested interests of some panchayat committee members, so they are opposed to it,” he added. 
 
 The burning of garbage along the river bank behind   has stopped. The gram panchayat has reached an agreement with four villages that would use the open area for dumping and burning of garbage by offering a waste segregation point,  , a resident of the area, said. However, the amount of garbage has increased after the burning of waste reduced, he added.
 
 Recently, TOI found garbage being burnt in an open plot near the Pashan-Sus Road. “ Dry leaves are burnt every morning in   in Katraj area. The PMC staff and local residents tend to burn the garbage every day,” Gita Patil, a regular morning walker, said.
