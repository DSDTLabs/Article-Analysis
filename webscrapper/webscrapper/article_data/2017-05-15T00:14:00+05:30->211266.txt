 Representatives of Higashimaru Co Ltd have arrived in the city all the way from Kagoshima, Japan, to showcase their larval feeds for prawns. Yasuomi Kihara, who was part of the Japanese team, told TOI that the feeds product for Penaeidae larvae is a result of more than 40 years of research and development by Higashimaru Co Ltd. “Highly regarded in the marine aquaculture industry, the product not only enjoys the highest market share in Japan, but is also widely exported overseas to feed Penaeidae larvae, such as P.monodon and P.vannamei found in southern seas. This larval feeds product is made mainly of carefully selected squid meal and contains a variety of essential nutrients,” Kihara said.
