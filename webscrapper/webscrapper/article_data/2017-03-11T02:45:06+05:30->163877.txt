  The BSF is learnt to have sent its report recently to the government denying any of its helicopters straying into Myanmar airspace. An internal inquiry by the paramilitary force has established that on February 3, an Advanced Light Helicopter, which was making regular sorties from Kumbhirgram station, was flying at a height of around 5,500 metres near the border. But the BSF refutes claims it crossed Indian territory in Mizoram or any other state. "There was no violation of Burmese airspace," said a top BSF official. 
 
 "It was flying close to the border but never entered Myanmar. At that height, sometimes a person on the ground may feel that the plane/helicopter is flying above him. So, that's what may have happened when a Myanmar security officer saw it flying and could not analyze its exact position. We have conveyed all the details," said the officer.
 
  Post Indian Army's surgical strikes inside Myanmar in 2015, such issues have become very sensitive between the two countries. Kumbhirgram air force station is used by BSF to provide air assistance to Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) and   Rifles.
