CHARMINAR: Seeking stern action against the school management which allegedly abetted the suicide of class IX student Mirza Salman Baig, his family on Tuesday sought the State  's intervention.

 The deceased's mother, Shajahan Begum, has petitioned the commission to order a probe into the incident so that no other student falls as a prey to the “cruelty“ of school management. She also sought action against other unrecognized schools that are running in the Hafez Baba Nagar area.
 
 In her petition, the mother alleged that Baig was harassed by   in Hafez Baba Nagar over unpaid school fee. Due to demonetisation, her family was unable to pay two months fees. She alleged that the school principal instructed Baig to stand outside the class room for over a week and sent back home for not paying the fees.
 
 She said that on January 3, the management punished Baig by making him stand in the hallway . She alleged that Baig`s schoolmates beat him up and “removed“ his clothes so that he felt ashamed.
 
 She also wrote that after the incident at the school, the child came back home crying and explained to her the harassment meted out by the management for fees. The very next day, an upset Salman Baig returned home and hanged himself from a fan.
