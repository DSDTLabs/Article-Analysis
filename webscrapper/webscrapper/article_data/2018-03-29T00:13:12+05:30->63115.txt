Pune: The Hadapsar police on Tuesday booked a 45-year-old man for allegedly raping his 15-year-old daughter since October 27. 

 The incident came to light after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint against the suspect with the Hadapsar police. The girl is a standard X student. 
 
 An officer from the Hadapsar police said, “The suspect repeatedly raped his daughter in their house when his wife and son were away. He even passed lewd comments against his daughter whenever the girl tried to resist his moves. He threatened to kill her mother as well as her brother if she told anyone about the incident.”
 
 Fed up with the repeated abuse, the girl told her mother about her ordeal. “As soon as she told her mother about the gruesome acts, she decided to lodge a complaint against her husband under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” the officer said.
 
 A police team visited the girl’s residence to arrest her father. “However, he had fled by then. We are investigating further and expect to arrest the suspect as soon as possible,” the officer said.
