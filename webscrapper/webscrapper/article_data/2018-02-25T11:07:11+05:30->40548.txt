VADODARA: Investigations in the accidental death of Harish Rana, an accountant with Waghodiya-based Parul  , has been taken over by police inspector of Sayajigunj police station.

 The case which was so far being investigated by a police sub-inspector was taken over by H B Vora, police inspector of Sayajigunj police station, on Friday. Meanwhile, the police received the report of the doctors who conducted panel post-mortem on Rana. However, the police have not revealed details about it.
 
 Vora said that they are waiting for the histopathological analysis report and chemical report from the FSL to ascertain the exact reason behind Rana’s death. The doctors had earlier told the police that the primary cause of his death could be cardiac arrest. But since Rana’s body was found from his car outside   under mysterious circumstances, the police had sent his viscera to FSL so that no questions are left unanswered.
 
 The three pen drives, and the notepad in which he had written an eight-page letter making allegations of irregularities at Parul University and his mobile phone were sent by the police for forensic experts for investigations. 
 
 The body was found on February 20 by Rana’s son from the car when he was searching for his father, who had not returned home from work till late. However, investigations had revealed that Rana had left from the university at 10.31 am and had reached Sayajibaug around 11.41 am. The body was found on the same day at 11.55 pm.
