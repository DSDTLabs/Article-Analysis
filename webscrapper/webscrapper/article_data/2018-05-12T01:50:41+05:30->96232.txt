GURUGRAM: Three senior officials of a multinational healthcare company, including a woman, have been booked for sexually harassing a 30-year-old former   when she was working with them. 

 The complainant alleged that she filed a complaint with the company’s internal complaints committee (ICC), but no action was taken and the trio continued to harass her even after she had left the job and joined another company.
 
 In her complaint, the executive, a Delhi resident, said she joined the company in August 2016. After two months of her joining, her   allegedly started harassing her and coercing her into having a physical relationship with him. “My manager started staring at me inappropriately from October. One day, he called me to his cabin and touched me appropriately many times despite me saying no. I filed a complaint with a senior manager, but no action was taken and I was told to drop the matter instead. In January 2017, I was in Mumbai on a work trip when a woman manager who had come with me told me to have a physical relationship with my manager. The senior manager I had complained to also asked me for my hotel room number,” she told police. 
 
 “Fed up with the continual harassment, I filed a complaint with the ICC, but I was relieved from the company in April 2017 without any reason,” she said.
 
 She joined another company in December, but the woman manager spread rumours about her, she alleged. The accused also allegedly threatened her that they wouldn’t let her work anywhere. She approached police on Thursday.
 
 An FIR was registered against the three executives accused under sections 354A ( ) and 354D (stalking) of the IPC at Sadar police station.
