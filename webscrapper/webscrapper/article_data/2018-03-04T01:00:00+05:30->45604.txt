Television shows are all about grabbing eyeballs and generating high ratings. Makers bring in multiple twists and sudden changes in the storyline to surge ahead in the race. Something similar is currently happening on the show ' ', where the makers have decided to introduce a generation leap of 25 years and turn it into a more passionate love story. In what seems to be like an overnight turn of events, the twist in the tale will mark an unforeseen exit of the male lead  .  , who plays the protagonist Devi, will also play her own daughter ( ) post the leap. In addition, the show will see a change in its time slot; it will move to 11 pm from its original 7 pm slot.

 Says a source associated with the show, “The decision has been taken to generate more interest among the audience. A new hero will be introduced opposite Yesha.”
 
 When contacted, Krrip said, “I communicated my decision to quit the show to the producers when they informed me about the leap. I don’t want to play a father to a 25-year-old at this stage, as I don’t look like one. Doing so could also be detrimental to my career. Introducing a time leap, which results in the exit of one of the faces of the show, involves a great deal of risk. So, the makers must have arrived at this decision after much deliberation. I am not upset with this development just because I am not a part of the show anymore.”
