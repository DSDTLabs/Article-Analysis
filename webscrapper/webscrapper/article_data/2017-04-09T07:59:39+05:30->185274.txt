 ATS SP   told TOI that one Ayan   was deported by Saudi authorities and arrested by NIA last week. He was working in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, since 2014. On preliminary questioning, it was ascertained that Salafi’s actual name was Amzad Khan (37), and he is a resident of Ratnagarh in Churu.
 
 “He was on ATS radar for a very long time. Now that he has been arrested we will quiz him about his connection with the banned terror outfit,” Kumar said, adding that Amzad was involved in recruiting people for the IS and allegedly also spoke to other IS members across the world.
 
 While the main probe will be conducted by NIA, Rajasthan ATS would interrogate him for his network in the state.

There have been incidences of these people being inducted into the IS ideology,” a senior ATS official told TOI, adding that a sustained interrogation will be carried out to check if Amzad was in contact with other arrested IS operatives like Jameel Ahmed, who was nabbed from Sikar district last year.
