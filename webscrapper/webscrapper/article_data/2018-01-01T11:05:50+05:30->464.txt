PUNE: Farmers, who gave up land at   for the  , said project-affected people should be given 15% to 20% of the developed land along with monetary compensation. 

 A one-time job offer for one family member is not enough, a six-year study conducted by  's economics department has said.
 
 “Farmers also aspire to receive the benefits of development provided an acceptable compensation is given. This should be pondered upon by governments with emphasis on future appreciation of acquired land,’’ head of the economics department  , who conducted the study with students, said.
 
 
  
 
 Mann farmers over a period of time they felt ‘cheated’ and protested in 2006 which continued .
 
 Team members found that 70% farmers were willing to sell their land if they received ‘acceptable’ compensation and some were keen to develop the land. The study found that the project-affected people would have preferred some part of developed land instead of compensation.
 
 “We received responses from farmers who felt that with industry coming up on their land, the prices of land had increased. As such, they wanted a share of future appreciation. Giving a part of the developed land back as has been proposed in the town planning schemes proposed by PMRDA is one such model,’’ said Sathe, who made around 50-55 trips to Mann village between 2011-16.
 
 At Mann, they found that compensation was used to fund weddings and medical care and for construction of houses. Some families spent it on vehicles while some invested in land nearby 
 
 Sathe intends to reach out to government agencies with the study. “The system should support farmers and help them make the transition with a good policy,’’ she said.
