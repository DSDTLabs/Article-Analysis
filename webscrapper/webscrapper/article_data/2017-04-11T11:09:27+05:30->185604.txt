PUNE: The completion of irrigation projects and plugging leakages in the pipeline, and canals and dam walls will save 6.60 TMC   for the city and Pune district. 

 Completing the Khadakwasla small canal work, accelerating the Bhama Askhed project and finishing the closed pipeline project from Parvati to   will improve water availability, superintending engineer (irrigation)   told TOI.
 
 The present water management in summer has drawn up a tight system where a slight deviation will lead to shortage. 
 
 The irrigation department has said they would save 3.5 TMC water and the Khadakwasla canal work. 
 
 The project, which has been delayed because of sanctions to be obtained by the irrigation department, should be completed by June 30, 2018. 
 
 Bhama Askhed project would give additional 2.60 TMC water to Pune city especially for   and Ahmednagar Road areas. The deadline was set for March 31, next year. The PMC and the rehabilitation department should speed up the rehabilitation package. 
 
 Guardian minister Girish Bapat in Mondayâ€™s meeting said the government would hasten the project. It would hold necessary meetings and disburse the compensation amount at the earliest so that farmers do not stall the project, he added.
 
 The Parvati and Cantonment closed pipeline would save 0.50 TMC water. The project, which has to be implemented by the civic body, is facing hurdles over rehabilitation of slums along the pipeline, and the deadline for its completion is December 31, this year.
