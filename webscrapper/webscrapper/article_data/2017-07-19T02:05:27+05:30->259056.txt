NEW DELHI: In a dramatic move aimed at refurbishing her appeal as a Dalit leader after a humiliating meltdown in the UP assembly polls,   chief   resigned her   membership on Tuesday, protesting at not being allowed to raise recent instances of violence against Scheduled Castes.

 Mayawati announced her decision with a flourish when asked by Rajya Sabha deputy chairman P J Kurien to cut short a speech during zero hour on the alleged targeting of Dalits in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The leader, who had begun by lashing out at   which she said was promoting casteist politics, protested that she had barely started. Mayawati walked out of the   in a huff after announcing her intention to quit Rajya Sabha, claiming that she was not being allowed to speak for Dalits, minorities, farmers, backward classes, labour class and the poor. She handed over her resignation to Rajya Sabha Chairman   in the evening.
 
 The BSP leader’s term is due to end in April next year and as things stand, her prospects for re-election are nonexistent given her party’s 18 seats in the UP assembly. There has been talk of an SP-BSP grand coalition for the 2019   elections, but the formulation has not got to a stage of serious discussion.
 
 “It is not good that I cannot speak in the House on issues close to me... When I got up to speak, the government did not allow me to complete. Their members stood up and interfered. It is not good,” she said after resigning.
 
  staged a walkout in support of Mayawati, even as BSP members were seen shouting anti-government slogans in the well of the House.
