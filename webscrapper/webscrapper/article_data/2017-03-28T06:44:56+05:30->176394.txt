KOCHI: A   is essential in  , allegedly involving chief minister  , as there is evidence regarding conspiracy,   argued before the high court on Monday.

 Challenging a CBI special courtâ€™s November 2013 decision to discharge Vijayan and six others, the central investigation agency submitted that conspiracy occurred at each stage of the deal and all the accused in the case had participated in the conspiracy.
 
 Specific evidence is available regarding the conspiracy but the special court discharged Vijayan and others without properly appreciating the evidence and without verifying facts, CBI contended.
 
 In a hearing held on March 17, senior Supreme Court lawyer Harish Salve had argued on behalf of Vijayan that the investigation agency had adopted a pick-and-choose method to build up a case against Vijayan but has been unable to substantiate its claim that undue gains were made by the accused. If all those involved in the deal were made accused, then chief minister A K Nayanar would have been the first accused in the case, he had argued. Vijayan is the 7th accused in the case.
 
 Lavalin graft case relates to alleged loss of Rs 266.2 crore to the exchequer in awarding three modernization contracts at a higher rate to a Canadian firm named SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. 
 
 According to an early-posting petition filed by the state government while UDF was in power, Vijayan, who was the power minister, was the decision maker of the deal when it was finalized during a Canadian visit in October 1996.
 
 Awarding the contract at a higher rate resulted in a loss of Rs 266.2 crore whereas further losses were suffered in not getting a promised grant of Rs 98.4 crore for Malabar Cancer Centre and in obtaining a foreign loan of Rs 126.76 crore at a high interest rate of 18.6%, the petition had stated. Based on the petition, the court had made the state government a party in the case. Further hearing in the case will continue on Tuesday.
