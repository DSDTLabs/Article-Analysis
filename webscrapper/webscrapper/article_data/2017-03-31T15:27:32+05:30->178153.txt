Irshad 567‏ @567Irshad 18m18 minutes ago MoreJust as the name of the movie implies,   revolves around David Ninan, the dad and his daughter Sarah-   and Baby Anikha. The first half is a glorious celebration of the actor’s charm and persona. 

 The film is 2 hour 31 minutes-long, and the first half rides high on Mammootty’s character’s good looks, as a heroic halo is created by daughter out of sheer adulation and love. Tamil actor Arya gets a good share of action to perform as the stylish cop Andrews. 
 
  
  
 The crux of the film is a much-discussed issue, which is plaguing our society at the moment. While the precursor is all about the indisputable and strong David Ninan, the intermission break hints that the great and adorable father you have seen so far will undergo a sea change in the latter half.
