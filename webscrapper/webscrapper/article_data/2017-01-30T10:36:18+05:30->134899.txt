BENGALURU: After tendering his resignation to the Congress party's primary membership, former Union minister   dismissed rumours that he was retiring from active politics or was joining the race to the post of vice-president. Excerpts from the news conference.

 
 
 
 There are two types of politicians. One who react immediately after being hurt, others are like tube lights which take time to light up. You can consider me a tube light which took four long years to realize it and react.
 
 
 
 
 No. It is not possible.
 
 
 
 
 It was as soon as I was dropped in 2012 as external affairs minister. I still don't know why I was dropped. If I didn't do anything as external affairs minister, so was the case with my successor.Find out what he did. Later, when my tenure in the Rajya Sabha was coming to an end, Sonia and the party did not tell me when I was in New Delhi. Only after I came back to Bengaluru, Sonia called me and informed that I was not being considered for the ticket. They should have held a meeting with me and ex plained the reasons.
 
 
 
 Have I lost my mind? Why would I enter the race to become the vice-president of India? I have no intentions of meeting the PM.
 
 
 
 I never said I am ditching the party, I am quitting the party.
 
 There is a world of difference between the two words.
 
 
 
 
 I don't want to say anything about the state government as I have quit the party. I was one among those responsible for getting Siddaramaiah into the party. They (Siddaramaiah and others) had come to Maharashtra Raj Bhavan when I was the governor. They indicated their inclination to join the Congress. I went to New Delhi and spoke to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, saying taking him into the party will be beneficial.
 
 
 
 
 If I was 20 years younger, I may have thought of reviving the PSP. However, I will seriously consider the option of floating one as well.
