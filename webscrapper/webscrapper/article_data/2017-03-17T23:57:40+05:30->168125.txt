Hyderabad: As India gears up for the rollout of the much awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is most likely to come into effect in July this year, one of the emerging sectors that is expected to rake in the moolah is the e-commerce sector, experts said.

 “Right now without GST, certain markets in several states are not accessible to e-commerce players as they face taxation issues, that also results in costs adding up for the end consumer. Once GST comes, India will become one marketplace and the common man can start doing more e-commerce transactions...,” Prof. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, associate professor of finance at the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, said while speaking at a panel discussion organised by Karvy group as part of the second edition of the Finapolis Knowledge Series in Hyderabad.
 
 Earlier this month, the GST Council had decided to cap the tax collected at source from e-commerce companies at 1%.
 
 He added that due to demonetisation, consumers​ have been moving from cash to the digital economy, which is also going to provide a boost to e-commerce players in the country.
 
 Meanwhile, Telangana principal finance secretary K Ramakrishna Rao pointed out that as the government rolls out GST this year, the aam aadmi may have to bear the bear the burden of high inflation in the near-term. However, in the medium term, i.e. in the next two to five years, prices are expected to moderate, he added. The government official also pointed out that one of the biggest challenges will be to get the IT infrastructure in place for the rollout of GST.
