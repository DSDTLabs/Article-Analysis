CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Saturday told its legal team in no uncertain terms that the arguments in   – when the state’s contempt plea and Centre’s clarification petition comes up for hearing on April 9 – should only pave way for constitution of Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee and nothing less.

 This was conveyed at a high-level meeting convened by chief minister   with legal team appearing for the state in Supreme Court. “In its extensive verdict, the Supreme Court has referred to several times the Cauvery mangement board, recommended by the tribunal to regulate water releases in Karnataka reservoirs. The advocates were told to insist on that aspect,” said an official source. The legal team has also been told to thrash Karnataka’s argument that the ‘Scheme’ contemplated in the SC verdict was only a ‘dispute resolution body,’ especially when the court made it clear that it cannot be an adjudication body but implementing authority.
 
 The one-hour meeting also deliberated on the Centre’s petition seeking time to implement the court order for three months in view of Karnataka polls, especially when the “Election Commission and the state did not express fears on law and order,” sources said. Chief election commissioner Om Prakash Rawat, while announcing the date of polls, said the model code of conduct did not stand in the way of implementing court orders. Deputy chief minister  , ministers D Jayakumar and  , chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan, TN advocate general Vijay Narayan, and legal team-led by senior advocate, Shekhar Naphade and bureaucrats took part.
