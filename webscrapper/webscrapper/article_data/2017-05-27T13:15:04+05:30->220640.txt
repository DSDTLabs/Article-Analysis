Brad Pitt,  , Courtney Love, Pharrell Williams, Lisa Marie Presley and more paid their respects to   at the legendary singer's private funeral here. 

  
  
 The founder of bands like Soundgarden and Audioslave, Cornell, was laid to rest alongside punk   Johnny Ramone in the Garden of Legends at   Forever Cemetery here on Friday. Cornell's former bandmates Kim Thayil,   and Matt Cameron were also spotted at the service. 
 
 Morello, who has played with Audioslave and Rage Against The Machine, told mourners to make a pledge in Cornell's memory. "If you are depressed, if you are in trouble, if you feel like you might slip off the tightrope of life, in that moment you call the person sitting next to you right now, or you can call me," he said. 
 
 "For Chris's sake let's make a commitment to looking after one another." He mentioned a few things he liked about the music icon, including his smile, his "ridiculously beautiful hair" and his "willingness to help others". 
 
 Cornell's widow Vicky was also among the hundreds at the open-air ceremony, where Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Brad Delson performed Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'. 
 
 Following the private ceremony, fans outside the cemetery were allowed to enter the area to say their last goodbye to their favourite artiste, who found dead after he committed suicide by hanging in his hotel's bathroom, an hour after wrapping up his concert in Detroit's Fox Theatre.
