Nagpur: Making   employable is a major challenge for which colleges will have to brace up for improving the quality of education, said Avinash Surve, secretary and executive director, Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC), on Friday.

 Speaking on the ‘Role of engineers in a developing India’ at the 50th Engineer’s Day celebrations organized by Institution of Engineers, Surve called for producing good students who can then share their ideas for bringing about innovative changes in the country.
 
 Surve said that engineers are the ones who have versatile mind and who can build bridges between science, technology and society. Though India’s growth rate has declined in recent times, it is likely to pick up momentum in the near future. Therefore, achievements of engineers should reach the grass roots level so that a common man’s life can be made fruitful, he added.
 
 Earlier, dignitaries paid tributes to M Visvesvaraya. In his address, DP Mase, chairman, IEI, NLC, said that professional engineers should strive to work out a formula to provide affordable houses to the people of the country as it is their basic need. This would thus be a step towards becoming a developed country as 40% of the populace is without a house, he added.
 
 IEL committee member Meera Dhabu highlighted the works of Visvesvaraya. Rajesh Pande, principal, RKNEC, was felicitated by Surve. Hemant Thakare, council member of IEI, Kolkata, delivered the presidential address. 
 
 The programme was conducted by Satish Raipure while Milind Pathak, secretary, IEI, NLC, proposed a vote of thanks.
