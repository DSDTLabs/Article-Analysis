COIMBATORE: A construction worker was sentenced to   on Thursday for hacking to death his wife on October 20, 2014. The convict, identified as  , of   near Sundarapuram, murdered his wife S Sathyapriya, 21, of Rathinapuri, suspecting her fidelity.

 Sathyapriya, police said, got married to Saravanan in 2012 and gave birth to a girl child. Saravanan suspected his wife’s character and used to fight with her often. Unable to bear his mental and physical torture, Sathyapriya moved to her mother’s house at Rathinapuri along with her daughter.
 
 However, her parents pacified the couple. On October 18, 2014, she returned to her husband’s house. Saravanan again suspected his wife’s fidelity. On October 20, 2014, Sathyapriya’s parents and relatives visited her at her house in Pillaiyarpuram. Saravanan came home drunk and picked up a quarrel with his wife.
 
 Sathyapriya’s parents tried to pacify them, but in vain. When Sathyapriya went inside the kitchen, Saravanan followed her and argued with her again. In a fit of rage, he attacked her with a sickle and fled.
 
 Immediately, her parents and relatives informed the Podanur police, who rushed to the spot and sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem. They registered a case against Saravanan under Section 302 ( ) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him in a day and lodged him at the Coimbatore Central Prison. Saravanan, however, came out on bail after a few months.
 
 The case trial was held before the first additional district judge court here. Special public prosecutor V V Nagarajan appeared for the victim’s family and sought maximum punishment for Saravanan. Judge M Christopher found Saravanan guilty under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment on Thursday. The court also imposed on him a fine of Rs5,000.
