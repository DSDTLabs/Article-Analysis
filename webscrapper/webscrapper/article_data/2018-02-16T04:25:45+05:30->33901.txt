TITWALA: The family of automobile engineer  , 21, who committed suicide allegedly due to   claimed to have got yet another   on Wednesday evening.

 The anonymous letter, with the Thane rural police stamp on the envelope, has threatened the family with dire consequences if they do not withdraw the case before the next hearing on February 21. TOI has a copy of the letter and stamped envelope.
 
 Jagtap’s family had moved Bombay high court last month against the policemen. Subsequently, a criminal offence was filed against two policemen and the case handed over to crime branch for probe.
 
 In August 2017, Jagtap was found hanging in his house. His family alleged he had been beaten up by the police who had summoned him the previous day in a bike theft case.
 
 This isn’t the first threat letter sent to the family. Last Saturday, Jagtap’s mother Pushpa returned home to find a similarly worded letter. In both instances, the family approached Titwala police who registered non-cognizable offences.
 
 Talking to TOI, Pushpa said, “The tone of the letters conveys our lives are in danger and the Thane rural police are doing nothing about it.”
 
 The family is worried about the accused cops’ anticipatory bail getting extended on February 21 during the next hearing in Kalyan sessions court. 
 
 The Jagtap family had said earlier it is not happy with the case given to the in-charge of Thane crime branch, Vyankat Andhale, who was earlier the senior inspector at Titwala police station. “He has good relations with the cops involved in harassing Mitesh,” said a family member.
 
 Meanwhile, several attempts to contact Mahesh Patil, superintendent of police, Thane rural, proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages from this reporter.
