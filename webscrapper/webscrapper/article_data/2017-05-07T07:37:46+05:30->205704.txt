KOTTAYAM: The rift between the two factions in the Kerala Congress (M) headed by K M Mani and P J   has widened and the   seems to be heading for another split. 

  The parliamentary party meeting of the party to be held in   on Monday will be crucial following the recent political developments.
 
 There are all indications that K M Mani and his son Jose K Mani are getting isolated in the party. A majority of party MLAs have taken a pro-UDF stand, prominent among them, P J Joseph and Mons Joseph.
 
 On Saturday, P J Joseph agreed there were differences of opinion within the party with regards to the alliance with the CPM in   district panchayat. He also said he did not agree with certain decisions taken by the local leaders of the party. 'I will discuss these issues at Monday's meeting," said Joseph, the working chairman of the party.
 
 Mons Joseph also confirmed that there were some 'issues' within the party and that he will raise them up at the meeting. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Congress leadership continued to attack Mani and Jose K Mani even as they indicated that the UDF doors were open to other members of the party.
 
 P J Joseph and Mons had boycotted the meeting called by Mani at his residence on Friday night. Party deputy chairman C F   attended the meeting only after Mani made repeated requests over the phone. 
 
 Meanwhile,  , who had left Kerala Congress (M) and switched over to the LDF has given clear indications that he will return to the UDF along with the Joseph group, if Mani decides to move to the LDF.
