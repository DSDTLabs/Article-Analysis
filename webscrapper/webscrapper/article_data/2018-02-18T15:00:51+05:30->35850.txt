INDORE: A 28-year-old man swallowed five blades after he was thrashed by some youths in his colony in   area after a scuffle. The man kept saying that he couldn't tolerate the insult and wanted to commit suicide. 

 He was somehow convinced and brought to a hospital where three blades were removed but two are still stuck in his oesophagus, claimed doctors. 
 
 Arpit, 28, son of Vinod Mishra, resident of   under Khajrana police station was thrashed by two persons of his colony Rohit and Amit after a scuffle. The duo t also attacked him with a blade. 
 
 Irked over the incident, Arpit went inside the house and swallowed five blades one after another. His wife somehow stopped him and made him vomit. “We managed to take out three blades but two were still lodged inside his body,” said Sonu, Arpit’s brother. 
 
 His family members rushed him to MY hospital in the afternoon on Friday but he fled the spot. He was again brought back to the hospital where the treatment was started. A psychologist was also called to speak to him who then convinced him to undergo an operation to remove the blades from his body.
 
 During the counselling session, Arpit kept saying that since he was insulted in the colony, he couldn’t face anyone now and wanted to commit suicide. MY doctors claimed that several scratches could also be seen on his hand where he had tried to harm himself earlier. 
 
 His family said that he had tried to do this several times after getting upset over some issue. Meanwhile, police registered a case in the matter and started investigations.
