PANAJI: Goa’s response to any kind of casualties on roads or elsewhere will be much faster. The health ministry is set to introduce 20 motorcycle-borne paramedics to beat traffic blues, health Minister Vishwajit Rane said.

 The unique service is expected to be rolled in June, and motorcycle pilots will be stationed in the coastal belt and in locations identified as accident prone, he said.
 
 “Our motto is to save lives and in the next few months, we will see that 108   service is turned into one of the best emergency services in the country,” said Rane. Also 10 more advanced ambulances will join the fleet in the next few days.
 
 The new emergency service, Rane said, was being launched on the lines of service launched in Karnataka. 
 
 The health minister had a review meeting of the 108 ambulance service on Thursday, which was attended by Dr  , director of health service, and Dr  , dean, Goa Medical College and Hospital.
 
 Rane said it was the first meeting that was held in the past six years, and he would conduct meetings every 15 days to see that emergency service runs smoothly.
 
 He said 80% ambulances from the existing fleet are responding to calls within stipulated time. In case of others, explanation is sought from ambulance pilots for delays in reaching the spot.
 
 In the past one year, there were too many complaints about 108 ambulance service, and a case is also pending with the Goa Human Rights Commission.
