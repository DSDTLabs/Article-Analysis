Chennai: Pallikaranai is the last surviving marshland in the city, despite rapid urbanisation, garbage dumping and other anthropogenic pressures. Many naturalists complain that the marsh is dying slowly, choked by encroachments. However, the intervention of the Madras high court has given a second lease of life to this water body. 

 Following an order from the court, garbage burning on the marshland was stopped, followed by encroachment removal. Finally, a see-through barrier will be put in place to protect the wetland. The forest department is creating this barrier to protect the remaining water spread area. 
 
 Chief conservator of forests and Chennai circle conservator in-charge V Karunapriya said initially a 30m stretch on the Velacherry Main Road was identified for a model see-through barrier. 
 
 Work began a fortnight ago and a 30m stretch is complete now. Officials have inspected the barrier. Soon, the entire marsh will have the barrier for a distance of 1,600m, she said. 
 
 Welcoming the move, Madras Naturalists Society president K V Sudhakar recalled how the marshland was swallowed during widening of the Velacherry Main Road a couple of years ago. The barrier will prevent any further taking over of the marshland, he said.
 
 A conservationist seeking anonymity said any effort by the department to protect the marsh is welcome. 
 
 Save Pallikaranai Marshland Forum member S Kumararaja said the see-through barrier will be of great help in protecting the remaining areas of the marshland. Similarly, the department should put up digital displays on southern and northern portions explaining the need for conserving the marshland, he suggested. 
 
 The department should also restore the watch tower on Thorapakkamâ€“Pallavaram Radial Road, damaged inthe 2015 flood and the subsequent cyclone, the Velachery resident added.
