NEW DELHI: BJP president Amit Shah on Monday lashed out at Congress for deleting its tweet about another bank scam in which Punjab CM  's son-in-law of is one of the accused. 

  CBI has filed a case against top officials of   Ltd in UP, including its deputy GM Gurpal Singh, who is the son-in-law of Amarinder Singh.   and 13 others have been accused of causing a loss of Rs 109 crore to Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC). Congress had initially tweeted: " Taja Ghotala! Modi sarkar ki naak ke niche khuleaam bank loot ka ek aur mamla ujagar (Another bank scam under Modi government nose unearthed)." 
 
 The tweet was allegedly deleted once Gurpal Singh's name figured in the scam. "Why delete this tweet highlighting the loot of Cap Amarinder's son-in-law. Congress has always been at the forefront of highlighting their own robberies such as the NPA mess, bad loans, the free hand they gave to Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi," Shah tweeted. 
 
  Amarinder Singh said Gurpal Singh was a minority shareholder with a mere 12.5% share in the firm and was being unnecessarily dragged into the row. He said the alleged fraud had been the subject matter of proceedings before the debts recovery tribunal in a recovery suit filed by the bank. It was settled between the firm and OBC, and was recorded by DRT Lucknow by way of a consent order dated March 16, 2015, he said. 
 
  "The fact is that Gurpal had actually been litigating against Simbhaoli Sugars, for his rights as director and shareholder, before the National Company Law Tribunal, as he had been kept out of all major decisions and the working of the company, which was reportedly a matter of court record," said Amarinder. "What can be more shameful than this," Shah tweeted.
