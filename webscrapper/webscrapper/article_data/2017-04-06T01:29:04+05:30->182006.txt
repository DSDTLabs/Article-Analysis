MUMBAI: A day after he filed a PIL against the land allotted to Baba Ramdev’s   Ltd in  , Mumbai Congress chief   termed the deal a land scam and demanded it be cancelled. Patanjali Ayurveda was allotted 230 acres in Nagpur’s Mihan zone at Rs 25 lakh/acre when the prevailing rate was Rs 1 crore/acre.

 Referring to TOI’s report on March 8 on the transfer of IAS officer Bijay Kumar after he questioned the basis of the financial calculations of the waiver, Nirupam said, “Despite objections, the allotment went ahead. He was transferred less than a mon-th later. The government had already decided the land rate.”
 
 Nirupam said the governme-nt suffered a Rs 170-crore loss on the 230-acre allotment and stood to lose up to Rs 400 crore when all 600 acres were allotted. He added that as Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation chairm-an, CM Devendra Fadnavis was responsible for clearing the waiver. In February 2016, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said the government would allot 600 acres of land to Patanjali even before tenders had been invited. Nirupam claimed the allotment was pre-decided by the BJP government at the Centre and the state as “Baba Ramdev is close to BJP and had campaigned for them”. He also said forest land had been diverted for a food park in Mihan area. —Priyanka Kakodkar
