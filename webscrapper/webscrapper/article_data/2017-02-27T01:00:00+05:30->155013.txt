In an endeavour to highlight women’s issues in India, Star Plus has decided to take ahead their inspirational concept, 'Nayi Soch'. The channel has come up with a new Women’s Day special communication, created by Ogilvy and directed by  , featuring   in the lead. The film will put the spotlight on one of our biggest social issues today — gender inequality. 
Uday Shankar, Chairman and CEO,  , says, “'We believe that daughters are equally capable of bringing laurels to their families and society. It’s time fathers take up the mantle of being the progressive role models in their lives and let them impact and influence the world with their limitless power. We are really happy that   has joined us in this social cause.”
 The film shows how in a nation of over 10 million shops and establishments, it is hard to find even one that holds the title of ‘... & Daughters’. It is always ‘... & Sons’. Aamir portrays a small-town middle-class father, who is progressive and confident that his daughters will take ahead his legacy. His symbolic act of naming the store 
 ‘... & Daughters’, a global first in thought, will hopefully have a ripple effect on society.
 Aamir says, “I think it is a great initiative by Star Plus. The film is a tribute to all the proud dads and their daughters, who became the beacons of change.” 
 The film ends with the thought-provoking line, “Kaamiyabi na ladka dekhti hai na ladki. Kaamiyabi sirf soch dekhti hai.” (Success does not distinguish between girls and boys. It comes from powerful thoughts). This is what Nayi Soch is all about.
