NEW DELHI: Five years after the Nirbhaya case led to large-scale changes in the way   dealt with crimes against  , the results are finally showing. Police data indicate a decline in crimes under this category despite “proactive and free registration”.

 While 2,064 rape cases were registered in 2016, the number came down to 2,049 in 2017. Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik attributed the decline to proactive initiatives, awareness campaigns and self-defence training campaigns for women.
 
 There was an approximate 17% rise in the number of cases solved this year compared to 2016. At the same time, there was a 30.54% dip in cases related to outraging the modesty of women — from 894 in 2016 to 621 in 2017. Molestation cases also came down to 3,273 from 4035, marking a dip of 18.88%.
 
 In 2016, 86% of rape cases were solved — this went up to 92% in 2017. In 39% of the cases, family members, or family friends, were found to be involved; 19% of the accused were neighbours; and 21% were known to the survivor in some way. In only 3.37% of the cases were strangers involved — the lowest number in the last five years. In 4% of cases, employers or co-workers were responsible.
 
 Police claimed to have made concerted efforts to identify dark spots in the city. They also directed BPOs to ensure the safety of women employees during pickup and drop from and to office. “Systematic and diligent work” by each district wing and emphasis on the arrest of the accused in sexual assault cases was responsible for the higher number of rape cases being solved, police claimed.
 
 Full-fledged beats were allotted to policewomen in areas identified as vulnerable — this helped women approach them with their concerns. Strict action was taken against those drinking in public places: 23,094 people were arrested on this count in 2017. Under Operation Shishtachar, sexual offenders on roads and at bus stops were identified and policewomen stationed in vulnerable areas in civilian dress. Five all-women PCRs were launched.
 
 In an attempt to empower women, 239 self-defence training camps under the Sashakti programme were organised by the Special Police Unit for Women and Children. As many as 50,986 women took part in these programmes in 2017 against 44,041 in 2016. Also, district self-defence teams trained 2.08 lakh women in 2017 against 1.76 lakh a year ago.
