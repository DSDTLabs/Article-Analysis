WASHINGTON: Space travel caused lasting changes to 7% genes of astronaut  , according to a Nasa study which compared his DNA to that of his identical twin brother on Earth. Nasa’s Twins Study brought 10 research teams from around the US together to accomplish one goal — discover what happens to the human body after spending one year in space.

 The reports presented in 2017 included data on what happened to Scott Kelly, physiologically and psychologically, while he was in space, and compared the data to Mark Kelly, as a control subject on Earth. Researchers also presented what happened to Scott after he returned to Earth, again while comparing with Mark.
 
 After returning to Earth, Scott started readapting to Earth’s gravity. Most of the biological changes he experienced in space quickly returned to nearly his preflight status. Some changes returned to baseline within hours or days of landing, while a few persisted after six months.
 
 Scott’s telomeres — end caps of chromosomes that shorten as one ages — actually became significantly longer in space. However, a new finding is that the majority of those telomeres shortened within two days of Scott’s return to Earth. Researchers know 93% of Scott’s genes returned to normal after landing. However, the remaining 7% point to longer term changes in genes related to his immune system, DNA repair, bone formation networks, hypoxia and hypercapnia. There was a pronounced decrease in speed and accuracy for Scott, possibly due to re-exposure and adjustment to Earth’s gravity.
