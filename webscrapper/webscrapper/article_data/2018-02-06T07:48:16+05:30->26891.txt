AHMEDABAD: ACP Reema Munshi’s job has been saved with the   on Monday rejecting the   despite her   for the post in police department.

 In December, a division bench of Gujarat high court reversed a single-judge bench’s order disqualifying Munshi and for her removal from the post due to irregularity by state government’s general administration department (GAD) during the recruitment process eight years ago. Munshi could not meet the chest expansion criteria of 5cm and fell short during her examination in Ahmedabad. Bypassing the process, she along with a few other candidates, who aspire for police service, were referred to another medical board in Jamnagar where they were declared fit.
 
 A candidate for the post of DySP next to Munshi, Neha Parmar, challenged this process in 2011. A single judge held that the process was not proper and ordered Munshi’s removal. However, a division bench quashed the single-judge bench’s order, though it castigated the government for the process undertaken which was alien to the rulebook.
 
 HC’s division bench had noticed about improvement in her chest expansion between two examinations, “This is rather intriguing. Even the recording of the measurements is clouded under heavy suspicion. We have two certificates on record. One containing the details of such measurements; another purportedly a carbon copy of the original, contains no details of chest measurements. The purported copy was maintained by the Medical Board, Jamnagar. The explanation for this discrepancy is also rather bizarre. No definite explanation is offered.”
 
 While saving Munshi’s job, the HC observed about the loss to Parmar. “We are conscious that this moulding of relief may act rather harshly on the petitioner (Parmar) who, if all correct standards had been applied at the relevant time, may have been appointed as DySP in place of the appellant (Munshi).”
