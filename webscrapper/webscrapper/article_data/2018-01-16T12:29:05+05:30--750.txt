PATNA: Cafeterias will soon be developed on the first floor of the Rajendra Nagar Terminal and the   station. Besides, all big and small stations of the Danapur division will have proper toilets in a month or two. This was decided at a high-level review-cum-safety meeting held by   (ECR)   Anup Kumar with Danapur   Ranjan   and other senior officials at the latter’s office on Monday.

 The AGM directed the DRM to install GPS-based real-time punctuality and monitoring analysis devices in the division on priority basis. He took note of the existing illegal railway crossings located on the Patna-Gaya section and asked the DRM to get them removed with the help of the district administration. He also expressed satisfaction at the track maintenance work carried out on the Jhajha and Mughalsarai routes.
 
 “While the speed limit on the Bakhtiarpur-Rajgir section of the division will be increased from 40 km per hour to 100 km per hour, that between Danapur and   will be increased from 30 km per hour to 90 km per hour,” the DRM said and added the railways would introduce a new centralized water-filling system in the passenger train coaches at the Patna Junction.
 
 The officials present in the meeting also suggested giving a fresh look to the main entrance points of the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Pataliputra Junction.
