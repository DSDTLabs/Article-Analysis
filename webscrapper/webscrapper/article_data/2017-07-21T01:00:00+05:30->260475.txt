  Vijay had mauled a man in 2015, and the guards at the zoo told us that even after two years, visitors haven't forgotten the incident. But Renu Singh, the zoo's director, tells us that Vijay is also one of the most popular animals in the zoo. "He’s not just known as the 'killer tiger', he is also one of the most loved animals in the zoo. People come to see him. Today, children came with cards to wish him happy birthday. Animal welfare is paramount and the birthday celebrations at the zoo are being held with that objective." Schoolkids and visitors cut the cake and clicked selfies with his cut-out, while the 'angry young man' Vijay roamed around in his enclosure. The tiger was greeted by loud applause and shouts just metres from his enclosure.With so many visitors around, singing 'Happy Birthday', the tiger seemed to be quite alert. A guard told us, “We have employed more people to manage the crowd today."
 
  
  A Walk For Vijay activity was organised on the occasion of Vijay's birthday
 
 
  Saket Gupta, a 10-year-old, said, "I asked my mom what could I take as a gift, but we couldn’t think of anything. If I give him a card, he might scratch it, if I give flowers he'll crush them, and if I give him a balloon he will burst it. Unlike a dog, what do you gift a tiger?" Students of   also participated in a Walk For Vijay activity before the cake-cutting event.
