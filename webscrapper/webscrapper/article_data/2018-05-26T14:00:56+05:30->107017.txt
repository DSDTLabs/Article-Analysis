As I ignored him and got into an auto, he also followed me and sat beside me in the same vehicle. Shortly, he started to touch me inappropriately.
 
 The torment went on for several minutes during the journey when I lost my patience and slapped him. He also shot back and slapped and kicked me when my friend and some other people on the road came to my assistance. We all got together and dragged the man to the police station.
 
 But even as I was registering the complaint, there were policemen surrounding me who began passing comments, like why was I unnecessarily taking the trouble of lodging a complaint. They also discouraged me, saying I would have to appear before a court on several occasions to record my statement.
 
 One of the sub-inspectors passing by even told me not to lodge a complaint and let the man go as he seemed drunk. “Madam, you can see he is drunk. He must have done it by mistake. Better let him go,” he had told me. But I was resolved to lodge the complaint and did it.
 
 On the basis of the complaint, the man was arrested and was even sent to jail custody the following day. Three weeks have passed now, but people have not stopped blaming me for the incident. I believe as much as we need a change in mindset of these men, there is a clear need of change in the mentality of the people, who blame the woman for the “trouble”.
