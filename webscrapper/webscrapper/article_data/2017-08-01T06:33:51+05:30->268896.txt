AHMEDABAD: Gram flour, which finds a place of pride in grandma's remedies for a radiant skin, can be an effective medium to lift  , a project by a   ( ) team has revealed. What's more, the findings have revealed that the latent prints taken by flour also have fluorescence when exposed to ultra-violet (UV) light, said researchers. 

 Sumit Kumar Choudhary, assistant professor, Department of Forensic Science, RSU, said that they were inspired by a 2011 paper by a team of researchers from Patiala, Punjab, who had exhibited how the prints can be lifted using turmeric powder.
 
 "A team of scientific assistant Parvesh Sharma and Nidhi Patel, a final year student of security management course, experimented with easily available powders at home - talcum, turmeric, henna, multani mitti, maida and gram flour - to ascertain whether the prints can be obtained," he said.
 
 While other powders had no or little success, gram flour threw up a surprise as it gave the clear image of the fingerprint from the hard surface exhibiting necessary features required for match. The team will now write an academic paper on the find and applicability, said officials.
 
 Vikas Sahay, director general of RSU, said that it is RSU's mandate to explore new methods and means of crime investigation.
 
 Sources at   (DFS) said that currently powders, ranging from silver nitrate to superglue fuming, ninhydrin and aluminum dust, are used to lift fingerprints depending upon the scene of crime and surface involved.
 
 These powders work on basic principle that the human skin, when coming in contact with a surface, leaves a mark due to micro pores releasing perspiration. The powder comes in contact with the mark and gives a print.
 
 Experts said that so far none of the alternatives have come close to the professional powders, some of which are imported and expensive, in providing desired results. "Finding a reliable indigenous alternative would be an interesting exercise", a forensic expert said.
