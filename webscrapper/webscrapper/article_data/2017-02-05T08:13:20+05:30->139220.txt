 “The blast left the residents shaken and angry with the police, but they still came out to vote," said Mohan Lal, a resident of the area.
 
 Another local Rajinder Kumar, said, “People downed shutters for two days to mourn the dastardly killings but despite that they chose to exercise their democratic right."
 
 However, it was different for the families of the children who died in the blast as they are still to come to terms with their loss. Rakesh Kumar, whose 13-year-old son Saurav Singla was killed in the blast, said, “Why should we have voted? We have lost everything to the elections. Whenever there are elections, we will relive the tragedy."
 
 Bani Preet Kaur, whose nephew Jap Simran was killed in the blast, said there was no point in going to the polling booth after their grievous loss. Family members of another victim, Ripandeep, too opted out.
