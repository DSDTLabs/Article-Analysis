NASHIK: Sportspersons as well as citizens on Saturday   against the attack on coach Vaijnath Kale by two youths with a sharp weapon, leaving him  

 The protesters selected Goda Park for the protest as Kale was attacked here on Friday morning. 
 
 Sportspersons from all fields, including Olympian  , Nashik District Cycling Association and Nashik Cyclists gathered at the scene of the crime around 7.30am and condemned the attack.
 
 Raut said, “This (attack) was uncalled for. What happened was very bad. After this incident, parents will hesitate to send their children for sports. Security should be provided at the earliest.”
 
 Jaya R, a mother of a teenaged girl, said Goda Park was frequented by families and if such incidents happen here, it is really shameful.
 
 Shilpa Mendadkar, a martial arts expert, said the police should provide security to citizens rather than asking them to remain indoors at night. 
 
 “It is like girls from good families should not be going out of their houses because the police do not want to do their duty. If this can happen in the morning hours, what can one expect late evenings or at night? Crime has increased in Nashik. Police only show their power to decent people while miscreants are move freely,” she said.
 
 Mendadkar said that girls should also become self-reliant and know self-defence. “The suspects who have been arrested should be punished severely to set an example so that such incidents do not occur again.” 
 
 Echoing her views, Kavita Nair, a mother of two, said that the attack on the sports coach has not only shaken the sports fraternity but has also created fear in the minds of parents whose daughters are into sports. 
 
 “If such an incident can happen in broad daylight and that too at a location where people of all ages from good families go for morning walks or jogs, what can we expect otherwise,” asked Nair.
