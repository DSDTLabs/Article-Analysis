From 1999 to 2016, the solid   of Nagpur increased 2.5 times, states a report by the Central Pollution Control Board ( ). In the second capital of the state which is the highest generator of   in the country, the heaps of garbage kept increasing but the rules to manage them remained only on papers.

 Whether related to quality of air,  , maintaining scientific landfill site or treating waste — many major rules are not being implemented at Bhandewadi dumping ground by the concerned agencies.
 
 On May 11, TOI reported on the groundwater contamination in the area. Following complaints of various health problems among residents, TOI took samples from a few borewells and got them tested at an environment ministry-accredited lab. The results revealed that the groundwater, which is being consumed by thousands of residents, is highly unsafe for drinking.
 
 To avoid such contamination of groundwater, the environment ministry had formulated stringent norms. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, which were laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), the municipal solid waste should be dumped only at the sanitary landfill site. 
 
 “Waste for land filling shall be compacted in thin layers using heavy compactors to achieve high density of the waste. Non-permeable lining system at the base and walls of waste disposal area is a must. For sites receiving mixed waste or waste having contamination of hazardous materials, a liner of composite barrier of 1.5mm thick high density polyethylene (HDPE) geo-membrane or geo-synthetic liners will be used,” the rules state.
 
 Such measures can be taken at landfill sites. Bhandewadi’s landfill site ran out of its capacity many years back and since then over 100 crore kilograms of garbage has been illegally dumped at the large portions of land surrounding the landfill site. 
 
 “Landfill sites are specially designed with landfill liners so that leachate from solid waste is restricted and doesn't reach the groundwater. Whereas, at Bhandewadi, the waste is being dumped on any available ground and thus leachate is percolating down and polluting the groundwater,” says Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil.
 
 The rules further state that usage of groundwater in and around landfill sites for any purpose including drinking and irrigation will be considered only after ensuring its quality. Desirable limits for all the parameters have also been mentioned. However in the test reports, some parameters exceeded the desired limit. 
 
 While the rules clearly state that leachate generated from the solid waste will not be released into open environment, a recent visit to Taj Nagar (Bidgaon) revealed that leachate from the dumping site was flowing through the residential area and was hardly a few meters away from a well. 
 
 Other rules relating to bio-medical waste, hazardous waste and e-waste management are also not being implemented at the site. To control air pollution, the rules state that a landfill gas control system including gas collection system should be installed at landfill site to minimize odour and prevent off-site migration of gases. 
 
 “Ambient air quality at the landfill site and at the vicinity shall be regularly monitored,” they say. However according to the residents, no mitigation measures were taken. “Since over five years, we are inhaling toxic air which has a foul odour,” they say. 
 
 Most importantly, the rules stress that only the non-usable, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, non-combustible and non-reactive inert waste should go to the sanitary landfill site. However the garbage dumped at Bhandewadi has all types of waste. 
 
 “If the agencies which were awarded the job of treating waste had done it scientifically, Bhandewadi would have hardly 40% of the present quantity of waste. Segregation of waste should have been implemented long back. As the waste is lying without any treatment, the incidents of fires are increasing leading to huge air pollution and threat to human lives,” added Chatterjee. 
 
 Breaches at Bhandewadi
 
 - Municipal solid waste should be dumped only at the sanitary landfill site
 
 - Only segregated and non-recyclable waste should go to the landfill
 
 - Ambient air quality at the landfill site and at the vicinity should be regularly monitored
 
 - Usage of groundwater in and around landfill sites for any purpose should be considered only after ensuring its quality
 
 - To avoid groundwater contamination, landfill site should have good quality liners
 
 - Provisions for management of leachates including its collection and treatment should be made
