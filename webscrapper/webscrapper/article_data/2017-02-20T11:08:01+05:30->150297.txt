 star couple   and   may have parted ways last year but the actress says that they will always be a family. 

 The 41-year-old star opened up about her highly-publicised split from Pitt, 53, for the first time since filing for divorce in September 2011.
 
  
  
 "I don't want to say very much about that, except to say it was a very difficult time... And we are a family and we will always be a family, and we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it," Jolie told.
 
 The actress was in Cambodia to promote her new film 'First They Killed My Father'. 
 
 It is a project close to Jolie's heart, as the actress adopted her first child, son  , now 15, from a Cambodian orphanage in 2002. 
 
 The mother-of-six further said that she was coping by maintaining a focus on her children, Maddox, Pax, 13,  , 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins   and  , 8. 
 
 "Many, many people find themselves in this situation. My whole, my family... We've all being through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children... And my focus is finding this way through. 
 
 "We are and forever will be a family. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer."
