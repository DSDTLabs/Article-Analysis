NEW DELHI: Union water resources minister   on Monday held a meeting with chief ministers of Maharashtra, Gujarat,   and Madhya Pradesh and discussed with them the issue of inter-linking of rivers concerning their states.

 Gujarat and Maharashtra are expected to sign a formal agreement shortly on the Damanganga-Pinjal inter-linking of river (ILR) project while Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are expected to move forward on the Ken-Betwa ILR project.
 
 “(I) discussed various water resources projects with CMs of different states. The Ken-Betwa project is in final stages of discussion and (I am) confident that it would fructify soon”, tweeted   after the meeting.
 
 
  
  
 
 Damanganga-Pinjal ILR project is planned to ensure drinking water supply to Mumbai till 2060. Besides Damangana-Pinjal, Gujarat and Maharashtra have one more common project - Par-Tapi-Narmada ILR - which are planned to take care of irrigation needs of both the states.
 
 Though the Ken-Betwa ILR project has got all clearances, it couldn’t take off due to Madhya Pradesh’s demand for its extension to certain other areas, incorporating smaller projects, which were originally not part of its first phase.
 
 Gadkari discussed issues behind all these projects with the chief ministers. All these chief ministers - Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh),   (Madhya Pradesh),   (Maharashtra) and Vijay Rupani (Gujarat) - were in the capital to attend the BJP national executive meeting.
