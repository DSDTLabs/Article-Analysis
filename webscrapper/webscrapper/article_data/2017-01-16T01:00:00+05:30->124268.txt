After dealing with traffic violators claiming they have no cash to pay challans, the   is planning to go   and implement an e-challan system from next week. The cops will accept on-the-spot card payments or e-wallet transactions. Police officials told us that it’s a step towards a cashless economy and they have finalised the procedure to issue challans without cash.

 BK Singh, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), told us, "We are planning to make our challan system cashless and will provide card swipe options. It’s a huge task and it involves synchronisation of cards, software design and then linking it to the server. On Sunday, we gave training to the Zonal Officers, and after finishing training, we will be ready to implement  . The option to pay cash will be there, but we will encourage people to go cashless.” Talking about the deadline, he said, “We plan to implement it by next week."
