CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   has directed officials of Haryana Urban Development Authority ( ) to find alternatives for owners of residential and commercial plots who have been asked to pay more because courts hiked compensation for people whose land had been acquired for the plots.

 Khattar said this during a meeting with   officials last week, said BJP media in charge   on Sunday. “Khattar also asked officials to find out reasons behind plot allottees being asked to pay more,” Jain said. 
 
 Jain said   had taken the decision after residents’ bodies approached him continuously over the past three years. “He was quite concerned about the allottees as well as the oustees. Hence, he convened a meeting to discuss this issue. We are hopeful that the urban local bodies department will come up with a good solution,’’ Jain said.
