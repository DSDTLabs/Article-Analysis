KOLKATA : Here’s some good news for swimmers in north and central Kolkata. After remaining shut for eight months, the   in   is set to reopen next month.

 After draining out water from the pool following the death of a swimming instructor in August last year, it was found that there are three illegal platforms under water. The victim of the August accident died after getting stuck in one of these platforms. Following an inspection by officials of the   parks department, it was decided that the platforms will be demolished. But given the time constraint — the pool is likely to be reopened on April 15 — it has been decided that the platforms will be razed after the end of the season.
 “The demolition will take some time. After demolition, we need to fill the pool as the summer swimming session is approaching. Amid such a situation, we may have to postpone the demolition till the next session,” a KMC senior official said.
 
 The KMC parks department, however, will prepare a guideline for four swimming clubs on the College Square premises before the season begins in April. According to the guideline, these clubs will need to employ at least two trainers at each pool. The clubs will be asked to create a barricade in front of the illegally constructed platforms so that no swimmer can get an access to these and get stuck like Kajal Dutta, the trainer whose body was pulled out of the pillars. The clubs will be asked to give an undertaking that they won’t undertake any sort of constructions under water.
 
 “We will deploy our staff from time to time to oversee the activities when the swimming season begins. Now we are concentrating on preparing the swimming pool and put in place necessary safety and security measures for the swimmers, especially for the beginners. No one will be allowed in the pool without a life jacket. Besides trainers, divers will have to be deployed for kids,” a KMC parks department official said.
