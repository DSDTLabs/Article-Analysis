Indore: A three-day-long ‘Til-Chaturthi’ fair started at Khajrana Ganesh temple on Sunday. District collector P Narahari offered prayers to mark the beginning of the fair. He also enquired about preparations done by the temple management committee for it. The management committee is expecting a threefold rise in the number of devotees during the fair and hence, has beefed up security arrangements on the temple premises. “About 1.5 lakh devotees sought blessings of lord Ganesh on first day of the fair,” said Khajrana Ganesh Samiti manager Maharajsingh Kushwaha, adding that the temple usually registers footfall of 20,000 to 30,000 devotees on a normal day and it increases to 40,000 to 50,000 on Wednesday and Sunday. Kushwaha claimed that the rise in number of devotees will not be a matter of concern since proper barricading and tight security will help to maintain peace and law and order.  According to temple authority, as many as 52 CCTV cameras have been installed to keep an eye at every corner of the temple. Also, many more police and private security personnel have been roped in especially at the entry and the exit gates to strengthen security. “The fair has rides and food stalls along with other items of amusement for visitors,” said Kushwaha. Khajrana Ganesh is one of the world famous temples since devotees from across the world come here with a belief that all their wishes will be fulfilled. A lot of development works worth several crore of rupees were done to beautify the temple after district administration took charge of it. Recently, card swipe machines were installed on its premises to encourage cashless donations.
