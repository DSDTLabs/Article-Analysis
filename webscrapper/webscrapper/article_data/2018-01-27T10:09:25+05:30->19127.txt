Tirupur: Angry over the apathy of the local body officials, who failed to take necessary steps to clear   from their villages, a group of Perumanallur residents turned up at the grama sabha meeting conducted on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day on Friday, carrying garbage in carry bags. They offered the garbage as gift to the officials.

 “The civic body did not take proper steps to clear garbage generated in the villages for the last one year. Drinking water is also not supplied properly,” said Mahendran of All India Youth Federation.
 
 After deputy block development officer Ramasamy, who chaired the meeting, assured that he will solve the issue, the group withdrew the protest. TNN
