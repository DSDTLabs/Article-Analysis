 The International format is being introduced first time in the Tamil market and on Vijay TV. The show would see the coming together of 15 celebrities in a posh house with all the amenities but who are completely cut off from technology and the outside world for 100 days.
 
 When asked on choosing BIGG BOSS as his first foray into television, Kamal Haasan said “When Vijay TV approached me to play host, I funnily quipped, who better than me right, all my life have been under a constant watch and have been judged on whatever I have done, public or private. But now roles are reversed as I would stand with the audiences and watch these celebrities in the house survive this ordeal.”
 
 “We are keen to leverage the Uniqueness of the format, the reality appetite of Tamil audiences and a great host like Mr Kamal Haasan not only to drive ratings but to put out cutting edge and innovative content“ Says Krishnan Kutty, GM, Vijay TV.
