NEW DELHI: Upholding the jail term awarded to a man for molesting a woman, a court observed that the rise in such crimes have made   of the city’s population feel   and insecure.

 “The rise in sexual offences against   and young girls are increasing day-by-day on public roads and   in Delhi, creating a feeling of being unsafe and insecure in the minds of 50% of the population,” said additional sessions judge  .
 
 The guilty person, in the court’s perspective, required to be dealt with in a “stern manner” and did not deserve any leniency. “Otherwise, a wrong and negative message will go to the society and the people instead of deterring themselves from indulging in such acts will rather feel encouraged to do such crimes (sic),” the court added.
 
 Sunil Kumar was held guilty by a magistrate court under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC. He was accordingly sentenced to one-year imprisonment. 
 
 Kumar appealed against the punishment on the ground that the alleged incident took place in a crowded place, contrary to what the victim had stated. The accused also pointed out that it was “accidental push” as there were children playing on the street.
 
 The woman, on the other hand, stated that the scene of crime was a lonely spot where no one was present when the incident took place.
 
  counsel   sought leniency for his client, submitting that Kumar had lost his father and was the breadwinner in the family and looks after his mother. 
 
 However, the court held: “I do not find any ambiguity, illegality or infirmity in the sentence awarded to the appellant...being half of the maximum prescribed sentence.”
