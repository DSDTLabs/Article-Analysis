Vijayawada: With all notifications released for Common Entrance Tests (CETs), students in the city are busy in preparation mode. 

 The examinations will be held in the end of April and beginning of May. All tests will be held online this year except Polycet.
 
 The AP State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) has released notifications for all the entrance tests this week, including ECET and ICET. The notification for Eamcet was released on February 26, and the examination for engineering stream will be from April 22 to April 25. Agriculture stream will be on April 25 and April 26. The examination will be computer-based, and the application should be submitted via online mode.
 
 It may be noted that the notifications for other entrance tests were released in the first week of March, including Lawcet. With HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao giving a weekâ€™s time for the release of the rest of the notifications, ECET and ICET notifications were released on March 16.
 
 With all the notifications announced, the students are busy applying and preparing for the exams. Many are even joining coaching centres to get themselves trained. 
 
 According to Shaik Sharif, director at Inspire Academy, many students opt to take about 45 days of crash course for ICET, an entrance examination to get into MBA colleges in AP. 
 
 He said students should have no problem writing the computer-based exams.
 
 Speaking at the review meeting, Srinivasa Rao said the results should be announced soon after the exams are held. Since Polycet is mainly written by class X students to get into polytechnic colleges, the exam will be paper-based instead of an online exam.
