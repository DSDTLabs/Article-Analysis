JODHPUR: He was allured of crores and was even intimidated, yet nothing could dampen his firm commitment towards the minor girl who was sexually assaulted by the self-styled godman Asaram.

 Poonam Chand  , the counsel for the girl’s family remained firm and unaffected, despite the presence of legal stalwart varying from   to Subramanian Swamy
 
 On Thursday, Solanki was an elated man who left the court in his 2004 model Alto car and was seen happily sharing his feelings among a battery of TV journalists.
 
 “I feel even in the struggle for independence many lawyers had contributed. Today when we have to fight the corrupt and criminally inclined self-styled godman we need to show ourselves sound and committed within a legal framework. I am thankful to so many seniors who inculcated the rights values in me while I started practising,” Solanki said while talking to TOI after the judgement.
 
 After Solanki was roped in as a lawyer, he made it a point that as the girl’s family was poor he won’t charge a penny. “We were fighting for truth and not doing this for money. It was a different scenario where the defence had lawyers charged lakhs for each hearing,” he added.
 
 “I got innumerable threats and people even offered me in crores. But, what was pleasing and gratifying was the smile and hope on the faces of the girl and her father,” he said.
 
 Proudly recounting his face off with Ram Jethmalani, he said, “Like any lawyer, I was also excited to see him when he had come to argue the bail application in the   High Court. But I argued without fear and spoke on facts, it was a memorable moment for me .”
 
 “The smile on my 84-year-old father   ji now worth crores,” he summed up.
