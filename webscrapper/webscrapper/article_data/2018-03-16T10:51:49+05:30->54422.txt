 “This month, the cylinders are being sold at Rs 1,266. Consumers needn’t approach the same fair price shop for refilling. They have the flexibility to refill cylinders from any fair price shop or any BP distributor in the country,” he said, adding that around 50% of the cost of LPG will be refunded if a consumer wants to return the cylinder (tax is not refundable).
 
 As it is being sold at commercial rates, there is also no limitation on the number of cylinders a person can buy in a month. “There are a lot of migrants in Goa who don’t have a proper domestic connection. They may be using some other fuel that may not be safe. This model provides an opportunity to use cleaner fuel,” Pawar said. He disclosed that mini cylinders are also being made available at petrol pumps and that plans are afoot to have them stocked at provision stores, too. He was speaking on the sidelines of a World Consumer Rights Day programme organised by the directorate of civil supplies and consumer affairs.
