HYDERABAD: Scores of commuters are waiting for   to beef up train services and other amenities for passengers at Lingampally station, which is one of the three upcoming terminals in the zone. But the station lacks many important amenities, apart from inadequate train services.

 In the past few years, there has been a spurt in the number of commuters at Lingampally, a major railway station in the Western zone of Hyderabad. Despite that, many passengers complain that Lingampally is treated like other suburban railway station under the Secunderabad station. Citizens of Serilingampally, Qutbulapur, Patancheru, Kukatpally and   say they have to travel all the way to Secunderabad to get trains.
 
 Members from the Forum to Improve Lingampally station have brought the problems of passengers to the notice of   officials and are awaiting action.
 
 
  
  
 
 Ramavarapu Niranjan, a daily MMTS commuter and a member of the forum, told TOI, “A foot overbridge has been built at the station but it has doesn’t have an escalator, which makes it difficult for senior citizens and differently-abled passengers. Apart from this, there is no parking facility on the station premises, though the number of passengers has increased over the years.”
 
 Since 2006, 2-3 trains have been added to and from Lingampally. Each train ferries around 1,000 passengers. Likewise the load of passengers from the station to   and Rajahmundry has risen nearly 100 times.
 
 Vinod Kumar Yadav, general manager of SCR, met the forum members during a visit to Lingampally and has reportedly confirmed to them that Goutami, Coconada and Machilipatnam express trains will start from Lingampally station soon.
