LUCKNOW: Finally thereâ€™s relief for   who had been facing traffic jams at   crossing on way to Hazratganj for the past two weeks. As a precautionary measure, heavy transport vehicles, police jeeps and government vehicles will be segregated from the routine traffic and diverted to the left side lane just ahead of the crossing to join Faizabad Road via the embankment road near Kukrail Nullah. 

 The road is about 12 metres wide near Badshahnagar and becomes more spacious on the turn near Kukrail Nullah. Though this turn leads to Faizabad Road, people cannot switch lanes to reach Nishatganj flyover. They would have to drive for about 100 metres to take a U-turn on Faizabad Road and reach the flyover. Traffic police has asked LMRC to deploy more marshals to segregate heavy from light vehicles and guide them to separate lanes.
