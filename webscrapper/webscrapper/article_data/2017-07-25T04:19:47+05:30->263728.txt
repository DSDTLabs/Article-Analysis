NEW DELHI: Union finance minister   described   on Monday as having been completely non-partisan as  , and a guide to the government.

 “He (Mukherjee) once told me that he had the unique privilege of moving before Parliament the Constitution amendment on GST. He wanted to approve the Constitution amendment during his tenure as the President. It gave him great satisfaction when he did so,”   said in a Facebook post on Mukherjee’s last day in office.
 
 Jaitley said ‘Pranabda’ exhibited a unique charm that won him many admirers. “His transformation from a senior minister to the President was exemplary. As President, he was completely non-partisan and conducted himself as an advisor... to his governments,” he added.
 
 The FM maintained that as President, Mukherjee was unquestionably the guardian of the Constitution.
 
 “He realised that in a democracy, there could only be one power centre ie. the elected government and the Prime Minister. He, therefore, actively associated with two different governments during his presidency with equal ease,” he added.
 
 Jaitley recalled the occasions when the outgoing President had wanted to be convinced about certain decisions before according his approval. “I was usually sent to interact with him. He was always well prepared on facts, on constitutional requirements and the need for fairness.
 
 These essentials had to be balanced with the requirement of the... advice of the council of ministers being forwarded to him. This delicate balance he maintained throughout his tenure. He always accepted the advice of the council of ministers,” he said.
 
 “India has seen a few politicians like him who had the capacity to evolve into a statesman irrespective of their political affiliation and the office that they held. He exits from the   with a great stature. He will now assume a greater role of advising and guiding the nation as an amicus curiae which he always was.”
