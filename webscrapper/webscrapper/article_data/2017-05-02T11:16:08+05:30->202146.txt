MUMBAI: When a team keeps getting beaten, controversy is bound to creep in. On Monday evening here at the Wankhede Stadium against the  , the   Bangalore looked like finally ending their losing streak and collecting their third win of the season. MI needed 24 off 13 balls when left-arm seamer   ended up being pulled for six by Hardik Pandya off a short ball, which reduced the pressure on the hosts.

 Later, the 27-year-old from Bikaner revealed that he bowled a back-of-length, quick delivery -which backfired after the previous five balls had all been slow and difficult to score off -because of advice from South African great  . He admitted that his captain   too wasn't pleased with either the length or the pace of the ball. Kohli felt the delivery should have been full and slow.
 
 "I was wondering whether to bowl him (Hardik) the slower one or the fast one. Maybe it was a match-changing point. So, I went to him and asked, 'What should I bowl?' AB said, 'Maybe he is ready for the slower one, so I think you should go with the hard length.' "When someone as great as AB tells you do to something, such a world class-player, if he is giving you a suggestion, it's very hard to go against it. And I thought he is right. And Virat wasn't happy with what I bowled. He thought I did the wrong thing and I should have bowled full and slow," Aniket, who went for 32 off his four overs and dismissed Parthiv Patel off the first ball, said. "I think if we had bowled more slower balls, we could have stopped them from getting to the target."
