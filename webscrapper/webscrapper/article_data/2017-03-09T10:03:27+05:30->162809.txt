NASHIK: Industrialists here expect the state   to be presented on March 18 to outline an industry-friendly  , along with low-cost land to set up projects. 

 State finance minister   will present the budget on March 18 for the 2017-18 financial year. Industries also want a revision in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) norms by making operations mandatory after a specific period. According to the current   rule, acquiring Building Completion Certificates (BCC) from MIDC is compulsory for industrialists after plot allotment. But, most of the industries are yet to start with production even after receiving the BCCs.
 
 M G Kulkarni, president of the north Maharashtra unit of the Laghu Udyog Bharti, said, “The state needs to differentiate between the real industrialists and investors. Investors buy plots in the MIDC’s industrial estates, but do not start operations. After a few years, they sell plots to others. They buy land or plots not to run industries, but as an investment and to make profit.”
 
 Kulkarni said that such practice needs to be stopped and plots should be only given to genuine industrialists. “Some of them construct buildings on the plots and get BCCs from the MIDC. But, they don’t start industrial production. The MIDC only asks for the BCCs and does not take action even after   doesn’t start operations as there is no such norm,” he said.
 
 Harishankar Banerjee, Nashik Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (Nima) president, said, “The existing incentive schemes for the industries are not so lucrative and that is why there weren’t many takers who invested here. The state needs to introduce lucrative incentive schemes to attract more investments here.”
