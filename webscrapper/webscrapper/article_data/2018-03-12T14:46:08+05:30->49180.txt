INDORE:  , one of the highest polluting industry, will have to mandatorily install   and energy recovery based air pollution control systems to combat black smoke and air pollution. 

 Regional   has mandated all rolling mills of the region to install the new technique to minimize pollution levels. The board claims that bag filters will reduce the air pollution by over 80 per cent. 
 
 Steel rolling mills usually produce 700 mg/Nm3 of particulate matter in absence of any air pollution deterrent while the standard one time source emission monitoring average value set by the board is 50mg/Nm3. 
 
 PCB, Indore’s regional officer R K Gupta said, “Rolling mills have been producing very high particulate matter. We have directed them all to install new mechanism as soon as possible.”
 
 Gupta said that rolling mills still use the old water scrubber method but most of the times it remains faulty as it chocks the nozzles and corrode the system.
 
  industrial area houses 34 rolling and re-rolling mills producing about 5 mt per day to 30 mt per day. The cost of installation of bag filter and energy recovery based air pollution control systems is about Rs 12 lakh to Rs 20 lakh depending upon the size of the unit. 
 
 “I have installed the system and have seen a reduction of about 90 per cent in black smoke. At the same time I am also saving about 20 per cent on coal that is use to run the chimneys,” Anil Jain, an owner of a rolling mill said.
 
 The mechanism to recover heat by the installation of the new system will help rolling mills to reduce coal consumption by about 20 per cent to 30 per cent. 
 
 Gupta said, “We hope that all the rolling mills will voluntarily install the system within two months, failing to this will invite strict action by the board.”
