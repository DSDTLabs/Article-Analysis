THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Giving some relief to the state government, two private   - MES (Perinthalmanna) and CSI (Karakonam) - signed an agreement with health minister KK Shylaja to admit students by following last year's fee structure. "If more colleges are willing to accept last year's fee structure, then it would be welcomed by the government," she said. 

 The deal was inked a day before the high court considered the petition filed by a few private managements demanding an increase in fee. These managements had approached the court against the fee fixed by the fee regulatory commission.
 
 With this, 20% of the seats in these colleges will be earmarked for meritorious students who need to pay only Rs 25,000 per annum to study MBBS. The fee for 30% seats will be Rs 2.5 lakh, for 5% seats the fee will be Rs 11 lakh and Rs 15 lakh for NRI seats.
 
 On Monday, SFI opposed the government move to increase the fee for MBBS courses in Kerala. State president Jaick C Thomas said that SFI will not accept the government proposal that put the fee amount at Rs 5.5 lakh fees in self-financing medical colleges. SFI will be forced to launch an agitation against the government, he added.
 
 Meanwhile, president of   Dr Abdul Gafoor and chairman of CSI medical college Dr Bennet Abraham said that both MES and CSI were community-based organizations that gave importance to social commitment. 
 
 "We cannot accept the Rs 5.5-lakh fee for 85% seats as students from poor background won't be able to bear this burden. We have a social commitment to cater to the demands of these poor students. We cannot go by specific interests of individual institutions,'' they added.
 
 Other managements are awaiting the court verdict to sign the agreement with the government. They have urged the entrance commissioner not to allot the students to their colleges till the verdict.
