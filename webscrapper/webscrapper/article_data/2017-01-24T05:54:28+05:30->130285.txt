KOLKATA: The   (Hidco) is taking   to come up with a new financial model to boost renewable energy to develop   as an intelligent city. Hidco has signed an agreement with the   for intelligent cities at the recently concluded   (BGBS). 

 A Canadian delegation that attended the two-day BGBS 2017 has come up with suggestions to have a new model to develop and increase solar power usage in New Town. “The suggestions they have given could help in preparing a viable model in which all financial, operational and technical requirements for developing more and more rooftop solar systems in residential and commercial multi-storey buildings could be fulfilled by specialised companies having expertise in solar power usage,” said a Hidco official.
 
 Besides, officials said it is not possible for each and every consumer to bear the initial capital for installing and maintaining solar rooftop panels. “The model, which has been titled ‘Opex’, suggests consumers would get a discount of about 20% for developing solar power following certain procedures. This model is being followed in many countries,” a Hidco official said, adding that they would get Canadian technological knowhow for coming up with the model.
 
 Already, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority made it mandatory for all commercial and residential high-rises in the township to install solar rooftop systems to meet at least 2% of the buildings electrical load requirement.
