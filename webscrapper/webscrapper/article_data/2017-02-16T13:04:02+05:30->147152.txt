NAGPUR:  , 50, who stabbed 18-year-old   to death on Tuesday, was apparently preparing to kill his wife Roshni (46). He was angry since she had accused him of having an illicit relationship with a neighbour woman, and decided to leave his place along with their two daughters. However, Gondare ended up stabbing Raut after the latter teased him. Senior cops said Raut could have been saved, but delay in getting treatment proved fatal.

  registered an offence of murder against Gondare late on Tuesday night and nabbed him in the wee hours of Wednesday. He will be produce before the court on Thursday.
 
 The incident took place in Chikhli slum at Kalamna in front of the house of accused. Gondare and Raut were residents of the same locality.
 
 “Roshni had fought with her husband Mahesh Gondare, who had some criminal record from 2000, and was currently a sanitary workers at NMC. Roshni had seen Gondare talking to a neighbour woman on February 9. Roshni accused him of having an illicit relationship with the woman. She left the place with their two daughters. Following this, Gondare had even lodged a complaint of domestic feud against her the same day,” said senior PI S Bonde.
 
 On Tuesday, Roshni returned to take her belongings. Meanwhile, Gondare, who was inebriated, reached home. The couple again exchanged heated words over the matter. Later, Gondare was seen roaming in front of his house with a long knife in his hand.
 
 At the time, Raut too was standing outside the house with his friends. Raut passed a comment about Gondare, saying that Gondare would not dare to use the knife. This provoked Gondare, who approached Raut and inflicted a deep gash on Raut’s thigh. He then fled the spot.
 
 A profusely bleeding Raut was rushed to two or three hospitals before being shifted to Mayo Hospital. He finally got treatment over an hour after the stabbing, which led to his death due to loss of blood.
