Rajkot: The new Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) bus depot at Rajkot is expected to become operational by April 2019. The artistic design of the bus depot has been approved and work for the Rs 150-crore terminal has begun in full swing.

 National Building Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC), a government of India enterprise, approved the plan on Monday and is monitoring the structure, design and construction of the new bus stand building on Dhebar road.
 
 GSRTC’s Rajkot divisional manager Dinesh Jethva said, “The new bus depot is being constructed on the lines of Vadodara and Ranip (Ahmedabad) bus depots. But it will be better. People of Rajkot will get more facility in the coming days.”
 
 The new bus depot will have two-floor underground parking. It will be a five-storied building with 22 platforms. It will be centrally air-conditioned and will house restaurants and shopping malls. The bus stand is being built on public-private partnership model in which GSRTC has provided 11,000 sqm area to Omni Project Private Ltd for development on 90-year lease.
 
 The Rajkot bus depot caters to nearly 1.4 lakh passengers with over 1,100 bus trip every day across Saurashtra and different parts of Gujarat.
