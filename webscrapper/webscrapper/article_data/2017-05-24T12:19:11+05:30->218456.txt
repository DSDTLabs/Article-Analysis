PANAJI: The 2017-18 academic year will have two fewer working days for schools, as the directorate of education (DoE) has brought Goa on a par with the rest of India as per the requirements of the Right To Educate (RTE) Act. 

 Goa, which had 236 working days last year, will now have 234. 
 
 Chief minister  , during his previous stint, had hiked the number of working days for schools to ‘discipline’ them. Thus, they were increased to 237 in 2013, dropped to 236 in 2015, and are now standardized at 234.
 
 There is no change in the number of minimum instructional days. “The second term examination should be held only after completion of 200 instructional days,” the DoE circular reads. School instructional hours also remain the same — five-and-a-half. 
 
 However, in 2017-18, the final results will be declared only after April 30, a day later than earlier.
 
 The holiday schedule for Goa’s schools was revised in 2013 after the state was repeatedly pulled up by the Union human resource development ministry for not being able to complete the mandatory number of working days and instructional days prescribed for schools. In Goa, schools enjoy an additional vacation of seven days during Ganesh Chaturthi, as compared to other states.
