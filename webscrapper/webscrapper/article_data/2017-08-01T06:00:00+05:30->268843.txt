Visakhapatnam: District collector Pravin Kumar has directed mining officials and cops at a meeting on Monday to penalise transporters and contractors if they are found to over-charge customers or illegally transport sand. 

 The collector observed that he has received several complaints from the public saying that contractors were charging almost Rs 20,000 for a lorry load of sand.
 
 During a meet involving revenue, police and district mining officials, the collector clearly stated that only sand from Srikakulam and East Godavari districts should be used for construction activity in the city. He further stated that contractors should charge only for transportation, ramp, and labour (digging, loading and unloading). He added that GO No. 104 must be strictly followed.
 
 Regarding transportation of sand from East Godavari district, the collector observed that transportation was smooth and easy, but he urged his subordinates to know why transportation from Srikakulam district was posing problems. 
 
 The collector also directed the mining department to put an end to illegal supply of sand to certain industries and factories in the district. He pointed out that the illegal transportation was chiefly from Chodavaram and S Rayavaram mandals. 
 
 The collector pointed out that as many of the sand reaches in the district had depleted, supply had to be restricted only for certain department usages and not for industrial or general use. He warned that strict action must be taken against such offenders.
 
 Urging the mining officials to take help of the police department to crack down on illegal mining and transportation of sand in the district, the collector gave them a deadline of less than a month to clear the mess and seize the vehicles of all offenders.
