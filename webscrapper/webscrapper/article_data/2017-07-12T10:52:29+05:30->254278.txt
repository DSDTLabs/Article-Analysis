Once actor Dileep's involvement in the actress assault case was brought to light by the Kerala police, many of his colleagues have been expressing their shock and anger towards him for tainting the whole industry.

 Actor-writer Joy Mathew, who has worked with Dileep in three films, the most recent being 'King Liar' directed by Siddique, said on his social media post that he is ashamed of having worked with Dileep in a few movies. "Medias who make actors star and fans who treat them like larger-than-life characters should, at least now, stop their 'paalabhishekam' and 'pushparchana' on flex boards and focus on ground realities," he said on his post.
 
 The actor also says that though the accused is behind bars, there will be lawyers brought out even from coffins to set them free. "We can see it in the history of advocates who take up such cases. Who doesn't know that it is the stink of money and not the aroma of humanity that makes them wear their tainted robes?" he says on the page.
 
 A variety of comments followed, some of which accused the jailed actor and others, the writer. "The public always doubted him, we are just waiting to see what his supporters have to say now," said one of the comments. "Conspiracy is not something that is easy to prove in court. The history of our law and order system has proven that the big names will squeeze themselves out of such accusations in court," said another.
