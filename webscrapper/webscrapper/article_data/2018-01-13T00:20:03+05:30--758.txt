MUMBAI: After dismissing four engineers last week for giving the city  , the   is likely to remove five more engineers once the second phase of the   probe is released later this month, sources say.

 TOI has learnt that roles of nearly 190 engineers are being looked into in the second phase of the road scam inquiry—it covered 200 roads where work was carried out at a cost of around Rs 1,700 crore. Nearly 90 of these 190 engineers were also named in the first phase of the road scam. 
 
 The first phase inquiry report, which was submitted to Mayor   last week, had ordered the dismissal of four engineers for their involvement in contractors doing shoddy work on 34 roads, repaired at a cost of Rs 352.16 crore.
 
 
  
 Sources said BMC chief   has sought the report of the second phase inquiry by the end of the month. When TOI contacted him to understand what action would be taken against engineers named in both reports, he said, “Punishments to engineers are being awarded based on their involvement in it. Therefore if we find that an engineer’s involvement in the second phase is higher as compared to the first then the amount of punishment would be increased.”
 
 Opposition party leader in BMC Ravi   has demanded that errant engineers should face police action. Already, two chief engineers had been arrested in the past in the scam. “The other engineers should also face police action,” said Raja.
