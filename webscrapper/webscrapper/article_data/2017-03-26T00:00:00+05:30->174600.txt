 isn’t rocket science. What makes it a complex process are the many hearsays. Here’s what might be making it difficult for you to lose that fat, even after exercising.

 
 
 Once and for all, cardio is NOT necessary for fat loss. Weight training coupled with high intensity interval training is the holy grail for fat loss. Hours of running will only elevate your stress hormone levels, make your body hoard energy in the form of fat, give you aching knees.
 
 
  
 Fad ‘detox’ diets cause more harm than good. 
 
 
 . 
 Cheat meals replenish the glycogen stores in your body and keep the cravings away. If you are above 20% fat loss and follow a routine, stay away from cheat meals for 90 days.
 
 
 . 
  Fat burners, if not taken under proper guidance and at the right time, can dehydrate you. 
 
 
 . 
 Completely eliminating carbohydrates will make you feel weak. Always cut out the carbohydrates gradually, not suddenly.
