Mamta might be spending most of her time in Los Angeles but that doesn’t stop her from bagging meaty roles in Malayalam. 

 After being recently roped in for Prithviraj’s  , the actress will now be playing the lead in the next project of Munnariyippu director Venu. 
  will be the male lead in the film, which will start shoot by August – September. The film is untitled as of now, and will mark the first coming together of Mamta and Fahadh. 
 
  Mamta says, “I have always loved Venu sir’s work, and Munnariyippu especially has been one of my favourite films. The upcoming film will be a raw suspense thriller.”
 
 Revealing more about the film, she says, “You can call it a forest adventure. It will be a realistic movie, something I have never done before. Everything about it will be raw and we will be using sync sound.”
 The movie will thus be a direct contrast to her Detroit Crossing, which will be set entirely in the US.
