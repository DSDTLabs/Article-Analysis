Puducherry: K M Saravanan, a postman hailing from Puducherry, delivers with perfection — be it post or art. After pedalling through the Union territory’s streets serving people, Saravanan gets back home to embrace his long time passion- painting. Known for his way with the canvas, he has earned a place at the first international kala mela hosted by   at New Delhi.

 Saravanan is exhibiting 13 of his acrylic paintings featuring the different facial expressions of people at the event being organised in collaboration with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, from February 4 to 18. The paintings are priced between Rs 25,000 and Rs 40,000.
 
 Saravanan will be one of more than 800 artists and art galleries, from across the country and abroad, exhibiting their works at the 325 stalls in the mela. The foreign entries are from countries including China, Venezuela, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka, Poland, Tunisia, Mexico, Bangladesh, Trinidad, Tobago, Fiji, France, Papua New Guinea, Czech Republic, the UK, Spain and Brazil among others.
 
 The exhibition was inaugurated by Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu in the presence of Union culture minister Mahesh Sharma and Lalit Kala Akademi administrator C S Krishna Setty.
 
 Lalit Kala Akademi in 2008 recognised Saravanan’s skills and contributions in the field of painting and sculptures, and prominently listed him in its artists’ directory. 
 
 The Puducherry government honoured him with the Kalaimamani Award in 2008. Earlier, he had bagged the Union tourism and culture ministry’s Junior Fellowship Award (2001-2002).
