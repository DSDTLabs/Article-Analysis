KOCHI: Justice  , who retired as the   of the   on Tuesday, exhorted judges not to give in to emotions while deciding cases.

 
 Speaking at the full court reference held in view of his retirement, Justice Dominic said, “I can only serve a caveat on my colleagues, even righteous indignation and holy horror are impertinent intruders in an affair of justice. Emotional justice has no standing in the fora of right reason.... The dignity and stability of government in all its branches, the morals of the people, and every blessing of society, depend so much upon an upright and skilful dispensation of justice.”
 
 “I know sometimes people cannot control their emotions. They persist with their notions as if they were the facts… Their defence is that they follow their conscience. My sympathies are with them for, to err is human. And as is often said, ‘With great ignorance comes great confidence’,” he further said. Citing Justice Antonin Scalia of the  , he said it is more important to form one’s conscience correctly before following it.
 
 Judges should also not try to set policy but should instead leave it to the legislature, he said. “Like every well-meaning, rule-bound judge, I too have realized my limitations. For a judge’s strength lies in knowing his weaknesses. I understood I’m not a politician; I understood that the judiciary is a passive branch of the state; and I understood that my decisions should reflect the law. They never should seek to set policy,” he added.
