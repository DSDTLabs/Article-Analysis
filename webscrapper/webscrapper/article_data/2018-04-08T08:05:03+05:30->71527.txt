LUCKNOW: Almost 70% of the city’s residents faced a tough day on Saturday, the morning after aggressive winds snapped   and transformers.

 The immediate effect of the power cut was on water supply which remained disrupted in the first half in most colonies.
 
 
 Commuters faced hardships as a large number of trees had been uprooted and billboards had fallen on roads.
 
 In terms of water supply, Old City was worst hit.   waterworks were shut for four hours due to a power cut between 2am and 6am.
 
 Sushil Kumar of Aishbagh said, “There was constant power tripping in the morning which led to poor water supply. We had to postpone our household chores till the evening supply.”
 
 Many also complained about LMC’s laxity to clean drains, leading to overflowing in areas like Gomtinagar, Triveninagar, Aliganj and Khurramnagar.
 
 Ambika Agrawal of Triveninagar said, “It was difficult to step out in the morning. There was so much sludge around my house because of choking of drains.”
 
 Those driving had to take a lot of precaution as many trees were uprooted near Lohia Path,  ,   and Lalbagh, among other localities. Several people reported damage to DTH equipment and lost cable connections.
