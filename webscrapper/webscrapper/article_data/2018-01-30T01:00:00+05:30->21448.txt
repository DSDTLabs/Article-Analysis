GAYA: Following the Patna high court order of January 12, 2018, land hunt to relocate the offices housed in unauthorised buildings constructed on   has begun in the right earnest. Now that the high court has explicitly restrained the state government from retrospective regularisation of unauthorised structures, district officials are left with no option but to demolish the illegal structures and shift the offices.

 In their January 12 order Justice AK   and Justice Nilu Agrawal said, "No post facto approval will be given by any authority to any constructed building or offices located in   of Gaya. The district magistrate has to identify such offices and find alternative locations. The Gandhi Maidan will have to be cleared of all constructions and encroachments to be made available for the people of Gaya".
 
 As per the order, the DM “must file another affidavit within four weeks as to how he is going to get rid of the constructions on Gandhi Maidan to make it free. The matter will be listed after four weeks”.
 
 Sources say that several plots of government land have been shortlisted for relocation of the Red Cross Bhawan, Indian Olympic Association ( ) building,   (SAI) complex and other constructions made in an illegal manner without the prior approval of the revenue department or Gaya Municipal Corporation.
