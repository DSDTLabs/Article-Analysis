Gurgaon: A contractor of government hospital in the city has been charging the contractual employees for uniforms, though it has to be provided free of cost. The matter was uncovered on Wednesday when the department was making an inquiry into another complaint. Earlier this week, a few contractual employees in the General Hospital in Civil Lines alleged the contractor was seeking a bribe of Rs 6,000 from each of them. The bribe was sought in exchange of posting at the government hospitals in Gurgaon. The workers said those who didn’t pay the bribe were replaced by the contractor. The matter was tweeted to chief minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar after which he ordered a probe in the matter. There are three contractors who are providing the non-medical manpower to the health department in Gurgaon. There are around 150 contractual workers who are posted as data entry operators, sweepers, guards, liftmen etc. and are paid Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000 per month. The one-year contract is renewed in April. Following the complaints, an inquiry began by the district administration and chief medical officer Dr B K Rajora but the contractor denied taking any bribe and even submitted signatures of 106 contractual employees in support of his argument. However, during the investigation, it was revealed that the contractor also charged these workers Rs 1,350 for the uniform, though it has to be provided free of cost, along with shoes and identity card and the same is mentioned in the memorandum of understanding between the health department and the contractor. “The inquiry committee summoned the contractor and he denied asking for any bribe. The inquiry is still on and more workers are being questioned by the committee. However, he did accept taking money for the uniform, and has agreed to refund it to the workers,” said Dr Sanjay Narula, senior medical officer, Gurgaon.
