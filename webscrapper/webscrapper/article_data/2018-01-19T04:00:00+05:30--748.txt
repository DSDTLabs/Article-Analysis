Surat: More than 5 lakh people would benefit daily from the new rail over bridge (ROB) dedicated to the people of the city on Wednesday. The 1,207 metre-long four-lane bridge, which joins Bhedwad with Dindoli, has been built at a cost of Rs 82.57 crore.  This bridge, which has a capacity of carrying about 5,000 passenger car units (PCU) in an hour, is expected to ease traffic congestion in this area because the PCU witnessed during peak hours here has been around 4,000. “With this ROB thrown open for vehicular traffic, daily jams witnessed in the area would come to an end. This bridge crisscrosses the main Mumbai-Surat and Surat Bhusaval line,” an officer said. He also said that it also happens to be the first bridge in Gujarat stretch of Mumbai-Delhi dedicated freight corridor.  The work for the bridge started in 2013 and was expected to be completed within 36 months. However, railway ministry’s late approval of the design and financial problems of the contractor delayed the project’s completion.  “The project got delayed due to multiple factors. However, we are happy that the bridge has been dedicated to the people now,” city engineer, Surat Municipal Corporation, Bharat Dalal said.  Udhna zone’s population in 2011 was pegged at 6.93 lakh and that of Limbayat at 7.45 lakh. However, the population of both these zones shot up by 30 per cent in six years as maximum number of labourers migrating to the city chose to live here. For majority of this population, the new bridge would become a nerve centre in transit of men and material soon.
