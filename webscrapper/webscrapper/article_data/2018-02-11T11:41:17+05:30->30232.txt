MADURAI: About 90% of the shops in the fire-ravaged Veera Vasantharayar mandapam of the Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, which were ordered to be evicted, have been removed from there and shopkeepers say that they are keeping their fingers crossed hoping for a proper alternative.

 A huge fire, which allegedly started from one of the shops inside the temple, ravaged the 400-year-old mandapam and destroyed it.   footage available with the city police have revealed the presence of two men looking at a small fire in the damaged mandapam, before the coverage is disrupted. It is alleged that camphor used by a shopkeeper resulted in the fire.
 
 As the blame game began after the incident, many demanded that the shops be evicted. On February 8, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court ordered that the shops be removed from the damaged area and notice was issued to the shops to vacate the temple premises by Saturday.
 
 Amidst tension, the eviction began on Friday and continued on Saturday, with just four shops still remaining inside the premises. Shopkeepers who did not want to be named said complied with the court ruling and left the premises as they too were concerned about the temple.
 
 But, with temple authorities yet to suggest an alternative for setting up their shops, they said they will plan their next course of action only after a place is suggested. “The temple authorities have told us that they will inform us on February 21 about the alternate place for setting up shops. We will wait till then,” they said.
 
 Also, though the court order specified that the shops in the Vasantharayar mandapam should be first evicted, the plight of 100 more shops in another part of the temple also remains unclear. “We have not been able to open our shops after the fire and have incurred losses worth lakhs of rupees. Our livelihood has been badly affected,” a shop owner said.
