Karnataka's growth rate is expected to slow this fiscal, hurt by sluggishness in the industry, services sector and lower foodgrain production due to prolonged drought in many parts of the state. 

 The state's gross domestic product (GSDP) is expected to grow by 6.9% to Rs 8.71 lakh crore for 2016-17, down from 7.3% in the previous fiscal, according to the Economic Survey that was released on Wednesday. The growth is lower than the 7.1% that India as a whole is expected to record.
 
 Foodgrain production is expected to reach 91.54 lakh tonnes, down from 96.44 lakh tonnes, as 139 taluks during kharif and 160 during rabi season suffered from drought. In spite of that, the agricultural sector is expected to grow by 1.5% compared to a decline of 8.7% in the previous year. The government anticipates an increase in growth in production of tur, fruits and vegetables.
 
  The industrial sector, comprising mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and electricity and others, is expected to grow by 2.2% compared to 4.9% last year, while the services sector, a key driver of the state's growth and accounting for almost 65% of the state GDP, may grow by 8.5%, against 10.4% last year. The IT sector accounts for a large chunk of the services sector; the sector also includes real estate. 
 
 The survey said the state's revenue increased by 11.06% to Rs 1.30 lakh crore from Rs 1.17 lakh crore a year ago due to a rise in tax revenue. The revenue rose about 14%. The report expressed concern about the ratio of non-tax revenue to receipts, which has been declining over the years due to low recovery of costs.
 
 The state has one of the lowest non-tax revenues to GSDP ratios in the country. It is around the 1% mark for the last five to six years ... Even with revision of rates and better collection mechanisms, the increase in revenue from this avenue may not be large due to the existing low base," the report said.
