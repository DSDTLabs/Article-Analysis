Farmers, often at the receiving end of unpredictable weather, will now get detailed information about climatic conditions, allowing them better crop management and damage prevention.

 The   government has commissioned 2,060 automatic weather stations (AWS) in as many revenue circles to provide real-time weather-related information to farmers.
 
  The AWS are providing real-time weather information every 10 minutes, which is being collected at the   in Pune. Specific information will be taken out from this central data pool and forwarded to the area concerned. “The idea was to create a decentralised system that would provide accurate weather-related information right up to the village level,” chief minister   said.
 
  The problem with current weather systems, which provide consolidated information for a region as a whole, is that they cannot predict climatic changes at the local level, the CM said. 
 
 For instance, at times there is rain in one village and the adjoining village is dry. But through the AWS, one can get exact information on these two different villages, based on which, farmers there will know if there will be rain or hailstorm or any severe weather event in their specific area.
 
  They will then be able to take adequate precautionary measures.   agriculture minister   said the government is already running an 'M-Kisan' advisory system wherein around 50 lakh farmers, whose mobile numbers are registered, get general weather information. But apart from 50 lakh registered cultivators, others don’t have access to this system.
 
  The state has over 1.17 crore farmers. “So, we have a proposal from   to install digital LED screens in panchayat offices, from where farmers can get information,”   said.
