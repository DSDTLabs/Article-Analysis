NEW DELHI: India is unlikely to participate in any meeting in   with Pakistan on the   (IWT) in April, as has been announced by the Pakistan government after a meeting of the   in Islamabad on Tuesday. Sources also said India had not, as Pakistan claimed, agreed to halt the   in J&K.

 The Pakistan water and power minister Khwaja Asif apparently jumped the gun when he announced at a press conference during the IWT meeting that the two countries would hold a “three-day ‘way forward’” meeting on the Ratle and   in April in Washington. According to Pakistan media reports, this proposed meeting would be mediated by the World Bank vice-president.
 
 Indian sources said there was little possibility of a mediated meeting in the current context between India and Pakistan at this point. India is yet to receive any formal communication from the World Bank on any such meeting, said sources. As far as India is concerned, any disputes or differences would have to be discussed by the Indus Commission, not by a mediated meeting.
 
 The Pakistan minister was quoted saying, “I am happy to reveal that talks on the Indus Waters Treaty have been resumed with the efforts of Government of Pakistan. Former US Secretary of State, John Kerry and the World Bank president played a pivotal role in bringing the two parties to the table.”
 
 Indian sources also denied a Pakistan media report claiming India had agreed to halt the progress on the Miyar hydroelectricity project's design after objections by Pakistan. “It is factually incorrect”, sources said. Pakistan has raised objections over the designs of three projects, including Miyar hydroelectricity project, located in Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul Spiti district.
 
 Last year the World Bank started two parallel processes – appointing a neutral expert as asked by India as well as a court of arbitration as asked by Pakistan. India had slammed the move, calling it “legally untenable.” The World Bank had to abandon the twin track.
