CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has asked the Haryana government to explain what action has been taken against the private unaided schools, which are running in the state without any recognition from the state government.

 Division bench comprising Justice A K Mittal and Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal has passed these orders while hearing a petition filed in public interest by Bhiwani-based NGO Swasthya Siksha Sahyog Sangathan.
 
 Petitioner has argued that as per the provisions of the   Education Act, 1995, and Haryana School Education Rules, 2003, recognition of a school was mandatory and without recognition by the state under the provisions of the Act and the Rules, no school could operate in the state of Haryana.
 
 A list of around 53 schools was provided by the petitioner alleging that they were not recognized and notices have been issued to all of them from April 12, 2017, to May 30, 2017, but no final action had been taken so far by the state education department.
 
 Submitting that these schools were still operating flouting all norms, the petitioner organization has sought directions to take action against all of them. Directions have also been sought to register an FIR against the concerned officials of private unaided schools for deliberately and willingly furnishing false information, suppressing information and cheating public officials and public at large.
 
 Seeking directions to identify the unrecognized schools in the entire state, petitioner has also prayed that the directions should be issued to the state government to make arrangements for shifting the students studying in unrecognized schools to nearby recognized schools and to recover the fee from the concerned unrecognized schools and refund to the students.
 
 Hearing the petition, the HC has asked the Haryana government to file a reply on the issue by February 26.
