AJMER: State excise department on Monday registered a case against three licenced   for charging extra rates from customers. After receiving a complaint, officials visited these shops posing as customers and found out that the allegations are true. 

 In Rajasthan, one can get a bill for purchasing a safety pin but there is no provision to get a bill if you purchase liquor from licensed wine shops. Officials said that there is no provision for getting a bill from these shops even if the customer demands. The excise department gives license in different wards to sell liquor, which is supplied at fixed rates. "We provide them the rate list for every brand," added an official.
 
 But most liquor shops do not exhibit these lists on counter so that customers won't know the rates of different brands. The department got complaints against three liquor shops situated at Parbatpura, Shalimar Colony and Kundan Nagar for charging more. "We had received a complaint against these shops and decided to investigate," said NL Rathi, district excise officer.
 
 A team went to these shops and asked for a beer for which they were charged rupees 110 instead of rupees 97. Officials then registered a criminal case against the licensee of these shops, "As per the norms if licensees charge more than the prescribed rates, it is a criminal act," an official said. tnn
