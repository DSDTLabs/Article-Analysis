Who says you need to wear only white or pastel shades in hot weather? If you style it right,   can be a girl’s best friend this season. Here are ways to rock these shades in your wardrobe and still look cool. 

 
 
 Of course, a   is the key point of your summer wardrobe and this time go for a black monochrome number. In bandeau, halter neck or classic v styles, the black and white mix-match is as hot as it gets. Not only is it stylish, but can flatter any figure, too. 
 
 
 
 Don’t want to reveal too much while you’re idling at the beach or by the poolside? Get a sarong. The cover-up is just as stylish in shades of blue or dark grey as it is in white. Go with a kaftan-top style, skirt, geometric print long dress or frill mini. 
 
 
 
 These are an absolute-must in keeping with the hot weather. How about a black crochet scrunchy or headbands in navy blue and polka dots a la Gossip Girl to match with your bikini! 
 
 
 
 Light and delicate, the crochet bag is an apt accessory, too. How about a deep blue tote as a carry-all to the beach? Perfect arm-candy, we say! 
 
 
 
 Want to grab some of that bohemian panache? Wear beads. Either worn on its own in a long necklace, multi-strands, earrings, cuffed bangles or mixed with stones, dark beaded jewellery can be eye-catching and goes with the summer look.
