PANAJI: Voices of dissent within the Congress party have started surfacing, with key members of the   block committee resigning from the party on Monday. The development comes a day after Congress general secretary   lashed out at the party’s senior leaders and some sitting MLAS for their role in demoralizing the party workers.

 “Due to the apathy and ego of a few leaders, we are losing capable leaders and, of late, we feel that all is not well in Congress at the block level. We are not taken into confidence for any decision making at the block level,” the Saligao Congress block members said after resigning en masse.
 
 The workers, including the treasurer of the block,  , said that the grand old party was in collusion with the BJP government, and was deliberately putting up a weak fight against BJP.
 
 “My loyalty to Congress and all my activities in the interest of the state and party building fell a little short of sycophancy and boot-licking, and thus, as per Congress’s definition, the garbage of BBSM was given a ticket for Mayem, even though the president had never heard of his name,” Kawthankar said.
 
 Kawthankar was vying for the Mayem constituency seat but lost out to   (BBSM) Mayem unit president Santosh Sawanth.
 
 Kawthankar said that he would continue to assist the party in the forthcoming elections but has been giving party functions a wide berth since Sawanth was announced as a candidate.
 
 “Don’t waste your vote on the Congress party. This will be the last fight for Congress. Congress and BJP have arrived at a deal and most of us are fed up that Congress keeps giving the tickets to the same people,” a disgruntled party worker said.
