PUNE: With   set to partner   once again in a Davis Cup   tie, the spotlight this time falls on non-playing captain   when India take on Uzbekistan in the Asia-Oceania Group 1 second-round clash in Bangalore from April 7 to 9.

 The national selectors picked a squad of six including four singles players Yuki Bhambri, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Sriram Balaji besides the two doubles specialists in New Delhi on Monday and the decision to select the final four will be up to the captain in consultation with the selectors a week or so before the tie.
 
 Given that the Uzbek team will feature Denis Istomin, the 30-year-old world No. 69 (formerly ranked 33), there can be no doubt about India's doubles combination since winning that rubber will be crucial to the final outcome.
 
 “If you look at the six, it's very clear that there can be only one doubles team. Now it's up to the captain to get the best out of the both of them,” an   source said, referring to Paes-Bopanna partnership. “It's not like they (Paes and Bopanna) have not played well before. But they have to get their act together.”
 
 India squad:
 
 Rohan Bopanna, Leander Paes, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Yuki Bhambri, Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Sriram Balaji.
