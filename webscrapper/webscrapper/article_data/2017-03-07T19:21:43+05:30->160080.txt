Actress   says that she didn’t want to react to the alleged nude video clip of hers that was   online, because she didn’t want to aggravate the issue. The video was leaked over the weekend from a supposedly hacked Twitter account. But, going by the way the news picked up and how the clip and other ‘exposes’ from the same account made it to national news, the   felt that she should clarify that it isn’t her and tell people to not spread such stuff through social media. 

 “What hurt me most is that this doesn’t involve only me. My family is also affected by it. But, to my good luck, my parents and family have stood by me and expressed their faith in me,” says Sanchita, adding that the news doesn’t really bother her. What struck her was the magnitude to which the issue blew up. “I’ve been patiently answering calls from everyone and talking. People who haven’t made mistakes, aren’t afraid to talk. I’ve always been true to my work and never bothered about anything else. In fact, there are hardly any rumours about me that have made headlines. I do not know who is behind this and what their motives are. Personally, I have no enemies either. But, I’m glad that I’ve received so much of positive support from everyone during these trying times,” adds Sanchita.
