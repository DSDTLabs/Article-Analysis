KOCHI: Though the number of couples who choose IVF treatment has increased in Kerala, the state government has scrapped the move to begin a reproductive medicine department at the   in Thiruvananthapuram. The process has already begun.

 Top health department officials said the government wouldn't be starting a reproductive medicine department. “For the time being, we don't plan to do so. Repro ductive medicine would continue to function with the gynaecology department,“ said  , health secretary . On how the government order can be cancelled with out sufficient reasons, Sadan andan said that he was una ware of such an order.
 
 The previous UDF government had issued or ders in 2015 to start the reproductive medicine de partment at Thiruvanan thapuram Medical College. In 2012 the state government started the first in vitro fertility (IVF) centre in the state at   (SAT) Hospital attached to Thiruvananthapuram medical college.Later, the government started IVF centres at Kozhikode and Kottayam medical colleges.
 
 Once reproductive medicine department is started, more specialists can be nurtured there. The issue of unavailability of specialists, which stood in the way of the government in starting IVF centre in more hospitals, could have been addressed to a certain extent if a dedicated department had started. The government had plans to start PG course with specialization in surgery courses (MCh) at medical college. Though   (MCI) would have allowed the course for medical college as the hospital already has an IVF centre which generated good results, authorities didn't even send an application after   assumed office as chief minister last year.
 
 All the three IVF centres at the government medical colleges have produced success stories. The centre in Thiruvananthapuram is now offering treatment for those registered in 2014, thanks to the long list of applicants. At the same time, more and more private hospitals are starting IVF centres.
