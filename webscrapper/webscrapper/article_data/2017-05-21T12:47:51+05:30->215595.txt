NEW DELHI: The strongest start to any   season, which spanned six consecutive wins, was followed by   becoming the first team to seal passage to the play-offs. Victory in their final league match made them the first T20 team to 100 wins, and confirmed them as the table-toppers with 20 points. 

 The Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai have been the outstanding team this IPL, with 10 wins from 14 matches. 
 
 Here, TOI Sports charts Mumbai Indians' road to the   final. 
 
 
 A narrow defeat which came down to the penultimate ball of the game. No fifties, but a late-order flourish from Kieron Pollard (27 off 17 balls) and Hardik Pandya (35* off 15) got Mumbai to 184, with Hardik clouting Ashok Dinda for 30 runs in the last over, striking four sixes and a four. The last seven deliveries cost 36, but in the end   squeezed home on the basis of skipper Steven Smith's unbeaten 84 off 54 balls. 
 
 
 This game also went down to the penultimate delivery, expect this time Mumbai were on the happy end. Chasing 179 after good bowling from Krunal Pandya (3/24), Mumbai surprised KKR by sending Nitish Rana at No 3, and the Delhi batsman clobbered 50 off 29 balls to keep the chase running. Hardik was the finisher again, hitting an unbeaten 29 off 11 balls to seal a tense win with one delivery left. 
 
 
 Another successful chase, with plenty of nerves. Harbhajan Singh (2/23) and   (3/24) starred as the defending champions were limited to 158/8, after which Parthiv Patel (39 off 24) and Rana (45 off 36) whittled away at the target. Mumbai, after a wobble, were indebted to Krunal's 20-ball 37 to take them to the doorstep of victory.
 
 
 By now it was evident that Mumbai's middle order was going to be a common theme. Chasing 143, the team was rocked by a hat-trick to Samuel Badree (4/9) in the Powerplay, but from a perilous scoreline of 7/4, Mumbai were stunningly bailed out by Pollard's 70 off 47 balls and a sensible 37 not out from Krunal. 
 
 
 Back home at the Wankhede, Mumbai were again taken towards victory by Rana (53) and Pollard (39), with skipper Rohit producing his first significant innings, an unbeaten 40 off 29 balls as a target of 177 was overhauled in 19.3 overs. 
 
 
 This chase had few tensions. Pushed onto the backfoot by Hashim Amla's unbeaten 104, with the South African punishing Lasith Malinga (0/58 in four overs), Mumbai were set a target of 199 on a very good batting surface. Their case was filled by Parthiv, who made 37 off 18 balls in an opening stand of 81 in 5.5 overs, and England import Jos Buttler, who was Man of the Match for his crackling 37-ball 77. Finishing the job was Rana, with an astonishing 62 off 34 balls that featured seven sixes but not one four. This was the highest successful chase of the season, and gave Mumbai their best start to any IPL. 
 
 
 An under-par total (142) was made to look far more menacing with New Zealand left-arm quick Mitchell McClenaghan stinging Delhi Daredevils with 3/24, and backed by Burmah's 2/21, the table-toppers extended their lead over KKR and SRH. Daredevils were left hurting at 24/6 and made a fist of it through Kagiso Rabada and Chris Morris, but Bumrah's guile at the death snuffed out their chase. 
 
 
 Another loss to their Maharashtra rivals, this won also by a very narrow margin. Chasing 161, Mumbai never found strong partnerships, and once Rana (58) was out, the lower order had a rare off day. Mumbai finished on 157/8, with RPS' millionaire Ben Stokes bowling superbly. With this loss, a six-match winning streak was snapped. Rohit was fined for showing dissent towards umpire S Ravi during the last over, bowled by Jaydev Unadkat, in which the Mumbai skipper felt a wide should have been called. 
 
 
 A nerve-shredding match ended with Mumbai somehow levelling the scores on 153, which set up a Super Over. Starring in the tiebreaker was Bumrah, who defended 11 runs to give his team the joint lead at No 1 on the leaderboard. 
 
 
 This win owed plenty to Rohit, who walked in at 61/2 and finished a chase of 163 with 56 not out off 37 balls, in 19.5 overs, with Hardik for company. Mumbai were back at the top. 
 
 
 Victory by a record margin sealed Mumbai's passage to the play-offs. A total of 212/3 owed to Lendl Simmons' 43-ball 66 and 63 not out from Pollard, with another Hardik cameo of 29 not out from 14 balls. In reply, Daredevils were steamrolled for a lowly 66 in 13.4 overs. Malinga (2/5), Harbhajan (3/22) and Karn Sharma (3/11) laughed themselves off the ground. 
 
 
 A total of 138/7 on a slow surface was not enough to stop SRH from cantering home. Rohit's 67 aside, no batsman crossed 23 and that told the story. After a rare failure from David Warner, it was Shikhar Dhawan (62*) and Moises Henriques (44) who steered SRH home with ten deliveries remaining. 
 
 
 An odd sort of defeat, for Mumbai looked on course to chase 231 at several junctures. Led by Wriddhiman Saha's unbeaten 93 and a crackling 47 from Glenn Maxwell, KXIP soared to 230/3. Simmons' 59 and Parthiv's speedy 38 laid a start of 99 in 8.4 overs before the slide started. Then Hardik (30 off 13) and Karn (19 off six) threatened to help Pollard to a stunning win, but their dismissals saw Mumbai end on 223/6 with Pollard not out on 50 from 24 balls. 
 
 
 In their last league match, Mumbai made six changes. The result was a nine-run win over KKR at Eden Gardens, which meant that they missed out on a top-two finish. Starring were Ambati Rayudu with 63 from 37 balls in his first match in five weeks, and Saurabh Tiwary with 52 in his first appearance. Mumbai defended 173 to confirm their place at No 1 and headed into the play-offs. This was their 100th win, the first T20 team to the milestone. 
 
 
 Having been asked to bat, RPS were carried by Rahane's 56 off 43 balls after the innings lurched to 9/2 inside two overs, but it was the alliance between Tiwary (58 off 48) and Dhoni (40* off 26) that really hurt Mumbai. The last two overs produced 41 as Dhoni struck five sixes, each shot giving Pune's fans reason to cheer. Then it was over to Washington Sundar, who produced his best performance of the season in reducing Mumbai's strong batting order to 51/4. Parthiv Patel's 52 kept the hosts in the hunt, but once he was dismissed by Thakur (3/37) in the 15th over the chase became too much. Mumbai lost to Pune for the third time in the season and had to then face KKR in the Qualifier 2. 
 
 
 On a tricky track, Rohit correctly called at the coin toss and expectedly put KKR in to bat. By the end of seven overs, KKR had slipped to 31/5 before Suryakumar Yadav (31) and Ishank Jaggi (28) added 56 runs that helped them past 100 runs. Led by Karn and Bumrah, who shared seven wickets, Mumbai bowled out KKR for a paltry 107. Mumbai lost Simmons, Parthiv and Rayudu cheaply in the Powerplay overs but Krunal (45*) and Rohit (26) ensured that was just a hiccup before they sealed the deal in 14.3 overs to enter the final.
