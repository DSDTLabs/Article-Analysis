VIJAYAWADA: The   members are planning a big event when party president Y S Jaganmohan Reddyâ€™s Praja Sankalpa Padayatra enters the city. Currently on it 122nd day in Satthenapalli, Guntur district, the padayatra is most likely to enter   in the second week of April. By the time   enters the city, he would have covered 29 capital villages. 

 The city of Vijayawada has become a vital seat of power in the state due to the capital city of Amaravati coming up in the outskirts. Keeping this fact in mind, the   leaders are planning to include some important leaders into the party in the presence of Jagan. 
 
 According to some of the reliable sources within the party, there are about a dozen second rung leaders who are ready to join the party in the presence of Jagan. Besides them, the leaders are also working on roping in some of the prominent names that would send positive signals down the lane.
 
 The party had leading industrialist Koneru Prasad as its Lok Sabha candidate for Vijayawada in the last elections. However, he left the party after the elections and may not be ready to contest again. Having lost a well-known leader like Koneru, the party needs a strong candidate for the Lok Sabha. It is also being speculated that Jagan would like to introduce a new face as and when he enters the city. 
 
 The sources added that industrialist and film producer Prasad V Potluri, who is known as PVP, is likely to be the candidate. In the last election, PVP had tried in the Vijayawada Lok Sabha seat from the Jana Sena, but, as Jana Sena did not contest the last election, his plans did not work out.
