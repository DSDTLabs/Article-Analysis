Coimbatore: City police appear to have achieved a major breakthrough in the   of a 36-year-old construction worker, whose   were found inside a locked house on Keeranatham Road at Saravanampatti two weeks ago. Police have managed to trace the identity of the suspect and formed special teams to nab him.

 Construction worker M Sivabalan’s skeletal remains were found in a rented house on Keeranatham Road on September 21. “Sivabalan was a native of Pollachi. After his mother passed away more than a decade ago, his father Mariappan had abandoned Sivabalan, his elder brothers and an elder sister. After Mariappan married another woman, his elder brother Periyasamy of Saravanampatti was taking care of Sivabalan and his siblings,” a police officer said.
 
 Sivabalan was addicted to alcohol and often fought with Periyasamy. He later moved to a rented house at Anna Nagar Kuttai on Keeranatham Road. Four months ago, Sivabalan told his uncle that he won’t be home for a few months as he was going to Udhagamandalam for construction work. When he failed to return even after three months, Periyasamy went to the rented house and found Sivabalan’s skeletal remains inside,” the officer said.
 
 As the front door of the house was locked from the outside, police suspected foul play. A special team led by assistant commissioner of police (law&order- east sub-division) D Suresh, Saravanamaptti police inspector Maheswaran and sub-inspector Ibrahim Basha came to know that another construction worker from Vilankurichi was staying with the deceased for one year. He had gone missing.
 
 Police traced the address of the suspect and met his parents. They have formed special teams, which are conducting searches at various construction sites in Anaikatti, Kalangal near Sulur and a few more places to nab the suspects. The suspect has not used mobile phone and not contact his parents for more than three months, police sources said.
