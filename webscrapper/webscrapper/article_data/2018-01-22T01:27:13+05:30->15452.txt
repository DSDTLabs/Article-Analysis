MUMBAI: Two weeks after TOI reported about a severe staff crunch at two BMC-run   medium DEd colleges—Mahim’s Rahmatullah Currimbhoy and Imamwada, municipal commissioner   on Saturday approved a proposal for appointment of teachers at the institutes.

 For the last four months, the Mahim institute has had no principal while a teacher has been acting in-charge principal at Imamwada College for the last four years. Imamwada College has just two teachers, including the in-charge principal, for 87 students, all of them girls. Several politicians and activists had petitioned the authorities to appoint teachers at these colleges. 
 
  Amin Patel who took up the issue with senior municipal authorities, including deputy municipal commissioner (education) Milind Sawant and education officer Mahesh Palkar, said: “It is good that the municipal commissioner has approved the teachers’ appointment. Eligible candidates should apply so that the vacant posts are filled as soon as possible.”
 
 Congress leader Mudassar Patel said he had to make several rounds of offices of the municipal authorities to get the work done. “Now, we expect the   to issue advertisements for the teachers’ posts soon,” he said. 
 
 Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh said: “For 25 years, no faculty has been appointed at the these teachers’ training colleges. The students suffered as teachers kept retiring and the seats remained vacant. Now, justice will be done.”
 
 “We are happy that the corporation has finally approved the appointments,” said Imamwada College principal Saira Patel. On International Women’s Day (March 8) last year, activists Farid Khan and Syed Furqan had led a demonstration outside Mantralaya, demanding teachers’ appointment.
