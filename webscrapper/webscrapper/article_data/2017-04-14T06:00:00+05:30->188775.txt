Visakhapatnam: Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) is planning to collaborate with retail giant Walmart to promote their products and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard is scheduled to be signed by the end of this month. 

 As per the MoU, Walmart will initially sell GCC’s products like Nannari Sherbat, Bilwa Sherbat, Honey and Araku Coffee and later introduce other products.
 
 Sources said the corporation sold around six lakh bottles of Nannari Sherbat last year. Though the product came late this year, GCC has managed to sell 50,000 bottles in just four days. Walmart has stores in Rajahmundry and Guntur in AP and Hyderabad in Telangana. It will start selling the products in both the Telugu states and then through all its setups in India.
 
 “GCC’s capacity and availability of raw material ten times higher than Patanajali and other brands. However, it lacks marketing potential. Once the terms and conditions are finalised, samplings and advertisement activities will be taken up by Walmart,” the GCC sources said.
 
 According to the sources, Walmart is planning to buy Rs 10 crore worth of GCC products in the next four to five years. 
 
 “Walmart is showing interest in GCC products as our products do not have any rival,” a senior employee of GCC said. 
 
 When contacted, GCC MD A Ravi Prakash said, “Walmart has shown interest in GCC and we have already discussed the MoU. GCC had achieved Rs 242 crore revenue in 2016-17 as against Rs 183 crore revenue in 2015-16.”
