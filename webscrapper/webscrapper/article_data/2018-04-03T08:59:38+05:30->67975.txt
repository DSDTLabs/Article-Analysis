BHOPAL: Alarmed by the   report for including   among the   in the country,   said on Monday that due to   many people have failed to avail benefit of welfare schemes. She said micro management is necessary for the development of the area.

 "The government has sufficient funds to implement welfare schemes, but beneficiaries were unable to avail the benefits because of lack of monitoring. There should be three-tier monitoring system and micro management for the development of the area", said Swaraj while addressing representatives of Vidisha parliamentary constituency on Monday.
 
 Swaraj who has been representing Vidisha Lok Sabha seat for the last two terms, stayed away from the constituency for long which resulted in poor development of the area. The NITI Aayog report came as shocker for the Union minister and the state government after claims that MP has moved ahead on the road of development. Swaraj, who reached the state capital in the morning, also reviewed education, health and functioning of aanganwadi workers. She suggested that monitoring of schemes should be done at the panchayat-level and representatives should take a feedback on the implementation of schemes
