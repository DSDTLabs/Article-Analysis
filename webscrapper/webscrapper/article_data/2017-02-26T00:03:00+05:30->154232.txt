BHOPAL: Think hard before you let your kid sit in city school buses or any vehicle enaged in ferrying students. Chances are most of such vehicles lack facilities for kids or lack woman conductors.

 Vehicles carrying kids to schools outnumber public vehicles when it comes to flouting traffic rules. As many as 421 vehicles were fined by traffic police Bhopal along with RTO, which include school vans (93),   (188) and school Magic (40), going by latest report of traffic police.
 
 The violations range from parking on wrong side, expired first-aid kits, overspeeding, no fire safety measurements, no speed governors, not wearing uniforms and no vehicle papers. “We regret we cannot fine school vehicles older than 10-15 years, which are a major threat to children,” said a traffic official engaged in checking duty.
 
 According to an amendment in MP Motor Vehicle Act, commercial vehicle older than 15 years were asked to go off road, but school buses have been exempted from this rule, which prevents cops and RTO official from imposing fine on older school buses.
 
 “There might be more school buses violating laws. This is despite the fact we have been conducting awareness programmes regularly after few accidents and students had a narrow escape. Since then we have tightened vigil on school buses, but we need cooperation from schools and parents to avoid such old buses,” said ASP (traffic) Sameer Yadav.
 
 As many commercial bus operators are toying with an idea to convert buses into school buses to escape taxes and enjoy other exemptions, officials at RTO are worrying no end.
 
 In case of private vehicles, as many as 7,166 challans were issued against two-wheelers and 2,094 against private vehicles.
