Stories — whether old or new, happy or sad — have always fascinated Hyderabadis. And to celebrate this eternal love for stories, a popular café in the city organised a storytelling session on Wednesday. People of all walks of life gathered at the venue and took turn to narrate different stories, some by their favourite authors and some, fresh from their notebooks. 
Age was no bar at the do and so was language as storytellers as young as 16 to 62-year-olds professed their love for probably one of the most ancient forms of entertainment known to man. 
 And stories flowed throughout the evening. From celebrated authors such as   and   to inspirational tales and small anecdotes highlighting different phases of narrators’ lives, the audience was treated to many tales that transported them to different times, places 
 and spaces. 
 A highlight of the evening was a young   dancer who narrated a story from the Mahabharata using mudras and aesthetics of the classical dance form and took a bow to a standing ovation from the audience.
