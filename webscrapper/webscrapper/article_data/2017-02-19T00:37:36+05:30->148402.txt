THANE: The TMC has launched a search engine for those wanting to confirm their names in the voting list and their respective polling station for the forthcoming civic elections. 

 The facility will prove beneficial for those who have been searching for their names and   after the   department had to revise the final list of voters till last week.
 
 Sanjeev Jaiswal, civic chief, launched the   http://tmcvotersearch.org/ that can be accessed by city residents to get details of their panel number, polling station and its address and location of their family and immediate neighbors on the polling list.
 
 “There is a usual rush for accessing these details on the day of elections at various booths in any area which also ends up in many voters deciding to not cast their vote. The search engine will provide vital information at the click of a button,” said Jaiswal. — Manoj Badgeri
