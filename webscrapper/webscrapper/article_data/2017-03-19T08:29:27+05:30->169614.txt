LUCKNOW/GHAZIPUR: In the end, it was Yogi Adityanath’s day. And that of his supporters. Since early Saturday, well before the   parliamentary board met to decide the party’s
  for  , supporters of the so-called front runners had lined up outside the party office. 

 Lucknow was swathed in all sorts of ‘kesariya’ and posters had popped up all over the city. At noon, cries of BJP supporters in favour of 
  and state president   rent the air. 
 
 In between, everyone chanted “Jai Shree Ram”. What played out a few hundred kilometres away, in Ghazipur, was no less dramatic. Perhaps for the first time, the local administration made arrangements for a ceremonial welcome, complete with a guard of honour, for a political leader who was mistaken as the CM-designate. 
 
 Amid speculations that he had been picked for the top job, when   minister   visited a village in his home district of Ghazipur, the district administration hastily arranged a grand welcome and a guard of honour. 
 
 The welcome, against official protocol, was turned down by Sinha, who chose to walk away instead. He later told reporters that he had no prior knowledge of the arrangements. The Yogi’s supporters promised that prasad from the Gorakhnath temple — besan ke laddoo made in desi ghee — will be distributed in Gorakhpur on Sunday. 
 
 Setting their eyes on the next target even before he was sworn in, many even said Adityanath will now be the top claimant for the Prime MInister’s office in 2019. 
 
 By 6 pm, when the news of the appointments poured in, every road in Lucknow led to one place: Lok Bhawan, the office of the chief minister. Over a hundred SUVs were seen parked from outside BJP office, Vidhan Sabha, LMC office till Hazratganj Chauraha.
