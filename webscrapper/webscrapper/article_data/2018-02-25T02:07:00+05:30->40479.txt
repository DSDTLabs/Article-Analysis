Visakhapatnam: The Andhra Pradesh   department plans to enhance tourist accommodation from 9,300 to 25,000 by 2025 under a public-private mode. It is currently working on six marquee projects including the   Island, INS Viraat, Gandikota, Havelock Bridge,   and Kakinada Swadesh Darshan. These were pointed out by state tourism secretary Mukesh Kumar Meena at a special session on tourism that was held on the inaugural day of the CII Partnership Summit on Saturday.

 Stating that Andhra Pradesh ranks third in domestic tourism in the country after Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, the tourism secretary said that of the 56 tourism-related MoUs signed on Saturday, 19 projects are related to hotels and accommodations. “However, most of our tourism is religion-related. Contribution to the economy will not increase unless we prolong the stay of the pilgrims by creating new places of interests, new destinations and developing infrastructure. New destinations should be aggressively promoted.”
 
 “To encourage private stakeholders, we are ensuring granting of all permissions (except those from the central government) within 21 days thereby focusing on the ease of doing business. We are also putting all such projects online,” added Meena.
 
 Stakeholders discussed strategies for development of tourism infrastructure and services in the upcoming tourist destinations in Andhra Pradesh. 
 
 They deliberated on the measures that should be taken to attract talent from the global hospitality sector to leverage their expertise and pay special attention to the challenges faced by companies across the tourism value chain.
