HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday directed   to file a detailed report on the murder of   leader   within three weeks from now.

 Justice A V   who heard a lunch motion moved by  , the wife of the deceased leader, seeking either a CBI probe or an inquiry through a special investigation team, sought all details pertaining to the murder and outcome of the investigation.
 
 
 Lakshmi, who is also the chairperson of Nalgonda municipality, sought call details of persons arrested by police in the case. Her counsel C Damodar Reddy told the court that the local TRS MLA Nakirekal Veeresam had been asking Srinivas to join TRS. The petitioner had serious doubts that Veeresam was instrumental in getting her husband killed as he was not heeding to the MLA’s requests.
 
 She also expressed doubt about the role of the police in the case as they consistently declined to offer protection to Srinivas despite repeated requests for the same. The SP’s premature declaration that this murder was not a political one and that it was the result of a road side clash done on the spur of the moment gave scope for more doubts, Damodar said.
 
 The judge referred to the media coverage and photos pertaining to arrests of the accused and observed that police stood along accused and made it difficult for the people to make a distinction.
 
 Telangana special counsel Sarat Kumar said the police had indeed collected the call data of the accused and it would be detrimental to the interests of the prosecution to divulge those details at this stage. “We will certainly brief the court about the progress when it is safe for us to do so,” he said and sought three weeks time. The judge gave three weeks time and adjourned the case accordingly.
