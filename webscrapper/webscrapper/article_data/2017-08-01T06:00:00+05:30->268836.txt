A fashion exhibition at a star hotel in   featuring works of gifted designers from all over India was a glitzy affair. 

 The three-day exhibition flaunted fabulous fashion and has become a talk of the town with its unique amalgamation of contemporary and modern style. Pretty ladies, dressed in their best, thronged the venue to update their wardrobe and up their style quotient. Among the city socialites and fashionistas, actress   of   fame was spotted trying some exquisite jewelleries. She was a sight to behold in a blue net saree.
