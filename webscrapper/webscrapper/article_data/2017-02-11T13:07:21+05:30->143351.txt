PANAJI: In a bid to foster regional bilateral ties and enhance maritime security cooperation, the Indian Coast Guard held joint anti-piracy and safety exercises off the coast of Goa. Held for the first time, the joint exercises included a warship from   and delegates from 14 countries.

 Overseen by commander for   Inspector General  , the operations involved five Indian Coast Guard vessels, a fleet of aircrafts and two hovercrafts. During the exercises, which were held in collaboration with Singapore’s ReCCAP Information Sharing Centre, the teams conducted anti-piracy operations including boarding of a hostile trawler and crew rescue.
 
 The exercise attains significance as the threat of armed robbery against ships remains alive in the South East Asian sea, even as piracy attempts have decreased along India’s western coastline.
 
 According to ReCAAP (Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia), a total of six incidents of armed robbery against ships were reported in Asia, in January 2017, though no incident of piracy was reported in the region. 
 
 “This is a 40% decrease in the total number of incidents as compared to January 2016. Between March 2016 and January 2017, a total of 11 actual incidents involving abduction of crew were reported to the ReCAAP ISC,” a delegate who was part of the exercise said.
