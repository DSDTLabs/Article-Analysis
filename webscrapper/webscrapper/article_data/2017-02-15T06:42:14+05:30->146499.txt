MANGALURU: The commencement of collection of toll at Talapady on Karnataka – Kerala border, Sasthan and Hejmady in Udupi on the National Highway 66 is burning a hole in passengers’ pocket due to resultant hike in bus fares.

 The KSRTC has hiked the fares of buses that pass through these toll gates following introduction of toll on the stretch between Kundapur and   66 from February 1. KSRTC Mangaluru divisional traffic officer M B Jaishanth told TOI that the fair on Mangaluru-Kundapur, Mangaluru-Udupi and Mangaluru-Kasargod routes has been revised considering the additional burden on the state run tansport corporations due toll payment at Gundmi, Hejmadi and Talapady. 
 
 While the fare between Mangaluru and Kasargod has been hiked to Rs 53 from Rs 50, the fare between Udupi and Mangaluru is hiked by Rs 4 and from Mangaluru to Kundapur by Rs 9. The new fares came into effect from February 13.
 
 Jaishnath said, the KSRTC buses have to pay Rs 110 for one way and 165 for two way as toll at Talapady. Similarly at Hejmady, each bus has to pay Rs 105 for one way trip and Rs 130 for one way at Gundmi toll plaza. A bus plying from Mangaluru to Kundapur has to pay toll at two plazas. “This is going to have a substantial impact on finances of the state run transport entities,’’ Jaishnath said while defending the upward revision of  .
 
 This move of KSRTC evoked strong reaction from the commuters. 
 
 People who travel regularly on Udupi-Mangaluru-Kasargod route have strongly condemned the decision and demanded that KSRTC withdraw the hike. 
 
 Meanwhile, minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs U T Khader has directed the   (RTA) to discuss the issue in its next meeting. “Before effecting any hike in bus fare, the RTA has to be consulted. So I have directed RTA to look into the matter,” he added.
