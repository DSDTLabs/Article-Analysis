PUNE:   on   on Wednesday trumped cash crunch blues as many people queued up at large stores across the city to buy gold.

 The mood has pleasantly surprised jewellers, who were expecting muted rise in sales. “This year, it has been extremely good…We have seen a growth of 25% over the last year’s Akshay Tritiya,” Vastupal Ranka, director of Ranka Jewellers, said.
 
 He said bulk of the buying, at about 60% in value, has happened by digital payment modes.
 
 Festive season buying accounts for about 10% of the total sales for jewellers. “This year’s Akshaya Tritiya is quite a surprise, there was a steady crowd since morning. In fact, the customers queued up even before the stores opened to capitalize on the morning mahurat,” Saurabh Gadgil, CMD, PNG Jewellers, said.
 
 Two-wheeler sales muted
 
 Two-wheeler sales remained muted compared to the previous few days with the Pune RTO registering about 600-odd bikes on Wednesday – more or less in line with what happened over the past few days.
 
 “It is less than last year and definitely lower than what we have seen during the previous few festival days,” said Shobha, a showroom manager, at a leading two wheeler showroom.
