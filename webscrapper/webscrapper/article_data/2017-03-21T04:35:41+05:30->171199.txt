NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Monday said that no   can stoop can stoop so low as to level   allegations that their child has been sexually assaulted and awarded 10 years jail to a 26-year-old man for raping a  .

 “No parent of a young daughter can stoop so low as to bring defame, dishonour and put her to disrespect with such serious allegations. Hence, this defence cannot be accepted or even believed,” said special judge Sanjay Sharma-I. 
 
 In his defence, accused Sonu had argued that the mother of the victim had borrowed money from him and to avoid the repayment, she had falsely implicated him using her daughter.
 
 Sonu was accused of raping his minor neighbour after bundling her and taking her to his room when everybody else was asleep. “It has to be borne in mind that the victim was a small child of 10 years at that time and was not belonging to a very well to do family, but despite that she explained all the acts of the accused with impunity, clarity and confidence,” the court said.
 
 It also observed that since Sonu did not submit any evidence to support his claim, his argument could not be believed or accepted. “In view of the above discussion , it has been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that accused Sonu aka Surender had taken the minor victim to his room and committed penetrative sexual assault upon her on July 23, 2014,” held the court.
 
 The prosecution had argued that the crime was carried out by the accused when the victim was sleeping along with her family in the open area of her house in north east Delhi and the accused took her to his room, gagged her and raped her. Subsequently, when her family heard her gagging noise they found her in the accused’s room and called the police.
