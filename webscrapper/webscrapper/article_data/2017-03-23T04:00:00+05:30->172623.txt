Ahmedabad: Despite frisking and checking, the issue of students carrying chits into the examination hall is very common. Concerned over the issue, state education board officials have submitted a memorandum to the district education officer (DEO), urging them to take up the issue seriously and decide upon the responsibilities of the centre coordinator and supervisor in view of the issue. In such cases, a copy case is not registered. The board has also urged the DEO to bring such cases to the board’s notice.

 On Wednesday, Class X students wrote their social studies paper while class XII science stream students wrote their first and second language exams. Class XII general stream students appeared for psychology exam.
 
 The Social Studies paper was a little tricky, found the students, even as most questions were directly from the textbook. Class XII science stream students on the other hand found the paper to be easy. Essays such as ‘Autobiography of a Mobile’ and ‘Prohibition on Guthka’ were mentioned in the first language paper.
 
 Around 20 copy cases were registered on Wednesday against four class X students and 16 students of class XII general stream, from across the state. One of these cases was also reported from Tripada School based in Ahmedabad. Apart from these, the second case of dummy student appearing for the exam was also reported from a centre at Bharuch.
