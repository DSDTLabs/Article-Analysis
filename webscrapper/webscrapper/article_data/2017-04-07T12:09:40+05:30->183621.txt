CHENNAI: A mystery parcel allegedly containing anthrax created a flutter at the office of a leading software company on   (OMR) in   on Wednesday. The parcel also enclosed a letter threatening to kill corrupt officials in the company. 

 The parcel was handed over to security officer  , who later informed company officials. Since there was no sender's address mentioned, officials grew suspicious about the contents. Subsequently, they informed the   police station. 
 
 Police opened the parcel which contained a sachet of white powder and a piece of paper saying that the sachet contained anthrax. The letter claimed there was large-scale corruption in the company and that such parcels would soon reach all the corrupt officials. 
 
 The sender threatened to mix the powder in water and splash it on the tainted officials to kill them. The letter also demanded a sum of 500 crore to prevent the sender from carrying out the threat. Police have sent a sample from the sachet to the forensic laboratory for chemical analysis. 
 
 Police sources said that the letter also bore traces of white powder, but were not sure whether it was anthrax. "We are collecting   footage to identify the person who dropped the parcel at the company," said an investigating officer. "We are also collecting details of employees who were recently sacked by the company. We cannot rule out their involvement," the officer said. 
 
 The local police who registered a case later transferred the case to the Central Crime Branch police.
