GUWAHATI: After the bitterly fought election, the ruling Naga People’s Front ( ) took guard against any possible attempts by   to hijack victory from its hands in the event of fractured verdict.

 
 On Saturday the ruling party submitted copies of its pre-poll agreements with National People’s Party and JD(U) to governor PB Acharya in order to block post-poll manipulations by BJP, which this time has tied up with Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) led by Neiphiu Rio. For last three terms BJP was an ally of NPF.
 
 In the joint cover letter to the governor, NPF president Shurhozelie Lietzietsu,   state president Ato Yepthomi and JD(U) state president Senchumo Lotha stated, “The alliance is confident of getting absolute majority ... We would together be staking claim to form the government ... we would request you to consider our claim as per established norms and as per the majority secured by the alliance.”
 
 They stated that that three parties have entered into an agreement prior the election on February 27. They made it clear that NPF contested in 58 seats, NPP in 25 and JD(U) in 13 and in some these the contests were friendly.
 
 The three leaders on behalf of their respective parties also stated in the letter that the alliance has decided TR Zeliang will be the chief ministerial candidate.
 
 When asked the necessity of submitting the pre-poll agreement copies to the governor, NPF secretary   told TOI, “What happened in Manipur and Goa? BJP, in spite of not being the single largest party, it could manipulate and take control of the states. So we are taking a precautionary step here.”
 
 NPF, which may just manage to come out as the single largest party but not enough seats to form the government on its own, is also aware of the equations that its new ally, NPP, has with BJP in Manipur, where they are partners in the government, and the possibilities of NPP joining hands with BJP in   in the post-poll scenario.
