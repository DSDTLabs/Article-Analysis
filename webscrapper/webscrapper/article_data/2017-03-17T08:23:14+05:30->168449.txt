NEW  : The Jat quota agitators, who have threatened to march to Parliament on March 20, have been denied permission to hold protests within the capital. 

  has already formed a three-tier security ring to prevent agitators from entering the city and seven companies of security forces, including 32,000 police personnel, have been put on guard at 20 border posts to stop protesters from sneaking in. 
 
 Cops will also keep a watch on trains and buses arriving from Haryana and western UP and the police in the neighbouring states have been asked to inform Delhi Police about any bulk booking of tickets. Any agitator entering the city will be booked for unlawful assembly if he forcefully tries to reach any   destination. 
 
 Sources said that as per intelligence inputs, more than 3,000 protesters have already gathered in different places in the villages along the borders.
 
 The Delhi Police spokesperson, DCP (crime)  , said, “Our aim is to keep agitators out of the city. We have requisitioned anti-riot forces to ensure that even small groups are not allowed to gather. No permission has been granted for any protest at designated areas like Ramlila Maidan or   as well.” Ten temporary jails are also being set up at border points. 
 
 Police officers from west, southwest and outer districts have been asked to ensure limited access to goods vehicles across the border posts. Cops will also keep an eye on protesters trying to disrupt or block entry of essential supplies to Delhi. “We will use adequate force to keep things normal,” said an officer.
 
 The civic bodies have been requested to keep construction materials and boulders out of bounds for common people to prevent miscreants in the city from blocking roads in border areas.
