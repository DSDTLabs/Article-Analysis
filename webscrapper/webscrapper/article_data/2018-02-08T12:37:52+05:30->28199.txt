VADODARA: Sudhir  , assistant director of parks and gardens department of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), who was nabbed by anti-corruption bureau for accepting a bribe from contractor Rajesh alias Lalji Padhiyar, on February 2 sought bail from sessions court on Wednesday. 

 His plea will come up for hearing on Thursday.
 
 In his application, Limbachiya has alleged that the complaint is completely botched up and that he was only asking for money which he had lent to Padhiyar in January 2017. Limbachiya claimed that he and Padhiyar were old friends and since he wanted money for social work, he had transferred Rs 40,000 through electronic transfer in his firm’s account. Padhiyar gave him a cheque of same amount some days later but on depositing, the cheque bounced due to insufficient balance in Padhiyar’s account, said Limbachiya.
 
 As he needed money, he kept reminding Padhiyar after which the latter gave him Rs 11,000 cash. Limbachiya also said that he kept asking for remaining Rs 29,000 through cheque but Padhiyar insisted on returning the money in cash and informed ACB with false complaint.
 
 He also stated that the bill which Padhiyar claims to be cleared by Limbachiya was to be paid by Jan Mahal Company as the tree was to be shifted from the site where the structure is proposed to come up opposite the railway station. Limbachiya also sought bail on the grounds that the work where Padhiyar had done does not fall under his zone. The site opposite railway station falls under another supervisor of the department.
 
 Limbachiya was held from a tea-stall near the Kashiba Children’s Hospital in Karelibaug when he took the money from Padhiyar. Padhiyar alleged that Limbachiya had demanded bribe to clear his Rs 1.28 lakh bill.
