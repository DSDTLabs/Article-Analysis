Vijayawada: The Amaravati   is set to get a shot in its arm with international agencies coming forward to support the project.

 The   Metro Rail Corporation (AMRC) is exploring the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to execute the project - something that became inevitable ever since the Union government in its Metro Rail Policy 2017 made PPP a mandatory component in order to avail financial assistance from the Centre.
 
 AMRC was initially mooted as a medium metro project in 2015 with the support of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The project was however later converted into a light metro as per the suggestions of the Union finance ministry, for which a new detailed project report (DPR) was to be made.
 
 KFW Germany later came forward to fund the DPR for the project. The government later signed a pact with SYSTRA to prepare the DPR. AMRC had intensified DPR works and is now searching for investors for the project in PPP mode. 
 
 “We are soon going to invite tenders for the Visakhapatnam Metro Rail under PPP mode and will want to continue the same with Amaravati Metro. KFW has already agreed to fund the government to construct a metro rail in Amaravati and the project cost will be less as it is a light metro project,” said NP Ramakrishna Reddy, who is on the board of directors of Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation.
 
 The revised metro policy had become a major obstacle for smaller cities in pursuing metro rail dreams and PPP mode will be helpful for us to seek Central funds, Ramakrishna Reddy added.
 
 “Extended corridors of metro rail will pass through the airport in Gannavaram and we cannot take up elevated metro rail project there as per the AAI guidelines. We are in proposals to build an underground line for 2-5 km there,” Reddy said.
