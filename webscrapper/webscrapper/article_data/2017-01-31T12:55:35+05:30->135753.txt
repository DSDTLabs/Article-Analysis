  ' popular show ' ' is all set to make history with its spin-off show ' '.
 
  The first promo of the spin-off is already out and we just cannot wait.
  
  'Dil Bole Oberoi' will focus on Rudra Singh Oberoi ( ) and Omkara Singh Oberoi's ( ) love story with Nehalaxmi Iyer and Shrenu Parikh.
  
  Also, 'Ishqbaaz' will show the story of Shivika-Shivaay Singh Oberoi ( ) and Anika (Surbhi Chandna).
  
  
 
  
  The makers of 'Ishqbaaz' were unable to focus on the lives of Om and Rudra and so the spin-off will have all the scope for it.
  
  According to an online entertainment portal,   contestant   has been roped in for 'Dil Bole Oberoi'.
  
  Rahul's appearance will play a major role in the plot and will be seen as an antagonist in it.
  
  Though nothing is confirmed yet, but watching Rahul Dev as the 'bad man' should be fun.
