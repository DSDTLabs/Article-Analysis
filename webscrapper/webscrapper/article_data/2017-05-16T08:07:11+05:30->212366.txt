BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh's technical education department will sign   with   (CII) and   in Mumbai on May 19 with an aim to   in  . 

 The department hopes to rope in the two organizations and allow them to use engineering college labs to enhance cooperation between industry and students and improve academics. 
 
 Sources said the technical education department is eyeing to improve the placement figures from engineering colleges in the state to 15,000-20,000 annually.
 
 "During the meeting with Nasscom and CII the department will convince them that there is a large scope of engineering studies in the state. Almost every colleges have huge infrastructure and they can use it. Through this, students studying in that college will be benefited as they also get the opportunity to get training," said a senior official without quoting his name.
 
 Department wants the industry bodies to tell colleges about industry requirements and make adequate arrangements so that students can get better job prospects. "This idea will also help us opening several avenues for the students. In a group of 50-60 students they could be taken by the companies regularly," said officials. 
 
 Incidentally, the technical education department is keen to improve the placement scenario in the state. Last year, it had decided to start a placement society which would work round the year and provide placement facilities to the engineering students. However, that scheme could not take shape.
 
 Besides, Rajiv Gandhi Proudhyogiki Vishavidyalaya had also announced a centralised placement system but that turned out to be a failure. There are around 80,000 seats in 219 engineering colleges across the state.
 
 At present, around 20% students who have completed their degrees from the state are being placed in different companies every year. 
 
 In 2016, around 11,011 students were placed while around 50,000 students took admission for 80,000 available seats. In 2015, there were 89,000 seats against which 47,000 students took admissions. In all, 10,708 students were placed from different engineering colleges in the state. While in 2014, there were 95,000 seats wherein 55,000 seats were filled. In 2013, there were 98,000 seats in the state and 56,000 seats were filled. In all, 7,208 students were placed.
