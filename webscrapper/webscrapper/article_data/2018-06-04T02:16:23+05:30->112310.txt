SHILLONG/GUWAHATI: After three days of unrest,   had a few peaceful hours on Sunday — only to be disturbed by violence that erupted again in defiance of the curfew in the evening. Security forces had to resort to firing teargas shells in violence-hit areas.

 
 The curfew, which had been imposed in several areas of the city since Friday morning, was lifted for seven hours on Sunday. “The curfew was relaxed from 8am to 3pm and people went to the church. The   has been kept on standby,”   deputy commissioner PS Dkhar told TOI. 
 
 Hours after the curfew was imposed again, miscreants attacked police and Army at different locations around Punjabi Lane, epicentre of the four-day-long spell of violence.
 
 According to reports, a cameraperson of a national TV channel was injured after he was hit by a stone pellet from a catapult used by the miscreants. Violence had erupted in the city last Friday after an altercation between some people and bus drivers and conductors at the Punjabi Lane area. 
 
 
 
 A delegation of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee visited the trouble-torn Punjabi Lane area and dismissed reports of Sikhs in Shillong being under threat from the Khasi community. 
 
 The delegation included Delhi BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa. “No Sikh individual was attacked and no family displaced and kept in camps,” Sirsa said after meeting locals.
