Thane: Near 1,290 students seeking admissions under the   ( ) law were allotted the   in the neighbourhood in the second selection round conducted by the district   office on Tuesday. And to ensure that all the students take up their allotted seats the state officials have put the onus on the school authorities to individually call up the applicants and ensure that the   process is completed. 

 “The schools have been instructed to be pro-active and reach out to the applicants as the results of the first round of allotment were not were encouraging. In fact, more than 30% of the 5,042 students abstained from taking admission to the schools allotted to them under the RTE. It defeats the entire purpose of the law and so we have asked the schools to take the necessary efforts to get the students admitted,” a district education official told TOI.
 
 Of the total 8,409 RTE applications in Thane district this year, as many as 5,042 were selected in the first round of the lottery system last week. However of these, only 3,444 students managed to claim their seats. While a miniscule 127 were rejected for faulty documents, a baffling 1,471 selected students didn’t approach the schools to complete the process, thus losing their opportunity to seek education this year.
 
 “We don’t want this to repeat in the second round,” the official said.
 
 The 1,290 students selected in the second round on Tuesday were sent SMSs informing them about the allotment of the school, leading to a long queue of parents outside schools to complete the admission process.
 
 The selected students will have complete the admission procedure by April 8 after which the dates of the next lottery round will be announced. The school will have to upload their admission status by April 10.
