CHANDIGARH: The commuters are having a tough time travelling through the road along Sector 40 and Sector 8 after the chopped branches of trees were left on its sides. The teams from Chandigarh municipal corporation have left their job half done dumping the parts of the trimmed trees alongside the road making it prone to accidents. 

 Vaibhav Gupta, a commuter said, “The trimmed branches have been dumped at the corner of the road blocking the view which can lead to fatal accidents. When will the authorities think about the well being of the people and remove the branches from the roads and foot paths?” he asked.
 
 The trees were also found lying on the footpath meant for the pedestrians in Sector 40. Aman  , a pedestrian said, “If this space too remains occupied by the broken tree branches, where are we supposed to walk through. These should be removed immediately so that they do not cause problem to anyone.”
 
 The trees left behind not only eat up the space, but also cause traffic snarls especially on the slip roads in Sector 8. Aparna  , another commuter said, “The branches were dumped just in front of the petrol pump. I had a tough time in taking my car out as most of the space was occupied by the cut parts of the pruned trees. 
 
 Another commuter   said, “There is a certain system to do things, and the authorities have mastered in leaving the job half done. Firstly, the trees are not trimmed regularly, and when it is done, the leftovers create trouble for people.”
 
 A major trouble was faced by people visiting the petrol pump where vehicles lined up one after the other as the branches were left on the road leaving very little space for the cars to make a double line.
 
 Devnath Tripathi, a commuter said, “The municipal corporation must carry out things in a systematic manner. One can get severely injured while commuting through the roads as the parts of the trimmed trees lie randomly.”
