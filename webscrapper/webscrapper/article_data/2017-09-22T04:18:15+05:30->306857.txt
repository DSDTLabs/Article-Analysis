MUMBAI: After months of speculation about joining  , former Maharashtra chief minister   has finally quit the  , blaming what he called a coterie around   Gandhi for sabotaging his career. The Shiv Sainik-turned-Congressman chose not to elaborate on his immediate plans except to say he would travel around the state, presumably to drum up support.

 “I have sent my   letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. I was promised the post of chief minister four times, but they did not honour it,” Rane said at a press meet in Kudal, his hometown in the Konkan region.
 
 Rane has resigned as MLC too. Thursday onwards, he will be on a tour, starting in Nagpur, hometown of CM Devendra Fadnavis, and moving to Nanded, which is state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s pocketborough. 
 
 Rane is likely to rally sections in Congress and Shiv Sena which are discontented with the present leadership in their parties, and try to build a critical mass that could help him to negotiate terms in the build-up to the 2019 assembly polls.
