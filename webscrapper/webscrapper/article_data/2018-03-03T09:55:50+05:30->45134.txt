MARGAO: Over two years after the new council owing allegiance to town and country planning minister   stormed to power, the   ( ) has failed to make any headway in the multi-level pay parking project that has been grounded ever since the foundation stone for the Rs 6.5 crore project was laid in September 2015. 

  The delay in commencing the project was initially attributed to red-tapism in obtaining the necessary sanctions from the authorities, and later to the change in Goa Schedule of Rates ( ) that necessitated preparation of estimates afresh before inviting tenders. However, the GST regime, rolled out in July 2017, further hit the project after the contractor refused to accept the work order fearing that he would have to cough up Rs 18% of the project cost towards GST. 
 
 After seeking legal opinion over the matter which further consumed much time, the MMC has now referred the project to the PWD for calculation of the GST on each tendered item.
 
 The multi-level pay parking will have 4,881.15 sq m of built-up area comprising a basement, ground floor and five floors. The topmost floor will house the pay parking maintenance unit which will be set up by MMC while all other floors will provide parking facility for 113 four-wheelers. There is also a provision for parking 42 two-wheelers, it is learnt.
 
 What's ironical is that the Rs 3 crore the MMC received from the government as Golden Jubilee grants in 2011 will be spent on the project - seven years after the grants were released, aimed at constructing a signature project in every town. The remainder of the amount will be sourced from the unutilized grants the MMC has in its coffers.
