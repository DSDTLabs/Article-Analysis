The city risks a harrowing time during the monsoon, which is less than three weeks away as per forecasts, unless the firm laying three   corridors plugs a series of gaping holes it has left at construction sites. 

  
 The BMC has identified 45 important locations across the city where storm water drains, other drains and manholes have been damaged because of ongoing Metro-related work. 
 
 
 
  
 
 It fears that rainwater flow will be impeded, with unimaginable consequences on heavy rain days. The civic body on Wednesday issued a spot-byspot to-do list to the Metro’s construction firm to take immediate remedial action, after ameeting with representatives of   and  . “We visited construction sites in April and again on May 5 to gauge the situation. Apart from drainage problems, we found that at many places extra water entry/exit points and a sufficient number of dewatering pumps are needed for smooth discharge of rainwater,” said a civic official. 
 
 
  At many sites, massive underground blockages have been created because of the accumulation of debris. Overground, barricading near private properties will impede surface flow of rainwater. 
 
 “The barricades must be realigned bearing this in mind,” an official said. 
 
 “Vehicular parking at certain locations too is a problem, though we are sure it will be restricted during the monsoon as a preventive measure.” Advocate and activist Godfrey Pimenta said, “I live at  , where work on Metro 3 is in full swing. 
 
 That the drains are damaged because of this can be clearly seen. There are also huge pits at the work sites. We fear these will remain uncovered and get filled with water during the rains.” Churchgate resident  , who lives on  , where two manholes and some drains lie damaged due to Metro piling work, said pedestrians will be inconvenienced in particular. 
 
 “As it is there’s little space for walking. When the rains start, if this area gets waterlogged, walking will simply become impossible.”
