CALANGUTE: Calangute police on Friday registered a murder case against 15 Telangana   who were arrested last week for assaulting four locals in the tourist hub. 

 One of them, Jayesh Bhandari, 22, succumbed to his injuries at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim. 
 
 The police said they’ll now seek custody of the 15 tourists, who are currently in judicial custody. 
 
 The incident pertains to a fight on the night of January 1. Bhandari, who hails from Sanguem, had been working as a taxi driver in Calangute. He was friends with Remy Rebello, a waiter at a local guesthouse at which the tourists were staying. 
 
 “The   tourists had allegedly been quarrelling among themselves in an inebriated condition. They assaulted first the waiter and later the manager,” said Calangute police inspector Jivba Dalvi said.
 
 The tourists then overheard Rebello, the waiter, calling his friends for help. “The tourists waited outside the guesthouse and when the two friends arrived on the scene, they assaulted them brutally,” said Dalvi.
 
 Bhandari and Rajesh Bhirodkar, 30, suffered severe head injuries. “Their heads were banged on the electricity pole outside the guesthouse,” said Dalvi.
 
 Dalvi said Bhirodkar was later discharged from the hospital, and police have recorded his statement.
 
 Calangute police had initially registered an offence of attempt to murder against the 15 tourists as well as under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon) r/w section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed of common object), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 They have now added Section 302 IPC following Bhandari’s death.
