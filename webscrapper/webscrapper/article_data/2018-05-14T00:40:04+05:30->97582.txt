Tirupur: Even though welcoming the Centre’s decision to continue with providing incentive at the increased rate under Merchandise Exports from Indian Scheme (MEIS) beyond June 30, knitwear industrialists urged the government to look into other schemes which had decreased returns due to lowering of rates.

 After the implementation of GST, the government had reduced rates of duty drawback and rebate of state levies to 2% and 1.7% from 7.7% and 3.5% respectively. As the reduction took a toll on the exporters, they continuously urged the Centre to cover the shortfall, which was 4.7% lesser than pre-GST period.
 
 In November, the government increased MEIS rate to 4% from 2% and announced that it will be valid till June 30. And now, Directorate General of Foreign Trade has announced that the increased rate will continue beyond June 30.
 
 “It is a major relief when the exporting units are struggling to sustain after the reduction of duty drawback and RoSL. The export orders were usually taken six months ago, so if MEIS was not continued at 4%, exporters would have faced losses,” said Tirupur exporters’ association president Raja M Shanmugham. He also urged the Centre to extend the validity period. 
 
 The exporters wanted the government to solve the other issues too. “The government was taking steps to withdraw the incentives given to the apparel industry due to pressure from the World Trade Organisation,” said A Sakthivel, regional chairman of Federation of Indian Export Organizations (southern region).
