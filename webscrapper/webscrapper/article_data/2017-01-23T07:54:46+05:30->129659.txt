BAREILLY: In a strange turn of events, two   candidates from   found that their names had been interchanged, in what the district president said was a "clerical mistake". When the matter was brought to the notice of the senior leadership in the party, the candidates were informed that their tickets had been cancelled, leaving them utterly puzzled about the reason. 

 Zafar Beg, the party's aspiring candidate from Bareilly Cantt seat and  , from the Bareilly City constituency discovered that in the candidates' list announced by the senior leadership on Saturday, their names had been interchanged. They then approached district president Subhlesh Yadav to get it corrected.
 
 "They met me and informed me about the problem. At first glance it appeared to have been a clerical mistake. We spoke to the senior leadership, who assured us that proper steps would be taken," said SP's Bareilly district president Subhlesh Yadav. However, when Beg and Sharma later contacted the senior party leadership, they were informed that their candidature for the seats, far from being rectified, had been cancelled.
