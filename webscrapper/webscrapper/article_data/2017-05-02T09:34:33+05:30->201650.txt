The trailer of   and Shruti Haasan’s romantic comedy ‘Behen Hogi Teri’ is out and is interesting enough to keep you hooked. Taking a dig at the pledge we took during our school days “India is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sisters”, the film is a story of Gattu, who falls in love with his neighbour Binny.

 
 
 The fun trailer traces the life of Gattu who is, by default, expected to treat the girl in his neighbourhood as his sister. But love knows no boundaries and what happens further remains for the viewers to watch out for. Rajkummar takes a dig at Shah Rukh Khan’s on-screen character name Rahul too. The film also stars   and 'Bigg Boss 8' winner  . 
 
 Directed by  , ‘Behen Hogi Teri’ is set to hit the theatres on May 26, 2017.
