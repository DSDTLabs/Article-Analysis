NEW DELHI: A 20-year-old youth was allegedly force-fed   by a group of men after they got into an argument with him at his   in southeast Delhi’s Sangam Vihar on Tuesday. The accused are absconding, while the victim is battling for life at AIIMS Trauma Center.

 The youth’s father, Balbir, said, “Yogesh was about to close his shop when the accused, a neighbour, came there with two of his friends. They thrashed my son, held him at gunpoint and poured the liquid from a plastic bottle into his mouth.”
 
 However, the statement of Yogesh’s sister, on the basis of which the FIR was registered, doesn’t mention the use of a gun. She heard her brother’s screams for help from an adjoining shop and saw her brother struggling to free himself from the clutches of the three men. She claimed the accused fled before she could reach there with a few locals. The bottle has been recovered by the police.
 
 Balbir alleged that a day before the accused had come to the shop to buy paneer (cottage cheese), which was out of stock. He didn’t believe Yogesh and insisted upon entering the shop and checking for himself. “When we drove him out of the shop, he threatened to take revenge,” he said.
 
 “A case was registered at Sangam Vihar police station. Two people have been detained for questioning,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
 
 Cops are also probing whether Yogesh consumed the acid himself. “There are no external injuries which raises this suspicion,” said a police officer.
