It looks like the construction of   building is on in full swing. Actor and Nadigar Sangam general secretary   posted few pics from the construction site on his micro-blogging page yesterday. He posted, “About last night!! The   @ Nadigar Sangham is shaping up beautifully well....GB.” He also posed for a picture with the workers. The construction is expected to be completed by September 2018. The work on the building started after actors   and   laid the foundation stone for it in April 2017. 

 The actor had earlier stated that a 1000-seater auditorium would be constructed on the 18-ground property since there was no auditorium to organize award functions. There will be 800-seat marriage hall and a small 300-seat mini-hall. There will be parking space and the halls will be given free of cost for the members,
