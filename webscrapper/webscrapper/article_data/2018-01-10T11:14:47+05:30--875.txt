TRICHY: Demanding to release the required water in   to save the standing samba paddy crop in delta districts, a section of farmers headed by the president of All Farmers Associationsâ€™ Coordination Committee,   staged a sit-in in front of the office of the chief engineer, River conservation division, here on Tuesday.

 A memorandum submitted to the divisional engineer   said that samba paddy cultivation has been carried out on 10 lakh acres in Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and   districts. As it is at a maturing stage, watering is a must.
 
 However, due to no water in irrigation channels, farmers have started to worry about their standing crops, as they are in a state of withering condition, said the memorandum. Irate by the apathy of the officials of concerned departments and the state government, farmers resorted to staging protest across the delta districts, they alleged.
 
 Considering the plights of the farming community, the union government should come forward to do the needful to release the due share of 63 tmc water in Cauvery. For that, the state government should pressurise Prime Minister Modi, they said
