LUCKNOW: Punjab regained the   A Senior Men National Championship thanks to two late goals to keep   at bay with a 2-1 win at   stadium.

 
 This was Punjabâ€™s second title win in eight years and fifth appearance in the final. And on Sunday, they proved why they are such a dominant force by dishing out all-round hockey and more importantly not panicking after conceding an early goal off a penalty corner.
 
 After Gurjinder Singh put Petroleum Board ahead in the third minute, the Punjab players led by their talented skipper Gurbaz Singh clawed back into the game slowly, but surely. With Gurbaz playing the dual role of a medio and also a linkman to perfection, the Punjab side looked the better outfit on the day.
 
 After Petroleum Board somehow managed to maintain their lead till the third quarter, it was celebration time for the Punjab players in the final quarter. In that period they were all over the Petroleum Board half harassing their defense. That pressure helped them to earn three short corners.
 
 The first one was wasted as Sarvanjit Singh pushed weakly from the line. Off the second one, the drag-flick of   found the feet of Petroleum Board defender Vickram Kanth. And Sarvanjit made amends to his earlier lapse by pushing home the resultant penalty stroke in the 53rd minute.
 
 Earlier Railways defeated Air India 6-4 via tie-breaker to clinch the third spot. After both the sides ended 1-1 after the regulation period, all the five Railways players scored off the resultant shoot-out, while only three were successful for Air India.
 
 In the actual action, Sayyad Niyaz Rahim had put Railways ahead in the fifth minute, while Shivender Singh restored parity for Air India in the 17th minute.
 
 
  Punjab 2 (Sarvanjit Singh 53rd, 60th ) beat Petroleum Board 1 (Gurjinder Singh 3rd)
