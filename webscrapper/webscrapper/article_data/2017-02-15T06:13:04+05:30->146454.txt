KOCHI:  , an internationally renowned textile artist, trains the rehabilitated students at  , the natural   of  , how to dye clothes using shibori technique. It is the method of creating eye-catching colour patterns by folding, twisting, bunching and tying before dipping in dyes.

 The story of how Yoshiko Wada connected with the Munnar-based school is also interesting. Ratna Krishnakumar, the managing trustee of  , which runs the school, tells the story: “At one point, I said, we should go beyond dyeing and looked for books and found one on shibori and brought it to Aranya.We tried various things from it ­ some were successful and others weren't, because you can't just learn it from a book like that".
 
 “Once, while attending a conference at Kolkata, I was told that Yo shiko Wada, an expert of shibori, was attending it. So I went to her and asked her will you teach my children at Aranya. But, she said she can't as she was booked for the next one-anda-half years. I said we will wait and gave her my card. In return, she gave me a postcard and while flipping it, I saw the picture of the book on the other side of it ­ the one we had been following all this while. So I told her, you have to come, because you were our teacher in absentia. Then she got more information from me on Aranya and she was here in six months,“ said Ratna Krishnakumar.
 
 That was during the beginning of 2005. “Since then, she is coming here every year with a group of textile enthusiasts. She taught us shibori, the techniques of how to fold, how to tie and stitch. She taught us things she wouldn't otherwise teach her students,“ Krishnakumar said. According to her, Wada is responsible for the success of Aranya, which clocked a turnover of Rs 1 crore last year.
