HYDERABAD: The   has given the green signal for laying of new broad gauge railway line between   station. Though the rail line is only for 53.20-km kilometre, it is crucial in terms of transportation of coal and checking pollution.

Also, the existing thermal power plant of TS genco at Kothagudem too receives coal supplies by road. The new Bhadadri thermal power plant scheduled to be completed by December 2017 will also be allocated coal from SCCL mines. Once the railway line comes up, it will be the end of pollution on the road caused by the coal-carrying lorries.
