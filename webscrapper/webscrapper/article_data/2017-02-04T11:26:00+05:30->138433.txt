JALANDHAR: Soon after Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sadua declared its support to SAD-BJP alliance, social media was abuzz with some people criticizing the Akalis for taking support from Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is a much hated figure among certain Sikh groups ever since he allegedly dressed up as Guru Gobind Singh in 2007.

 Several messages in Punjabi, cartoons and jokes have gone viral on social media after the Dera decided to back the ruling alliance in Punjab. There were widespread protests in 2015 when the   had pardoned the Dera head for his act.
 
 With Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its supporters raising the incidents of sacrilege in several parts of Punjab, the support from the Sirsa dera has come as another weapon for them to attack Akali Dal with. A string of instances of sacrilege of the Sikh holy scriptures were reported from across Punjab in October 2015, which had led to widespread protests and sit-ins. The anger had intensified after two Sikhs were killed in police firing on the protesters.
 
 Some BJP leaders also expressed apprehensions that the development could backfire for the SAD-BJP alliance. Despite the criticism from certain quarters, prominent seminary Damdami Taksal’s head   and some other Sikh religious figures, including former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode, issued an advertisement extending support to SAD.
 
 Other prominent Sants, who issued such an appeal to ‘Khalsa Panth and Punjabis’ include Baba Lakha Singh Nanaksar, Baba Sukhdev Singh Bhucho, Sukhchain Singh Dharampura and Baba Balbir Singh of Budha Dal. “The anti-Panth and anti-Punjabi forces should be given a befitting reply,” their appeal said.
 
 They also attacked Congress and AAP while showering praise on SAD. In response to this, over 90 other Sants issued a separate statement to dissociate themselves from Dhumma’s support to SAD.
