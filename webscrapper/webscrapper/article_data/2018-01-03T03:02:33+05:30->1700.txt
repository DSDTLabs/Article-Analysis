NEW DELHI: Aiming to increase milk consumption and, in turn, boost the income of dairy farmers, the agriculture ministry has written to all states to include milk in the   (MDM) scheme. It has even asked the department of food and public distribution to consider milk’s inclusion in the public distribution system. 

 “The   was also requested to include milk in the   through the anganwadi scheme,” said an official. 
 
 The efforts are part of the ministry’s overall plan to increase milk production to 255 million tonnes by 2022 so as to double the farmers’ income through the allied activity of dairy farming. 
 
 The ministry had reviewed its measures to achieve the target at a special meeting last month where it was decided that the total share of milk procurement by cooperatives was to be increased from the existing 10% to 20% of milk production by 2022.
