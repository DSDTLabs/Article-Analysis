MUMBAI: Residents of  , in  , staged a token ‘Chipko Andolan’ on Tuesday to protect the large trees expected to be uprooted for the construction of Metro III, an underground train line between Colaba and Seepz (Andheri) via Bandra.

 Those facing the dagger include a huge banyan, which, residents of the neighbourhood say, could be over a century old. Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, the theatre personality best known for her Indian production of Vagina Monologues, on Tuesday took to social media. “The   tree just below my house at Churchgate, J. N. Tata road is to be cut.
 
 Someone please help prevent that......since I was 6 years old I used to sit under that tree and wait for the school bus........it was said at that time, that it was over 100 years old then,” she posted on Facebook. Soon, her Facebook page was flooded with messages from citizens and activists.
 
 An RTI query by activist Zoru Bathena revealed that 98 trees are set to be affected—some will be cut and others transplanted—for the construction of the Churchgate Metro station. The trees will be transplanted in Aarey Colony, Mahul and Mysore colony near the monorail station. 
 
 Mody-Kotwal told TOI she wants to launch a Chipko movement kind of protest if required. “I remember waiting under the banayan for the school bus in the 1950s. Besides most of our buildings today are so old that we are worried their foundation would be impacted if they carry out heavy works and cut trees.” 
 
 Lolita Shivdasani, another resident of the area since 1985, expressed concern that the topography of Churchgate would change. “We will not give up and try to save as many every trees as possible,” said Shivdasani who lives in Lotus Court. 
 
 Activist Neera Punj, who lives in the area, said, “We are in a century where we can live in harmony with environment by using the best technology. This is definitely not difficult for a state with rich coffers.”
