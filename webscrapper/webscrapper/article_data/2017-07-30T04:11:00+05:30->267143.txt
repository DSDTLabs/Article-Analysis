NEW DELHI: The Centre plans to start as many as five residential schools in every state to cater to Dalit girls, but on the condition that states take over their   and functioning after three years.

 As per the proposal with the social justice ministry, the government will open boarding schools dedicated to Dalit girls in  . 
 
 The targeted bid to boost education levels follows the evidence that the worst hit in the educationally-deficient blocks are the socially weak communities, especially their girl child. The proposal is that five schools will be opened in five districts with largest   population in the state. 
 
 The schools will provide education from Class VI to Class XII. Boarding schools are seen as the best way to draw children, especially girls, in remote places. 
 
 The facilities for lodging and food besides schooling expenses incentivises education among the poor whose living conditions divert young girls towards household chores.
 
 In the proposed schools, 70% seats will be reserved for SC girls and the rest would be open to other categories like general classes and the OBCs.
 
 The admissions will be open to girls whose parents have an annual income of less than Rs 2.50 lakh.
 
 However, states will have to undertake serious responsibilities to be eligible for the school scheme for Dalit girls. 
 
 The Centre is likely to insist that beneficiary states take over complete ownership of the initiative after first three years. 
 
 Initially, the states will have to provide 15-20 acres of land. Sources said the Centre will provide an assistance of Rs 12 crore for school complex and hostels.
 
 In case of hill areas and deserts, the assistance will go up to Rs 16 crore. But the states will bear any additional cost above central assistance.
