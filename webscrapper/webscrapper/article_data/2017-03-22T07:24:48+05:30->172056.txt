BANDEL: A gang of three killed a railway hawker in   shortly after midnight on Monday. The gang members knocked on the victim's door claiming that they were police. 

  When victim Swarup Banik's wife Mitali opened the door, they barged in pointing revolvers at them. One held a gun at her head, another pointed his firearm at the couple's daughter Dipti. The third shot at 31-year-old Swarup from a point blank range. 
 
 While the gangsters fled, neighbours in Swarup's Swaraj Pally locality informed the cops. Police reached the spot from Bandel outpost and took the victim to  , where doctors declared him dead on arrival.
 
 Hooghly SP Sukesh Jain said, "We suspect the killers had an old rivalry with Swarup. No one has been arrested so far." Cops, however, said Swarup did not have any past criminal record.
