NASHIK: The   is having a tough time in finalising its list of candidates for the   as it is suffering from the problem of plenty.

 The BJP will go alone in the   (NMC) elections for the second consecutive time and was way ahead, compared to other parties, in terms of conducting interviews of the candidates.
 
 The final list was to be declared on January 23, but was postponed to January 28. However, according to sources, the party is still deciding on their candidates.
 
 “The party is flooded with demands from candidates wanting to contest elections on BJP ticket. The party interviewed nearly 700 candidates for 122 seats. It was a humongous task and everybody wanted to try their skills in reaching out to people and be a corporator. The decision to finalise the names has been postponed as the party is undecided on candidature in several constituencies,” a senior BJP functionary said.
 
 There is a tough fight for candidature in prabhags like Indira Nagar, Panchavati, CIDCO, Gangapur Road, Bhabha Nagar, among others. “These wards are either related to sitting members of legislative assembly (MLAs) or corporators, who have recently joined the party, or someone related to BJPs MLAs in rural areas,” another senior functionary said.
 
 The party is likely to release the list of its first set of candidates in next couple of days and the final list is likely to be declared on February 1 as February 3 is the last date for filing nominations.
 
 “The party will split the list and declare the candidature for less controversial seats first. In case of controversial seats, the party is likely to declare the seats on Feb 1 so the disgruntled candidates are less likely get any seat in other parties,” said the party official.
