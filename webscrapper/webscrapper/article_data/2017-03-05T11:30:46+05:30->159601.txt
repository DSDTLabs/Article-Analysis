VISAKHAPATNAM: No discipline can thrive unless there is well-coordinated effort to fuse research and research methodologies from all connected fields into it, said   vice-chancellor  . 

 Speaking at the valedictory of the workshop on ‘Recent Trends in Chemical Specifications, Kinetics and Nano Materials’ at AU on Saturday, the VC said this workshop could trigger fusion research in three different fields with results that could cater to environment, food security and ecology protection.
 
 Registrar professor   said fusion research in these three fields could trigger a green revolution that would provide food security and help protect the environment. He said kinetics involves mathematics and statistics, which would help research in those two fields.
