KOLHAPUR:   are synonyms with rains. But this year, the Kolhapur zone of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) claims that it is all   the upcoming monsoons in full action.

 The Kolhapur zone has formed a war room at its zonal office with skilled workforce and enough number of transformers for replacements in case of any emergency.
 
 MSEDCL has over 18 lakh residential and commercial consumers across the district. Flood like situation is the usual scene during the monsoon season. After the pre-monsoon calamity reflecting the poor management of MSEDCL across the district, they want to avoid a similar situation again.
 
 Chief Engineer of Kolhapur zone M   said, “We are committed to supply uninterrupted electricity to our customers. We have deployed two skilled employees in the district disaster management department at the collector’s office. They will make sure that no one suffers power cuts across the district.”
 
 “We have set up a control room in the zonal office to maintain a proper coordination among our officials located in various places of the district. We aim for uninterrupted electricity supply in the rural areas. Tenders regarding the maintenance of the power supplying lines, transformers have already been floated. Strict action will be taken against employees who fail to discharge their duty,” he said.
 
 He added, “We have developed an internal communication system with all section offices. There are 314 section officers in two districts. We have developed an internal communication system through which an officer sitting in any of the two zones will get all information related to power supply in no time.”
