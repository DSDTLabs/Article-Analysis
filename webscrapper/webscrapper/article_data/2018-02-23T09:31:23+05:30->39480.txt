BHOPAL: With 48 hours to go for the bypolls, cash-for-vote allegations heightened political tension on Thursday evening, with   accusing the   Congress candidate of distributing money to voters and   alleging that its   candidate was beaten and bloodied by police. 

 Workers of both parties clashed in Kolaras after campaigning ended on Thursday, forcing police to use force. Congress candidate Mahendra Yadav suffered head injuries in the violence. Section 144 has been imposed in a few areas of Khatora town.
 
  CM   met with DGP R K Shukla late at night to discuss the situation. 
 
 Just before violence broke out in Kolaras, BJP had filed a complaint with Election Commission, accusing Mungaoli Congress candidate Brijendra Singh Yadav of distributing money to voters. BJP leaders posted a photo on social networking sites, alleging that a Congressman was handing out money to an elderly woman while Yadav bowed to touch her feet. Congress denied the charges, and alleged that the photo was morphed.
 
 Around the same time in Kolaras, a group of congress workers stopped a car belonging to BJP MLA from Bhind, Narendra Singh Kushwah, alleging that he was carrying Rs 50 crore to be distributed to lure voters.
 
 When police searched the car, no cash was found. Congress candidate Mahendra Yadav then claimed there was Rs 5 crore in vehicle. "We informed Shivpuri SP that the BJP MLA was distributing cash in the area. Police did not check the vehicle and instead helped Kushwah escape," Yadav told reporters.
