GURUGRAM: The Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has decided to install   devices in vehicles used to pick up garbage from households for better implementation of waste management plans across the city.

 The civic body has partnered with Ecogreen Energy Pvt Ltd to set up a   to monitor the garbage pick-up vehicles.
 
 “The control room will constantly monitor the movement of these vehicles so that if they stray from their route or do not go for pick-up, they can be alerted,” said an Ecogreen official.
 
 The official said the vehicles would sound a bell whenever they enter a specified area to alert residents. The vehicles will also be equipped with microphones to make announcements.
 
 Currently, the agency has a call centre at its office on Sohna Road that addresses people’s grievances. An app is also being designed to help the residents track the time of the arrival of the vehicles.
 
 The Gurgaon municipal corporation is also said to be planning to set up a project monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of its waste management project. The monitoring unit will have one person each from the Gurgaon and Faridabad municipal corporations along with an expert on solid waste management.
 
 Gurgaon residents have time and again objected to the civic body’s waste management plans. Recently, a group of residents from DLF Phase 1 had moved the   against a proposed waste transfer station in the area
