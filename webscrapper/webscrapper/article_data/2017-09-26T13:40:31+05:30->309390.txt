AGRA:   (AMU) authorities were forced to appoint a new provost for Sir Syed North Hall on Monday after students staged a protest on Sunday night by banging plates and spoons at the vice chancellor’s lodge to protest against the “poor” quality of food being served in the hostel.
 
  According to students’ leader Imran Khan, the cost of dining has been increased by Rs 100 per student, from Rs 1,000 in the last academic session to Rs 1,100 this year, but the quality of food has gone from bad to worse. “We had complained many times regarding the poor quality of food, but no one paid heed to our requests,” he said.
  
  “We were helpless. So, we had to protest on Sunday in front of the VC lodge with ‘roti and dal’ served to us to show him the quality of food we ate every day and demanded the removal of the provost,” Imran said.
  
  When contacted, registrar of the university, Prof  , said that the new provost,  , is a professor in computer science department. He said the outgoing provost, Azhar Jameel, has not been keeping well for some time and that could be the reason for some laxity in food quality.
  
  He admitted that the bills for dining have increased due to escalating cost of food items, but “the administration is making efforts to maintain quality”.
  
  Earlier in March, with meat going off the menu in all messes of the varsity hostels, following the UP government’s crackdown on “illegal” abattoirs, students had written to the vice-chancellor seeking his intervention. The issue also took a political colour when All India   (AIMIM) leader   tweeted about their plight. “15000 students in Aligarh Muslim University have not been served meat (buffalo) since 26 March and BJP says we are not targeting?” he had tweeted.
