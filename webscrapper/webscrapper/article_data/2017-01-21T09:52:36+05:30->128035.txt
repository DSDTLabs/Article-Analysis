 He later met ZP’s chief executive officer   and lodged a complaint about the irregularities in welfare distribution. Deshmukh also demanded disciplinary action against the block development officer of Narkhed who is tasked with the implementation of the scheme through respective panchayat samitis.
 
 However, a ZP official claimed that there was no irregularity in the scheme and only a confusion. “As per a government order dated December 5, the scheme has been altered.

That process is on and probably the complainants are not aware of this change,” the official said.
