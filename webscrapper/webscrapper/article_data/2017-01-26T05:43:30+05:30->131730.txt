MUMBAI: A 39-year-old man was arrested for beating a stray dog to death with bamboo sticks inside a housing complex in   (west). The arrested man,  , who works at a construction site, and his co-workers were captured on CCTV cameras hitting the dog.

 The police said that the incident took place last Wednesday and Bagwat was arrested on Monday for mischief by killing or maiming cattle and under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.
 
 Bagwat told the police the dog had bitten him and hence, he and his co-workers beat it up. Activists said they could not spot any bite mark on the body of the accused. Bagwat was remanded in judicial custody.
 
 “There were many people who witnessed the crime. I urge citizens to at least call the police if they witness a crime. This can act as a deterrent against those who feel they can get away with murder,“ said Goregaon-based animal activist  .
 
 “Even if a stray barks or bites, it does not give us a licence to kill it. People can report such animals to the municipal authorities and a sterilization drive can be arranged,“ said an animal rights NGO member. Activists will form a human chain at   on Thursday to raise the issue of cruelty on animals.
