HYDERABAD: To ensure that the construction of at least two lakh 2-BHK houses are completed before the bugle is blown for the 2019 polls, chief minister   has decided to consider increasing the cost of construction per unit fixed by the government.

 
  
  
 
 According to sources, KCR has asked housing minister   to convene ameeting of the   and suggest recommendations on the escalation of cost of material for the construction.
 
 The scheme had come to a standstill after contractors stopped construction activity following a steep hike in cement and steel prices. While the price of steel rose from Rs 32,000 to Rs 54,000 per tonne in the last two years, cement prices have gone up from Rs 230 per bag to over Rs 350 in the last two years.
 
 However, the construction cost of the 2-BHK units fixed by the government — Rs 5.04 lakh per unit in rural areas, Rs 5.3 lakh per unit in municipalities or urban areas and Rs 7.9 lakh per unit in   area — has remained unchanged.
 
 Despite steel and cement manufacturers agreeing to supply at lesser rates compared to market rates after the ministers’ committee, that includes  , held a meeting with them, the prices have been going up constantly.
 
 When contacted, Indrakaran Reddy told 
  that they would soon convene a meeting of engineers and officials concerned to discuss the prices to be fixed for supply of cement, steel and other construction material. “We will submit the report on how much cost needs to be fixed for supply of steel, cement and other construction material vis-a-vis the prevailing market values. CM KCR will take a final call,” he said, and exuded confidence that the target will be met before 2019 polls.
