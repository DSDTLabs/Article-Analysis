MARGAO: South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar on Thursday demanded   president   immediately tender an apology following the Supreme Court’s dismissal of the PIL regarding Justice B H Loya’s death.

 Pointing out that the Supreme Court observed it was a natural death and no independent inquiry was required, Sawaikar said, “The court also observed that it is the misuse of PIL for personal agenda. Congress did everything to malign the image of   national president   over the years. Congress had even taken a delegation to the President. Today they stand exposed badly. As Congress cannot defeat BJP, it has resorted to worst tactics which have repelled on them by this judgement. Congress president Rahul Gandhi should immediately tender his apology.”
