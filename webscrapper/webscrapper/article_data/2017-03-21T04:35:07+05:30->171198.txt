NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to launch this week a mobile application to help people pay   and link their   online. 

  additional commissioner Ram Mohan Singh said since last December, the civic body had distributed unique   identification code (UPIC) cards to 3.30 lakh taxpayers who had filed their return online. It will also cover 40,000 people who have paid the tax manually. 
 
 The taxpayers will now have direct access to their digitised records and will be able to upload their documents, which will be vetted by the civic body. The UPIC card has a QR code, which will link the user’s property record files.
 
 “Taxpayers who have received their UPIC card can link their records online from the SDMC website. About 13,000 taxpayers have already done that and we will set up camps to sensitise people about the procedure,” said Singh.
 
 On the website, a button for ‘link your property tax receipts’ will take the user to a page where they will either have to use the UPIC card number or the property ID to fill up the details about their tax payments. “We have uploaded the records available with us and if any details are missing, taxpayers can do it themselves sitting at home,” he added.
 
 The UPIC card is essential for the taxpayers as soon the entire record will become digital. Singh said people who hadn’t got the card yet should inform their nearest zonal offices.
 
 The officer said last year’s amnesty scheme had helped the corporation collect more property tax — Rs 900 crore against the target of Rs 700 crore. In the next 10 days, it expects to earn another Rs 100 crore.
