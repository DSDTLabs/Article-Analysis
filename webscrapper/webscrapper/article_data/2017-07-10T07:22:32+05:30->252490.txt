AHMEDABAD: Vinay Oza (name changed), an engineering student, believed that he could never live without  . Over the years, he tried all imaginable natural and synthetic psychotropic substances. 

 “One fine day, I woke up to the realization of how I was ruining my life and how it was affecting my family and friends. Leaving that life was not easy but with the support of well-wishers and counsellors at   de-addiction centre, I found a new life,” he said, in front of over 1,000 people at   riverfront on Sunday morning.
 
 Oza was among the four youths who decided to come and share their life’s stories. They had fallen into bad company and believed that taking drugs was part of ‘being cool’. But after some time, they realized that that road of drugs led to nowhere. These youths are also reaching out to other addicts and helping them shun drugs.
 
 Bike-a-Thon: Ride for a  , organized by the zonal unit of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Wajra-o-Force, and other organizations, saw participation by around 1,000 bikers and 200 other volunteers who started from the Sabarmati riverfront behind NID at 7 am on Sunday and ended the event at 10 am. City mayor Gautam Shah and Hari Om Gandhi, zonal director, NCB, had flagged off the event.
 
 Gandhi said that the purpose of the initiative was to create positive peer pressure. “We are already working on the drug menace from the supply side by nabbing the carriers and suppliers. But we also want to curb the demand side by creating awareness about the ill-effects of contraband. Hence, fortnight-long activities were planned to spread awareness,” he said. 
 
 Gandhi further said that the Healthy Campus initiative of the NCB and various colleges are already promoting healthy living on and off campuses.
 
 During the fortnight, volunteers had reached out to more than 50,000 individuals through seminars, campus visits, road shows and pledge ceremonies.
