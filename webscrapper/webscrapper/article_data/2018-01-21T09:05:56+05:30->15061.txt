LUCKNOW: A leading national bank having a large number of ATMs in the city saw many of them run dry due to cash supply shortage from RBI. The trend was observed earlier too with most people flocking to ATMs only to return empty-handed. 

 Anita Shrivastava, a homemaker in  , said, "I needed to withdraw money urgently to pay my child's school fees but couldn't find a single working   of the bank in my area. I had to borrow cash from my neighbour." 
 
 There was a long queue in front of one such ATM in Indiranagar too. The crowd started shouting when the machine stopped working all of a sudden. A bank official said the ATMs are not getting adequate currency from RBI, so they dry up soon.
 
 Shortage of cash was also seen at ATMs in Janakipuram, Aliganj, Niralanagar and Gomtinagar. Nikita Bajpayee, a private employee said, "On one hand, the banks charge us if transactions exceed the standard number. On the other, they force us to do multiple transactions when ATMs run dry often."
