HYDERABAD: After a car driven by an engineering student rammed into a pavement, killing cobbler T   at   on Monday, the management of the bar where the girl partied claimed she and her friends had provided ID proof. 

 Buchi Reddy, the managing director of Up   at AS  , said, "The girls showed scanned ID proofs on their mobile phones, which showed they all were above 21 years."   felt they had "tampered with the scanned ID proofs".
 
 In CCTV footage provided by the Lounge, the four girls can be seen entering the lounge at 8.44pm and showing their ID proof on their mobiles.
 
 "As per rules, we are supposed to check ID cards or the scanned copy. But there is no equipment by which we can verify whether the ID cards people show are fake or original," said Reddy.
 
 The Lounge said only two of the four girls had liquor, while two male friends joined them. They left around 12am. While police say  , the driver, was not drunk. 
 
 Lounge has been booked under sec 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC for serving liquor to two people below 21. The Lounge management said it opened two months ago, but has been shut by excise department.
