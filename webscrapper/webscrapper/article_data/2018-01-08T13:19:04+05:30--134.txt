NEW DELHI: Hello and welcome all to Day 4 of our 1st India-South Africa Test coverage. 

 Intermittent rain came in the way of what promised to be an absorbing day of Test cricket, forcing a washout of the third day's play in the series opener.
 
 No play was possible in the morning or post-lunch sessions.
 
 There will be 98 overs bowled on days four and five with bright sunshine predicted for the remainder of the game.
 
 Despite the loss of an entire day, a result is still very much possible in this match.
