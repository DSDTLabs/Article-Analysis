LUCKNOW: The grit and fighting prowess of   steered   past   4-3 in an engrossing   tie here on Tuesday.

 With the scores level 3-3 after the fourth match at the BBD Badminton Academy, Hendra Setiawan and Tang Chun Man finally won the men’s doubles against Kidambi Nandgopal and Lee Chun Hei Reginald to clinch the issue for the home side. The win now takes the Warriors on top of the points table.
 
 Earlier, it looked curtains for Kashyap in his Trump match, down 10-14 against Sourabh Verma in the deciding game after both had traded a game each.
 
 But the 31-year-old displayed his mettle and fighting prowess to inch back to 14-all and finally Verma cracked during the golden point to put the shuttle into the net much to the joy of the packed house. Kashyap, who has now won all his three matches in the tournament, didn’t start well as his rival cashed on the unforced errors to win the opening game on a trot.
 
 The home player then tightened up his defence and went for long rallies and importantly, kept Verma away from the net to rattle him and equalize things.
 
 That win provided the Warriors a 3-0 lead, and then K Srikanth had the chance to finish off things against HS Prannoy and provide the local side an unbeatable 4-0 lead. But the Ahmedabad skipper continued his splendid run in the tournament against an off-colour world No. 3 Srikanth to win easily.
 
 This was the 10th consecutive victory for him in the League. Then, Tai Tzu-Ying of Taiwan equalized the scores overcoming Saina Nehwal, ranked 10 in the world.
