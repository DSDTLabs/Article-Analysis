NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has prescribed a new antidote to tame  : compel   to spend time in   of   to make them understand the consequences of their actions.

 Alarmed over the high number of   and blatant  , the panel has agreed with the proposed provision of mandatory community service for offenders.
 
 Learning from best practices, this norm and undergoing refresher training have been included in the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill. In early 2000, Delhi police used to screen films on traffic laws, which violators had to see mandatorily, besides paying fine.
 
 Taking note of how traffic police slap charges whimsically for jumping traffic lights and lanes, it has asked government to define these provisions clearly. 
 
 To bolster its point, the panel has cited how commuters can be booked even in cases where traffic signals are malfunctioning or when some other road users’ are at fault. “The committee recommends that before applying law, technical things like signals, signage, stop-signs, divider etc. may be placed correctly. Proper training to police officials is also essential,” it has said. 
 
 Keeping in view that drivers of commercial vehicles usually spend the maximum time behind the wheel, the panel has suggested strict implementation of duty hours and prohibition of driving of commercial vehicles from 3am to 5am. 
 
 It has also recommended providing insurance cover to drivers and helpers, besides mandatory deployment of two drivers in vehicles travelling more than 500 kms a day. 
 
 The panel noted that while the speed limit and design speed of roads is up to 80 kmph and 120 kmph respectively, vehicles have provisions to reach up to speeds of 180 kmph or 240 kmph. “These vehicles act like a missiles or rockets if involved in an accident,” the panel said while recommending the government formulate laws to limit the acceleration capability.
