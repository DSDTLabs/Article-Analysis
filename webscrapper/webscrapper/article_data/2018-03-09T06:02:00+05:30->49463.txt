Palashipara (Nadia): Gloom descended on Panchdara village in Nadia’s Palashipara on Thursday when   jawan Abhijit Mondal (27) returned home in a coffin. 

 Abhijit, a jawan in 28 Rajput regiment, died and three other Army jawans were injured when three IEDs planted by militants exploded in quick succession during a patrol in Manipur’s Bongjoi village along the Myanmar border on Tuesday. 
 
 The family received the news late on Wednesday. Abhijit’s father Hiren said: “I was working in the field on Wednesday morning, when I got a phone call from a man speaking in Hindi, which I can’t understand. But I felt it was from Abhijit’s work station. As I tried to say I don’t know Hindi, the caller hung up. After a while, my phone rang again. I asked them to call around 2.30pm when my elder daughter-in-law, who knows Hindi, could speak. We came to know only on Wednesday afternoon that my son was no more.”
 
 Abhijit’s widow Aninjita said: “He was killed when IEDs exploded when he was on patrol with his regiment.” Abhijit’s elder brother, too, is in the Army. Abhijit had joined the Army in 2012 and married Aninjita on December 3 last year. 
 
 The Mondals and their neighbours wailed and screamed as the coffin arrived. While Hiren sat with a blank look, his wife Pratima, Aninjita and other family members cried inconsolably. 
 
 Neighbours lined up in the lanes of the village leading to the Mondals’ home, discussing how Abhijit died. Some tried comforting the family. A senior citizen said: “Though every death is painful, we are proud that a youth of our village has sacrificed his life for his motherland.”
 
 The body reached Kolkata airport on Thursday afternoon. Armymen accompanied the coffin to Abhijit’s village. He was given a guard of honour. After about an hour at home, the body was taken to the burning ghat.
