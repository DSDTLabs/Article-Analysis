PUNE: The forest department is all set to form a joint committee for taking up the maintenance work of Baner and Pashan hills. 

 It will also commission a cement wall to protect the forest cover on the hills.
 
 The urban forest management group will be headed by deputy conservator of forest Satyajeet Gujar. Citizens and the area corporator will join in to assist round-the-clock surveillance of the hills and better management of its green cover.
 
 Gujar announced the formation of the group during a meeting held with residents and environment activists of the area on Thursday. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for April 22.
 
 The residents of Baner and Pashan areas had approached Gujar to seek his intervention to prevent rampant cutting of trees on the hills for firewood by unidentified people, besides the regular forest fires and land misuse. Residents and committee members of the Baner Pashan Link Road   and environment conscious group   were a part of the meeting.
 
  of Vikas Samitee said, “We have been regularly raising the issue of land misuse and tree cutting on the hills. Thankfully, the fire department has been actively responding to our complaints about forest fires on the hills. What we need is a permanent way to prevent miscreants from entering the area. We are hopeful that the forest department will resolve this issue like it has for the hills in Sinhagad, Parvati and Warje areas.”
 
 Outlining the action plan for the new committee, Gujar said, “We are looking at preparing a self-sustained plan to protect the forest cover on the Baner and Pashan hills. Currently, it is difficult to manage with a limited manpower because the area is open to all. This is why we plan to involve more citizens for conservation activities. We hope to commission the wall in the new financial year which would cover almost 44 hectares of forest land. In the future, we can levy an entry fee and deploy 24x7 guards around the hills.”
