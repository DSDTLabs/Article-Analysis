NEW DELHI: A 37-year-old man was   in a park in   on Friday evening. Bhagat Singh’s throat was   with a sharp weapon and his face was   with a heavy rock so that his identity could be hidden. 

 Locals informed the police about a man’s body lying in the middle of a park, soon after which a team reached the spot and rushed Singh to the hospital where he was declared brought dead. Cops said that the accused is still absconding.
 
 The victim’s mobile phone was found in his possession, through which cops informed the family members about the incident. Singh lived with his wife and children at a rented house in the area and worked as an operator at a printing press. “We suspect this to be a case of personal enmity and are scanning the CCTV footage from the area to ascertain the sequence of events,” said a senior police officer.
