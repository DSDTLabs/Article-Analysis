LUCKNOW: With   Rail Corporation aiming to begin Metro   station construction by June this year, people of Lucknow should hopefully be able to board the Metro to Chaudhary Charan Singh (Amausi) airport from January  .

  has floated tender for design and construction of airport station which requires the contractor to build station in 30 months. So, if the work begins in June 2017, it should be completed by December 2019, allowing the public access by 2020, a year after the start of the entire North-South corridor from Munshipulia to Amausi station. The airport station would be the last halt on this corridor. 
 
 The airport station will be built underground. It will have two entrance corridors leading to both terminals -- international (T1) and domestic (T2). At both entrances, passengers would have to go downstairs to reach the concourse level of the underground station. This would have amenities like the waiting area, lounge, cafeteria, shops, bookstore and eateries for passengers waiting for their flight.
 
 The station would be built on 5,000 square metre area and will be connected to a 450-metre long ramp, coming from Kanpur Road. The elevated corridor on Kanpur Road would lower after   station and take a turn towards Metro’s casting yard. This ramp, inside the yard, will run parallel to the approach road leading to the airport’s international terminal. After a distance of about 100 metres, the ramp will go underground and connect to the 250-metre long station. A senior LMRC official said, “Since airport passengers come with heavy luggage we would install lifts of higher capacity. Also, we are considering to tie-up with Airport Authority of India’s trolley facility to shuttle passengers between the Metro station and airport conveniently.” Metro platform will be at the second basement level of underground station. People can climb down through stairs or escalators to reach the metro train.
