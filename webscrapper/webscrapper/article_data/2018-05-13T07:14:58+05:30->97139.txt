TIRUVANNAMALAI: Residents of   and neighbouring villagers were “determined to kill the victims” of Wednesday’s lynching and “burn their bodies”, according to a police officer. Wednesday’s horror had claimed the life of a 65-year-old woman.

 
 Recollecting the horrifying incident that stretched for 90 minutes, a police officer said the villagers had presumed that the five, who came in the car to offer prayers at their family temple, were child lifters.
 
 “They wanted to kill them on the spot. They even questioned us for trying to stop them and for rescuing the victims. They were not in a mood to listen to our repeated pleas,” a police officer, who was part of the four-member team that reached the spot, told TOI.
 
 Sub-inspectors Dhayalan and  , head constable   and special branch constable   reached the spot around 10.20am. However, they were outnumbered.
 
  (around 2km from Athimur) allegedly made a phone call and informed the villagers that the ‘child lifters’ were trying to escape in a ‘red’ car heading towards Athimur. Nearly 150 men prevented the victims’ car from moving ahead by pulling a repair trolley in the middle of the   at Athimur-Kaliyam Junction. They then pulled the victims out of the car, disrobed them and beat them black and blue. The attack continued for over an hour in the presence of the police team.
 
 At one point a police official stood on the police jeep and pleaded the villagers with folded hands to stop the attack. “As my persuasion failed to bear fruit, I climbed atop the police jeep and pleaded them to stop,” he said.
 
 The villagers ignored the cop’s plea and an SI quoted one of them as saying: “Don’t stop us. We will kill them and burn their bodies.” Many others also echoed the same view, the SI said.
