AMRITSAR: Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) has sought a time-bound probe by the special investigation team ( ) assigned to reinvestigate 186 cases related to 1984 anti-Sikh riots.   president Paramjit Singh   told TOI on Thursday that over the last three decades, at least 12 inquiry commissions and committees had looked into the 1984 massacre.

 “But no perpetrator has been brought to justice ever,” he said. On Wednesday, the   had referred these cases to a new SIT headed by a retired high court judge. He said as early as February 2015, the Narendra Modi-led NDA government had constituted a three-member SIT to reinvestigate criminal cases in connection with the 1984 massacre of Sikhs in Delhi. “This SIT closed 241 cases and filed charges in just 12,” he said.
 
 “It’s a welcome move to appoint a new SIT, but if this investigation is not given any timeframe to execute the job conclusively, it might linger on forever without result,” he said.
 
 Sarna said the alleged failure of the previous SITs had raised serious questions about whether authorities were genuinely committed to delivering justice to the victims and survivors of 1984 or not.
