Nagpur: Maharashtra government would be conducting a Common Eligibility Test ( ) for teachers before they could join any school. A statement in this regard was made before the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday, after which the court adjourned the hearing till July 19.

 The government’s submission came while hearing a suo motu PIL about massive irregularities and malpractices allegedly committed by school managements while recruiting teachers where the candidates are appointed on basis of their bribe paying capacity, instead of merit. The court appointed Anand Parchure as amicus curiae to draft the petition.
 
 According to the government, the CET would test general aptitude and IQ level of the aspirants on whether they could take up teacher’s job. It stated a resolution (GR) in this regard was issued on June 23. A software ‘Pavitra’ was also launched for publishing information regarding recruitments according to subjects, category and media. It was made mandatory for Shikshak Bharti to publish advertisements on this portal.
 
 On another government portal named ‘Saral’, the schools were told to post their registered list of admitted students and teachers. Accordingly, additional teachers would be adjusted in other schools before commencement of new academic session. 
 
 During last hearing, the government informed it would be shortly coming out with a policy to regulate teachers’   in government-aided private schools and may set up an authority on lines of MPSC to appoint them after going through a written test and interview. An amendment would be made in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (MEPS) Rules, 1981, and the government had already started preparations in this regard.
