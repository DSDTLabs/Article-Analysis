HYDERABAD: By hiding it inside his vest, Ranveer Singh, an employee at New Delhi-based Kapoor Printing Press, brought out the 2016 Eamcet-II medical entrance paper and leaked it to students.   (CID) officials found that   had done it to earn Rs 2 lakh. The leaked paper had put thousands of students at a disadvantage and forced them to take the exam again last year. 

 The CID officials said Ranveer Singh could not be arrested as he had died in a road accident a month ago and his role in the leak case came to light during interrogation of  , who was arrested from Uttar Pradesh nearly a month ago. 
 
 When the investigators tried to verify   footage at the printing press about how Ranveer Singh actually laid his hands on the question paper, they found to their disadvantage that the recording facility had a back-up of only one month. “Actually, we got the complaint three months after the paper was leaked. So, it turned out to be a disadvantage to us as there was no footage available to verify,’’ a top CID official told STOI. 
 
 “It was during packing of question papers that Ranveer Singh clandestinely took both sets of the question papers on different days and took them out of the press by hiding it inside his vest. Though the press had security at the exit, he still managed to take it out,” the CID official added. 
 
 After taking the risk to leak the question paper, Ranveer did not get money as per his agreement with the other accused who leaked it to medical students. He would have got the money only after the Eamcet-2 results after the students made the promised payment to their respective agents. Ranveer had mastered the art of leaking question papers out of the printing press as he was involved in several cases.
