GUWAHATI: Former chief minister   said he is concerned about the direction peace talks are taking in the state. Interacting with the media on Sunday, Gogoi said it is very important that dialogue be resumed with rebel groups for stability in the region. 

 "Since the new government came into power, peace talks have not been taking place with various groups in the state or the region. It is not taking the direction it did when we brought terrorist activities under control. We want the government to start these discussions and help bring peace to the state," Gogoi said.
 
 In 2016, two major militant attacks killed at least 17, including three security personnel, in the state. While Ulfa-I and a few other groups claimed joint responsibility for the incident at Pengeri in  , another in   was suspected to have been carried by NDFB-S.
 
 Gogoi brought up two other burning issues - the citizenship crisis and demonetisation.
 
 "The people of the state voted them (BJP) to victory hoping that they would fulfil the promises made during election campaigns. They must now work towards freeing the state of illegal migrants and completing the NRC update," he said.
 
 Coming down hard on the currency ban, the firebrand Congress leader said the   government has failed to control the situation. "In these 50 days, they have changed the terms and conditions 62 times. What is this?" Gogoi said.
