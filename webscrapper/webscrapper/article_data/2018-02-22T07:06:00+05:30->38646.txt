Ludhiana: The board of directors (BOD) for Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) has kept the underground power cable project under Smart City Mission on hold yet again. The MC officials have been directed to identify those places where laying of underground electricity cables should be done at the earliest to avert repeated accidents.

 The undergrounding of cables was proposed at the cost of Rs 231 crore. The project will cover 1,000 acres. In the previous meeting of BODs, chairman Karan Avtar Singh had raised a question on this project and officials were advised to get this venture completed through Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd because it is their purview to lay the cables. On Wednesday, too, a meeting was conducted in Chandigarh and this time, the officials were asked to carry out the task only in areas where people are frequently complaining about short circuit or some incidents have occurred in the past. Sources revealed officials will locate those areas and prepare the report again. 
 
 Meanwhile, replacing the ordinary street lights with LED will begin soon after the end of MC elections because work order to the selected company will be issued after election code of conduct is over. The tenders for laying sewerage and water supply lines along with canal-based water supply project will also be floated after MC polls. The members also discussed Pakhowal Road railway over bridge, smart schools, development of Malhar Road into a smart stretch, road signage, cycle tracks in Focal Point, retrofitting of Sarabha Nagar market and mobile toilets.
 
 The deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal, one of BODs, said important projects are being reviewed and new projects were also discussed on Wednesday. He said, some projects which were discussed were approved by the executive committee, but a nod from BOD is also important.
