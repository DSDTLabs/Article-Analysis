BERHAMPUR: The   district administration has decided to strictly impose the ban on the use of polythene and plastic carry bags in and around   during the forthcoming   at Chhatrapur. The administration has also asked excise officials to ensure that the prohibition order on sale of liquor in the area is honoured during the times of the festival. 

 A coordination committee meeting of various departments, presided over by district collector  , was held on Thursday. 
 
 Thousands of people from far off places of the state and the neighboring   throng the 17th century  , located on the bank of river Rushikulya, about 35 km from here, for the Chaitra Mela. Visitors customarily climb 999 steps to reach temple, located about 709-feet above sea level. This year, ten privately operated buses will carry visitors up to the temple.
 
 Even though the district administration has been enforcing a ban on polythene and plastic at Tara Tarini, particularly during the time of the festival, for the last two years, the use of these pollution hazardous materials by devotees has only seemed to increase. "This time, the Mela which is scheduled to start from March 6, will see the strict enforcing of the rule," said a senior officer.
 
 Massive awareness drives will be undertaken among tourists and visitors, apart from local people. All the shops in the region will be asked to strictly follow the decision as well, the official added.
 
 "Last year we had announced that we also plan to make the fair liquor-free - something we plan on enforcing this year too," said Pramod Kumar Panda, secretary of the Tara Tarini Development Board.
 
 District authorities have also asked concerned officials to ensure smooth supply of electricity, water and maintenance of sanitation.
