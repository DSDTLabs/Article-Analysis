CHANDIGARH: An altercation over volleyball rules between two third cousins ended up in a shooting incident at   village in   area of  's   district on Sunday evening. 

 Sonu Singh (23) and 19-year-old   Singh, alias Happy, are third cousins as they belong to same clan and their grandfathers were first cousins. A fortnight ago, the two men had an altercation that had been resolved only after intervention of their family members.
 
 They had another vociferous argument during a local volleyball game in the village. Ashish and Sonu were playing a volleyball match in opposing teams and had an argument over a point and the rules of the game. An angry Ashish left the match and returned with an unlicensed weapon. He shot at Sonu who was playing volleyball. Sonu collapsed and Ashish managed to escape.
 
 Sonu was rushed to Jind's civil hospital and from there was transferred to   as his condition became critical. The police booked and arrested Ashish in an attempt to murder case registered against him at Pillukhera police station. Jind SP   said the weapon used by the accused was unlicensed, so a section of Arms Act has been added to the charges.
 
 "Instead of taking Sonu to Rohtak, his family took him to a private hospital in Sonipat. Soon after recording his statement, we registered the case. Accordingly, Ashish has been arrested. During interrogation, he confessed that he used an unlicensed weapon,"  , SHO of Pillukhera police station said.
