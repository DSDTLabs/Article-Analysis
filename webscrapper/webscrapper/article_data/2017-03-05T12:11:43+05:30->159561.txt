NAGPUR: As part of its continuing action post  , the income tax department on Saturday conducted statewide surveys on private contractors undertaking government work.

 The  , which covers Vidarbha and parts of Marathwada, has covered six contractors. Of these, four are from the city and one each from  . Surveys were conducted in Kolhapur, Thane, Ahmednagar, Sangli and Pune as well.
 
 Like last month’s against doctors, the survey on contractors is based on a number complaints received by the department. The complaints which mentioned of substandard implementation of government works also pointed towards underreporting of profits by the private contractors.
 
 The complaints highlighted that the contractors had bagged works by bidding at unusually below the reserve price. It was alleged that bids were low, but the profits were under-reported.
 
 There are reports that the expenses have been inflated or booked on fictitious heads to reduce profits. Explanations for some of the suspicious expenses recorded in the accounts are being sought.
 
 It has also been found that some of the contractors’ accounts are showing cash in hand but there is no physical cash to match it. This means there are chances that the cash has been spent but not recorded in order to save tax complications. Some times cash expenditure is not accounted to save tax for the party receiving funds. This leaves a cash balance in the books without any funds in hand.
 
 The inflated or fictitious expenses are expected to have been recorded to adjust cash transactions, which otherwise have not been disclosed, said sources.
 
 After the note ban, the income tax department has been targeting various sectors of businesses. Earlier, similar actions were taken against doctors and jewellers.
