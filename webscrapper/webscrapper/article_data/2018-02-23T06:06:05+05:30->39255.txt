KOLKATA: Expelled CPM MP   on Thursday flaunted his newly-acquired Independent MP status in the Rajya Sabha by endorsing the Mamata   government in Bengal.

 Banerjee took to Twitter to write, “Now I am an Independent Rajya Sabha Member from Bengal. Will continue to raise issues concerning development of my state and issues of the people. Bengal progressing very well under @MamataOfficial (the chief minister’s official Twitter handle).” He also lauded the chief minister for “always fighting for rights of the common people”. 
 
 Banerjee’s praise came after the chief minister came down heavily on the Centre’s move to slash interest rates in PF and PPF. The chief minister wrote, also in Twitter, “All are suffering. Provident Fund interest rates were 8.82% when this government came to power. Now cut to 8.55%. PPF rates also cut. Big burden.”
 
 Evidently, Banerjee’s remarks didn’t go unnoticed in   circles.
 
 Bengal has 15 Rajya Sabha MPs and Banerjee’s term in the Upper House lasts till 2020.
