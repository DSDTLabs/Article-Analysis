Madurai: There is strict regulation in issue related to the maintenance of auto stands, bus bays etc in the city, commissioner of police of Madurai, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal told the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday. He said this in his counter-affidavit to a case filed by the secretary of Madurai district mini bus owners association, A Mydeen Basha.

 The petitioner wanted a direction to the government to prohibit autos from picking up passengers near the bus stops and bus stands by alleging that many autos are picking up passengers from bus bays and also picking up more than 10 passengers at a time. 
 
 “In Madurai city, there are 1,911 autos in the police commissionerate area, where 113 auto stands are available. The specific traffic range as well as the law and order police personnel regulate the stands. Whenever and wherever any violation or nuisance is found taking place, police are taking care of it and dealt the same in accordance with law. There are no auto stands or parking place in the bus bays and 113 auto stands have been permitted away from the bus stops in the city,” the commissioner said.
 
 He also denied the petitioner’s contention that police were not taking action against the erring auto drivers. The police registered 1.56 lakh cases and collected Rs 2.14 crore fine for the offences including demanding excess fare, operating autos without meter, overload seat alteration and other offences during the period from 2015 to 2017, the commissioner said. 
 
 Following it, the division bench directed the government to provide details with regard to places of auto stands and adjourned the case to March 19.
