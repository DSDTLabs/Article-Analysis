AHMEDABAD: At the ‘Genes, Gene Editing and the New Biotechnology,’ seminar at the  , James Greenwood, president and CEO Biotechnology Innovation Organizations, said that if India joined the global   rights regime, the biotech industry would see a tidal wave of expansion.

 Pankaj Patel, chairman and managing director, Zydus Group, said that India has the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) compliance patent law. “The only challenge was enforcement. But after PM   taking over, the enforcement has become proper. We have full TRIPS compliance patent law. We, as a country, have supported that. We also know that India has many poor people who have to pay from their pockets. We cannot afford expensive medicines,” he said. “I would urge the government very strongly that we should have the right patent law. We respect patents of every country and companies and we would enforce the patents according to the provision of law in India. This is the way we will develop the environment of research and progress,” Patel said.
 
 Patel was reacting to Greenwood, who urged the government to join the global IP Right and that provisions of Indian patent law were preventing entrepreneurs and innovators from even entering the field of biotechnology. 
 
 Nobel laureate Randy Schekman said research journals bear the responsibility of papers published. One should not judge the research on the journal’s impact factor, as these journals are commercial publication. Citing a research paper on stem cells by a US investigator, he said that the paper was viewed 1.2 million times, but when the research was to be replicated in the laboratory, it could not be replicated. He these research journals should not be charging, as the research is conducted using tax payers’ money.
