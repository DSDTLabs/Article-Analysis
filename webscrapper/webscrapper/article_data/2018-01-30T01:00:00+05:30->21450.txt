Abhishek Awasthi, who replaced the late actor   in ' ', will tie the knot with   in Mumbai on February 6. The pre-wedding functions — haldi, mehendi and sangeet — will be held a day earlier, while the reception will take place in Abhishek’s hometown, Kanpur, later. In keeping with the trend, Abhishek and Ankita did a pre-wedding photo shoot recently. The actor himself zeroed in on the location and their attires. “It was quite a filmi shoot with a Greece-like set-up. The result is amazing,” he shares. 
Interestingly, ever since they exchanged rings on February 5 last year, Abhishek had locked February 6, 2018 as his wedding date. He says, “I’ve always wanted to get married a day after the first anniversary of my engagement. Also, we didn’t have a roka. Maine bas ladki ko rok kar rakha tha (laughs). I decided to get married in Mumbai as many of my industry friends would not be able to come to Kanpur. A reception will be held in Kanpur later for my relatives.”
 Abhishek, who is also known for his dancing talent, has designed a special performance for the wedding, in which he will be joined by his industry friends, including   and  . He says, “I am going to perform to ' ' (' '), as it’s my favourite song. I will also pull in Ankita to shake a leg with me.”
 Ankita, who just completed her graduation, aspires to be a chef and the groom-to-be has been encouraging her. “She will enroll in the course in April this year. I want her to become a chef as Ankita khaana kamaal ka banaati hai. My friends and I are big fans of her culinary skills. Meri paanchon ungliyaan ghee mein hai aur sar kadhaai mein,” he says. Planning the future is all fine, but what about their honeymoon? “We plan to go to Italy. However, we will have to postpone it by a couple of months as I will be shooting and we also have a close relative’s wedding to attend,”
