Vijayawada: A cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister KE Krishnamurthy approved the regularisation of illegal constructions on government lands spread across the city. 

 The sub-committee which organised a meeting at the assembly building here on Tuesday approved a few long-pending demands of denizens including permission for sale of houses in hilly areas.
 
 Krishnamurthy along with minister Atchannaidu, special chief secretary Manmohan Singh and CCLA commissioner Anil Chandra Punetha, Krishna district collector Lakshmikantham, municipal commissioner J Nivas, and legislators Bonda Umamaheswara Rao, Jaleel Khan participated in subcommittee meet and discuss the applications received for regularising constructions in assigned lands. Collector Lakshmikantham explained that there are around 10,000 illegal constructions in government lands across the city and without any objections and the sub-committee has agreed to regularise them soon.
 
 The sub-committee declined proposals of regularising 18,000 houses on the Krishna riverbed and canal bunds in the city considering the court judgments and directed the VMC commissioner Nivas to relocate the residents in other areas by constructing affordable houses.
