NEW DELHI: The first year and second year students at   have complained that all those involved in protests against the autonomy of the college have not been   by the  

 They claimed that they were also asked questions regarding their thoughts on the autonomy issue during the residence interview, a mandatory exercise conducted before the grant of a spot on campus hostels.
 
 According to the students, the residence list — released on Thursday — did not feature names of several students who had been granted spots in the hostel earlier on merit. “Students who have fewer marks than us, or have been far less active in college activities have their names in the list. Our names are not there because we were a part of the autonomy protests,” said a student, on condition of anonymity.
 
 The selection for residence is largely on the basis of merit, even though no set guidelines have been set by the administration. “This time though, the selection is highly arbitrary,” said another second year student.
 
 When asked for a comment on the issue raised by the students, the associate dean of residence refused to comment.
