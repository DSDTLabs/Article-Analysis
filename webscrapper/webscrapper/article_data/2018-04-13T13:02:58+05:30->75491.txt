KOZHIKODE:  , the differently- abled student of the Velimanna Government Mappila UP School, sat on a dharna before the district collectorate on Thursday for his basic right for education. His repeated requests to upgrade his school to a high school was turned down by the government. 

 Inaugurating the dharna, A P J M  , grand nephew of former president A P   and trustee of  , urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to upgrade the school to enable Asim continue his studies.
 
 "Mohammed Asim's demand is a genuine one. If APJ Abdul Kalam was alive he would have intervened on the issue as he believed that every child in the country had the right for education," Dawood said.
 
 Twelve-year old Asim, who was born without hands and has 90% disability, has completed his seventh standard from the Velimanna school which is just 250 metre away from his house.
 
 Asim said that he will have to stop his studies if the UP school is not upgraded to a high school as travelling 6 km to the lone aided high school in the panchayat was difficult for him.
 
 A large number of people from the village of Velimanna and Omassery panchayat, including students, took part in the dharna.
 
 Later Asim and office bearers of the action committee that was formed to raise the issue met district collector UV Jose.
 
 The district collector said that he would try his best to get the school upgraded.
