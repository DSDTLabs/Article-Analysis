KOLKATA : The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has decided to concretise bylanes of   blocks to give residents long-term relief from bumpy ride on broken roads. After the concrete overhaul, any agency that digs up the roads will have to concretise the dug-up portions. Else, they would fined.

 The civic authorities has allocated Rs 20 crore this year for concretisation. “Concretisation will ensure longevity of roads in the blocks. Elsewhere, the big roads will have a black top with a three-year warranty and the contractors would be responsible for maintenance,” said Salt Lake mayor Sabyasachi Dutta.
 
  
 Presently, the township has only one concrete stretch — the   that moves along Kendriya Vidyalaya II and the   campus.
 
 The work to concretise roads will start off with the damaged roads. The bylane moving into FD Block beside the   building is likely to be one of the first stretch to get concretised. According to civic sources, the initial cost of concretisation will be quite high (see box), but it will save the recurring patchwork and repair cost that the authorities now has to undertake every year. The authorities spent about Rs 1.2 crore for patchwork of roads in all the blocks of Salt Lake in the last financial year.
 
 “This would be an effective initiative. Having concrete roads would also ensure that many morning and evening walkers get a smooth surface to walk on,” said   secretary Kumar Shankar Sadhu.
 
 Besides, it has also been decided that any agency that digs up a certain stretch would have to repair the dug-up area by concretising it. “Previously, there was no specific rule for any agency and they did not have to take any permission for digging. Neither were they bound to repair the dug-up portion. But from now, they would have to inform the civic authorities and once they finish their work, they would have to concretise the stretch, else they would be fined,” said a civic official.
