 “Gatalus are idols of Mahankali decorated with colourful flowers. The devotees carry these idols from smaller temples and several homes to the   Temple on this day. A few days before the Bonalu, the temple sends out invites to smaller shrines around the city to participate in the revelry,” informs a devotee. The tradition of carrying Gatalu is one that is unique only to the   celebrations held at Lal Darwaza.
 
 Among the devotees dotting the street, one could also spot some dressed as Potharaju — the brother of Mahankali. With chests puffed out with pride, painted faces they were seen swaying to the beating of drums during the procession.

It’s their way of paying tribute to Mahankali,” said a devotee.
