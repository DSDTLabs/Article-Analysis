LUCKNOW: Aiming to bring down the huge pendency of over 15 lakh civil cases in UP, the state government has decided that   would work daily instead of just once a month. 

 UP law minister Brijesh   told   on Monday, "The district and session courts are already overburdened with cases and as new cases are filed, the numbers and pendency keep mounting. If Lok Adalats work daily, it will reduce pendency and ensure timely justice and relief to litigants."
 
 The government would be getting full-time judges appointed for the Lok Adalats which are proposed in 71 districts only for now. 
 
 "The government has approached the Allahabad high court for getting full-time judges appointed for the Lok Adalats which would work daily," Pathak said, while speaking to TOI. Presently, Lok Adalats work on a monthly basis.
 
 Giving details of the government's decision to set up 13 commercial courts in the state, Pathak said that the state government has even released an initial sum of Rs 1 crore to start the process.
 
 The 13 commercial courts are proposed in major towns. Since the government is seeking investments, it aims to ensure speedy resolution of all commercial disputes to boost the ease of doing business.
