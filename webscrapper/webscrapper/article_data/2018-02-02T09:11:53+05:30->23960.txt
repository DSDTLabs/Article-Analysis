PUNE: A 70-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday for raping a mentally challenged   in   in Pune district. The incident came to light around 10 days ago. But as the girl was not able to provide details about the suspect, it took the Pune rural police some time to crack the case.

 The probe revealed that the suspect used to   the girl on the pretext of offering her sweets. He has been charged under IPC Section 376 (rape) and sections of the   (POCSO) Act. An officer of Pune rural police told TOI the 16-year-old girl was mentally challenged and couldn't speak properly. Her parents are labourers, he added, and said they used to leave the girl alone at home to go to work. He said the girl's parents took her to a government hospital on January 22 as she was not feeling well. "They were shocked to find their daughter was two months' pregnant," the officer said. The parents then lodged a police complaint against an unidentified person. 
 
 The officer said a woman police officer met the girl daily to gain her confidence and get her to talk after which cops began to suspect her neighbour. The suspect was interrogated and finally admitted to having raped the girl when she was alone at home.
