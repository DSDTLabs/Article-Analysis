Surat: The work to convert the 3.86km stretch of Surat-Dumas Road from ONGC Circle to Surat airport into an iconic road is expected to begin in May. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has invited expressions of interest (EOIs) from private companies for this ambitious project designed in 2017.  The consultant appointed for the project has estimated its cost at Rs14 crore. SMC authorities are keen to have a road at the entrance of the city to give a grand impression about Surat, particularly to air passengers.  “SMC would not have normally thought of undertaking this project on PPP basis. However, as the decision to curtail expenditure was taken in January-February 2018, now SMC has no choice but to involve a private partner to develop this road,” said a civic officer from Athwa zone. “We will get royalty from the private partner and also share in advertisement revenue that will be generated on this stretch,” another civic officer said.  Landscaping, different themes at a distance of 500 metre, waterbodies, cycle tracks, footpaths, joggers track, decorative light poles, service track and bus stops have been envisioned for the road. A number of private players have shown willingness to enter into partnership with SMC for this project.
