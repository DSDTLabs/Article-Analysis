RANCHI:   may have played the most important knock of his fledging international career in making a splendid 104, but it far from guarantees a regular Test spot for him.

 For someone who has built his reputation as a big-hitter in limited-overs cricket, the 28-year-old Maxwell gave a fine demonstration of his ability to adapt his game to suit his team's needs. The right-hander didn't hit his first boundary until the 57th ball he faced and it took him as many as 95 to reach his maiden half-century with a six off  . It was easily his slowest knock, yet at no stage in his 191-run stand with Smith did Maxwell lag behind his captain in terms of his personal contribution.
 
 Maxwell, who was left holding the handle of his bat after it broke into two on the first ball of the day from  , was kept waiting in his nineties by India for a long time before he got to his hundred with an ungainly cut off Yadav to the third man fence. He later spoke of his love for the longest format. "I have spoken a lot about red-ball cricket. To be able to show that at Test level is something I am extremely proud of and I can finally show people with a result."
 
 To do that, he needs to be consistent. "Hopefully something ticks inside that I can be consistent. That's what selectors have always wanted. I hope I can continue batting long periods, building partnerships and secondly helping Australia to win."
 
 Maxwell, however, can take pride in the fact that he is now among a select band of 13 players in the world - and second Australian after   - who have scored centuries in all three formats of the game at the international level. Maxwell's 104 in Ranchi could turn out to be the starting point in his bid to reinvent himself as a Test batsman.
