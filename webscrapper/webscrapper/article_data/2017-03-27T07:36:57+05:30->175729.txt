CHANDIGARH:   have announced a series of rewards for inmates who showed “exemplary behaviour” during the rioting in the jail on Friday night.

 According to an official spokesperson, as a reward for protecting and saving the lives of four staff members during the rioting by about 150 inmates, the jail authorities have presented four barracks with TV sets, while giving a go-ahead for the establishment of a bakery unit for prisoners desirous of doing factory work.
 
 In another gesture, more than 25 prisoners, who had requested their transfer to other prisons for personal reasons had been shifted to jails of their choice/hometown. Further, nearly 48 cases of leave, pending with the DC office, had been given the sanction as a reward to inmates who did not join the mob, said the spokesperson.
 
 As the prison returned to normalcy after a successful and restrained operation by police and jail officials, the authorities got cracking on the task of introducing sweeping reforms in the prison, as directed by chief minister   on Saturday. The authorities arranged for a team of doctors to check inmate for any injuries and did not come across any. Even as the process of introducing long-term reforms started to set in, the jail authorities took several immediate steps on Sunday to reward the inmates who did not participate in Friday night’s violence but instead came to the help of the prison staff in various ways.
 
 A helpline is being launched in the DC office for expediting parole requests, while arrangements are being made to provide the prisoners with special facilities to meet their relatives for the whole next week. The barrack in which the trouble started will be converted into an activity centre, with computer, English, yoga and music classes set to commence next week, the spokesperson disclosed. Further, a special IGNOU enrolment drive has started in the prison, with 31 inmates responding to the prison officials’ encouragement to join various courses.
