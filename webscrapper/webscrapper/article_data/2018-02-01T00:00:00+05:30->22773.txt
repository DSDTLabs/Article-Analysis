Recently, Mrinalini  , who shot to fame with her dubsmash videos, took to her social media page to announce that she’s part of   Kumararaja’s  . She posted, “A   Film #superdeluxe” (sic) and put up a picture with the team.

 Ask her how she got the offer and   says, “One of   sir’s assistants had called me for a screen test. I was obviously both excited and nervous. But I was keen on giving it my best, irrespective of the outcome. I was given a narration of the role, and I later gave a look test and mouthed a few dialogues. Though I gave it my best, I didn’t have any expectations. But a few days later, the team called me to say that I fit the role perfectly.” 
 
 Though she’s not allowed to reveal any details, Mrinalini tells us that her role is quite interesting. “It is not your run-of-the-mill roles. This one is super interesting,” she smiles. 
 
 Mrinalini clarifies that she doesn’t share screen space with   or   in the film. She adds, “My portions were shot in Chennai. I had a great experience learning from Thiagarajan sir. He is an amazing director. He is a perfectionist and had everything organised. He knows what he wants from the artiste. He’s particular about timings. Working with him has only made me punctual and dedicated towards my work.” 
 
 Apart from Super Deluxe, Mrinalini also has debutant Suresh Kumar’s film in the pipeline. “Super Deluxe is most likely to hit the screens first,” she says, adding, “As of now, I am balancing my job at an IT firm and movies. My company has been kind enough to give me leaves. But if I begin to get a lot of offers from the industry, I will have to become very organised and plan my schedule well.”
