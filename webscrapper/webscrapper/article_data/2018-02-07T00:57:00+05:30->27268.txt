Salem: Ahead of the local body poll, AIADMK has started the drive to enrol new members to the party in the district. R Elangovan, Salem rural district Amma Peravai secretary, issued the membership forms to the public at a function held at Attur. 

 Talking to TOI, Elangovan said the party high command wanted to enrol at least one crore new members to the party across the state. “We have a plan to enrol 30,000 new members from Salem district alse,” he said.
 
 Attur town AIADMK secretary A Mohan, who took out a door-to-door campaign, said they would lure new members to the party by highlighting Amma’s schemes and her sacrifices for the state. “We will visit all the 33 wards in Attur municipality,” Mohan said.
 
 Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has, meanwhile, directed the party functionaries to enrol as many new members as possible to the party. “He has also urged us to complete the enrolment drive before local body election,” Elangovan said.
 
 More than 500 AIADMK functionaries participated in the event.
