HYDERABAD: In a heartening development, the liver of a 70-year-old brain dead   man was recently donated to a 54-year-old patient undergoing treatment at MaxCure Hospital's Secretariat branch. 

 A 10-member team of doctors performed a 16-hour-long surgery on the recipient on March 5, and is set to discharge him in two days. A police constable by profession, the recipient Brijmohan Singh was admitted in the hospital with liver failure. He had to wait for six months after being registered with the Jeevandan scheme. The cost of surgery -- about 18 lakh -- was borne by the police department. 
 
 The case, apart from giving a fresh lease of life to Singh, has also put to rest the myth about young people alone being fit for  . Though some medical practitioners discourage people from opting for organs of donors above the age of 65, as they fear the organs might not function adequately post transplantation, many state otherwise. 
 
 Dr Ch Madhusudan, a gastroenterologist at Maxcure, who was part of the team that performed the recent surgery, said: "The liver, even among aged people, can be in good condition if taken care of. So we encourage people to opt for livers from such donors," he said. Sharing an update on the condition of the recipient, he said that the constable is normal and his liver is functioning well. Singh, he added, can easily survive another 10 years.
 
 There are others too who made similar observations about  . "People must not worry about the age as long as the organ is in good condition. Liver, especially, can be donated at any age," said one of them. 
 
 According to experts, nearly two lakh people die of liver failure in India every year. These lives, they say, can be saved through organ transplant.
