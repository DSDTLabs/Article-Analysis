Mumbai:   has razed a 180-sq ft   of the   (EMR) at   station two days after the   was inaugurated there.

 The EMR operator has now decided to shut the Re 1 clinic at Dadar. “We spent Rs 8-10 lakh to build the 180 sq ft extension to the EMR to accommodate the pharmacy, without which it is not viable to run the Re 1 clinic. Around 1,000 people have already benefitted under this project,” Dr Rahul Ghule of Magicdil, which operates the EMR. “They could have sent a notice when the work was on since three months. Only after the extension was ready, they demolished it.” The pharmacy sells medicines at discounted rates.
