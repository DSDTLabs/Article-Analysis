Panaji: With Divar increasingly being included in Sri Lankan pilgrims’ itinerary in Goa, the islanders are keenly waiting to host a delegation of cardinal Albert Malcolm Ranjith, archbishop of Colombo, 40 priests and lay people on Wednesday. The ecclesiastic delegation with faithful will pay a special visit to Our Lady Of Divar High school, Divar, and ancestral house of Fr Jacome Gonsalves on July 26 and also Our Lady of Piedade Church, Divar. St Joseph Vaz—over three centuries before he was canonized on January 14, 2015— and Fr Gonsalves are credited with reviving the Catholic faith in Sri Lanka. “The visits even before St Vaz’ canonization have become a regular feature now. The pilgrims and religious are keen to visit Fr Gonsalves’ ancestral house because they connect with Vaz and Gonsalves equally,” Fr Eremito Rebello, former vice postulator for the cause of canonization of St Joseph Vaz said. The pilgrims who will arrive on Monday, July 24, and depart on Friday, July 28, will also visit Benaulim, Vaz’ birth place and sanctuary of St Joseph Vaz in Sancoale.  “The visit is also part of preparations to compile a dossier of Fr Gonsalves to pursue his canonization,” Anthony D’Lima, a teacher of Our Lady of Divar High School, said. The school was started first in Fr Gonsalves’ house in 1964 and an interlinked extension was built in 1980. “The school office and primary classes are housed in the ancestral house,” he said.
