BHOPAL: A village sarpanch in Tikamgarh has been booked along with 10 more people in Mohangarh tehsil for forcefully taking away a tractor trolley carrying illegally mined stones. The villagers were booked on Tuesday.

 Tikamgarh SP Nimish Agrawal said, “The sarpanch and others were booked under various sections of the IPC including section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty among others).” Five days ago, the police had confiscated a tractor trolley carrying stones mined from a forest area. On Tuesday, the tractor trolley was handed over to the forest department. Sarpanch Sunita Khatik said, “The police action was wrong. Panchayats are empowered to mine stones for official work. The stones loaded in the tractor were mined for official purpose and there was nothing illegal in it.”
 
 Police said when the forest department was taking away the tractor trolley for further action on Tuesday the villagers stopped the forest department staff on the way. “They parked vehicles across the road and obstructed the way. They asked the forest department staff to hand over the tractor trolley to them,” said police. Following a complaint lodged by the forest department on the same day, the police raided the village and confiscated the vehicles used for stopping the government servants, besides the tractor trolley. A case was also registered against 11 villagers who were allegedly involved in the incident. However, Ankit Jain, a villager said, police booked some people who were not even present in the village and were attending a wedding in Tikamgarh when the incident took place. Sarpanch said that she would raise the issue of “police atrocities” at a proper forum.
