PHULPUR(ALLAHABAD): A late evening call at a friend’s elaborate wedding function in Varanasi was how   candidate   was asked to jump into   bypoll that will take place on March 11.

 Patel, who is a former Varanasi mayor, said that the gesture by his party was a pleasant surprise and reaffirmed his belief that BJP picks up commoners unlike dynasts or family members in other political parties.
 
 Phulpur, which is in Allahabad, is about 110km from Varanasi.He sidestepped criticism on being an outsider, a charge levelled by both   and Congress during their campaigns.
 
 “The brightest part of the BJP is that we are all a family. In BJP, a commoner like   or a fighter woman like Nirmala ji get top ranks. I was on a oneday vacation and was working as coordinator for   bypolls when I got this phone call from the party office that I will be fielded as a Phulpur candidate. This can happen only in BJP,” Patel said.
 
 Patel said that criticism over saffron party’s focus on social engineering or heavy reliance on non-Yadav OBCs is misplaced.
 
 “We OBCs are generally the backbone of the economy. We are present in agriculture, trading of milk, wheat, leather, or manufacturing of steel and iron and so on. Yet, there have been incidents when our community has been left out of crucial policymaking by the Congress and BSP governments of the past. If BJP has introduced steps to promote OBCs, then what’s wrong in it. We are not introducing any sub-quota for them anywhere,” said Patel.
 
 He though agreed that BJP has had a toehold in the Muslim vote bank in 2014 and 2017, but said that steps by his government like triple talaq bill proposal were a move to help the minority community and would win their support.
