CHENNAI: Pattali Makkal Katchi founder S Ramadoss came down heavily on the Union government for its proposed policy to detain students of Class 5 and 8 with support from states and claimed that the move will force the students into their caste and family-based occupation and result in child marriages.

 Ramadoss in a statement said parents of the students, who failed in Class 5 and 8 would not allow them to continue their   and would force them into caste and family-based profession and trade. It will also lead to child marriages, he claimed. Ramadoss lambasted the Union minister for his ‘groundless reasons’ that the standard of education had come down as students were promoted until Class 9 irrespective of their performance. 
 
 The PMK leader took strong exception to the minister’s comment that   in the country had become midday meal centres where students leave after consuming food. He said if the late Tamil Nadu chief ministers Kamaraj and MGR had thought on those lines the state would not have attained good enrollment ratio in schools and improved its literacy rate in due course of time. Union human resource minister Prakash Javadekar announced that the ministry suggested introducing a policy giving power to the states to hold exams for Class 5 and 8 students, who fail in the first attempt. It suggested   students if they fail in their second attempt.
 
 Ramadoss sought the Centre to drop the proposal, pointing out that in Finland, children who join schools at the age of seven, appear for examinations for the first time when they are 16 years old. The country sends 66% of school students to colleges, the highest among European countries, he said.
