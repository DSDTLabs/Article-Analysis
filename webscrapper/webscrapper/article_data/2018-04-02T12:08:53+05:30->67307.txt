CHANDIGARH:   leader Randeep Singh Surjewala took a dig at   during a rally at Nissing, Karnal, on Sunday, saying that there were rumours that the CM was planning to change his constituency because he feared losing in the next assembly elections.

 Surjewala, who was addressing a well attended ‘Jan Aakrosh Rally’, said the state government had even failed to implement announcements made by Khattar himself. “There are rumours that Khattar is looking to change his assembly constituency in the next elections. Is he scared of losing?” he asked.
 
 He went on to claim that Khattar and the   had betrayed farmers, youth and poor sections of society. “The people will teach a befitting lesson to BJP in the next elections,” he said.
 
 
 Former MLA and Hooda loyalist   organised Sunday’s rally, during which Surjewala also took on the BJP-led NDA government at the centre and Prime Minister  . He said the Modi government had not waived farm loans despite widespread farmers distress. “When they have not done this, what is the logic in writing off huge amounts of loans for a few selected industrialists?” she said. “This shows their priorities.”
 
 He said the BJP had duped farmers as they were not getting the promised 50% profit on their farm costs. “The Congress is committed to bringing back a smile on the faces of our farmers, youth, backward classes, scheduled castes and poor sections of society,’’ he said.
