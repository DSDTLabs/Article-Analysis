PANAJI: Class X students who had attempted to answer question 5d in the mathematics paper will be awarded three marks after the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education acknowledged a printing error in the diagram of the question. Mathematics teachers had brought the mistake to the attention of the board.

 Many of the students who had appeared for the Class X state   maths exam on April 3, had complained that a couple of questions in the test couldn’t be solved and had felt that those were not from within the prescribed syllabus. Some had also said that the paper was lengthy and that they found it difficult to complete it on time. 
 
 The board’s chairman,  , had subsequently said that the question paper would be examined by the board’s scrutiny committee. 
 
 After holding meetings with officials, teachers and parents, the board recently decided that extra marks would be awarded to students who had attempted to answer the flawed question. 
 
 It is yet to take a decision on how to compensate those who didn’t attempt the question after they found that something wasn’t right.
