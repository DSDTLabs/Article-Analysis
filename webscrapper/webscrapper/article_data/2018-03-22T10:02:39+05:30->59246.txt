BENGALURU: A total of 8.5 lakh students, including 70,253 repeaters and 23,199 private candidates, will appear for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examinations, scheduled to be conducted from Friday (March 23) to April 6.

 About 47% (3.9 lakh) of the candidates are girls. For the first time, the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board ( ) has digitised the process of collating data and issuing admission tickets through the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS).
 
 The board has uploaded the hall tickets/admission tickets, which each school can download from the designated portal and distribute them among students.
 
 “There are 14,385 schools across the state, and examinations are being conducted in 2,817 centres. Of these, 1,011 are cluster centres while 1,807 are non-cluster ones. Forty-five centres have been declared sensitive while 28 are hypersensitive,” said a press note.
 
 Like last year, the board has decided to pick examination centres randomly. However, it could not follow the randomisation process in 1,806 centres owing to their geographical location or no other school being available in the vicinity. “In each of these (1,806) centres, the chief invigilator has been brought in from another government school to ensure fair exams,” the release read.
