In a scathing attack on the NDA government over demonetisation,  , a key constituent, on Friday described it as the “worst regime in 10,000 years” and said the   leaders are living in fool’s paradise to think that the exercise would eradicate black money.

 Referring to a report of a woman stripping off in anger in front of the RBI regional office in Delhi after failing to get some old notes exchanged, the Sena said the plight of the hapless mother looked like a “government-sponsored Nirbhaya tragedy”. “If the government cannot see and understand the suffering of this woman, then such a ruthless and deaf regime would not have been in existence in the last 10,000 years,” said an editorial in Saamna.
 
 “If you term the act of this woman as nationalism, you need a Talibani doctor to treat your brains. Such atrocities against women happen only in Talibani regimes,” the Sena said.
 
 Training its guns on chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for supporting the demonetisation, Shiv Sena said if the CM’s stomach does not churn on seeing the woman’s plight, then he is a “helpless person”.
