 Nagapattinam: Asserting that late chief minister Jayalalithaa’s soul is guiding the AIADMK, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Wednesday said the dreams of those who think that the ruling government will fall, would never come true.
 
 Speaking at the 100th birth anniversary celebrations of late chief minister M G Ramachandran in Nagapattinam district, Palaniswami, in an indirect jibe at T T V Dhinakaran said, “Someone has started day dreaming with blindfold with doing anything for the people. That would warrant only grave danger to him. There is a limit for fantasy. If it exceeds its limit, it would ruin him as well as those who are trusting them.”
 
 He also accused the opposition parties of plotting against the government. 
 
 “Many are dreaming whether the ruling AIADMK government would fall in any manner. However, their intentions will never come true. Because, people trust this government. As far as ‘Amma’s’ soul is with us, no one could make the government fall,” he added. The district Nagapattinam was created by Jayalalithaa after she came to power in the state on October 18, 1991, he said. 
 
 Palaniswami also announced various welfare schemes for Nagapattinam district. A facility to station more than 8,000 fishing trawlers at Tharangambadi at an Rs 170 crore would be established.
