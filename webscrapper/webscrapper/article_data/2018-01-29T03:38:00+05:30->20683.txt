Panaji: Besides being used as a building stone, not much is known about laterite. “Although it appears to be of limited importance, it is one of the few rocks in the world where Rare Earth Minerals, that have tremendous applications, can be found. It constitutes a potential field for research since Rare Earth Minerals concentrated in laterite are used for a variety of purposes - in superconductors, computer memory modules and in satellites,” senior geologist professor Ashoka G Dessai said, adding that the rock also hosts precious mineral deposits like gold, nickel and cobalt. 

 “It is one of the potential resources of the future and Goa has it in abundance. We can’t disregard one of the most dominant formations of the state. Very soon or in the near future, the existing deposits on which the economy of the state depends, are likely to be exhausted very fast. That’s why we have to focus our attention on other materials,” said Dessai, Goa University’s former dean of faculty of pure sciences. 
 
 Dessai was speaking at Panaji on Sunday at the release of his book ‘Geology and Mineral Resources of Goa’. 
 
 If high grade iron ore is mined at the rate at which it was exploited pre-2012, the high grade iron ore reserves may not last beyond a decade, he said. “ We have to act prudently and cap the quantity of iron ore to be extracted per year. We can also blend high grade ore from neighbouring states with low grade ore from the state and sell this. This way our high grade ores will last longer and fetch more revenue,” he suggested.
