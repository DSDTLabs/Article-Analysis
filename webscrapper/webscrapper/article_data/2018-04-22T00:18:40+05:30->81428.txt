Udhagamandalam: An NGO has written to district collector J Innocent Divya to form a committee to safeguard the 18th century Stone House - the first building in Ooty. The building currently houses Ooty Government Arts College.

 “The building and its surroundings is not what it should be. If people and old students of the college come together, it could be improved,” said director of Nilgiri Documentation Centre (NDC) Dharmalingam Venugopal. 
 
 The Stone House is next only in importance to Fort St. George in Chennai among the heritage buildings in Tamil Nadu, says the letter that was submitted to the collector by NDC. 
 
 “There cannot be a more important heritage in the Nilgiris than Stone House. It deserves to be celebrated, promoted and preserved in this bicentenary year of modern Nilgiris,” it says.
