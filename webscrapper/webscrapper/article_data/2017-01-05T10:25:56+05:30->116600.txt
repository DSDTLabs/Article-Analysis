Moms are the best. They nurture you, ensure your well-being, and when you need a hug, they are more than willing to oblige. Best of all, when you fall sick, they take care of you, with a steady supply of soup and comfort food. They only ever have our best interests at heart, even if sometimes they can be a little overbearing. The same thing has been said about garlic, because no matter how overpowering its aroma is, it is always good for the body. Apart from its near-magical effects on digestion and skin, garlic is believed to be an excellent remedy for  . Recently, aged   was found to be instrumental in reversing the accumulation of plaques, thus preventing the development of atherosclerotic  .

 The study, conducted by Dr. Matthew J. Budoff and Ravi Varshney, included 55 patients between the ages of 40 to 75 years, and who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Before the study began, the participants were screened for amounts of total coronary plaque volume, dense calcium, non-calcified plaque and low-attenuation plaque. Subjects were then divided into two groups, one receiving placebo and the other receiving a daily 2.4g dose of aged garlic extract in the form of a supplement. A year later, subjects were screened again for the same parameters. The results were striking, revealing an 80% slow-down in total plaque accumulation. In addition, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels had also dropped. Subjects were found to have less plaque one year after garlic supplementation than they had before the study began, indicating that garlic potentially protects the heart from disease by controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis such as plaque accumulation and hypertension.
 
 So as William Shatner once said, stop and smell the garlic, thatâ€™s all you need!
