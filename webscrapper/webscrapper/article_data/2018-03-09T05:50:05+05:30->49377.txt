MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s economy is set to grow at a slower rate. From 10% in 2016-17, it is estimated to fall to 7.3% in 2017-18 as per the state’s economic survey. While insufficient monsoon rain has significantly pulled down agricultural growth, industrial growth, including manufacturing, too is set for a decline, the survey shows.

 Nevertheless, the state’s growth rate is slated to be higher than the country’s 6.5%. Maharashtra’s per capita income too is among the highest in the country and is set to grow from Rs 1.65 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh per annum. Also, according to the national economic survey, Maharashtra has the highest share of GST collections and the country’s exports.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “The decline in the state’s growth rate is mainly because of the lower monsoon last year, which was 84.3% of normal compared to 95% the previous year. We should also remember that the state’s economy is still growing faster than the national economy,” said state finance minister  , dismissing concerns about the lingering impact of demonetisation and GST on the economy.
 
 The survey forecast a negative growth rate in agriculture and allied services at (-) 8.3% in 2017-18 compared to 22.5% in 2016-17. The growth rate in crops was also negative at (-) 14.4%) compared to 30.7% the previous year. 
 
 The growth rate in livestock is pegged at 5.8% in 2017-18 compared to 11.7% the previous year. The growth rate of the fishing and aquaculture sector is expected decline sharply to 5.9% compared to 21.2% in 2016-17.
 
 But agriculture alone cannot account for a decline in the growth rate. It accounts for 11.9% in the computation of the gross state value added (GSVA) metric, or value of economic activity in the state. Industry accounts for 33.6% and services account for 54.5%.
 
 The survey shows that the growth rate for industry--a big focus of the Make in India campaign--is set to decline from 6.9 % in 2016-17 to 6.5% in 2017-18; for manufacturing from 8.3% to 7.6%; and for construction from 4.9% to 4.5%.
 
 The growth rate of services is set to marginally improve from 9.6% in 2016-17 to 9.7% in 2017-18, the survey shows. Within this, the growth rate for financial, real estate and professional services shows the biggest improvement: from 9% to 10.3%.
 
 “A decline in agricultural output does have an impact on economic growth because a fall in agricultural income lowers rural demand and impacts other sectors,” says economist   from TISS.
 
 But he points out that demonetisation and the imposition of GST have impacted the agricultural and industrial sectors at the national level. “This is reflecting in the growth rate of the economy both nationally and in the state,” says Ramakumar.
 
 Despite a decline in its growth, Maharashtra continues to score on several economic parameters. The state accounts for the highest share of approved industrial proposals in the country since 1991—a share of 17.9%, according to DIPP data. FDI inflows into the state from April 2000 to September 2017 account for Rs 6.11 lakh crore, which is 31% of total FDI at the all-India level, the survey shows.
 
 But fiscally the cash-strapped state continues to draw concerns, with an estimated debt of Rs 4.13 lakh crore in 2017-18, up from Rs 3.71 lakh crore in 2016-17. “This is well within fiscal limits. Our debt to GSDP ratio is 16.6%, which is much lower than the 22.2% limit stipulated by the  ,” says Mungantiwar.
