BENGALURU: The high   on Wednesday quashed the August 5, 2015 order passed by the transport department with regard to applications filed by private bus operators seeking permit to operate on nationalized routes. The transport secretary had ruled against them operating on these routes.

 Allowing the petitions filed by bus operators, Justice   has directed the government to redo the process in three months, in compliance of the order passed by the   in December 2014. The judge noted that the officer (T M  ), who passed the order, was only assigned to hear the plea, but usurped the power in deciding the issue.
 
 The court, which asked the authorities to consider the applications for temporary permits in 10 days, also remanded the petitions back to the tribunal for fresh consideration.
 
 The petitioners had argued that though the   on December 18, 2014 asked the authorities to afford an opportunity of hearing and pass an order, the transport secretary passed a one-line order to drop the proceedings without assigning any rhyme or reason.
