SITAPUR: Barely three days before the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh,   chief   came up with a bunch of promises to the voters on Sunday, including loan waiver of up to Rs 1 lakh taken by farmers, constitution of a special commission to resolve traders’ problems, launching a special drive against landgrabbers and getting FIRs registered against the mafia.

 The announcement came close on the heels of the BJP-led government waiving off two-month interest on loans taken by farmers from cooperative banks. Addressing a rally in Sitapur, Mayawati said there had been instances of farmers being harassed by banks and the problem needed immediate redressal.
 
 Ironically, it was during the BSP government the cases of farmers committing suicide in drought-hit Bundelkhand — mainly because of harassment by bank officials — had spiraled. 
 
 Attacking the SP regime over deteriorating law and order, Mayawati said a special drive to register FIRs would be launched if she came back to power. 
 
 A similar drive would be executed against the land grabbers, she said. “The crime in Bulandshahr Mathura, Dadri and Muzaffarnagar are testimony of anarchy prevailing in the state,’’ she said, adding that all SP goons would be put behind bars if she is elected to power Mayawati also reached out to traders and businessmen, often referred as vote bank of BJP, promising constitution of a panel to look into their problems.
 
 While she attacked other parties for coming up with a manifesto that will only be “forgotten later”, Mayawati, herself, was on a promise making spree on Sunday. She claimed her focus would be on socio-economic development.
 
 The BSP supremo said the opposition was fuelling concocted opinion polls to show BSP at bottom of poll graph.
