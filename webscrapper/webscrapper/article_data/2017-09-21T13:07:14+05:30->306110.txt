 “Komal, who was the wife of  , had married Ranjan. It is not clear whether she had divorced Mehul before marrying Ranjan. On Wednesday morning, Mehul along with   and four other unidentified accomplices barged into Komal’s residence at Rajaram Society, beat up Ranjan’s mother Vinu Moviya (54) and abducted Komal in a car. We have registered a case and started searching for the abductors and the victim,” said an investigating official. 
 
 “Once the woman is found, we will ascertain whether she had divorced Mehul. If she married without divorcing her first husband, she stands liable for prosecution,” added the official.
