I learnt to dance before I learnt to walk. My training started when I was four years old. I loved dancing as much as I loved the attention it got me. But it was after school that dance completely changed my perspective towards life. 

 Right after my board exams, I had two months off and a few neighbours asked me to teach their kids and keep them busy in the summer vacation. I started with four students and by the end of two months, I was teaching 20 kids. Nothing matched the joy of giving – especially, when it was received so beautifully. It is then I realised why dance was a gift to me. Dancing became my language, it synthesised the body, mind and soul to allow self-actualisation. My art was beginning to transform me as a person. 
 
 The essence of dance is to be still in movement and move in stillness. This defines my life purpose too – to be able to experience nothingness and embrace nothingness. It makes me whole and feel complete. Dance teaches us that we are everything and everything is us. 
 
 I’ve seen my students change spiritually through dancing. It’s not only one of the most effective mediums of self-expression but it’s holistic and therapeutic at every level – physical, mental,  , social, psychological, and spiritual.
 
 I have seen dance work like therapy for many people – boosting confidence in a child or helping children overcoming speech-related issues. I’ve seen dance being the source of strength for someone coping with a terminal disease. It even creates an intimate connection between a couple. An extremely powerful energy overtakes us while we dance and the movement and fluidity helps us connect with our inner selves.
