UDAIPUR: After fulfilling the Gujarat high court’s bail condition of spending six months outside Gujarat, Patidar quota stir leader   will leave Udaipur on January 17. 

 Though his externment period ends on January 13, Hardik has delayed his exit due to his belief on ‘malmas’ (a period considered inauspicious for new beginnings). 
 
 He will leave for Gujarat with a cavalcade of supporters on the morning of January 17 and address a large gathering in the afternoon at Ratanpur on Gujarat-Rajasthan border. 
 
 “It was a challenging period for me and I gained enormous love and support from people across Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Bihar. However, I strongly suspect they will either put me back in jail on some or the other pretext or get me killed on my reaching home,” Hardik told TOI. 
 
 With only a fortnight left for completion of his externment, a meeting of   (PAAS) conveners was held at his temporary residence in Rajasthan on Monday. 
 
 Hardik presided over the meeting attended by 144 conveners from Gujarat and members of the Patel NavNirman Sena. 
 
 “Hardik’s homecoming will be a big event and we are expecting a mass gathering of two lakh people at Ratanpur border. Thousands of supporters from all 36 districts of Rajasthan are also expected to gather at the venue in over 5,000 vehicles,” said  , Gujarat state president of Patel NavNirman Sena. 
 
 PAAS conveners Dinesh Bambhaniya and Brijesh Patel said a massive Gandhian style rally will be held. 
 
 However, PAAS conveners have warned that they will jam the national highways if police try to arrest or detain Hardik, said  , Udaipur president of Patel NavNirman Sena. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Dangi-Patel community from Udaipur division said thousands of supporters will move on 151 vehicles to escort the young leader on his return journey.
