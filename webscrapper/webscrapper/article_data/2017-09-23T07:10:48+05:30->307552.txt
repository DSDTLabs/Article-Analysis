AURANGABAD/PATNA: Two doctors and an assistant sub-inspector were injured in violence in   town on Friday.

 Town police station SHO Rajesh Kumar said the trouble started when one Dr Manish Kumar drove his car between the police jeep and a cash van near   branch on Maharajganj Road. “A woman constable asked Dr Manish to move his vehicle away and the two exchanged heated arguments. When the police tried to take the doctor to police station, a scuffle broke out after which local people gathered there and thrashed ASI Zia-ul-Hassan alleging that he was drunk,” the SHO said and added that police had to use force to disperse the crowd.
 
 He said both the injured ASI and Manish were taken to sadar hospital where one of the doctors allegedly hurled abuses on Hassan and rumours spread that he was thrashed again. “Police rushed into the hospital room leading to another round of scuffle in which Dr Sujeet Manohar received injury. Excise officials were also called to the hospital and they took breathalyser test of the ASI, which was negative,” the SHO said.
 
 The Bihar branch of   (IMA) in an emergency meeting at Patna requested DGP PK Thakur for immediate action against errant policemen. The IMA alleged that Dr Manish was assaulted just for not giving pass to a police vehicle. IMA’s Aurangabad members also threatened to go on strike if action was not taken.
