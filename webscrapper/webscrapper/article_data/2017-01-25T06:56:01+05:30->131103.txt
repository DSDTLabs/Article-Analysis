CHANDIGARH: When a greenhorn   member had contested the 2014   elections in Punjab, its candidates and volunteers had proudly worn their “Main Hoon Aam Aadmi“ topis. However, in three years the trademark headgear -a reminder of the party's anti-corruption roots -has been relegated to campaign accessory . Neither candidates nor volunteers are sporting it anymore in Punjab, though it can be seen in the campaign in Goa.

 During recent visits to Punjab, party supremo   preferred to wear a turban at public events. The party had introduced a band with “AAP“ written on it for its turbanwearing Sikh cadres last year. But the run-up to the assembly elections has seen the Akalis and Congress brand AAP leaders as “topiwalas“ to label them as outsiders.
 
 AAP leader in charge of Punjab affairs Sanjay Singh said there was no conscious effort by the party to bring down the visibility of the topi.“It is just that the turban band and party scarf have become more popular in the state,“ he said. “The idea is to wear the party symbol to express support. Many key leaders of the party in Punjab wear turbans and it suits them.“
 
 He adds there was no question of making a change in response to criticism by rival parties. “We do our work and are not affected by jibes made by other parties,“ he insisted.
 
 However, Congress secretary   said AAP was making a desperate attempt to shed its “outsider“ image. “The party does not understand the local sensibilities of Punjab,“ he said.
 
 Harmilap Singh Grewal, leader of the Apna Punjab Party (APP), who was earlier with AAP , added, “The side cap was never a part of Punjabi culture. Even before Independence, non-Sikhs used to wear the `turle wali' turban. The cap came into the AAP imagery from the Anna movement and it can never be accepted by people of Punjab.“
 
 However, an AAP candidate for the upcoming elections differed and said “The limit on expenses could be one reason why the caps have been distributed less.“
