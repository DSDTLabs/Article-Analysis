PANAJI: Twelve of the 13   at Sonshi in the   will continue to remain inactive as the Goa State   (GSPCB) has decided to defer the renewal of their respective consent to operate documents until a report on   is ready. 

 The board, which is presently functioning under the chairmanship of chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma, met on Friday to decide whether it should grant consent to operate to 39 mining leases, including those operating at Sonshi. During the meeting, officials sought more time to prepare and submit an air quality report. 
 
 GSPCB member secretary Levinson Martins, told TOI that the board has decided to intensively monitor the air quality in Sonshi. Stating that there were few ambient air quality monitoring stations at Sonshi, he said the board has now decided to use stations belonging to the mining companies operating there to check pollution. As such, the next board meeting has been deferred to May 13, he added. 
 
 All mining activity at Sonshi was halted last week, after the GSPCB refused to grant 12 of the 13 mining leases consent to operate due to the severe dust pollution they had been causing. Prior to this, the board had issued showcause notices to all the 13 mining companies for causing significant air pollution in the village.
 
 The high court of Bombay at Goa had also said that there should be no mining-related traffic plying along Sonshi’s roads until the GSPCB received and decided upon the responses of the showcause notices issued to the mining firms concerned.
 
 The board has also decided to defer the renewal of consent to operate documents of the 27 other mining leases until ambient air quality at each mine is monitored. “Based on their respective production capacities or on their leases, each mining firm has to furnish a bank guarantee until ambient air quality at the mine is verified, which is now likely to be done only after the monsoon,” a senior board official said.
