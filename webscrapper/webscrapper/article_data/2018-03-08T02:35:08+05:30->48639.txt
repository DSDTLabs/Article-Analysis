GURUGRAM: Around 80,000 properties had been put under wrong categories by the private agency hired by   to carry out a property tax survey in the city. This had been going on for a decade, without the civic body taking any action against the agency, paying them Rs 6.16 crore for the work instead, revealed Ward 34 councillor  . 

 The matter came to light after Rathee asked MCG secretary Y S Gupta to provide details of how many corrections had been made to properties in all four zones of Gurugram since 2014. MCG’s reply exposed the high error rate in its survey.
 
 MapmyIndia, a location and navigation technology solutions provider, is engaged by MCG to conduct a GIS-based property tax survey and distribute the tax bills within corporation limits.
 
 On the working of the agency, the corporation secretary, in his written reply (a copy is with TOI), said   was engaged in 2008-09 and an agreement signed on May 28, 2009. MCG has paid it Rs 6.16 crore for the property tax survey, assessment and distribution of bills.
 
 “Based on the surveys, number of units was 3,06,302 in 2008-09 and 3,69,235 in 2014-15. The latest figure is 3,78,405, of which, corrections have been carried out in 80,000,” said the reply. 
 
 When contacted, an official from MapmyIndia refused to comment.
