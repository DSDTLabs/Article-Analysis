Pune: Heavy lifting equipment maker   will partner with the Confederation of Indian Industry to spread awareness about industrial safety. 
 
 The company will conduct marathons, panel discussions, presentation competitions, among others, between March 4 and 8 at its Jejuri plant for the purpose. 
  
 “Industrial safety remains a much-neglected topic in the industry,” said Suhas Baxi, managing director (India) of Konecranes. 
  
 He added that there are no “reliable statistics” available to determine the number of accidents, the severity of them or their cause. However, he said companies are waking up to the need of industrial safety. 
  
 Also, it is generally observed that the industry has meted out different treatment to its permanent employees and those contractual or temporary. The contractual workers have to often put in long hours, which leads to fatigue and more accidents among them. Most of them also do not have the medical benefits and terminal benefits on par with the permanent workers. 
  
 A central law to rectify this is in the works. As per the draft, all employees are entitled to equal wages for equal work, and all the benefits on par with permanent staff. If this passes the floor of the house and is implemented in spirit remains to be seen.
