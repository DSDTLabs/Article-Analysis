BALASORE: A mob on Wednesday allegedly stripped a man and woman, tonsured their heads and paraded them naked around the village for allegedly having an extra-marital affair. The incident was reported from   village under Ramchandrapur panchayat in Oupada block of   district. 

 Sources said  , a married woman from the village, was allegedly involved in a physical relationship with  , also married, from the nearby Jagannathpur village. About a month back the two had eloped leaving behind their children. While   is a mother of two children, Das has a three-year-old daughter.
 
 On Wednesday some people spotted them in an objectionable position in a house in Ketakijhuri village. As the message spread, a mob burst in and finding the two together, dragged them out of the house and tied them to a tree. They tonsured their head, stripped them, tied them to a rope and paraded them around the village even as drums played on.
 
 Das, though, said the allegations are false and that the villagers assaulted them and filmed them. "No one came to our help. I am under severe mental stress. I need to gather some courage before I will file an FIR," he said. Asked about the reason for the villagers beating them, he said, "I had a friendly relationship with Behera for a long time. But a few neighbours suspected her of having an affair with me." The woman, on the other hand, remained silent.
 
  said Oupada police are yet to receive any complaint in this matter. "We will take appropriate action if the victims lodge a complaint," Sahu said.
