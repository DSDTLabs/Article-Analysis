BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Scores of passengers on board Jabalpur-Atari special   were in for a rude shock when the train departed Katni South railway station and started moving in the opposite direction on Tuesday morning. Before any major accident, railway officials realised the faux pas and halted the train and brought it to Katni-Murwara (KMZ) railway station.

 Railway administration has suspended the station master of Katni South Railway station after the incident. 
 
 The special train number 01707 leaves Jabalpur at 9.15 am and reaches Katni-Murwara at 10.28 am as per schedule. It passes through Katni-Murwara, Damoh Jhansi and other stations and reach Atari the next day at 11.45 am. 
 
 The train crossed Katni-South railway station but instead of going towards Katni-Murwara it started moving in the opposite direction, said sources. 
 
 This train as it had to go to Atari had to turn left towards  , but instead it took a right turn towards New Katni Junction, sources said. 
 
 The passengers were shocked and there was chaos, however by then the railway officials realised the mistake and the train was first made to stop at outer signals of New-Katni Junction and then made to return to Katni-Murwara, delaying it by more than 50 minutes, sources said. 
 
 “The station master has been suspended after the incident. The fault was that the train had to be sent through the loop line but it was sent through the main line,” central public relation officer of West Central Railway (WCR), Surendra Yadav told TOI.
