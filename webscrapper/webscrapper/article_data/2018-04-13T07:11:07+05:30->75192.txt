BENGALURU: Stating that a person’s life cannot be kept ‘dangling’, the high court on Thursday directed the state government to inform its decision by Tuesday with regard to a Mandya resident’s plea to allow him to go for kidney transplantation.

 Justice Raghavendra S Chauhan also asked the state government not to harp on in a hyper technical manner, considering the nature of the case. The court was hearing a joint petition filed by D K Ravi Kumar, 46, from Doddarasinakere village in Maddur taluk of Mandya district and S C Girija alias Girijamma, 55, a resident of Thuruganuru village, T Narasipura taluk of Mysuru district.
 
 Kumar, who had suffered a kidney failure, had sought permission to receive the organ from Girija. He had claimed that Girija was a distant relative and he had been advised by doctors to undergo renal transplant instead of continuing with dialysis. They jointly approached the state-level authorization committee for transplantation of human organs on February 20, 2017 with necessary documents, including affidavits containing the consent letter from Girijamma’s two daughters. However, the committee rejected the application on May 27, 2017, stating that Kumar and Girijamma were not in a position to establish their relationship. The two challenged it before the principal secretary (health) on January 30, 2018, but it was rejected on the same grounds. Kumar was advised to take treatment from   using the Yeshasvini health card. Following this, they approached the high court.
