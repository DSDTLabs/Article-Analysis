TRICHY:   (when water fails, functions of nature cease) is a slogan from the Thirukkural. “Nobody realises its meaning better than the farmers of Tamil Nadu, especially those in the delta districts, who lost everything to drought,“ says president of the   Cauvery  .

 Though the state government on Tuesday decided to declare all districts in Tamil Nadu drought-hit, the farming community is uncertain about the future.
 
 “Mere announcement of solatium for the kith and kin of farmers who killed themselves unable to cope with the drought situation is not enough. Many families have lost their sole breadwinner. The state government should help both the farmers and agriculture labourers by executing desilting works using the fund allotted for that purpose,“ Dhanapalan says.
 
 “The government should allot more funds to carry out desilting of channels, tanks, lakes and ponds across Tamil Nadu. The work must be assigned to farmers and agricultural labourers instead of contractors. This would help them meet the ends till the next agriculture season,“ he told TOI.
 
 The government should also set up `social wells', which would benefit the farming community in future, Dhanapalan suggested. “Since ground water ta ble is fast depleting, instead of digging at each and every land, use of `social wells' should be encouraged. All farmers, be it small or big, who want to taken up summer crops, should be allowed to use the facility ,“ he adds.
 
 Puliyur A Nagarajan, organiser of the farmers' wing of  , says the government should construct atleast 100 check dams across Cauvery and Kollidam, starting from  . “This would help to harvest minimum 200tmc of water. The dams should be handed over to the farmers and agriculture labourers in the respective areas,“ he said.
