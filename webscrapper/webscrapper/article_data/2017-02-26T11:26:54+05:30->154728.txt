PATNA: Bihar CM   on Saturday took a swipe at PM , asking what happened to his much-trumpeted “mother-son” relationship with the Ganga.

 Speaking at a seminar on the ‘Incessant Ganga’ organised by the state water resources department amid Nitish’s repeated demand for decommissioning of the Farakka barrage, the CM recalled Modi’s slogan “Maa Ganga ne bulaya hai" (  has invited me) to explain his candidature from Varanasi in the 2014   polls.
 
 “Ham jab pichhle saal Banaras gaye toh log kah rahe thein Ganga Maa khoj rahi hai kahan gaya mera beta,” the CM said, without naming Modi, evoking laughter from the audience comprising water experts, engineers and social activists from different states and abroad.
 
 The conference was attended by Magsaysay award winner ‘Jal Purush’ Rajendra Singh, noted environmentalists  , Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal and economists Bharat Jhunjhunwala and Jayanta Bandyopadhyay, among others.
 
 The CM called for a national debate on how to maintain the ‘aviralata’ (unhindered flow) of Ganga waters. “This conference is not meant to press for the demand to decommission the Farakka barrage but to discuss how to rid the Ganga of the heavy silt to ensure its incessant flow,” Nitish said.
 
 He reiterated Bihar would oppose the Centre’s decision to dredge the Ganga riverbed to ensure more depth for navigation of big vessels on the National Waterways No-1 from Haldia to Allahabad. “The dredging will not only kill dolphins but also distrupt the Ganga’s ecosystem,” the CM argued.
