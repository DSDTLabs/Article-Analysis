CUTTACK: The demand for medicinal plants and herbs have increased manifold this winter. There are many takers for herbs like arjuna, amla, tulasi, brahmi, aloe vera, ashoka, aswagandha, satabari, pipali, stevia and neem.

 Some people also want plants like Bhringaraj, which is not very common. This trend is new for us as customers mostly demand flowering and ornamental plants in the past, said  , a plant nursery owner in   area.
 
 Nursery owners have started growing these plants in large numbers. "Earlier I used to grow two to three varieties of medicinal plants. Now I have dedicated a major section of my nursery to medicinal plants and growing over 20 varieties. They are really profitable," said Manish Sahoo, another nursery owner at  .
 
 The medicinal plant varieties are sold between Rs 50 to 250 per piece. Even the medicinal nursery owned by   (CMC) is also doing brisk business. "We grow over 60 varieties of medicinal plants in our nursery. And we are selling at least 50 plants on any single day," said a staff of CMC. "Our plants are cheaper as we sell each plant at Rs 10," added the staff.
 
 The plant sellers have attributed the rising awareness about medicinal plants as the major reason for rise in its demand. "People are now more aware about the value and benefits of medicinal plants," said Sahoo. Customers have their own reasons for picking the medicinal plants. "The medicinal plants not only heal you but also purify the air. I love to grow these plants in my terrace garden," said  , a homemaker.
