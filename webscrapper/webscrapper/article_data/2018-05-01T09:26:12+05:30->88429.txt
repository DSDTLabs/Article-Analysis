DHARAMSHALA: A woman, who was reported missing last week, was found murdered in Jawali area of Kangra district on Monday. Her body was found in a tractor trolley filled with sand.

 Police have arrested three members of a family after the deceased’s son in his complaint told them that she had been missing after an argument with them (accused) on April 28.
 
 The deceased has been identified as   of Trilokpur area of Jawali division in Kangra district.
 
 “The deceased’s son Kripal Singh filed a complaint at Jawali police station on Monday. He said his mother had a heated argument with three members of a family on April 28 and had been missing since then,” said Kangra superintendent of police Santosh Patial.
 
 Those arrested in the case include Mata Das, his wife Shakuntla Devi and their son Purav. All three are residents of Trilokpur village. “They admitted to their crime during interrogation,” the SP said.
 
 Kripal works as a labourer with Das, who is a supplier of building material.
 
 According to cops, the reason behind the murder was a recently-purchased tractor by Kripal, which the accused wanted to register in Purav’s name.
 
 The complainant alleged that on Saturday night, the accused took advantage of his absence and started pressurising his mother to register the tractor in Purav’s name. “When my mother refused to do so, they killed her,” Kripal said.
 
 “The accused have been booked under Section 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. They will be produced before a court on Tuesday,” the cop said.
