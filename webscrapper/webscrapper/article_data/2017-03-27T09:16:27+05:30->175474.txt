NEW DELHI: Directorate of Education (DoE) will not immediately release any second list for admissions under the EWS/DG quota though close to 384 such   have not been filled up through the online admission process. 

 These seats have been left empty because either no application was received for these seats or the applicants have chosen a school of higher preference, DoE claimed. “There is no second list presently contemplated, except for very few spillover seats of last year, or cases of non-reporting by children” around May-June, states a circular.
 
 These 384 seats will remain  , said Atishi Marlena, adviser to the education minister. “These seats are empty because there are no takers, so releasing a second list has no point. Many schools admit students throughout the year because their seats are never filled up,” she said. The last date of admissions to seats allotted to eligible candidates through the online system is April 15. DoE received 1,13,991 online applications against 31,653 EWS/DG seats.
