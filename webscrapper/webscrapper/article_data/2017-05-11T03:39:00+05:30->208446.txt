Panaji: VIPs will no longer have the privilege of using a red beacon atop their vehicles.

 In a welcome change, the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has notified a change in Rule 108 and also issued a subsequent notification to specify vehicles permitted to carry multi-coloured lights.
 
 With the amendment in Rule 108, no vehicle in the country is permitted to carry a red light, except for ambulances carrying patients.
 
 As a result of the change in the rule, only a few vehicles are allowed to carry beacon light on top of them. MoRTH has, thus, instructed state transport departments to issue a public notice providing the list of authorities to whom the permission to use beacon light has been granted. Every vehicle permitted to carry the multi-coloured beacon light has to display a sticker on the window screen issued by the transport department.
