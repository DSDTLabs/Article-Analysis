NAGPUR: The wildlife wing of the forest department, which made tall claims of zero poaching, stands exposed after a sub-adult   has been found moving with a   snare in its neck inside the   Wildlife Sanctuary, 180km from here, in Yavatmal district.

 In the 148sqkm sanctuary, there are two males and two females with five grown-up cubs. One of the sub-adult cubs with a   in its neck was also sighted by a section of tourists from Adilabad and Hyderabad a few days ago.
 
 According to insiders, the tiger was sighted in Pilkhan area on Monday. There is an injury in its neck. However it is possible that wire snares might have been laid for the herbivores and the tiger may have got entangled into it. Seven years ago a tiger from Tipeshwar had died after getting trapped in snares.
 
 According to sources, the tiger has been caught on camera and an operation has been launched to track it. Officials are tight-lipped on the issue.
 
 Pench chief conservator of forest (CCF) & field director Rishikesh Ranjan said, “Though the tiger has been caught on camera and there is an injury in its neck, the wire snare has not been spotted. A wildlife vet has been sent to Tipeshwar to tranquillize the animal.”
 
 Wildlife experts asked if there is no snare than why a veterinary doctor has been rushed to Tipeshwar on Thursday morning. In nature, wild animals lick their wounds and have healing abilities. 
 
 Tourists who spoke to TOI said they saw a wire snare, something which Ranjan has denied.
