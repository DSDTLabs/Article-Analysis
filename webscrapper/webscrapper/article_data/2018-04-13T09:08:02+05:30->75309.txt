BHOPAL: Day in and day out she thought about making a short film. But constraints did nix her dream on more than one occasion. But 16-year-old   Goyal was not the one to give up easily. And when opportunity came her way, she did it with a flourish.

 ‘Parvarish -The Museum School’– an NGO, which works for underprivileged kids, helped her realise the dream. Pinky, who has been studying with   since Class 1, made the short film with a second-hand digital camera, gifted to the  .
 
 She said a photography and videography workshop proved a turning point. A few months later her wish came true when she received the camera as a gift. The upshot was the teenager made the short-film without any kind of guidance or assistance from professionals.
 
 Speaking about the movie, Pinky said, “We were getting bored after exams. While watching TV with my friends, I thought of making a short film to express my gratitude to the school and our mentor. I wrote the script and worked on some ideas suggested by my friends.”
 
 The movie captured the life of a little girl, who joins Parvarish at the tender age of five, badgering her parents to let her go to school. A few years later, the girl who is grown-up, is shown as a teacher at the same school. In a few decades, we see her accepting an award in recognition of her dedication for teaching, she said. “I have completed my schooling. I am still attached to the school and I want to take it forward. I want all underprivileged kids like me to be able to learn and grow,” Pinki said.
 
 Shibani  , founder of the school, was overjoyed with her student’s talent after watching the film.
 
 Ghosh said, “The values that have been conveyed by the movie and the fact that the kids wish to continue their association with the Parvarish as my successor makes me doubly happy.”
