MUMBAI: The   ( ) is likely to instal   cameras along the entire monorail corridor so that evacuation measures can be taken quickly during any emergency. Besides, evacuation chutes or midsection guideway are also being considered to evacuate passengers from the monorail in such situations, sources said. 

 Monorail services have been suspended since a fire on November 9. 
 
 The fire occurred because the monorail operators could not detect a flat tyre on one of the coaches. This tyre spun more, thus causing friction and the spark eventually came in contact with the lubricant of the tyre. The incident occurred while the train was going towards Chembur from Wadala depot to begin the day's passenger services. Fortunately, no one was inside the coach. 
 
 The incident had shocked the officials and citizens because the monorail coaches were billed as fire resistant. 
 
 A senior MMRDA official said, "We are considering installing CCTV cameras along the entire 20-km-long corridor to spot any emergency like fire or even damage to the rake. The control room can immediately relay a message to the train crew so that emergency evacuation can be carried out."
 
 The official added, "We will have to carry out a study on the locations where CCTV cameras will be needed to give the control room an unhindered view of the entire stretch. If found feasible, we will go ahead with this plan."
