The doctors’ strike at the civil hospital finally ended late on Saturday evening, after a case was registered against three relatives of a patient,  . All the three accused were arrested after investigation. 

 ACP   said, "Tomorrow, we will do the follow-up in the case and the statement of the staff nurse whose video was made will be recorded, after which the complaint will be taken further.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the strike on Saturday left patients greatly inconvenienced, particularly those who came from other states and cities. Since the next day was Sunday, many patients will have to visit again on Monday. 
 
 A four months pregnant resident of Dashmesh Nagar, Mahi Kaur, said, "I had pain on Saturday and went to the hospital but no one attended to me. I am anxious about the well-being of the baby. For me, money is an issue, that is why I have to come here as an ultrasound outside is expensive. I am in so much pain I cannot even walk properly. Now, I will have to come again on Monday and I travel by auto. It is an ordeal.” 
 
  and his six months pregnant wife wife,   came for a scan from   but had to go back. "My wife is six months pregnant and doctors asked to get a scan. She is suffering because of the strike. She is not supposed to travel due to complications in pregnancy but now we have to come again.” Another patient on a stretcher with a fractured leg also rued the trouble caused to patients.
