BENGALURU: The government has decided to order a   into alleged irregularities in procuring   buses, transport minister H M   said on Monday. 

 "The (transport) department has already recommended for an inquiry and the home ministry will soon issue a notification,'' Revanna said.
 
 There were several irregularities in the purchase of 94 Marco Polo buses during the previous BJP government when R Ashoka was transport minister, Revanna claimed. The irregularities were earlier probed by IAS officer S R Umashankar. 
 
 The   government, after assuming power in 2013, had scrapped the bus services citing loss. It had even asked Tata Motors and Marco Polo to refund the money to BMTC and KSRTC. 
 
  Free bus passes for workers 
 
  With an eye on elections, the government has decided to issue free BMTC passes to 2.25 lakh construction workers and passes to 2 lakh women garment employees under the Indira Sarige scheme. CM Siddaramaiah will inaugurate the scheme soon, Revanna said.
