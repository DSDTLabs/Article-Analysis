KOCHI: Delay on the part of   in registering an   against   and others in Syro Malabar Church land row is illegal and contemptuous, the Kerala   said on Thursday.

 However, Justice B   decided not to proceed with   of court proceedings as police have already registered an FIR as directed by the court. The court considered a petition filed by Martin Payyappally of Angamaly, questioning the delay in registering an FIR despite the court issuing an order on March 6. He had pointed out that the FIR was registered only on March
 
 
 12. Contempt proceedings were sought against Ernakulam range IG Vijay Sakhare and Ernakulam assistant commissioner K Laljy. During the hearing, state government’s counsel submitted that a copy of the judgment was received only on March 8 and that the FIR was registered four days later.
 
 When the court queried as to why there was delay in registering the FIR, government counsel argued that no time limit was prescribed in the court’s order. He also submitted that delay was also caused as there were holidays in between.
 
 However, the court again asked as to what prevents police from registering an FIR on holidays. The counsel replied that implementing the directions in the order took time and it did not amount to contempt. The court said though it amounts to contempt of court, further proceedings are being dropped considering the nature of the case and the multitude of documents to be perused for implementing the court directive.
