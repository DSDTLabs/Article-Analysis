Trichy: A portion of the newly-laid stretch on the Collector Office Road has been damaged by a political party for erecting its hoardings. The stretch was among the 38 road project works completed by the Trichy Corporation recently.  As arterial roads in the city were in bad shape, the civic body in October 2017 sanctioned Rs 11.65 crore for the construction of new roads and also to do away with patch works. Subsequently, between January and March 2018, as many as 38 road works were completed amidst questions raised over the quality of roads laid and deviation from Indian Roads Congress standards. Meanwhile, on Saturday, a part of the Collector Office Road, close to the district industries centre (DIC) was seen damaged for erecting banners to welcome R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran, who was in the city to participate in a protest. At least two wooden poles were seen placed on the new road after certain surface of the road was chipped off to make the banner stand. Stating that such damage to roads even if it was minor would affect the quality of roads in the longer run, social activists have urged leaders of political parties to restrict their cadres from damaging public properties to garner attention. “Enforcement authorities have always been hesitant and on the back foot to punish offenders damaging public properties, particularly the roads. Authorities should sensitise political parties and stage decorators about the punishments they attract under Prevention of Damages to Public Properties Act for damaging roads to place hoardings,” K Chandrasekar, a Trichy-based social activist said. The supporters of Dhinakaran had also made best use of the traffic island around Major Saravanan roundabout and pedestrian platforms to place party flags and banners to welcome their leader. Trichy Corporation even after being intimated about the incident did not initiate any action against the offenders for damaging the newly-laid Collector office Road.
