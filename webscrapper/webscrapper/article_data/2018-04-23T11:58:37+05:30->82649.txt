CHIKKAMAGALURU: Samaradhane, the ritual on the 13th day after a person's death, is believed to help the deceased attain 'moksha' (salvation). As part of the ritual, the family of the deceased prepares a non-vegetarian feast ( ) for their relatives and friends.

 
 However, this family in  's  , which is mourning the death of Dr  , a gynaecologist, cannot organise any such feast. The family has been forced to restrict 'baadoota' to family members as the model code of conduct is in force.
 
 As per the model code of conduct, serving 'baadoota' to a large gathering of people is considered an offence irrespective of the nature of the event.
 
 Dr Sushma's 13th day ceremony is on April 25, Wednesday. Her father C Sidramappa, a retired officer in the state transport department, had printed cards to invite villagers, relatives and well-wishers in large numbers. However, officers deputed by the   to monitor the implementation of the code of conduct in the district directed him to invite only family members and close relatives. They warned him against inviting politicians, especially those contesting the election, for the ritual.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sidramappa's brother Venkatesh Ajjampura said: "Officers informed the family that serving baadoota for a large number of people is an offence under the code of conduct and asked us to ensure that only relatives attend the event."
