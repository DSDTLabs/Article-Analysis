      PILIBHIT: Some of the pressing problems confronting around one lakh Bengali refugees are expected to become major poll planks considering their sizable number of votes — 65,000.        In Puranpur constituency alone, the number of Bengali refugee voters is more than 15,000, who said they would cast their votes on February 15 after closely reviewing candidates’ accountability towards them.        Migrated from East Pakistan (present Bangladesh) to India in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, theseBengali refugees had been struggling to find solutions to their various problems. Many of them have still not been awarded Indian citizenship, and therefore, they don’t have right to vote. Their applications to the Union government around 20 years ago were neither answered nor rejected. Consequently, they are living in India without being its citizen. Besides, the revenue titles of their land has not been regularised by the state government thus far, making them suffer financially.        Interestingly, almost all Bengali refugees have been allotted land in Pilibhit district for their housing and sustenance. As per a veteran Bengali leader, Gaurang Adhikari, a resident of Chandia Hajara village under Puranpur tehsil circle, most of the migrant Bengali families had been allotted 2 hectares in close proximity to forest areas.        A lawyer belonging to the Bengali refugee community and a resident of Gabhia Sahrai village under Kalinagar tehsil, Nityanand Malik, who claimed himself to be a caretaker of the community as far as issues related to social and legal rights are concerned, told TOI that more than 7,000 Bengalis in the district were still deprived of Indian nationality.        Their applications had been sent to the union government about 20 years back, along with the valid verification by the local intelligence unit and the recommendations of the district magistrate, but to no avail, he said.        Malik further said the Manmohan Singh government had imposed a ban on validation of any migrant Bengalias Indian citizenship that completely wiped out their hopes. The Modi government reinstated the old process, but imposed a hefty fee of Rs 5,000 per application, which was quite unaffordable for the poor refugees, he added.        “We even paid the stipulated fee after borrowing from moneylenders on heavy interest, but there is no response from the government even after more than two years,” said Sunil Sana, Sudann Rai, Haren Mandal and Natwar Vishwas, all residents of Gabhia Sahrai village.        When asked, district magistrate Masoom Ali Sarvar told TOI that the central government solely exercised its decision and discretion in granting citizenship, and the district administration’s role was limited to sending timely reports in response to a query.        Malik alleged that even after 40 years, the revenue titles of their land had not been regularised by the state government, which restrained them from seeking loans. He termed the situation “a big barrier in the way ofBengali community’s financial progress”.        “We have also been struggling for declaration of Namoshudra, Pond and Majhi communities of Bengalirefugees as Schedule Castes as had been done by West Bengal. But this justified demand too was thwarted by the government, while elected representatives remained apathetic to our problems and hardship,” Malik rued.        He said the Bengali refugees would cast their votes on February 15 after closely reviewing candidates’ accountability.
