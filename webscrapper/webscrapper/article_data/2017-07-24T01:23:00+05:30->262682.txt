GURUGRAM: The   coordination committee announced on Sunday that that they would go on a state-wide   on Tuesday to   the recent cut on the   seat   in buses.

 Demanding reinstatement of the staff   quota in buses, employees of Haryana Roadways said, they have been working for 12 to 18 hours a day due to staff shortage, yet the government is snatching the few facilities they have. “At a time when we are struggling with our existence and fighting against the licence given to private players, they have found another way to demean us. They have taken away one privilege that we are entitled to,” said Jaideep Lather, Roadways leader, Gurgaon.
 
 “This is not the first time when the government has attacked our self-respect. We are also living under constant fear of losing our jobs. Earlier, they fired 52 employees in Dadri and now they’re planning to fire computer operators too. There are 365 employees in Haryana Roadways, including 65 from Gurgaon, who haven’t been paid since last four months,” said Lather.
 
 During the strike, the workers will also put forth their demands that all sacked people be re-employed and contractual workers be paid. They’ll also ask the state government to include at least 14,000 buses.
