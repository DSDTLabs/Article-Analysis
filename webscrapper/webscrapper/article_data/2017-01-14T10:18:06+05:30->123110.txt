Kolkata:   won’t benefit anybody, only common man will suffer more because of it, said two noted economists in the city on Friday. Professor emeritus of University of California, Berkeley, Pranab Bardhan and professor emeritus of JNU Amit Bhaduri were addressing a session at the bicentenary celebration of Presidency University.

 Bhaduri went a step further and raised question on whether demonetisation can unearth nexus between corporates and political parties. 
 
 Asked about the impact of  , Bardhan said: “It is bad and unthoughtful. Poor people are suffering due to this,” he added.
 
 Bhaduri argued that there will be a contraction of the economy in short term. “The immediate impact is contraction of economy. It is difficult to talk about long term, but I feel the only man who could be benefited by this is   and nobody else,” he added. RBI has already downgraded the growth number by 50 basis points (0.5%), while some economists feel that it could be even 2%. Bhaduri also pointed fingers at increasing influence of corporations in policy making in India and globally. 
 
 The UCB professor harped on a transparent system where financial dealings of all political parties will come under RTI. Bhaduri criticised subsidy structure of the Central and state governments. He termed Singur and Nandigram as one of the worst examples of doles offered to big corporates by the governments.
