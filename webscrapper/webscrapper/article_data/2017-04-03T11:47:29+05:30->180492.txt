PUNE: The   will soon ask   as well as self-help groups across the district to help reach out to rural families and ensure they use the newly-constructed toilet blocks.

 The administration recently declared the district to be free from open-defecation, ahead of the March 31 deadline. 
 
 After constructing over a lakh toilets in a year, the district administration has taken up the task to ensure that families use the toilets. 
 
 “Our next move is to ensure that the blocks aren’t used for any other purpose as has been reported in many other parts of the state. We will request the   members and members of self-help groups to sensitise the families that aren’t using the toilet blocks. If families do not use the toilet blocks, then the administration will take up the case accordingly,” stated Rahul Sakore, deputy chief executive officer (water and sanitation), Pune Zilla Parishad.
 
 Sakore told TOI that 1,400 gram panchayats in the district have been declared open-defecation free. Members of the gram panchayats have also been told that they should ensure that the blocks are used.
 
  In other parts of the state, there have been instances wherein villagers have continued to answer nature’s call in the open despite having toilets at home. A few families have also used toilets as store rooms
 
 Pune district joins ten other districts in the state that have achieved the open-defecation free status. Across the state, 85,54,721 toilets have been constructed while 29,32,914 families are yet to undertake the work.
