CHANDIGARH: The district consumer disputes redressal forum has directed   ( ) to pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for “illegally” demanding and retaining Rs 1.57 lakh from a flat owner in Sector 63, Chandigarh, on the pretext that he did not deposit the money within a stipulated time. The housing board failed to prove the case.

 The Chandigarh Housing Board was also asked to pay 18% interest on the amount retained for the period in the account of the housing board. The housing board officials were
 
 also asked to refund Rs 23,163, i.e. the amount which was still not refunded along with 18% interest from the date of deposit till realization.
 
 The complainant  , who lives in Sector 63, said that he was a successful allottee of dwelling unit number 2329A (one bedroom flat in Block No.30, Sector 63). He said that the CHB issued acceptance-cum-demand letter (ACDL) on December 12, 2011, according to which the CHB prescribed the mode of payment.
 
 “It was specifically mentioned that as per clause 3 (ii), in case full payment of the dwelling unit was made within 30 days from the date of issue of ACDL, no interest would be charged. Further clause 3 (iii) provided the rate of interest of the housing scheme was 12% per annum,” he said.
 
 In pursuance of the letter, the complainant said he made full and final payment through demand draft dated January 9, 2012, which was credited in the account of the CHB on January 11, 2013.
 
 However, he got another letter on July 19, 2013, demanding more money following delay in payment.
 
 In response to the letter, he deposited a sum of Rs 1,57,416 in the account of the CHB. However, the complainant said this amount was “illegally” demanded because he had already cleared his payment within 30 days as per the ACDL.
 
 Thereafter, as per the letter dated September 11, 2014, the CHB stated that the account of the complainant was re-examined and it was found that a sum of Rs 23,163 was still outstanding.
 
 On February 16, 2015, the housing board sent a cheque of Rs 1,34,253 after the complainant raised the issue and made multiple visits and retained Rs 23,163.
 
 CHB in its reply admitted that a sum of Rs 1,57,416 was deposited by the complainant which was lying in the miscellaneous account and due to rush, it could not be reconciled at that time. Once this fact came into the notice of the board, it immediately got the amount verified by the bank and after that refunded Rs 1,34,253.
 
 The forum after hearing both sides observed that CHB has owned up the responsibility that the amount was lying in the miscellaneous account due to rush.
 
 “This shows the CHB officials were deficient in service and negligent. If there was bonafide mistake or say a human error it could have been corrected once the matter was raised orally or in writing by the complainant, but, it was not done. Unnecessarily this amount was retained. No explanation was offered why Rs 1,34,253 only was refunded and not the remaining amount of Rs 23,163.”
 
 About the 30 day period in which the amount was to be deposited, the forum stated that the dates of issuance of the letter and dispatch are different and this period, in common sense, would be taken from the date of receipt of the letter and not from the date of issuance or say its dispatch.
