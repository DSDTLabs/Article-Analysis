HYDERABAD: About two weeks after a class 9 student committed suicide for allegedly being harassed by the school management over non-payment of fees, the   (NCPCR) has directed all state governments to ensure that issues pertaining to fee are dealt with parents and not children.

 On February 2, a student of   in   hanged herself after she was allegedly made to stand outside the class for failing to clear dues of Rs 2,000. The suicide drew the attention of the NCPCR which shot a letter to chief secretary of all state governments, including Telangana, on February 12.
 
 “Reported cases of suicidal deaths of school students due to harassment for non-payment of school fee and discriminative behaviour by the school authorities/principals/teachers is a grave concern,” read the letter issued by  , member of NCPCR.
 
 According to the letter, the commission has been receiving many complaints on this issue. Terming the fee issue as afinancial matter between the school authorities and the parents, the commission, in the letter instructed respective governments to “issue directions to the private school authorities to deal all the fee related issues with the parents and not with the students and prevent fee related harassments and suicidal deaths.”
 
 The NCPCR’s move has come as a relief to parents. “School authorities have started targeting students over fee issues. Harassment over nonpayment of fee amounts to corporal punishment, which has been on the rise in private schools. Since government authorities are not doing enough to curb the menace, the NCPCR has emerged as a saviour,” said  , president of India wide Parents Association.
