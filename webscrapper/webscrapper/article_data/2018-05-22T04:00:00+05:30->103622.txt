Bharuch/Surat: A large number of Keralites living in Surat and Bharuch have demanded direct fight connectivity between Surat and Kochi. 

 Malayali Welfare Association in a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation said that as a substantial number of Keralites lived in Bharuch, Ankleshwar, Dahej, Surat and Vadodara, there is a need to start flight services between Surat and Kochi. In the absence of air connectivity between Surat and Kochi and Vadodara and Kochi, many Keralites are forced to travel by train, which means a 30-hour journey for them. 
 
 Sugunan Ramakrishnan, former president, Malayali Welfare Association, Bharuch, said, “Airlines would get enough passengers in view of large number of Keralites residing in the region.”
