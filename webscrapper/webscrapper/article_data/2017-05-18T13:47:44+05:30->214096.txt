CHANDRAPUR:  , ASR Nayak, has warned the people of Ravi (Arsoda) and surrounding villages against a tiger in the area.

 The forest department has laid two cages to capture the beast, while eight camera traps have been installed to monitor its movement. Residents of Ravi and surrounding villages are in a state of fear after the tiger had killed farmer   on May 13 at his farm.
 
 Moreover, Lavhaji Meshram from the nearby Kondala village was also killed in April by the same tiger. The forest department has inferred that it is an migratory tiger that has come from the adjacent Bramahapuri forest division after crossing Vainganga river that skirts Ravi.
 
 With plenty of water, good jungle and ample prey base, the tiger has settled here since the last couple of months. Many villagers have seen the tiger moving around Ravi and Kondala.
 
 Nayak visited Ravi on Wednesday and met the kin of Marappa. He also reviewed preventive measures taken by the forest department in the village. He warned the people to be alert against the tiger and directed the MSEDCL to cancel power cuts at night in the area.
 
 Forest officials said they have put machans around the village where watchers have been deployed to warn against tiger movement. Four forest staffers and a team of villagers are carrying out patrolling around the village in the morning and evening hours.
