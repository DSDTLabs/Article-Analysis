TIRUPUR: A 29-year-old   was found dead on the railway track near Vanjipalayam here on Saturday. While government railway police suspect it to be a case of accidental death, a source in the police department said he might have committed suicide as he was neck-deep in debt.

 The deceased was identified as P Mohan, of Ammapettai in Theni district. Attached to the armed reserve police force in the city, Mohan was part of the striking force at the police commissionerate. He was residing alone at Sirupooluvapatti, while his family was away at Ammapettai, the source said.
 
 The body was found on the railway track between   railway station and Vanjipalayam. When alerted, government railway policemen reached the spot and found the body in a disfigured state.
 
 “We recovered a mobile phone and it helped trace the identity of the deceased. Preliminary investigations revealed that he used to report for duty regularly and it looked like that he was on his way to the office on Saturday. Since he stays in a house located close to the railway track, he could have tried to cross it and in the process might have been run over by a train. We are, however, yet to zero in on the train involved in the accident,” a government railway police officer said.
 
 Meanwhile, a source in the police department said Mohan was under depression as he had borrowed money from a lot of people and couldn’t repay the same. “Chances are high that this might have driven him to take the extreme step,” the source said.
 
 Podanur government railway police have registered a case under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and further investigations are on.
