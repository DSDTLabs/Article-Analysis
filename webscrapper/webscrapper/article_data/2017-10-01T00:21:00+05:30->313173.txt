Trichy: A Nadaswaram artist from Kumbakonam played the rare acoustic instrument made of granite after 15 years at Adi Kumbeswarar Temple in Kumbakonam at Thanjavur district, in view of the ongoing Navarathri puja.

 The popular traditional classical instrument here is usually made of wood. But this has been sculptured in a single piece of hard granite.
 
 In temples, for all the rituals starting from the morning ‘Thirupalli Ezhuchi’, a ritual of waking up the Lord to the Ardhajama puja, to ‘Palliarai puja’, a ritual to let the Lord go to sleep, the Nadaswaram finds a part to play. This is also considered to be a Rajavadyam.
 
 After appeal by devotees, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department handed over the granite Nadaswaram to the Vidwan N Swaminathan,56, to perform during the Navaratri puja at the Aadhi Kumbeswarar temple. He has been playing the instrument for the last 27 years.
 
 He played the keerthanas such as 'Pandurothi', 'Shanmugapriya', 'Darmavithini', 'Hemavathi' for about one hour and a large number of devotees enjoyed the devotional pieces.
 
 "Usually this granite Nadaswaram would be played at the time of Mahamaham and Masi Maham. I have played this 15 years ago at the time of Masi Maham. After that, it has been kept at a safe maintained by HR and CE officials. As the devotees kept on appealing to the Executive Commissioner of the temple Kavitha, she allowed me to play the instrument", he said.
 
 Usually one has to lend his full effort to play Nadaswaram. In the case of granite, artists should provide his maximum effort, he said.
 
 “This instrument is being kept at the temple for more than 100 years. Earlier my relative was playing Nadaswaram at the temple for more than 36 years. As I have no interest in playing Nadaswaram, my cousin is accompanying me”, he further added.
