HYDERABAD: Auto driver  , whose passport was revoked last year allegedly based on intel reports, was asked by Regional Passport Office (RPO) officials on Thursday to apply for a fresh passport.

 “You are advised to apply for passport in fresh category at nearest Passport Seva Kendra with requisite documents,’’ RPO, Hyderabad, in a written communication, told Ibrahim without justifying what made them take this decision.
 
  
  
 
 In 2015, after following due procedure, 47-year-old Ibrahim of   had got his passport renewed. In March, 2017, when he was about to take a flight to Sharjah, the immigration officials seized his passport without giving any reason and asked him to contact RPO, who inturn directed him to contact Hyderabad police.
 
 “For no mistake of mine, I am being troubled. The problem is that my renewed Indian Passport was earlier seized by immigration officials at the   without citing any reason. Now, I am being asked to reapply. Since my earlier passport has been seized, in its absence, what should I produce to justify my position that I had a passport,’’ Ibrahim told TOI.
 
 When Ibrahim asked RPO officials why he was asked to apply afresh, he was not given a reply except stating he might not have any problem now.
 
 After TOI carried a series of reports on Ibrahim’s ordeal, RPO officials had sent a letter asking Ibrahim to appear before them to give an explanation without actually stating the subject and why his passport revoked. Though officials said a communication was sent prior to the intimation mentioning the reason, Ibrahim claimed he had not received any letter. Earlier, RPO officials alleged Ibrahim’s passport was revoked since they got intelligence report that he was a   national.
