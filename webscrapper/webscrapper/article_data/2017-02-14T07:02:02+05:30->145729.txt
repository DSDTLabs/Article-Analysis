BENGALURU: Promises made by the Congress government to bring about social change are unlikely to turn into reality. Since 2013, two bills mooted by senior cabinet ministers and approved by chief minister Siddaramaiah — one against superstitious practices and another which seeks to cap wedding expenditure — have been kept in abeyance. 

 Senior ministers told TOI the government has more or less decided to drop the bills on account of the assembly elections scheduled next year. Law minister T B Jayachandra was recently questioned by people on what happened to the bill on checking ostentatious weddings. “I had no reply. I decided not to attend a lavish wedding considering the person had spent nothing less than Rs one crore in a small town like Sira, but questions are being raised about the government’s intent. We will see how it can be worked out,” he said.
 
 However, sources in the government said the decision has been taken due to pressure from party legislators. “Legislators are asking why should we take the risk of bringing in the legislation in an election year? Why should we antagonize people?” said a minister.
 
 Health minister K R Ramesh Kumar, who tried to bring in a private bill on curbing wedding expenditure and has spoken against it time and again, was not reachable for comments.
 
 On the other hand, the anti-superstition bill is also likely to be shelved. As a compromise, the government has decided to put out an amended version of the bill in the public forum. Jayachandra said the law department had sought an opinion from former Supreme Court judge and former Lokayukta Justice Shivaraj Patil. “Once we get his opinion, we will put it out for public debate,” said Jayachandra.
 
 The anti-superstition bill has been vehemently opposed by both Congress legislators and other party leaders.
