JAISALMER: A   shop, opened on Chauhatan road in Barmer, saw   from hundreds women, men and children on Wednesday. The protestors burnt tyres and put barricades on the road.

 A memorandum was submitted to the district collector on Tuesday and seeing no action from the administration, they came on road. The excise department has given license to open a liquor shop at Hamirpura on Pratapji ki Prole and locals say there are four anganwadis in nearby area and it will become difficult for women and children to pass by. 
 
 There is doubt over excise department that as per guidelines, liquor shops should not be opened within prescribed distance of religious places, schools and public places but the department has given permission to open liquor shops at nearby these places. Recently, women near Jatia Bhawan on Chauhatan road protested and police had lodged case against 125 people for demonstrating. But, when police checked, there was doubt on excise department. Similarly, people protested by burning tyre for not opening liquor shop near   bypass. Barmer deputy SP OP Ujjawal said women protested and blocked the road. Three days ago, case was lodged against dozens of people at   and Sadar police station for protesting against liquor store, said Ujjwal.
