MUMBAI: Pakistan may have reopened its doors to   after a brief spell of suspension following cross-border tensions, but ' ', the film that smashed all box-office records to become the highest-grossing Indian movie ever, will not make it to the neighbour's screens.

 Aamir Khan, who is Dangal's co-producer and plays the lead role, decided against releasing the film in Pakistan after the Pakistani Central Board of Film Censors demanded last week that two scenes involving the Indian flag and the national anthem be cut.
 
 “Pakistan had been very keen on releasing the film and several distributors had been talking to us, but after their censor came back with a demand for two cuts,   decided to stall the release,“ Khan's spokesperson told TOI.
 
 “Not only are the scenes pivotal to the film, there's nothing jingoistic that is demeaning towards another country or person. He felt that the demand seemed unreasonable so we either release the film as it is or not at all,“ the spokesperson added. Mobashir Hasan, head of Pakistan's censor board, declared that “the decision is the collective wisdom of the board“, adding that it was now up to the local distributor to release it or not.
 
 Dangal narrates the reallife journey of a Haryana villager Mahavir Phogat and his wrestler daughters Geeta and Babita. The two scenes that Pakistan's censors asked to be removed appear at the very end of the film, when the story hits the climax and celebrates a winning moment. “Every sports movie honours the winner and his or her country. It's only natural and in good spirit,“ said Khan's spokesperson.
 
 Dangal has already minted Rs 385 crore. “If it released in Pakistan, Dangal would have probably made Rs 10 to 12 crore, which it won't now and there will be piracy too but it was a stand that we had to take,“ the spokesperson added.
