MARGAO: Raising questions over transparency in the system of awarding tenders, the   ( ) on Friday rejected demands for e-tendering the sopo tax collection contract, or inviting sealed tenders for the purpose, and settled for the open bidding system instead. 

 Ketan Kurtarkar from the opposition made a strong pitch for the e-tendering mode to award the sopo contract, and found some support from Arthur D’Silva. 
 
 Pointing out that the open bidding system facilitated blatant manipulations by contractors, Kurtarkar questioned chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai about her disinclination to consider the advice of the director of municipal administration to opt for inviting sealed tenders for the sopo contract.
 
 Things came to a boil when Kurtarkar questioned the silence of a group of councillors over the matter. This led to a war of words between Kurtarkar and  , prompting the chairperson to demand an apology from the former. Kurtarkar refused to oblige. 
 
 The chairperson’s decision to restrict the eligibility of contractors to at least two years of experience for bidding also led to some objection, with councillors demanding that the experience criteria be done away with as sopo collection was not a skilled task. Prabhudessai, however, stood her ground over the issue. 
 
 The council also gave its nod to pay Fomento Green the concessionaire of the solid waste management plant at Sonsoddo its pending installments amounting to Rs 2.4 crore as advised by the disputes redressal committee.
