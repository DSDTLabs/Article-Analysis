HYDERABAD: The Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured (IDDM) category will be the  's first priority when it comes to procurement of weapons and spare parts, said Air Marshal SB Deo, vice chief of air staff.

 Delivering the first lecture at the technical meet and aerospace luminary lecture series of the  , Hyderabad Chapter, on Sunday , Air Marshal Deo called for more passion among entrepreneurs in the engineering sector.
 
 “Entrepreneurs in the country are unfamiliar with the needs of the defence sector. Many more are not quite passionate about the engineering that goes into designing products for the defence sector and are unaware of the importance of paying attention to detail. Also, we have faced situations where Indian entrepreneurs making indigenous products have quoted prices higher than the total cost of procurement of the same product from a foreign country ,“ said Deo.
 
 The products designed under this category need to be cheaper since they are indigenous, he added. Speaking about Hyderabad's role in contributing to the Make In India scheme, Air Marshal Deo said, “With the kind of technological infrastructure available in Hyderabad, I am certain that passionate entrepreneurs will be able to contribute significantly in terms of indigenous products.“
 
 The second lecture of the series was delivered by  , director of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Manna spoke about the 'Evolution of Microstructure in Engineering Materials' and the IMPRINT programme a single window mechanism for funding India-specific research across IITs in the country. “The total funding required for the 259 short-listed projects under IMPRINT is under '6 crore. Even this amount is hard to obtain from various departments. 60 projects are currently underway while 40 are being sanctioned. There are more than 50 institutes and around 800 scientists from across the country involved in this project,“ said Manna.
