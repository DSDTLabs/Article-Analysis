VISAKHAPATNAM: Two major food processing units have commenced operations in the neighbouring districts of   and   entailing an investment of close to Rs 100 crore. Sources said while one company has made an investment of close to Rs 90 crore for setting up an integrated coconut processing centre in Srikakulam, another firm has invested close to Rs 7 crore for setting up of a primary processing centre and is currently in the process of exporting mangoes to Iran.

 Andhra Pradesh Food Processing Society (APFPS) sources said Vijayanagar Food and Nutraceuticals Limited is currently procuring close to 1 lakh coconuts per day, which in the coming days would be scaled up to 2 lakh coconuts per day, for extracting coconut water, coconut powder and other by products such as coconut milk. 
 
 At the same time, primary processing centre   at   in Vizianagaram district is operating with a processing capacity of close to 30 tonnes per day. The firm processes the mangoes in hot water treatment and subsequently exports it to Iran.
 
 Confirming the developments to TOI, APFPS CEO YS Prasad said, “The Rs 90 crore project in Srikakulam has already started functioning. They are already conducting the trials and it is expected to be cleared for commercial operations in a couple of days. This plant will require nearly 2 lakh coconuts per day. This will bring a huge revolution in Srikakulam and neighbouring areas as it is one of the major areas involved in cultivation of coconuts. We can now use coconut for multiple purposes including coconut powder and water.” He said close to 300 persons are being employed by the integrated coconut processing centre.
 
 Also, he said, “Hot water treatment is being taken up by the primary processing centre in Vizianagaram. The mangoes after the treatment are exported to Iran. We have huge mango produce, but exports were nominal. We expect exports to get a boost with this primary processing centre.”
