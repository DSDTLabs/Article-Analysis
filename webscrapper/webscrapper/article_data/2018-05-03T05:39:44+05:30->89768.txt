PANAJI: The   commercial branch in Panaji has been defrauded of Rs 39.4 crore and an FIR in the case has been registered by the CBI on Tuesday against the accused. The accused include SBI officials who allegedly colluded with the fraudsters. The FIR states that Ganindu Milk and Milk Products Pvt Ltd applied for a term loan and misappropriated and diverted the funds.

 
 
 The company, which has an unit at   industrial estate, claimed that the loan was for setting up of an ultra heat temperature plant at Tembhurni, Maharashtra.
 
 It was sanctioned Rs 34.2 crore loan in 2011 to set up the plant, but neither was the land acquired nor the plant bought. The complainant SBI official   said the loan amount was fraudulently misappropriated and diverted. The FIR states that SBI officials M P Rajgopalan and Surender Prasad, who were then posted at the bank’s commercial branch in Panaji, colluded with the accused.
 
 “The bank’s interest was totally neglected in processing, pre-sanction inspection, appraisal, disbursal and post-sanction follow-ups, which enabled the borrowers to defraud the bank,” states the FIR.
 
 Accused directors of Ganindu Milk and Milk Products,   and Varsha Shinde, said the plant to be set up will be bought from Shree Prefect-Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd, Palghar, Maharashtra, and accordingly the money was disbursed by the bank to this company. But the FIR states the funds were then “diverted to AMPM Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, and finally misappropriated”.
 
 Salunkhe, Shinde, Rajgopalan, Prasad, AMPM Pvt Ltd, Shree Prefect-Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd and financial consultant Pramod Kumar Surolia of Sidharth Group of Companies have been booked in the case along with unknown others by the CBI.
