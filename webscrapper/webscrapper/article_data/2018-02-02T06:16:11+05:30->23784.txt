BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday paved the way for recognition of academic credentials of students of the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) 2013-14 and 2014-15 batches, by clarifying that its interim order would not come in the way of the government implementing recommendations made by an expert committee. 

 The committee, headed by  , chief secretary of the state, had suggested the government validate as well as recognize markscards of these students and also take up the matter with the chancellor to award degree certificates. It had also asked to ensure that grievances of all students from batches prior to 2013, who have not been given markscards and degrees, are also redressed and students who have not completed their courses of various batches be allowed to complete the same and degrees (non-technical courses) be awarded to them.
 
 On October 27, 2017, the high court had in an interim order asked the authorities not to take any decision on the recommendations without any clarification from the court. The KSOU non-teaching employees union had challenged the constitution of the expert committee.
