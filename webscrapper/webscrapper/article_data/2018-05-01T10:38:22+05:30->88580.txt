CHANDIGARH: The office of the   chief architect is reconsidering the site for a street vendors' market at Manimajra. The chief architect has written to the Modern Housing Complex resident welfare association of   that the office was looking at the proposal. 

 Last month, in a memorandum given to the municipal commissioner, the residents had objected to the finalising of a site around the existing police beat box and stated that if the proposal was implemented, it will create a tremendous problem of traffic congestion and lack of security. In the memorandum, the residents had also stated that   was a desely populated area and already congested, with a market on one side and a primary school on the other.
 
 The site shortlisted for the vending zone is accident-prone area and the coming up of the proposed market will create a bigger traffic mess. The lack of parking space will unleash utter chaos in the area. Another objection that the residents raised was against the proposed removal of the police beat box from the site. The said that since crimes such as snatching had increased in Manimajra, the proposal to take away police deployment will embolden the criminals and only add to the woes of the residents.
