HYDERABAD : After making a strong pitch for the controversial film God, Sex and Truth (GST), both in TV studios and on social media prior to its release on the web, Ram Gopal   has now taken a u-turn on the movie, claiming he is not its director at all.

 Grilled by the Hyderabad police on Saturday, the controversial director said his association with the film was limited to giving the concept to the production house and giving suggestions to the production crew through Skype.
  
  
 While claiming that the film was shot in Poland and the  , Varma is said to have told cyber crime sleuths that it was his choice to select   when he was shown a few photos by the production house. This prompted the police to ask Varma that when he was not the director, why did he suggest the actress   at all.
 
 Police also showed him various interviews he gave to media channels about GST. He was shown links regarding the film on his social media account too. While RGV said he has not taken any remuneration for the film, his replies it is learnt were not convincing enough. His reply to many questions was that a US-based company produced the movie and the video was uploaded in the States. He said he had no idea about the making of the movie.
 
 Interestingly, at the end of the 20-minute first part of the film, the last frame states that the film has been directed by Varma. When the same was brought to his notice, Varma claimed that it was done without his knowledge. When asked about what suggestions he gave through Skype, the director did not give much clarity. He claimed ignorance on some aspects of questioning.
 
 For their part, the police said, “His interviews on TV, and actions related to GST on his social media, will be more clinching than the movie.’’ Following today’s development, cyber crime sleuths are waiting to question technicians and music director   who are associated with GST.
