TUTICORIN: Police suspect that harassment by the usurer might have led to the suicide of a 51-year-old woman and her 25-year-old   in   on Tuesday. The deceased have been identified as   and her son Sahaya   of Thomas Nagar. The duo had hung themselves in their house in the afternoon.

 On receiving information from neighbours the police rushed to the spot and sent the bodies to Tuticorin medical college hospital for post-mortem. Preliminary investigation revealed that Sahaya Raj was working as a cook on contract at the VOC port guest house. He obtained Rs 5 lakh from financier Pradeep and Sathish of the same locality in April 2017.
 
 Police said that Sahaya Raj was repaying the interest but could not continue as promised by him. With the interest going up, the financiers started visiting the house and also picked a quarrel with him. Later, they started pestering him to repay the money. This month Sahaya Raj managed to repay Rs 1 lakh but the financier started putting further pressure on Sahaya Raj and Sahaya Mary.
 
 It is learnt that the financiers had visited their house on Monday night and Tuesday morning demanding money. But the neighbours interfered and asked them to leave. Unable to bear the humiliation and pressure from the money lender, the duo committed ended their lives by hanging. The police were trying to get details pertaining to the money involved and to arrest Sathish.
