SHIMLA: Before the elections, BJP promised to scrap the credit system and semester system under   (RUSA) in colleges of  . As the BJP is yet to take a decision to fulfill its poll promise,  , the partyâ€™s student outfit, is pressing the demand to do away with the semester system. During the assembly elections, BJP accused the then   government of implementing   hastily. 

 RUSA, a Centrally sponsored scheme, was launched in 2013 to provide strategic funding to eligible institutions of higher education. The idea was to improve the quality of state institutions by ensuring conformity to prescribed norms and standards and adopting accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework.
 
 In Himachal Pradesh however, RUSA has remained controversial since its introduction. Sensing resentment among students and teachers, BJP promised its roll-back. Now that the party is in power, the BJP government realises that a roll-back is not that easy. 
 
 In a recent ABVP meeting held in Solan, participants opposed the semester system under RUSA and demanded that the government scrap it. In this, the CPM is also towing the line. 
 
 Before the assembly elections, BJP released its vision document, which is a now a policy document of the state government. In this, the party promised to end choice-based credit system and semester system under RUSA and to introduce the annual examination system.
 
 The BJP government recently gave administrative approval of over Rs 16 crore for construction of a building at Vallabh Government College, Mandi and over Rs 10 crore for   in Mandi district under the RUSA component.
 
 Education minister Suresh Bhardwaj requested the Centre to release funds under RUSA for colleges opened by the previous government without making proper budgetary provisions. 
 
 Sources said the education department is preparing a detailed report on RUSA that will be discussed with the government, after which a decision will be taken by the government.
