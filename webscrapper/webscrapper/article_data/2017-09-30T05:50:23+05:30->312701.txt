New Delhi: Budget carrier   has told   (DIAL) that it is open to shifting entirely from Terminal 1 to T2 and does not want split operations. 

 This is the latest twist in the ongoing tussle over shifting one-third domestic flights of IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir to T2. DIAL has told these three   that their flights to and from Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata will be allowed to operate only from T2 from October-end when the winter schedule starts.
 
 The low-cost carrier, owned by Wadia Group, has only 25 planes in its fleet. It carries out 40   movements in Delhi every day and does not fly on international routes as of now. On the other hand, 141-plane-strong IndiGo and SpiceJet that has a fleet of 55 aircraft operate international flights too. So, they have domestic flights flying out of T1 and foreign ones from T3.
 
 “With a relatively small fleet operating from one terminal alone, GoAir has indicated it is open to shifting fully to T2. IndiGo had refused to shift one-third of its flights to T2 as it finds operating from three terminals — T1, T2 and T3 — unviable. However, DIAL has told both SpiceJet and IndiGo that after October 29, their flights to and from Mumabi, Bengaluru and Kolkata will not be allowed from T1,” said a source.
 
 None of the three low-cost carriers and DIAL commented on the issue.
 
 Like GoAir now, IndiGo had earlier told DIAL that it is open to shifting fully to T2 and will not like to split domestic operations between T1 and T2. “While the capacity of T2 is below IndiGo’s need by 40 lakh passengers per annum…with some terminal modifications for growth, it would provide a far better customer experience than your proposed split operation between T1 and T2… The best option for all of our customers is to find a way for some airline(s) to move their complete operations out of T1 to T2,” IndiGo said in a letter to DIAL CEO I P Rao on August 30.
