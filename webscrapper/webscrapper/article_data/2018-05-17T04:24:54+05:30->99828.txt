NEW DELHI: Students of Delhi University’s Law Faculty have received partial relief on Wednesday from the Delhi high court, which has allowed them to sit for the remainder of the LLB  . The students were detained by the college for failing to meet the required 70% attendance.

 
 Around 447 students were detained by the law   for failing to meet the rules of the Bar Council of India (BCI). A group of 25 students then approached the high court and filed a petition complaining that the faculty was calculating attendance in the college wrongly.
 
 “As per BCI rules, there should be more than 450 classes in a year, but the faculty has only taken over 200,” claimed advocate Himanshu Dhuper, lawyer for the students. 
 
 The court has allowed students to give exams but has not provided interim relief.
