NAGPUR: Though it is likely to get possession of entire   on June 1, the Maharashtra   Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) will require change in land reservation from existing ‘park’ to ‘commercial’ for beginning construction of amusement park-cum-food plaza.

 The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has asked the MahaMetro to consult the   ( ) for user change, which is a lengthy process and is likely to take months.
 
 The NIT in its letter dated May 4 also informed the MahaMetro that the cost of the land will increase to Rs85.92 crore if user changed to commercial. “The 6.47 acres land is reserved for a park in city’s development plan (DP). MahaMetro will have to pay Rs57.28 crore or adjust NIT’s share if land cost is calculated under park category. Ready reckoner value of commercial land is more than that of park,” the NIT said.
 
 Besides NIT, the MahaMetro will also have to pay to   International Ltd which holds the land’s lease till 2021.
 
 The MahaMetro has planned to demolish Krazy Castle and construct Metro rail corridor, station, parking along with amusement park, food plaza and other types of commercial ventures. Commercial activities and creating third party interest on the property are not permissible in case reservation is for park.
 
 For change in reservation, the NMC will have to give   that it will not require the land. The NMC general body will have to give its consent, followed by inviting suggestions and objections on its plan and later hold a hearing. Proposal will be submitted to the state government for change in reservation in the city’s DP. Also, the NMC will have to adjust the reservation of park at another place.
 
 This also raises a question on NIT’s permission to Haldiram Foods for renting out some portion of Krazy Castle for marriage and other types of private functions.
 
 It is also learnt that the NIT is upset as the MahaMetro refused to pay 2% ground rent annually for the land. 
 
 Also, the NIT has demanded the MahaMetro to pay premium of Rs1.93 crore that was supposed to come from Haldiram Foods till 2021. The MahaMetro has also reportedly rejected this demand.
