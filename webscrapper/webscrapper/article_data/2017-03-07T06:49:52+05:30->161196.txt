BEIJING: India should be “more pragmatic and flexible“ to support the multi-billion dollar CPEC project despite sovereignty issues linked to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) as China backs business links between Taiwan and India, a state-run media said on Monday.

 “The   (CPEC) won't affect the status quo of Kashmir dispute“ as China has stated that it should be resolved between India and Pakistan, an article in the staterun   said. The project is an economic plan set to connect China and Pakistan and advance Pakistan's economy and improve the lives of its people, the paper said, adding the investment from Chinese firms and their participation in some architectural construction won't affect the situation of Kashmir either.
 
 “Just like the Taiwan question, Beijing doesn't object any economic links between Taiwan and other countries including India because economic activities won't alter China's sovereignty over the island,“ it said. “Hence, India should be flexible and pragmat ic, and be more open to economic activities in the Kashmir region conducted by Chinese companies,“ it said.
 
 Meanwhile, China is blaming the Indian government of encouraging Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to visit Arunachal Pradesh in the coming weeks in the hope of garnering political advantage from it. A commentary in Global Times, which is controlled by Communist Party , said on Monday , “Leveraging the Dalai Lama issue to undermine Beijing's core interests risks dragging the two countries into a state of hostility.“
