KOCHI: Stephan the ' ' did not foresee such a betrayal by the police that left him holding a cross-all alone-in front of the Bishop's House here on Good Friday. 

 Stephan Martin, dressed as Jesus Christ, was part of a group from the All Kerala Church Act Action Council that held a dharna against the church's dubious land deals on Friday evening.
 
 Police, however, were not impressed since a Way of the Cross procession by devotees was scheduled to pass through the same spot. In a bid to avert a possible confrontation police detained and removed the protesters from the scene, but left Martin in Christ's attire alone.
 
 The police later explained: "How can we arrest Jesus," an officer asked. "It was obvious that they wanted to create a ruckus and even asked us to take the man dressed as Christ into custody. Our personnel moved him aside and stayed with him, before taking the others into preventive custody," he added. Martin stayed for a while before dismantling the cardboard cross and placing it in the boot of a car. "They (the police) didn't even tell me why I was not shifted," he later said, adding that they were demanding the implementation of the Church Act. 
 
 About 30 minutes later, Martin arrived at the Central police station-he had by then changed his dress in the car-and sought bail for the protesters, who included Indulekha Joseph, Alosia Joseph, Joseph Varghese, Joy, Francis, Sebastian CV and  .
 
 "There were two others helping me with the make-up and carrying the cross. We went to the police station together and the other two stood bail for those arrested," he said.
 
 Earlier, the Joint Christian Council, held a Way of the Cross procession as a penance for the 'sins' of Cardinal George Mar Alencherry.
