Vadodara: A forester with Dabhoi forest range was held by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in a reverse trap on Monday for bribing a man for not seeking reply of an RTI application.

 Manilal Vasava had received an RTI application from the complainant, who is a social worker and a teacher, in May this year. According to ACB officials, the complainant had asked for information about the unpaid wages and vouchers of daily workers of forest department.
 
 ACB sources said that Vasava did not pay the wages but used to make fake vouchers and siphon off the money. According to sources, Vasava had siphoned off Rs 50,000. The daily wagers approached the complainant, who filed an RTI application. “Since Vasava did not want to give information, he approached the complainant and offered Rs 10,000 to sign on acknowledgement saying that he had received the reply,” said the official.
 
 On the other hand, the complainant approached the agency and informed them about Vasava’s offer. The ACB sleuths laid a trap and held Vasava when he came to give the bribe money. 
 
 ACB official said that they have video recorded Vasava’s act of offering money and recovered the cash Rs 10,000.
