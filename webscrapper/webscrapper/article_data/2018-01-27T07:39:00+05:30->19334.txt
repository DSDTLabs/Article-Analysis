LUDHIANA:   (AAP) on Thursday protested outside Ludhiana police commissioner’s office against the arrest of AAP Youth leader and ward No.69 president Gurkaran Singh Tinna, alleging that he was implicated by the police in a false case.

 “Tinna has been implicated by the police in a false case under sections 107/151 of the IPC, just for raising his voice against illegal encroachment by the security staff of a powerful Akali leader on a public park in Model Town Extension Block-A. After registering the false case in Model Town police station, Tinna was arrested and later released on bail,” said senior AAP leaders — state general secretary Ahbaab Singh Grewal, spokesperson Darshan Singh Shankar, and district president Daljit Singh Grewal — who strongly condemned the registration of the false case against Tinna, following ‘pressure’ from Congress and Akali leaders, keeping in view the coming MC elections. They alleged that the false case was registered to harass the probable candidate from ward No.69.
 
 AAP leaders demanded that the false case be withdrawn at the earliest, otherwise the party would take the matter to the public, and be forced to hold demonstrations. They also warned that the ruling party would not be allowed to misuse power during elections. Tinna said the SAD leader’s security staff was using a public park illegally, and causing harassment to residents of the area.
