LUCKNOW: The objective of handing over the city’s   to NGOs to ensure their   remains defeated as even those homes are in poor condition.

 The   (NULM) guidelines state that a visitor should get a clean bed, blanket, drinking water, toilet and a kitchen with fuel and utensils in a shelter home. Because of its inability to run all shelter homes on its own, LMC had handed over nine of them to NGOs this year. These NGOs will get Rs 6 lakh per annum from the Centre for this work.
 
 However, a reality check of these homes revealed that their condition was not good. In Aminabad, there was no electricity in the toilet despite charging visitors Rs 10 per head for stay.
 
 Its manager Arpit told TOI, “It’s in NULM guidelines that we can charge Rs 10 for bed, blanket, pillow, RO water and toilet facility for 12 hours.” However, the rooms were not clean.
 
 Despite NULM mandating to provide beds to the destitute, at the Laxman Mela grounds home, people were sleeping on political banners and plastic sheets. In Jiamau and Charbagh homes, beds did not have sheets or blankets.
