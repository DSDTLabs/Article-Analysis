   comes out in a dress at the pooja, but   takes her by her hand and goes inside. He comes inside the room and locks the door. Uma asks Kanak not to get scared of him and tells her that a married woman does not wear such clothes in their house. Masi sa comes to their room and shouts at Kanak, explaining her that she is the luckiest of all to be in their house. Kanak replies to her in anger saying that she feels like a bird in a cage.
 
  When Kanak refuses to dress up according to them, Masi sa tries to lure her by showing the jewellery that has been kept for her. She explains to Kanak that they have a lot to give to her and she is refusing all this, just then Uma Shankar asks Masi sa to stop explaining any further.
  
  Kanak realises that Kanak sweet shop's papers would be kept with the jewellery, so she rushes outside and tells them that she is ready to wear the clothes that they have given, but doesn't want to wear such heavy jewellery, instead she insists them on showing her something else.
  
  
 
  
  Kanak apologises to Masi sa, but the latter feels that it is because of the jewellery that she is doing all this. Masi sa opens the cupboard for her and asks her to pick whatever she likes, but Kanak has her eyes on the property papers.
