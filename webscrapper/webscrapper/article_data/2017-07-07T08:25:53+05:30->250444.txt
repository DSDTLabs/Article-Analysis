AHMEDABAD: Bariatric surgery to reduce excess fat cannot be always categorized as a cosmetic surgery; morbid obesity is a disease which leads to several health complications as well, a consumer court has held. 

 The court directed the insurance company to pay mediclaim of Rs 3.24 lakh with 9% interest to a morbidly obese 67-year old woman who went under the scalpel for weight loss three years ago.
 
 Vadodara-based Pratima Parikh, weighing 124 kg, underwent robotic laparoscopic surgery for morbid obesity in a   hospital in 2014. Though she was covered under a mediclaim policy by  , the insurance company rejected her claim for Rs 3.24 lakh surgery expense citing the surgery falls under the category of cosmetic surgery and cannot be reimbursed.
 
 Parikh's husband Vitthalbhai moved the consumer dispute redressal forum in Vadodara challenging the rejection on ground that   considers bariatric surgery as 'gastrointestinal non-cosmetic surgery' under the rubrics of surgical gastroenterology and not a plastic surgery.
