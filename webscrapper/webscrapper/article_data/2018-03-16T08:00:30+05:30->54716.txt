BHOPAL: The policeman accused of helping students cheat during board examination in   was suspended on Thursday. 

 A video of him talking to someone through a window in the exam hall, and handing over some papers had gone viral on Wednesday.
 
 He was identified as Sri   of 13th Battalion, Special Armed Force (SAF), posted in Kampoo, Gwalior. A preliminary inquiry found him guilty of helping students cheat, say sources. The probe by Betul collector found that Singh passed chits to students through a window at Utkrisht Vidyalaya in   tehsil of Betul. 
 
 
 
 
 He has been identified and put under suspension. He will face a departmental inquiry as well. The video was shot by a local resident who is yet unidentified,” said   board of secondary education (MPPSE) chairman S R Mohanty. 
 
 The inquiry found that Singh also had a mobile phone with him. “It appears he was not on examination duty,” Mohanty added. The video shows Singh, who is in uniform, standing near a window of the school, taking out chit from his pocket and rolling it, probably to pass it to a student sitting, say officials. He then slips his hand under his shirt and pulls out a mobile and looks for something on it. 
 
 The incident puts a question mark on MPPSE’s claim of ‘strict’ security measures, more so since the centre was identified as among the sensitive ones.
