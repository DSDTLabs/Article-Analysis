The young diva,   is all set to make her debut in July this year. Her upcoming movie 'Dhadak' is a Hindi remake of the Marathi blockbuster, Sairat. While we all wait for the big movie release, Janhvi has already impressed everyone with her style, poise and beauty. Yesterday, the actress was seen at the private screening of 'Veere Di Wedding', which also casts her cousin sister, Sonam Kapoor and no prizes for guessing she looked stunning!

 
 For the screening, Janhvi happily posed for the shutterbugs with her daddy, Boney Kapoor. She stole the show with her eye-catching flared jeans. The jeans featured triangle-shaped patchwork in different shades of blue. Letting the jeans play her look, she styled it with a white crop top and yellow-tone heels. Adding a pop of colour was her black and pink bag from Chanel. 
 She let her hair down, while her skin was glowing usual. Going for the fresh-faced look, she just applied a bright pink lip colour.

 The young fashionista is a big fan of statement jeans. Our favourite look of Janhvi from the past is the one where she wore an embroidered jeans from Alice and Olivia. For a family trip in Los Angeles, Janhvi wore the statement jeans featuring colourful embroidery and mirror paillette. She styled the wide-legged jeans with a white crop shirt. The embroidery jeans also come with a heavy price tag of Rs 56,000 approximately!
