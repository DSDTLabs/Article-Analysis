GHAZIABAD: A 65-year-old woman fell to her death from the balcony of her 20th floor   on Thursday morning. The body of Savita Kapoor was found in a pool of blood by society guards at 2.30am. While the police describe it as a case of suicide, her family members believe it was an accident.

 “Around 2.30am, I got a call from a guard informing me that the body of a woman was lying near B-tower of the apartment. I rushed to the spot and saw a body lying in a pool of blood. The face was not recognisable,” said Alok Tripathy, a resident.
 
 “I then sent for residents in B-tower to identify the woman. Half an hour later, an elderly man named Shashi Kapoor identified the body to be that of his wife Savita,” he said. Savita lived with her husband and son Saurav Kapoor in Cloud 9 Apartment. Saurav, who works with an IT company, was at work when the incident occurred. “My mother and father were sleeping in the master bedroom while two aunts, who had arrived a few days ago, were in the adjacent room,” said Saurav, adding: “We have no idea how and when she went to balcony and how the incident happened. I suspect that my mother accidentally fell.” The police said no suicide note had been found. Vineet Kumar, chowki in-charge, Kanawani, said: “There was a chair in the balcony and prima facie it appears that she had stood on the chair and jumped off. During investigation, it had also come to light that Savita was being treated for depression.” 
 
 Saurav admitted that his mother was being treated for depression. “Nearly 20 years ago, my mother had suffered a paralytic attack and recovered over time. However, she fell into depression and was on medication. But I still maintain that she accidentally fell off the balcony due to her paralytic history. She could not have climbed the chair on her own and jumped off,” said Saurav. Meanwhile, the police have recorded the statements and are awaiting the postmortem report to ascertain whether it was a suicide.
