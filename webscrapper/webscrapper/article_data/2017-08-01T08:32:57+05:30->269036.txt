BENGALURU:  , a   from The Netherlands, is as adept at creating magic on stage with her ballet moves as she is at grappling with phantoms in the brain. The assistant professor from   proved as much during her solo ballet performance at the   (NIAS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), here on Monday evening.
Marieke, 36, came to India in connection with a study, but when she got a chance to fill the stage with her passion, she did not let it go.
 
 Speaking about her work as a neuroscientist, Marieke told TOI: “I focus on what happens to one's mind when one gets distracted; what is a healthy state of the brain and what is not and also what happens to the human brain under depression.“
 
 Marieke revealed that she never wanted to become a neuroscientist. Her dream was to become a ballerina, something that she has been chasing for the past 25 years.“A professional ballet dancer needs to start classes at the age of 8. However, I began a little late at 11, preventing me from taking up ballet professionally. But I am happy now as I am able to perform well even at the age of 36,“ she said, while hinting that she might return to the city in October to perform again.
 
 Marieke takes four class es every week and trains rig orously to keep herself fit. She has won several awards for choreography .
 
 On Monday, Marieke performed a few basic steps of ballet and danced to excerpts from Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and La Bayadere.
