HUBBALLI: Chief Minister   on Sunday said that he will once again write to his Goa counterpart,  , to find a solution to the vexed Mahadayi water-sharing issue at the earliest. 

  Speaking to reporters at Hubballi Airport, Siddaramaiah said that the state government is putting all efforts to resolve the Kalasa-Banduri issue. 
 
 The CM was critical of the Centre for neglecting the drought relief fund. "We demanded Rs 4,700 crore fund for crop loss, but the Union government released only Rs 1,700 crore. We have already distributed Rs 1,003-crore compensation to farmers. A survey is being conducted for the remaining funds and we will distribute the compensation amount shortly," he said.
 
 Siddaramaiah mocked the   and JD(S) for claiming that they will win 150 seats in the assembly elections next year. "But the state has only 224 assembly constituencies. I don't know how they will get 150 seats each," he said, exuding confidence that the   will regain power in the state.
 
 Reacting to the statement of BJP's   incharge,   that Congress leaders will soon be imprisoned, Siddaramaiah said that going to jail is the saffron party's culture. "Many BJP leaders have already gone to jail for their misdeeds and many more would follow them in the future," he said.
