Thane: With the exam season for class XII students fast approaching, psychologists and   are being flooded with calls from students looking for solutions for examination jitters. 

 Varsha Singhvi, a city-based psychologist, said, “While I usually get calls from students appearing for competitive exams, the numbers of class XII students and even class X students have risen considerably this month. Most of them face similar symptoms of stress, including lack of sleep, fatigue through the day, loss of appetite and worry.”
 
 Singhvi added, “Being this close to exams, these students need to plan revision for each subject in advance, eat properly, get enough sleep and take breaks by spending half an hour with friends or watching TV or just listening to music between revisions for rejuvenation.” 
 
 Mental health experts said that stress comes from and unrealistic expectation the students set for themselves or by others. Paras Sharma, program coordinator at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) helpline – iCall, which has also been receiving many such calls, said, “The academic world has become competitive today and this competition has given rise to a new genre of youngsters who push themselves beyond their limits to achieve their goals. For some, however, these pressures are still external. The problem arises when these expectations are unrealistic and the students start worrying as they are unable to reach the goal. Many try studying for eight to 10 hours at a stretch, which is not good.”
 
 Sharma added that these situations make them go through mixed emotions like, disappointment, sadness, anger and frustration. This could lead to vulnerability where they could go into depression and have violent or suicidal tendencies.
 
 Being ambitious is good, but pushing one’s body and mind to impracticable levels has an adverse effect on their well-being in the long run
