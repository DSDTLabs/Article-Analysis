JAIPUR: As the infighting increases between the   leaders over their demand for quota, a faction of the community led by former Delhi MLA   on Thursday asked the state government to junk the agreement signed with   on May 19, and gave a call for a peaceful agitation from August 1 if their demands are not met.

 
 Speaking at a press conference, Bidhuri said that if ruling BJP government fails to implement its commitment of giving quota to Gujjars, then a nationwide agitation will be conducted and he will meet senior leaders to make them apprise of the trials that the community has been going though for past nine years. “A peaceful agitation will be organized from August 1 if our demands are not met,” he said.
 
 “We are simply requesting the BJP to implement the promises it made during 2013 assembly elections. The manifesto clearly promised a quota for us,” Bidhuri said.
 
 He also chided   for being too susceptible to the present dispensation and compromising the community’s interest for his own personal ambitions. “I don’t know what logic went behind to only call Bainsla faction for the meeting on May 19. He can no longer mobile the community.”
 
 Bidhuri said that Gujjar would not accept the May 19 agreement which was signed by the ministers and Bainsla.
 
 “The May 19 agreement will forever end the state government's commitment to give five per cent reservation within the 50 per cent limit as laid down by the  , this is unacceptable to us and it should be annulled with immediate effect,” he said.
 
 The Gujjar leaders led by Bainsla and the state government had reached an agreement after several-hour-long talks. A 16-point agreement was signed following which the Gujjar leaders had agreed to call off their agitation.
