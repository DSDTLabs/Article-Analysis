CHANDIGARH: The PGI director's office has issued directions to its faculty, nurses, resident doctors and other hospital staff to exercise "utmost diligence, promptness, respect and empathy while rendering services to patients and other attendants at the hospital." 

 Last month, a decision was taken by the institute to teach resident doctors how to deal with patients politely, particularly the elderly. "There is a need to be more emphatic towards patients. We are known because of patients and should be considerate despite the patient rush. We shall have regular orientation classes for this purpose," said Dr  , director, PGI. 
 
 Almost 8,000 patients throng the PGI   
 
 The official note stated: "All services in relation to patient care during his/her stay in PGI, including services to be provided in case of death of patients, be rendered with utmost sensitivity and professionalism." Experts said lack of humanities and social sciences in medical curriculum has been one of the key reasons for rude behaviour of staff. "One does not feel the pain if one is exposed to hardcore science. Also, students enter medicine in India soon after Class XII unlike the West, where students opt for the profession after graduation. They are more mature and have studied social sciences or humanities," said Dr  , former dean, PGI.
