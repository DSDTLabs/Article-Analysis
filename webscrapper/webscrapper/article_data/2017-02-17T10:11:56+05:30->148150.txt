Priyanka Chopra, who has charmed the wild wild west with her acting prowess and darling ways, is surely in the best phase of her life. The actress who has made her mark in Hollywood is doing absolute justice to it with her power-packed performance.

 While still juggling her shoots for ‘Quantico’ and ‘Baywatch’, the actress makes it a point to spend time with friends and catch up with them.
 
 And guess who visited her in between shots recently? It was none other than her good-friend and ace fashion designer  .
 Manish, who was in New York for some work commitments, dropped by the sets to meet the actress and also shared a selfie with her and captioned it, “#NewYork with the #incredible #TheOneAndOnly@priyankachopra.”
