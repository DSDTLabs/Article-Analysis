HYDERABAD: Overcome by what appeared to be a sense of complete disbelief, the aged father of Fasahat Ali sat still like a rock at   police station on Tuesday, hours after his youngest son was killed. Even as other members of the family wailed in despair around him,   didn't move an inch or shed a tear. From the contours of his face though, the excruciating pain was more than evident. 

 "As soon as I got a call, I rushed to the police station with Fasahat's father. The first thing we saw when we got here was the body," said Khalid, his maternal uncle, in between making calls to other relatives and friends to inform them about the incident. 
 
 "Fasahat has two elder brothers - one is in the US and the other in Saudi Arabia. Both have been informed and are expected to join the family shortly," Khalid said, adding that the 20-year-old's mother hadn't been informed just yet. 
 
 "We initially told her that Fasahat was critical. Maybe as the day progresses we will have to break the news to her. We couldn't do it immediately as she suffers from hypertension apart from many other health issues," Khalid said. 
 
 Also present at the police station were Fasahat's cousins and the family's neighbours from  , in Banjara Hills.
