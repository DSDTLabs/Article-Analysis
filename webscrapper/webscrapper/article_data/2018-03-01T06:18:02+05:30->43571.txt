 The IMD has given a forecast for heat wave conditions at isolated places in Mumbai and the state for the next 48 hours. Meanwhile, Mumbai recorded an AQI (air quality index) of 241 on Wednesday, similar to that in recent days; AQI 201-300 is harmful for sensitive people.
 
 “Hot weather like what is being experienced now doesn’t usually prevail at Maharashtra’s coastal stations because cool sea breeze tends to moderate temperatures. The current heat wave, with some coastal stations seeing a temperature departure from normal by 5-6 degrees, is due to a change in wind patterns, because of which sea breeze has been blocked,” said an IMD official.
 
 In Mumbai, temperatures started showing an unusual rise from Sunday onwards. Ajay Kumar, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said, “There is a trough in the lower level from southeast Arabian Sea to Maharashtra’s coast, owing to which the winds are easterly, bringing in warm air.”
