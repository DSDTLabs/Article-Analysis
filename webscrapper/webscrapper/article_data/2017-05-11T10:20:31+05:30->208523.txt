VISAKHAPATNAM: Even though Vizag’s pharma cluster is doing well, setting up of exclusive clusters for chemicals and intermediates is needed, director general of Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmaexcil), R Uday Bhaskar told   during his visit to the port city.

 He further said this will reduce heavy dependence on imports of chemicals from China and other countries to manufacture drugs. “Vizag has several big pharma companies and manufacturing units like Eisai and   which are export-oriented. Srikakulam and   also have the potential to be identified as pharma hub. But they all lack exclusive parks or clusters for chemicals and intermediates. These are required in the manufacture of Active Pharma Ingredients (APIs) or bulk drug formulations,” he added.
 
 In the absence of clusters for chemicals and intermediates, India is largely dependent on imports especially from China and Europe, Bhaskar said. 
 
 “Even some antibiotics cannot be made unless these are imported. For instance, Ciprofloxacin acid is an intermediate product which is required in manufacturing Ciprofloxacin,” he added.
 
 “However, it would be difficult for individual companies to come up with chemicals and intermediate manufacturing units due to land and environmental permission issues, Bhaskar said, adding that the government should come up with industrial policies that provide incentives to pharma companies for setting up these units.
 
 “Such clusters should be set up in the outskirts away from habitation and on land that are not suitable for cultivation. The effluent treatment plant should also be in place as these clusters would emit considerable amount of effluents and residues,” Bhaskar pointed out.
