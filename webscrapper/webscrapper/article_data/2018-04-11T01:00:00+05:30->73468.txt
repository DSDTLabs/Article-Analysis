 has a busy year ahead, with two 
  lined up for release. He says, “I’m working on ' ' and ' '. The previous installments of both these films have fared well and hence, expectations are already high. So, there is a lot of pressure.” 

 Having said that, Riteish also believes that any film with strong content, if released at the right time, will do well. It really doesn’t matter if they are part of a popular franchise. “The genre of the film could make a difference to its box-office prospects. Comedies like 'Total Dhamaal' and 'Housefull 4' have a better chance to succeed, but at the end of the day, it’s about getting your content and release date right. If those parameters are in place, the film will work well,” he says. 
 
 That’s not all. Riteish Deshmukh, who made his debut in Marathi cinema with ' ' in 2014, is all set for his second outing in the language. Riteish will soon begin work on ' ', which was first announced in 2015. The film, however, was later put on the back burner because of creative issues. 
 
 The actor, who is also an acclaimed producer in 
  industry, says, “Mauli' is going on floors soon. Sometimes, what happens after a success like 'Lai Bhaari' is that one tries too hard to figure out what one wants to do next. You have already set a benchmark and you don’t want to slip. But then, it doesn’t always work out the way you planned. Fortunately, in Mauli’s case, we got the film back on track.” 
 
 '
 ', an action drama directed by Aditya Sarpotdar and written by Kshitij Patwardhan, will be produced by Riteish’s production house, Mumbai Film Company.
