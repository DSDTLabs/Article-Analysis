COIMBATORE: Coimbatore district, which had been reeling under temperatures varying between 35 degree Celsius and 37 degree Celsius for the past two weeks, received thundershowers on Tuesday night. 

 The district recorded 7mm of rainfall at the   station and 0.2mm rain at the Peelamedu station on Tuesday. 
 
 “There was heavy thunderstorms and lightning, but the actual rainfall received was not to the same extent,” said assistant professor at the Agro Climate Research Station at TNAU, G Dheebakaran. 
 
 The district received rain thanks to the movement of a trough from Marathwada in Maharashtra towards Kerala. “Since the trough is moving towards Kerala, Coimbatore and other districts close to Kerala are receiving some scattered rainfall,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather Services.
 
 “Such large thunderstorms are common when ground temperatures are high like above 30 degree Celsius,” said Palawat. “It is because convective clouds form in the afternoon and evening hours and rise almost 8 km to 10 km above the ground,” he said.
 
 Weather experts said the relief would last another 48 hours.   would be warmer than usual, they added.
