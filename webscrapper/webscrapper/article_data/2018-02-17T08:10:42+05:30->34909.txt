PUNE: The   police on Thursday arrested a 47-year-old man for stalking his neighbour’s 16-year-old daughter for the last five months.

 Frustrated by the man’s harassment, the girl on Thursday complained to her mother, who immediately approached the police and lodged the complaint.
 
 An officer from the Mundhwa police said that the complainant and the suspect were neighbours. The suspect had been stalking the girl since September last year. He used to follow her while she used to come from school and while going out for tuitions.
 
 “Initially the girl ignored the man’s advances. However, she told her mother about him when he started harassing her on a daily basis,” the officer said.
