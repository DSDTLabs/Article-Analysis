AHMEDABAD: The staff at the   railway station — the only station in   with all-woman personnel — is confident about living up to the expectations that the unique initiative has set up. The women’s professionalism has been acclaimed by passengers, who say that the station has been running smoothly. But some security concerns have been raised because the women who manage the reservation counters have to work till 10pm at a small station which becomes deserted after 9pm.

 Ahmedabad division officials said the commercial department has deployed 23 commercial clerks, three operating staff (stationmaster and point-persons), and 10 railway protection force (RPF) personnel at the Maninagar railway station. In all, 36 frontline staffers at the station are women
 
 The station superintendent,  , said: “We were earlier posted with men who were always trying to establish that they had an upper hand. But now it is an opportunity for us to prove ourselves. We are happy that we are achieving something.”
 
 As for those who have to work late, the presence of RPF is reassuring.  , a passenger, said that earlier it took 30-odd minutes for him to get a ticket. He said these days he has a ticket in his hand in 20-odd minutes. “Usually, the men need time to chew gutka or smoke,”   said.
