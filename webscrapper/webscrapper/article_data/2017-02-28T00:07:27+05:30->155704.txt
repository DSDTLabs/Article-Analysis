Aurangabad: The Beed police have asked an officer of the rank of deputy deputy superintendent of police to monitor the case involving seizure of Rs 9.5 lakh in scrapped currencies.

 Police, along with the income tax department, are carrying out a parallel probe into the recovery of the demonetised notes from Shaikh Zameer (25), a resident of Naregaon in Aurangabad city, on Friday night.
 
 The cash is suspected to be a part of Rs 1 crore in demonetised notes belonging to a city trader who was allegedly robbed by Zameer and his accomplices.
 
 Zameer was rounded up by a team of Chaklamba police while he was driving a car with the demonetised currency notes. The car was heading towards Gevrai from Shevgaon of Ahmednagar district.
 
 Gevrai’s sub-divisional police officer ( ) Rajkumar Chaphekar said, “The case is serious and we are investigating all the possible angles. We are also investigating if there is involvement of cops in the case.”
 
 He said the police are cross checking the veracity of the claims made by Zameer and that things may be clear after his two accomplices are detained for questioning.
 
 Meanwhile, Aurangabad police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Monday said, “The city police are looking into the matter as the primary report suggests involvement of people who should not have got involved in such unethical practices.”
 
 Police source said that all those whose names are cropping in the case have gone underground and switched off their mobile phones.
