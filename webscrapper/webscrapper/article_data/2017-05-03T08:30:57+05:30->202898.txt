NEW DELHI:   Fitch has retained India's credit rating, citing weak fiscal position and a tough business environment, ignoring government's repeated pitch for an upgrade.

 Although the agency acknowledged various positives — stronger growth, grip over inflation and crucial reforms such as an insolvency law and   — it put a lot of weight on implementation. "Impact of the reform programme on investment and real   will depend on how it is implemented and the extent to which the government continues its strong drive to improve the still-weak business environment," the agency said in a statement. In addition, it said that India's fiscal position remained weak and it was not clear if the government would accept the  's formula and cap overall debt at 60% of gross domestic product.
 
 The government has repeatedly pitched for an upgrade and questioned the stance adopted by agencies, arguing that several economies in Europe enjoyed higher ratings despite weaker finances.
 
 Fitch seemed to counter that by saying, "India's economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the `BBB' range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator," it said.
