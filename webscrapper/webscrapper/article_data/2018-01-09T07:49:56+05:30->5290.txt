CHENNAI: IIT-M research scholars at the fag end of their projects and those who have completed five years are protesting a circular that asked them to leave their rooms and move into shared accommodation from Saturday. 

 The scholars, who have exceeded the official time limit given for their research programme, are requesting not to be moved out since they are on the verge of completing their work.
 
 Scholars (MS/PhD), who staged a   outside the director's office on Monday, said their requests to authorities to not make them shift had gone unanswered. 
 
 A scholar told TOI that the decision is being   and they were, in a way, being punished for not being able to complete their projects on time. Students said shifting now would cause “academic and mental pressure” as they are now finishing their projects.
 
 The scholares also plan to continue protests during Saarang, the annual cultural festival of IIT Madras that begins on Wednesday. 
 
 Besides, a petition started by the scholars on change.org is trying to gain support for allowing them to stay in the allotted rooms they currently reside in. Students claimed that the alternate accommodation provided was too small to be shared by two people. 
 
 “MS and PhD programmes are explicitly stated to be not bound by duration. So a few months delay in completion of work should be considered legitimate,” the petition stated. The petition has so far received 1,438 signatures and will be delivered to director, dean and office of the hostel management at IIT-Madras.
 
 IIT-M director   said, “We understand their problem but we have to accommodate other students as well. So sometimes scholars will need to adjust with sharing after some years,” he said.
