KOCHI: “I have seen that people were more curious about my caste when I left the column blank in my applications for job interviews. Yet I have survived. So, I want my child also to live without being tagged to religion or caste,” said a highly placed professional, who didn’t want to be named.

 Many couples who have made the choice of not revealing their caste or religion, felt there was nothing ‘earth shattering’ in their decision and it does not warrant celebration. Many others have decided that their children could take a call later.
 
 Rubin D Cruz, assistant editor at  , said those who might have decided to drop the religious or caste identity would be from a privileged background. Though it is a welcome decision, it doesn’t mean that these identities have become non-existent for them, he said.
 
 “Though I don’t believe in the concepts of religion and caste, I have attached the caste name in my son’s application. I am a Christian and my wife is a Hindu. But my son is not being brought up as a Hindu or a Christian. We have given him the freedom to choose whatever he wants,” said D’Cruz.
 
 D’Cruz said the problem is that irrespective of whether you choose to mention caste/religion or not their importance cannot be undermined as one must face questions related to them in some stage of life. “It is not going to make any impact as it is rooted in our society,” he said.
 
 Shylaja P Ambu, theatre artist and folk singer said she wants her daughter to grow up as casteless and religion-less citizen. “If I keep caste, she will be eligible for some reservations in jobs. However, I feel that reservation must be based on financial status. People who got benefits of reservation for 2-3 generations are still using it for their next generation. I think that is unfair,” she said adding that her daughter, a fifth standard student, would be given the freedom to decide once she is mature enough.
