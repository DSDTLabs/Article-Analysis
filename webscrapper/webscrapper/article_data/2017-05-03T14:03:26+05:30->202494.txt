BENGALURU: AIADMK leader   moved out of the cell she was sharing with fellow convict J Ilavarasi and is now housed in a separate cell at Central Prison,  , a source said. 

 Sasikala and Ilavarasi, who were convicted in the disproportionate assets case, shared cell No. 2 since February when they surrendered after the   upheld their conviction. A week ago,   chose to move out to cell No. 4, the source confirmed.
 
 With a sharp dip in the number of visitors allowed to meet her, Sasikala prefers to spend most of her time in the cell. Earlier, she would frequently meet visitors in the admission room or other offices, resulting in the prison authorities clamping down on the movement of other inmates, for security considerations. She has stopped her walks in the corridors too, sources added.
 
 “Whenever she came out of her cell and headed to the office and admission room where she usually met her visitors, the entire corridor would be cordoned off. Most of the police officials who were deployed to guard the visitors’ room or other inmates, were shifted for Sasikala’s duty, making it difficult for other inmates to meet their relatives and friends. Now, everything is returning to normal. We can see that there is a normal flow of visitors,” the source added.
 
 Once dusk sets in, swarming mosquitoes invading the cells is another thing the once-powerful neta of   has to contend with. “Last week, she got a new mosquito net which is quite big. Sasikala is often seen having her dinner sitting inside the net. She watches Tamil movies more than news channels,” a source said.
 
 
 
 In the mornings, Sasikala keeps herself busy reading Tamil newspapers and magazines in her cell, a prison source said. They reach her through post and Sasikala buys Tamil magazines available in the library. “She reads dailies, tabloids, weekly and fortnightly magazines. Sasikala carefully goes through articles written about her, and the latest political developments,” sources added.
