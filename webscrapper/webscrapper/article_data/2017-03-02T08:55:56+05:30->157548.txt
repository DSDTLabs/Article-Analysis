CHARMINAR: The 200,000-member strong  , which shares a history of 400 years with Hyderabad, is all set to usher in one of the most awaited festivals on their cultural calendar -Holi. 

 “Diwali and Holi are the most important festivals for us. While there will be a mega programme held within the   premises, the festival is likely to be celebrated in a more intimate manner at multiple gatherings organised by Marwari communities in each area.After Holi comes Gangaur, where women of the community carry out a procession in  ,“ said Sohanlal Kadel, an insurance broker who has been living in Hyderabad for over 50 years now. Apart from flamboyant celebrations, members of the community are also known for their business acumen. Their large-scale presence in Hyderabad's trading sector is tough to not notice. According to Kadel, ever since community members began to migrate from Rajasthan and parts of Haryana nearly four centuries ago, Marwaris have made a foray into various industries from textiles to education. Rough estimates suggest people from the community, at present, own as many as 20,000 stores across the twin cities, around 500 jewellery stores in the heart of the city and a few well-known hospitals, including the Mahavir Hospital & Research Centre,  .
 
 “There is no industry or trade that Marwaris in Hyderabad have not ventured into, be it education, healthcare, software or hardware. However, the way the community interacts has changed, over time. People have become less active, when it comes to attending large social gatherings. With the city constantly expanding in various directions, community gatherings are no longer a close-knit affair,"said Srikishan Badruka, whose family migrated to Hyderabad from Nagaur district of Rajasthan more than 100 years ago.The same family also founded the   and Arts.
