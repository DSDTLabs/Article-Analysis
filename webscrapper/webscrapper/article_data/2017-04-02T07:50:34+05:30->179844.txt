 I am only one day old in the commission and am trying to familiarise myself with its functioning. But I will definitely try to introduce a system, which will have zero scope for corrupt practices. I will also ask for more manpower, if need be.
 
 
 
 Freeing the BSSC of corruption is a priority. I am currently focusing on sorting out the pending issues as the chairmanâ€™s post had been lying vacant for the last two months. We are also working on the compliance of a Patna high   related to the pending results of examinations conducted for appointment of agriculture coordinators.
 
 
  Certain exams, including the ones for appointment of ANMs and clerical staff, are pending.. Or, their results are awaited. I am yet to go through the details, but we will first dispose of them. Maybe, we will take a call on fresh examinations for clerical recruitments only after the conclusion of the ongoing police investigations into the alleged scam.
 
 
  I have heard about the announcement, but a formal communication in this regard is awaited. It is certainly a welcome move as it will purge the examination system of the loose ends that create scope for corrupt practices.
 
  
  I will not make a comment on it. It is a matter pertaining to the association and I am speaking to you as the BSSC chairman.
