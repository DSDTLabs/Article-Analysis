BENGALURU: As a cyclist-techie from Bengaluru gets ready for his   at Adoni in Andhra Pradesh, what mode of transport can a group of his cyclist friends think of? Cycle, of course! 

 When members of   (GGGC) were discussing how to attend the wedding of  , team leader Go Green Rao suggested bus and train. When he added cycle as an option, it struck a chord with six members — Siddalinga Swamy, Prasad Sadashiv, Shashidhar, Sunil Kumar, Amar and Sridhar.
 
 The group of six seasoned cyclists, all in the 35-45 age group, will start at 4pm on Friday and cover 400km in about 24 hours to reach Adoni on the eve of the wedding. Reddy, who has been a regular at GGGC group rides for the past four years, will tie the knot with Meghana on Sunday (April 1). 
 
 According to group leader Swamy, a software engineer employed with Amazon, they will meet and greet the newlyweds and ride to nearby Mantralaya before returning to Bengaluru. GGGC has dedicated the mega ride to the couple.
 
 On what made them choose cycle as the transport mode, Swamy said: “We all ride on weekends. So we thought of cycling all the way to wish the cyclist-groom and his wife. I’m sure the couple will remember this unique gift for a lifetime.”
 
 Rao said it’s heartening to see members of the “GoGreen family” going places. This is one of the many long rides that GGGC members will embark on. “Take Swamy for instance. He started with 5-10km. Today, he is ready to ride 1,000km,” he added.
 
 Seven other members will take bus or train to attend the wedding. GGGC members who are not attending the wedding will go on an 80km endurance ride to Bidadi on Sunday morning. It has been dedicated to Reddy.
