CHANDIGARH: Drowning in  , the entrance of a residential park in Sector 40-D next to   is hard to cross without covering your nose.

 Outside of the park's railing lies a heap of unattended waste at for almost three weeks now. The nearby residents have to bear the stench all day. Over months, the pile has accumulated vegetable and fruit peels, rotten leftovers, dry leaves and twigs, plastic bags, decayed paper, and discarded packets. “This is the first scene before our eyes in the morning when my husband and I come over for a walk. The garbage should be cleared,” said a housewife who lives across the street.
 
 The filth, which has started entering the park, bothers the visitors. “This entrance of the park remains choked with garbage. It spoils our mood but we don't know whom to ask for rectification,” said  , a regular park visitor.
 
 Several residents from the block said many people from the neighbourhood littered the park. “They dump their household waste at the spot after dark. Even though the roads are cleaned on a regular basis, this spot has remained dirty consistently. The safai karamcharis clean the place, be it at their own pace, yet the garbage keeps collecting back? That is either a mystery or the work of nearby residents,” said  , said a senior citizen.
