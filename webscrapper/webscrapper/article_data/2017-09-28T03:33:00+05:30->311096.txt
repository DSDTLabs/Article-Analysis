Panaji:   and archaeology minister, Vijai Sardesai met chief minister, Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday over digitization of all archives besides construction of a new state-of-the-art building solely for preserving historic documents.

 “Goa is, I think, one of the oldest archives in Asia. Our archives have a lot of value and they need to be preserved carefully. We want to go in for digitization,” Sardesai, who also holds town and country planning portfolio, said.
 
 Directorate of archives and archaeology has already scanned the birth and death records of all the eleven talukas from 1914 to 1970, and also the records like ‘Documentos Para Viagem, Captain of Ports and Land Records’ of Bardez, Bicholim and Ilhas.
 
 Digitization of archival documents was just one of the several issues pertaining to his portfolios, Sardesai discussed at a scheduled meeting with the CM.
 
 Given the delay in completion of the South Goa district hospital, Sardesai stressed that GSIDC should complete the project as soon as possible. He said being the main public hospital, the government need to ensure that proper facilities and trained manpower are provided there. He also said that the staff would have to be trained in soft skills.
 
 During the deliberation, which was held after the cabinet meeting, the Goa Forward Party (GFP) president also discussed the need for allocation of land to set up floriculture estates in Goa, which can help create employment. 
 
 Sardesai also brought up the issue of reviving posts in the agriculture department, which have lapsed over time. “The department has been appointing staff on ad hoc basis for some years and now their services need to be confirmed,” he said.
 
 A discussion was held on the duties of the three new chief town planners and the need for amending the existing Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act 1974, to prevent sale and development in orchard land.
