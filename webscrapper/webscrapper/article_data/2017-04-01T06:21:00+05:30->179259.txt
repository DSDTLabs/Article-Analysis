TIRUVANNAMALAI: The   has launched a drive to identify people who joined as teachers in   in   by submitting forged documents. 

 Chief education office of Tiruvannamalai district Jayakumar said the department would scrutinise the appointment of teachers since 2012 as several people had joined as teachers at government schools after producing forged documents and appointment orders.
 
 "We will filter the applications based on the date of joining. We will conduct a thorough check of the documents, appointment orders, transfer orders and other documents of the candidates who joined duty since 2012. If we find someone joined for duty by producing fake documents, we will file a case against the individual and also take departmental action against him or her. We will also take necessary steps to recover the salary he or she had been receiving," said the CEO.
 
 The education department has taken the measure after identifying three people who joined as teachers in government schools three years ago by producing fake appointment orders. 
 
 A few of the teachers in government school were involved in the scam, said education department officials.
 
 In the last two days, the department suspended two teachers, including a head master (in-charge), of the government schools under the provisions of the   (Discipline and Appeal) Rules for indulging in malpractices and creating fake documents like appointment and transfer orders.
 
 The CEO issued the suspension order to Sakthivel, head master (in-charge) of the Government High School in Avaniyapuram, and A Sakkarai, a Tamil teacher of GHS in Mathalampadi, on Thursday and Friday respectively.
