CHANDIGARH: An aspiring athlete, who won the   medals in 100 and 400 meter races in Haryana Open School Games, was stabbed to death in Madhuban on Saturday.

 Victim  , who was returning home after practice, was found injured with stab wound in his stomach and taken to trauma centre in Karnal by his friends. However,   succumbed to injuries during treatment.
 
 SP   said they have formed three teams to solve the case. “We are working on different theories as the victim’s parents as well as the complainant, Sandeep’s uncle, have denied any personal enmity towards anyone. The body has been handed over to the family after the autopsy,’’   said.
 
 As the circumstances leading to the murder remain a mystery, complainant Shiv Kumar said his nephew had left home for practice in Golf Grounds in Madhuban around 9am. He said his nephew called him on the phone later in the day, asking him to come as he had got into an altercation with someone. He said he got another call later, from Sandeep’s friends, saying they were taking him to hospital as he had suffered a stab injury.
 
 Madhuban SHO   who is investigating the case, said the victim did not identify the people who had attacked him. “He died during the treatment. His friends had also recovered a bottle of poison from him. Now, we have asked for the viscera samples for chemical examination to ascertain the exact cause of death,’’ he said.
