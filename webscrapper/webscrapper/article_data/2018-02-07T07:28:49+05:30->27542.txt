JALANDHAR: A joint action committee (JAC) of   has alleged that the “transport mafia was still operating like earlier times” and illegal operations of buses were continuing. 

 Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, leaders of the JAC, which is a representative body of different employees unions of Punjab Roadways, said they thought that the Congress government would set things right as Punjab chief minster Amarinder Singh had stated before the assembly elections in 2017. They said after observing little change in the past 11 months, they decided to come out against the “continuation of the policy to protect transport mafia” at the cost of public sector undertakings.
 
 “Just after the poll results, things suddenly improved as private operators, who were plying their buses illegally, took their buses off the roads and there was jump of Rs 40 lakh in the daily earnings of Punjab Roadways. However, things were back to square one and illegally operated buses started thriving at the cost of those being run in public sector,” said JAC convener   in the presence of other leaders of the committee.
 
 “The only difference is that earlier SAD leaders dominated the illegal operations but now Congress leaders had a major share in the operations. Interests of leaders of both parties are bring protected,” JAC members alleged, adding that “even no action has been taken against a particular official who was instrumental in tweaking the transport policy and harming government interests in the 10 years of the SAD-BJP regime.”
 
 Roadways employees’ leaders also pointed out that the transport policy was yet to be finalized and the draft made public made it clear that the government was keen to protect private bus operators, most of whom were senior politicians. “Even as the Punjab and Haryana high court over a year back ordered cancellation of over 12,000 permits, the state government was yet to implement it and all those buses were still plying,” said  , a JAC leader.
