Canberra: A four-year search of the depths of the   has failed to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. But the unprecedented sonar hunt for the missing airliner might be close to solving 19th century mysteries — the locations of two sailing ships that vanished with cargos of coal.

 
 Maritime historians on Thursday published a short list of the possible identities of two shipwrecks found during the initial 710,000-square km three-year search for the Boeing 777 that was lost in 2014 with 238 people aboard.
 
 The wrecks, found in 2015, are 36km apart and 2,300km southwest of   in debris fields scattered with coal more than 3.7km below the ocean’s surface. The searchers had a closer look with underwater drones that took photographs of both sites.
 
 Western Australian Museum’s examination of the images of the scattered remnants of a wooden ship discovered on May 19, 2015, found it was possibly the brig W   or the barque Magdala. W Gordon was on a voyage from Scotland to Australia when it disappeared in 1877 with 10 crew aboard. Magdala was lost in 1882 while sailing from Wales to Indonesia.
 
 An iron wreck found on December 19, 2015, was most likely the barque West Ridge, which vanished while sailing from England to India with 28 sailors in 1883. But Anderson doubted that the identities of the two deepest wrecks would ever be confirmed without a wealthy private benefactor because of their depth and remoteness. “We’d be looking for any artifacts or anything that could confirm providence.”
