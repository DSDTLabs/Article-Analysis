The world is fighting   and it is the theme for this year’s   as well. Closer home, after   implemented the plastic ban in March this year, the usage of plastics has reportedly gone down. People across the state have switched to cloth or paper bags for carrying groceries, restaurants have ditched   for paper variants and shopkeepers have refused to give plastic carry bags to customers.
 So, as #BeatPlasticPollution trends throughout the day today, Puneites too are doing their bit to ensure that the attention doesn't fade and the fight is won!
