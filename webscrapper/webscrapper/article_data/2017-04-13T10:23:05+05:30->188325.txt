Panditji takes out an auspicious date for Adi and Aaliya's wedding. With so less time, everyone gets worried about making arrangements.
 
  Shagun shows the wedding card sample to Ishita. Ishita tells her that both the families will share the expense equally.
  
  Aaliya meets the same man who was following her, outside the house. He holds her hand. Aaliya shouts and he runs away. Raman scolds the watchman and instructs him to be more careful.
  
  
 
  
  Adi meets Gagan and the two share lunch. Ashok sees them sitting together and getting friendly.
  
  Raman reaches office. The same man who was following Aaliya comes to Raman and asks for work in his office. He tells him that his name is Abhay Bhaskar. Raman helps him get work.
  
  Ashok, on the other hand, calls Gagan and asks him to not get over friendly with Adi. Gagan tells him that he has no grudges against him and wants to support and help Adi. Ashok doesn't like this and thinks of troubling Adi through someone else.
