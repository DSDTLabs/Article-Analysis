CHANDIGARH: Even though the Delhi leadership of   (AAP) is embroiled in a major controversy on Sunday with former Delhi minister Kapil Mishra making bribery charges against party supremo Arvind Kejriwal,   MLAs of the party are hopeful that the rejig of the state unit would go on as planned. Kejriwal had convened a meeting of the Punjab leaders on Monday in Delhi where he was to first meet the legislators in small groups and then hold a collective meeting to discuss how to restructure the state unit. The state leaders are looking at a change in the hierarchy of the party and also the possibility of a new state convener being named. Till Sunday evening, the meeting was still on the cards.

 “We hope that the Delhi controversy will not come in the way of the restructuring of the Punjab unit. It is already long overdue,“ said an   leader.
 
 The 20 Punjab MLAs of the party had earlier held a meeting on April 29, to introspect on the party's performance in the last assembly elections and there was a general consensus that there should also be a change of guard in the state.
 
 The Delhi-centric hierarchy of the party could also be changed and a new nomenclature like the other traditional parties was likely to be finalized. At present, the zonal in charges and Delhi-appointed observers control the party's organizational structure in the state. The party leaders have already tagged it as one of the factors for the party's poor performance in the assembly elections.
 
 “It is learnt that appointment of a new state convener president can take place in the meeting and MLAs would be asked to endorse the new choice,“ said a party leader.
