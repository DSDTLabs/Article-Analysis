GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister   has dropped his earlier plan to conduct   at 41 places across the state on May 31 to propitiate the rain gods. 

 After the rethink, the CM directed the district authorities and municipal corporations to hold 'Narmada Jal Pujan' instead.
 
 The Parjanya yagnas were planned to mark the culmination of   government's month-long 'Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyaan'.
 
 A senior officer privy to the development told TOI, "All collectors and municipal commissioners have been given fresh instructions regarding the Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyaan. There are major changes, including dropping of the yagna and replacing it with Narmada Jal Pujan. Considering high temperatures,   will be done before noon."
 
 A monthlong drive was undertaken to de-silt and deepen rivers, lakes, pond, canals and other water bodies to harvest more rainwater during the forthcoming monsoon season.
 
 Gujarat is battling an acute water crisis this summer. At the peak of summer, the 204 dams in the state have only 29% water against its storage capacity of 25,227 million cubic meter (MCM). 
 
 Last year around this time, there was 40% water in the dams.
