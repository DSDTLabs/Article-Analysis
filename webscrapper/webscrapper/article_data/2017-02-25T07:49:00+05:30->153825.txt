GURUGRAM: The   (MCG) on Friday sealed 13 commercial properties in zone 4, including a car showroom, after their owners failed to deposit   despite being served repeated reminders. 

 Zone 4 has the maximum number of commercial units in the city and the civic agency has prepared a list of 604 defaulters. 
 
 While some of these defaulters have already paid the tax after being issued notices, others have not and face the threat of their premises being sealed.
 
 “We had sent notices to 604 defaulters and had asked them to deposit their property tax by February 23. While some of them have deposited, other have not and we have started sealing their units. On Friday, out of the 13 premises that we sealed, seven of them are located in Raheja Mall on Sohna and five of them are in Cyber Park, while one is sector 34,” said Rohit Yadav, MCG joint commissioner, zone 4.
 
 Collectively these 604 defaulters owe MCG around Rs 250 crore as some of them have never ever paid property tax. “This time around we are very keen to recover the dues and apart from sealing these units, we will also plan to attach these properties and auction them,” Yadav told TOI.
 
 The MCG authorities insist that owners should avail the rebate scheme announced by the Haryana government, in which property owners are being offered a 25 percent rebate and one time interest waiver on their tax dues, arrears till 2016-17.
