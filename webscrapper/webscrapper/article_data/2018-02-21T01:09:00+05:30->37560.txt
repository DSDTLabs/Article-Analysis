NEW DELHI:  , an institute for   education at  , will be displaying “parallel research” on modern science fields like aeronautics, metallurgy and others during a youth fest to “break   about the ancient language.”

 The first-of-its-kind event will take place on February 22 where students of seven universities, including   and  , will take part in it. Students will also get the opportunity to earn prizes in several competitions, such as Sanskrit plays, painting, song, creative writing, translation and Shloka writing.
 
 “Many think that the language is dead and only a few from a particular section of society know it. That is false. Over a thousand people will prove Sanskrit’s rising popularity at the event,” said Sushil Kumar, coordinator of Delhi State Samskrit Bharati.
 
 An exhibition on technology in Sanskrit and Sanskrit Vigyan Pradarshini will showcase the presence of technological advancements in ancient manuscripts. “This will show advancements made in India in the fields of science and technology, including mathematics, geometry, aeronautics, computers and astronomy,” said Kumar.
 
 A student of JNU’s Sanskrit Study Centre, Radhakrishna Yadav, said, “There may be opposition at the event as many don’t follow our ideals. This is evident from the long delay for the centre to be turned into a school.”
 
 According to Samskrit Bharati’s book “Science in Sanskrit”, modern-day ideas about science, such as planetary motion, cause of eclipse, concepts of gravity, speed of light, and air transport are already mentioned in ancient manuscripts. Aryabhatta never got credit for his discoveries even though most of his works form the basis of modern scientific thought.
