Nagpur: Two persons have been booked for fraud and cheating for duping State Bank of India, Kingsway branch, to the tune of Rs26.12 lakh on the pretext of procuring a home loan.

 Atul Patel (47) and Devesh Kawle (37) allegedly furnished forged sale deeds of a property already sold to another person to get a loan of Rs34.58 lakh in April 2015. Patel colluded with Kawle to defraud the bank.
 
 Police said Kawle was given a fake registered sale deed of a Ramdaspeth-based property by Patel, and used it to procure the loan. Kawle had repaid the monthly instalments but stopped making payments after paying some Rs8.46 lakh.
 
 The bank initiated a process to verify the documents and conducted a legal search of the property. During the search, it came to fore that Patel had already sold the property to another person and created a fake sale deed in favour of Kawle. The bank authorities approached Sitabuldi police station, where an offence was registered against Patel and Kawle under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code.
