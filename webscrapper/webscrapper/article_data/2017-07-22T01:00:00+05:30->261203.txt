Chandigarh: Plethora of cultural activities added different flavors of life to city beautiful on Friday. A culmination of five forms of art under one roof at Punjab Kala Bhawan in Sector 16 was certainly a treat for art lovers.

 Organized by Aariz Theatre Group's ‘Cultural Festival 2017’ in association with Punjab Arts Council and Punjab Sahitya Akademi, the event witnessed performances by several vocalists, dancers, actors, poets and artists of Tricity.
 
 An art exhibition, in collaboration with Musawar, a city-based student run art community, opened at the venue at 11am and saw enthusiasts pour in all day. The stage went live at 4pm and opened with an acoustic music set, followed by an Indian classical dance performance soon after which, the first play of the evening ‘Raahat’ was staged.
 
 Keeping up with the compelling aura of the evening, was Mukhtalif's line up of ten poets, each of whom delivered fiery verses one after the other.
 
 Two music sets, one in its Blues and Indie Rock element and the other Punjabi folk, further upped the ante and readied the stage for the second and final play, ‘Laare’.
 
 “Both the plays, penned by the late Gursharan Singh, are political satires and are in tandem with the country's current political scenario,” said the director.
 
 The performances, which concluded all too soon, managed to be as enthralling as they were owing to the relentless grit and effort put into them.
