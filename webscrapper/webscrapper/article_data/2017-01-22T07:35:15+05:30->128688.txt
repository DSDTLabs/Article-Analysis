LUCKNOW: The BJP dropped some prominent leaders from the list of 40 star campaigners announced for the assembly elections on Saturday. Among those sidelined are veterans   and   Joshi, Sultanpur MP Varun Gandhi and former MP Vinay Katiyar.

 Though none of former UP BJP chiefs figure in the list, the present chief Keshav Prasad Maurya has been included.
 
 Since Advani and Joshi are now in party’s ‘margdarshak mandal’ their omission was expected, a BJP leader said, adding that exclusion of Varun and Katiyar, though, has surprised many in the party.
 
 The party, however, has included Swami Prasad Maurya, who joined the BJP after turning against BSP chief Mayawati. But other rebels like Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Brijesh Pathak, Jugul Kishore and Lokesh Prajapati, who switched to the BJP recently, have been excluded.
 
 While Yogi Adityanath, who was reportedly unhappy after being excluded from UP election panel, finds a place among 40 star campaigners, Muzaffarnagar riot-accused Suresh Rana and Sangeet Singh Som have been dropped. 
 
 Since Rana and Som are contesting elections they could not have been included as star campaigners, a BJP leader said, adding that Joshi and Pathak’s ommision could mean they may also get party tickets. However, the leader could not reply why Rana and Som’s be roped in for campaigning for the second phase since elections on their seats would be over in the first phase. 
 
 PM   and BJP chief Amit Shah top the list of star campaigners. Among others included are Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Mahesh Sharma, and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Uma Bharti and Kalraj Mishra. Others named are BJP national organisational secretary Ramlal, co-organisational secretary Shivprakash, state organisational secretary Sunil Bansal, and party MP Ramshanker Katheria.
