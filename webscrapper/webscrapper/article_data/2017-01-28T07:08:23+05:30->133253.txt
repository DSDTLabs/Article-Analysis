PUNE: Not a single nomination was filed for the   on Friday, the first day. 

 A delay in forming alliances between parties appears to be the reason for the lack of enthusiasm, while some candidates chose to stay away as they felt the day was “inauspicious”.
 
 Election officials have set up a decentralised system for filing of nomination forms and returning officers have been deputed in 14 ward offices.
 
 “No nomination form was received by any returning officer on Friday,” election officer for PMC Satish Kulkarni said.
 
 Several party hopefuls said they were unsure about their candidature. “We have to decide if we want to fight on the party ticket or as independents. A decision will be made once the official list is announced,” a ticket hopeful, requesting anonymity, said.
 
 Ajay Shinde,   (MNS) city unit chief, said various factors including “beliefs” of people were responsible for the lack of action. “Candidates are touchy about things such as muhurat. The first day for filing was amavasya, a new moon day, which is not considered auspicious,” he said.
 
 According to leaders of different parties, issues such as a delay in getting the affidavits and   too have played a role.
 
 As many as 10 municipal corporations, including Pune, will go the polls on February 21 and the results will be announced on February 23. The nomination forms are to be filled online. But the final printout will have to be submitted as copy.
 
 Forms on Sunday too
 
 The election commission has declared that forms will be accepted on Sundays too. The deadline to submit the nomination forms for the civic election is February 3, and forms can be submitted on January 29, a Sunday.
