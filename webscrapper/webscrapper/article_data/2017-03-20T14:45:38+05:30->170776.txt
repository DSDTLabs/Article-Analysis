 PATNA: Bihar BJP chief and Ujiarpur MP   on Sunday said the formation of BJP government in neighbouring   with Yogi Adiyanath as its CM would help strengthen the party in the state.
 
 “BJP’s emphatic victory in UP will work as a big booster for the party in Bihar. Henceforth, the party workers in the state would be active and their every moment would be dedicated to winning the 2019 parliamentary and 2020 assembly elections here,” Rai said.
 
 Rai said the party’s central leadership extended invitations to former deputy CM  , former state chiefs   and   as well as state general secretary (organisation) Nagendra Ji to participate in the function organised for Adiyanath’s swearing in ceremony. “They did not go on their own. It was on the invitation from the party,” Rai added. 
 
 However, Rai and leader of opposition in state assembly Prem Kumar did not go to Lucknow, as the meeting of the party’s state office bearers and district presidents was scheduled for Sunday at the party’s state headquarters to chalk out programmes to activate the rank and file for the all 43 district-level executive committee meets to be held simultaneously on March 22. Besides, similar block level meetings are due on March 26.
 
 Asked if the Bihar BJP would also play Hindutva card, Rai said, “We did not lose the 2015 assembly election in Bihar due to our wrong strategy. That strategy was also in Bihar, but we lost due to rumours spread by the rivals about us.”
 
 Poonam Sharma, sister of UP deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, who runs a high school in Kidwaipuri locality here, offered ‘ladoos’ to Rai and others present at the state BJP headquarters on Sunday.
