SHILLONG/GUWAHATI: After three days of unrest,   had a few peaceful hours on Sunday - only to be disturbed by violence that erupted again in defiance of the curfew in the evening. Security forces had to resort to firing teargas shells in violence-hit areas. 

 
 The curfew, which had been imposed in several areas of the city since Friday morning, was lifted for seven hours on Sunday. "The curfew was relaxed from 8am to 3pm and people went to the church. The Army has been kept on standby,"   deputy commissioner PS Dkhar told TOI. 
 
 Hours after the curfew was imposed again, miscreants attacked police and Army at different locations around Punjabi Lane, epicentre of the four-day-long spell of violence. According to reports, a cameraperson of a national TV channel was injured after he was hit by a stone pellet. "
 
 However, there was no immediate report of any casualty from any part of the city, even as the situation remained tense. Violence had erupted in the city last Friday after an altercation between some people and bus drivers and conductors at the Punjabi Lane area, adjacent to Iewduh (Barabazar).
 
 Sangma said money and alcohol were used to "lure youths" to carry out disruptive activities in parts of the capital city.
