MOHALI:  roads are the most dangerous in the Tricity. On an average, 24 persons were killed every month on Mohali roads in the past 15 months, making the district most accident-prone as compared to Chandigarh and Panchkula.

 As per official records, 364 persons lost lives in the district in the past 15 months — 310 in 2017 and 54 in the past three months till March this year. The figure is more than twice of that reported in Chandigarh and Panchkula, which witnessed 107 and 101 deaths in road accidents in 2017, respectively.
 
 The police have identified 25 black spots in the district and claimed to have taken steps to reduce the   rate, but results are not visible. As per data, maximum accidents occurred on Computer Chowk in Phase VII, PCL Chowk in Sector 71, Phase 3B2-VII light point, Ambwala Chowk, phases III and V light point, Balongi Barrier and main bus stand of Kharar.
 
 The reasons are numerous: under-construction roads, improper lighting, lack of road signs, speeding, drunken driving, bad condition of roads and high density of vehicles.
 
 Navdeep Asija, traffic adviser, Punjab, said, “While traveling on Mohali roads, risk of death is double as compared to other districts of Punjab. Lack of law enforcement, speeding and drunken driving are the main reasons, besides dug-up patches. Moreover, the district has maximum highways. The authorities need to work on enforcing traffic rules and check speeding and drunken driving. Road infrastructure should also be improved.”
 
 Tarun Rattan, SP (traffic), said, “Mohali has heaviest traffic as compared to Chandigarh, Panchkula and other districts of Punjab. Traffic congestion is the main reason behind accidents. We regularly issue challans to violators and try to control haphazard traffic. We are strict with speedsters and drunk drivers. We have also started special drives.”
