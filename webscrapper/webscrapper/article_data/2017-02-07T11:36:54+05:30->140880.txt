VADODARA: Railways unions including the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR), the   (WRMS) and other zonal railway unions affiliated with the NFIR staged demonstrations in all the 16 zonal railways of the Indian Railways on Monday to protest alleging that the central government was trying to finish the trade union movement. 

 While WRMS office-bearers took out a rally and raised slogans at the divisional railway manager (DRM) office at Pratapnagar, NFIR’s vice president and WRMS general secretary   addressed a rally of railway employees at Mumbai. 
 
 The railway unions are perturbed by the recent announcement by the centre that railway supervisors working as junior engineers and senior engineers in grade pay Rs 4,200 and Rs 4,600 cannot remain office bearers of trade union after March 31, 2017 to improve safety. “This is an example of high handedness of the government to finish the trade union movement of Indian Railways which has played a constructive role since last over 60 years. This is not permitted by the Trade Union Act 1926,” said Mahurkar. 
 
 “There are only 1.5 % supervisors who are office bearers of recognised federation – NFIR. The government in its budget has totally neglected other areas where inputs are required but funds are not available to improve safety of railways,” said Mahurkar. The unions have also criticized the move of the 7th Pay Commission to stop special allowance for railway employees without citing any reasons. NFIR has requested the release of allowances that are pending with the committee of finance department.
