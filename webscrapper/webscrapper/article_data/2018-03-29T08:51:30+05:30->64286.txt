CHANDIGARH: AAP MLA and leader of opposition   on Wednesday claimed that chief minister   was going soft on   because of an upcoming matrimonial alliance between the families of CM Capt   and his predecessor at the top post, Parkash Singh Badal.

 Khaira said it was a personal matter, “but I have information that families of Amarinder and Badal will soon forge a matrimonial alliance and that is why they are hand in glove”. When asked to elaborate, he said, “That I will tell you a little later.” 
 
 The AAP leader also claimed that   MLAs did not have the support of their CM on most of the issues they were raising.
 
 Khaira said the government was being “penny wise” by bringing a resolution on the income tax of cabinet ministers and yet having an army of advisers and OSDs.
 
 On his verbal spat with Congress MLA Rana Gurjit Singh, Khaira said it was the former who started it and made objectionable remarks. “Other than him, it has never happened with anyone else,” he said.
 
 Khaira also termed the breach of privilege motion against him “political vendetta” and said AAP members present in the House had walked out on the issue. Khaira clarified that he kept sitting while other AAP members walked out because a resolution on salary of the leader of opposition was to come up and the treasury benches would have otherwise made an issue out of it.
