THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   (MVD) has once again extended the implementation of modified driving test till next week. The modified driving test of   was earlier planned to be implemented from Monday. 

 MVD had postponed the introduction of modified driving test twice since it was first introduced in February. Following request from driving schools owners to provide training to the applicants, the system was postponed to April.
 
 Again, when MVD planned to reinstate the system in April, driving schools sought stay order from high court till May 15. However, MVD has now decided to continue the old system till next week.
 
 Gradient parking and angular reverse parking are some of the additional features included in the driving test by MVD to ensure road safety and reduce the number of accidents. But it was opposed by driving school owners and instructors stating that it would affect their revenue.
 
 Presently, only four centres of MVD in the state-Muttathara, Parassala, Kannur and Kozhikode-have the facility to conduct the modified test.
 
 According to an official from MVD, transport minister   is yet to take a decision on the modified driving test due to which the date has been extended to next week. A meeting will be convened by the transport minister with representatives of driving school union on Wednesday, following which MVD will take a decision.
 
 "We are expecting a positive response for the implementation of modified driving test from the minister. We have given enough time for the driving schools to train the applicants," said joint transport commissioner Rajeev Puthalath.
