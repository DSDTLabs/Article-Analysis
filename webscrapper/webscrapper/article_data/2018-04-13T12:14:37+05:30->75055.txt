SURAT: A third-year bachelor’s of technology student of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology ( ) attempted suicide in his hostel room here on April 8. 

 However, he was stopped from hanging himself by his friends. SVNIT authorities have sent him to stay with his relative in Vadodara.
 
 The student had attempted to hang himself at   hostel block in SVNIT. The incident was kept under wraps by the SVNIT authorities since three students had committed suicide in the institute in the past two years. 
 
 The student had attempted suicide to threaten his friends after a tussle with them, sources informed.
 
 “The student did not attempt suicide but was issuing threats and tried something to terrify his friends after a dispute with them. Since other students found it serious, they alerted the faculty members and the institute officials decided to send him to stay with his relatives for a few days,” said a senior faculty member.
