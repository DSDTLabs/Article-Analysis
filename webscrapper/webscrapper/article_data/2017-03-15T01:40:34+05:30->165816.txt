MUMBAI: The state government is committed to building a Dr Rammanohar Tripathi   Bhasha   on the   campus of the University of Mumbai, said the education minister after a special high-level meeting at the Vidhan Bhavan on Tuesday.

 Mumbai University has failed to utilise a Rs 2 crore grant given by the District Planning & Development Committee for the construction. The suburban collector recently issued a notice that the unutilised funds would lapse with the financial year.
