LUCKNOW: A 37-year-old Bangladeshi woman suffering from unexplained chest pain for months finally got relief after a 15-minute procedure at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI).

  resident  , who arrived with an ‘unknown’ disease, was diagnosed with an infrequent version of coronary artery disease (CAD), the commonest heart disease in Asia.
 
 The version affects the mouth of the main artery and is seen in 5% of CAD patients.   said that until now, her condition was dismissed as gastritis even as she felt that she would die of pain.
 
 She was referred by   to SGPGI’s gastroenterology department. However, Prof  , who attended to the patient, referred Bokul to the department of cardiology for an assessment of the heart.
 
 “She was writhing in pain as she walked towards us. Her radiating pain was a clear symptom of angina—chest pain that occurs when heart muscles do not get enough oxygen-rich blood due to a disease. The patient was taken for an angioplasty. The result confirmed CAD,” said Prof PK Goel, head of the cardiology department SGPGI. He handled the case with his team.
 
 On why the disease was not diagnosed in  , Prof Goel said, “Her disease involved the tip of the main artery. It is an infrequent phenomenon seen in about 5% of CAD patients. The diagnosis is a matter of expertise and experience which is surely with us.”
 
 Prof Goel added that they followed an unconventional path to treat the patient. “Instead of referring the patient to cardiac surgeons who have long waiting lists, we undertook angioplasty upon her and brought relief in a 15-minute minimally invasive procedure,” he told reporters.
 
 Bokul, who hails from an economically weak section of society, said that she had accepted her pain as fate.
 
 “I thought I would die because of this pain someday. But these doctors seem to have done some magic. It feels the treatment has added a few years to my life. I shall pray for them with each breath,” said Bokul.
