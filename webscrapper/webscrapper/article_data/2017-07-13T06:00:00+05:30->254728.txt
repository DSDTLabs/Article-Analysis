Visakhapatnam: Members of Vuda Harita Allottees Association has demanded Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) to rectify defects pointed out by their empanelled architects and civil engineers to make the houses suitable for residence.

 Addressing the media on Wednesday, association president Gan Bhukta said that social infrastructure consisting of a community centre, shopping centre and medical centre is yet to be handed over to the association. “The greenbelt area should be according to government norms as the present ornamental garden will vanish soon,” he said.
 
 The members also asked the concerned officials to supply municipal water from GVMC as bore-well water is not sufficient for them.
 
 “The officials should also hand over occupancy fitness certificates to the association. Each flat owner in all HIG, MIG and LIG categories should be provided with car parking facility as promised in the allotment letter and the notified parking lot number has to be mentioned in the sale deed,” Bhukta said.
 
 The members also demanded the Vuda to fulfil necessary requirements for the efficient functioning of the LPG gas pipeline. They also asked the officials to hand over all plans for every structure and building including underground facilities. Construction of the project began in 2009, but it was not completed within the deadline of 2011. Original allotment was at Rs 1,719 per sft and it was later revised to Rs 2,170. The project comprises 100 HIG, 490 MIG and 120 LIG flats. The houses were allocated through a draw in 2015.
