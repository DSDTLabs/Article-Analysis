KOLHAPUR: Political activities in the district have picked up pace over the past two days.

 Every political party is expected to field its own candidate for the post of the Kolhapur zilla parishad president. The results for the ZP polls were a mixed bag for the BJP and Congress, with each winning 14 seats. The NCP has got 11 seats and Shiv Sena managed to win 10 seats.
 
 All the parties are away from the 34 seats needed for a majority in the House and every party is claiming that they can reach the magic figure by forming alliances with other parties.
 
 As per the rules, the period of the existing ZP ends on March 20. The first general body meeting of the newly-elected members of the ZP is supposed to be conducted by March 21 and the president should be elected by then.
 
 State revenue minister   is confident of the BJP coming to power with the help of alliance partners such as  , Swabhimani   and Tararani Aghadi. 
 
 “At present, we have 27 members along with our fellow alliance partners. We are confident of getting support of the Shiv Sena, which has won 10 seats. With these figures, we can come to power in Kolhapur Zilla Parishad. We are now waiting and keeping track of the decision regarding alliance between the BJP and the Shiv Sena in Mumbai. Based on this, we can take the decision and get support of Sena for Kolhapur,” said Patil. 
 
 Like BJP, the Congress is also banking on the support of the Shiv Sena to come to power. Congress district president P N Patil said, “We are in touch with all the political leaders from the district. We have won 14 seats. The independent candidates and other groups that had contested election forming their own group have expressed their willingness to support our party and be the part of alliance. With the help of these parties, we can come to power in the ZP. We are working on it and will soon declare the list of our supporters.”
