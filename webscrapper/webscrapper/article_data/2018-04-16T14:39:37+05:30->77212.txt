VADODARA: Citizens living in the high-end residential buildings in   have taken upon themselves to keep thieves and burglars away.

 The residents have themselves started patrolling the area at night after several incidents of vehicle thefts were reported there since the beginning of April.
 
 According to residents living in different residential complexes, 11 bikes have gone missing from the parkings since April 2. Footages of CCTV cameras, which the residents have found, reveal that a same gang was involved in all bike and two-wheeler thefts.
 
 In all the footages it is seen that thieves entered by jumping the wall. The vehicles too were stolen by lifting them and passing it across the walls. “The security guards were sitting in the front while the bikes were stolen from the rear side. In all the incidents, the theft was learnt only in the morning on next day,” said  , a general manager working in a multinational company. 
 
 He added that the residents are taking turns to remain awake at night and also patrol the streets to nab the thieves and prevent more thefts.
 
 Besides the irregular patrolling of police, residents also blame Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) for not providing streetlights in the entire area. “We had to put up our own streetlights and halogens around our buildings so that there is some light around,” said another resident  , who is a lawyer. Interestingly, some of the residents have even started chaining their vehicles to prevent them from getting stolen.
 
 Last week, the residents also met local   alias Sotta and Saurabh Tolumbiya, superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural) to make their representations.
 
 “We have increased our night patrolling in the area and have also placed a night point because of which there have not been theft incidents reported in last seven to eight days. We have got the CCTV footage and are in the process of verifying the accused,” said Tolumbiya.
