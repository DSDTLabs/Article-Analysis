CHENNAI: A 40-year-old software engineer has become the latest victim of 'manja', after the killer thread from a kite slashed his throat while he was riding his bike at Anakaputhur on Tuesday evening. 

 Police said C Sivaprakasam was going on his two-wheeler on Chennai-Maduravoyal Bypass Road with his father Chandrasekaran, 73, when the stray thread got entangled around his neck. 
 
 Siva lost balance and smashed into an iron railing on the side of the road. He was thrown off the vehicle in the impact. The incident occurred around 5.30pm. 
 
 A few passersby rushed the injured to a private hospital where doctors declared Sivaprakasam dead. Chandrasekaran is undergoing treatment at the hospital. 
 
 The Anakaputhur police registered a case and are looking for those who used the thread to fly kites.
 
 Police said Sivaprakasam and his father, residents of Kolathur, were returning home after seeing a piece of land at Agaram Then village near Selaiyur that they were planning to buy. Sivaprakasam, a software engineer in Thiruvanmiyur, is survived by his wife and two daughters, police added.
 
 The city police first imposed a partial ban on the sale and use of manja in 2007, after the death of a two-year-old boy, before completely banning it in 2011, with Section 1 of the City Police Act proscribing flying of kites with 'manja' thread.
 
 In September 2012, the Chennai Katradi Urpathiyalargal Virpanayalargal Sangam, an association of kite manufacturers, moved the Madras high court seekin a direction to restrain the city police from interfering with the manufacture and sale of kites and manja in Chennai. The court refused to lift the ban.
