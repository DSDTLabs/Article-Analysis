NEW DELHI: Sacked   minister   today told party leader 
  he wouldn't eat a thing until he gets an answer from him on where party leaders got the money from to fund their various foreign trips.

 In his second letter in two days, which he posted on Twitter, Mishra said that Kejriwal has always asserted that AAP doesn't have the money to even fight elections.
 
 "...so then where did the money come from for these foreign trips?" asked Mishra, referring to trips abroad over the last two years by Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khetan, Satyendar Jain, Raghav Chadha and Durgesh Pathak.
 
 Mishra was suspended from AAP after his startling allegation that he witnessed Delhi chief minister and AAP leader Kejriwal accepting   in a dodgy transaction. Today, he further said that details of the foreign trips by AAP leaders will reveal a lot about their alleged corruption.
 
  
  
 
 "Someone told me if these details are revealed, the public won't let you stay in power for another moment. What is the secret behind these trips?" Mishra asked.
 
 At the same time, Mishra told Kejriwal to not accuse him of being "a BJP agent" and not question why his revelations are coming at this stage.
 
 "My demand is a small one, a teeny one. If there's nothing to hide, it will take five minutes to answer me," Mishra added.
 
 Yesterday, in another letter, Mishra challenged the AAP chief to contest elections against him.
 
 "You are trying to remove me from the assembly, I challenge you to contest the elections against me, from any seat. Let's fight the election from my Karawal Nagar seat or even your New Delhi seat. If you believe that people are with you, then I am ready to resign," Mishra said while reading out a letter addressed to his 'Guru' Kejriwal.
