CENTURION: An angry   marched off right into the match referee  's cabin when umpires stopped play due to bad light. He was clearly unhappy with something that couldn't be immediately ascertained.

 The skipper was seen wringing his hands in frustration before it was learnt he had gone complaining to Broad about the wet outfield. R Ashwin had trouble gripping the ball. He then walked back to the field and had a word with the umpires.
 
 The light had clearly improved but play did not resume. "The outfield was wet,"   said after the end of the second day's play. "The ball was wet and we told the umpires about it. There was no movement". Pandya becomes the day's meme   experienced that moment on a cricket field when one puts in all the hard work and lets one prick burst that balloon. India's most impressive player from an all-round perspective, here in South Africa, one thought he would do little wrong in a team that was being blamed for all wrongs.
 
 However, Pandya chose Monday to be the jester of the day, much to India's irritation. Tapping one to midwicket, he wanted a run but Virat Kohli refused. Having taken off already, Pandya strolled back taking his own time, bat in hand, leg in the air.
 
 A direct hit from   resulted in what should probably rank as the worst runout this series has seen so far. Not surprisingly, Twitter and social media went completely berserk.
