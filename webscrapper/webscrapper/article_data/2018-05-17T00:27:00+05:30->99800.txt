NEW DELHI: A poster with ‘Maharana Pratap Marg’ written on it was on Wednesday found pasted on an   signboard in Lutyens’ Delhi. The vandalism was later removed by the police.

 Cops are probing the Twitter trail, which had announced that the road had been renamed. A case of Defacement Act has also been registered.
 
 Investigations later revealed that a group of men, claiming to be workers of Bajrang Dal, had first announced the plan to rename the road on social media and then pasted the poster on the signage a few hours later. They also informed a few media channels about the programme, a video of which was later uploaded on Twitter.
 
 “We received a complaint from the   and have registered a case under Delhi Defacement Act at Tilak Marg police station. Enquiries are being made to identify the culprits,” said DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma.
 
 Cops also found a number of Twitter posts supporting the move, with people praising the miscreants. The IP address from which the post had originated is being tracked to identity the accused. In the video, the group of men is seen posing with the poster and celebrating the Rajput warrior’s birthday. Police said that they would go through the videos on the social media to identify the accused.
 
 “There is no proposal to change the name of Akbar Road as of now. The name was changed by a few miscreants and it is the duty of the local police to look into the issue,” said an NDMC spokesperson.
 
 However, this is not the first time Akbar Road signboard has been defaced. In 2016, Akbar Road sign-boards were defaced and posters of ‘Maharna Pratap Marg’ were put up.
