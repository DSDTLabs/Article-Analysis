NOIDA: Two years after the twin authorities in Noida and Greater Noida demoted 88 officials in August 2015, the UP government has revoked the demotion of a project engineer (PE) of the  . The demotion order had followed the   verdict of April 2012, which had upheld Allahabad high court’s decision to scrap reservations in promotions, earlier introduced by the Mayawati government.

 In August 2015, the UP government approved a proposal to withdraw promotions of all government employees who had been elevated under the controversial reservation promotion policy, in cognizance of directions of the SC. Thereafter, the SP dispensation had issued a government order (GO) to draw up a list of gazetted officers, as well as Class B and C employees, who were promoted under the policy between November 15, 1997 and April 28, 2012.
 
 A committee in Noida and Greater Noida scrutinised the files of all SC/ST employees who had been promoted during the 18-year period, and the notches they were to be brought down from their current posts. Then Noida Authority senior project engineer (SPE)   was re-designated as PE. After the demotion order of September 6, 2017 is revoked, Chandra will be restored as SPE, and will also be in the reckoning for the posts of chief maintenance engineer or chief project engineer, Noida.
 
 As per Chandra, the order, which arrived from UP principal secretary (industries) Alok Sinha, states he was wrongly demoted and should be reinstated as per norms and regulations. Chandra had made a representation against his demotion in August 2015 to senior Authority officials, but his petition was dismissed in July 2016. He then represented his case to the state government, saying he was not promoted due to reservation but due to seniority. “I’m happy with the decision. My stand has been vindicated,” Chandra told TOI.
