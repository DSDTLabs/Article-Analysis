KOLKATA: If  's story has sent shockwaves down the spine of the city, mind doctors here say they are not surprised. They say there are hundreds in the city like Udayan, who are leading double lives in the virtual space for  , most of which lead to murky realities. They vouch that the margin between hardcore criminals and the upper class gentry is gradually dissolving thanks to the all-pervasive phenomenon called social media.   - is the term they use for such patients. 

 Udayan is an extreme case of a sociopath who has gone from one success to another by fluke, successes that have triggered the deep-seated criminal in him. Such incidents are eye openers to a deepening crisis all around us.
 
 "Misplaced aspirations lie at the root of these problems. The virtual world gives temporary relief - like some kind of a magic potion. And therein lies its lure. The social media doesn't leave you in a mess like drinks and drugs. Today the social networking circuit is routine like studies or jobs," says counsellor Salony Priya.
 
 "Meeting virtually, falling in love, entering into live-in relationships, falling apart and ending up in violence has become routine. The social media is helping to make and break relationships at break-neck speed, leaving behind a trail of problems. The past is suppressed by starting a fresh account. Simple," says psychiatrist  , who insists Udayan is a sociopath and should not be given the tag of a mentally deranged. 
 
 Take the case of this software engineer who poses as a project leader in Europe. "He is an object of awe, his posts are 'liked', heavily 'commented' upon and 'shared'. There is instant gratification and he translates these as his acquisitions," says psychiatrist Shiladitya Roy.
