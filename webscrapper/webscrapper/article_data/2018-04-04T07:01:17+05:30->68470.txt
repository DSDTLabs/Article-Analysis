AHMEDABAD: The  , where a police inspector is also accused, now hinges on forensic evidence from three mobile phones belonging to Shailesh Bhatt and Kirit  . CID (crime), which is investigating the case, said these phones have digital wallets of various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, from where the said transaction had taken place.

 Bhatt, a real estate developer from Surat, made an application of complaint to CID (crime), alleging that inspector Anant Patel of   district’s local crime branch and a   official extorted 200 bitcoins — valued at Rs 20 crore — from him.
  
  
 Ashish Bhatia, DGP, CID (crime), said they have recorded the statements of Bhatt, his friend and business partner Paladiya and Patel, among others. “We are now verifying the details of what Bhatt has said and what has emerged in the investigation so far. We are also waiting for the   report about the digital wallets on the three mobile phones used by Bhatt and Paladiya,” he said.
 
 CID sources said Bhatt has history of involvement in criminal offences. Among his business interests is a cryptocurrency exchange. “From the investigation so far, it has emerged that a large part of the cryptocurrency involved may belong to other investors. The amount involved could run into crores. It can only be confirmed once the forensic report on the wallets arrives,” said a CID official.
 
 Sources added that one of the phones to scrutinized is locked. The source added that Anant Patel used a digital wallet belonging to a friend of his, to receive the bitcoins from the complainants. 
 
 Officials are still hopeful of extracting information relating to the case. “Cryptocurrencies work based on an ‘address’, an alphanumeric code between 26 and 32 characters long. Whoever knows the address can access the account. Thus, it is difficult to ascertain who owned the currency and who it was it transferred to,” said the official.
