Samuthirakani’s Malayalam debut directorial,   recently made headlines, after actress Varalaxmi walked out of the project, following a tiff with the producer. 

 Taking the reins of the female lead now will be actress  , who is currently shooting for her portions in Kochi. She says, “I am not aware of what prompted Varalaxmi to call it quits. That said, I am quite comfortable with the team here, and the conviction that I could convincingly carry off the role of a mature mother, made them zero in on me.”
 
 Ineya is also part of director Ranjith’s Puthan Panam and she says that’s what prompted the filmmaker to refer her for Samuthirakani’s Aakasha Mittayee.
  On her role, Ineya says, “I play Radhika, Jayaram ettan’s wife in the film. Though she is a very homely woman, she is hell bent on doing things the way she wants.”
 
 A source close to the production unit of the film tells us that the film is not an exact remake of the Tamil film Appa. “Though it will be a family-oriented movie, and will focus on values and relationships,   has tweaked the characters and the plot,” says the source.
 
 When compared to the original, Radhika’s role has a lot more significance in the remake, according to Ineya. She says, “There is a lot of scope for performance. There are sequences, where Radhika realises that her presumptions or actions have been totally wrong, after certain things go haywire.” 
 The actress is awaiting the release of Ranjith directorial and has Pottu in Tamil. 
 
 She signs off, saying, “I am in a state of bliss right now, as this year has brought me a bunch of good films, both in Malayalam and Tamil.”
