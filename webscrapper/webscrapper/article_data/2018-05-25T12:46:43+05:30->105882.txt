LUDHIANA: A Rahon resident, who was arrested in February for posing as an IPS officer, has now been booked for duping a man belonging to Barewal Awana of Rs 4 lakh on the pretext of sending him abroad “using his influence and contacts with the higher authorities.”

 Division number 5 police registered a fresh case against Rupinder after receiving a complaint from Harvinder Kaur. She alleged that Rupinder, known to her through a common friend, had introduced himself as a trainee IPS officer and claimed to have links with senior politicians and police officers.
 
 Complainant’s brother-in-law Sukhjinder Singh, a mechanical engineer who wanted to go Canada, had approached him. While promising to send him abroad,   took Rs 4 lakh from him. But he did not fulfill the promise and instead started threatening Sukhjinder.
 
 On January 12, 2018, the family lodged a complaint with the police. Following an inquiry, cops lodged a fresh FIR against Rupinder under Section 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of the IPC. Investigating officer  , in-charge Kochar Market, said the police registered a case following a probe by senior officer.
 
 Salem Tabri police had earlier arrested Rupinder Singh in February with a licensed weapon, cartridges, nameplate, uniform with stars and blue beacon from him. The accused used to go to places claiming to be an IPS officer and used to influence locals as well as some officials.
 
 He had also managed to get two security guards from a police station. Officials had got suspicious during his visit to the police commissionarate and had later found out that he was impersonating as a cop. He was earlier booked under Section 170 (personating a public servant), 171 (wearing grab or carrying token used by public servant with fraudulent intent), 420 (cheating) of the IPC.
