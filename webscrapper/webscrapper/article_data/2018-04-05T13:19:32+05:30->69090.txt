QUEPEM: The public works department ( ), taking cognisance of a TOI report about the unsafe condition of an approach road to the  , on Monday cordoned the area off with tape on both sides.

 TOI had reported in its edition dated April 2 the dangerous condition of the slopy approach road for motorists and pedestrians alike without a parapet wall.Citizens of Sanguem too had expressed their anger over the PWD’s apathy in not building a wall on this busy traffic link to the town. 
 
 PWD assistant engineer Dayanand   told TOI that this is “just a tape” to create awareness among people to exercise caution.
 
 With a new bridge proposed alongside, he suggested that it would be a dead investment to built a parapet wall. 
 
 “I don’t think the government will sanction money for a parapet as the construction cost will be much higher due to steepness of the slope,” said Nadkarni.
 
 PWD has already acquired land for the parallel bridge, and the forest department has issued its   for the cutting of trees. “The auctioning process will be started for the cutting of trees and the land will be handed over to Goa state infrastructure development corporation,” he said.
