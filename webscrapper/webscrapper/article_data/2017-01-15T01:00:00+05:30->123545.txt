Sonu Sood, who’ll be hosting action superstar   in India next week, is ensuring that everything is in place before his arrival in the city. Before the international star lands in the city, Sonu will fly to Beijing on Tuesday for the promotions of their film, ' '. The   actor is looking forward to experiencing the festivities that begin in China this week on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (January 28). Sonu is excited to carry along a few designer   for Jackie, who, we hear, is a fan of Indian traditional outfits. The martial arts star was fascinated with Jodhpuris after his visit to Rajasthan last year, for a schedule of their upcoming action adventure flick.

 Back then, Sonu presented him a couple of traditional outfits with customised buttons bearing Jackie’s initials. We’re told this time around too, the Jodhpuris will have a personal touch for Chan. Sonu elaborates, “Jackie loved wearing Indian costumes with traditional embroidery work. He feels Jodhpuris with salwars are very comfortable as well.” He adds, “It seems Jackie has ensured Kung Fu Yoga is visible everywhere in China. I’m fascinated by his promotional skills.” 
 
 Post his return, Sonu will personally oversee the prep for Jackie’s Mumbai visit and immerse himself in the promotions of their film that releases on February 3.
