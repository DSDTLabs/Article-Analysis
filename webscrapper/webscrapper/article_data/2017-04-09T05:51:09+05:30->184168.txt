HYDERABAD: Despite tall claims by the   (SPDCL) of providing uninterrupted power during summer, several colonies in   have been witnessing outages and breakdowns.

 As many as 281 breakdowns were reported in the southern discom limits since April 1, of which more than 100 were from the Greater Hyderabad areas such as Kukatpally, Ayyappa Society, Medchal and Champapet. 
 
 “Unscheduled power cuts have become common in Malkajgiri. When we call the officials, they say it is due to some technical issue or maintenance work,” said  , a businessman and resident of Malkajgiri.
 
 Residents allege that the authorities are ensuring there are no power cuts in VIP colonies and surrounding areas while other localities, including  , are badly affected mainly due to lack of proper power infrastructure.
 
 “Power utilities dig roads to lay cable and carry out several other works. They say power failure is due to cable fault. It only indicates inferior quality of their work,” said S Chandrasekhar, convenor of Anti-Corruption Forum.
 
 When there were heavy rains during summer last year, hundreds of colonies in Greater Hyderabad had plunged into darkness, with as many as 130 feeders tripping. The power was restored only after several hours. 
 
 In its Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) reports submitted to the   a couple of months ago, SPDCL admitted that there was a rise in the number of power breakdowns in the past two years. According to the report, there were 7,768 breakdowns in 2015-16, which rose to 6,518 by September 2016. 
 
 Due to the breakdowns, the discom received 10 lakh complaints in two years and nearly 1.5 crore consumers were affected. “Discom officials attend to the complaints immediately after it comes to their notices and 99% of the problems are rectified within five to six hours,” chief general manager of SPDCL said.
