KOLKATA: With the aim of giving students a better ability to crack the national entrance tests, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( ) has introduced a host of changes from the next academic session. The   science and mathematics question papers will now offer fewer choices and necessitate students to have a wider grasp of the subjects. 

 The syllabi of physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology have been revised to meet the needs of prof-essional courses and entrance examinations. 
 
 “The council is aiming for a proper and comprehensive learning from the point of view of the students, which will help them to be better equipped for competitive exams such as IIT JEE and NEET, and also for university-level learning,” said  , the CISCE chief executive and secretary. 
 
 “According to the old pattern of the mathematics question paper, there was a choice between Section B and Section C (Section A is compulsory). The new pattern of the question paper continues to offer the choice between Section B and C, but there will be an internal choice provided. The changes have been brought about keeping in mind the interest of the students,” Arathoon explained.
 
 “We have also restructured the pattern of the English question papers for 2019, making them more contemporary,” he added. “For the ISC English Literature paper, it was found that some students faced difficulty in writing long answers. One long-answer questions per text has now been replaced with a set of short-answer questions, giving the students a better scope for scoring.” 
 
 He also added that letter writing has been replaced with email writing for the ICSE English Language paper and proposal writing has been introduced for the ISC English Language paper.
