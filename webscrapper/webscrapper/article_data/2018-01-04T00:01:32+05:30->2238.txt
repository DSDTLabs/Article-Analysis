Thiruvananthapuram: Though there is huge pressure from the ruling party to unravel the alleged high-level conspiracy involved in the attempt to murder CPM worker L S Saju of Edavacode, the police are yet to find any evidence suggesting that any senior leaders of the   were in the know. 

 All the evidence received so far suggest that it was a crime orchestrated by close friends of slain RSS Basti Karyavahak Rajesh of Edavacode. 
 
 The police had on Monday arrested three RSS workers, Sumesh, Jayashankar and Vignesh, in connection with the attack. Of the three accused, two – Sumesh and Jayashankar - were close friends of Rajesh and used to attend ‘shakha’ sessions with him. They were also close to Rajesh’s family. 
 
 “Sumesh had told us that he used to visit Rajesh’s family regularly after he was murdered and he was deeply affected by the plight of his bereaving wife, who is yet to fully recover from the loss,” said a police officer involved in the probe. The police have also examined the call data records of the phones of the three accused and found out that they were not in contact with any senior leaders or office bearers of their organization. 
 
 “We cannot rule out the possibility of a high-level conspiracy yet as there are still four more persons to be arrested,” the officer said adding that there was also a possibility that those who were in custody could be lying. 
 
 The police have taken one more suspect into custody on Wednesday, but they are yet to record his arrest as they needed to confirm his involvement in the crime. tnn
