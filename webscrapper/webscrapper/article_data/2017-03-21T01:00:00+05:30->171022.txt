PATNA: Country’s top linguists and philosophers have gathered at   (JNU) in New Delhi to deliberate on the works of 7th-century Vedanta scholar Mandan Mishra at a weeklong workshop on ‘Mandan Mishra and his Brahmasiddhi’. 

 Mandan hailed from Mithilanchal in Bihar. The workshop, been organised by the Centre for Indian Languages and sponsored by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research, opened on Sunday and will conclude on March 25, convener Deo Shankar Navin told TOI over phone from Delhi.
 
 Speaking at the workshop, Dhananjay Pandey from BHU, K S Satish and Mahanand Jha from Lal Bahadur Shastri Vidyapeeth and Ram Nath Jha from JNU said ancient texts, like Brahmasiddhi, were relevant today as it was necessary for us to know different traditions of knowledge so that the same could be passed on to the next generation.
 
 “Mandan should be seen as an exponent of many knowledge traditions such as Nyàya, Vedànta, Grammar and Shàkta Principles. Understanding these knowledge traditions is like understanding India,” said Navin.
 
 JNU’s Devendra Choubey welcomed the participants.
