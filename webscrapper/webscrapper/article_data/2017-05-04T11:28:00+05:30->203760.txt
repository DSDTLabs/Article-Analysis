We grew up watching films of different kinds and they all consciously or subconsciously left an impact on our sensibilities. When remaking a film, a filmmaker has to understand that there's no harm in being inspired by the subject or the ethos of the original. But churning out a replica is futile.Honestly, given a choice, I'd love to remake  's   or  's The Untouchables. But it's important that when I remake these, I localise them and make them relatable for my target audience. One cannot just pick a south Indian movie and remake it in Bengali without questioning its relatability in the state. The story needs to be reinterpreted and told differently as opposed to being copied blindly. How a filmmaker copies a subject, a script, camera movements, expressions and the backdrop, thus whipping up a carbon copy of the original, is beyond me. One reason, I feel remakes might not be working in   is because they are emulated shot by shot without being interpreted in a regional (read local) context. For example, south Indian villages are different from the ones in West Bengal, the culture is different, the way south Indian films portray emotions and violence is different. Now, if you blindly copy everything, the result will be disastrous.
I don't understand the insecurity that works behind making an easy remake -one that is stripped off one's creative acumen. Copying a film scene by scene is unpardonable.If you like a subject, think of it in your context, give it a local spin and your own creative touch.
