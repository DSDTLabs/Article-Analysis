 “BJP workers and the police forced people to keep shops and offices open despite our call. They created an atmosphere of fear in Sanand and tried their best to show that people voluntarily kept shops open, which is not true,” Thakor said.
 
 Local police and BJP leaders claimed that the shutdown call had almost no success, as most shops and establishments remained open.
 
 On Tuesday, five cops including Ahmedabad (rural) SP   were injured after farmers and police clashed near  . The rally, which intended to march to Gandhinagar, was organized by farmers of 15 villages in the vicinity of Sanand who are demanding water for irrigation and drinking from either the Fatehwadi canal or the Narmada canal.
 
 A senior leader who is part of the people’s committee said: “We decided to keep the movement totally apolitical, but now with these leaders and even the Congress joining the movement, the agitation which was totally a people’s movement has now got a political colour.
