MUMBAI:The state cabinet on Tuesday announced a hike in subsidy for milk producers. The rate at which milk is purchased from private and cooperative units for manufacture of   has been raised to Rs 3 per litre. 

 Aimed at arresting a slide in price realisation following a global powder glut, the decision is to be implemented in 30 days and will cost the exchequer Rs 32 crore for the financial year. 
 
 
 The subsidy will be extended to manufacturers that agree to generate 20% more milk powder than they produce now. Cooperatives say prices of milk powder have fallen in the national and international market and hit the industry hard. At the end of March, 26,506 tonnes of milk powder was left unsold in the state. 
 
 The state produces 10,000 tonnes of powder per month. As a result, dairy farmers in the state are not finding buyers among manufacturers for all their milk. Cooperatives say they are making losses of Rs 3.24 per litre of milk procured for conversion to powder and are unable to give dairy farmers their desired rate. 
 
 Dairy farmers in some parts of the state have protested against the low rates. There are 21 private and 7 co-operative units in the state that process milk into milk powder, but only 20 of these are in operation. 
 
 From 100 litres of milk, about 8 kg of powder and 4 kg of white butter can be prepared. In 2012-13, the state had provided a subsidy of Rs 2 per litre of milk to industry. “The decision to extend relief is welcome, but it is not enough,” farmer leader   said.
