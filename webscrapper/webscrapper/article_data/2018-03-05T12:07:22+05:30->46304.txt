COIMBATORE: The rural police have started using global positioning system (GPS) receivers to mark the exact spot of road accidents. The collected data is entered in the case diary (CD) file and will also be exported to the   Maps for future reference,  

 “The rural police had received 39 GPS devices. We have handed over a device to each of the 20 alpha teams that attend accident cases in January. They have been using the devices to record the latitude and the longitude of accident spots. We record the details on the CD files to refer to the spots accurately,” superintendent of police   said.
 
 “The remaining 19 devices were handed over to 19 inspectors for the same purpose. The department is also planning to mark the spots on maps so that police officers could easily identify them in future,” he said.
 
 The rural police technical inspector   had given training to 80 alpha team members, 21 inspectors and 46 other police officers.
 
 “A few months ago, we started to use the device in Coimbatore city. Whenever accidents were reported, traffic investigation wing ( ) police used to mention in the FIR that the accident spot was near a bakery or a school. But, this device would give us accurate location. The data would be sent to the state government, which is planning to use the details for a cluster mapping project to identify dangerous spots,” said deputy commissioner of police Sujit Kumar.
