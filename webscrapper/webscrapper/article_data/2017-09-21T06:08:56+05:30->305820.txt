 The suggestion came amid speculations that Dr Pipre is about to join one of the new AIIMS. On August 15, Dr Pipre had suggested to people to name their male newborns as ‘Shivraj’. “There is nothing unethical about suggesting name to parents for new-borns. I would continue the same in the AIIMS, if selected,” said Dr Pipre. He claimed ‘many’ of parents accepted his suggestion and kept name of the new-borns as Narendra. However, he could not provide any proof for the same. In hospital records, a newborn is generally identified by his mother’s name and sex. Delighted over the attention, three days after the event, Dr Pipre indicated that there are 70 deliveries a day in the government maternity hospital. “In my hospital, 60% of the deliveries are males,” said Dr Pipre. Dr Pipre’s suggestion to name the newborns came during ‘Seva Diwas’ programme promoting cleanliness in the hospital. After a woman gave birth in restroom of the hospital recently, there were indications from senior officials of the directorate of medical education and the state minister about replacing the hospital superintendent. 
 
 Under fire for rise in mortality rate and lack of services in the hospital, Dr Pipre said, “The incident has been incorrectly reported. I was there when the woman in question gave birth.” Dr Pipre did not reply to questions over the negligence and stated that the incident that sent “shockwaves in the state over maternity care in the state” never happened.
 
 Senior DME officials preferred not to comment on the issue. “Doctors should have more pressing issues to to attend to,” said an official.
