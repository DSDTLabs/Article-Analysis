AHMEDABAD: A team of   police’s local crime branch (LCB) raided an illegal hookah bar near   on Saturday evening and detained 40-odd persons, mostly youths from Ahmedabad. The panchnama of the scene of the offence continued till late in the night.

 LCB officials said a team led by inspector   got information that a building behind   was used to keep about 30 sheesha (hookahs). There were no signs about the place and only those knowing about it went there. “The hotel has had a licence to operate for the last two years but that was for an eatery. There was no mention of a hookah bar. The site was raided at 4.30pm after a decoy was sent in and confirmed the offence. We are yet to nab the owner and manager of the place,” said an official.
