Hyderabad: As   work continues along Corridors I and III, HMRL authorities say that construction of eight bridges running over railway tracks have become an uphill task for its engineers. The most difficult are the ones at Oliphenta and Alugaddabavi on Nagole-Raidurg stretch.

 The bridges are the only two steel bridges that will have no pillar support for 82 metres and 76 metres respectively. “With railway lines running under the bridges and the areas facing heavy traffic, the usage of heavy machinery is a dangerous proposition. Since only SCR has the expertise to build bridges with a span (suspension without support) of 80 to 120 metres, we are supervising the construction,” said B Ashok, chief engineer (Bridges), South Central Railway.
 
 “To keep the construction time at the site minimal, the bridge weighing about 1,100 tonnes and made of special high grade steel was manufactured and assembled at a factory in Ghaziabad simulating the site conditions at Oliphenta. It was later dismantled and brought here for reassembly. Since this is a double elevation RoB over an existing elevated RoB, it is being built at a height of about 60 feet from road,” said HMRL chief NVS Reddy.
 
 The Metro ROB at Alugaddabavi is another engineering challenge due to the presence of 600 mm diameter water pipeline, 33KV power line, telecom cables and continuous traffic flow, said authorities.
