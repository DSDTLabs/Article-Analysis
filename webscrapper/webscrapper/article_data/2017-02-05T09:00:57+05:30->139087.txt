AHMEDABAD:   was surprised to find a woman settled only for visitation rights, after claiming that her two children were “forcibly taken away” by her ex-husband, their father.

 She had filed a   seeking custody of the children from the “illegal detention” by their father.
 
 The judges were intrigued to find that while the mother was accusing her ex-husband of kidnapping the children, the kids revealed that they had actually ran off to their father’s place from school on December 26 last year.
 
 The HC summoned the woman’s ex-husband along with the children because of the serious allegations, but the children had a different story to tell altogether. After the divorce, the kids were living with their mother, who remarried. The court found the children very bright, mature for their age and confident.
 
 The kids told the court that they were not happy staying with the mother, who had already remarried. They also told the court that their father had not remarried and was living with his parents. Their grandmother mostly looked after the house including their needs.
 
 On the other hand, the father was all too happy to look after his kids. The court noticed, “The father was not satisfied with the children being raised by the mother along with her present husband.” The man told the court he would probably not think about remarrying to look after the children. The court did not want to disturb the children’s stay with their father. But the judges also did not want the mother’s connection to the kids to be completely severed. The court permitted the woman to meet the children once in a week with the observation that: “In the interest of the children, it would be desirable that as far as practicable, they maintain contact with their mother. The love, affection and warmth that a mother can give, particularly to growing children, cannot be substituted by anyone else.”
