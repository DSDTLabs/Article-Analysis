It looks like actor   and team is miffed with a statement made by producer Sashikanth. In the show, the Vikram Vedha producer criticized the gesture of   cars to directors and then publicizing it in the media. Actor Suriya has given cars to his directors like Pandiraj, Hari and  .

 When quizzed about the box office collection report and a film’s success,   said, “Sometimes we get too emotional. When a film is successful, we should quietly celebrate it at home. When we do something together and have struggled to make it happen for two-three years, it has to be celebrated when it’s successful. The fact that it should be publicized is wrong. A lead actor gifted car to his director. How did that become a new item? It has become a habit. I have made 12 films and each film has tasted a different kind of success. There is a lot of pressure in the industry for success.
 
 The comment doesn’t seem to have gone well with Rajsekar Pandian, director & co-producer 2D Entertainment Pvt Ltd (Suriya's production house). “A producer who has failed to pay the salaries in full of the actor and director of his film is talking about gifts!! What an irony!! Hilarious!”
