CHENNAI: "I want to move and mingle with people, but I am Vice-President. We have to respect the protocol," said Venkiah Naidu at a function organised by Gleneagles   to felicitate liver transplant surgeon Dr Mohammed Rela, who has done 1,000 transplants in  .

 Naidu, who frequently visits Chennai for both personal and professional reasons, is in the city and is expected to spend the week in Chennai. "I have six programmes in Chennai in the next couple of days and I will have longer time to spend with my family during this trip. I love meeting people despite my protocol," said Naidu.
 
 His Tuesday schedule began with the felicitation of Dr Rela. He used the opportunity to encourage youngsters to have a healthy lifestyle. "Young people must perform yoga regularly for a healthy life," he said, urging doctors, "who are next only to God", to cut down on antibiotic prescriptions.
 
 He said, "I tell people who wish to go abroad for higher studies to learn, earn and return." He commended Tamil Nadu's achievement in the field of cadaver organ donations and transplants.
 
 Dr Rela said he has performed more than 4,000 liver transplants in India and the UK, where he was employed previously. "I used to think that Global Hospitals chief was dreaming when he invited me to India. Today, we even train doctors in transplant surgery. We also work with the   for their liver transplant surgeries," he said. "Out of all the liver transplants I have performed, the ones in Chennai are close to my heart," he added.
 
 He owed his success to the team of doctors and nurses in the unit.
