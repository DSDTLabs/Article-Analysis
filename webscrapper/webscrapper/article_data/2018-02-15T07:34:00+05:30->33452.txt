AMRITSAR: The   (ASC) has termed the adoption of   for registration of Sikh marriages in Delhi, as farce.

 “The Sikhs as a faith community till today are legally anchored to, according to Article 25 (B) of the Indian constitution, and defined as Hindus,” said a spokesperson of the ASC in an e-mail sent to TOI on Wednesday, adding that unless the basic foundational law in the Indian Constitution was changed and corrected to accurately describe the Sikhs as an ‘independent world religion with their own personal laws,’ all else would remain a farce.
 
 Echoing similar views, Sikh scholar Professor   of  , said, “This is just for the purpose of certification as the basic amendments have not been made to the Constitution.” He said it was more of a political move rather than actually addressing the issue.
 
 Following approval of lieutenant governor of Delhi Anil Baijal, Sikh marriages in Delhi would be registered under Anand Marriage Act instead of the Hindu Marriage Act. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) had taken credit for getting the Sikhs’ wish fulfilled.
 
 The ASC spokesperson said making ad-hoc changes and simply changing and making up a name, such as the Anand Marriage Act, which remains directly under the Article 25 (B), was a mockery of logic. “It is not as simple as it looks, because if a Sikh couple got married under the new Anand Marriage Act, many legal issues will still remain under the Hindu Marriage Act,” he said, adding that new act couldn’t stand by itself unless and until the entire ‘personal law’ for the Sikhs was changed.
 
 He said first condition relating to marriage was being monogamous, age, mental status; second was conjugal rights, separation rights; third was jurisdiction and procedures; and fourth was relating to custody, maintenance and property rights.
 
  suggested that the best way out was to change the name from Hindu Marriage Act to the Indian Marriage Act. “This is the key solution to all the issues,” he said.
