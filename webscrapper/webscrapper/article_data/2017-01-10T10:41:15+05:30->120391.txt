KALYANI/KOLKATA: This year,   in the state will have to choose between writing the   or the   for the   (NDA). 

 The dates for the two popular entrance tests, one conducted by the WBJEE board and the other by the UPSC, are clashing. Both examinations are on April 23. 
 
 The WBJEE authorities, till now, are reluctant to shift the date to the dismay of thousands of students who are preparing for both. 
 
 "We learnt about the NDA examination recently. We were sent a mail by a student who requested us to postpone WBJEE 2017. The mail doesn't even contain any name. But our preparations are on in full swing. We have already received around 8,000 applicants. It is difficult for us to defer the examination. We are still waiting for a confirmation of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) date. If it is held on the same, day then we will be forced to postpone the exam. From next year we will ensure that no such exam dates clash with WBJEE," said a source in the higher education department. Hapless students are now praying that the NEET dates clash with WBJEE.
 
 Subhankar Chakrabarty of Madanpur, Kalyani, is one such student. "I have applied for both the examinations. I come from a poor family. My parents want me to pursue a professional course so that I get a job early," he said.
