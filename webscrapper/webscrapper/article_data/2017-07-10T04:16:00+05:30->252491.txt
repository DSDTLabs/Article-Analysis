Ahmedabad: On Sunday, hundreds of residents from 42 housing societies in   area showed Ahmedabad that trees can be planted with responsibility and earnestness. Close to 1,000 saplings were planted by residents at a recently-developed municipal garden and in each of the participating societies in Motera. 

 Sunday’s   drive had a unique incentive attached to it. Each tree planted by the societies had a plaque next to it. After three years, those who have taken care of trees will win prizes. The same incentive was extended to families living in the 53 societies in Motera which had carried out the tree plantation drive in their own societies.
 
 The event was attended by the mayor and senior officials of the   (AMC). The residents themselves formed an NGO named, ‘Creating Awareness To Change Habits (CATCH)’, and have been practising waste segregation in 53 societies and propagating tree plantation drives. 
 
 Bharat Sisodia, a senior member of the group, says, “The main sponsors of the event are the local provisions store owners who actually depend on business from all residential societies here. The local builders too have contributed to the cause and plan to support the endeavour in future as well.”
 
 Another member,  , a professor at government engineering college, says: “More than the elders, it is the young amongst us who are more enthusiastic in the effort. We will participate in more such drives.”
