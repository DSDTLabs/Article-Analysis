BENGALURU/TUMAKURU: Ahead of the crucial meeting between   state president BS Yeddyurappa and party dissidents on Thursday, supporters of former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa remained firm in their demand seeking a rejig of the office bearers in the organisation. They also reiterated their demand for the BJP to validate the  . 

 At a meeting held at the house of Sogadu Shivanna, a  , the opposition leader in the legislative council Eshwarappa, and MLC M B Bhanuprakash were in attendance. "Until Yeddyurappa mends his ways, we will continue to question and defy him. Come what may, I will attend the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade convention at Kudala Sangama Deva in Bagalkot," Eshwarappa said.
 
 Interacting with the media in Tumakuru, Shivanna played down the significance of the meeting that was held at his house. "There is no difference of opinion in the party, it's a matter of having different opinions," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the Yeddyurappa camp is preparing for a showdown with the dissidents sans Eshwarappa. Sources said that the former CM will be seen at the meeting, which is being held at the party office. 
 
 Yeddyurrappa has reached out only to those leaders who signed the open letter - around eight or nine of them - that questioned his style of functioning. Eshwarappa has not been invited to the meeting, which has been called to iron out differences in the party.
 
 Yeddyurappa is likely to be accompanied by party general secretary Shobha Karandlaje, and the RSS's emissary to the BJP, Arun Kumar at Thursday's meeting. Evading queries on whether or not he would adopt a defiant stance like Eshwarappa, Bhanuprakash said, "The agenda has been fixed by the state party president. We will abide by that. We have been asked by him not to speak about Thursday's meeting."
