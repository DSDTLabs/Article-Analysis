NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University is going to start the admission process for its MPhil and PhD programmes from this week. 

 Though no date has been decided yet, university officials said the process will be rolled out by end of this week and will follow the University Grants Commission’s notification on admissions. The   were delayed as the students first protested over the changes in the admission policies and then approached the Delhi high court.
 
 The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed   students’ plea against the UGC’s notification and said that the commission’s guidelines are “binding” on all universities without any “deviation.”
 
 While Mohit Pandey, president of JNU Students’ Union said that the students are likely to approach a division bench of the court on the matter, JNU administration is preparing for the admissions. The admissions for the research programmes will not have any deprivation points for the aspirants coming from the 105 backward districts. Candidates from these regions used to get up to five deprivation points.
 
 According to university officials there will be less number of admissions this year in the MPhil/ PhD from that of previous years due to the UGC guidelines.
 
 However, the number of seats for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will remain unchanged and deprivation point scheme for admission to these programmes will continue, university officials said.
