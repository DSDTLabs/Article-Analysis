Aamir Khan’s ‘Dangal’, which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar in key roles, has not lost its steam at the box-office. The Nitesh Tiwari-directed film maintained a steady graph at the box-office ever since it hit the screens.
 
  
  
  Continuing with its strong run, ‘Dangal’ collected Rs 3.21 crore on Day 20, taking its total collections to Rs 356.90 crore in India. The wrestling drama became the highest grossing film of Bollywood earlier this week when it surpassed the lifetime collections of Aamir’s 2014 film ‘PK’. ‘Dangal’, which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach   and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers, also became the first Bollywood film to cross the 350-crore mark.
  
  With a few big releases around the corner, will the   starrer film be able to maintain its steady hold? Guess we’ll have to wait to find out.
