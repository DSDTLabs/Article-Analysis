NEW DELHI: The tussle over   shifting one-third domestic flights from Delhi Airport’s terminal to Terminal 2 shows no sign of ending. IndiGo has now moved the   after the   earlier this week dismissed its appeal against   (DIAL)’s decision of shifting some domestic flights of low-cost carriers from T1 to  .

 “Yes, we have filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on matter related to shifting to Terminal 2 (T2) at Delhi Airport,” said an IndiGo spokesman. 
 
 The matter is likely to be heard next week.
 
 DIAL wants to move one-third of flights out of T1 to decongest the terminal and then begin its expansion work. While GoAir (which does not fly international) has already shifted all its domestic flights to T2 at IGI Airport, SpiceJet and IndiGo are yet to move some domestic flights from T1. 
 
 The issue over the shifting of terminals has been hanging fire for over a year now and has delayed the expansion of T1, which is handling much more traffic than its built capacity. SpiceJet has made it clear will shift some flights if IndiGo does the same. 
 
 “IndiGo can’t say that it is either their way, or the runway,” a bench of Delhi HC justices Hima Kohli and Rekha Palli had said earlier this week dismissing IndiGo’s appeal against the partial shifting.
 
 The bench had given a week’s time to the airline to suggest to DIAL, sectors other than Delhi-Mumbai, Bengaluru or Kolkata that it is willing to shift from T1 to T2, as long as they collectively meet the yardstick of one-third passenger traffic volumes of their operations at Terminal 1. 
 
 “In the event such a request is received by the DIAL within the stipulated timeline, the same shall be considered and a decision taken under written intimation to both the airlines within one week from the date of receipt,” HC had said. 
 
 Now with the matter going right up to the apex court, the issue may finally see a closure.
