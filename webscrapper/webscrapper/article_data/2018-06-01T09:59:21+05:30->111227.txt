NOIDA: With speculations rising amongst residents on Noida authority attempting to privatise Noida stadium in sector 21A for revenue generation, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations’ (FONRWA) president   met authority CEO Alok   in   (GNIDA) office on Thursday on the matter and urged Tandon to take residents’ interest into consideration before finalising anything. Earlier too on May 24 (and reported by TOI),   had written to CEO Tandon on the matter with similar concerns.

 In Thursday’s meeting Tandon assured Singh that nothing is finalised on the matter as only views are sought from sports consulting agencies on how to maintain it better with request for proposals (RFP).
 
 “I met CEO   in GNIDA office today (Thursday) as there were many queries from residents over news of authority mulling to privatise Noida stadium. I raised the residents’ concern and urged him to ensure that stadium facilities should not be charged at any extra cost for the residents of the city,” N P Singh, president FONRWA told TOI.
 
 RWA federation had also written to CEO Alok Tandon (as reported earlier on May 24) against any move to privatise Noida stadium by way of hiring a private agency to take over the maintenance of Noida stadium. The RWA body had urged Tandon to prioritise the interests of residents who will have to shell out more in order to use the facilities of the stadium.
 
 While CEO Tandon assured Singh that nothing is finalised yet as authority has only asked views and requests for proposals (RFPs) from sports agencies on how to maintain the stadium better, he stated that “there will be no loss for the common people of Noida as no tax or extra charge will be levied from them,” said Tandon.
 
 Meanwhile ACEO R K Mishra told TOI that even as authority mulls to hire a sports consultant agency, “it will work under the ambit of authority to enable the functioning of Noida stadium and manage various sports activities there.”
