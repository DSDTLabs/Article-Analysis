MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena does not support  's behaviour but party leaders would "raise their hand" wherever needed, its   MP   said.

 He was responding to a question at a press conference about the party's stand on Gaikwad hitting an   employee with a slipper yesterday.
 
 "The Shiv Sena can never support Ravindra Gaikwad's behaviour. But there should be an inquiry to find out why our MP was forced to behave this way,"   said.
 
 "Hitting anybody can never be the culture of the Sena, but we will surely raise our hand wherever required," Raut said.
 
 It is not about a single MP but thousands of passengers who have to face numerous troubles due to Air India's poor service, he said.
 
 "It would have been better had Air India been as quick in improving its service as it was in banning our MP from flying on its aircraft. Passengers are fleeced at airports like Mumbai and Delhi. What happens to their (AI's) quick decision-making then?" he asked.
 
 Before the party take any action against Gaikwad, the MP will have to face action as per the law, Raut said.
