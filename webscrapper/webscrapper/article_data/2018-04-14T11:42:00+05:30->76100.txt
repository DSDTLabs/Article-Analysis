NEW DELHI: India’s boxing contingent continued its fine run in the 2018 Commonwealth Games. After Mary Kom secured her maiden   gold medal to kickstart the day, two more medals were added in the form of gold medallist  , who triumphed in the final of men’s 52kg, and   claiming silver in the 60kg category. Solanki's win brought India its 20th gold medal. 

 
 
 
 Solanki was on the attack from the word go, dominating the first two rounds against Irvine, before the Northern Irishman came back strongly in the final round. Solanki was eventually awarded the bout by a 4:1 split decision from the judges. It was a much improved performance from Solanki, who in the semifinal, recovered admirably from two knockdowns against Sri Lanka's Vidanalange Ishan Bandara.
 
 
 
 Kaushik put on a riveting effort in his final bout against Harry Garside, but in the end, the Australian was declared winner by the judges, who gave a 3:2 split decision. Last year, Kaushik had won a gold medal in the light weight division at the 2017 National Boxing Games and picked up another gold medal in his weight category in Asian Game Test Event held in Jakarta, Indonesia earlier this year. 
 
 Earlier in the day, it was veteran Indian boxer Mary who had delivered gold in the women's 46-48kg event.
