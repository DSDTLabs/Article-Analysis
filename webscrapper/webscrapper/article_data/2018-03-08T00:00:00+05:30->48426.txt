I have loved cinema since I was young. I never looked at cinema like the regular audience. I would instead observe the editing, rerecording and other technical aspects. Instead of discussing the actor or actress, I’d rather look at the filmmaking. Subconsciously, I knew that cinema was where I was headed. My family’s support has also been a big reason for me to follow my passion as my mother had always guided me to make a career in what I love, rather than just sit idle at home. 
 
 
 I naturally ended up studying cinema and it was over here that I began my career. I started out in the studio as a chorus singer, have been into rerecording and now have 15 films to my credit as a music  . I began with  , and have then worked in Taare, Nenapinangala and more. If you look closely, there are female technicians and directors that can be counted on one’s fingers. But those who are around, are very passionate and give their 100%. But, the problem lies in the fact that makers don't trust the female technicians fully. They give them 80% liberty, but still harbour a 20% doubt. This has to stop. 
 
 
 I've never been one to fight for gender equality. I believe both men and women come with their own skill sets and limitations. Among the younger, aspiring female technicians, I wish that they steer clear from distractions, especially the social media apps, and give a 100% to their craft.
