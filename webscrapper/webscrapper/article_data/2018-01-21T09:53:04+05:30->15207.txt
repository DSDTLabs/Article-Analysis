PUNE: The women and child development (WCD) department is set to provide   napkins at cheaper rates through various self-help groups (SHGs) outlets in the state.

 The department will rope in gram sabha and ASHA members to spread awareness about low-cost napkins in rural and urban areas, respectively.
 
 The move comes after the Bombay High Court sought a reply from the department in lieu of a petition filed by a Mumbai-based women’s group. The petition stated that nearly 80% of the women in India suffered due lack of awareness on sanitary napkins and their high market prices.
 
 “We have decided to involve various women SHGs that can provide cheaper sanitary napkins, besides spearheading the awareness programme. We will give full assistance to these groups,” said a WCD official.
 
 The court had also observed that it was important to address the issue of expensive sanitation aids. Sanitary napkins should be exempted from 12% Goods and Services Tax (GST), the court had noted.
 
 Meanwhile, the government had recently appointed a task force to monitor the manufacturing of menstrual hygiene aids for school girls.
 
 Apart from making menstrual hygiene education mandatory in schools, the state also plans to educate parents over the need for shunning taboos and superstitions associated with the natural bodily function.
 
 Schools in the state have been instructed to follow the extensive programme on menstrual hygiene education designed by UNICEF. The programme includes six exhaustive sessions conducted by hygiene experts, one every month.
 
 According to a UNICEF study, around 60 to 70% girls in the state drop out of school after they start menstruating.
