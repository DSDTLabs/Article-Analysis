HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday said it would depute a judicial officer to study the vexatious issue of encroachment of pavements and roads by shopkeepers at   and Mahabubganj areas in Hyderabad and obtain a report from him on the actual situation on the ground. 

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice M Ganga Rao asked the   sessions judge to depute a judicial officer for this purpose. The Hyderabad police and   officials were asked to assist the judicial officer. 
 
 Though the bench has been hearing a PIL on this matter, the shopkeepers are allegedly turning into law-abiding citizens when officials visit the area and are turning violators the moment they leave. They have been doing this despite undertakings given to the court assuring that they would not repeat their mistakes.
