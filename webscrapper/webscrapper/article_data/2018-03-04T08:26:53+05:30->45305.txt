AMRITSAR: An   (AAP) MLA has alleged that the cold shoulder welcome of Canadian Prime Minister   during his week-long India visit has not only revived the   but also endangered the prospects of Punjabis migrating to Canada.

 Phoolka, who is also a senior advocate is of view that the fallout of lukewarm welcome to Trudeau’s visit has not only internationalised the Khalistan issue but its repercussion could reflect on the prospects of Punjabis moving to Canada every year.
 
 “Khalistan issue had almost died down, but the manner in which government handled this, today Khalistan issue is being talked about at international level. In the past this issue has never got this much publicity”, said Phoolka in a release issued here on Saturday.
 
 Senior advocate informed that he had moved a resolution in the Punjab assembly and proposed that the assembly should thank people and government of Canada for providing homely atmosphere to people of Indian origin in Canada.
 
 “This resolution has been filed in the office of the assembly on March 1st 2018 and will be taken up in next session of assembly,” he said adding that he had also proposed that the assembly should pass recommendation to Punjab government to accord due respect to any high official or minister of Canada visiting Punjab.
 
 He alleged that due to ‘unthoughtful’ action of Punjab government that it had endangered prospects of about 80,000 to 90,000 Punjabis migrating to Canada every year. He informed that forty to fifty thousand youth from Punjab goes to Canada every year on study visa and equal number go on other visas. 
 
 “Canada is a superpower today and can help Punjab in the fields of education, health, farming, environment etc. Punjab has lost this opportunity” he said while questioning the government to explain inn the house why it had caused such a great damage.
