GHAZIABAD: A 30-year-old man allegedly shot himself with a country-made revolver outside the house of his former wife in   on Tuesday night. The deceased has been identified as Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri in Delhi.

 According to police, Pradeep went to meet Shabina around 9pm, but she did not open the door to let him in.
 
 Shabina (26), who works in a private company, started living with her parents in Manish Vihar after getting the divorce around a year back. “Pradeep left his scooter behind when he left home around 5pm. We received the information about the suicide around 9.30 pm,” Pradeep’s father, Shravan Kumar, told TOI. 
 
 Pradeep married his distant cousin Shabina (26) three years ago and both of them belonged to different communities. “Pradeep and Shabina had married in a court. We were opposed to this marriage because Shabina is the daughter of my wife’s sister. We’ve no idea when and why Pradeep went to meet her,” he added. Pradeep’s family members said he was an artisan who handcrafted figurines.
 
 Police sent the body for postmortem. “Pradeep shot himself in his head after he was denied entry inside the house of his in-laws. His father told us that Pradeep had earlier attempted suicide on three occasions,” said R K Singh, SHO, Loni police station, adding that a case will be registered in the matter under the Arms Act.
