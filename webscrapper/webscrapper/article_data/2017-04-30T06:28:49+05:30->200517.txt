  : The state unit of   staged a protest rally here on Saturday against China's renaming of six places in the state. Beijing claims the state as part of its territory, calling it southern Tibet. 

 Hundreds of BJP workers, led by state unit president Tapir Gao, took to the streets, raising anti-China slogans and carrying banners and placards. At the end of the protest rally - from Tennis Court at Indira Gandhi Park to the Raj Bhavan - the party submitted a memorandum to governor PB Acharya.
 
 "India has no boundary with China but only with Tibet," Gao said while talking to the media. "China's claim is baseless. China forcefully occupied Tibet in 1959 and now they want to expand their boundary up to Arunachal. It will not be accepted by the people of the state nor the BJP," he added. China has unilaterally renamed six places in   recently in an apparent retaliation against the Dalai Lama's visit to the state early this month, with experts saying the move is aimed at reaffirming Beijing's 'territorial sovereignty' over the region. "Renaming of places in   is baseless. Beijing forcefully occupied Tibet and their claim is meaningless," Gao said.
