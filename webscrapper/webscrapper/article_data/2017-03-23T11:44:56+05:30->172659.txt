CHANDRAPUR: Civic elections in   will be held on April 19 and results will be announced on April 21. State election commissioner J S Saharia announced in Mumbai that along with Chandrapur, Latur and Parbhani will also go to polls to elect their civic bodies. Code of conduct came into effect in the three places from Wednesday.

 The   ( ) came into being in 2011 and this will be its second election. In the first term itself, the nascent civic body saw political turmoil. Congress was the single largest party winning 26 seats in the 66-member house and formed a government with help of independents and smaller parties but it lasted only two-and-half years. 
 
 BJP, which had won 18 seats, engineered a split in the Congress whose 11 corporators defected and gave   control of the House.   had five members, NCP four and BSP, MNS and BRPBMS one each while ten independents held the key to power in the outgoing civic body.
 
 After the recent impressive win in Zilla Parishad elections, BJP looks more confident and, despite its internal rumblings, is more organized. Congress party is in no better position with factional fights that could lead to self-annihilation. State finance minister Sudhir Mugantiwar and Union minister   may not find it difficult to challenge the divided Congress.
 
 As per the poll schedule, election notification will be issued on March 27. Candidates can file nominations from March 27 to April 3 (though March 28 will be holiday for Gudipadwa, April 2 (Sunday) will be a working day.
 
 In the last term, the city was divided into 33 prabhags, each represented by two members. Now after delimitation, it will have 15 prabhags with four members each and two electing three corporators each.
