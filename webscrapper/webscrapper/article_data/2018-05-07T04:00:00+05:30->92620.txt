Vadodara: Increasing number of Barodians are taking ill due to scorching heat daily. According to 108 emergency services, 16 citizens suffered various ailments due to the rising temperatures on Saturday.  Four suffered from abdominal pain while three complained of chest pain as as many others fell unconscious. The 108 officials said that they have been getting maximum cases of abdominal pain and people falling unconscious due to heat.  Many citizens, especially the aged ones, have stopped venturing out on the city roads in noon to escape the heat. The sale of face masks and gloves too has gone up over last few days.  On Sunday, Vadodara recorded maximum temperature of 41.6°C.  Meanwhile, mercury soared above 40 degrees in at least 10 towns of the state. Surendranagar was the hottest place in the state with maximum temperature zooming to 43.5°C on Sunday. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), southwesterly to westerly winds prevailed over the state. The winds, laden with moisture from Arabian Sea, are known to bring down the heat, but they could make little difference in the temperature given the intensity of solar radiation. Heat was equally unbearable in the capital Gandhinagar, which is famed as the ‘greenest capital’ due its vast tree cover. Gandhinagar recorded 41.5°C maximum temperature while the minimum was 26°C. Coastal regions of the state were cooler than other regions with Surat (35.4°C), Valsad (34.9°C), Porbandar (35.6°C) and Mahuva (38.4°C) being much better off than Ahmedabad.  IMD forecast said that the mercury may soar in all parts of the state. “Maximum temperature is most likely to remain between 41°C and 43°C over North Gujarat region and in parts of Saurashtra-Kutch and South Gujarat region during next two days,” said IMD.
