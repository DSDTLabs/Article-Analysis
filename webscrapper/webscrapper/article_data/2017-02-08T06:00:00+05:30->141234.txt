Visakhapatnam: The regional passport office at Visakhapatnam said some unauthorised persons were posing as passport online service providers and approaching universities/colleges for filing up online forms and collecting exorbitant fees for the application. It has been noticed that they are charging Rs 1,000 more than the notified fees.

 According to passport officer NLP Choudary, a student applicant was cheated of Rs 2,500 by such fraudsters for filing an application.
 
 On interrogation, it was found that a person had visited the Maharaj Vijayaram Gajapathiraj College of Engineering, Vizianagaram and approached the college authorities for making online applications for students, Choudary said.
 
 On getting permission from the college authorities, they put up a camp at the college premises under the banner Passport Online Services for almost a week and made passport online applications for the students of the college. They charged Rs 2,500 per application for more than 200 applications, Choudary added.
 
 “Similar instances occurred in mid-2015 at Visakha Institute of Technology, Baba Institute and Vignan University and this is the fourth college in the list. Our office had already issued a press release in this regard during August 2015 cautioning all the institutions and students not to fall prey to such unscrupulous persons. All colleges are once again advised to be careful and cautious before allowing any such persons and in case of any suspicion may contact the office authorities in the following telephone no. 0891-2745747 or email at rpo.vizag@mea.gov.in,” Choudary said.
