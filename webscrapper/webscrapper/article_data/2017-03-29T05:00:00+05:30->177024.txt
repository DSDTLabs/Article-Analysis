Mannara Chopra, who plays a singer in her upcoming film  , is actually a bit of a singer herself. But playing the role on screen was a whole new ball game, she tells us. 
“I love singing for my friends and family. My sisters Priyanka (Chopra) and Pari ( ) too sing. 
 I guess it runs in the family (laughs). But playing a singer and lip-syncing songs on the sets was a completely different experience,” she shares. 
 In fact, when she auditioned for the role, she was just given five songs and asked to sing. “I had no idea what the role was. During the auditions last year, I was given five songs to sing in Telugu. I figured I got the role because 
 I picked up the language quickly. It was only later that I got to know my role is of a singer in the film,” says Mannara, who will play a cute and naive Telugu ammayi, Anjali in the film.
 “I love that Anjali has this great sense of responsibility towards her family. This role is nothing like anything I have done before, I’m sure the Telugu audience will see and love the new me,” enthuses the actress, who has be styled in Indo-Western fusion for the role. 
 “The styling given to me is amazing, so you’ll see me wearing Indo-Western clothes like long skirts, kurtis, scarfs and chiffon shrugs. I’m sure it will 
 become a trend among youngsters,” she says.
 But what she is most excited about is finding a life-time mentor in the film’s director  . “Working with Puri sir was of course a dream come true, but I also found a mentor in him. I usually move on from one film to another after its completion, but Puri sir will be my guide for life. And more than films or work, he’s somebody you can have a conversation with,” she tells us. 
 And how was it acting opposite a debutant? “Ishan is a superstar to watch out for. He’s a one take actor. I’m sure people will love him. ”
