VISAKHAPATNAM: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( ) in association with various NGOs and the city police will soon crack the whip on the begging mafia which involve children and often infants.

 Over three dozen   currently carry children while begging in core city limits and a group of rowdy-sheeters are said to be supporting them. 
 
 The organised team hire women and children for the illegal activity. Sources said the begging mafia collects up to Rs 40,000 daily in the city. The peak hours for begging are 8.30am to 10am and 5pm to 8pm.
 
 Gondu Seetaram, member of Visakhapatnam district unit of   and city convener of Child Labour Protection Forum, said they have information that beggars with children below three years of age roam near  , Railway Station, NAD Kotha Road, Gajuwaka, Maddilapalem and Satyam Junction.
 
 Seetaram said the children are hired from others for Rs 200 per day and women are also hired for doing the illegal activity. 
 
 “In nearly 90 per cent of the cases, there will be no blood relation between the begging woman and child. It will be a serious crime if we do not eliminate it at the earliest. They maintain a good network with smartphones and use WhatsApp to communicate easily if any enforcement agencies like us carry out raids,” Seetaram said, adding that all the beggars managed to escape during a raid at Satyam Junction recently.
 
 When contacted, GVMC commissioner M Hari Narayanan said the corporation’s   (UCD) wing with help of some NGOs were planning to keep a tab on the begging activity in the city as part of the smart city project.
 
 “We are preparing an action plan to keep a tab on the begging mafia. We will hold some meetings with the NGOs and even the police, who are most important to us to go ahead on our work due to security problems. We will mostly likely begin our action from May,” UCD project director D Srinivasan told TOI.
