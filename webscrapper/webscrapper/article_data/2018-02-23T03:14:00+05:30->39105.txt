Panaji:   Filipe Neri Ferrao has appealed to the faithful to pray for peace on February 23. He has requested people to observe Friday as a day of prayer and fasting for peace in the world, in communion with the Catholic Church worldwide.

 “Observing the ongoing socio-political tensions and violence prevailing in many countries of the world, the Pope has invited us to pray to God for the change of hearts, especially of those who are involved in these conflicts and of those who have power in these violence-ridden parts of the globe,” he stated in a circular sent to all parishes.
 
 The pope requested that prayers be raised for nations reeling under violence, especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Archbishop has urged Catholics during the ongoing Lenten season to “show solidarity and concern for others” in order to “bring people closer to God and to one another”.
