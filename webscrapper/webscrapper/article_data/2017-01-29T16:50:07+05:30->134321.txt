MUMBAI: The Congress corporator and former BMC opposition leader   joined the Shiv Sena on Sunday and alleged that it was the continuing 'dadagiri' of  , president of the Mumbai regional Congress committee that forced him to make this switch. 

 Amberkar who was known to be close to former Union minister and MP  , was associated with the Congress party since the last two decades and was also the opposition leader in the BMC before the current opposition leader Pravin Chheda took over from him. The differences between Kamat and Nirupam increased in the past few days despite civic polls a month away.
 
 "Sanjay Nirupam's 'dadagiri' tactics in the party were not ending. I felt that he was trying to trample upon the Marathi 'manoos' and their thoughts in every way. Therefore getting fed up of all this I decided to move on from the party. It feels bad to leave the Congress considering I have contested civic elections with a Congress ticket from since 1998, " Amberkar said. 
 
 However, TOI has also learned that Amberkar was being refused a ticket from the ward in Andheri where he has won in the past. "I was being asked to contest from another ward in Goregaon and Dindoshi area where I have no connection at all. I have worked for this ward and have various festivals which I celebrate therefore contesting from anywhere else was unacceptable to me, " added Amberkar.
 
 Meanwhile, Nirupam completely rubbished Amberkar's allegations. "I am not at all a part of the candidate selection procedure and it is all being handled at the district level by former MP's, MLA's and district presidents. Therefore it seems like someone is purposely asking my name to be taken by those who are leaving the Congress party and joining other parties," said Nirupam. 
 
 It is learned that the Shiv Sena promised Amberkar a ticket from the ward in seven bungalows at Andheri where he is keen on contesting from.
