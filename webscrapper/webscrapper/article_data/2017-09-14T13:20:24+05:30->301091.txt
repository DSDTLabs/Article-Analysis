NAGPUR: Peeved over inordinate delay in laying drainage line and beautification works at Shegaon, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the municipal council, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) and PWD to file individual affidavits spelling out reasons within two weeks.

 The move came after amicus curiae Firdos Mirza pointed out lack of coordination and ego problems between all three agencies that led to the delay.
 
 A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and   then asked the Amravati divisional commissioner to convene a meeting of all three heads of these agencies to sort out the disputes.
 
 The court was hearing a petition (WP No 5856/2007) by Shegaon citizens â€” Anandilal Bhutada and Suresh Jaipuriya.
 
 Earlier, Mirza informed that Mumbai-based Fortress Infrastructure Advisory Services, appointed as consultant for entire beautification project, failed to conduct proper survey of encroachers on the government land. He pointed out that many residents were found having legal property. He stated that the agency was charging Rs3 lakh per month for its services, but failed to give desired results.
 
 The judges then directed the Buldhana collector and municipal council to remove all encroachments with help of local police.
 
 The court also disposed of three petitions filed through Shreerang Bhandarkar by alleged encroachers at Khalwadi and  , after they agreed to abide by the government directives regarding compensation or alternate housing scheme. 
 
 On various occasions, the court directed government to complete developmental works with a view to accommodate large number of devotees.
