Following the recovery of a used syringe outside the room of a seasoned boxer at the Athletes’ Village on Friday, Indian athletes have been hit hard by the controversy with the   organisers targeting all arriving batches of Indians for dope testing.
 
 
 
 Here's everything you need to know about  's no-needle policy:
 
 • Needles must not be used except by medically qualified practitioners for treatment of injury, illness or other medical conditions (for which a valid TUE may be required) those requiring auto-injection therapy for an established medical condition with a valid TUE, e.g. for insulin dependent diabetes.
 
 
 
 
 
 • Every Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) must ensure that needles are stored in a central secured location, access to which is restricted to authorized medical personnel of the CGA delegation.
 
 • Athletes with a valid TUE for use of insulin, and nonathletes requiring other forms of auto-injection may keep appropriate materials with them if safely stored and disposed of in accordance with the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 • All used needles and associated materials (vials, syringes, and swabs) are disposed of in an appropriate bio-hazards container
 
 • Whenever an athlete receives an injection during the Games, the attached “Injection Declaration Form” (IDF) is duly completed and forwarded to the CGF Medical Commission no later than noon the day following such injection.
 
 • No IDF is required if the injection has been administered by a medically qualified practitioner from the CWG organising committee and the injection has been recorded. Acupuncture or the use of dry needling techniques is exempt from IDFs.
 
 • Failure to respect the policy or IDFs could lead to disciplinary action, sanctions and testing for the CGA and the athlete.
 
 • There is no medical justification for any athlete (except those with valid TUE), a coach or any other nonmedically qualified person to administer an injection.
