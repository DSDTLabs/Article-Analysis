CHENNAI: In one of the largest ever transfer of shares, over 39.6 crore shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) valued at around Rs 51,000 crore representing 12.58% of the paid-up capital of the company, changed hands on the BSE on Thursday through block deals in early morning trade. On an average, only 10.8 lakh shares were traded in the counter in the last two weeks. The RIL scrip retreated 0.35% to end the day at Rs 1,287.35 on the BSE. 

 RIL had informed bourses on March 2 that entities forming part of the promoter group of the company intend to acquire shares from other promoter group entities by way of ‘inter-se’ transfer aggregating up to 119 crore shares of the company.
 
 Promoters of listed companies have started to transfer shares among their group entities to enjoy benefits of long-term capital gains (LTCG), experts said. LTCG on shares and mutual funds will remain tax free now.
 
 Shares which promoters own prior to 2004 where STT (securities transaction tax) is not paid will not be eligible for LTCG after March 31. So, they are doing these transfers to ensure that they get LTCG benefits by paying STT before the new rules kick in.
 
 “The change in capital gain norms proposed in the February 2017 budget has forced internal transfer of shares by promoters,” market observers said. “It is proposed to amend section 10(38) to provide that exemption under this section for income arising on transfer of equity share acquired or on after 1st day of October, 2004 shall be available only if the acquisition of share is chargeable to Securities Transactions Tax,” the union budget said.
 
 The changes will not however affect IPOs, FPOs, bonus and rights issues as STT is not applicable on such acquisitions. The STT, which is a turnover tax that the investor pays on the total consideration paid or received for transactions in stock futures and options, was introduced in union budget 2004. STT is levied at 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.125% depending on the nature of the transaction. Gains from transactions in shares held for less than 12 months are subject to a short-term capital gains tax of 15%.
 
 Two entities in the RIL promoter group—Devarshi Commercials LLP and Tattvam Enterprises LLP—bought around 39.61 crore shares at Rs 1,283.25-Rs 1,284.62 per share pegging the transfer at around Rs 50,840 crore, BSE data on bulk deals showed. These firms owned a mere 100 shares in RIL at the end of December.
 
 Four promoter group firms — Taran Enterprises LLP, Abhayaprada Enterprises LLP, Trilokesh Commercials LLP and Adisesh Enterprises LLP — sold about 35.54 crore shares in the transfer. All but 100 shares have been offloaded from Taran, Abhayaprada and Trilokesh to other entities.
