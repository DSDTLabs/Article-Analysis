SHIMLA: Defying the Himachal Pradesh high court’s order to end their strike, the   collectors employed by the Shimla Environment, Heritage Conservation and Beautification (SEHB) Society continued to stayh away from work.

 
 On Saturday, the high court had observed that handful of employees cannot hold the city to ransom and more so, at this point in time, when the tourist season was at its peak. The court had also told the government to take action against employees who do not return to work. However, there was no action on Monday and situation continued to get worse.
 
 Meanwhile, CPIM protested outside the Shimla Municipal Corporation’s office on Monday.
