Dharamsala: It’s not often that you see a bowler of the class of   conceding as many as 96 runs in his 10 overs. It must have been worrying for the national selectors to see the India pacer being torn apart by the marauding   batsmen, even though the wicket was flat, while bowling for India A in their   match at the   here on Tuesday night. Perhaps, it’s time to consider the 27-year-old purely as a ‘Test specialist.’

 With Shami’s expensive figures sank India A’s hopes of making the final, since they desperately needed a big win to improve their net run rate, which had suffered a big dent when they suffered a crushing defeat against India B in the opener. Left with a tall ask of getting to 340 in 40.4 overs or less, they folded up for 274 to go down by 65 runs.
 
 
 India A’s young batting brigade of   (81, 70b, 14x4),   (73, 62b, 10x4, 1x6) and Prithvi Shaw (40, 34b, 8x4) all tried their bit, but it needed a magical innings to take their team through. For Karnataka, off-spinner   picked up four wickets, while seamer Ronit More took three.
 
 With their second win on the trot, Karnataka stormed into the final, where they’ll play India B on Thursday night. Earlier, choosing to bat first on a belter, the Vijay Hazare champs raced to 339 for four.
 
 While opener Mayank Agarwal, who was in blazing form coming into this tournament, was out again without putting much on the board (22),   (95, 87b, 8x4, 1x6) and Ravikumar Samarth (85, 87b, 8x4, 1x6), who had slammed a hundred just 24 hours earlier, added 129 (in 119 balls) for the third wicket to lay the platform for a big total. The final impetus was provided superbly by ‘keeper-bat CM Gautam (49 not out, 26b, 2x4, 4x6) and all-rounder Stuart Binny (37 not out, 24b, 3x4, 1x6), who smashed 72 in 37 balls during their unbeaten alliance for the fifth wicket.
 
 Brief scores: Karnataka 339-4 in 50 overs (Pawan Deshpande 95, Ravikumar Samarth 85, CM Gautam 49 not out) bt India A 274 in 39.5 overs (Unmukt Chand 81, Ishan Kishan 73, Prithvi Shaw 40; K Gowtham 4-52, R More 3-64) by 65 runs.
