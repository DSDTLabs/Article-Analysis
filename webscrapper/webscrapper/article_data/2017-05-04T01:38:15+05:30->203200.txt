Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray will be embarking on a ‘Sampark Yatra’ starting Saturday (May 6). They will be touring parts of the drought-prone   region to reach out to the farmers. 

 Shiv   has been pressurizing the state government to announce a   waiver for farmers. Sena, which is an ally in the state government, was also seen protesting and disrupting the proceedings of both the houses of the legislature, along with the opposition parties.
 
 According to the plan, Sena MLAs will be touring each electoral ward in Marathwada and will be talking to the farmers. On May 7, Uddhav and Aaditya will meet people and take stock of the situation between 2pm to 5pm at Sambhaji Nagar in Aurangabad.
 
 “After the tour, Shiv Sena is likely to up its ante against the government and use the findings from the tour to take on the government and press for their pending demand of a loan waiver,” said a senior Sena minister. Sena ministers also met Fadnavis on Tuesday demanding a special assembly session to address issues ailing farmers in the state.
