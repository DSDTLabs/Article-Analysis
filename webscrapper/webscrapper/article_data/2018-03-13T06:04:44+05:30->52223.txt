CHENNAI: Though trekking has grown in popularity as a form of adventure tourism, participants in such expeditions are seldom trained to handle emergency situations.

 While so, groups like   get participants to sign disclaimers thereby waiving them of responsibilities in the event of any injury or death.
 
 “(Forest) routes are tricky. In case of   range, it is a wild elephant corridor too. It may seem adventurous. But venturing into wild where there are no trails can become dangerous,” said  , a Chennai-based researcher and activist, works with forest dwellers in the Western Ghats. “Most trekkers lack fitness and struggle to walk the miles on a hilly terrain,” said   a regular trekker on the   ranges.
 
 But, according to members of Chennai Trekking Club, participants are selected only after being subjected to fitness tests. “We ask the interested members to climb up the Trisulam hills carrying a 10kg backpack in as little time as possible. It gives a fair idea about their stamina and fitness levels,” said a club member, not wanting to be named. 
 
 Trek leaders play an important role especially when leading a pack of amateurs into forest trails. Though leaders are experienced trekkers, they would still require the guidance of a local to move about forest trails. “Unfortunately, trek leaders only have theoretical training to deal with an emergency,” Ramya added.
