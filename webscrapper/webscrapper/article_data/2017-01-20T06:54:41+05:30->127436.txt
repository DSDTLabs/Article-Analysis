JAMMU: Jammu & Kashmir assembly on Thursday unanimously passed the resolution for the return of displaced Kashmiri Pandits and others migrants to the Valley.

 The move, however, was opposed by   who termed it as "politicisation" of the issue.
 
 Leader of the opposition   said 27 years had passed since the Kashmiri Pandits migrated from the Valley and a conducive atmosphere should be created for their return. He also said the House should rise above politics and bring resolution on their return.
 
 Minister for road and buildings and parliamentary affairs in   government, Abdul Rehman Veeri, welcomed the suggestion and agreed to it. After question hour, speaker Kavinder Gupta moved the resolution which was passed by voice vote. The House also witnessed heated exchange of words between Rashid and BJP MLAs Sat Sharma and Ravinder Raina.
 
 Justifying his objection, Rashid said, "The passing of resolutions won't solve the issues. No   will return by just passing a resolution. They should initiate a political recourse." He asked if the government or National Conference have ever had a discussion with any group to understand the plight of Kashmiri Pandits.
