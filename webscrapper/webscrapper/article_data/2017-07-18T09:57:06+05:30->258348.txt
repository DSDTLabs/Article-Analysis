NEW DELHI: Ignoring the Supreme Court’s prod to provide a fresh window to those who could not exchange scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes by last December 30 because of genuine difficulty, the Centre on Monday firmly said that no new opportunity would be given for the exchange of the outlawed currency as it could be misused.Centre on Monday firmly said that no new opportunity would be given for the exchange of the outlawed currency as it could be misused.

 “The very object of   and elimination of black money will be defeated if a window is opened for further period as the persons in possession of scrapped currency notes would have had sufficient time and opportunity to carefully plan the reasons and excuses for not depositing them by the December 30 deadline,” the finance ministry told the court through an affidavit.
 
 “Going by the extent and enormity of malpractices observed during the post-demonetisation period, it is apparent that in case a fresh opportunity is offered for exchange of specified bank notes, it would lead to rampant illegal trading of these notes (they being traded at a discount),” the Centre added.
