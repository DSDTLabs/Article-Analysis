NAGPUR: The much awaited   (GBBC) will take place from February 17-20. Over 1,150 birders from India are expected to take part.

 GBBC is a global event and last year in India, 1,105 birders took part and uploaded 7,908   lists documenting 785 species. Globally, India stood third in online documentation and first in number of species.
 
 Bird expert and honorary wildlife warden of Amravati Jayant Wadatkar said along with GBBC, the annual Campus Bird Count (CBC), a sub-event of the GBBC-India, will also take place this year.
 
 Wadatkar has appealed to the students to register and participate in the count. “In Maharashtra,   in the count, of which 14 are in Vidarbha,” he added.
 
 In Vidarbha, the count will be launched by various coordinators in Amravati, Akola, Washim, Nagpur, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Wardha, Bhandara and Chandrapur. For details, bird watchers can get information from www.birdcount.in.
 
 Wadatkar has appealed to citizens to go birding for at least 15 minutes, list and count all the species they see. “It doesn’t matter if you can’t identify every single species — what you can identify is good enough. One can login to www.ebird.org/india and submit species list,” he added.
