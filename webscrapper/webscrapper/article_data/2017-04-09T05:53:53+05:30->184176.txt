Then he was beaten repeatedly on the back,” she said. 
 
 The family protested in front of the police station, cursing the cops and throwing mud at them. The police had to close the gates to prevent the protesters from entering the station. “We demand action against the policemen responsible for Ramu’s death. I was told that Ramu collapsed at the station. We went and brought him home and a little later he died,” Ramu’s wife Rajini said.

 DCP North Zone B Sumathi said the deceased was reportedly starving for three days due to the row. “He was a diabetic and complained of giddiness at home, which may be the cause of his death. There were no injuries as alleged by the family. Forensic experts said they would give the report after receipt of histopathology report and analysis from the State Forensic Lab,” she said.
