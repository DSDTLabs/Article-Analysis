BENGALURU: While the state government has, by and large, promoted organ donation, it took a few hospitals by surprise last week by banning the transplant of a kidney between a particular donor and a recipient. Neither of them is related, which made the case even more perplexing. 

 On April 10, the health and family welfare department shot off a letter to hospitals which have authorized transplant panels, to put on hold a particular transplant. The intended recipient, a man, is a defence personnel, while the willing donor, a 48-year-old woman from  , is his friend. The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, states that hospitals concerned should put the transplant "on hold". It enumerated many reasons, one of which was that the woman had not obtained consent from her family, "which is mandatory as per Rule 7 (3) (ix) of the Rules 2014". 
 
 However, sources say the donor is a sibling of an IAS officer - a fact confirmed by the   - and that the officer had allegedly misused her clout to get fellow officers in the state to stop the donation.
 
  "The government has been used as a tool to solve a familial problem," a source said. "The letter was issued before the patient approached the organ transplant authorisation panel. The woman shed 14kg in the last five months to be eligible to  . She is not financially dependent on her sister (the IAS officer) as stated in the government's letter." 
 
 They also dispute the rule requiring consent of family mandatory. "The rule mentioned by the health department does not hold good in her case," sources said. "The rule says that if required the committee can consult the donor's relatives. It is not mandatory."
 
 Dr  , director, health and family welfare department, admitted the transplant was put on hold at the request of a principal secretary from  . "We were told that the donor lacks mental awareness. However, we have not stopped the donation."
