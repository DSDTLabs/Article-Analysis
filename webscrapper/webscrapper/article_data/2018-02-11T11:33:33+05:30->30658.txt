KOCHI: V Joseph  , fondly remembered as the architect of   international stadium in Kochi, had made several key contributions to Kochi’s development. His conviction and determination ensured that many projects in Kochi were completed in a timebound manner.

 When K Karunakaran was the chief minister, he called Thomas and gave him the job of constructing an international stadium in Kaloor. “He was a person known for his perseverance. Once, he took up a project, he would work hard until it materialized. The Jawaharlal Nehru international stadium is one example of his determination and efficiency. He had no qualms in going that extra mile to fulfil a dream project,” said former mayor CM Dinesh  , who is also a   state committee member.
 
 The land where the stadium is located was owned by Kerala Water Authority (KWA) and acquisition of land was a difficult task. Before taking over the land, KWA had to be given an alternative land parcel.
 
 Later, land was identified in the Palluruthy area and KWA’s installations were shifted to that region, thus paving the way for the construction of the stadium.
 
 “A countdown board was erected at site of stadium construction. Thomas ensured that the work never went behind the schedule,” Mani said.
 
 It was during his stint as the managing director of Kerala Books and Publications Society that the public sector undertaking underwent key changes and became modernized.
 
 “Construction of retaining walls and beautification of Thevara-Perandoor canal was carried out by him. During his period as GCDA chairman, he also carried out a lot of projects which the city showcased with pride,” said KJ Sohan, a former corporation employee.
 
 Beautification of Marine Drive was another stellar project he undertook. It was during his term as GCDA chairman that pension scheme for employees were mooted. He gave recommendation to the state government to give pension to GCDA employees.
