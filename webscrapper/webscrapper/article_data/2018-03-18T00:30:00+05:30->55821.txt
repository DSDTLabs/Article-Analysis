Bengaluru: Having brought the issue of granting minority status to the Lingayat community to a stage where the nod has to be given by the state government or referred to the Centre, the cabinet meeting on Monday is likely to put it in the back burner.

 Congress sources said the government is concerned about growing opposition from Veerashaiva seers, a divide in the cabinet among the Lingayat ministers over the issue and apprehension by the minorities that they will have to share the reservation quota. 
 
 “The high command will not approve matters which will erode the Ahinda votebank. This is also the same reason why the government is hedging over implementing the Sadashiva committee report on granting internal reservation among the scheduled castes,’’ sources said.
 
 According to Congress insiders, the Lingayat issue was expected to benefit only some districts in north Karnataka. By taking a decision on the expert panel recommendation to grant minority status to Lingayats, Congress candidates in these districts have to tackle not only their opponents from other parties but also those opposed to the issue, they added. 
 
 “With the issue of giving minority tag to Lingayats and those demanding that Veerashaivas and Lingayats are one and the same being spearheaded by ministers themselves, it will be prudent to give it a quietus burial. The issue at the most generated a momentum,’’ sources added.
