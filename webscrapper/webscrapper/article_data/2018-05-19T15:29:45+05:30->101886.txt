The Curse of   is based on the Virata Parva of the Mahabharata that describes the life of the Pandavas in the final incognito year of their exile. Arjuna, the middle Pandava, described as a great warrior, but each major victory of his against warriors like Bheesma, Drona, Bhagadatta, Jayadratha, Bhoorishravas, Karna all came with deception and trickery. There is one incident that Arjuna is party to, which changes his perspective completely, and that is the curse of Urvashi.
