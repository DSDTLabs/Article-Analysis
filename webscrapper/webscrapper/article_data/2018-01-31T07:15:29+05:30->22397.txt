NEW DELHI: In a first, railways has sent 100 employees — not senior officers but gangmen, trackmen and other non-gazetted employees — for a six-day leisure trip to Singapore and Malaysia.

 The workers from Secunderabad-based South Central Railway (SCR) flew out on Sunday. The employees had to pay only 25% of the expenditure, with the rest paid from the staff benefit fund (SBF), said an official.
 
 “The 100-strong group of employees... comprised   employees, with preference given to employees from lower cadres and those nearing retirement. Allocation of number of slots for each division, workshop and headquarters was given on the basis of their sanctioned strength,” he added.
 
 The SCR has taken the lead in “optimising welfare activities for its non-gazetted workforce by organising the first-of-its-kind ‘Employees Overseas Camp’ on Indian Railways”, said a statement.
 
 The itinerary covers tourist sites such as  , Sentosa and Night Safari in Singapore, and   Towers, Batu Caves and   in Malaysia.
 
 SBF funds are allocated by the railway board for welfare activities aimed at non-gazetted employees. They are usually used for scholarships, to benefit the girl child, camps for children and other such socially relevant causes, an official said.
