 Chief managing director of Paarth Infrabuild Pvt Ltd, PN Mishra said, “Every year sops are announced for affordable housing. But nothing improves on the ground. We have undertaken two affordable projects in Allahabad and Lucknow. Though we have completed the formalities, we are yet to get benefits from government. Government should work on effective execution.”

A lot of families do not prefer to stay in government schemes. With easy financing to developers doing affordable buildings, we will be able to supply units in the range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh,” said Garg.
