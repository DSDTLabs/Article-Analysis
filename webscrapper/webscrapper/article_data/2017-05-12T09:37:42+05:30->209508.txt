HYDERABAD: Tuesday’s hailstorm was followed by a small   on the   of   minister K T Rama Rao. While the minister replied to most by asking officials to attend to the problem area, one of this replies left a complainant stumped.

 Masab Tank resident Mohd Sadiq Ahmed Khan had posted pictures of ‘uprooted trees’ and asked KTR to immediately depute officials to clear it. But from the photographs it was evident that there were only two tree branches that could be moved aside by almost anyone.
 
 KTR’s response was in a similar vein. “Don’t get me wrong but why can’t you & your friends try & do some basic clean-up instead of leaving it for GHMC. After all it’s our city,” he responded.
 
 Within minutes, there was a groundswell of support for the minister. One Riyazuddin responded saying he would clear it himself. “Please tell me the exact location. I am on the way to office. I will clean it and go,” Riyazuddin said. “It is our city, we also need to do something about it,” he said reacting to the minister’s response. “People have lost a sense of civic duty,” Sravan K commented.
