BENGALURU: The   party has received as many as 1,570 applications for tickets to contest the 224 assembly seats. Sources say this is much higher compared to the response the party generated in 2013 — it recieved just over 1,000 applicants — when the BJP was led by then chief minister  .

 In early preparation for polls, the   had called for applications as it planned to finalise the list of candidates by March.
 
 The last date of submission of applications was March 5, but it was extended to March 12 under pressure from some party workers. The first election meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.
 
 “Of the 2,650 applications forms taken, we have received 1,570 applications from party workers,” said a Congress leader who is in-charge of scrutinizing applications. The party has also roped in a private agency to verify credentials of new applicants.
 
 The party received fewer applications in the constituencies of incumbent ministers and from KPCC chief G Parameshwara’s constituency. “The number of applications from constituencies where we have sitting MLAs were about four on an average,” party sources said.
 
 The highest number of applicants is from Ballari City, Arsikere, Chamarajpet, Sindagi, Chitradurga and Khanapur constituencies — ranging between 12 and 35.
 
 “Over 200 women party workers have also applied for poll tickets,” sources said adding that there was also good response for the SC and ST reserved seats.
 
 The applicants include family members of prominent leaders such as Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra and H C Mahadevappa’s son S C Bose among others.
 
 KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao said the overwhelming response indicates that the party is on a good wicket and this is also because the workers sense the party has a good chance of making retaining power. “ It is indeed a positive and encouraging sign,” he said.
