BHOPAL: Integrated ambulance 108 service is headed for another showdown with its employees. 108 service has about 700 vehicles that provide lifesaving services in 51  . 

 
  108 ambulance service is operated by private company   (ZHL) which claims that about 300 employees were replaced as they did not join active duty. However, ousted employees refute ZHL claim and their ultimatum to reinstate ousted employees ends on Friday. "480 employees have been removed. For a month, many were not called for duty," said one of the affected employees  . 
 
 In April, many of the vehicle pilots and paramedic support staff went off work demanding timely pay and implementation of other service rules. The matter was deemed as resolved after intervention of the labour commissioner. "In spite of clear orders of maintaining a status quo from the assistant labour commissioner, 300 out of a total of 3,000 employees had abandoned the ambulances and not reported to duty as specified to them," claimed   Jitendra Sharma.
