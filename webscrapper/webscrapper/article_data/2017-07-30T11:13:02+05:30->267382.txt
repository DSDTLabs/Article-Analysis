Rohit Kumar, the captain of the Bengaluru kabaddi team, couldn’t be happier. While the team was practising in Bengaluru, Rohit had told   that actor   is his idol — and talk isn’t shallow, for Rohit sports a tattoo of the actor on his shoulder.

 Telling us about why he idolizes the   star, Rohit had told us, “I am not a fan; Akshay Kumar is my idol and I am inspired by him. He does a lot of good work and his movies also have good messages. He’s a sportsman and is extremely fit. There’s a lot to learn from him. I am extremely motivated by him. I’ve been waiting since childhood to meet him, and perhaps I will be able to do that in this season of the league.”
 
  
  
 
 And it seems that the actor was listening, since Akshay paid Rohit a surprise visit in Nagpur recently (Bengaluru matches are being played in Nagpur this year). The actor not only interacted with namma captain, but also took pictures with him — the one, with the actor standing beside his tattoo is certainly one for the album.
