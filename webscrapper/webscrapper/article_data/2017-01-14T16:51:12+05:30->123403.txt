BEIJING: China has asked its officials to adopt plans to cut emissions and mitigate pollution as smog is again likely to hit central and northern parts of the country.

 The smog, which will return to Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan provinces, is expected to last until a cold front comes to the rescue around Thursday, the ministry said.
 
 The   (MEP) in the affected regions were asked to adopt plans to cut emissions and mitigate pollution.
 
 The environment ministry will send inspection teams to check implementation of the plans, state-run   news agency reported.
 
 Despite government efforts to fight pollution, outbreaks of smog have become increasingly common in winter in northern China where cold weather conditions and the burning of coal for heating combine to exacerbate the situation.
 
 Earlier, the government came under severe criticism when officials failed to enforce red alerts after Beijing and several other cities were enveloped by the worst smog allowing the factories to continue production.
 
 After that Beijing announced formation of environmental police to enforce rules during smog days.
 
 Severe smog triggered alerts in more than 20 cities at the beginning of the new year.
 
 When authorities issue red alerts, some manufacturers are required to cut production, and heavily polluting vehicles are banned from the roads.
 
 In environment inspections last year, the MEP said a total of 720 people were detained and 6,454 held accountable for environment-related wrongdoing.
 
 In 2016, the government refused 11 high-pollution and high-energy consuming projects, involving total investment of 97 billion yuan (about USD 14 billion).
 
 Partly due to those efforts, Chinese cities reported less than PM 2.5 pollution in 2016, with the average density of PM 2.5 in 338 cities falling by 6 per cent.
 
 China is aiming for a 10-per cent reduction in air emissions from 2012 levels by 2017 in cities at the prefecture level and above.
