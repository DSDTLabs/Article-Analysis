MUMBAI: The   has told the Bombay high court that while it has completed 95% of widening and deepening of  , some 36 low-lying areas within its limits may see little relief during the coming monsoon.

 The civic body was responding to a PIL by advocate Atal Dubey which sought corrective steps after the June 2015 deluge brought Mumbai to a halt. He raised the issue about improper rain water drainage system at various places which results in water logging.
 
 BMC's affidavit filed by the deputy municipal commissioner (zone VI) said in two phases the nearly 18-km long river, which carries overflows of Vihar and Powai lakes on the outskirts of  , has been widened from 6 mt to 60 mt and nearly Rs 660 crore was spent on various works related to the river. But this will not help water logging in 36 low lying areas within its limits where sea water enters the drainage system, causing a wall effect and prevents drainage of rain water during high-tide.
 
 BMC has said it is “practically difficult“ to undertake regular desilting of the Mithi to its bed level river due to regular sedimentation of silt and other floating material brought in by tidal water brought in from   up to the airport.Also, a major portion of the retention wall to be built is held because of enrcroachments on both its banks.
 
 The affidavit says BMC has also undertaken widening and deepening of other rivers.
