 The protestors from Trade Union Council,  , who were joined by members from All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and Center for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) reached near the Mini Secretariat on late afternoon. They held out a march around the Old Railway Road and near Beri Wala Bagh and raised slogans demanding justice. Heavy police deployment was made in the area and cops were called from the police lines too besides the local police station. The workers told TOI that many companies have sent their contractual staff on long leaves, while salary cheques too bounced in many cases.
 
 “The workers in Gurgaon, Manesar, Dharuhera and Bawal have been affected by demonetisation. Our colleagues have been sent on long leaves and no one knows by when will they be reinstated or get another job,” said Baldev Singh, state president AITUC.
 
 “Their salaries have been deposited to the bank accounts. But it would take a whole day to stand in the bank queues to withdraw that amount. Also, not all workers have smart phones or access to internet for digital payments. How are they suppose to manage their finances?” said Satvir Singh, member, CITU.
 
 The workers alleged that the demonetisation have shaken them and their families to the core. They met deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh and handed over a memorandum of their demands. Incidentally, their demands included the reinstating of the contractual workers who were recently sent on long leaves by Hero Motocorp Limited.
 
 “The workers have some issues that they want us to resolve. We have taken a note of their concerns and will see how the same can be resolved,” said deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh.
