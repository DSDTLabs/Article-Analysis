Vadodara: Four days after his arrest, M S University on Wednesday issued suspension order of professor Pradeep Singh Choondawat, the dean of Faculty of Arts, who was arrested on Saturday in connection to the recruitment scam at Jai Narayan Vyas University (JNVU) in Jodhpur.

 The university has also removed Choondawat from the deanship of the faculty, apart from relieving him from all the charges that he was holding including that of Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya. 
 
 “We have taken legal opinion in the matter. As per ordinance 31 of M S University handbook, if anyone remains in prison for 48 hours, he or she is deemed suspended. According we have issued the orders,” said Neerja Jaiswal, officer on special duty (registrar) at MSU, adding that professor K Krishnan, who is vice-dean of the faculty has been appointed as officiating dean. 
 
 The university officials, however, added that if Choondawat gets bail and submits an application to the university requesting to revoke his suspension orders, the university will have to rethink the suspension. 
 
 Jodhpur’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) arrested Choondawat for his alleged role in the JNVU recruitment scam. 
 
 Choondawat in 2012 was invited as an external expert in a selection committee for appointments at sociology department of JNVU. He was introduced to three candidates before the interviews were conducted and was told to ask them specific questions and select them for the post of assistant professor which he allegedly did.
