Rajkot: Unable to fulfil the dowry demand by her paramour, a 30-year-old woman committed suicide by hanging herself to death at her residence at Azad Chowk in Jangaleshwar area of Rajkot on Tuesday night. Police identified the deceased as Shital Makwana. 

 Police have booked Makwana’s paramour  , his father Praful and his mother Viju, all residents of   quarters in Budhnagar of Jangaleshwar for abetment to suicide. 
 
 “Makwana and Chandapa were in love and were to get engaged. However, Chandapa’s parents demanded Rs 5 lakh dowry, which Makwana’s parents refused. When her parents asked her to get married elsewhere, Makwana met Chandapa, who insisted on paying off the dowry. Makwana said she would have to end her life if she was married elsewhere. To this, Chandapa told her to end her life. Frustrated and depressed by this, Makwana ended her life,” said an official from   police station. 
 
 The complaint in this regard has been lodged by Makwana’s brother Bahadur Makwana.
