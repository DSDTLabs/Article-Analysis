KOLKATA: Acting on the basis of a   complaint about a 24-year-old woman being allegedly teased, stalked and molested while returning from work on Tuesday night,   arrested five persons on Thursday.

 In the post written on Bidhannagar City Police's Facebook page, the complainant alleged that one of her family members was stalked by a group of youths as she took a footbridge from 206 bus stand in Salt Lake to Keshtopur around 9.30pm. "The youths called her by names and were speaking among themselves about ways to molest and torment her. As she ran fast, the youths blocked her path. She somehow pushed them and started running through the lanes of Keshtopur as the youths chased her in a car. She somehow entered the home of a stranger and stayed inside till the youths went out of sight. The stranger then dropped her home," the complaint read. The complainant also mentioned that the girl was in shock.
 
 The post was made around 3am on Wednesday and cops swung into action. Based on the girl's statements, they conducted a search and arrested five suspects - Biswajit Majumdar, Kishore Biswas, Abhishek Das, Abhishek Bachar and   - all in their twenties. 
 
 "The youths are residents of Keshtopur and do not have proper jobs. We have even seized the white Hyundai Verna on which the youths had chased the girl. The car belongs to Biswajit," said S Rajkumar, deputy commissioner (detective department) of Bidhannagar Police. The youths, booked under IPC sections of stalking, wrongful restraint and molestation, will be produced before a Salt Lake court on Friday.
