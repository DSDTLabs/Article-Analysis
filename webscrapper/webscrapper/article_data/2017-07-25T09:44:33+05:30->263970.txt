BAREILLY: Two days after TOI reported that MPs and MLAs would be provided a separate lane at toll plazas giving them an   during traffic congestions, the UP government has now issued a fresh advisory to all district magistrates across the state saying its earlier order "created a lot of confusion" and that it stands revised.
 
  The latest advisory, issued on Monday by additional chief secretary Sadakant, stated that there would be no arrangement of providing a special lane to public representatives at toll plazas. He further directed officials that the order issued earlier, also by him, has been "revised with immediate effect".
  
  In a clarification issued on Monday, the UP government said, “It’s to be noted that only general facilities available to all at toll plazas will be available for people’s representatives too. An earlier advisory issued in this regard henceforth stands amended.”
  
  The additional chief secretary’s earlier order dated July 15 had raised eyebrows among public as well as bureaucracy. In a letter to district magistrates, Sadakant had said that as per rules notified by the Centre, no road toll would be charged from any MLA or MLC of the UP assembly, or MPs from the state. And that "All district magistrates will ensure that toll plazas under their jurisdiction will provide a separate lane to MPs and MLAs in the event of traffic jams". The letter also said that authorities of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) were expected to cooperate in the matter.
  
  The order was not received enthusiastically among bureaucrats. A senior official had said on the one hand the government has declared that it wanted to curb  by removing blue beacons, and on the other it was passing such orders which would reinforce VIP culture.
