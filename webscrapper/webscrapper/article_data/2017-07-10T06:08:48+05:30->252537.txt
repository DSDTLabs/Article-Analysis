KOLKATA: The kin of Krishnapada Das (75), who died on Friday morning at a Topsia nursing home after suffering a stroke on July 3, donated his skin for the treatment of burn victims. 

 Initially, the plan was to donate the organs of Das, who was a retired government employee and a social worker, with the assumption that he would have a brain death. "My mother Birala supported us when I, along with my sister Manasi and elder brother Jayanta, planned the donation," said Das' son Narayan. However, things did not go as planned as Das had a cardiac death, said additional DHS Aditi Kishore Sarkar. Moreover, his eyes had ulcer, making them unsuitable for donation. 
 
 Finally, Swasthya Bhavan decided to go ahead with skin donation after the body was accepted by  's anatomy department. "We have procured 1.5 square feet of his skin and will use it in grafting surgeries of burn patients. The amount of skin procured can help save an adult or two babies with burns. The body will also be used for dissection," Sarkar said.
 
 A doctor of the plastic surgery department at SSKM Hospital said that their freezer normally allows preservation of skin for 45 days. There is a demand for skin for the burn patients admitted in the hospital and Das' skin is likely to be used soon.
