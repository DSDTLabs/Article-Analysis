NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the dispute between Haryana and Delhi over sharing of   water should be adjudicated by the Upper Yamuna River   which is a statutory body set up to decide such issues.

 
 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Navin Sinha questioned the Delhi government for approaching the court and the National Green Tribunal with its grievances on   sharing and asked it to file its plea before the board which is the appropriate forum to decide the controversy.
 
 A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed by the five basin states in 1994 for sharing of Yamuna water. Clause 7(iii) of the MoU said allocation of water among the beneficiary states would be regulated by the UYRB within the overall framework of the agreement.
 
 The Yamuna originates in Yamunotri Glacier in the Himalayas and traverses the states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Delhi before flowing into the Ganga. The stretch of the river from its origin to Okhla in Delhi is called Upper Yamuna. The board was set up to regulate supply of water from all storages and barrages up to and including Okhla barrage.
 
 Accepting the SC’s suggestion, DJB, which approached the apex court against Haryana, withdrew its plea. Meanwhile, the Haryana government assured the court it would maintain status quo on supply of Yamuna water to Delhi till May 21.
 
 The Delhi government contended that Haryana was supplying Delhi only 330 cusecs of water per day as against 450 cusecs per day which was agreed upon between the two sides. It said the situation would “escalate” as the temperature rose with the onset of summer and the demand for drinking water shot up.
 
 “Haryana is defying the SC’s directions to supply drinking water at Wazirabad reservoir. It has converted Yamuna in Delhi into a dry river having virtually no water and, consequently, no water is available for treatment at Wazirabad,” the DJB said in its petition.
