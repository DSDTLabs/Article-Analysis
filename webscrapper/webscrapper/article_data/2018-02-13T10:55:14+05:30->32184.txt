KOCHI: Shortage of motor vehicle enforcement officials and absence of regular inspections result in increase in traffic violations in   rural, claimed motor vehicles department ( ) officials.

 The department had conducted a special drive from January 29 to February 4 this year.
 
 Of the total 405 traffic violations, 333 were reported in rural areas falling under   regional traffic office. The rest was in Ernakulam area. Officials attribute it to the shortage of officials for conducting regular inspections.
