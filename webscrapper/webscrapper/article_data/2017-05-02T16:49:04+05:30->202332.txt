KOLKATA: In a bid to increase blood donations in the state, a Kolkata-based forum   is offering free VIP access passes to Durga puja to all those who participate in mega donation camp at   on June 4.

 On the lines of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's famous slogan, "give me blood, I'll give you freedom", the organisers have come up with Maa er jonyo roktodan (  for the Mother). 
 
 The move, though appreciated by some, is facing backlash from both locals and authorities.
 
 "It's unethical to lure someone to donate blood," President of Kolkata medical bank D Asish said while criticising the move.
 "Blood donation is considered a noble job around the world. But exchange of money in lieu of donating blood is a criminal offence as per the Indian law.
 
 Citing a report from rom NACO, Asish said that once West   stood in the second place in blood donation but now it has gone down to 13th position.
  
 Meanwhile, the state health department has termed the move as "competition between clubs".
 
 "To curb this competition between clubs in attracting blood donors, the government has decided that the (health) department will not accept blood from organisations offering gifts for blood donation," a release from the   department said.
 
 However, the organisers claim offers to honour blood donor for the effort.
 
 "To encourage and as a token of appreciation VIP puja passes will be given to the donors," Saswata Basu, secretary Durgostav, said.
 
 "The passes are not gifts...those who donate blood are VIPs in true sense and we want to honour their effort. Donors can visit almost 200 pandals in the city along with their family," he added.
 
 In Kolkata, biggest blood donation camp is organised by IFA in memory of the 16 spectators who died in the Mohunbagan-Eastbengal match and over 1200 people donate blood every year. Apart from this CAB also organises donation camp every year.
