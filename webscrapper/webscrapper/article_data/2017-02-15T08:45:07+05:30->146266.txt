LUCKNOW: Out to campaign for Samajwadi Party candidate and cabinet minister  , chief minister   Yadav had little difficulty wooing the crowd on Tuesday evening in Aliganj. Along with his wife Member of Parliament  , Akhilesh addressed a massive gathering at the   crossing in Aliganj.

 The national president of SP, apart from listing down the schemes and achievement of his government, emphasised he was the only leader who focused on traffic management, a local issue which affects public on a daily basis.
 
 “We have done a lot of development work and most of it in Lucknow. I was an under-trainee chief minister as it was my first tenure. Give me another chance and you will see the transformation we can bring in your city,” said Yadav.
 
 Known for not letting any opportunity go without airing his thoughts on the subject, Akhilesh said Abhishek Mishra had insisted on bringing Dimple Yadav along for the meeting. “There could not have been a better day to step out with wife,” said Yadav referring to Valentine’s Day. The crowd responded with thunderous applause on the comment. Akhilesh had held a rally at the same spot five years back. “The turnout was less than half then,” he said.
 
 The couple stood by Anurag Bhadauria, who is contesting from Congress ticket from Lucknow East and has support of SP party. Akhilesh said if prime minister Narendra Modi visits Kannauj and see the works his government has done, he would press cycle symbol in UP polls too. Abhishek Mishra highlighted how he managed to build seven flyover/railway over bridges in the constituency in a record time.
