PUNE: The state government’s May 1 deadline for online   of   (7/12 extract of land) has been pushed further by three months.

 With nearly 3 crore entries to be put up online, the work of only 280 talukas out of 358 has completed, so far. The project is currently facing the issue of incorrect or misspelt names been entered into the database. This will now be corrected manually.
 
 Settlement commissioner and director of land records S   admitted the errors and said they will be addressed through the correction process in the coming month. “The government has given three-month extension for the   updation process. Even if we are not able to complete the work of all the talukas, we will put up the corrected entries of the 280 talukas by August,” he assured.
 
 The process of updation of record of rights was taken up by the state government to reduce frauds in property deals and ensure that all records are made available online.
 
 However, the process faced huge challenges as it required trained hands, Internet access and laws aligned to accommodate the changes. Due to all these challenges, revenue officials had even gone on strike several times. Many of them even expressed fears of losing the data due to the “mammoth” task since the software was not working properly. 
 
 The project is expected to ready a database for the land records department, sub-registrar offices and tehsil offices. They will eventually be connected for real-time data sharing and computerised 7/12 extracts given to land owners. 
 
 Meanwhile, the officials admitted that once the digitisation process is over, it will ensure reduction in procedures, litigation and red-tapism while bringing about ease of doing business for industries.
