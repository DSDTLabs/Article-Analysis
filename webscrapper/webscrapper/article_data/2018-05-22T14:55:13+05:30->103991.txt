LUCKNOW: The swearing-in ceremony of   on Wednesday will make history with two former chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh—Samajwadi Party’s   and BSP supremo   — will share a public platform for the first time.

 Mayawati on Monday confirmed her participation at Kumaraswamy’s swearing-in, after the CM-designate personally extended an invitation to her in Delhi. SP president Akhilesh Yadav has already confirmed his participation.
 
 BSP had extended support to SP days before the Gorakhpur and Phulpur byelections in March this year and the two parties are likely to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as allies.
 
 “Kumaraswamy met Mayawati on Monday evening and invited her for the swearing-in. Her participation has been confirmed and arrangements for her stay in Bengaluru are being made,” said a party source.
 
 SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary told TOI that party national president Akhilesh Yadav had also confirmed his participation in the event.
