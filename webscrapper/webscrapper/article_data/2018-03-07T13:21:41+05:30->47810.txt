ARA: The   has decided to introduce   at different points in the town from March 8 to address the issue of perennial traffic problem here.

 District magistrate (DM) Sanjeev Kumar said six new traffic check posts have been set up to avoid snarls on   bridge. “From now on, Ara-bound vehicles from Patna will use Dhandiha-Chandi-Sakkadi route instead of   route. On the other hand, Chhapra-bound vehicles from Ara will ply via Koelwar police station Mor. All SDOs have been asked to identify the accident-prone areas and initiate measures to prevent accidents,” the DM said.
 
 Residents are fed up with traffic jams at all major thoroughfares of the town. “It takes more than an hour, instead of usual five minutes, to reach Bichli Road from Gopali Chowk road traffic snarls at Dharman Chowk and Chitratoli Road,” said Gappu Mishra, a bookseller.
 
 Social activist Raj Kishore Sharma said, “Be it office-goers, students or patients, everyone is facing immense trouble due to traffic jam in the town. Anti-encroachment drives should be initiated to free the footpath from encroachers. A vendor zone should also be made where vendors can sell their articles without causing hindrance to the traffic.”
 
 Sharma said the administration should earmark a specific place for parking of auto- rickshaws and divert school buses to different routes, especially during peak hours.
