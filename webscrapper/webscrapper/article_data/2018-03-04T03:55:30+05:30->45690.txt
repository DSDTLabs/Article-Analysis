MUMBAI: The BMC general body on Saturday cleared a proposal for hike in bus fares. The hike, which will be Rs 1 to Rs 12 for distances over 4 km, could come into effect latest by April 1. 

  
  
 
 “The hike will need a final nod from the  . If it is granted soon, the hike could come into effect in a few days,” said an official. 
 
 No hike has been proposed for shorter distances—0-2 km and 2-4 km. The student monthly bus pass has been hiked by Rs 50. There will also be a hike in daily bus pass from Rs 70 to Rs 90. For the separate bus passes (island city and suburbs), the hike will be Rs 10. The AC bus fare too has been hiked by Rs 5. Though AC buses were taken off roads last year, the fare hike will be for AC hybrid buses and mini AC buses that are arriving soon.
 
 The proposal which was cleared under ‘urgent business’ by the civic house also talks of a slew of reforms for BEST suggested by BMC. The proposal aims to ensure rationalisation of bus routes, scrapping of routes with less than 40% occupancy, rationalisation of fleet. 
 
 Leader of the House Yashwant Jadhav said, “The BEST budget is yet to be cleared by the general body, and this is a separate proposal of reforms. It would have lapsed by March 7, which is why we took it up under urgent business.” Leader of the opposition Ravi Raja from Congress opposed the revision, saying that Mumbaikars should not be burdened with a hike. 
 
 The BEST budget for 2018-19 showed a deficit of Rs 880 crore. After implementing the reforms, the deficit may come down to Rs 377 crore. The BEST has sought Rs 377 crore from BMC to show a surplus budget of Rs 1 lakh for the next year.
 
 A BEST panel member said, “The administration should have first cut down costs of operations and reduced staff allowances before hiking fares.”
