Panaji: The state government will file its reply by Thursday in the high court of Bombay at Goa, in the matter filed by the around 125 medical seat aspirants, who missed the deadline to apply for the seats.  During the hearing on July 17, the state had asked the court for time to file its reply.  In the meantime, around 10 students, from the 125 who had approached the court, have secured a MBBS seat as per the provisional admissions. These admissions stand until further orders of the court. Implementing the interim order of the high court of Bombay at Goa, the directorate of technical education (DTE), on last Monday, filled the MBBS programme seats as per the provisional merit list of students it had prepared. Around 125 students had approached the court for relief after they missed the DTE’s deadline to apply for the MBBS seats.  In an interim order issued in the case on July 10, the high court had asked the DTE to include the 125 late applicant students in the provisional merit list it was preparing for the MBBS seats.  During the case’s hearing last week, the high court asked DTE to give provisional admissions to students to the MBBS programme based on this merit list, which brought temporary relief to the 125 students. These provisional admissions, however, are subject to further orders of the court. Last week, the DTE filled the professsional degree seats in Goa for all the programmes for which entry is based on the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET).  Provisional admissions were carried out for the programmes of medicine, dentistry, homeopathy and ayurveda in Goa.  Around 2,000 students applied for these four programmes this year. A large chunk of these 2,000 were aspirants for the medical seat. Goa has only 128 seats in medicine on offer at the Goa Medical College for MBBS programme. Last week, the DTE filled the professional degree seats in Goa for all the programmes for which entry is based on the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET)
