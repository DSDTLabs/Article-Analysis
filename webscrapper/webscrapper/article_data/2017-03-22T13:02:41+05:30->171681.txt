NASHIK: The traffic police department — looking to fix the   for vehicles on flyovers passing through the city on the   — has sought objections or suggestions from residents.

 The citizens were asked to submit their objections/suggestions to the city traffic branch office along   or email it to city_traffic@nashikpolice.com by Thursday.
 
 The decision to fix the limit on the elevated structures came after a driver and a cleaner of a speeding truck were killed when the former ended up ramming his vehicle into a stationary truck on a   on March 11.
 
 According to sources in the police department, the   limit is going to be set at 50km/hour. Officials said accidents occurred on the flyover and other elevated structures mainly due to over-speeding.
 
 Senior police officials said that due to some technical snags, motorists halt their vehicles on the flyover for getting it repaired. However, motorists who are speeding over 100 km/hr find it difficult to control their vehicle after seeing a stationary vehicle in the middle of the road.
 
 Jayant Bajbale, ACP city traffic branch, said they have got speed guns with the help of which traffic cops can spot speeding motorists on the elevated corridors. “The speeding motorists will be intercepted by other traffic cops waiting on the other end of the flyover and necessary action will be taken against them,” he said.
 
 The official said they have also been taking action against motorists who are seen halting their vehicles on the elevated structure either to drop or pick passengers waiting for private buses.
