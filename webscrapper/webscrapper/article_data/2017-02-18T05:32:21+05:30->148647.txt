 End of an ordeal for Tvm woman
 
 Smitha Edison, a native of Vettukadu in Thiruvananthapuram, who had been facing harassment from her sponsor and family, flew back to India after the intervention of the volunteers of Kairali, a forum for Ma layali community. Smitha reached Najran in Saudi Arabia to work as house maid 10 months ago. She did not get the salary promised by the agent and was made to work at houses in Najran and Sharoura of the same sponsor. The sponsor and his family members used to harass her. When she informed Kairali workers about her bitter experiences, they suggested her to escape from the house and surrender at the nearby police station. Later, her sponsor declared her runaway (huroub), however, police summoned the sponsor and asked him to remove her huroub status which he refused and demanded compensation for doing the same. He said he had invested huge amount to bring her from India. After negotiations with Kairali leaders, he agreed to give her final exit visa stamped on receipt of SR1,500. A travel agent in Najran offered her return ticket. Kairali volunteers accompanied her till Abha airport from where she flew back to Trivandrum.
