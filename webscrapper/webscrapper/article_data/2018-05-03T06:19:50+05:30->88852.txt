MUMBAI: High-ranking bureaucrats Medha Gadgil and Sudhir Shrivastava have proceeded on   to protest against the   of a junior, D K Jain, as  . It was for the first time in recent history that a section of bureaucrats proceeded on leave. 

 TOI had on Wednesday reported that two superseded officials might go on leave over the chief secretary’s appointment.
 
 A senior bureaucrat confirmed to TOI that Shrivastava, who was on leave for two days, has extended his leave, while Gadgil has proceeded on a month’s leave. “It’s a routine application for leave, it does not mean that they are proceeding on leave to protest against the appointment of Jain,” he said.
 
 Gadgil, Shrivastava and Jain belong to the 1983 batch of the IAS, but Gadgil is senior to all of them. Shrivastava is next and then it is Jain. Gadgil is due for retirement in August 2019 and Shrivastava in October 2018, while Jain will retire in January 2019.
 
 A month ago, when there were discussions on appointing a chief secretary to succeed Sumit Mullick, Gadgil was expecting to be appointed the next chief secretary in view of her seniority. In the recent past she even made an attempt to present her case before chief minister Devendra Fadnavis but did not succeed. 
 
 Shrivastava also met the chief minster but did not succeed in making his case. According to reports, Fadnavis expressed his inability to consider him for the post of chief secretary. He was offered the post of chairman of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board with a tenure of five years. Shrivastava rejected the proposal and when Jain’s order was issued, he quietly proceeded on leave.
 
 The bureaucrat who spoke to TOI made it clear that there is no principle or rule for the appointment of chief secretary on the basis of seniority; it is the prerogative of the chief minister. In the past, on several occasions, junior bureaucrats have superseded seniors, but no one lodged a protest or proceeded on leave.
