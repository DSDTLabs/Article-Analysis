HYDERABAD:  's ( ) city wing will stage a protest on May 29 in front of   office against corruption in the civic body. 

 BJP's Hyderabad unit president   told TOI: "Corruption has increased multi fold in Telangana, particularly in GHMC. The recent CMS-India Corruption study 2018 revealed that   is second most poor performing state in fighting corruption, particularly in public services." 
 
 "There is a nexus of contractor-official and corporators in GHMC limits. Ruling party corporators are minting money. City lakes are being encroached because of which during rainy season, nalas and tanks will overflow and inundate colonies, but GHMC has turned a blind eye. 
 
 There is no preparation to fight the fallout of monsoon season. The town planning department is corrupt and building permissions cannot be obtained without bribe," Rao added.
