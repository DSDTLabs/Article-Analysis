BARNALA: Angry over the poor condition of roads in Barnala, residents of the town on Saturday put up flex boards along Dhanaula road asking the municipal council to improve the condition of roads. Residents of Dhanaula have been sitting on a protest for the past several days demanding repair of the roads that are full of potholes.

 They complained that the condition of roads in the grain market and Khuddi areas was equally bad. “We have been protesting for over a month now, demanding for repair of roads, which can actually be hardly termed so. Bumpy rides have become a nightmare for those living in Dhanaula side. Now, we have decided to intensify the protest and question officials of municipal council and leaders of political parties,” said  , a resident of Dhanaula road.
 
 Navkiran Singh, a resident on Patti road, said “The municipal council authorities are spending money in relaying already well laid-up streets but not even a penny is being spent to construct and repair the roads, which are in dire need of it.”
 
 Claiming that repair work on various roads would be started soon, Barnala municipal council executive officer (EO)   said, “Tender for Dhanaula road for Rs 3.5 crore has been approved and construction work for the same will be started in a week.”
