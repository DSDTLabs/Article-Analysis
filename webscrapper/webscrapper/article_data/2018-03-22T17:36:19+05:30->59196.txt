MUMBAI: For the first time since the IPL’s inception a decade back, the captains of six IPL teams will miss the opening ceremony of the cash-rich Twenty20 tournament due to logistical reasons.

 
 TOI has learnt that the opening ceremony, scheduled for April 7 here at the Wankhede Stadium, will be missed by   (RCB), Steve Smith (RR),   (DD), R Ashwin (KXIP), Dinesh Karthik (KKR) and David Warner (SRH).   (CSK) and   (MI), though, will be present for it as their teams clash with each other at the Wankhede later that day.
 
 “We’ve done away with holding the opening ceremony a day in advance. Four teams play their matches on April 8 (Kings XI Punjab play the Delhi Daredevils in Mohali at 4pm, while the Kolkata Knight Riders take on   at 8pm). The game in Mohali was supposed to have taken place in Delhi earlier, before the schedule was changed. It’s a 4pm game, and we can’t expect the captains of those teams to fly in the evening to Delhi and undertake a road trip in the night, or on the morning of the match,” a source in the Board told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 All the eight team skippers, though, are set to visit the city for the pre-IPL meeting of captains on April 6. On that day, the BCCI will record the ‘Spirit of Cricket’ pledge from the skippers, undertaken every year, and play it out in the opening ceremony the next day.
