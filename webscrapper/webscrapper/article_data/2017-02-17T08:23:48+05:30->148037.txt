CHARMINAR: The   is being cautious with the case of preacher Aijazuddin Mohiuddin   who was `temporarily suspended' from the post of president of an important masjid in Humayun Nagar.

 It was on January 27 that the preacher delivered a Friday sermon before the congregational prayers at   which a certain section of the community objected to even as it described it as `misleading'. Acting on complaints, the board decided to suspend the preacher. A case against the preacher was booked as well.
