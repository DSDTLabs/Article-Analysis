While protests by students are an issue of concern for the police, the other major issue is children in conflict with the law. The deputy inspector general of police (DIG) for   range and Tirunelveli city police commissioner   told TOI that more than 100 cases have been registered against students in the three districts in the region from January to May this year.

 Some of these cases have more than one minor or student as the accused. Most of the cases are pertaining to clashes between students in schools and colleges. "These small clashes are taken outside the institution and they fight in places such as bus stands and involves adults too," he said. Some of these clashes have the caste factor as a reason. The behaviour of students is said to be influenced by their elders.
 
 Clashes on the campuses have come down as schools are closed for summer holidays. With schools to reopen in about 10 days, the police have made an appeal to the parents and teachers to also have a watch on the behaviour of students and not neglect even if a minor clash arose among them. On the other hand, some students have also been booked for committing grave crimes such as rapes and murders.
