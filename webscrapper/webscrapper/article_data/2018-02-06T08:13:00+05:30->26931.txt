HYDERABAD: An RTI reply from the Telangana state forest department (TSFD) has revealed that 51wildlife poaching cases were registered in 2017, but none from wetlands. In a matter of concern, the government hasn’t notified any wetland authority in Telangana.

 The highest number of wildlife offences were reported from  , with around 16 cases booked. Wetlands like Pakhal, Manjeera, Kinnersani, Pocharam mainly fall under Warangal, Medak and   districts. There were a negligible number of wildlife offences recorded in 2017 in these areas as per the RTI reply.
 
 The Union ministry of environment and forest notified Wetlands Conservation and Management Rules, 2017, on September 26, 2017. Rules stated that state governments should constitute State Wetlands Authority within three months of the notification, comprising officials from various departments under the chairmanship of the state forest minister.
 
 Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden Dr Manoranjan Bhanja in the RTI reply to wildlife activist   said, “TSFD is managing nine wildlife sanctuaries and three national parks with the protection of flora and fauna as top priority. Sanctuaries like Manjeera, Pakhal, Kinnersani and Pocharam are rich in bird life, and they are all well protected. Apart from forest beat officers, mobile parties, strike force anti-poaching squads are deployed for regular patrolling for checking wildlife offences.”
 
 Mujtaba Hasan Askari said, “Most of the 51cases booked are against local poachers who use traditional ways of poaching like using traps, snarls etc. The big fish who poach with sophisticated rifles and double barrel guns go scot free.” He said there are at least 150 wetlands in the state. “There is rampant poaching in the lakes and wetlands, and the surveillance mechanism as stated in the RTI reply by a single forest beat officer is grossly inadequate,” he said.
