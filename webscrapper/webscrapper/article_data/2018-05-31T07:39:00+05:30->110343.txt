Sangrur: A month after cops raided Sangrur jail on April 28, seven teams led by deputy commission Ghanshyam Thori on Wednesday carried out another search of the barracks of the district prison and found a SIM card shell and a mobile charging cable.

 Thori said they had received specific instructions from the additional chief secretary (prisons) to carry out a search within the jail in view of reports of mobile phones being used from inside the prisons across the state. He added that during the raid that continued for over two hours, teams comprising of 70 civil and police officials checked all barracks to ensure no banned substances were being used inside the walled premises. 
 
 During the raid, the deputy commissioner also interacted with the prisoners and reviewed available facilities. He later instructed the jail superintendent to regularly monitor prison cells so that no phones or banned substances could be sneaked inside the jail.
 
 Thori said some of the prisoners brought to his notice that their pending cases in the court were progressing at a slow pace and the administration had decided to bring the matter to the notice of district and sessions Judge.
 
 Earlier, in April Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had ordered search of the Sangrur jail on after a post updated on a social media account in the name of gangster Ravi Deol, who is lodged inside the jail, went viral. However, it was later found that as many as five different accounts were being operated in the name of Deol and video had been uploaded from outside the jail.
