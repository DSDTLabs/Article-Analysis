LUDHIANA: A one-and-a-half-year-old boy died after falling in an open drain on   road, Khanna, on Thursday. The toddler was playing outside the house when the incident happened. 

 Other children raised the alarm after which the family and neighbours rushed to the spot. But by the time family pulled him out of the drain, the child had died.
 
 The child was identified as Ritesh Kumar of Dashmesh Nagar, Lalheri road near railway crossing, Khanna. 
 
 His mother Aarti Devi said all neighbours were chatting while children were playing outside the house. She did not notice when her son went near the drain and fell into it. When other children raised the alarm, we all rushed to the spot and pulled him out, but he had died by then.
 
 Child's father  , a migrant labourer, said during election, the municipal council had failed to even cover the drain. "I hold the municipal council responsible for the death of my son," he added.
 
 Khanna municipal council president Vikas Mehta said, "I am aware of the problem of open drains in the area. The council will float the tender to start sewerage work today itself. Besides, the council will also come up with a solution on open drains till the sewerage work is carried out completely."
