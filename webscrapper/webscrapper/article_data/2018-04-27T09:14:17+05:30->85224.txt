VISAKHAPATNAM: Students from   without a regular 10 plus 2 degree and opting to study law are not eligible to take up three-year LLB course even if they clear the entrance exams. This has led to resentment in students in the state who have approached the   (BCI) for changing the norms but there has not been any development yet.

 Hundreds of students graduate from open universities and AU School of Distance Education every year who lack regular intermediate degrees. Some of them who hope to pursue LLB, appear and often qualify in law entrance tests. But they find the doors to law colleges closed because they do not have valid intermediate degrees.
 
 R Vani from Tagarapuvalasa said, “I dropped out of school owing to financial constraints. After that I got married. Years later, I decided to pursue my studies again and at 29 years of age I did my graduation from AU School of Distance Education. I had some problems in my marital life and decided to study law to fight my own case. It is then that I realised that as per AP Law common entrance test ( ) notification, only those who have valid 10 plus 2 degrees from recognized institutes are eligible to study LLB.”
 
 Like Vani, many other students interested in pursuing LLB could not take up a career in law and have approached the BCI to relax the rule of mandatory 10 plus 2 degree from regular colleges.
 
 Senior advocate and president of Forum of Legal Professionals (FLP) said, “The   has directed that promotion of legal education is a must. In order to encourage legal education, the Supreme Court had stayed a BCI resolution a few months ago that barred pursuing legal practice after 45 years of age. This shows that the apex court wants people to take up law and be legally educated. Therefore, the BCI, which oversees the law colleges and curriculum in the country, should relax the rules and allow students from open universities to appear for law entrance tests and study LLB.”
