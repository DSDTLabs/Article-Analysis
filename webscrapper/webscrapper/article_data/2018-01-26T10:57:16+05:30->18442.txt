Not just a solution to traffic congestion, the relocation of the cramped   would help the civic body implement the   project at ease. Locations such as Amma Mandapam, Rockfort and Gandhi Market come within the 7sqkm area of the Area Based Development (ABD) project under smart city mission. The civic body will have a tough time in making the market vicinity smart and clean, unless and until a portion, perhaps the entire Gandhi Market, is relocated.

 As   on June 2017 bagged a spot in the list of the 30 smart cities across the nation selected by the   (MoHUA), Trichy will be getting a fund of at least Rs1,000 crore for development works in the next five years. As Gandhi Market come in one of the locations where the project is supposed to be implemented, the traffic congestion and hygiene issues will become uphill tasks for the civic body to implement the smart city mission. "Shifting even a portion of Gandhi Market would be highly helpful for us to free the congested space. Even if some of the traders move out of the Gandhi Market, the amount of waste generated would come down," an official source with the civic body said.
