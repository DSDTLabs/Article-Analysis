NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court’s decision on Friday to increase Karnataka’s   water allocation was meant to quench the thirst of 13 million residents of Bengaluru, whose share alone added 4.75 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) to the state’s kitty.

 Of the total increased allocation of 14.75 tmcft of Cauvery water to  , other 10 tmcft was given to the state to offset the 10 tmcft of water its neighbour Tamil Nadu drew from groundwater resources in Cauvery basin.
 
  
  
 
 A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra junked the approach of   (CWDT) to reduce the demand of Karnataka for Bengaluru. 
 
 The tribunal had justified minimal allocation of Cauvery water to Bengaluru saying only one-third of the I-T city fell within the river’s basin. 
 
 Karnataka’s urban development department projects the city’s population to be in the vicinity of 20.3 million by 2031 and had demanded 30-tmcft for drinking purposes.
