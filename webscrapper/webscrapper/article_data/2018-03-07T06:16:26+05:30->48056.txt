 IRP Subodh Kumar Agarwal on March 1 issued a notice calling for claims of creditors before March 14, 2018. Interestingly, Punjab National Bank too is among the lenders to the hotel group, promoted by the Oberois. The   share was Rs118 crore, and apart from PNB and BOB, six other banks had given loans to the group.
 
 A source at Trident Hotel told TOI: “Particularly after Ivanka’s visit and stay, the occupancy ratio has gone up. And the demand is particularly for the suite in which she stayed.” Ivanka was in Hyderabad on November 28-29 last year for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.
