LUCKNOW: With   causing too many bottlenecks, traffic police has instructed   ( ) to widen Faizabad Road up to 1-2 metres on the sides around the crossing to make way for traffic. 

 City bus stoppage point at the crossing will also be shifted to some other place on this stretch. ASP (Traffic) Ravi Shankar Nim said, “Where we shift the bus stop depends on the survey of passenger footfall at various points on the route.” Also, the tempo stand which was located at the main crossing will also be relocated. 
 
 All these arrangements have to be made over the weekend as traffic police and LMRC will jointly begin the final survey, with the above modifications, from Monday. Nim said they were still scouting for an ideal location for the bus stop on this route. If that doesn’t happen, buses will be allowed to halt for a few seconds to pick and drop passengers. 
 
 The state government held a closed door meeting with various departments on Friday to address the problem of congestion on many spots along the Metro construction routes. The focus was on crossings of Polytechnic, Kamta, IT and Badshahnagar. 
 
 Meanwhile, LMC has also been asked to chip in to remove encroachments on the road between Kukrail Nullah and the crossing and also under the flyover by July 25. LMRC has been asked to put signage at diversion points and also relocate electricity poles and a police outpost coming in the way of traffic movement. LMRC spokesperson confirmed they had held a meeting with traffic police on Saturday and that the corporation would follow the instructions to help ease traffic around the diversion.
