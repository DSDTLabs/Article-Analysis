NEW DELHI: The   has given a six-month window as a onetime opportunity to green violators for getting   for their projects which have been running without obtaining the required permission.

 The opportunity is available only to those activities which come under permissible categories. 
 
 The ministry will order closure of those which donâ€™t fall under these categories. Even during this window, the units will be required to pay heavy penalty as remediation for damage caused to environment due to violation of laws. 
 
 The project proponents will have to submit a bank guarantee equivalent to the amount of remediation plan. The idea of imposing heavy penalty is to take away the economic benefits, if any, derived by the unit due to the violation of rules.
 
 A notification to this effect was issued by the ministry on March 14. 
 
 The ministry has argued that the decision to give such an opportunity to violators is taken to bring such projects and activities in compliance with the   rather than leaving them unregulated and unchecked. 
 
 The ministry has regularly been receiving a number of applications from such projects which have either started the work on site, expanded the production beyond the limit of environmental clearance or changed the product mix without obtaining prior clearance.
 
 According to the notification, all cases of violation, irrespective of category, will be appraised by the   ( ) at the central level. 
 
 It means cases of violation can only be appraised at the level of the environment ministry and there will be no role of state-level panels.
 
 The EAC will first examine whether the project is permissible at the site where it has come up. If not, the committee will recommend its closure.
