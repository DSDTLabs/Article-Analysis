MAPUSA: Comparing the   government in the state to a headless chicken, Thivim MLA   has accused it of not being serious about finding a solution to the mining issue as well as several other issues plaguing the state, this despite the BJP government being in power both in the state as well as at the Centre. 

 Halarnkar was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the hot mixing work of roads in his constituency. The works have been undertaken at an estimated cost of around Rs 5.2 lakh. He also accused the BJP government for delaying the implementation of several developmental works in the state.
 
 “I don’t understand the direction this government is heading in. It has taken the state to a pathetic condition. There is insufficient money to undertake even sustainable development,” he said.
 
 “Today all major industries such as tourism and mining have come to a halt. Even bars have been shut down. People are starving,” the   said.
