DEHRADUN: A 32-year-old woman died after she jumped from the third floor of CMI hospital on Thursday. Police said that the woman,  , could have been depressed as she had no children and had been undergoing treatment at the hospital for past two years.
 
  Dr Mahesh Kuriyal, managing director, CMI, said, “CCTV footage shows that the woman entered hospital at 11am on Thursday. She was alone and did not visit any doctor. She went to the third floor where we have operation theatres. A guard who was on duty asked her to go inside and sit in the shade but she pretended that she was talking on phone. Within seconds, she jumped off the building.”

  Senior gynaecologist Dr Sumita Prabhakar said that the patient had seemed normal. “She had not shown any sign that she was considering such an extreme step. It is shocking.”
