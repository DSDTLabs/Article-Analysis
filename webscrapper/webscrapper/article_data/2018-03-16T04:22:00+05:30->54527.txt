Vadodara: The Sanjeli police station in Dahod registered an offence regarding the leak of class X science and technology question paper of Gujarat board on Wednesday. Dahod district education officer (DEO) registered the offence following instructions from the top brass of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB).  The offence was registered under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, Gujarat Secondary Education Act and for violation of a notification by the district collector. The offence has been registered against unidentified persons who allegedly clicked pictures of the question paper and circulated it on Whatsapp. Sanjeli police sub-inspector S M Bariya said they have sought details of phone numbers of officials and other personnel involved in the exam process.  These include those working at exam centres in Sanjeli, those involved with the transportation of question papers as well as those despatching them. The police has also sought details of a case registered regarding a similar leak in Mahisagar district last year. While the leak had come to light in Mahisagar, it was later ascertained that the paper was leaked from Dahod and had reached Mahisagar only later. The present incident has uncanny similarities with last year’s case. Police sources said that apart from gathering details of phones of persons involved in the exam process, they had started working backwards to trace where the message with the pictures of the question paper had originated. “It is a time consuming process,” said an official.
