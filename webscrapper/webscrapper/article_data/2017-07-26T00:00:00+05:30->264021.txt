Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington’s death is being mourned across the world and people are coming out, paying their tributes in different ways, including   from Bengaluru-based Kalakarah, who have painted a picture of him in Kormangala, near Jyoti Nivas College. Over three days (early morning and late evening hours), three artists painted a picture of Chester, with ‘Numb’ being the inspiration and the theme for the street  .

 Vishnu Ambat, artist, who worked on the painting, says, “Everybody in Bengaluru, especially people from the 90s, have grown up listening to Linkin Park and Numb in particular. We chose this song because it has had a huge influence on us as well as several people in the city; they can relate to our painting. The city has a vibrant rock culture and we thought it was best to pay our tributes to Chester through this.”
 
 The art work is a mix of spray painting and painting with brush. “We chose to use pop art, as it makes the painting stand out. It is a mix of pop art using straight lines. Chester’s face is completely hand painted, whereas the rest is done using spray paints,” says Vishnu adding that there were people who helped them clean the area before they began working on the art work.
