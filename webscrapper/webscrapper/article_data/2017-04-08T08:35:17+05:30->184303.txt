SURAT: A 55-year-old   owner   was stabbed to death near Gotalawadi in Katargam on Friday morning at 11.30 am. He was allegedly killed by bootleggers as they suspected that the deceased had informed the police about their business.

 Police said that two persons on a motorcycle intercepted Kathiriya, who was driving a car, near   in Katargam. The duo pulled Kathiriya out of the car and allegedly stabbed him repeatedly with a sword before fleeing from the spot. He was stabbed 10 times in chest, legs and thighs. Kathiriya was rushed to SMIMER hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. 
 
 According to police, Kathiriya owned a textile unit which he had given on lease since 2010. The rent from the unit was his only source of income. His elder brother Vasant Kathiriya, lived in Kodra Maholla of Rampura in their ancestral house. 
 
 Police said, Kathiriya used to visit their ancestral house often where he came in touch with   and Vijay Mangrolia, who are alleged to be bootleggers. According to Kathiriyaâ€™s son Dharmesh, about a fortnight ago, Hemant and Vijay created a ruckus at 2 am in the night and threatened to kill anyone who gave information to police about them.
 
 Dharmesh in his complaint alleged that the bootlegger duo thought his father had informed police about them so they killed him.
