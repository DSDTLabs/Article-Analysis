COLOMBO: The father of Sri Lankan cricket allrounder   was shot dead by unidentified gunmen on the eve of the national team's departure to the West Indies on Friday, police said.

 
 The player's father Ranjan, a local politician, was gunned down in  , a suburb of the capital  , close to midnight on Thursday, police said. An investigation is underway but no arrests have been made.
 
 Cricket officials said 26-year-old de Silva withdrew from the tour that involves three Test matches. 
 
 Sri Lanka's cricket board will not replace allrounder Dhananjaya de Silva who withdrew from a tour of the West Indies following the murder of his father, officials said Friday.
 
 "There will be no replacement for Dhananjaya," a board official told AFP. "Instead of a 17-member squad, we will now have 16."
 
 Sri Lanka Cricket said it will support the 26-year-old Dhananjaya "at this time of sorrow and grief".
 
 Police said an investigation was underway but no arrests had been made.
 
 Sri Lanka will also miss opener   who fractured a finger while batting in the nets this month as he prepared for a domestic tournament.
