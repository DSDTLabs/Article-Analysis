NASHIK: Former chief minister and   state president   on Sunday appealed to voters to not let any political person enter their houses with money on the eve of polling day.

 “People from various political parties will visit you and offer cash. Don’t open the doors to them. Vote responsibly in favour of the Congress-NCP candidates,” he said while addressing the only Congress   in poll-bound Nashik.
 
 Chavan’s rally was scheduled at 2.30pm but began one-and-a-half-hour late because of low turn-out. Congress workers and local leaders were continuously appealing to the residents to join the rally. The response was poor even after the former CM reached the venue.
 
 “The BJP and the   are in a nexus and have started a business to fool you. They pretend to fight against each other and grab votes. This is the new tactic of these parties that believe in dividing people on the lines of religion and caste,” said Chavan.
 
 He took a dig at chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for lowering the dignity of the CM’s post. 
 
 “No one believes in the CM’s words these days. His immature statements, foolish claims and fake promises have tarnished the chief minister’s post,” he said.
 
 Chavan claimed that all the works that parties such as the BJP and the MNS are boasting of in Nashik were planned and executed during his time. 
 
 “The Congress and the NCP had strengthened the foundation of Nashik during the 10 years the parties were in power. We allotted a major share of Kumbh Mela allocations in 2013. However, all our projects are being hijacked by the BJP and the MNS,” Chavan said.
 
 MLC Sudhir Tambe, who recently won the graduate constituency polls, was also present at the rally. Former mayor Shobha Bachchav and Congress-NCP candidates from several wards attended Chavan’s rally.
 
 During his speech, Tambe raised the demonetisation issue and appealed to the people not to forgive the BJP for making them stand in queues for months together.
