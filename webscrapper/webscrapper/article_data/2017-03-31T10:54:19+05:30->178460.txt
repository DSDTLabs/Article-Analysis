 For Mukhopadhyay, it will be going back to Tata Sons. He had moved to TCS in January 2008. While with Tata Sons, Mukhopadhyay was involved in TCS’ initial public offering in 2004. More recently, Mukhopadhyay has been helping Tata Sons in its fight against Mistry, which currently is played out in the courts.
 
 Tata Sons is the promoter of the $104-billion   which includes 29 publicly listed companies. It earns its revenues mainly through dividends and royalty fees.
