MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: A draft on   issued by the Centre on Wednesday has proposed a   of the   along the   within which construction is regulated. If implemented, the easing of norms will have immense implications for Greater Mumbai.

 The notification from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change suggests reducing the coastal regulation zone (CRZ)—an area measured from the high tide line on the landward side—to 50 metres from the existing 100. In case of regions close to a bay or creek, the protection may apply to a much narrower slice of land.
 
 
 The draft, if approved, will enable constructions closer to coastlines. However, within the CRZ, more classifications have been introduced to delineate environmentally sensitive areas such as reefs, mangroves and nesting sites.
 
 The coast near Backbay, Marine Drive, Girgaum and Shivaji Park have been officially declared as “bay’’ areas in anticipation of the relaxed rules.
 
 Developers with plots in the Andheri-Oshiwara belt and those in   in the eastern suburbs too will benefit.
