Mumbai:   major   is set to acquire Indian denim and casual wear brand   in a deal estimated at slightly over Rs 500 crore, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. ChrysCapital is in exclusive discussions with  , the owner of Mufti, and is completing due diligence ahead of signing a definitive buyout deal.

 Mufti founder Kamal Khushlani holds a 65% stake in the parent company, leaving rest with a set of investors, mostly high net worth investors. Khushlani, along with some of the investors, is selling stakes in the company that will give ChrysCapital a controlling stake. The deal is estimated to value the company at about Rs 750 crore. JM Financial is advising on the transaction process. ChrysCapital declined to comment. Khushlani didn’t respond to TOI’s call and text message.
 
 Khushlani founded Mufti in 1998 and it emerged popular in the following decade as several Bollywood stars were seen wearing the brand. Mufti has had an indifferent last few years stint due to lack of adequate brand support.
 
 ChrysCapital, the largest India-focused private equity investor, sees scope in strengthening the home-grown brand which fits with the country’s young consumers, who seek to blend western fashion with the Indian spirit. “The brand has strong latent equity, and fresh investments will scale it up,” said a source cited earlier in the report.
 
 Mufti, with the tag line “Nothing Official About It” retails through more than 1,400 multi brand outlets and 120 large format stores. At its peak of expansion, the brand had more than 250 exclusive stores.
