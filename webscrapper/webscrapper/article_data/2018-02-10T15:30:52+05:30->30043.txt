The latest pop-star to debut the Billboard 200 charts is the Cuban sensation  . The 20-year-old pop star cut her teeth in the music scene with the girl band Fifth Harmony and has now come out with her album that already hit the big time with the single ' ' becoming a chart topper. Even though it has been replaced by 'God’s Plan' by Drake, it still continues comfortably on the number fourth spot. If you’ve been anywhere near a club in the past few weeks, there are chances you have heard Havana; the seductive dance number by Camila. With a very Cuban-meets Doo-wop vibe, the number featuring Young Thug is a delightful mix of old school beats meets slick-rap. What stands out in self-titled album is the fact that Camila has chosen to sing lighter, acoustic numbers instead of going for elaborate club numbers. A risky move, it has worked for the pop singer because that gives her an added advantage of debuting with a style of her own. This style is very evident in the tracks 'Never be the Same' and 'All These Years'. While lyrically, the two songs are no masterpieces, the treatment and production makes them stand apart. On 'She Loves Control', a song with a lot of repeat value, Camila has something special with top-notch production by Skrillex. Another very special song is ' '; a lazy acoustic number with some semblance of clever song writing. The same goes with ' ', a song that eerily reminds one of the early Lorde, in the early, 'The Love Club' EP days.

 With her eponymous album, Camilla is surely one singer to watch out for. Also, one thing is clear that the trend of Latin, exotic music will continue to reign for the most of this year as well.
