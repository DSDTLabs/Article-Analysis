Chandigarh: The 10-year-old rape survivor who is 32 weeks pregnant has been found to be mentally strong and has been tolerating all the hardships, said the medical report of a team of PGI doctors after evaluating her physical and mental health. 

 The report was submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday, which on its basis dismissed her plea for abortion. 
 
 “A medical examination of the girl was conducted on July 26. She has been disturbed by the unfortunate incident. But she has been putting on a brave face. With a sound mental and physical health, it was inferred that she can undergo normal delivery rather than abortion,” said a PGI doctor
