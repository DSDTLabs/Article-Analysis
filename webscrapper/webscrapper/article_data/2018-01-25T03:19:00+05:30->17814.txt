Amaravati:   floor leader in assembly P Vishnukumar Raju has asked ministers in the state cabinet who defected from the opposition YSR Congress to quit and seek a fresh mandate from the public.

 Interacting with reporters on Wednesday, after an informal meeting with Public Accounts Committee chairman Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, Raju said they did not approve of the defections, and have expressed reservations over defected legislators being made ministers. He said that existing laws will not allow defections, and it was not democratic to include defected MLAs into the cabinet.
 
 Raju said “As there was no such law, and as existing laws do not encourage defections, those who joined TDP after defecting their previous parties, should vacate their seats and go for fresh elections,” he said.
 
 The State Cabinet has YSR Congress legislators N Amarnath Reddy, C Adinarayana Reddy, Ravu Sujaya Krishna Ranga Rao and Bhuma Akhila Priya as Ministers. The Opposition YSR Congress had made several complaints to Assembly Speaker Dr Kodela Siva Prasada Rao to disqualify the  . As the Speaker’s decision was delayed, the YSR Congress had approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Speaker.
