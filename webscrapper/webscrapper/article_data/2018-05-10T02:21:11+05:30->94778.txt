NOIDA: An executive director of a private firm recently filed a complaint at Sector 20 police station, alleging that Rs 66 lakh was deducted from his bank account without his information. The complainant, Sushil Baveja (54), a resident of Sector 26, holds a joint account with his mother Daya Baveja (90) in Bank of India’s Sector 9 branch. He said, the account was earlier in Link Road Gurgaon Branch since 1980 which was mainly used for the pension of Daya Baveja, as her husband had retired as a Major from Indian Army.

 Sushil said that every year, the bank needed her mother’s age certificate to renew the pension scheme. On January 15, 2018, the family transfered the bank branch to Noida, as they were based in the city.
 
 On April 9, 2018, when the family visited the bank for getting the passbook updated, they found all the money was illegally transferred to different accounts without their knowledge.
 
 “We updated the passbook and found there was no money in account. Some fraudulent persons made transactions of Rs 48 lakh through cheques on January 25 and one transaction of Rs 18 lakh was made on January 30.
 
 Sushil then complained to the bank officials and it was found the transactions were made by Amit Kumar and his mother Maya Devi, who hold accounts in Najafgarh branch in Delhi. The management filed a complaint on April 20.
