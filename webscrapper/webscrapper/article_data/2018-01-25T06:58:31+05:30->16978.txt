NEW DELHI: The   of violence was high, but the   around   and the resultant publicity drew   in large numbers to theatres showing the film in the capital on  . They were reassured in part by the heavy police presence at the theatres.

 “People were mindful of the threat from protesters, but the controversy surrounding the movie has also increased curiosity, and I wanted to know what was in the movie that was infuriating people enough to take the law into their own hands,” said Gurgaon resident Rahul Dixit at a cinema hall in Chanakyapuri. Dixit added that he chose to watch the movie there because the probability of fringe groups descending on central Delhi was lesser.
 
 Other viewers reiterated that their interest in Padmaavat had been stoked by the hubbub rather than by any clear information about its storyline. Surender Shokhand came all the way from Jind in Haryana to Connaught Place with 15 friends. “We were unable to watch the movie in Haryana because of the protests. We will see it here and if we find anything objectionable, we will join the protests,” said Shokhand.
 
 Not everyone was out there to find faults. At Vasant Kunj, Shreya Manchanda insisted, “The police should take strict action against groups or people creating a panic when the film certification board and the Supreme Court have given the movie their nod.”
 
 Theatre owners made their own security arrangement in addition to the teams of around 20 policemen at their halls. Delhi Police had also deployed quick reaction teams at malls where multiplexes are located. There were no movie posters at the cinema halls, and displays informing about show timings made no mention of Padmaavat. Counter staff disclosed that most tickets were bought online. Many viewers called in to enquire about disturbances before venturing to the theatres.
