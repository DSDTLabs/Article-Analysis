Local NGOs are all set to make a documentary film on   water contamination to create awareness among people. The NGOs and activists had been collecting water samples and sending them to government laboratories for testing, besides speaking to the people to find out problems they face due to the water contamination.

 “We have video and photographic evidence. We plan to make a documentary film to create awareness among people. We would play the documentary in villages and institutions,” said M Su Mani of Save Bhavani Trust.
 
 They also have plans petition the National Green Tribunal to remove the barrages to allow the free flow of river. Activists of Save Bhavani Trust said they would soon file a case and ensure that the barrages were opened and steps were taken to reduce the water contamination.
 
 “Several companies violate norms. If they discharge only treated water into the river, what’s the source of chemical contamination,” asked Shanthamurthy, legal adviser to the trust.
 
 The members of the trust had been organising trails to the river for the past one year. They had also petitioned various authorities, including the municipality, public works department, Tamil Nadu pollution control board and Tangedco-Erode, but in vain.
 
 “We are hopeful that the National Green Tribunal would initiative action on our complaint. Since this is a major potable water source for over 1.5 lakh residents of Mettupalayam, there is huge risk to the future generations,” Shanthamurthy said.
