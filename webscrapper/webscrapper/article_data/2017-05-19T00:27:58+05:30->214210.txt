MUMBAI: The   service on a 3-km long stretch between   and Matheran may resume in June.   (CR) has carried out a   over the past few weeks to get the system ready for commuters.

 Train services on the entire 20-km long corridor were suspended after twin derailments in May 2016. CR’s divisional manager Ravindra Goyal said, “Work is on in full swing and we plan to run services on the Aman Lodge-Matheran stretch in June.”
 
 CR earlier operated 24 services during the weekend on the  . A senior official said, “To begin with, we plan to run run only four to six services per day and gradually increase them.”
 
 A senior official said, “We are keeping our fingers crossed as there was one derailment last month during the trials. Also, there are apprehensions that ballast (stones) may prove to be inadequate to hold the track firm.” 
 
 In December 2016, the CR administration brought two engines with air brake systems to Neral station. Both the May 2016 derailments were blamed on the manual braking system. The older locomotive operated on 300 Hp, which was not sufficient to operate an air-braking system as its compressor too needs to draw power. CR now has a 600-horsepower locomotive and eight coaches. The official said, “The train will have air-brake systems, eliminating the need for manual brakes.”
 
 The maximum speed allowed for the toy train prior to derailment was 15 kmph. CR may now reduce the maximum speed limit further to 10 kmph.
 
 The decision to suspend the toy train service has hit tourists, locals and hotel operators who would ferry provision via the train in the absence of motorable transport to the tiny hill station. In fact, locals had earlier threatened to stage a rail-roko on the suburban section near Neral if a decision to resume the service was not taken soon.
