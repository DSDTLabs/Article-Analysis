TRICHY: The hard work of volunteers, who rid   of   last week, has gone in vain as political posters have again cropped up on the retaining walls of the bridge. Even though the   has affixed the conventional ‘stick no bills’ sign, political parties and advertisers have taken the warning for granted. 

 The Chettipalam Bridge, built over the Uyyakondan canal, near MGR roundabout is accessed by thousands of vehicles each day. The four lane bridge had been serving as medium for political parties and private advertisers to paste advertisement posters and protest announcements for years now. As the traffic sign, signifying that the bridge ahead is narrower than the approach road, was completely covered by these posters, youth including professionals and college students took up a cleaning drive along the 35 metre long bridge on February 25.
 
 For the last one week Chettipalam Bridge wore a refreshed look, thanks to the hours of cleaning undertaken by the youth. 
 
 “Posters very close to the abstract art displayed by the Trichy Corporation near the Chettipalam Bridge making a comeback, would certainly demotivate youth to keep public places clean. It also signifies that the enforcement is lagging,” S  , resident of   told TOI.
 
 Posters celebrating the birthday of an office bearer with   and a protest announcement from CITU were found along the retaining walls of the bridge. When contacted, a representative of CITU said that their posters declaring a protest announcement would be removed at the earliest.
