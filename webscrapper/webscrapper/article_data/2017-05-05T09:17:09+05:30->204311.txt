CHENNAI: A third round of arguments over the vexed post-graduate   case began before Justice M Sathyanarayanan of  , a day after a   delivered a   on Wednesday. It will continue on Friday, when MCI will make its submissions. 

 The first round was before Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, whose April 17 order held that Tamil Nadu's quota for in service candidates and award of incentive marks to them should be in line with that of the MCI. While Tamil Nadu, since 1992, awards one mark each to all doctors as experience marks, and then one/two mark incentive to those volunteering to work in remote, rural, difficult and hilly areas, MCI regulations have only two classified areas and award 10% of a candidate's NEET-PG marks as incentive per year, subject to maximum of 30%.
 
 The second round was fought before a specially constituted bench of Justice K K Sasidharan and Justice S M Subramanian, which on Wednesday delivered a split verdict, necessitating the third judge, Justice Sathyanarayanan, to hear it.
 
 On Thursday, counsel for the government and individual candidates argued that both Tamil Nadu norms and MCI regulations could co-exist harmoniously since they were not in conflict with each other. 
 
 The state has got power under List III Entry 25 to bring regulations and GO touching upon medical education, and the prospectus is in no way conflict with or in violation of NEET regulations, they argued.
