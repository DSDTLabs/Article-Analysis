PUNE: Bankers in the city who were bracing for   on Monday were surprised to see fewer people at their branches. 

 Considering the long queues at branches on pay-day in December, the bankers were preparing for a similar rush this time around too. However, not many salaried people as well as pensioners visited the banks to withdraw the money.
 
 And there are a multiple reasons for this. Many people are yet to return from vacations (a lot of offices had given an off on Monday too as New Year came on a Sunday) while some have switched to digital payment modes and have already withdrawn enough to suffice for a few days.
 
 The banks expect more rush at branches from January 5 when employers would queue up for withdrawals to pay salaries to their employees. In the   area, where a lot of people work as casual workers or on contract, a sizable section is yet to open bank accounts. 
 
 A majority of the ATMs in the city are still down and out. On January 1, the RBI raised the withdrawal limit from ATMs per card to Rs 4,500 per day from Rs 2,500 earlier. The ATMs, which were working, were giving out Rs 4,500 mostly in the denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500.
 
 “The RBI has told banks’ currency chests to put more money in the ATMs and thereafter take the remaining to branches,” a currency chest officer of a public sector bank said.
 
 However, he said, the cash supply from the RBI is yet to improve and ATM filling is possible only when the RBI provides enough cash to the banks. A majority of the ATMs in   were still “out of cash.”
 
 The branches have seen people bringing back excess cash with them back into circulation – a majority of them in Rs 2,000 denomination. A lot of banks are also expecting that they will benefit when they go to the RBI next time as the   printed “record” currency pieces last year.
