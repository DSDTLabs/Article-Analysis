IMPHAL:   chief minister   on Friday called on the titular king of Manipur,  , at the royal palace here and discussed issues relating to the hills and the valley. 

 Biren told the 'king' that emotional integration of all communities is the need of the hour to make a strong Manipur for which the Meiteis, the majority community of Manipur, have to play the role of a big brother. 
 
 Describing his meeting with the 'king' a 'courtesy call', Biren said, "I went there to pay my respect and urged him to use his position to bridge the gap between the hills and the valley." He promised all help from his government. 
 
 Biren appreciated the role of kings in Manipur who had tied up with the tribal chiefs of various communities since time immemorial. He said, "Today, we are proud of being a Manipuri as no one can suppress us. This is because the kings who ruled Manipur had protected it's territory and bestowed their love and affection on all communities."
 
 He added that every citizen of Manipur should work for the state's integrity.
 
 Biren said Manipur cannot be called a developed state unless both the hills and valley witness development together. He said his government's top priority is overall development of hill areas in the state. "Cabinet meetings will be held in the hill districts and selection of beneficiaries in the hills will be done in the presence of the heads of departments," he added.
 
 The chief minister said the central ministers have agreed to extend financial assistance to the development of hill areas for which the state government is preparing a detailed project for submitting it to the Centre.
 
 Commenting on the encroachment on Indian soil by Myanmarese authorities, the chief minister said he would send a team from the state government to the spot to assess the situation after which a report will be sent to the Centre for further action.
