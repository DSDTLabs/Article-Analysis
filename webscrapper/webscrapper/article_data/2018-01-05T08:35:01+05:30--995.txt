AHMEDABAD: A beautiful person falls in love with a grammarian and says: “I propose!” The grammarian sends back the proposal like a vegetarian banishing the waiter who has brought chicken. “You can propose TO someone, or propose SOMETHING…a plan, a dinner, or marriage,” the grammarian says. “Your sentence makes no sense.” The moral of this uncorroborated, but plausible, story: grammarians write the perfect love letters, but seldom receive any. 

 Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra, the Wren & Martin of Hindustani grammar and   grandees, caution rasikas against being enamoured of such technicalities in music. Indeed, that obsession is just one half-recognized raga away from pretentiousness. And pretentiousness is the Petri dish in which ignorance thrives. “We have no expectations of audiences,” Pandit Rajan Mishra told TOI. “We want them to come with an open mind.” Pandit   said: “Often, people turn up for a concert with preconceived notions. That attitude will not allow them to experience music.”
 
 
  
 Underlying the maestros’ sage words is the spirit that can be found in the opening stanza of Adi Sankara’s “Bhaja Govindam”: at the moment of reckoning, rules of grammar will be of little use. Music, after all, is the vision of the highest form of beauty, a glimpse of emancipation from the drudgery of longings and envy. That sense of liberation, rather than a raga’s name, could be handy when called to reckoning.
 
 Viraj Amar, a disciple of the Mishra brothers, prefers to keep that vision a surprise. “The gurujis often ask what raga I would like to hear, but it would be unfair of me to place a request.” She explained that her gurus gauge the mood of the venue and scan their own inklings to plan their presentation — a few moments before the concert. But those who want to know what the panditjis performed at Saptak on Wednesday, it was Bihag.
