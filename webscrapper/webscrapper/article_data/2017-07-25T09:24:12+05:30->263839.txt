HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Monday asked the government to explain why it has not asked Central agencies-Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau - to probe into the drugs racket in the city. 

 Telangana TDP working president A Revanth Reddy, speaking to reporters at the party headquarters here, said information revealed so far by the state excise department and the government shows that the drugs racket has international links. The excise department might need assistance of central agencies. "Why is the state government not approaching them for help?" Revanth Reddy asked.
 
 He also alleged that several pubs owned by persons related to influential and powerful individuals, who are in the ruling TRS as well as some ministers were being allowed a free run in the city. The government must explain as to why, despite there being a rule that pubs should shut by 11 pm, were being allowed to remain open past midnight, he said. "In fact, some pubs owned by a brother-in-law of an influential person in the government and one owned by a senior minister's son are being allowed to stay open till the wee hours," Revanth Reddy said.
 
 "Is the chief minister not aware of the ownership of these pubs? It is also true that instead of issuing notices to such powerful individuals in the drugs case, the government has been trying to divert attention by calling in people involved in the film industry," he said.
 
 The TDP, he said, would submit a memorandum to the excise department listing out various lacunae in its investigations. "If the department fails to take corrective steps, then we will submit a letter to the governor under provisions of Section 8 of the AP Reorganisation Act. As per this Section, it is the governor's responsibility to protect the prestige of the state. If nothing works, then we will complain directly to the Union home ministry," he said.
