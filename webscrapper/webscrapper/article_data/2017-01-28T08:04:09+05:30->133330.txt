KOCHI: Protesting against what they called an effort by the corporation authorities to sabotage the   campaign launched by the state government, opposition councillors boycotted the meeting of chairpersons of   and working groups convened by mayor   on Friday.
According to the opposition, the mayor convened the meeting so that it would collide with the programme, organized as part of the protection campaign to make government schools centre of excellence.
 
 Opposition councillors alleged that the mayor had been taking out her political vendetta while preparing the schedule of her meeting. “Many of the working group chairpersons and standing committee chairpersons had to attend the programme, organized as part of the campaign, which was held all across the state in the morning,“ said  ,  .
