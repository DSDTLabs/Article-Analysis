KOLKATA: It was around 11.35am when the south-bound train reached Girish Park   station. Suddenly, the power tripped. It was dark inside the compartments and there was panic. Officials rushed in and evacuated the passengers. It was all because the Metro workers were replacing the high speed circuit breakers (HSCBs) . The services finally resumed after a few minutes.

 Services normalized after a few minutes and the empty rake left   at 11.40am. When the rake reached Central, it took commuters and proceeded towards   station as usual.
 
 “For the last seven days, work is on at the Central, Belgachia, Shyambazar, Girish Park, Rabindra Sadan, Jatin Das Park and Mahanayak Uttam Kumar stations to replace the HSCBs. This is part of the Metro’s upgradation plans as new rakes will be introduced. These are special DC circuit breakers that control the flow of power to the third rail. The HSCBs are being replaced after 25 years. Power was drawn from the sub-stations at   and Girish Park. The power tripped due to this,” Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.
 
 According to another official, a circuit breaker is crucial as it stops the flow of power to the third line immediately during an emergency. While trains in the open line draw power from 25,000V cables, only 750V runs through the Metro’s third line.
 
 “There was nothing wrong with the rake from which passengers were evacuated. However, the decision was taken as a precautionary measure,” Banerjee added.
