Liberty Basheer, President of the Film Exhibitor's Federation of Kerala has alleged that   is threatening members of the Federation to join the new association under the latter. Basheer also alleges that theatres under the Federation are being denied new films which are to be released next week, like   and Jomonte Suvisheshangal.

 The Federation had gone on strike earlier, shutting down all the theatres under it, stopping the release of new films and bringing the film industry to a standstill. Dileep and other members of the fraternity had started a new association and several members of the Federation had joined the association. The stand of the new association seems to be that those who went on strike won't be given new films. It is also alleged that those theatres need to clear dues with makers of films which had to be taken off prematurely.
