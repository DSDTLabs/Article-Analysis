GURUGRAM:   across the city have left residents fuming. Outages were reported in  ,  , South City and nearby areas on Thursday and Friday. 

 Residents said the situation was worsening as the frequency of power cuts was increasing by the day.
 
 In Sushant Lok 2, residen ts complained about power fluctuations and outages during the night. Fluctuations were also reported in Sector 22B. Residents of DLF 2 told TOI that they had a sleepless night as they had no power on Thursday. 
 
 “We couldn’t sleep because it was very hot, and our ACs couldn’t work due to the outages,” said Aakanksha Yadav, a resident of DLF 2.
 
  officials, however, said the outages weren’t due to any problems at the feeder level. None of the 509 feeders in New Gurugram tripped on Thursday or Friday, they said. Officials have urged residents to set AC temperatures above 20°C this summer.
 
 “We don’t have control over these kinds of outages. Even after the operationalisation of smart grid, there is no guarantee that such localised cuts will not occur, because they don’t happen from our end,” a senior discom official said.
 
  “A transformer can only withstand demand up to a certain level. Consumers who draw power more than their connected load permits lead transformers to fuse out. Our transformers are already running on 80% of their capacity. Consumers must use set their ACs at temperatures above 20°C. This will result in judicious use of power, and may prevent such outages as well,” the official said.
 
 The discom installed 300 more transformers last winter in a bid to to ensure that the transmission system works at the optimum level and is not driven to its full capacity, exposing it to breakdowns.
