NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court today expressed concern over politicians making allegations against members of the judiciary in media and giving statements to initiate impeachment motion against CJI.

 
 "We all are disturbed by what is happening. It is very unfortunate," a bench comprising Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said referring to media reports making allegations against the judiciary.
 
 On petitioner's request to restrain media from publishing scandalous stories, the apex court said it cannot pass an order without hearing the case and sought the assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal.
 
 The development assumes significance as it comes on a day when the Congress and other opposition parties have decided to submit a notice to initiate impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. The move comes a day after the SC ruling in the CBI Judge B H Loya case.
 
 However, during today's hearing, no reference to CJI was made during brief arguments.
 
 The apex court, while asking the top law officer of the country to assist it in the matter, posted the case for hearing on May 7.
 
 The SC, however, refused to pass any order gagging the media, saying it would not do this without hearing the Attorney General.
