Hyderabad: It’s not just bribery and corruption that is on the rise in  , but   too. A female patient was conned of her 3.5 tola gold chain by a man posing as a doctor at the government-run facility on Friday night.

 Chilkalguda police said the victim, Rama, had been admitted for a gynaecological problem and has been in the hospital for the last few days. On Friday night, a man approached her saying he was the duty doctor and enquired about her health. He told the victim that she needed to be given an injection and asked her to come to the next room.
 
 “When Rama went to the room, the   said the injection had to be given on her neck. He asked her to remove her gold chain and made her keep it on the table nearby. The pseudo doctor actually pricked the victim with the needle, but there was no medicine in the syringe. During this time, he managed to steal the gold chain. The fake doctor then said he would return in a while and vanished,” Chilkalguda sub-inspector Ch Venkatadri said.
 
 It was only after some time passed that the victim realised she had been duped. She dialled 100 and informed the police, who reached Gandhi Hospital to gather more information. They are verifying the CCTV footage from the hospital.
 
 “There is some discrepancy in the narrative of the victim. We are ascertaining the facts,” police said. Cops have registered a case.
