BATHINDA/MANSA: Punjab power minister   has assured farmers that they wouldn’t be charged after electricity meters were installed on their agriculture pumpset connections for the tubewells. While distributing debt relief certificates to farmers at   on Tuesday, Kangar made it clear that the state government was committed to providing free power to the farm sector.

 Kangar said the meters were being installed to assess the transmission and distribution losses so that these could be controlled. “These meters have also been installed in compliance with the orders of Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), which will also assess the free units of power given to the agriculture sector,” he said.
 
 The minister asked the farmers to cooperate with the employees of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) that visit their fields to install meters. Dismissing the claims that meters were meant to send electricity bills to farmers, he said no one would face any problem and they could approach him directly over the issue.
