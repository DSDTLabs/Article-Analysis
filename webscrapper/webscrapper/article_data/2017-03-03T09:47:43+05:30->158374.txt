NEW DELHI: The   ( ) officials -   (joint-secretary),   (treasurer) and CK Khanna (vice-president) - would have to get a clearance from the   (COA) on their roles if after the   clears their qualification.

 Reacting to the letter sent on Wednesday to the COA by the BCCI full members, who contested the role of Vinod Rai and his team vis-a-vis the state associations, a source revealed that the January 30 apex court order says it all. “Vinod Rai shall be the chairman of the COA. The CEO of BCCI shall report to the COA and the administrators shall supervise the management of BCCI,” the order said.
 
 “The January 30 SC order clearly states that the roles of board members, who are qualified to continue in BCCI office, would be decided by COA. So, there is no question of COA going beyond its brief. The appointment of COA is to ensure the implementation of the Lodha committee's reforms and also conduct the day-today operations of BCCI,” a COA source said on Thursday.
 
 When BCCI office-bearers were contacted by TOI, they were in complete disagreement and said that the apex court would take the ultimate call. “If the office-bearers are non-entities, why are Amitabh and Anirudh the signing authorities in BCCI?” a source representing the BCCI office-bearers asked.
 
 However, the petitioner in the case,  , said the latest letter by BCCI units is a clear case of contempt of court and undermining Rai's team isn't a good sign.
