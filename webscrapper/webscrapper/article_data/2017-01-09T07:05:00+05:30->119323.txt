AMRITSAR: Unhappy with the Congress allotting its ticket for   assembly seat to his estranged uncle and senior party leader Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Punjab Youth Congress former general secretary   quit the party on Sunday to join   (APP), which has been formed by AAP’s former state convener  .

 At the joining, Chhotepur described Deepinder as a “winning candidate”. “He will claim victory by a huge margin,” Chhotepur said.
 
 Deepinder was an aspirant for the party’s ticket from the assembly seat, and had been demanding the Congress high command to allot him the ticket in the youth quota, but was ignored.
 
 Chotepur said APP had announced 48 candidates so far, and would announce another 30 in near future. “Many more known leaders will be joining APP, just wait and watch,” he said. .
 
 He said the party had carried out a survey before allotting the ticket to Deepinder, as he was popular among people of the Dera Baba Nanak constituency. He said APP was giving tickets only to people with a clean image. When asked about the acceptability of APP, which was relatively a new party in Punjab, Chotepur said many regional parties in India were directly competing with national parties. “Similarly, APP would emerge as a clean and strong party capable of challenging all national parties in the state,” he said.
