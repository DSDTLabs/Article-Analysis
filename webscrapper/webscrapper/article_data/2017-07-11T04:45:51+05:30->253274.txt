MUMBAI: Barely few days after the name of Mumbai’s Chhatrapati   Terminus (CST) was changed to  , the Shiv Sena has demanded that the yet-to-come up Mumbai   be named after the Maratha king too.

 Sena Member of Parliament Gajanan Kirtikar, in a letter to House leader Yashwant Jadhav, demanded that the road should be named as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Sagari Mahamarg. Jadhav sought Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar’s approval to bring up the proposal before the group leaders’ meeting on Monday.
 
 The road is chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s pet project but the Sena took the opportunity at Monday’s meeting and demanded that it be named after Shivaji, which received an in-principle approval from members. “Nobody opposed the proposal of naming the coastal road after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, therefore we are keen on it being implemented,” said Mahadeshwar. The BJP too supported the proposal.
 
 Work on BMC’s ambitious coastal road, which will begin 500 metres ahead of the Princess Street flyover at  , is expected to begin after the monsoon. In BMC’s 2015-16 budget, Rs 200 crore had been earmarked for it. In   2016-17 budget too and this year’s budget, BMC made a provision of Rs 1,000 crore for the project. 
 
 In October 2016, BMC began geo-technical investigations for the first phase of the project. As a part of the investigation, soil strata was checked by digging in holes before actual work on the ground begins.
