On Saturday evening, just as the sun was heading home, a group of people -- students, artists, mothers, teachers, -- gathered at Bittan Market, standing together in angst against violence on women. With placards in their hands and slogans on lips like ‘main bhi bahar jaungi’ and ‘abla nahi hai bilkul naari, sangharsh rahega hamesha jari,’ the youngsters marched through the traffic to Shahpura lake. 

 “In every case of violence against women, it is the survivor who is blamed. The recent case of mass molestation of women in Bengaluru is just one of the several examples. Why are women told to confine themselves at home whenever such incidents take place. I have the right to go whenever and wherever I want. If someone has a problem, they should stay at home,” said Ashwarya Agrawal, a film maker and resident of Bhopal. 
 
 A group of youngsters launched a drive called #Iwillgoout and held nationwide protest for women’s right. Bhopal too witnessed a good participation. “Public places can be equally unsafe for men too. Then why the barriers only for women. If we bring about equality in the society, everyone will be benefitted,” said Mohsin Khan, a student. “Our society has double standards when it comes to rights. What is safe for me might not be safe for my sister. We are living in a democratic country and it is about time that such issues are made non-issues,” said Palash Yadav, an MBA student.
 
 Women from all age groups and walks of life took the opportunity to come out and speak about safety of women. “Madhya Pradesh sees a large number of cases of crime against women. Initiatives like this are important as they provide a platform for people to speak on the issue,” said Kokila Bhattacharya. Swastika Chakravarty, a theatre artist and a mother of two said, “I have two daughters. I want them to have the same freedom what my sons would have.”
