NEW DELHI: Delhi State Election Commission (SEC) on Friday produced before the high court the latest electronic voting machine ( ) that will be used in the upcoming  . The court was apprised about its features, such as how it can accommodate a maximum of   at a time.

 SEC also produced the original file relating to its thinking on relaxing a rule that bars registered but unrecognised parties from getting a common election symbol. After going through the file, Justice Hima Kohli remarked that SEC is still “mulling over the matter” and is yet to decide on the issue.
 
 Appearing for SEC, standing counsel Sumeet Pushkarna informed the court that in case it relaxes the rule under challenge by Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India, it may have a situation where a group of 20-25 candidates entering the fray could demand a common symbol.
 
 The counsel explained that it will be a logistical challenge to do it immediately, since EVMs may have to be tagged and even voters can get confused. The commission also told the court that each candidate’s photo is displayed on the machine for benefit of voters and unrecognised parties.
 
 However, Swaraj India contested the stand and argued that SEC is making up conjectures to stall reform and urged the court to intervene. HC wrapped up the hearing into Swaraj India’s plea and reserved its verdict.
 
 On Thursday, HC had asked the poll panel if it intends to give a common symbol to political parties, including Swaraj India, which are registered but unrecognised.
 
 “Whether the state election commission intends to give a common symbol to registered but unrecognised parties? Whether you (poll panel) have written any letter to the authorities concerned in this regard seeking to change the rule?” Justice Kohli had asked SEC.
 
 Swaraj India has alleged that non-allotment of a common symbol to a registered party amounted to discrimination. AAP was granted such a symbol when it contested for the first time.
