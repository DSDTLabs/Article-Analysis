MUMBAI: The Elphinstone tragedy was waiting to happen. While another inquiry has been ordered into the incident which killed 22 people, railways is sitting over recommendations of the   committee which warned in its February 2012 report that the “situation is grim” across Mumbai’s   system.

 The committee said that an estimated 15,000 people die on   tracks every year because of trespassing. “Of this, 6,000 deaths or 40% of the casualties take place on Mumbai's suburban railway  ,” said the report.
 
 The committee had noted: “We feel the grim situation on Mumbai’s suburban system has to be tackled on a war footing. Here, trespassing occurs because of lack of barricading, fencing, lack of adequate number of pedestrian over-bridges and lack of facilities such as sufficient number of platforms, escalators, elevators for the disabled apart from insufficient train services. These are the main reasons for the heavy human death toll.”
 
 A report by the CAG in 2015 had also focused on railway foot-over- bridges (FOBs) and called for more FOBs of prescribed sizes to ensure passenger safety.
