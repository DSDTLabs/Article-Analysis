NEW DELHI: Will the 2018   be a 10-team affair? The IPL Governing Council may not have deliberated on it officially, but indications are that it will take up the issue in the month end meeting to determine the way forward. IPL chairman   categorical said that if the tournament becomes a 10-team affair then   and   could have to go through a fresh bidding process after the two suspended franchises from Chennai and Rajasthan return next year.

 "Next year, as per the Supreme Court order, the two suspended teams would be back. The issue of whether eight or 10 teams will come up at the IPL GC meeting. So far the plan is to go ahead with eight teams. A 10-team league has to be endorsed by the GC. As of today, no extension is being given to both the teams (RPS and Lions). The agreement was only for two years. Even if we make it a 10-team league, the two new teams would have to be freshly bid for, so they are not being given any extension or anything," Shukla said after the IPL GC here, which was attended by CoA members Vinod Rai, Vikram Limaye and Diana Edulji, in the Capital on Sunday.
 
 With a fear of having to host around 84 games, Shukla said that even the broadcaster may not be in favour of 10 teams. However, Gujarat Lions' owner   too consented that the IPL team is for two years but won't mind continuing if the IPL GC is willing.
 
 As reported by TOI earlier, the IPL media rights (broadcast/digital/mobile) will be up for grabs after the IPL and it would be for five years instead of 10 years. It would also be a walk-in tender process. "This is an assessment that we should not go for 10 years. After 5 years we don't know what would be the quantum of the league. The COA was in agreement with everything. Each decision taken unanimously," Shukla said while adding that the retention policy still may be a possibility before the 2018 mega auction.
