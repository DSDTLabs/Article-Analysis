CHENNAI: Snares, meant to capture or kill wild animals, are available in   in rural areas of  , and at present there is law which bans manufacture and sale of these crude metal traps, animal rights activists say.

 Villagers staying close to the forest fringes set up snares to kill crop-raiding animals. In some cases snared are set up for meat. 
 
 Snares meant for spotted deer and sambar could become a death trap for larger carnivores like tiger and leopard, they say.
 
 Coimbatore-based   K Mohan Raj says he has seen sale of different types of snares at a shop which was set up during a temple festival at Anthiyur in   district. This particular temple is located near Erode forest division.
 
 According to Raj, there are three types of snares â€“ rabbit snare (muyal kanni), deer snare (maan kanni) and squirrel snare (anil kanni).The rabbit snare is used for trapping animals such as wild boar, black-napped hare, mouse deer, monitor lizard and other smaller herbivores. The deer snare is meant for poaching spotted deer, sambar and barking deer while the squirrel snare is used to capture medium-sized rodents. 
 
 Poachers lay these snares in paths taken by animals. WWF-India researcher D Boominathan say poachers identify frequented by wild animals and lay traps hidden in a thick bush. Thorny sticks are spread on both side around the bush. The thorny sticks force the animals to pass through the area where snares are laid. Normally the snares are set up after dusk and the poachers come and collect the trapped animals the next day.
 
 At present, there is no law that bans manufacture and sale of snares. In the draft Wildlife Protection Act, both manufacture and sale of snares have been included as an offence, according to Raj.
 
 Lack of periodical anti-snare drive was stated to be the cause of increased wildlife casualties, conceded a wildlife officer. A snare detection drive was conducted in Sathyamangalam last year, he added.
