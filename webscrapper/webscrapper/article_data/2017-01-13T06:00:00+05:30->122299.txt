Classical music-lovers swarmed   way before the scheduled time to watch Carnatic exponents   and   — popularly known as   — work their magic. Although the auditorium was packed with 200-odd guests, the hushed chatter gave way to pin-drop silence the moment the sisters took the stage. Dressed in complementary colours — Ranjani in a green saree with a red border and Gayatri a red one with a green border — like they always do, they started off with a namaskaram to the “rasikas of Hyderabad”. 
Starting the show with Tiruppavai, a traditional Tamil invocation to Lord Narayana in the ragam Aaravi, they instantly took the guests in attendance into a trance. Following it up with Annamacharya, Tyagaraja and Samasastry keerthanas, they effortlessly held the audience’s attention which was only broken by the waves of applause after each song ended. 
 Accompanied by   on the violin,   on the mridangam and   on the ghatam, Ranjani and Gayatri sang in turns and together, giving each other the spotlight through the show. And they didn’t fail to appreciate each other’s prowess every now and then with a “shabash” accentuating the song. They spoke, sang and moved musically — Gayatri even broke into a raga when she had to test her mic for feedback. Smiling and bowing their head in a namasthe after each song, the “dynamic duo”, as they were introduced, had the audience in a trance until they bowed out to a standing ovation.
