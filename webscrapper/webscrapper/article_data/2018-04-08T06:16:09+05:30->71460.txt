CHENNAI:   vice-chancellor   has brushed aside political opposition to his appointment, saying politicians who create such controversies are “out of sync with future generations”.

 Soon after Surappa, a former director of IIT-Ropar, was named the VC on Thursday,   said it was inappropriate to have a person from Karnataka amid a raging Cauvery dispute. PMK leader   took offence to “importing” a person from another state. Actor-politician Kamal Haasan quipped that TN asked for water from Karnataka but got a VC instead.
 
 Surappa, however, is unperturbed. “People have to be educated about such politicians,” he told TOI on Saturday. “This is exactly why we as a country have not been able to perform to our best potential,” he said. The metallurgist with three decades of teaching experience said he would not interfere with the  , but ensure they follow all regulations. “I will acquire a working knowledge of Tamil,” he said.
