Amey Pandya, of Vivah and Toonpur Ka Superhero fame, recently visited the city to attend a film festival organised by a private school. Coming to Lucknow for this event for the past seven years, Amey now shares a special bond with the city. "The feeling of visiting this city is inexpressible. Lucknow trips have always been full of fun and masti. This time, we went to   at   where it took me nearly an hour to see the whole of it.Later, we went to shop for chikan and then tasted the famous dishes of the city," shares Amey, adding, "I find Lucknow a very peaceful city. After coming from Mumbai, this city feels like heaven with less traffic and pollution. Also, I found Lucknowites to be really nice and they respect one a lot."
Sharing one of the incidents from his previous visits, the actor says, "Around five years back, I went to watch a movie here with my sister. And to our surprise, we got surrounded by people as soon as we stepped out of the theatre. But the best part was, if it would have happened in Mumbai, it would have been a crazy affair, but in Lucknow, people were really courteous and waited patiently to meet me, which I liked a lot."
 Amey, who has not been seen on-screen for a very long time, shares that he is going on a break to break the stereotypical image of his as a child actor. "Since past 4-5 years I haven’t taken on any project because I was advised by   sir and   sir that I should take a break at this stage. They said if I continue then my image will always be of a child actor," says the 19-year-old. He adds, "I want to be a full-time actor, and it is better to take at least six years gap from the industry so that my face is forgotten and I can re-appear with a new image in front of the people. This is the age where I can’t fit into a kid’s role as well as play the main lead in a movie. So I’ll make a comeback at the age of 21 or 22."
