NEW DELHI: The   in   and  , home to hundreds of factories, are not only flouting   but also full of   that   firefighting operations. 

 Officials of Delhi Fire Service and the north corporation admit that illegal constructions in factories are a major reason for repeated incidents of fire in the area but little has been done to rein them in. Officials are worried even about establishments that have fire safety certificates as none has any plan to tackle a major fire. “The highrise buildings are our main concern as such a fire can affect neighbouring buildings, which has happened in this case as well,” said Delhi Fire Services chief G C Mishra.
 
 The authorities say at least two major fires are reported from the industrial zone every year. Labourers working in the area said most units didn’t have the required firefighting tools. Factory owners use most of the space to dump raw materials to save money that would have been needed to hire store houses available in the area.
 
 Initial probes have revealed that the building at the F block, where the fire occurred on Saturday, had its exit routes blocked with raw materials, including phosphorous compounds.
 
 Lack of space between buildings hampers the movement of fire personnel and rescuers. Firemen pointed out that though the industrial zone had its own building statutes, there was hardly any monitoring, resulting in illegal constructions and obstruction of free and fast movement even during emergencies.
 
 On Saturday, firefighters could access the first floor of the building almost an hour after reaching the area. They had to scale the walls as the gates too were found locked. Moving through the lanes was also a challenge, said sources. 
 
 The fire services are not required to ask offices with less than 50 seats for fire-safety certification. The owners misuse this clause by classifying their establishments under the small-unit category while submitting the building plan, said a source.
