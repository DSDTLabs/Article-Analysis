PANAJI: The hill on the secluded   beach, a quiet sunset point near  , has been blatantly dug for a structure, allegedly by a local fishermen. The authorities are yet to act on the CRZ violation. 

 The digging and construction had started several days back. But the fishermen continued the work, scooping out the mud from the hill above the secluded beach in gross violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) notification 2011. Few visitors can be seen on this idyllic beach below the curve of the hill on the extreme end of the   shoreline.
 
 With neither the local panchayat nor Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) acting on the illegal activity, a small structure has been already constructed. “Truckloads of laterite stones have arrived at the spot,” a visitor informed STOI on Saturday.
 
 The excavation has left a red gash in the hill above a rock formation. GCZMA officials said that the burden of pending cases and other work makes it difficult for the agency to keep a hawk’s eye on such violations. “We will look into the matter,” Parag Nagarsekar, GCZMA member secretary said.
 
 The work continued for several days and visitors are worried that a passive approach by authorities may spur more illegalities. The long sandy stretch of the Tiswadi coastline from Campal merges into the hill side. Barely, 100 metres ahead, the fort wall of Raj Bhavan skirts the hill towards the sea.
 
 A Taleigao panchayat official said that Aivao doesn’t come under the panchayat jurisdiction. But no Corporation of the City of Panaji official could be contacted to enquire about action taken in the matter.
