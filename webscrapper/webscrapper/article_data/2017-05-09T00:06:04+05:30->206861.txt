Mumbai: Suburban train commute can become more comfortable as the authorities plan to introduce 75   across   (WR) and   (CR) in the new   that is likely by October.

 Officials said introduction of the services was discussed at a review meeting chaired by railway board member (traffic) Mohamed Jamshed here on Monday. Union railway minister Suresh Prabhu later tweeted, “Mem Traffic review. 40 new services on #Mumbai western & central each from 2nd oct with new time table MRVC works reviewed by MT too.”
 
 Source said CR plans at least 40 new services; 14 are likely on Trans-harbour, 12 on Harbour and remaining on Main line. Although Prabhu said the new time-table will come up in October, CR may introduce the services by August, depending on rake availability. On the Main line, introduction can be held up till October as the long-distance time-table is also being revised and the timings should not clash with suburban services.
 
 On WR, 35 new services are likely, of which 10 will be with 15-car rakes. A senior official said most of the services will cater to the Andheri-Virar belt.
 
 At the review, Jamshed suggested both railways should work on improving headway. The average headway between trains on CR and WR is four minutes. If this can be reduced, more services can be introduced to distribute passenger load, but the inter-signal distance will have to come down to around 470m, as against 700-800m in some sections. The shorter the distance between signals, the faster can be the movement of trains, officials explained.
 
 Jamshed told the authorities to study passenger profile and movement in various suburban zones, besides expediting suburban projects. The pace of suburban projects under   (MUTP) is a cause for concern; there has been no “progress” on the ground for laying of 5th and 6th lines between CST-Kurla and sixth line between Borivli-Mumbai Central.
