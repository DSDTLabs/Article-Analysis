Panaji: The ninth edition of   da Cultura Indo Portuguesa (Goa) will commence with a Portuguese film festival at Maquinez Palace, on Friday.

 The event is organised annually and aims at celebrating and appreciating the rich, cultural flavours of both, India and Portugal.
 
 Curated by the director of Communicare Trust Nalini Elvino de Souza, and Goa University’s Portuguese professor Delfim Correia Da Silva, the film festival will open with the movie, Comboio Noturno para Lisboa (Night train to Lisbon) by Bille August, and will conclude on Sunday. 
 
 The event will also include a fado singing competition, music and creative writing workshops, and an evening of Indo-Portuguese cuisine and music. 
 
 Francisco Duarte Azevedo, the newly-appointed Consul General of Portugal in Goa, is the convener of the executive committee planning the event, while Audhut Caro is its chairman.
 
 “Goa has assimilated the essence of both regions (India and Portugal) where people coexist in harmony and joy. Through this event, we would like to share and enjoy the essence of our diverse culture,” Caro said.
 
 A fado singing competition will be held on November 10 at Institute Menezes Braganza. The event will also bring forth popular musical event, Vem Cantar, and a Goan short story competition.
