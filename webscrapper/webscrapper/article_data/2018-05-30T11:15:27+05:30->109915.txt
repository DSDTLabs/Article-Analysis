KOTTAYAM: While the family of   struggled to hold back tears, the young woman from Thenmala – who dreamt of a married life with the Mannanam resident – took a decision that she would stay with the family as their daughterin-law. Her father-in-law, Joseph, stood by her decision. “How can my cousins Ishan and Niyas murder   without the knowledge of my parents. I don’t want to stay with them,”   Chacko said. Last Friday, both Kevin and Neenu had filled up an online application to register their marriage. Their marriage has not been legalized yet as it would be technically valid only after a notice is stuck on the bulletin board of the sub-registrar office for a month and the couple, later, signing the documents in the presence of witnesses.

 
 Neenu had left home saying that she had to appear for an exam. She then informed her family after the online application was submitted. Her cousin Niyas then threatened Kevin that they will not live together. He tried to take her home saying that her father was unwell, but she saw through the lie and refused to return home.
 
 Kevin’s father said that Neenu’s family tried to trick her one more time. This time her brother Sanu Chacko came and said that Neenu’s mother wanted to see her and that she should come home. Sanu had come in the same Innova that was used to kidnap Kevin later, claimed Joseph. He said his son’s murder was well-planned and that Neenu’s kin had stayed in   for some days. He also suspected that they received help from CPM workers.
