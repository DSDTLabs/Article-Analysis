CHENNAI: The   on Tuesday refused to permit urgent hearing of cases relating to police violence on   and others in Chennai and other parts of the state, but asked the state advocate-general to ensure proper treatment to those admitted in hospital with injuries. 

 At least three more petitions are likely to be filed and heard, along with two other pleas already pending before the court.
 
 In the morning, soon after Justice R Mahadevan assumed the seat, advocates K Balu and AP Suryaprakasam made a mention of the Monday's violence unleashed on the protesters and sought action. While Balu, who is also president of Advocates Forum for Social Justice, sought to highlight the excesses on peaceful protesters, Congress lawyer Suryaprakasam sought to highlight the reported disparaging remarks being made by BJP Rajya Sabha member   against Tamils, and to demand ban on the operations of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA).
 
 The judge said they could file their petitions, but they would be heard in normal course. He declined to offer them a lunch motion.
 
 Later, advocate and human rights activist V Suresh made a mention of the matter and even as the matter relating to ordinance for jallikattu was over, the police action on innocent people continued. Noting that it was a matter to be considered by the court, he said police had entered houses and damaged household articles. Even while injured people were taking treatment in a hospital, police tore slips issued to outpatients. Police interfered with treatment being given to inpatients, as well, he said.
 
 Justice Mahadevan asked the advocate to furnish proof and details of his averments and directed the advocate-general to see that proper treatment was given to inpatients in hospitals. Hearings on the petitions which were filed by Parvendhan and Senthilkumar and pending consideration, was adjourned to Wednesday for further hearing.
