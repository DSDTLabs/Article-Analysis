LUCKNOW: Posing a serious threat to Modi government’s goal of making India a TB-free nation by 2025, a staggering 11 lakh tuberculosis cases are being missed in the country only because private sector doctors and medical institutions do not notify them. Of these 11 lakh, 3.5 lakh missed cases are in Uttar Pradesh.

 “Over 28 lakh   cases surface in India every year of which 14 lakh are listed by government hospitals. Following emphasis on getting TB cases in private sector notified, 3.5 lakh cases were reported from private hospitals but it is not enough,” said Prof  , vice-chairman, Revised National TB Control Programme ( ) task force — a body of experts constituted by Union ministry of health and family welfare.
 
  has pledged to eradicate TB, declared as a notifiable disease in 2012, by 2025.
 
 Prasad spoke to TOI on Friday after addressing a meeting to sensitise private medical colleges authorities which cater to about 7% of TB cases in private sector. “The private sector in UP needs to wake up. Their participation has been lower than the national average,” said Prasad citing figures.
 
 “It is estimated that 50% of all TB cases go to private sector and were not being notified. In 2017, 25% of the 14 lakh missed TB cases in India were tracked, but UP could mobilise notification of only 7.5% of the 4 lakh missed cases,” he said.
 
 “In strict sense, TB elimination means there should be less than one case of TB for a population of 10 lakh. But the current rate of decline in cases (1.5% per annum) suggests that the target is too far,” he explained.
 
 State TB officer   said that a number of steps are being taken to engage private sector in TB control programme. “It is social responsibility of private doctors to notify cases for which they need to register on health ministry’s Nikshay webpage.
