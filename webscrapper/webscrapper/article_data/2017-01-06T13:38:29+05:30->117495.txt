RAIPUR: The   of Indian Psychiatric Society ANCIPS-2017 got underway on Thursday. The conference underlined the urgent need to address the problem of shortage of psychiatrists in the country. 

 Inaugurating the conference, chief minister   said that mental health issues like anxiety, lack of tolerance and stress among urban and rural population are on the rise mainly due to lifestyle changes, rise in nuclear families and many other factors. He assured that the state government would seriously consider recommendations to implement them.
 
 Ever since the state was formed, the chief minister said, the government has been making efforts to improve health infrastructure in the state. Now, the state has 10 medical colleges, including few in the private sector, and the health sector has been his government's area of focus. 
 
 Earlier in his welcome speech, ANCIPS-2017 organising chairman  , quoting World Health Organisation (WHO) report, pointed out that there has to be one psychiatrist for 35,000 population. Considering the population of Chhattisgarh, the state needs 572 psychiatrists but there are only 28 psychiatrists, both private as well as in government sector.
 
 Similarly, India needs at least 3.71 lakh psychiatrists for a population of about 1.30 billion but there are only 5,730 registered psychiatrists in India. He said that a large number of posts of psychiatrists in hospitals are lying vacant and there is an urgent need to start post-graduate courses in medical colleges to meet the growing demand.
 
  On behalf of the conference, he requested chief minister Raman Singh to consider starting a PG course in psychiatry at   in the state capital.
 
  president Dinesh Bhugra, Indian Psychiatric Society president  , general secretary Dr Gautam Saha, renowned psychiatrists and foreign delegates are attending the four-day conference based on the theme 'Psychiatry-Reaching the unreached.'
