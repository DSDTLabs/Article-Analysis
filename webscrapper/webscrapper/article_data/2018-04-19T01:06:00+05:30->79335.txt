MUMBAI:   on Wednesday signed the suspension order of   of   Jivak Ghegadmal, designated officer Rohini Deshmukh and a beat ward officer for failure to take action against an unauthorized nine-storey building in south Mumbai’s congested Pydhonie area. 

 “For now, the charge of C ward has been given to the assistant municipal commissioner of B ward Udaykumar Shirookar,” said a senior civic official, requesting anonymity. However, no action has been taken against the building on Ismail Karte Road yet.
 
 On March 27, the issue was debated in the legislative assembly and presiding officer Sudhakar Deshmukh directed the government to suspend the assistant municipal commissioner of C ward. Minister of state for urban development Ranjeet Patil had assured the suspension. 
 
 Last week, the BMC wrote to the   seeking directions on the issue, and in its reply on Monday, the government sought clarity on why no action was taken against the illegal building though a notice was served under Section 354 A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888. The state government also gave the suspension order against the civic officials and sought a report on the illegal building in seven days.
