A source close to the actor reveals that Sanjay will be back from Agra soon and will head to Dubai with wife Manayata and twins Shahraan and Iqra for a 10-day break.
“It's been a hectic schedule with multiple injuries. First, he was accidently hit on the head, leaving him with a nasty bruise. Then, he suffered a hairline fracture in the ribs and travelled to Chambal and Jaipur wearing a rib belt.So, the plan is to just rest and spend time with the kids. Sanjay has promised to take them to their favourite barbeque joint while he's there,“ informs the source.
 
 Once they are back, the actor will return to the sets to picturise a song.
