DALTONGANJ: The weekly   (goat markets) in the villages of   wear a deserted look ever since the government has declared to crack down on   and slaughterhouses. 

 The buyers of Garhwa visit Muri   in Uttar Pradesh’s Wyndhamganj police station on the border of Jharkhand to procure goats. After the government order now there are no buyers in this once-busy market even as sellers are many. 
 
 The sale and purchase of goats have come down drastically after the administration began shutting illegal slaughterhouses in the villages under Palamu’s Narsinghpur Pathra, Lamee Pathra and Satbarwa.
 
 A goat rearer, Don, who lives at Nawa Toli in Daltonganj said, “I used to bring goats from Allahabad as they have big ears and can adjust to new food habits sooner than other breed of goats. But with this situation around I have stopped bringing in any more goats.” 
 
 “Buying goats and then taking care of them at times like this when business has come to a total halt is a big drain on our purse,” said Qutub, a meat seller in Daltonganj.
