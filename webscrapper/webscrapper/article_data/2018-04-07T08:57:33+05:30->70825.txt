MADIKERI: This wedding season,   nuptials, have become a lot less ‘spirited’ and weddings families blame it on the strict enforcement of the model code of conduct. It is a long standing tradition to serve liquor at weddings, but   say poll officials are not allowing them to treat their guests to a drink or three because the code is in force.

 District police claim liquor can be served after obtaining permission from the excise department, but the running around from pillar to post is a massive bother.
 
 Under the model code of conduct, distribution of liquor and other alcoholic beverages has been banned across the state except in a few permitted places like bars and restaurants, wine shops and similar establishments. As a result, Kodava families celebrating a wedding have been left high and dry.
 
 Madhu P, a businessman from the   who belongs to the   family, said: “We buy liquor from wine shops and keep them in the reception hall for guests who want to drink. This is a tradition which we have been following for generations. But ever since the code of conduct was implemented, families have been forced to stop serving liquor fearing police action.”
 
 The code has also hit tourism in the district, which is known for its homestays. Homestay owners say the number of tourists has dropped by 50%. Raja’s Seat, a popular homestay in  , says it used to see between 500 and 1,000 guests per day, but that has now fallen to 200 to 300 visitors. “We serve alcohol, but now police are saying storing alcohol is a crime,” said one homestay owner.
 
 Police, however say they are only implementing the rules. Rajendra Prasad, SP, said alcohol can be served at weddings if permission is obtained from the excise department. “Homestays anyway don’t have permission to sell liquor,” Prasad said. “Many homestays are operating without required permission. Only they are facing a problem because we are implementing the rules.”
