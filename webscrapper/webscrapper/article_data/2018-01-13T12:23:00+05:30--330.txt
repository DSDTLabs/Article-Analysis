THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State   has saved as many as 29 children in 10 days from four districts in the state. 

 The special drive-Sarana Balyam-launched for the rescue of children from child labour and begging was first introduced in   district during Sabarimala mandala season last year. 
 
 The programme was replicated in Kollam, Alappuzha and   districts this year. The activities of the child rescue force in these districts began just 10 days ago. Seven boys and five girls were rescued from   district. The number of children rescued from other districts are the following: Kottayam (4 boys), Alappuzha (2 boys and 2 girls), Kollam (3 boys/ 6 girls). 
 
 Of the 29 children rescued, 22 were from Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Uthar Pradesh, Utharakhand and Rajasthan. Most of them were brought to pilgrim centres in the state for the sale of chains and bangles and also for jobs at hotels.
 
 The child rescue team has also identified Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta native children engaged in child labour. The rescue team has found out that in many cases the children were not adequately fed or provided safe shelter. All the 29 children rescued from various places were produced before respective district child welfare committees. Non-Malayali children were being presented before the child welfare committees of their native states. Three children who were engaged in child labour in Pathanamthitta district were sent to their homes with their parents on the basis of their assurance that they would be sent to school. 
 
 Adequate steps were also taken to ensure that they attend school regularly. Arrangements have been made for conducting DNA tests to ensure that the people who claim to be childrens' parents are indeed their real parents.
