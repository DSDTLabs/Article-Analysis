PUNE: The   is planning to outsource its services for providing burn victims with better medical facilities. 

 The   ( ) is considering a proposal to hand over its burns ward facility at the Kamala Nehru hospital to some private player, which will have to provide services at government rates for the benefits of the financially weaker sections of society.
 
 Members of the newly elected PMC have tabled the proposal before the standing committee. The proposal states that as the patient load on the Sassoon General hospital is high, a facility to treat the burn victims at the Kamala Nehru hospital will help the poor. 
 
 “Skilled staffers can be roped in from private players to run the facility. The PMC should ensure space and infrastructure. It should not charge rent from the operator,” the proposal states.
 
 Corporator Arvind Shinde, who has come up with the proposal, said, “Treatment of burn cases is expensive and people from financially weaker sections find it difficult to afford it. The private player should ensure the treatment cost in accordance with   rates.” 
 
 On Wednesday, the standing committee discussed the proposal. “ Details such as project feasibility and how to run the health centre will be sought. Bids will be invited once the standing committee’s approval comes,” said ST Pardeshi, head of the PMC’s health department.
 
 A doctor with a private hospital here said treatment for burn injuries can range anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 2.5 lakh.
