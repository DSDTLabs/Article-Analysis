PUNE: A recent   survey has found   from Indian consumers for stronger protection  . 

 A cellphone-based survey by Pune-based Animal Equality revealed that 86% agree that animals killed for food should not be tortured. 
 
 This survey was carried out by IPSOS— a global market research and a consulting firm with worldwide headquarters in Paris—among 1,000 urban adults in 11 cities, including Pune, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Jaipur, Mumbai and Shillong.
 
 More than four out of five% respondents were of the opinion that they would prefer food companies that follow animal welfare standards. In addition, 82% said they will choose a food company which follows animal welfare standards over a company that does not.
 
 Amruta Ubale, executive director of Animal Equality, said that many food companies in hospitality, restaurant, food manufacturing and food service sectors abroad have animal welfare policies. “These policies prevent unnecessary suffering of animals and are in line with the companies’ sustainability, environment and other corporate social responsibilities policies. We have reached out to more than 50 food companies requesting them to introduce policies to reduce the unnecessary suffering of animals,” she said.
 
 Much of the animal agriculture business in India follows the factory farm model. “Factory farming is not just cruel to animals but also devastating to the environment. Intensive animal production is a key contributor to air, water and soil pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation,” she added.
