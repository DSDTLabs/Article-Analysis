NEW DELHI: The Income Tax department on Tuesday served a notice on   - founder director of   and husband of   CEO and MD   - asking him to explain alleged investments received from two entities based in Mauritius and furnish details as to who all are directors in these two companies.

 An I-T source said, Kochhar had allegedly received huge funds, running into hundreds of crores, from overseas entities and the department is investigating the trail of finances and people behind these 'investments'.
 
 Deepak Kochhar is already being investigated by the CBI in connection with certain investments made by   chairman Venugopal Dhoot in his NuPower Renewables. The CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against officials of the ICICI Bank and others for a loan of Rs 3,250 crore extended to the Videocon group. The group had secured Rs 40,000 crore loan from a consortium of banks, led by SBI.
 
 Dhoot and his Videocon group is being investigated for the bank loans turning into NPAs. The CBI is also investigating allegations of a quid pro quo as Chanda Kochhar was part of the panel that decided on behalf of a consortium of 12 banks to extend huge credit to the Dhoot's Videocon group. Dhoot later invested in Kochhar's NuPower Renewables.
 
 He, however, has denied allegations of a quid pro quo and also rejected reports that he had made investment of Rs 64 crore in Kochhar's NuPower Renewables or having transferred any money in the company through Mauritius.
 
 ICICI Bank has also denied charges of a quid pro quo against Chanda Kochhhar in extending a line of credit to Videocon.
