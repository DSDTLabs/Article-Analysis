VADODARA: The discovery of a fossil of a dinosaur egg at the Beedna Muvada village of   taluka of   district has generated interest.   (GSI) have been called to identify the fossil.

 Sources said that the village is located eight to 10 km from Raiyoli where one of the largest hatcheries of dinosaurs once existed. Fossils of both dinosaurs and their eggs were found at Raiyoli following which a dinosaur park has come up at the site.
 
 The dinosaur egg was an accidental discovery when a man spotted it and informed the village sarpanch. “The sarpanch and forest officials, who were also called, informed us regarding the egg. Someone had dug a pit there and left it open,” said   executive magistrate Vijaya Vala.
 
 Vala added that the man who spotted the egg fossil had seen similar fossils at Raiyoli during a visit there. It was the similarity between the rock that he saw the egg fossils at Raiyoli that made him inform the sarpanch, said Vala.
 
 The officials who reached the spot also called the scion of the Balasinor royal family princess Aaliya Sultana Babi who has worked extensively on the dinosaur park and the preservation of the fossils there. Forest officials said that Babi too was of an opinion that the fossil was of a dinosaur. “She also knew researchers at GIS who will see the fossil whenever it is possible for them to visit,” said range forest officer P R  .
 
 Officials added that the pit may have been dug up to remove rocks for construction of the foundation of houses or some other construction work. The rocks available locally are used widely for the purpose.
