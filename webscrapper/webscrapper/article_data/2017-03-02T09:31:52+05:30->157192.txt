INDORE: A joint team of district administration and Indore municipal corporation ( ) on Wednesday removed over 20 sheds extended above the permissible limit on a 3.3 kilometre stretch of   ( ) corridor.

 With an aim to free the most crowded and used traffic lane of the city from encroachment, the administration launched its second phase of anti-encroachment drive between Rajeev Gandhi and Navlakha squares.
 
 Bhawarkuan police accompanied the team to deal with any untoward incident.
 
 “The drive that started at around 1.30 pm and lasted for next three hours saw removal of 20 illegal sheds. Also, challans were issued against truck owners and transporters, whose vehicles were parked illegally on the corridor,” said the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sandeep Soni, who led the drive.
 
  A similar drive on the same stretch but on other side of the corridor was carried out around a week ago, he added.
 
 “With the drive, the stretch of BRTS has been completely freed from encroachment, while those used to park the vehicles on the corridor have been penalized and warned for not to violate traffic rules in future” Soni said.
 
 The team also removed as many as three kiosks illegally erected on footpath. The drive aimed to ensure smooth traffic flow on BRTS.
 
 The SDM said that similar drive on remaining part of BRTS i.e. from Navlakha square to   will be started soon.
 
 Meanwhile, the authority is working to address the issue of traffic jam in several parts of the city, including, near Press Complex, GPO Square in order to ensure uninterrupted traffic flow at the corridor.
 
 “Work related to improve traffic system at BRTS is being carried out on a war footing level,” said Soni.
 
 Besides, IDA has started the work to develop two underpasses at BRTS corridor.
