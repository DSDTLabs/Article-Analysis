BANGA:  ' siting MLA   has filed his nomination papers as an independent candidate from Doaba region on Tuesday after party gave ticket to Satnam   for the Banga seat.

 Soondh rebelled after party ticket was allotted to Satnam Singh Kainth. He had levelled serious allegations against Kainth and had claimed that even as Punjab Congress chief Captain   wanted him to be fielded but “those forces in Congress who did not want Amarinder to become CM” were behind denial of ticket to him.
 
 Sources in Congress said that Amarinder did try to dissuade him from contesting independently but latter did not relent as he was not ready to compromise on anything less than ticket from Banga. Tarlochan Soondh is son of the late Chaudhary Jagat Ram who remained a very senior leader of Congress in the state.
 
 Meanwhile, SAD, too, received a jolt as former SGPC general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhahur, one of the prominent protégés of the late Akali Dal stalwart and former SGPC chief Gurcharan Singh Tohra joined AAP.
 
 AAP chief   visited Bhaur’s residence here on Tuesday late evening to welcome him in the party fold. Bhaur, who remained vice president of SGPC when Jathedar Tohra was its president in nineties and then general secretary for quite a few years till recently, was a major dissenting voice within SGPC who opposed several decisions including controversial pardon to Sirsa Dera chief by Sikh clergy. He had resigned from SAD after Bargari sacrilege incident and then subsequent firing on Sikh protestors in Behbal Kalan in October 2015.
 
 With his joining AAP, the attempts of anti-Badal groups to form a common platform with Sikh identity have also fizzled out. He and former Punjab assembly speaker Ravi Inder Singh along with other dissenting Akali leaders had formed Akhand Akali Dal.
