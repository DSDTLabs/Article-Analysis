AURANGABAD: While the   are planning to bring giraffes and zebras here in the city’s   Zoo to increase the variety of animals in the facility and make it more attractive for the visitors, a death of a 40-year-old   on Friday is seen a setback to their attempts.

 As per the zoo authorities, the bear died because of old age at 5.30 am on Friday. “The male bear was not keeping well for the past few days and thus it was kept under observation. However, he was not responding to medicine,” said Sanjay Nandan, the zoo supervisor.
 
 Nandan said the life expectancy of bear is between 36 and 38 years. 
 
 After the death of the animal, the zoo authorities called a team of forest officers who performed various tests before confining the mortal remains of the 
 animals to ashes.
 
 The forest official had handed over the bear to the zoo authorities in 2005. At present, the zoo is home for over 300 animals belonging to 22 spices.
