LUDHIANA:   (SAD) president and deputy chief minister   on Sunday lashed out against  . Speaking at a rally organised at Raikot for SAD candidate Inder Iqbal Singh Atwal, Badal termed Sidhu as an opportunist who is "day-dreaming" about becoming chief minister of Punjab.

 Badal also urged Punjabis to evaluate Sidhu’s behavior and past record and decide whether he could be trusted with their vote or support ever again. “This man has taken more turns than any cricket pitch in the world. From singing praises to the SAD-BJP combine, he has courted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and has now landed on the lap of the most hated Congress party. His shelf life in the Congress is also likely to be very short,” the SAD president added. 
 
 Badal said, “Now please tell the people what stopped you from entering Punjab and meeting Punjabis after resigning from the Rajya Sabha seven months back. It’s obvious your commercial interests in Mumbai were more important to you than the people of Punjab. Even now you have waited till the last minute to stake a claim in Punjab politics.” He also said, “This is why he stabbed his former self acclaimed guru Arun Jaitely in the back by opposing the latter’s candidature from Amritsar.” Badal said Sidhu left the BJP for the same reason when it was made apparent to him by the BJP that he would not be anointed as its undisputed leader in Punjab.
 
 The SAD president said that Sidhu like fellow comedian Bhagwant Mann had also started nurturing ambitions of becoming the chief minister of the state. “This is why he held protracted negotiations with both AAP and the Congress before joining the latter today. AAP had promised the deputy CM’s chair to Sidhu. It is obvious he has been given a better deal by Rahul Gandhi,” he added.
