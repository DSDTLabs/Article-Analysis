CHENNAI: The modular treatment plant at   was inaugurated by the Municipal Administration Minister, SP Velumani, on Tuesday, starting off the 4MLD water supply to areas like Kodambakkam, Valsaravakkam, and Alandur.

 The lake water will be treated and sent to the Porur distribution station – also the receiving point for water from the Veeranam tank - and then will be distributed to areas 10, 11 and 12 under the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB).
 
 The plant was set up at a cost of Rs. 1.85 crore after an experimental check on the usability of water from the lake for drinking purposes. Work on the plant began on May 18, the second experimental project, to increase the water supply to the dry city. The previous project was to source water from unused quarries in  , and pumping it to the city from the Chembarambakkam treatment plant.
 
 After multiple testing of   at the King’s Institute in Guindy, it was concluded that water from the Porur Lake can be used for drinking purposes provided it is treated properly.
 
 The lake has a capacity of nearly 46 mcft, of which there is currently 10 mcft of water present that can be used for 100 days.
 
 “This is a modular plant, which means that we can supply anywhere from 0.5MLD to 4MLD to nearby areas and suply from the plant can be downzied if we have another plant coming up nearby in future, according to the total capacity of both plants,” a CMWSSB official said.
 
 Officials said that water from Porur Lake would be used as a permanent source of water and not only for dry summer days.
 
 Besides the regular supply of 200 MLD from the desalination plants in Nemmeli and Minjur and 30 MLD from stone quarries, the city also gets 80MLD from the Neyveli Lignite
