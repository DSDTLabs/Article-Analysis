JAIPUR:   (JCTSL) has decided to   of hundred  . With this, fleet of   will now be replaced with existing ones in June. 

 JCTSL had ordered new buses as many existing rear-engine buses were in need of maintenance and their performance was poor. The firm had to deliverer new buses in March. However, after the  's order, JCTSL cancelled the delivery and asked for buses with upgraded model. 
 
 According to JCTSL officials, the company has sought three months' time to deliver new buses. "We have asked the company to deliver BS-IV buses which follows Supreme Court guidelines. New buses will be delivered till June end," said a JCTSL official. 
 
 Since JCTSL has purchased low-floor buses, it is incurring heavy losses on operation and maintenance. Presently, only half of low-floor buses fleet plying on city roads is in perfect condition. 
 
 As these buses require huge maintenance cost and provide less mileage, JCTSL always face shortage of funds. "Process to replace the existing buses started in 2014. However, purchase process was stalled due to delay in appointment of a private operator for maintenance. Work order to purchase new buses was released after an operator was appointed in 2016," added an official. 
 
 Officials are apprehensive that JCTSL might not receive Centre government assistance due to the delay. Under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme the Centre has assured to provide funds, if buses are purchased till March. Now, the JCTSL has written a letter to Centre to provide the amount, which will lapse in March. 
 
 Sources in the department said, "As per the rules, it is necessary to complete either eight years or 6 lakh kilometres for replacement of a bus. However, in this scenario, none of the condition is fulfilled as buses purchased earlier proved to be inferior," he said.
