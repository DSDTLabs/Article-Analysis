Vadodara: The fire, which broke out at Jambuva landfill site on Friday, was eventually brought under control on Monday morning.  The landfill site managed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been under scanner for the last couple of years with residents complaining that it was spreading terrible stench in the area and not being managed scientifically. After a series of complaints, the civic body had installed a fogging system to see that the smell emanating from the site was taken care of. Suresh Palamel, president of Federation of Vadodara Residents Associations (FVRA), who has been making representations regarding the problem said that the site was an environment and health hazard. He added that the fire had led to smoke entering a school premises on Monday morning before it was controlled.  “If the VMC does not take care of the situation, we will be forced to conduct an agitation,” said Palamel. Congress state general secretary Narendra Ravat and his wife Ami Ravat, who is also a VMC councillor, too served a notice to the government regarding the issue. They have demanded an inquiry into the the solid waste management facilities in the city. The notice also seeks compensation for those who had to live in the polluted environment. It also raised the issue of soot spoiling the houses and belongings of those staying in the area. VMC officials said that the fire had taken place in an area where the civic body was not working.
