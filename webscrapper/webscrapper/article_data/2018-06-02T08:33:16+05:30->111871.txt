KOLKATA: In what is being perceived as yet another blow to the financial stability of the country, the Special Task Force officials of  , which has carried out four arrests and recovered fake currency of face value of Rs 15 lakh, has claimed that 13 out of 17 security features available on the new Rs 2000 note have been replicated by the racketeers. Forensic examination of the fake currencies recovered four months ago had revealed that eight of the 17 features were compromised then.

 
 The fresh revelations were made after cops nabbed the fourth dealer, identified as Sattar Sheikh (47), on Thursday around 6.25pm from the south-east gate of the   bus stand in the   area. The cops recovered fake currency of face value of Rs 4 lakh from the resident of Jharkhand’s Rajmahal. “He had hid the currencies in specially designed undergarments. Only on thorough search, we could recover the fake notes,” said a senior   officer.
 
 The features replicated this time are the watermark, Ashoka Pillar emblem, the letters ‘Rs 2000’ on the left, the guarantee clause with the RBI governor’s signature and the denomination number in   on the front. In the earlier seizure it was found that eight features had been replicated.
 
 Sources in   claimed that the fake currencies — all of them Rs 2000 new notes — carry security threads with them. “The security thread is still not that fine. But these are definitely much better than what was coming to the city since last December. Most of the earlier fake notes were mere photocopies. These are actual prints,” said a senior officer.
