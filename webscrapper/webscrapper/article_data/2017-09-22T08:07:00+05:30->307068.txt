Ludhiana: Nearly two weeks after the new managing committee of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) was formed, cracks are beginning to appear within the office bearers of rival groups within one of the largest industrial bodies of the city. 

 In a fresh twist on Wednesday evening, Inderjit Singh Navyug president of UCPMA (who belongs to Vishivkarma group) called an urgent meeting of the association and barred general secretary Rajiv Jain and joint secretary Satnam Singh Makkar (both from Kular-Seth group) from representing the association under any capacity until further notice. Navyug also ordered that no member or delegation would meet any government official or private person and company on behalf of UCPMA without his consent. 
 
 The development comes a day after Jain and Makkar met GST commissioner Ashutosh Baranwal, Ludhiana along with Gurmeet Kular, president of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) and submitted a memorandum to the commissioner on the letterhead of UCPMA. The issue snowballed into a controversy after Jain on the same day released a press note about the meeting on behalf of UCPMA and mentioned Kular’s as the ex-president of the association. 
 
 Accusing Jain and Makkar of indiscipline, Navyug has asked both of them to give a written explanation for their actions, after which the managing committee will decide on the next course of action. Meanwhile speaking to TOI, Navyug said, “This is very unfortunate that both the general secretary and joint secretary organised a meeting with the GST commissioner on behalf of UCPMA without informing the president or other managing committee members. It’s more shocking that they gave the memorandum on the official letterhead of the association and later released a press statement on behalf of association. We have asked both Jain and Makkar for their reply on the issue and until then they have been restricted from doing any kind of work related to our association”
