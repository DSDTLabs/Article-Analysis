DAVANAGERE: A couple married for three days committed suicide in  's   late Wednesday night, and the son from the husband's first marriage also ended his life hours later. 

  The couple has been identified as Nataraj, 45, and  , 24; and the boy Pradeep, 17. 
 
  Nataraj, who lost his first wife recently, married Pallavi, nearly two decades younger, at a ceremony three days ago. Pallavi tied the knot despite her parents' strong opposition to the match. 
 
 Police said Pallavi's parents and relatives met Nataraj on Wednesday and urged him to register his property to Pallavi so that his son Pradeep doesn't inherit assets.
 
  Nataraj reportedly promised them he would look into their request and sought time. But Pallavi's parents were in a hurry and threatened to call off the marriage if the bequeathing of the property wasn't done immediately. 
 
 This led to an ugly spat and verbal exchanges between Nataraj and the bride's family. Angry and hurt over the incident, Nataraj and Pallavi hanged themselves from the branch of a mango tree in their farmland after Wednesday night.
 
 When he stepped out of the house in the morning, Pradeep was shocked to see the bodies of his father and stepmother, rushed back and hanged himself at their house.
