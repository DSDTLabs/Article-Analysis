NEW DELHI: The   ( ) on Wednesday slammed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) over its submission that   was responsible for high levels of ammonia in  , which was affecting the water supply in Delhi and said that the river had been reduced to a ‘sewer’ in the capital as well.

 A bench headed by Justice Jawad Rahim asked DJB what it had done on its part to clean the Yamuna water and said that NGT was concerned about the river as a whole and not interested in the issue of water sharing dispute between the two states. The tribunal will further hear the matter on March 9. “Why are you picking up things here and there?” asked the bench on Wednesday. “We are only concerned with the pollution in Yamuna. You are coming up with a new plea each time. We are interested in the entire stretch of river Yamuna and not confined to segments. We are not going to compartmentalise Yamuna as it is all one ecosystem,” said the bench.
 
 The bench also said that Yamuna in the territory of Delhi had become a   line and asked DJB what its contribution had been towards the river. “You want Haryana to give you more water for dilution of the pollutants in the river but show us what have you done so far,” said the bench. During the proceedings on Wednesday, the counsel for DJB said that Haryana should be asked to release more water. The Haryana counsel, however, opposed the submission and said DJB should instead look at increasing the capacity of its water treatment plants. TNN
