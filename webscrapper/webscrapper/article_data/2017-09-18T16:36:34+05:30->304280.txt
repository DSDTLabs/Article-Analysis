Actor Eva   is hoping to raise awareness for metastatic breast cancer after her sister was diagnosed with the disease. Reportedly, the 42-year-old star said although her sister was lucky enough to have detected it early, the process has still scared her family.

  
  
 "It was a couple years ago. I never said anything [at the time] because it was a private thing. It was my special needs sister too so she had a hard enough life as it is," Longoria said. 
 
 "She got it early, stage 1, mammogram. We were lucky. But one in three women who get breast cancer get metastatic breast cancer, where it spreads throughout the body. So I thought, how many people don't know about this? And if I have a platform that can help women learn about this, if I have a platform that can help raise funds to find a cure for it, that's even better," she said.
