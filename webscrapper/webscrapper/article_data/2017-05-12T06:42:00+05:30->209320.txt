Ranchi: Officials of the Indian Railways’ Northern Railway (NR) division on Thursday said they will impose a hefty “financial penalty” on the catering company that was entrusted to serve meals on board the New Delhi – Ranchi   after Wednesday’s debacle. 

 Neeraj Sharma, chief of public relations of the NR, told TOI that the division will impose a penalty on the New Delhi-based company Ambuj Caterers and initiate an enquiry as the firm’s contract ends on Friday. 
 
 “This is an unprecedented event in the history of NR. We will impose heavy penalty on the company and initiate an enquiry into the matter even though its contract ends on May 12,” Sharma said.
 
 According to the NR officials, the four-year-old contract of the company was suspended on May 8, four days before its closure, on grounds of repeated complaints about the quality of food being served. Catering services on board Rajdhani Express will be taken over from the NR by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism and Corporation (IRCTC). IRCTC has hired another New Delhi-based catering company for the purpose. 
 
 Wednesday’s fiasco may be triggered from the suspension of contract. “The company told us that its staff did not turn up for work,” a senior NR official said. 
 
 Train attendants, who reached Ranchi on Thursday morning, claimed most of the contractual staff was convinced that they will not get their salary even if they worked as the company’s contract was suspended. 
 
 Passengers have long been complaining about the quality of the food being served on the Rajdhani Express. Last year, two passengers had posted photographs of insects in pulses and rice that were served on board the train. Passengers also faced various problems during winters. With the train running hours behind its schedule due to fog in Northern India, many passengers claimed that the catering company did not serve them meals because of timing delays.
