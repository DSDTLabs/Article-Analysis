 and   are reportedly shooting in Bangkok currently for their upcoming film  . And it seems like the most eligible bachelor of B-town found himself a date on the eve of   there. 

 Jacqueline took to her   account to share a video where Salman can be seen revealing his date for the love day. 
 
 Jacqueline captioned the post as, "Happy Valentines Day everyone 💋💋 all the single ladies put your hands up!!! @beingsalmankhan new date revealed ❤️"
 
  
  
 In the video, Salman starts up by saying that he is very happy because he finally has Valentine's Day date. While Jacky thinks it might probably be her, the   star ends up showing a 'date fruit' as his date. 
 
 While the actress is left disappointed with his answers, Salman casually eats the date fruit with a grin on his face!
