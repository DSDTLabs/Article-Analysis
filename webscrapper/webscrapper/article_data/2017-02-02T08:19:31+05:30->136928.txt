I never raised him up in this manner. Since his father passed away 25 years ago, I have worked hard to ensure he gets a better life.

 I still cannot believe he has committed such a shameful crime. But he is still my son. I cannot disown him.
 
 He has a wife and a little son. The boy is only six years old. Since I am a woman, I can completely understand what the young girl must have gone through.
 
 I am sorry for my son's deeds and I pray with folded hands to her to forgive him. I will ensure he never commits such a crime ever again.
