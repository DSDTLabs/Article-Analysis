PUNE: To push forward land acquisition process for MIDC-Ranjangaon Phase III, the state government on Friday agreed to pay a compensation of Rs 1 crore per hectare to farmers for acquisition of 100 hectares of land in the area.

 With several investors keen on investing in   area, the completion of land acquisition process will make way for several investments in Pune district, stated   officials
 
 “The expansion of Ranjangaon Phase III was pending for the last several years with farmers opposing land acquisition and quoting Rs 1.58 crore per hectare. On Friday, after several discussions, Rs 1 crore per hectare was agreed upon by   (MIDC) and farmers,’’ stated Pune district collector  .
 
 Nearly 500 proposals are pending with MIDC for want of land in the state and Pune is a prime area for investments, stated MIDC officials.
 
 Severe resistance from farmers had delayed the project.
 
 During the meeting on Friday, MIDC officials initially resisted the farmers’ demands saying that they would have to develop the land before usage, which would cost them Rs 80 lakh per hectare and giving them Rs 1.58 crore per hectare was not possible.
 
 The meeting was convened by the chief minister in the presence of additional chief secretary, industries, Pune district collectors and MLA   and farmers’ representatives.
 
 Members from the industrial association have stated that phase I and Phase II already have 300 industries and phase III will bring in more investments in the district
 
 A host of investments had been announced during the recent Magnetic Maharashtra Summit, however, cost of land and opposition from farmers have delayed investments coming into the district.
 
 This year, of the 4,106 MoUs signed during the recently concluded ‘Magnetic Maharashstra: Convergence Summit’, 278 MoUs worth Rs 5,233 crore have been proposed in various industrial estates in Pune district.
