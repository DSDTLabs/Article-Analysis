Tirupur: The dollar city may be the knitwear capital of the country and may manufacture textile products to various leading global brands. But only a few companies here have succeeded in reaching to customers directly, that is in business to consumer-b2c market.

 This might soon change as Amazon.com Inc, the world’s largest e-commerce company, would provide its platform for Tirupur knitwear manufacturers to promote their brands and reach customers. 
 
 “Only big players who could afford the cost of networking were able to promote their own brands. But with the help of e-commerce companies, even small manufacturers could promote their goods. The partnership with Amazon, and also Flipkart, another e-commerce player who earlier had approached us, would provide equal ground to all manufacturers to grow in b2c market,” Tirupur exporters’ association president Raja M Shanmugham told TOI.
 
 “Amazon has witnessed huge interest across the world for apparel and other textile goods from Tirupur. We see huge potential for small and medium enterprises to scale up their export through b2c e-commerce channel across categories like T-shirts, dresses other consumer textile products,” said Abhijit Kamra, head - global selling, Amazon India.
 
 Keeping this in mind, Amazon and FICCI-CMSME (confederation of micro, small and medium enterprises) have conducted a workshop for the apparel exporters in the city on Wednesday. 
 
 “Amazon teams would help exporters and manufactures to familiarise with the demand patterns in various countries and to launch products in accordance with local tastes,” said Abhijit Kamra
 
 Emphasising the importance of tapping the opportunity, Prabhu Dhamodharan, secretary of Indian Texpreneurs Federation, said “With e-commerce projected to attain overwhelming growth, the apparel manufacturers should transform themselves to b2c market with the help of players like Amazon, who could solve the biggest challenge of providing logistics services.”
