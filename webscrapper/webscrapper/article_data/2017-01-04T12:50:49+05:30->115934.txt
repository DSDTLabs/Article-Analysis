VADODARA: The   on Tuesday stayed the reinstatement of royal scion   as the president of Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) till January 10. 

 The BCA had challenged the charity commissioner’s order reinstating him, hearing on which was held on Tuesday.
 
 While BCA told the court that Gaekwad was anyway ineligible for the president post as he has been an officebearer for over nine years as per Lodha Committee recommendations, his advocate argued that the maximum nine-year term rule doesn‘t apply to the affiliated state cricket associations.
 
 Gaekwad, who was elected as Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) president in 2013, was removed from his post during an AGM last year. Gaekwad has challenged his removal, hearing for which was held in the high court on Tuesday. 
 
 The high court stayed the charity commissioner’s order of continuing Gaekwad as BCA president and kept the next hearing on January 10. The court has asked both sides to maintain status quo till then. 
 
 “We told the court that all recommendations of the Lodha Committee accepted by   will be applicable to the state cricket associations except the maximum nine-year term rule. The SC order mentions the maximum of nine years term for only BCCI and not the cricket associations,” said Devesh Patel, Gaekwad’s advocate .
 
 When contacted, Gaekwad said that he will wait for the court order and its interpretation. “My focus right now is on BCA’s presidency for which I am engaged in a legal battle. I was wrongly removed from BCA president’s post and it is a different case from the SC order on Lodha committee.”
 
 Snehal Parikh, BCA’s in-charge secretary, said, “The court will also hear arguments for the nine-year term applicability to state associations on January 10. Our lawyers argued that the rule applies to all BCCI-affiliated state cricket associations. We also pointed out that many officials from other state associations have resigned due to this rule.”
