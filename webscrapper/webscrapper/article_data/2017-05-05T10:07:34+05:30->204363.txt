AHMEDABAD: The main accused in Rs 5,395-crore hawala scam, Afroz  , was exonerated of charges of criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating from the FIR filed against him by Surat crime branch in 2011.

 On basis of this FIR, the   (ED) had begun a probe into money laundering charges and busted the hawala scam, involving more than 90 persons and firms across the country.
 
  high court on Wednesday quashed the criminal proceedings under provisions of the Indian Penal Code by the trial court in Surat against Hasanfatta, on the grounds that the court did proceeded without proper application of mind on the basis of a chargesheet filed by Surat police in 2014.
 
  Justice   was of the opinion that the FIR and chargesheet did not have any tangible evidence, and Hasanfatta was implicated only on grounds of conspiracy. The court said there was nothing in the chargesheet to even remotely suggest Hasanfatta’s role in the swindling of Rs 16 crore by setting up foreign companies who were recipient of sums fraudulently sent abroad or in any such remittances in India.
 
 The   said, “There is no tangible admissible evidence which can prima facie make out or satisfy the basic ingredients of the offences alleged under Sections 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 477-A and 120-B of IPC, sufficient enough to even subject the petitioner to any trial on basis thereof.”
 
 The court observed that Hasanfatta was implicated in the case only on the basis of hearsay, and there is no material evidence either direct or circumstantial against him. “It is a matter of record that neither any of the cheque discounters or the angadias, who are named as witnesses for having received huge cash amounts and for making RTGS payments against such cash receipts to various firms/companies which were ultimately used for effecting the outward foreign remittances from the accounts of Indian entities, have levelled any accusations against the petitioner, nor has any such angadia/cheque discounter shown even any acquaintance much less transactions in the relevant period with the petitioner, which can be considered as sufficient enough to subject the petitioner to rigours of trial, the HC said.
