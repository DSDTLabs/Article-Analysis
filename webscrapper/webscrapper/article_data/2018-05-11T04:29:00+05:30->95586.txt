Ahmedabad: Amid the cheering and celebrations that followed declaration of class XII science stream results of Gujarat board, students were already thinking of their next step — that of applying to courses of their choice in higher studies. Most who opted for group ‘A’ (physics, chemistry, mathematics) seemed keen to pursue computer engineering and information technology, while those from group ‘B’ (physics, chemistry, biology) said practice of medicine was their preferred career choice.

 
 “I want to pursue a career in artificial intelligence. For this, I will need a strong base in information technology and therefore, I hope I get admission in a good institute,” said Rohan Jasani of MK School at GLS Campus, who scored 99.83 percentile.
 
 Some were sure of their career choices right from class X and had worked with a single-minded focus. “I completely shunned using a phone or even social media for three years, ever since I got into class X. Regular meditation helped me focus. I hope I get into a good engineering institute, as I wish to pursue computer science in engineering,” said Varshil Shah, a student of MK Secondary School at the GLS campus in Law Garden area of Ahmedabad.
 
 Most students who were from group ‘B’ wanted to become a doctor or pharmacist. “My results have been somewhat less than what I expected, but I’m still very happy that my efforts have paid off. My parents have encouraged me to work hard. I hope to get admission into a good institute for pharmacy,” said Moxa Parekh, a student of Sharda Mandir School in Paldi.
