HUBBALLI: The conventional way of wooing voters like holding meetings and approaching voters at their door steps appears to have become a thing of past now. The   constituency is one of the high profile constituencies in   district since former chief minister Jagadish   has been winning from here since 1992. Now, all parties including independents and   are doing their best to stop Shettar from winning another term. 

 Scientist turn activist  , who is contesting on AAP ticket from the constituency, is conducting a unique campaign . He is relying on Facebook and other modern publicity strategies to woo voters. He is the first candidate in the constituency to have used a flash mob in a campaign.
 
 This apart, he is also visiting a specific place in the constituency which has been neglected like road, lake, etc. He is uploading videos of that area with a narration spelling out why that place in in a bad shape while also giving facts on his   accounts to highlight the failure of Shettar.
 
 Santosh told TOI, "I have done a lot of research about the constituency and about the status of basic infrastructure and the burning issues before taking the plunge in to the election. Now, I found that flash mobs and uploading videos on social media to draw the attention of people towards the sorry state of central constituency as very effective tools. All youths of AAP are participating in the flash mob events with new songs and music. We play Hindi and Kannada chartbusters along with two AAP theme songs."
 
 "During a flash mob, I interact with those present to explain how Shettar has failed to develop the constituency in the last two decades. My efforts to rely on flash mobs has paid off as a large number of people are gathering there while many are responding to my videos on Facebook," said Santosh.
 
 "I am now planning to hold street plays and utilize Facebook live to have a direct chat with voters of my constituency," he said.
