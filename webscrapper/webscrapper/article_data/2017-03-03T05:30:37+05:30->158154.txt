AHMEDABAD: Was Ahmedabad also a target of the   along with Rajkot, Bhavnagar and the temple in Chotila? The   (ATS) is now tracking details of nine people — five from Rajkot and four from Ahmedabad — who had chatted online with   Waseem and his brother  . 

 ATS officials said that apart from the nine people in Gujarat, a few chat IDs from other states are also under scanner. “Police from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan have already arrived in the city and are jointly interrogating the ISIS suspects,” said an ATS official.
 
 Sources said that during the forensic examination of the cell phone and laptop of Waseem, nine chat IDs were traced to Rajkot and Ahmedabad. 
 
 “They have not indulged in any terror activity so far,” a senior ATS official said. “But for for about a year, they had been chatting about ISIS terror attacks across the globe and discussing the idea of Caliphate on end-to-end encrypted social media platforms.” The official further said that the police have an option of “de-radicalization such misguided youths”. 
 
 ATS officials said they are trying to retrieve their whole chat history to know whether Ramodiya brothers were planning an attack on Ahmedabad or any other city of Gujarat.
 
 “We have also been able to retrieve some user IDs which have been traced to foreign countries such as Iraq and Syria. The user IDs are suspected to be operated from foreign shores and could be of ISIS terror operatives,” said an ATS official.
