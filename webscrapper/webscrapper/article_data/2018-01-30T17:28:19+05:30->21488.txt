PATNA: The film  , which created an uproar at several places in the country, is being screened in Bihar either with the posters having old name, ‘Padmaavati’, or with no posters at all! The film’s name was changed following the Central Board of Film Certification’ advice. 

 Posters with old name of the movie have been displayed at several theatres across the state as they either did not receive new posters from the distributors or avoided displaying it fearing vandalism and protests. Dr Sunil Kumar, the   MLA from Biharsharif in Nalanda district, is the distributor of the film in Bihar.
 
 Manager of a cinema hall in Patna, Sharad Gupta, said they have received the posters with new name of the movie for replacement, but avoided display them fearing vandalism and protest. “The distributor must have received posters from producers, but it might be the theatre owners who have not shown interest in displaying them. We did not take the risk of displaying any poster at all,” said Gupta, whose theatre started screening the film only from Monday under heavy police deployment. He said the posters are supplied by the film producers, who also decide which shot is to be displayed. 
 
 Abhishek Nirala, manager of a city multiplex which also started screening the movie on Monday, said they also decided not to display even a single poster of the movie fearing backlash. “We will start displaying them within a couple of days,” he said.
 
 The MLA could not be contacted despite several calls made to his cellphone number. The staff at his Exhibition Road office also refused to discuss the issue.
