NEW DELHI:   at a   station stole all the money and passport of a   national who had come to the capital. Police, however, caught the thieves within 24 hours and   an all-women gang in the process. 

 T Sukumaran had 8,300 dollars apart from his travel and stay documents with him. On May 8, he took the Metro from Karol Bagh to  . While reaching for the token to exit, Sukumaran realised that his wallet was missing from his bag. 
 
 Sukumaran straightaway went to the   police station and lodged an FIR. Since he had no money to pay for his bills, police took up his case on priority. 
 
 The first thing to do was scan CCTV footage at different stations. A team led by ASI Dalbir Singh then spotted a group of   moving around in a suspicious manner. Traps were laid to nab them, but it was an informer who tipped off the police about their exact whereabouts. 
 
 During interrogation, the women—all of them from Shadipur—told the police about their modus operandi. Every morning, they would board trains from different stations and meet at a common point like Rajiv Chowk or Mandi House. They would always travel in a group during peak hours and carry out thefts. This was done to ensure that if one of them was caught, the others would act as common passengers and help their accomplice escape. 
 
 They said they had committed a number of thefts recently, and mostly targeted foreigners and women. Police recovered Sukumaran’s money intact and another 60 dollars, the source of which they don’t know yet. Police are also trying to find out if there are others in the gang. 
 
 DCP (Metro)   said the women have been sent to Tihar Jail on judicial custody.
