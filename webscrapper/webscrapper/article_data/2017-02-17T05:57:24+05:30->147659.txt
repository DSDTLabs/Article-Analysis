PANAJI: Congress spokespersons Avinash Tavares and Swati Kerkar said the   investigation of the Vasco minor rape case was deliberately botched up the   and blamed the   for not solving the case. After probing the case for almost four years, the CBI failed to trace or identify the accused and approached the Vasco judicial magistrate first class, seeking permission to close the case.

  “The Congress will pursue the case if it comes to power,” said Tavares. On January 14, 2013, a seven-year-old girl was raped in the toilet of her school and during the course of the investigation the CBI interrogated 391 suspects, sources said.
 
  “The investigation failed at the local police level. The government has to take responsibility for this,” said Tavares. Pointing out that the incident took place at a prestigious school, Kerkar said, “If the police cannot solve this case, then what about those that happen is smaller or rural schools?”
