BhHUBANESWAR: The city may have been accorded a  , but its   paths are anything but smart. The footpaths here have virtually turned into  , forcing pedestrians to use crowded roads risking their lives. 

 Several four-wheelers are seen parked on the pedestrian paths. This is a norm rather than exception in various parts of the city. Though the   (BMC) took up a drive to clear the footpaths of vehicular parking, the impact is not visible at all.
 
 Be it the crowded stretch between Jayadev Vihar and KIIT square, AG square and Raj Mahal, Master Canteen and Vani Vihar, cars and bikes remain parked there. The two-wheeler riders use footpaths, causing serious inconvenience to commuters. Adding to the mess is the mushrooming makeshift eateries. 
 
 Binay Panigrahi, a telecom professional, said, "One will think twice before putting his feet on the footpaths. One never knows whether he will be hit by a speeding motorcycle rushing from the opposite direction." 
 
 The walkers have to give way to the motorists for fear of being hit. The cars are even parked on narrow lanes. "One is forced to use the roads with heavy traffic to walk," said a resident Ashok Kumar Singh.
 
 There are also several obstructions such as signages and display boards put up by the shops on the pedestrian paths. A recent survey by Local Governance Network, a private body, revealed that pedestrian paths here are mostly being used for vehicle parking.
 
 The survey was conducted by taking opinions of 217 commuters, most of whom were pedestrians. Significantly, 77% respondents felt that the city roads were not safe for the pedestrians. People said they have are forced to use scooters or bikes to cover small distance.
 
 "We have been receiving complaints of people using footpaths for parking vehicles. A new squad will be formed to remove the vehicles recklessly parked on the paths meant for walkers,"said city mayor Anant Narayan Jena.
