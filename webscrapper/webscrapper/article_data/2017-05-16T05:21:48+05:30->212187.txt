 It has also suggested the government provide free charging facility for the first three years to attract potential vehicle buyers.
 
 The report comes at a time when the government is working on a policy for electric vehicles. “It will be announced by the year end. The aim is to reduce air pollution and our dependence on import of crude oil,” Union transport minister   said on Monday. He added that a number of Indian companies have shown keen interest to invest in electric vehicles and related infrastructure.
 
 Sources said the policy will specify the nodal agency that will be responsible for the initiative. The government’s assurance for bulk purchase will create a favourable condition for industries to pump in funds for setting up facilities, a senior government functionary said.

 Non-availability of charging facility has been identified as one of the main deterrents for people to opt for electric vehicles.
