When you spend weeks away from home, you make your temporary abode your own.   did just that while shooting ' '. The actress, who plays the leading lady in Dinesh Vijan’s romantic outing, left India 15 days before the shoot to begin prep in   where the film has extensively been shot. While she completed her workshops by the day, the evenings and days off were spent exploring the Hungarian capital. While moving around town, the actress picked up a few basic sentences and words spoken by the locals. That, we hear, came in handy, whenever she headed out for a meal at a city eatery or for shopping at the local markets. Even though it has been several months since the shoot wrapped up, Kriti remembers everything she learnt during her stay in   and doesn’t mind teaching it to whoever wants to learn.
