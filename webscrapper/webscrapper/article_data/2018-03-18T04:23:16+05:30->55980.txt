KOCHI: At a seminar on ‘The Challenges Faced by Democracy’ here on Saturday, former   Justice   highlighted the case of Justice KM Joseph, former chief justice of Uttarakhand, who was not elevated to the SC allegedly because he quashed President’s Rule in the state and antagonised the powers that be.

 “The message the Union government is trying to convey is they would object to anybody who opposes the political ideology propagated by it,” Justice Joseph said. He also referred to the case of Justice  , who quit as a Karnataka HC judge following his transfer to Allahabad HC when he was tipped for elevation; the transfer would have reduced him to puisne (junior) judge. 
 
 Justice Patel had directed a   investigation into the   fake encounter when he was chief justice of Gujarat HC. Senior SC advocate  , in his keynote address, said corruption affected the pillars of democracy.
