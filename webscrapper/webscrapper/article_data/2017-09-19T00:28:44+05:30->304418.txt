MUMBAI: A couple and their three children, including an infant, allegedly consumed a chemical used to clean  , at their   home in the wee hours of Monday. While the man and his seven-year-old daughter were declared dead, his wife and two daughters, aged three years and six months, are in hospital. The couple’s two sons, aged eight and nine, survived the suicide bid as they were in another house with their grandfather.

 Tuling police said the incident came to light on Monday at around 7.30am when Jitendra Singh came to drop his grandsons at his son Manish Singh’s (30) home in Jagannath Building at Pragati Nagar, Nalasopara (East). Manish and his daughter Pragati (7) were found dead while his wife Pinky (29) and daughters Pratiksha (3) and Bitty (6 months) were unconscious. They were taken to the civic hospital where doctors said they probably have consumed a chemical used to polish imitation jewellery.
 
 Tuling inspector Kishore Khairnar said a suicide note written by Manish was found in the house. It stated he and his family were taking their lives by consuming poison. Khairnar said the note did not mention the reason for taking the extreme step. Manish, who had an imitation jewellery business, is believed to have suffered losses. Family members told police he was unable to repay his mounting debts.
 
 Police are waiting to record Pinky’s statement. The daughters are believed to have been forced to drink the liquid before the couple consumed it. While Pinky is under dialysis, Pratiksha and Bitty are under observation and out of danger.
 
 The family lived in the rented apartment for the past few years. Police will also record the statement of Jitendra. It is not clear if Manish intentionally sent his sons with their grandfather while the couple consumed poison with their daughters.
