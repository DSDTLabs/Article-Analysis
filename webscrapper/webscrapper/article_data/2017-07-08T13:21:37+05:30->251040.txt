SURAT: Textile Yuva Brigade (TYB) has decided to provide free food kits to daily wagers rendered jobless due to the indefinite strike in the textile markets here. 

 With over 75,000 textile shops in 165 textile markets shut for the last one week, over 2.5 lakh daily wagers have been rendered jobless. The daily wagers include tempo drivers, labourers who lift fabric parcels, security personnel, box and cartoon packers, etc. 
 
 The TYB members met on Friday and unanimously decided to provide food kits to the daily wagers for the survival of their families. 
 
 Lalit  , a member of TYB, told  , “Over 2.5 lakh daily wagers in the textile markets have been rendered jobless in past one week due to the ongoing strike in the markets. The TYB supports the indefinite strike, but at the same time we are concerned about our daily wagers as well. Thus, we have decided to provide them with food kits, so that they can cook food and feed their families.”
 
 Sharma added, “We will start the supply of the food kits from July 10. For this, we have urged the textile traders’ community to donate funds to take up this mammoth job of reaching out to the daily wagers in the textile markets here.”
