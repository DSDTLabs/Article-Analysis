PATNA: Along with   and the  , also blotted out of Nitish Kumar’s book after his restored alliance with the BJP is his political strategist in the last assembly election,  .

 Widely, even if somewhat exaggeratedly, considered instrumental in Nitish’s strategy in the 2015   assembly polls, Kishor had, as a matter of fact, first shot into prominence as the “election strategist” of Prime Minister   in 2014.
 
 Sources close to Kishor said on Sunday that he has told Nitish about his inability to continue as the CM’s adviser. In political circles in Bihar’s capital, Kishor’s decision to quit is being attributed to the BJP-JD(U) alliance. 
 
 Sources in the CM’s office said they had information about Kishor’s unavailability for his official engagements in Bihar. He has cabinet rank in the state government.
 
 “Ever since the Bihar Vikas Mission was formed in January last year, he attended only one meeting and that too for 10 minutes,” said a source, adding, “Now, when the JD(U) is in alliance with the BJP, there was no way he could have continued.”
 
 The source said, “Both he and the CM have very good relations, which has nothing to do with political alignment or financial benefit.” Currently, Kishor is in Andhra Pradesh to help   with his political plans.
