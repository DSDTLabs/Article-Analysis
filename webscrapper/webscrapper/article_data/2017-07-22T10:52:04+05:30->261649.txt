 will not be returning to her role as Enchantress in the sequel of 2016 hit movie 'Suicide Squad'. 

  
  
 The supermodel-and-actress, who played Dr June Moone - aka Enchantress in the DC Comic movie, says she will not be reprising the role because she thinks the character has run its course for now. "It was a life-changing experience, and of course I'd do another one, but I don't think it would make sense for the character," Delevingne said. 
 
 However, the 24 year old star, who is famous for having boundless energy on set and pranking her co-stars, will not let that stop her from spending time with her old cast. "I'll probably still be on the set hanging out with everyone," she said. 
 
 The DC Comic movie also featured  ,  ,  , Joel Kinnaman,  , Jai Courtney,  , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Karen Fukuhara.
