 girl  , who rose to fame after making it to the finale of the television reality show Bigg Boss Kannada Season 5, has added another feather to her cap by becoming the Mysuru district youth icon of Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation, to create awareness on   in the run-up to the   State elections to be held on May 12. A video of Niveditha talking about why everyone should vote has been released online.

 About being the youth icon, she says, “I am glad that I will be using the Bigg Boss fame for the betterment of society by requesting people to vote, which is the duty of the every citizen in a democratic country. Each vote can take our country or state farther on the path of development. It is only once in five years that we get an opportunity to voice our opinions with our vote. I request people to vote gleefully without fretting over it. There might be serpentine queues that may take you a long time to vote, or there could be technical glitches, but we need to brave it to see the future we have envisioned. It is the only time we can have a say in the kind of government we would like to see, so we need to stamp our authority by voting in large numbers.” Niveditha, who will be voting for the first time, adds, “As a child, I always wanted to have that indelible ink on my finger, which I will be getting on May 12, but at the same time, there is lot of responsibility as we need to elect people who will protect our interest over the next five years.”
