 Hamidreza Zare from Marvdasht in Iran and nine other students were admitted for BDS course for the academic year of 2016 -2021. Their course began in September 2016. In a petition submitted to SP Pa Moorthy on Tuesday, they said the college authorities demanded them to pay the admission and course fee of Rs 2,00,45,500, which they did. 
 
 Meanwhile, they received a letter from the registrar of Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University, Chennai on November 19, 2016. “The letter stated that we were discharged from the course. When we enquired about the communication, we were informed to continue the course without any disturbance and the private college management would challenge the discharge letter before the court and it will be sorted out within two months. We were preparing for examination and suddenly we were asked not to attend the class from April 2017,” said Hamidreza Zare.
 
 Following this, the students demanded the college management to refund their fee amount and the college too promised to refund. “We repeatedly requested the college management to refund our amount. However, now we came to know that the management is not ready to give back and we are forced to go to our country without any money,” he added.
 
 When contacted, college authorities said that as per   criteria, foreign nationals don’t need to appear for Neet. But based on the apex court order, the Dental Council of India is pressurising colleges to admit the students who had taken Neet. The private college managements challenged in the apex court and the final hearing will come up on August 11. Based on the court’s order, the college management will act.
