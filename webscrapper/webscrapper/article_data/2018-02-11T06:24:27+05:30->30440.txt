PUNE: A 19-year-old caregiver was arrested on Saturday night in connection with the murder of   (65), wife of Marathi theatre and film director   (72). The motive of the murder is yet to be ascertained. But police suspect that the arrested youth, Kisan   of  , killed   in a fit of rage. 

 A senior police officer told TOI that Munde might have been angry with Deepali. "He may have assaulted and throttled her. He may have created a fire-like situation in the kitchen to divert the probe process," the officer said. 
 
 Deepali (65) was found murdered in the kitchen of her Pune home on Thursday. "It is suspected the caregiver may have killed Deepali by throttling and beating her up, before setting her ablaze in the kitchen. We have strong reason to believe he is the one who killed her," deputy commissioner of police Basavraj Teli told TOI. 
 
 Two male caregivers were employed by the   to look after Dilip Kolhatkar, bedridden for the past three years. Three days ago, Munde, pursuing BA at a college in Pune, started working at the house in lieu of one of the caretakers, who had gone on leave. "He had left the Kolhatkars' residence late on Thursday evening," said senior inspector   Salunkhe.
 
 Deepali was murdered between 7.32pm and 7.52pm on Thursday, Salunkhe said. "Prima facie, theft or robbery has been ruled out as nothing was stolen from the house. Even the jewellery on Deepali was intact," she said.
 
 According to the post-mortem report, there were injury marks on Deepali's head. The report stated that she was throttled, beaten up and also had burn injuries.
 
 The last rites were performed in Pune on Saturday.
