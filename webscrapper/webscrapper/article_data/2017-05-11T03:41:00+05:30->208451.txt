Mapusa:   and pork stall owners from the Mapusa market have been asked to operate from the mutton stalls, which were lying vacant in the same building as the mutton stall owners shifted to the fish market complex, as a temporary measure after the structure was deemed unsafe. 

 The owners of the beef and pork stalls were in a precarious condition after the foundation of the building was exposed.
 
 The council has assured the stall owners that temporary structures will be ready by June 10, opposite the fish market.
 
  The Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) on Monday had served notices to 16 beef and pork stall owners from mutton market in Mapusa, directing them to vacate the stalls within three days as the structure was unsafe. Sources said that because of the ongoing work of the main nullah at the back of the mutton and beef market, part of the retaining wall had collapsed exposing the foundation of the building.
