PANAJI: The state forest department is contemplating setting up a walk-in aviary within the premises of the state’s only zoological park housed inside the   wildlife sanctuary. This comes even as plans are on the cards to renovate the entire zoo.

 “We have a number of birds at Bondla like pheasants, parakeets. But we don’t have a walk-in aviary for visitors. We can have a big walk-in zoo where one can roam around while the birds are moving freely. Within a zoo section, we can have an aviary section,” said Ajai  , principal chief conservator of forests. Sources said that the proposed aviary will have two separate wings for wetland and terrestrial birds.
 
 Goa has over 400 avian species, of which at least 200 have reportedly been sighted at the sanctuary. Also, a few terrestrial birds like the peacock are already housed at the existing zoo.
 
 “At the proposed avi-zoo, terrestrial birds will only require a cage, but for wetland birds, forest officials will have to create artificial waterholes inside the sanctuary because such birds swim and stay in the water. The present cages of terrestrial birds will be shifted to the new location meant especially for birds. The cages here will be bigger and so will the display area,” sources said.
 
 The aviary will be deisgned as per the specifications of the central zoo authorities ( ), the nitty-gritties of which the department is in the process of working out. 
 
 “We’re working on a masterplan for the entire zoo. Once that is ready, it has to be approved by the CZA and only then, we can construct an aviary inside it,” Saxena said.
