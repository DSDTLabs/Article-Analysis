Call   and   if relationship advice is what you are after. ' ' stars are no less than Love Gurus when it comes to dispensing advice on love and relationships. The actors have some serious tips and tricks up their sleeves for their fans this Valentine's Day. 

 'Watch a horror movie with your girl,' says Alia. 'She'd be scared and will hold your hand through the film,' she adds. The actress also believes that 'if you fake it, the girl will see through it'. Being on the phone during a date, is a deal-breaker for the lady, 'don't be on the phone when you are together,' she says. And the most important piece of advice from the lady is 'Do NOT over do the I Love You's.' Fair enough! 
  
 Her co-star   Dhawan believes in old school romance. He suggests ditching the texting and messaging for a day and sending out a 'hand written letter instead.' Since he is big on movies, he recommends that you take your man for his favourite movie. 'Or give him his favourite Play Station game,' he says adding 'girls have a habit of taking too many pictures, do not do that, and don't constantly keep talking to your girl pals on the phone and definitely don't ask them to join you while you are on a date.'
