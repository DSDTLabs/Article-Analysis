COIMBATORE: MLAs who do not want salary hike, can provide their increased salary amount to the Chief Minister’s relief fund, said municipal administration minister SP   as he came down on DMK for politicising the issue.

 “MLAs told us that they were not able to function properly as they were getting a meagre salary. They requested the government to increase the salary. Their demands are fulfilled. The government has to spend Rs 25 crore per annum for this,” he said. 
 
 Velumani also promised to provide new potable water connections the city residents from January 14. "The city corporation stopped potable water supply connections to houses due to severe drought. Now the situation has improved and we will provide new water connections from Sunday. We have instructed the officials not to dig up roads for providing new water connections. The corporation won't also increase potable water charges,” he said.\
 
 The minister also warned to cancel the licences of the contractors who dig up roads for drinking water connection. Velumani said this after conducting a review meeting with bank and corporation officials at the district collectorate here on Friday evening. 
 
 Addressing the reporters, he said he has discussed the issue of providing loans for students, entrepreneurs and self-help groups with the bank officials. He said special camps will be conducted at union levels in the district to provide loans.
