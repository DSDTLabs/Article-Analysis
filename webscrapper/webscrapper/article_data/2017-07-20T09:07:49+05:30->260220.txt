KOCHI: Pressure is mounting on chief minister   to defuse the crisis in the health sector following the strike threat from nurses and all major hospitals discharging patients and postponing elective surgeries.

 The nurses’ unions have issued a notice to hospitals stating that they will stop work from Friday if the talks with the CM fail. The letter said they would go on mass casual leave on Thursday in view of the failure of talks called by the high court-appointed mediators.
 
 Majority hospitals have scaled down operations. “Services will be affected as we can’t risk admitting patients when the nurses are not there. Some hospitals have restricted new admissions and are discharging patients who are stable. Those who need advanced care are being referred to the government hospital,”  ' Association president Dr PK Mohamed Rasheed said.
