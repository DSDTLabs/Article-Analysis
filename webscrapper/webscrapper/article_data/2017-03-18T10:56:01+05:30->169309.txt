NAINITAL: The tiger which killed two people in the   forest range of Ramnagar division on Thursday found dead under mysterious circumstances in Nainital zoo. The  , however, suggests the feline died of internal injuries, septicemia and asphyxiation.

 The tiger had dragged away two people — a woman and her relative who had attempted to rescue her — early on Thursday. A few hours later, in the evening, it was captured by forest officials. The death of the big cat makes it the fifth recorded death of a tiger in the hill state this year.
 
  circle forest conservator   told TOI, “Other than injuries, the post-mortem report indicated that the tiger’s stomach was empty for more than 15 days. Besides, due to territorial infighting, his claws of forelimbs were found damaged, which prompted attacks on humans.”
 
 Forest officials told TOI that a total six tigers, five males and one female, were spotted in 20-km radius of Ramnagar and Terai West forest divisions at the beginning of this year.
 
 “With the mating season going on, infighting might have taken place among tigers for the possession of a female,” said the officials, adding: “Injury marks inflicted by claws over the body of the   and teeth marks around his neck and forelimbs too ascertain it”.
