Visakhapatnam: In a first-of-its-kind initiative to promote marine products, a   was opened by a fisherwomen collective from Mangamaripeta in the district on Saturday. Developed at a cost of Rs 15.5 lakh, the fish nutri cart is being run by Small Scale Fisheries Producer Company Limited comprising fisherwomen from Mangamaripeta and will be stationed on Beach Road in the coming days.

 The fish nutri cart will have a variety of marine products available including mackerel, shrimp, shear fish and anchovies during the initial days following which the fisherwomen are planning to introduce other products such as fish cutlets and pickles. While the district collector has sanctioned Rs 10 lakh for the project, the Fisherfolk Foundation contributed Rs 5.5 lakh for developing the fish nutri cart. Speaking to TOI, Arjilli Dasu of Fisherfolk Foundation said, “Six women will be running the fish nutri cart and everyday it will be open from 2.30 pm to around 9.30 pm near Beach Road. We are initially looking to serve fish fry products along with prawn pakoda and fish kurkure to customers. Later on we will be expanding on the products.”
 
 “The fisherwomen from Mangamaripeta had earlier participated in the Visakha Utsav following which the district collector sanctioned this project,” he said.
