RANCHI: Ranchi and the whole state received drizzles to light thundershowers on Tuesday early morning. 

 Cloud cover prevailed across most parts of the state throughout the day and brought down the daytime temperature two degrees below the normal. 
 
 The Ranchi observatory of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed the overcast conditions to the impact of western disturbances persisting over the northwestern India. 
 
 In its evening weather bulletin, IMD Ranchi stated that the conditions will prevail across the state till Wednesday afternoon. "Clear skies will bring down the minimum temperature by at least three degrees on Wednesday night," Binay Mondal, chief weather scientist at Ranchi IMD said. 
 
 Ranchi recorded 0.2 mm rainfall till 5:30 pm on Tuesday while Jamshedpur recorded trace rainfall. Fog prevailed in northeastern Jharkhand in the morning. Visibility was reduced to less than 500 m in Daltonganj, the IMD said. However, no weather warnings were issued. 
 
 Ranchi recorded 17.5째 C in the afternoon while minimum temperature was recorded at 13.6째C in early morning on Tuesday. Jamshedpur recorded a minimum of 14.2째 C while Daltonganj recorded 14.5째 C.
 
 Weather scientists stated that one upper air circulation formed over north Madhya Pradesh and another in the sub-Himalayan West Bengal.
 
  "The western disturbances had moved further northeastwards overnight, as a result of which, heavy cloud cover formed over these states," Mondal said.
 
 The Ranchi weather office predicted that two more western disturbances can form in northern India in the next two weeks. 
 
 The western disturbances can lead to a wet spell in Jharkhand during this time, Mondal said. 
 
 The weathermen on Tuesday predicted clear skies and dry atmosphere in the next 48 hours. Clearer skies will lead to rise in daytime temperatures and cause a sharp fall at night. Cold breezes blowing in from the west are expected to contribute to the chilling factor.
