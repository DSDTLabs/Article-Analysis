Pune: At the age of 17, Omkar Dhamane exhibits an extraordinary grit.

 Despite being wheelchair-bound since birth and losing his father just 20 days before the exams, Omkar prevailed over all the odds to score 72.8% in Class X exams, results of which were announced on Tuesday.
 
 The boy, who suffers from spastic diplegia (a form of cerebral palsy), originally hails from Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. Just weeks before his exams, his father, an army man posted in Srinagar, started having medical trouble. “He was admitted to Command Hospital in Pune where his condition deteriorated and he passed away on February 16,” Manisha, Omkar’s mother, told TOI.
 
 After the results were declared, Omkar could not hold back his emotions and wished his father was there to see him excel. “He was very particular about my studies. I had studied hard to score above 80%. However, my father’s passing away took a huge toll on me,” Omkar said.
 
 After his father died, Omkar couldn’t concentrate on his studies. “We went back to Ahmednagar after my husband’s passing away and returned only during the exam period. He is a hardworking kid. Now, we will enroll him at a junior college in Ahmednagar,” Manisha said.
 
 About the road ahead, Omkar wishes to become a software engineer. “I always had a thing for computers,” he said, adding that his friends and teachers helped him a lot during the turbulent times.
 
 Arti Sharma, principal of APS Kirkee from where Omkar cleared his Class X, said, “We had changed all his classes to ground floor to ensure he did not any trouble. His friends always stood by his side and helped him sail through the turbulent times.”
