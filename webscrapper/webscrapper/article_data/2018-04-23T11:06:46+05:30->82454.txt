CHANDIGARH: With the term of the present association of resident doctors ( ) in   coming to an end, the doctors are planning to gear up for elections after their postgraduate exams this month. There are around 1,200 resident doctors on the PGI campus.

 The present ARD is headed by Dr   from the dental sciences department. However, most of the resident doctors are not satisfied with the unfulfilled promises made by the ARD. “We would like to include doctors from the core specialisations rather than community medicine and dental sciences. Those in the core, understand the problems and can work accordingly to resolve them,” said a resident doctor.
 
 There was a demand of resident doctors’ lounge on the lines of the faculty lounge in the  , but no ARD has been able to meet it. Also, the emergency has remained congested and there has been no relaxation in the timings of the resident doctors, who are posted more than 15 hours there.
 
 Recently, a resident doctor had committed suicide in the hostel. Thereafter, the resident doctors demanded for counselling too. “The issue should have been taken seriously and the ARD should have recommended regular communication with the juniors who are unable to adjust,” said another resident doctor.
 
 “Once the exams are over, we will get into election mode. We want those who can voice our issues to the concerned officials,” said a junior resident doctor.
