New Delhi: Asking nine JNU students to   on the next hearing “without fail”, a Delhi court on Thursday dismissed their plea stating that there is no law that allows a magistrate court to either direct or to record consent or refusal for conducting a lie-detector test.

 The students will now have to appear and either give or refuse their consent to undergo a lie-detector test in connection with the case of missing student  . All the nine students had challenged police summons for polygraph test. Counsel for the students Vishwa Bhushan Arya had earlier argued, “There is no provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure whereby the court of magistrate may direct anyone to undergo lie detector test.”
 
 Chief metropolitan magistrate ( ) Sumit Dass, however, said that to assert that it is “up to one’s sweet wish or will to record the consent as and when he feels, otherwise it would amount to coercion, is a completely untenable argument”.
 
 “Lie detector test or polygraph test has to be obviously in reference to the need or requirement in the investigation. Same is the prerogative of the investigating agency,” the court observed. 
 
 The court was hearing a plea where the students had sought clarification in the court's order over recording of consent or refusal of the students for conducting lie detector test. The students have argued that the test is “highly unwarranted and illegal”. The lawyer cited the guidelines of the   which state that a lie detector test is not authorised by law. The CMM, in his order, said that the situations in the guidelines are not absolute, but illustrative.
 
 The CMM court will now hear the matter on April 6.
