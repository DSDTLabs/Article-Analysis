RAJKOT: One person was stabbed and three rounds were fired in the air after a financial dispute between three friends took an ugly turn in the city late night on Monday.

 Police said all four were friends but a dispute erupted between them about eight months ago when Jadeja had thrashed one person named Umang Patel in the presence of Kamlesh and others. After a complaint was lodged against him, Jadeja started demanding money from them to pay the lawyer and other court-related expenses. They fought again over the same issue on Monday night on Sadhu Vasvani Road but agreed to settle the dispute once and for all. When Jadeja and his father   reached the pre-decided place, they fought again and Jadeja stabbed Kamlesh. One of the accused then fired three rounds in the air and escaped.
