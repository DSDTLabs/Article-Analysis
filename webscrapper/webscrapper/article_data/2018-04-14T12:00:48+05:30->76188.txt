HYDERABAD: Conceding to persistent demand of Telangana, the   (KRMB) on Friday decided to appoint a joint inspection committee to verify the allegations of water diversion from   project. The committee will include engineers from the two states and will submit a report at the earliest. In a letter to AP and Telangana,   sought their opinion on having a joint inspection mechanism on all water releases from Srisailam and   reservoirs. It will provide Double Check Bench Mark, an authentic water release audit, to the board. 

 Telangana had complained of diversion of nearly 55,000 cusecs of water every day from Pothireddypadu despite repeated instructions from KRMB. Irrigation minister T Harish Rao and chief secretary   had written letters to Union water resources ministry seeking immediate intervention. "We will demand for correction of previous data to give back our rightful share in Krishna waters," said a senior official from irrigation department.
 
 KRMB also decided to complete the process of setting up tamper proof telemetry system at Srisailam project. Though it was decided to install the system in June 2016, but was not completed due to objections from two states. The places where system is installed have not made it operational.
