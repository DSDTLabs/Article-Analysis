NEW DELHI: Reviving an old mechanism of court monitoring action against illegal construction in the city, the Delhi high court has set up a fresh panel.

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar recently slammed the civic agencies for reducing Delhi to a slum by allowing rampant illegal construction.
 
 Saying it is “high time” that “a meaningful order came to be passed” on the problem of illegal constructions plaguing the city, the court has set up a panel of experts to physically inspect such properties.
 
 It has appointed as court commissioner former CBI director D R Karthikeyan, former India Habitat Centre director Raj Liberhan and a retired district judge Ravinder Kaur.
 
 While setting up the panel, HC said, “We are really pained to note that there appears to be no regulatory mechanism in place, no transparency at all and as a result rampant unauthorised construction is coming up all over (which) is a subject matter of multiple proceedings pending before this court.”
 
 Despite there being regulations in place, every day such constructions are being allowed to come up, reducing Delhi not only to a slum but also becoming a hub of disease like chikungunya and dengue, the bench observed.
 
 It authorised the commissioners to inspect properties of all the three municipal bodies in the city and gave them access to original records of the properties by the corporations.
 
 “They will identify each of such properties and will also do a chemical analysis of the construction to determine the date on which the building was built up,” the bench said, asking the Forensic Science Laboratory of the CBI Central to procure the samples for testing if the panel wants.
 
 It said the commissioners will be paid Rs 1 lakh each as fee by the corporations and Rs 2,000 each for every visit to the sites and asked Delhi Police to provide them adequate security while they are visiting the properties.
