Surat: Some people tried to self-immolate to protest against the demolition drive of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in Udhna area of the city on Friday. However, they were caught and handed over to police. SMC officials registered a case for trying to obstruct them from doing their duty. 

 Vishal B Patil had constructed a structure illegally a year ago at Sai Samarpan near Udhna main road. He had built some shops on the ground floor of the building and also installed a lift. SMC Udhna zone received a number of complaints against this illegal construction and he was issued several notices too. At least five people brought some kerosene and poured it on themselves to protest the demolition. However, they were caught and also booked. 
 
 M Nagrajan, Udhna zonal chief, said, “We have been carrying out demolition of illegal structures in the zone. The drive will continue. We will not allow any obstruction to stand in our way.” tnn
