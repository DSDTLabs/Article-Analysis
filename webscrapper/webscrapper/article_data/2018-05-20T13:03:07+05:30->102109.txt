VADODARA: The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested a history-heeter, who was on run since six years in connection with a cheating and forgery case, from Bengaluru on Friday. Police said that in June 2010, the accused Akshay Asher had forged sale deed of a plot in Akota owned by Feni Contractor, who lives at   in Alkapuri. Asher in collusion with four other accused, who were earlier arrested, forged Contractor’s signature and sold off the plot. When Contractor learnt about it, she approached the police and a case was registered at   police station in February 2011.

 In October 2011, police arrested other accused – Bhupendra Shah, Ashok Gujjar, Bharat Thakkar and Mukesh Kikani – while Asher was on run. DCB sleuths searched for him in Mumbai and Vadodara until recently when they learnt that Asher was hiding in Bengaluru. Cops sent a team there and found that Asher was living in a rented apartment on Begur Road. Asher had been theee since over a year to evade arrest.
 
 During interrogation, he admitted that when he learnt that a case was registered against him, he fled to Surat and later to Mumbai. On Saturday, police produced Asher before a judicial magistrate’s court which remanded him to police custody for three days. Police sources said Asher originally hails from Mumbai, where he owned a lock manufacturing factory. Around 20 years back he moved to Vadodara and got involved in bootlegging and immoral trafficking business.
