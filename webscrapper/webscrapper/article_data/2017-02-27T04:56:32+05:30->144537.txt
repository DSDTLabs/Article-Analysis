Twinkle,  , not-so- little star, how I wonder what you are? Each time, I ask you why, you turn around, and wave 'good bye'. No, it doesn't pan out exactly that way. But stars, whatever their worth in salt and  , and with whom we journos share a love-hate relationship, fancy the idea of evading questions. Otherwise what explains their generic stance on relationships, movies and the   in general? Don't believe us? Here's what you'd invariably get from a star if you asked'

 
 : Apparently, you are dating the co-star of your next film?
 
 : Oh these rumours always surface while promoting the film
 
 : Yeah, right!
  
  
 
 
 
 
 : You were seen dining with the industry hottie last night. What's brewing?
 
 : I don't talk about my personal life.
 
 : One more time you say that, I am going to throw up.
  
  
 
 
 
 : Hearsay is that you are in the family way'
 
 : We'll talk about it when we get there.
 
 : Aww, look at you trying to evade the question' How cute!
  
  
 
 
 
 
 : There's gossip making the rounds that you wish to call off your marriage of many years..
 
 : Don't ask me this or I'll call your CEO'
 
 : You are on, my friend... you really are!
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 : We're told you're charging the skies for your next project?
 
 : I don't divulge what I earn.
 
 : Yeah, you can only reveal the   figures, right?
