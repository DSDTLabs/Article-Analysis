SHIMLA: A NITI Aayog report released recently has shown that   at birth in   has recorded a substantial drop. In the base year (2012-14) The state had a sex ratio of 938 girls for every 1,000 boys but in the reference year (2013-15) it came down to 924. This has emphasised the need for states to effectively implement the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, and take appropriate measures to promote the importance of girl child, the report said.

 Himachal Pradesh has fixed the target of improving the girl child sex ratio up to six years of age from 909 as per 2011 census to 940 by 2022. In 2001, the child sex ratio of state was 889. In February, police and health authorities had raided a private hospital at Ghumarwin town of  , where an illegal sex determination test was being conducted. This incident was enough to expose how the girl child was being killed in the womb itself by parents.
 
 While Himachal Pradesh has witnessed a drop in the child sex ratio, neigbouring Punjab has witnessed a slight increase as in the base year (2012-14) the sex ratio was 870 girls for every 1,000 boys, which has now increased to 889 girls in the reference year (2013-15). 
 
 The HP State Commission for Women chairperson, Daisy Thakur, said the dwindling child sex ratio was a matter of concern and the government was serious on the issue. “The government is strictly monitoring the clinics, but still people are going for illegal sex determination test that has resulted in a decline in the child sex ratio. Strict measures need to be taken to stop the illegal practice,” she maintained.
 
 The falling girl child sex ratio in Himachal Pradesh, especially in districts bordering Punjab, Haryana and  , has become a cause of concern for the state government. Last year, the state health authorities had come out with the idea of conducting a sting operation of pre-natal sex determination tests, especially at ultrasound centres located along the state shared border. In Himachal Pradesh, around 265 ultrasound clinics are registered, of which 86 are in government sector and 179 in private sector. The government even wanted to hire private detective agencies for the purpose. 
 
 In July 2016, a report, “The State of Female Infanticide in Himachal Pradesh”, was released by the Asian Centre for Human Rights that stated that the child sex ratio had declined from 982 females per 1,000 boys (up to six years of age) in 1971 to 909 in 2011 in Himachal Pradesh. A World Bank report released in January 2015 said from 1981 to 2011, the number of females to every 1,000 males had plummeted in the state. It said such a sharp decline implicated sex-selective abortions and gross neglect of female children. 
 
 The report said it was true that stated preferences for sons seemed to have declined from 1992 to 2005, when the first and third rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) were conducted. It added this change in attitude seemed to have gone hand-in-hand with a slight improvement in the child sex ratio between the 2001 and the 2011 censuses, but the state government would need to keep a close watch to ensure this trend continued.
