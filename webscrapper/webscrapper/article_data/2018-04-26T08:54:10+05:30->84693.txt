NEW DELHI: Minister for women and child development   has stressed that minor boys who are survivors of child sex abuse should be treated on par with girls, saying the   plans to commission a first-of-its-kind study on such male survivors.

 
 Maneka’s reaction came to a petition by filmmaker-activist Insia Dariwala who said, “male child sexual abuse is an ignored reality in India”.
 
 “There shall be no tolerance of any form of sexual violence against children and all criminals will be dealt with severe action,”   said.
 
 “In February 2018, we announced that we will consider measures to help adult survivors of child sexual abuse to report their abusers. Another much neglected sphere of child sexual abuse are male survivors. Child sexual abuse is gender neutral. Boys who are sexually abused as children spend a lifetime of silence because of the stigma and shame attached to male survivors speaking out. It is a serious problem and needs to be addressed,” the minister said.
