I am also going to demand for the white paper on sewerage and dumping and water distribution system as crores have been spent on these in the last few years, but nothing has changed. 
 
 
 
 Along with water supply, sewage and roads, I will look into issues pertaining to the transport system and facilities at CSM hospital. There are talks of turning the hospital into a Multispecialty one, but it sadly lacks basic facilities. 
 
 
 
 Yes, I am surprised at the way the administration is trying to dominate itself with the functioning of the TMC by trying to force feed its concepts for the city without consulting the elected representatives. It looks like the administration is more interested in politics than fulfilling its responsibilities. I have seen how the Opposition members and a few others were silenced during the Parmar incident in 2015. The administration and political fraternity has to work together for the development of the city. 
 
 
 
 Yes. It is completely unjustified that the administration relocated the cabin without even consulting us. They relocated the cabin from the second floor to a nondescript location on the ground floor which is inadequate to handle the volume of visitors. I am determined to not allow this domination of the administration to continue and have written to the mayor that I will operate from the corridors if the old office of the leader of Opposition is not given back to us.
