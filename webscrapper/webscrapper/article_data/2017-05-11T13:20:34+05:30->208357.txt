PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) hopes that the situation arising due to implementation of alternate-day   supply in the municipal limits will   in a week.

 Municipal commissioner Shravan   shared, “The civic body had started implementing   water   as a preventive measure even before I assumed office. Where earlier the civic body was supplying 450 MLD water to the city, now we have enforced only a 20 per cent water cut. We have been supplying water on alternate days from May 2 but this does not mean that there is a 50 per cent water cut.”
 
 Hardikar explained that the PCMC is currently supplying 450 MLD water supply to half the city on one day. Residents must store this water and use it judiciously over two days. “We are supplying adequate at good pressure as of now. As we are providing two days worth of water supply in a single day, the water pressure is more and is expected to reach even areas located in the tail-end pockets as well as those areas located at a height,” the civic chief stated.
 
 However, residents from several areas like Sangvi, Nigdi, Wakad, and others, have complained of low pressure water supply. Hardikar explained, “People living in slums and in single-storied houses that do not have water storage facilities in their homes may be suffering as they cannot store water to be used for the next day as well. If there are any local complaints of water supply, then residents must contact officials of the water supply department, who will sort out the problem.”
