Gurgaon:   allegedly   by jumping in front of a moving train on the  , just metres away from the   (GRP) station, on Wednesday afternoon. The police removed the bodies from the tracks after at least two trains had already run over them, mutilating them further in the process.

 In a video that has gone viral, a train is seen running over the already beheaded bodies before police arrive an hour later to clear the tracks.
 
 Police said 22-year-old Gulshan, a BA first-year student and resident of Uttam Nagar in Rewari, and 23-year-old Sunita, mother of two and resident of Hansaka village in Rewari, were in love and allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a train on the Delhi-Jaipur track between Khalilpur and Rewari junction.
 
 According to sources, the duo allegedly jumped in front of the train around 2.30pm. Their beheaded bodies were spotted by two passersby half-an-hour later. At that very instant, another train from Rewari towards Delhi ran over the bodies.
 
 The eyewitnesses immediately informed police, who reached the spot and removed the bodies from the tracks. They also recovered the couple’s cellphones on the tracks. The families of the deceased were called to identify the bodies. 
 
 “We arrived at the spot at 3.14pm. We don’t know how many trains passed over before we finally removed the bodies from the tracks. Sunita and Gulshan were neighbours and fell in love. Sunita’s family had moved from Uttam Nagar to Hansaka village six months ago. Her husband is a labourer. Gulshan was a student of government college, Kharkhara. We have lodged a report and handed over the bodies to the kin after postmortem,” said sub-inspector Hoshiyar Singh, the investigating officer.
