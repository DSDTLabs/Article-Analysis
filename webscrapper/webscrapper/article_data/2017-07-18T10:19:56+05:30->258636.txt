On Monday, a large number of student leaders, including those who have recently been blacklisted by the authorities, arrived at the office of the dean student welfare (DSW) and staged their protest over the issue.

 On the issue of the blacklisted student leaders entering the campus, Dubey said, "Our guards are not equipped to handle such rowdy elements who disgrace the V-C or other office bearers of the administration openly. I am writing to the district administration to take necessary steps to stop their entry." 
 
 He said a meeting of AUTA (Allahabad University Teachers' Association) would be held on Tuesday on the issue of regular protests on the campus and humiliation faced by the teaching faculty who are also on various administrative posts.
