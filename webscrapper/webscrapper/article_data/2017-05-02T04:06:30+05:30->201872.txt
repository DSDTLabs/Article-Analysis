AHMEDABAD: The state government, which had given 10% quota in admissions to students from economically backward class has decided to do away with the  . The decision to scrap the quota was taken following court order.

 On Monday, the government declared the rules for admission to engineering and pharmacy courses in Gujarat. According to the rules, there would be no EBC quota this year, while the merit list for the admissions will be prepared on the basis of scores attained in Gujarat Common Entrance Test and the marks obtained in respective board examinations.
 
 “Admissions to state engineering colleges will be granted on basis of merit list prepared by giving 60% weightage to class XII scores and 40% weightage to GujCET scores,” said a senior officer of the Admission Committee for Professional Courses (ACPC). He added that the new rules have made it compulsory to appear for GujCET to be eligible for admission in engineering or pharmacy courses in Gujarat.
 
 However, the rules also clearly state that seats left vacant after admission rounds of GujCET qualified students are completed, colleges will be permitted to relax eligibility.
 
 The government has also said that this year, only GujCET marks will be considered for admission in pharmacy courses. Last year, the ACPC had also considered NEET examination scores of students for admission in pharmacy courses. But this year only GujCET scores will matter.
 
 ACPC officials said that there would be a single merit list for admission to engineering and pharmacy, unlike last year where there were separate merit lists.
