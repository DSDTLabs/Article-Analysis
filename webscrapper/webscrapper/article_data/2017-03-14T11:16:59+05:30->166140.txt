VISAKHAPATNAM: The   implemented may pose huge problems for teachers in a hurry to complete the syllabus for the   from March 17 to April 1. Sources in the education department said they may not have enough time to revise the syllabus completely with the schools running for just three days from March 13 to 16.

 Some teachers complained that they had to rush through the syllabus as chapters were yet to be completed. District education officer, Vizag, CV Renuka, dismissed these allegations and said, “ We were informed in advance that the exams would be held in mid-March and were thoroughly prepared for it. Shortening of school hours for a few days will not have any impact on students but only give them time to stay home and prepare.”
