PATNA:   on Sunday rubbished all the allegations regarding his family members’ land deals levelled by BJP senior functionary   (SuMo). He said there was no substance in the allegations.
 
  Addressing a press conference at his residence, Lalu said a few BJP functionaries were making all-out efforts to demoralize him by indulging in “character assassination” of his family. “They indulged in a similar act of character assassination of   in UP,” he said.
  
  Replying to a question as to how some members of his family have got plots of land at cheaper rates, Lalu used a Bhojpuri maxim, “Bel paka to kaua ke baap ka kya? (Even if the bel (wood apple) is ripe, a crow can’t taste the fruit).” Lalu meant to say as to why some people were so bothered if members of his family purchased some land at cheaper rates. He said all the rules and regulations were followed in such land deals.
  
  Attacking SuMo, the RJD chief said the BJP functionary had been quoting exaggerated figures about land purchased by his family members. He said SuMo had been portraying even general agricultural field as ‘Farm House’.
  
  When asked why his daughter and Rajya Sabha member   concealed the fact about land purchase from the Election Commission, Lalu retorted, “Have we concealed? Nothing has been concealed. Everything has been revealed to the appropriate authorities.”
  
  He also alleged that some people have taken ‘supari’ from his political opponents to do his character assassination.
