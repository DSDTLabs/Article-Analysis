 Vin Diesel arrived in Mumbai on Thursday, January 12, 2017. The star actor and his Indian co-star,   Padukone, captivated the audiences with their antics and warm chemistry.

 Now, Deepika has re-shared a picture that was originally posted by Vin. The picture has DP and Vin flashing their pearly whites while holding glasses of cutting chai in their hands. Besides them is a steaming vessel and a jar of tea leaves, indicating that they went behind the desk of a tea vendor to click this cute picture. 
 
  
  
 Vin's original caption read, 'Global... India already breaking records... you called it. Wow. #Blessed #Grateful'. Their film released in India over the weekend and has received a great response from the audiences so far. The actors seem to be celebrating their success with a toast of chai, perhaps.
