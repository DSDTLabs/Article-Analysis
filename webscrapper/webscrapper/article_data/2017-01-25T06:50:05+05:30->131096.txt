 Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Dr Kiran Kulkarni, Rotary coordinator, spoke about the various aspects of deformities. He said that every day, about 12 to 13 patients will be operated upon during the camp. Patients will be admitted to the hospital a day before the operation, Kulkarni added.
 
 Babies suffering from cleft lip or palate deformity find it difficult to suck motherâ€™s milk after birth which results in frequent feed and toilet habits, said Dr Kulkarni. Surgeries can be performed on children above the age of 11 months. Once operated upon, children can lead a normal look and enjoy better health. These are one-time curative procedures. 
 
 Present at the press conference were Arvind Bakde, president, Mahesh Mokha, Shashank Vishwarupe, Rajinder Khurana, Vilas Shende, director of Mure Memorial Hospital, Dr Sanjeev Jaiswal, director of   from DHS and Tarun Patel.
