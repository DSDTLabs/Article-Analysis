 "I was like 'B,' and she said, 'Hi, Dad.' I was like, 'You're OK?' Because she sounded a little tired because she's working on the Grammy performance. We just had a wonderful daughter-dad conversation. But I'm not gonna tell you all of that..."
 
 "Beyonce and I had a great conversation. I'm looking forward to seeing her soon and I told her, 'Look, slow down a little bit. You need to slow down a little bit'," he said.
