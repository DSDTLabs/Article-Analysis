THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau has sought more time to submit the final report in the   probe involving former finance minister  , on which the agency is continuing its probe on the instructions of the court.

 The agency, which submitted a report on the current position of the case before the vigilance court here on Thursday, said that the final report will be submitted by March 31. The agency reasoned that the probe report is getting delayed as the forensic report from   has not yet been received.
 
 The agency also informed the court that since deputy superintendent of police Naj mal Hassan, who was probing the case, had gone on leave, another officer is probing the case now. The court had earlier directed the agency to continue probe against Mani after considering an intimation before the court by vigilance special investigation unit SP R Sukeshan, who had earlier probed the case, that he had not considered certain facts in his earlier probe.
 
 Though the court ordered continuation of the probe, the probe was handed over to   after Sukesan requested the vigilance director to exclude him from the responsibility.
