NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Kapil   is not likely to argue in the   demolition case in the coming days with Muslim parties in the dispute saying that he will be required on arguments on the Constitutional issues that will come up a little later. Sibal has not appeared in the last couple of hearings, and may not do so in the coming hearing either.

 
 While his absence set off speculation that Sibal may have been asked by Congress to withdraw from the case, the Muslim litigants said it was a temporary break as far as they know. They said they were not aware of any instruction from Congress to Sibal. A key lawyer in the case and member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Zafaryab Jilani said, “We need Sibal for arguments on constitutional issues. That stage would come later and not on the next hearing on April 6. In the meanwhile, Rajiv Dhawan is leading the arguments.”
 
 In the wake of the speculation, all eyes are on future arguments in the   to see if Sibal is still part of the legal team in the case. Sibal is the lawyer for the oldest litigant from the Babri side.
 
 A controversy had erupted during the Gujarat elections when Sibal had argued in the SC that the case be deferred beyond the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. PM   had picked on the comment to question Congress if this was the party’s official line during state election campaign. The speculation is seen to be linked with the approach of Karnataka assembly elections and comment by Congress leader   that BJP has succeeded in painting Congress as a Muslim party.
