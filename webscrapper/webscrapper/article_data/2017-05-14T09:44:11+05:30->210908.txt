PUNE: The Hadapsar police has arrested a 54-year-old man and his son, both residents of   near Hadapsar, for allegedly setting up a flour mill and a cement shop on fire.

 The crime was committed in the early hours of Friday. The police said that it was the fallout of some property dispute.
 
  (54) and his son Kalpesh (25) were arrested on Saturday.
 
 Kantilal’s brother Dinkar (55) has lodged a complaint against the two.
 
 According to the complaint,   runs a flour mill and a cement shop in the area. Kantilal claimed there was a dispute over the land division of the property.
 
 Sub-inspector B S Doiphode of the Hadapsar police station told TOI that the brothers had a dispute over eight gunthas of land. 
 
 “Dinkar rushed to the police station on Friday morning and lodged the complaint. He alleged that Kantilal was behind the torching of the commercial spaces located adjacent to each other,” he said.
 
 Doiphode said the complainant had put up some iron rods at the place. Kantilal and his son objected to this. “They alleged that Dinkar was trying to encroach the land,” he said.
 
 According to Doiphode, it is an ancestral property and both brothers are contending to gain possession. They are also fighting a legal battle in the civil court. 
 
 “The duo then set the commercial spaces on fire. However, none of the shops had sustained any major damage,” Doiphode said.
 
 However, considering the serious nature of the offence, the police have arrested the father-son duo, Doiphode went on to add.
