HYDERABAD: Railway crossings across the state have become a major hurdle for the completion of irrigation projects. The department has identified 36 railway crossing halting the execution of the key projects. As the response from the railways is not matching up to the pace of irrigation department, the irrigation works in more than 4.7 lakh acres of land are blocked.

 According to   sources, proposals were prepared for construction of rail over bridges at 460 railway level crossings in the state. The ministry of railways had approved construction of 52 ROBs in the current fiscal of which construction of 16 ROBs was nearing completion.
 
 
 Irrigation minister   had requested the railways in February to speed up the works, but there has not been much progress. The state government even paid ?68 crore to the Railways to take up works on a fast track. As per the original plan, the railways are supposed to complete works on 30 crossings covering eight irrigation projects. However, only half of the works were taken up, citing paucity of funds. This year, the railways is suppose to take up another 56 works covering 11projects. Of this, it could complete only 16 works so far, while 49 other works are in different stages.
 
 Railways and the state government will equally share the estimated cost of ?2,700 crore for construction of these ROBs. The roads and buildings department has been entrusted with the construction works besides taking up development of approach roads on both sides of railway tracks.
 
 “Getting necessary permissions from the Centre and railway ministry is taking enormous time. This in turn is leading to a delay in completion of irrigation projects. We have reviewed the issue with SCR senior officials,” said a senior official in the irrigation department.
 
 Key projects like Kaleswaram, Bheema, Devadula, Nettempadu, Koilsagar and   are hit by delay in relocation of railway crossings.
