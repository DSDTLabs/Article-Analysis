PATNA: Bihar   on Monday virtually declined to order a probe into BJP functionary Sushil Kumar Modi’s allegations regarding land deals by RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s family, saying it’s the Centre’s domain.

 Nitish said matters related to the Companies Act come under the purview of the central government. “RJD and   have replied to the allegations made by   and the BJP. Is there any need of my reaction over those allegations?” Nitish said in response to a query regarding his stand on the allegations against Lalu’s family. 
 
 Interacting with media persons after his weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ programme here, Nitish said one side (BJP) is making allegations against the second party, who are also making counter-allegations. “If BJP thinks there is really some merit in its allegations, it should approach the law. What sort of inquiry we (state government) can do when the allegations are not under the state purview?” Nitish quipped.
 
 Deputy CM and Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who has also been accused of acquiring land quid pro quo, was sitting beside the CM. 
 
 Without taking the name of either BJP or Sushil Modi, Nitish also said such an environment was being created in the state that all good works of the grand alliance government seemed ‘insignificant’. He said some people were unnecessarily targeting his government. “We mainly concentrate on positive works for better life of the state’s people,” he said.
 
 To a question, the CM also advised media persons to get the BJP’s allegations and RJD’s counter-allegations probed in details at their level. “Allegations are being levelled at wholesale rate. You people can also investigate,” Nitish said.
