MUMBAI: It is learnt that one of the   namely 226, which has now turned into an   for women, is likely to see an   from present corporator Makarand Narwekar’s family, in the fray.

 Cuffe Parade resident Harshita  , sister-in-law of  , has already started meeting prominent resident groups in the area seeking their support.
 
 However when asked, Makarand said choosing another independent candidate would be done by citizens, in a democratic way as in the last election. “We are definitely planning to replicate the same thing that was done in the last civic elections wherein the citizens asked me to contest as their representative. In the past, this electoral ward has never seen any promising candidate and therefore this time we want it to have someone who knows what issues the entire ward has been facing,” added Narwekar. A lawyer, he contested the 2012 civic election as an independent candidate and won from Colaba. 
 
 “We want a corporator who would be educated and more approachable, with a good sense of communication. Although our ward has turned into a ladies’ ward, we do not want a candidate with no adequate experience or knowledge, which some political parties field only because the reservation of a ward has changed,” said B M Chaturvedi, vice-chairman of the Cuffe Parade Residents’ Association.
