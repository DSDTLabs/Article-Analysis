Gurgaon: A parents’ body on Monday filed a complaint with the divisional commissioner of Gurgaon, D Suresh, alleging arbitrary fee   by the   School in Sector 51. Last week, over 150   visited the office of deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh to share their grievances with him. 

 While speaking to TOI, parents said they had received a   on March 13 about the 10% hike in the development fee. “Most of us are from middle class families. Such arbitrary hikes pinch our pockets,” a parent said pleading anonymity. The parents are required to submit the fees by April 10, as per the latest circular.
 
 The letter submitted by the parents to the deputy commissioner on March 22 stated that ‘the school has been charging an amount of approx. Rs 43,000 in the name of Admission and Development charges every year’. It further mentioned that according to Haryana School Education Rules 2003 and Haryana School Education Rules Amendment 2007, no school is authorised to charge the students in this manner every year.
 
 Vivek Grover, president, Parent Teacher association of Presidium School further mentioned that authorities did not furnish Form 6 which is, under Section 158 A, mandatory to be provided by the schools.
 
 Parents said that they have been raising this issue with the school authorities, however, they are still waiting for a response. “We have sent countless mails regarding this issue to the teachers, including vice principal Alka Singh, but none of them have responded to our mails,” Grover said. 
 
 “Every year, our children receive circulars about the 10 percent development   hike. But we cannot understand how this hike is justified. They just want us to pay through our nose,” another parent complained.
 
 District education officer Neelam Bandhari told TOI that she would call the representatives from school in a day or two to get an update. Meanwhile, despite repeated attempts TOI could not get a response from school authorities.
