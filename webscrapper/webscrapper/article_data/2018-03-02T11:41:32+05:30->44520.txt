JABALPUR/ BHOPAL: In a major relief to   Hemant Katare,   bench of the   high court (MPHC) on Thursday stayed proceedings of   police’s FIR against him till next hearing, which has been scheduled for March 6.

 
 Two separate petitions filed by Katare in the high court seeking quashing of both FIRs against him — one filed by a journalism student accusing him of rape and another by her mother charging him with abduction and illegal confinement — were heard.
 
 During the hearing, the girl, who was caught by the crime branch on charge of blackmailing Katare, reached the court with her mother and raised objections. She broke down in the court room and said Katare was threatening her and her mother with dire consequences and therefore should not be granted bail.
 
 Justice Rajeev Kumar Dubey, who was hearing the case, asked the advocate to take the girl and her mother outside the courtroom. Advocate   counselled them and requested them to stay outside the courtroom so that the hearing could be continued.
 
 Earlier, the girl had sent an application to DIG, Bhopal from jail while she was in judicial custody, accusing the   MLA of rape. On the basis of the application, an FIR was lodged against Katare at Mahila Thana on the charge of rape. Another FIR was lodged by the girl’s mother at Bajaria police station charging Katare with illegal confinement and rape.
 
 More than two weeks after the FIRs were lodged against Katare, cops had announced a reward of Rs 10,000 on his arrest. His counsel Priyanshu Jain, the same day moved two separate petitions seeking quashing of both the FIRs and stay on Katare’s arrest.
