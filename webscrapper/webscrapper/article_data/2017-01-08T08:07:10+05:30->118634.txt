AHMEDABAD: It came as a shock for   when he found that someone had withdrawn online Rs 8 lakh from his two bank accounts. There was more surprise in stock for the young engineering consultant. He learned later that a duplicate sim card of his cellphone number had been used to generate   (OTP) from the bank to push through the transactions.

 Cyber cell officials, however, believe it to be an insider job, as the hacker knew not only the victim’s account numbers, but also his cellphone number and other personal details. “We suspect that not only was a duplicate sim card made by the offenders, but Patel’s e- mail account was also hacked, so that he could not receive a mail alert of the online banking withdrawal,” said a cyber- cell official.
 
 ‘While the new sim card was from Vadodara, we also have the details of the account number to which the amount was transferred from Patel’s account,” said a cyber-cell official.
 
 Patel told TOI that on Saturday he found his cellphone was not working. “I could not do much as the next day was Sunday. I approached the service provider on Tuesday and learned that somebody had already obtained a duplicate sim card with my identity documents,” said Patel.
 
 He immediately contacted the city crime branch’s cyber cell and lodged a complaint, said Patel. 
 
 Patel added that he was not new to   and had been making online transactions for about a year. “This is the first time that money has been withdrawn from my account online,” he said. 
 
  said they have been receiving such complaints and have already started working on apprehending such accused. We have also formed a special team to identify fraud callers who, posing as bank officials, obtain passwords and personal identification numbers (PIN) from account holders, and then withdraw their money,” said a cyber crime official.
