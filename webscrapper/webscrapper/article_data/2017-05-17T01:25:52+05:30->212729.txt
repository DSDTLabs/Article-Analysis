MUMBAI: To avoid delay in   projects due to   allotment and transfer issues, the state cabinet on Tuesday laid down new set of rules which makes it mandatory for government agencies to give advance possession of the land required for a public   in 90 days.

 Projects of mass transit like monorail,  , railway line, drinking water projects, medium and large dams, MIDC projects or any other project that has been approved by the cabinet or the cabinet sub committee on infrastructure, will be included in the list of public projects. 
 
 “Currently there is no rules, some departments take their own time to transfer the land to the project implementing agency and it leads to delay in the project and also in many cases leads to cost escalation,” said an official from the revenue department. The metro-III project is moving slowly as the PWD land near   has not been handed over yet.
