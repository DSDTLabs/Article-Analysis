MADURAI: The secretary of the   has been issued a notice on a contempt petition which stated that the department officials had failed to obey a court order dated January 25 last year directing them to implement bio-metric attendance system in all hospitals within four months.

 One C Anan Raj from Madurai filed the contempt plea. The case came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice C T   of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel said that the health and family welfare department on September 20, 2012 passed a government order to introduce bio-metric system in all government medical colleges, medical college hospitals and attached institution, government headquarters hospitals, taluk and non – taluk hospitals,   dispensaries and primary health centres to monitor and regulate the attendance of all the staff working there. 
 
 The government had instructed the officials - directorate of medical education, director of medical and rural health service, director of public health and preventive medicine, commissioner of Indian medicine and homoeopathy, had to brought the system in force. Due to failure on the part of officials the writ petition was filed. 
 
 Now, even a lapse of one year, the officials had not chosen to introduce bio-metric system. The petitioner also issued notice to the officials on March 9. Hence, it was necessary to initiate contempt proceedings against the officials, the counsel said. 
 
 Majority of staff including doctors are not coming to work in time. Many doctors run private nursing homes, due to which they come late to the hospitals and leave them early. Bringing the bio-metric attendance system in hospitals will help to provide a better health care to the patients, the counsel said.
