MEERUT: In a major embarrassment for the ruling BJP, two of its MLAs —   (Kithore) and   ( ) — staged a protest and raised slogans against the police department at the office of   senior superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Pandey on Saturday.
 
  The legislators later met the   and confronted him over the “goondaraj” prevalent in the region. “How are we different from the previous regime whom we blamed for lawlessness? Criminals are running amok and police have been clueless,” Khatik told the senior cop.
  
  Raking up the “Love Jihad” issue, the MLAs demanded the immediate arrest of a youth named Shahzad, who had allegedly abducted a married woman from another community in Meerut’s Pariksitgarh area on April 8 and later shot at her brother.
  
  Accompanied by their supporters, the legislators spoke to the SSP for half-an-hour and agreed to return only after the senior cop assured them that strict action will be taken in the case highlighted by them. “The abduction took place in April. Had police shown some interest, they could have recovered the woman. Now, the matter has reached court and cops claim that they cannot do much,” Khatik said.
  
  The delegation also urged Pandey to raise the bounty on Shahzad from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh. “Shahzad and the woman have approached Allahabad high court and there is little that we can do at this point. However, we will try to put together a strong case against him for his other crimes, including a recent matter of attempt to murder,” the SSP said.
