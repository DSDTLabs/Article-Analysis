HYDERABAD: Two days after being denied a wheelchair for refusing to bribe a ward boy at the Gandhi  , 40-year-old Raju was given a brand new wheelchair at his Begumpet home on Sunday, by a city-based trust. His treatment is scheduled to begin on Monday. 

 "We decided to give Raju a wheelchair after reading about his plight in newspapers. Members of our trust will be donating 10 wheelchairs to the   on Monday," said Karodimal Agarwal, chairman, Agarwal Samaj Sahayta Trust. 
  
  
 Apart from independent organisations, even   government has suddenly sprung into action to provide Raju with necessary aid post Thursday's incident when he took to riding a toy tricycle within hospital premises to expose bribery in the state-run hospital. Following an inquiry, the hospital management sacked two staffers on Saturday, assuring action against ward boys identified by the victim and his wife Santoshi. 
 
 While activists working in the healthcare sector have appreciated the authorities' swift action, they also wondered if every patient must launch similar protests to make their grievances heard. They also raised concerns over thousands of other patients who are forced to run from pillar to post every day to avail of basic facilities at state-run hospitals. 
 
 "The bribe culture is a systemic issue. By terminating employees, the problem will not be resolved. The government must get to the root of the issue so that others too can benefit from the facilities without any fuss," said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president and managing trustee of Helping Hand.
