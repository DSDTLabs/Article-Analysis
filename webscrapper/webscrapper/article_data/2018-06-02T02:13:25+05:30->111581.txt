NEW DELHI: The   (I-T) department launched the   Informants Reward Scheme on Friday under which a person can get a reward of up to Rs 1 crore for giving information to tax authorities about benami transactions and properties of Indians in the country. 

 
 A similar reward scheme for information about benami assets in foreign countries can earn a reward of up to Rs 5 crore, with even foreigners eligible for the reward.
 
 “With the objective of obtaining people’s participation in the income tax department’s efforts to unearth   and reduce tax evasion, a new reward scheme has been issued, superseding the earlier reward scheme,” a press note issued by the   (CBDT) said.
 
 “For information about income and assets actionable under the Black Money Act, a reward of up to Rs 5 crore has been introduced in the new reward scheme,” according the CBDT note. 
 
 The amount has been kept high to make   attractive to potential sources in foreign countries to provide information, the CBDT said. 
 
 The I-T department has amended the I-T Informants Reward Scheme under which a person can get a reward of up to Rs 50 lakh for giving actionable information on evasion of tax on assets in India. 
 
 The I-T is already empowered to investigate assets of Indians in foreign countries under Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) Act. Under the 2015 act, the department can recover tax on such undisclosed assets and impose penalty and launch prosecution.
