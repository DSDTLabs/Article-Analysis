For college students, who are usually on a tight budget, eating out every day or walking into high-end salons for beauty treatments is a luxury most can't afford. So the idea of getting day-to-day essentials such as bakery products at a subsidised rate surely sounds promising. That's what the students who have enrolled for  's   (CIE) classes have been doing under Project Aspire. What started as a programme under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) to support the entrepreneurship skills among weaker sections of the society, has turned into Make In Jamia to provide goods and services to students, staff and faculty at affordable prices on the campus.

 The programme was initially started in 2016, but was stalled due to some reason. When Zishan Husain Khan took over as the director of the CIE, he decided to utilize the projects. "We are training students who come from not-so-financially stable backgrounds and with the training, we are able to help the university as well. With the support of Talat Ahmad, Vice-Chancellor, we thought of taking it to the revenue model in the premises of the university. That is how our main units – packaged water bottles, bakery products, tailoring services and an in-house beauty parlour - provides services to everyone in the university at cheaper prices. The demand for packaged drinking water is huge, and after procuring certification, we will be providing these water bottles to canteens and at university events as well," he says.

 The entire unit has around 30 students and the programme spans over four months. All those who are enrolled in the programme are school or college dropouts who wish to open their own business or work with the university at the unit.  , trainer at the beauty parlour, tells us that she has seven students under her. "The parlour is open for regular students, teachers and women from neighbourhood as well. Students can drop in anytime during working hours and avail the services at affordable prices," she explains.

 Mohammad Saad, a school pass-out who lives in Jasola, is a student at Jamia’s training units. He wanted to enroll himself for college, but the financial condition of his family forced him to look for a professional course that could help him earn money. Faraz Ismail, another such student, says, "I come from a village in  . I wanted to start my own bakery shop, but I didn’t have the skills or money. So when I got to know about the programme, I joined it."

 Talat Ahmad, VC of Jamia, says, "The centre not only helps develop entrepreneurial skills in youngsters who have not attained higher education or are unable to secure employment, but also fulfills Jamia's mandate to serve the socially and economically underprivileged sections of society. This is a significant step towards self-reliance of our youth," he says.
