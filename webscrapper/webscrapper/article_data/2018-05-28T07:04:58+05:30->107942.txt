PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly   on Sunday took a dig at CM  , saying the latter had supported demonetisation but was now questioning it, and soon he may describe the move as the biggest scam of the country.

 
 Tejashwi, who was deputy CM in the then grand alliance government led by   Kumar, said, “Nitish is always years behind in understanding the issues, difficulties and demands of common people.”
 
 While addressing a meeting of the state level bankers’ committee on Saturday, Nitish had said that expected benefits of note ban could not reach the common people due to “dubious role” of the banks.
 
 A day after Nitish’s statement,   on Sunday tweeted, “Our beloved Nitish Chacha took another sharp U-turn. He supported demonetisation but now questioning it... He is always years behind in understanding the issues, difficulties & demands of common people. Don’t be surprised if he calls demonetisation the biggest scam of India (sic).” 
 
 Despite being in the grand alliance government, Nitish had strongly backed PM   when he announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on November 8, 2016. Since then, he had been speaking in favour of the demonetisation and its good effects. It is for the first time that Nitish has questioned the bankers’ role in effective implementation of the note ban. Nitish also raised question on overall result of the demonetisation when he asked, “Did we get the benefits that we ought to have gotten from the demonetisation?”
