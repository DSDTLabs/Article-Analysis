SRINAGAR: State finance ministers, cutting across party lines, said they were working on rolling out goods and services   from July as consultations to work out product-wise levies concluded in Srinagar.

 The statements came amid suggestions from West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra that businesses were not ready for a transition and this could impact the economy and state finances. While Mitra did not recommend a date, there have been suggestions in some quarters that it would be better to launch the biggest tax reform initiative from September.
 
 The outer limit for   rollout is mid-September given that the Constitution amendment provided a one-year window.
 
 “Now it’s only a question of details. We are working towards the July 1 deadline. Most of the issues have been sorted out but we need to ensure that the exercise is revenue-neutral (which will not impact consumers),” said Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, while demanding a minimum 5% levy on gold. 
 
 “Gold is luxury, not a necessity. In the last one decade, price has quadrupled and nobody had any problem. So what is the big trouble with a 5% tax,” he said.
 
 States are split over how much should be the levy with those such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra backing a lower 1% tax on the yellow metal.
 
 Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia too suggested that the AAP government was in favour of a July launch. He said the definition of service where it is delivered was vague and sought clarification.
