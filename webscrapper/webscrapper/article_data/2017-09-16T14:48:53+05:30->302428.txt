PANAJI:   is one of the bastions of the coastal fishing communities, carrying on the threatened ‘ramponn’ traditions. A   on Sunday, September 17, promises to showcase the skills the locals have honed over decades.

 Hauling the ramponn (net) carried out by a   to some distance off the coast to the shore is a more laborious way of catching fish. “We will show people at the fest how we cast the net and haul it with the fish to the shore,”  , a local youth said.
 
 Villagers are agog and children, men and women are equally immersed in preparations for the big event. A fishermen’s fest of this type was held in   some years back, but it was more impromptu and enthusiasts participated in it rather than fishermen.
 
 Villagers of Arambol take pride in plying the occupation of their forefathers. “A ramponn needs at least 25 persons to pull it with wooden staff and it takes about an hour to land the catch on shore,” Monteiro said.
 
 The village has two ramponns even as these big boats with extensive nets are being seen less now. “The peak season is late monsoon and soon after,” a fisherman said.
 
 With Goa’s festakar, Marius helping out, it will have the staple of no plastic, no chief guest, no liquor and other aspects. The seniors relished the joys of roasting freshly caught fish. “Crabs roasted in hay are delicious,” a local said.
 
 The festival will have a football coaching camp with Ansu Rodrigues helping out. Ghumtancho Nach will be led by Carlos Gonsalves and later Olav singing at the fest.
