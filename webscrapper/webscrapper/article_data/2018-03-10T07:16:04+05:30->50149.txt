AHMEDABAD: The   high   has ordered the transfer of investigation from   to the state   (crime) in connection with the abduction and torture of a teen. His tormentors released the video of the crime that went viral in   in December last year. The victim studies in standard 11. On December 15, 2017, while he was riding a bike on his way to school, he was abducted by five persons. He was stripped and inflicted with cigarette-butt burns. More than fifty days later, following a public uproar, Himmatnagar Police arrested the accused and booked them for minor charges. They were released on bail soon thereafter.

 The teenâ€™s father moved the high court for the transfer of investigation and demanded the invocation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). He also furnished the video clip and photographs to the court. After hearing the case, Justice   said that the teen was mercilessly assaulted and the police initially took the matter very lightly, and did not take appropriate action, maybe due to political influence.
 
 The judge said that the case appeared to be of outright goondaism. He said the investigation was perfunctory and it should be carried out by a higher agency. The investigator has been directed to consider whether POCSO charges can be invoked in this case because the boy was stripped and his video was made viral.
