Rajkot: Two months after a factory owner committed suicide, Kuvadva police arrested a private money lender for allegedly driving him to the extreme step. 

 On December 12, 2017, Rohit Kagathra (28), who lived in Rajkot, had consumed some poisonous substance at his Somnath Spintex unit near Wankaner. However, the reason for the drastic step was not known then. 
 
 On Tuesday, his brother and other family members went to the factory to collect his belongings. While sifting through his clothes, they found a seven-page suicide note in which he had named Bechar Dubadiya from whom he had borrowed Rs 93 lakh and his friend Mehul Chhatrola to whom he had lent Rs 75 lakh. 
 
 The note states that Chhatrola was dilly-dallying over repayment of the money and had even threatened him not to demand. Kagathara also wrote that Dubadiya and his aide Suleiman were threatening him to recover Rs 93 lakh. However, as Chhatrola was not returning Rs 75 lakh, he was unable to repay Dubadiya. 
 
 Fed up of the harassment and threats, Kagathara ended his life.
