LUDHIANA: A massive protest was staged by the district unit of the   party on Friday at   against BJP coming to power in Karnataka even when the party fell short of a clear majority. Led by district Congress chief Gurpreet Gogi, several councillors and the party workers shouted slogans against BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. They also staged a ‘Matka fod’ protest.

 Speaking on the occasion, Gogi said, “This is a clear-cut case of the murder of democracy and open display of gunda tactics by BJP and Modi. On one side, they illegally staked claim to form government in Karnataka despite falling short of a majority, on the other hand, they played dirty politics by removing security from outside the resort where Congress MLAs were camping and later refused them permission from flying out of Bengaluru to Kerala. This is nothing less than dictatorship and Modi has left behind Hitler by going to any level to impose his aristocratic decisions.”
 
 Gogi also said, “BJP is a party full of anarchists and they are inflicting terror upon our countrymen ever since they came to power. But they have been fully exposed now and it is writing on the wall that BJP is going to lose the next general elections.”
 
 Other prominent leaders present in the protest included senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, councillors Amrit Versha Rampal, Dilraj Singh, Harakaran Singh Vaid, Gurmukh Singh Mithu and Manish Kapoor, Harish Sehgal, Vipan Arora, Resham Singh Saggu, Kuldeep Madaan, Gurwinderpal Singh, Gurpreet Singh Gill and Vinod Akhtar.
