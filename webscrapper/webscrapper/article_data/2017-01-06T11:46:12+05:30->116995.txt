SURAT: There is some bad news for Indian diamantaires post-demonetization. The  , whose diamond price list is followed worldwide, has stated that polished   softened in December as Indian liquidity dried up due to government’s decision to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. 

 Rapaport Group pointed out that trading slowed down with dealers in Mumbai and Surat taking vacation and business activity being hit due to shortage of new currency notes in the market. The polished diamond prices in December fell from 0.2 per cent to 3 per cent in different categories starting from 30 cent diamonds to 3 carat diamonds due to demonetization. The biggest fall in prices was witnessed in 50 cent goods at 2.2 per cent.
 
 Out of the 4,000 diamond units in Surat, almost 60 per cent of small and medium units are affected due to demonetization. Around 50,000 diamond workers have been rendered jobless in the last one-and-half-month. Anger is palpable in the diamond markets of Varachha and Mahidhapura in the city as traders have no money to do business.
 
 Rapaport Group stated that Indian jewellery sales slumped and are expected to remain subdued during the first half of this year due to demonetization. Demand fell for lower-quality diamonds typically supplied to India’s domestic market. Indian manufacturing by smaller factories has been stalled, while larger exporters with proper invoicing were less affected by demonetization. 
 
 Diamond analyst   told TOI, “The impact of demonetization is severe on small and medium diamond traders and manufacturers. Many workers have been rendered jobless in Surat as most of the small units are still shut. There is a lull in the diamond markets of Surat as no new dealings are happening. This all signals tough days ahead for the industry. It will take another four months for the industry to recover from the impact of demonetization.”
