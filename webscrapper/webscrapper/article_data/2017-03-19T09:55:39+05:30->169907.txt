GUWAHATI: The All Adivasi Students'  's ( ) 600-km-long padayatra, organized in protest against the delay in   to six communities of the state, concluded in Guwahati on Saturday. 

 Hitting out at   for its 'delaying tactics' in granting ST status, Aasaa said the saffron party won't be allowed to use the tea community as a vote bank time and again. 
 
 "Aasaa warns the BJP-led government at the Centre and the state not to marginalize the adivasis further. Our forefathers contributed a lot towards the socio-economic development of Assam but the way in which successive governments have treated us is inhuman. Adivasi students from tea gardens have been deprived of higher education. They are starving and spending their life without even the basic civic amenities. What is the need of change in power if the plight of the most marginalized community of society remains the same?" questioned Aasaa leader Stephen Lakra.
 
 He cautioned the state government not to see the adivasis as a secured vote bank ahead of the panchayat polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 "BJP just can't keep on using us every election. This padayatra is the beginning of a new movement after BJP came to power by hoodwinking the people," said Lakra.
 
 The students' body also demanded the state government to take prompt steps to raise the daily wage of tea garden workers of the state up to Rs 330 per day as they are finding it difficult to eke out a living with a daily wage of less than Rs 200 a day. 
 
 The Aasaa also urged the government to open secondary and senior secondary schools in tea garden areas of the state to bring down the school dropout ratio in tea gardens. "If the government really wants to change the education scenario of the state, education in tea garden areas must be given top priority. There are no high schools or higher secondary schools in hundreds of tea garden areas of Assam," said the student leader.
