The buck stops at his doorstep, but state education minister   refuses to acknowledge that   have leaked. He impassively terms it as “mischief“ and a “very small matter“. If a paper is out a day or an hour before an exam, that would constitute a leak, he says.While thousands of students may have lost sleep over the Class XII exams, Tawde reasons that aspirants don't have an incentive for cheating given competitive exams like NEET and CET and given that commerce students get admission to their own colleges, hinting that little is at stake in the Class XII exams. Excerpts from an interview:

 
 
 
 A: You cannot call these leaks because the question papers are getting shared after students are entering the exam hall. Some mischief is going on in one or two centres in Mumbai and we have asked the police to get to the root of the matter.
 
 
 
 
 A: How much can one benefit in 10 or 15 or 30 minutes? By and large our system is good because the papers have not been out the previous day or in the morning at 7am once packets reach the exam centres. Also, I cannot understand what is the reason for students to resort to malpractice when there is NEET (for admission to medicine and dentistry) and CET (for entry to engineering colleges) and commerce students get automatic admission to their own college.
 
 
 
 
 A: This is a very small matter, but for me, it is a matter of concern that it is happening in a state like Maharashtra. I am in regular touch with my officials, the police and the cybercrime cell. We have asked them for suggestions and if the cyber police state that our exam staff should not be allowed to carry their cellphones, we will issue that rule too.
 
 
 
 
 A: We have now identified three centres in Mumbai where students have been asked to be in class by 10.30am. Even entering at 10.31am is not permitted. But we also know that this is being done by some person who is opening the question paper packets and has first access to the papers.
