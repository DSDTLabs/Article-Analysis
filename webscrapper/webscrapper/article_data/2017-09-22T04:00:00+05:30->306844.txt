Vadodara: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati will visit Vadodara on September 23 as part of the programme to celebrate the centenary of the Mahasankalp Divas – the day Father of the Indian Constitution Dr B R Ambedkar, vowed to fight inequality. 

 Mayawati is expected to virtually launch the party’s campaign for upcoming assembly polls by addressing a rally at the Kalabhavan Ground. In the afternoon, Mayawati is scheduled to visit Sankalp Bhoomi at Sayajibaug where Ambedkar had vowed to fight inequality in the society.
 
 Gujarat state BSP general secretary Amit Jadav said that preparations were on in a full swing for the visit. He said the main reason for the visit was to pay tributes to Babasaheb on the centenary of the Mahasankalp Divas. “We have contested polls in the state in the past and will continue to do so,” said Jadav.
 
 The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had recently removed a series of hoardings of the party from across the city. Mayawati had last visited the city in 2007 after former BJP minister late Nalin Bhatt had joined the BSP.
