JAIPUR: For several years now, the   problems of the   have defied a lasting solution. The haphazard parking, narrow lanes, regular traffic snarls and encroachments have led to the residents being forced to live in the midst of chaos.

 For city police officials, managing the traffic flow in MI Road,  , Badi Chaupar, Kishanpole Bazaar, Chandpole and Ramganj is equivalent of managing a ‘headache’.
 
 “You feel a sense of disarray the moment you enter into the Walled City. This is because people want to park their cars in front of a shop, even if it leaves the stretch chock-a-block,” said a senior police officer, adding that during festival seasons like Dhanteras, a staggering number of over 400 cops were deployed and yet the inept drivers ensured that traffic plans go for a toss.
 
 While the officials decry motorists failing to empathize with their cause to maintain traffic norms, the people allege lack of parking space is chocking the heritage markets of the Walled City.
 
 R S Prajapati, owner of a stationery shop near Chaura Rasta, said, a proposal was mooted earlier to make streets ‘free vehicle day’ for a one day every week, but nobody seems interested and the idea fizzled out.
 
 “Like Delhi and Gurgaon, we can declare that one day of every week shall be a vehicle-free day. People can use public transport and come to old city markets,” he added.
 
 Chirag Maheshwari, a resident of Kishanpole said, the shopkeepers are equally to be blamed for the traffic problems. “They have encroached upon public roads, pavements and even parking spaces. The stretch which is meant for general public’s parking is being used by them to park their delivery vehicles,” he said, adding that even JDA and JMC have overlooked the problems of the area.
 
 “The JDA could have turned the defunct and vacant nearby plots into parking spaces. They are under the impression that once Metro project takes off in the Walled City, people will leave their vehicles,” he said.
