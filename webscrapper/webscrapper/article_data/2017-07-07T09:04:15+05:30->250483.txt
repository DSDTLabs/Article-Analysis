RANCHI: The   of the  , 36-year old  , who was reported missing since Tuesday evening from a   in Balumath in  , was found dead in a ditch near his project site on Thursday. 

 Local residents Jari Mahuadand Toli saw Samajhdar around 4.30am on Thursday and informed police. The ditch, 20 feet deep, was a few meters away from the camp office of the sub-leased company which was tasked with building a bridge for the 44km-long Tori-Shivpur-Kathautia railway line. 
 
 "The body has been identified as that of Samajhdar's and has been sent for autopsy," Latehar superintendent of police Dhananjay Singh told TOI. "No external injuries have been found," the SP added. 
 
 Originally from Bagodar in Giridih, Samajhdar lived with his family in Hazaribag.
 
 Samajdhar had gone missing from near the camp office on Tuesday evening. The junior engineer's disappearance from Balumath, a known bastion of CPI (Maoists) and its splinter groups located some 130km from Ranchi, had sent the police department into a tizzy. Anticipating a possible abduction for ransom state police chief DK Pandey chaired over a meeting with top cops. 
 
 Soon after the meeting, six teams were formed for search operations in Latehar, Palamu and Chatra districts. Additional forces were deployed into the area on Wednesday night and several places were raided. 
 
 Singh told TOI that preliminary investigation did not point at abduction for money. "The engineer's wallet, mobile phone, ATM card and USB drive were found in his pocket when his body was recovered," he added. 
 
 DIG (Palamu range) Vipul Shukla also backed the claims of Latehar SP and ruled out any involvement of the Left-wing extremists in the death of the engineer. "Besides cases of murder and abduction there is also a possibility of accidental death. We will crack the case," Shukla said.
