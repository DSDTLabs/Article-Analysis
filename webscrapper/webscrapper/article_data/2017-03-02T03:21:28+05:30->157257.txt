NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday staged a “symbolic” demonstration at Delhi   headquarters alleging that the police have been slow in filing the chargesheet on the JNU students charged with sedition in the February 9, 2016 incident. 

 The Right-wing students’ group also carried out a Tiranga march in South Campus on Wednesday, similar to the one conducted in North Campus on February 27.
 
 Since February 21, when violence broke out at   over JNU student   Khalid being invited for a seminar there, ABVP has been in a protest mode. Khalid is one of the three JNU student leaders accused of shouting anti-India slogans.
 
 The students’ group said that they are unhappy with the police’s inaction since the last one year. “Umar Khalid and his friends had shouted seditious slogans at JNU, but the police have refused to file a chargesheet in the case. He should be arrested and thrown behind bars,” said Amit Tanwar, president of DU Students’ Union (DUSU).
 
 Reacting to the news that the investigating officers had given a clean chit to former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar in the sedition case, DUSU ex-president Satinder Awana asked, “Even if he did not shout slogans, why was didn’t he stop the sloganeers?” 
 
 Saurabh Sharma, former JNUSU joint secretary concurred with Awana. “There is a conspiracy to mobilise students. These people should have been arrested to stop similar events from being held. If they had arrested Khalid and the others, the Ramjas incident, where anti-national slogans were shouted, wouldn’t have taken place,” he said.
 
 “There are people who are supporting these traitors. We need the authorities (the government and the police) to act against them,” demanded Sharma. DU saw ABVP get some support after the massive ‘DU against Gundagardi’ protests at the campus on February 28.
