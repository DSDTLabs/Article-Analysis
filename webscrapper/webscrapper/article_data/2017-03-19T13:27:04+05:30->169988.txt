The much-awaited title track of One is out and it's everything we'd hoped for! Smart choreography, crisp editing and good looking men! While Yash does justice to his bit in the song, it is  , really, who is stealing the limelight. The actor plays a baddie in the film and boy does he look good! The Tollywood Badshah always gives his 100% when it comes to a film and we cannot get over his demeanour, handsomeness and physique in the song that has been sung by Bollywood's favourite Vishal Dadlani and rapper Raftaar. Vishal's powerful voice gives the song the attitude it needs and tollywood just got it's new party anthem! 

 
  
  
 
 When we got in touch with Prosenjit about it, the actor couldn't contain his excitement. "I like to break and re-build myself with every film that I do -- be it Shankhachil or Praktan. I play a role with my utmost conviction regardless of the shade of the character. In Baishey Srabon, I had negative shades but I was barely there in the film. A few stray scenes but it stayed with the audience. That's the power of a character. Look at Amitabh Bachchan-- at 74, he can shoulder an entire film like Piku. To site another example, let's look at  . The trailer of   just released.   is in the film in a special appearance but he totally owns the trailer. You cannot stop thinking about him. This is what I aim for.   too played a negative role in   but what an iconic character Mayurvahan is. The idea is to attract the audience with a smart and catchy role. One is urban and has a modern hollywood charm to it. It's a challenging role but then again, I love challenges!" he said.
 
  
  
 
 
 As of now, we cannot stop crushing on our beloved Bumba da. This must be the reason why women are always attracted towards bad boys. They are, almost always, drop-dead handsome!
