TRICHY: Parents of autistic children in the city were taught ways to effectively manage their children through positive energy, as part of world   celebrations at   (SRC) on Monday. 

 Parents were exposed to the aura therapy that deals with balancing the mind, body and soul. While the endurance of parents constantly remain under check, managing autistic children demands a lot of courage and commitment to look after them. 
 
 The idea is to induce positive energy into parents of autistic children as they often find themselves low. The programme was aimed at building self-confidence and positive thinking. 
 
 “There are instances when autistic children are beaten up by their parents in public places when they are unable to manage them,” said  , academic advisor, SRC, adding that the three day workshop will help them learn different ways to effectively handle them.
 
 Appreciating the effort rendered by the college management to organise the programme,  , director of   said, “Our thinking is what reflects in our actions, thus it is important to remain positive. First of all, they should love themselves and love what they do than doing it as sacrifice.” 
 
 “It was indeed a very informative session where parents were taught simple things to keep their children healthy and sound,” she said.
 
 G Seeli, who had come with her 8-year-old child, was skeptical about the event, however, she found it to be informative at the end of the session. “The session on using our inner energy through scientific approach by practising yoga and other exercises was really useful,” said Seeli.
