Pop star   reportedly doesn't want to rush into getting serious with  , who she recently started dating. 

 The thrice-married star has been unlucky in love in the past and doesn't want to rush into her latest romance, reported Hollywood Life.
 
 "She has not been gushing about her new romance to friends or family, and instead has been trying to play it all cool. She wants to keep things between them easy, light and fun," a source said. 
 
 "She knows Drake is a bit of a player, so to help her avoid getting whipped on him, she is trying to take things slow and not put any pressure on him. The last thing Jennifer wants is for Drake to do something to make her look foolish or feel like she has been played." 
 
 Jennifer, 47, has eight-year-old twins Max and Emme with her former husband Marc Anthony and was also previously married to Cris Judd and Ojani Noa. 
 
 She was also engaged to Ben Affleck but they ended their romance in 2002 and she recently split from on/off boyfriend Casper Smart. 
 
 Drake has previously been linked to Serena Williams, Rihanna and Taylor Swift.
