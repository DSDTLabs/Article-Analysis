HYDERABAD: The largest technology-driven blood donation drive, involving 200 blood banks across 18 states, was held on Thursday by the city-based NTR Trust in association with tech giant Facebook. 

 The social networking site had recently launched its 'blood donation feature' supporting the pan-India 'Legendary blood donation drive' of the Trust, which was held across 291 locations in the country, including Hyderabad. This was also the NTR Trust's first national-level drive on a single day and was completely dependent on Facebook's notification feature for spreading the message. 
 
 The drive saw huge participation, with many first-time donors turning up at one of the four blood donation camps in the city. Ragini Misra, 57, was one such donor who read it on Facebook. "I had been wanting to do this for the longest time. Since my first attempt when I was a teenager, I could not donate due to low haemoglobin count. But I have been waiting for an opportunity. Each time my daughter, who is a frequent donor, was contacted by various groups there was need for a particular blood group. Here, I could donate without being concerned about any blood group," Misra said.
 
 Facebook also helped conduct the first-ever blood donation drive across India. "Last year we held a drive across   and AP, but used our individual network to spread awareness. This year, it was totally through Facebook. We have seen remarkable response from blood banks in remote locations in Maharashtra, Sikkim and Meghalaya," said T  , chief executive officer, NTR Trust. 
 
 More than 6 million people signed up as blood donors on Facebook in India, making it the largest online blood registry in the country. "The feature was launched in October to make it easier for people to donate blood and for organizations and people in need to connect with donors," said Hema Budaraju, product manager- Health at Facebook.
