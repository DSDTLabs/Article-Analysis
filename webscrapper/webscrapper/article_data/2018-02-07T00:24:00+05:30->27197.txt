Pune: Hurt by higher provisions for bad loans, the Pune-based Bank of Maharashtra’sQ3 net loss has widened to Rs 597 crore from Rs 182 crore in the year-ago quarter.

 The bank set aside Rs 1,344 crore as a provision against potential bad loans — over twice more than what it did in the year-ago quarter. About Rs 650 crore of this was because of increased provisioning requirement for accounts that have been referred to the National Companies Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
 
 The loss was despite the bank saying that its focus was on recoveries and preventing additional slippages on non-performing assets (NPAs) was yielding result. The bank’s gross NPA, however, increased by Rs 889 crore in the quarter to Rs 18,128 crore. This now represents about 19.05% of the bank’s total advances.
 
 The bank said it managed to recover Rs 388 crore of bad loans in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
 
 Ravindra Marathe, managing director and CEO of the bank, said the fresh slippages are a result of 3-4 large accounts, which have a higher possibility of resolving in the current quarter.
