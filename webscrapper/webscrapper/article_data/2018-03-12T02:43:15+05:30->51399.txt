NEW DELHI: The commuters’ grievances against the   (NHAI)   plaza in   on Delhi-Chadigarh highway has reached the Punjab and Haryana High Court. In a  , a Gurgaon resident has challenged NHAI’s decision to set up the toll plaza, against its earlier order of having no toll collection point within 10km of any municipal or local town area.

 RTI activist Aseem Takyar cited that in December 2008, the government had said that no toll   could be established within 60km from an already existing toll plaza. “There is already a toll plaza at Gharaunda district in Karnal and another toll plaza for Panipat flyover. Now NHAI has established a new toll plaza at at village Bhagan in Murthal, which is in violation of notification dated 05.12.2008,” Takyar has said in his PIL. Hearing on Takyar’s PIL has been adjourned twice.
