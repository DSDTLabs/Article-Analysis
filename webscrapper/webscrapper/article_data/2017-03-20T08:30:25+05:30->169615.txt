LUCKNOW:   ( ) dons want to introspect, and how. They want a   or  , along with spouses, to “introspect” on the shortcomings of the institutes and prepare a roadmap for its growth.

 The idea was mooted by IIM-L director Ajit Prasad and is on the agenda to be discussed at a meeting of the board of governors (BoG) on Monday, ahead of the annual convocation of the institute.
 
 An email, in possession of TOI, sent by the director to the faculty on Feburary 23, reads: “I am planning to have our retreat in Singapore/Pattaya in the first half of May 2017. A valid passport is naturally a must. To negotiate with the airlines and hotel, I need a fix on how many people would be coming. For the spices (spouses), expenditure is likely to be in the range of 4 MDP sessions.”
 
 The three-day meet will discuss the mission, vision, objectives of the institute and will ponder on whether teaching at IIM-L is going the right direction. On day-I, faculty will brainstorm on whether there is a valid (Drucker’s) Theory of Business, based on the theory of Peter F Drucker, American management consultant, educator, and author.
 
 On the second day, the faculty will conduct a course review for its students - is IIML teaching the right stuff to its students. The third and final day will be spent in deliberating on the future and frontiers at the horizon, and that whether the institute needs to turn left or right.
 
 Sources revealed that the verbal discussion on the retreat was presented to the BoG in the last meeting held on February 18 where it was turned down. The BoG later asked the director to present a formal proposal.
