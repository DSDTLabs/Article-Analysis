AGRA: Students of   (AMU) commenced their relay hunger strike on Saturday to demand the arrest of right-wing activists involved in a fracas at the campus gate on May 2 over the portrait of MA   installed at the university.
 
  AMU Students’ Union (AMUSU) had on Friday night announced that students would go on a hunger strike in pursuance of their demand. Vice-president of the union, Sajjad Subhan Rather, along with a few students, was in the first batch to commence the relay hunger strike on Saturday afternoon.
  
  Talking to TOI, president of AMUSU, Maskoor Ahmad Usmani said, “The strike will be called off when all our demand are met. These include withdrawal of all cases lodged against the students, merger of all complaints into a FIR to make out strict charges against right-wing activists and a judicial inquiry into the alleged conspiracy of an attack on former vice president of India, Hamid Ansari, on the campus.”
  
  The students have also demanded suspension of police officers involved in allegedly shielding the activists.
  
  Meanwhile, the union has written separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath demanding action against right-wing activists for “tarnishing the reputation of the educational institution by engineering the controversy” over the removal of Jinnah’s portrait.
  
  AMUSU has asked the state and Centre to clear the air over the matter and take action against those who allegedly tried to enter the campus and were involved in an “unprovoked attack” on students. The union stated, “The idea of a university is to allow free flow of ideas and discussion on diverse issues. This is being resisted by the growing intolerance brigade.”
  
  “The denial of the constitutional right to protest by use of excessive force against innocent students is deplorable. Your (PM and CM) utter silence on such attacks and failure to, at the very least, condemn them is disappointing,” the letter read.
