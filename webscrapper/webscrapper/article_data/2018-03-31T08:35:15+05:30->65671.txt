LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party on Friday launched a massive social media campaign to target chief minister   for inaugurating six-lane elevated road in  . With a tagline " Ram naam japna, paraya kaam apna," the campaign highlighted how the UP CM was inaugurating development projects actually started by the SP government. 

 This is not the first time that the SP reacted strongly to Yogi inaugurating a project that was started by the   government, be it the inauguration of   train, the Magenta Line extension of   in National Capital Region (NCR) in December 2017 or the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. 
 
 Interestingly, the trial run of Lucknow Metro and the Expressway had been inaugurated by   himself as CM during the SP regime but their formal commercial launch took place after Yogi Adityanath became the UP chief minister in March 2017.
 
 On Thursday online campaign's tagline " Ram naam japna, paraya kaam apna," was tweeted by none other than the party president Akhilesh Yadav himself around the time the CM inaugurated the elevated road project in Ghaziabad on Friday. 
 
 The message also quoted his another tweet dated August 12, 2016 wherein he wrote "To help ease traffic in Ghaziabad we commissioned this elevated road which is over 9 km long and completing fast."
