TRICHY: Seven people including policemen of the   I Battalion were injured when a canteen functioning in an old building inside the battalion's campus here collapsed after a water   dashed against the weak structure on Friday. 

 The driver of the tanker lorry loaded with water was reversing the vehicle near the canteen when seven persons were inside the building around 11 am. Suddenly, the lorry hit the front of the building bringing the entire tiled-roof structure to the ground in a few seconds, sources said. All the seven people including policemen Senthilkumar, 30, Vijayakumar, 25, Sivanesan, 28, cook Sundaram, 45, and sanitary worker Thangamani, 55 came under the debris. As they struggled to come out, the other policemen on the campus came to their rescue. They removed the broken tiles and wooden reapers which fell on them and admitted the injured to the  . 
 
 "None of them had severe injuries. They had scratches and are being provided treatment," said commandant of TSP I Battalion SN Umayal. Sources said that when the incident took place, cooking of food for the policemen on the gas stove was on. Fortunately, the policemen were quick enough to disconnect the LPG cylinder from the stove and take it out. 
 
 It is learnt that the building had been originally constructed for some other purpose in 1917 after which it went through renovation and was converted to a canteen. Since then, it has been functioning as one of the canteens inside the battalion campus offering food to the policemen at concessional price three times a day. 
 
 The weak structure was said to be one of the reasons for the building to collapse entirely as it could not resist even a small impact. The campus has several such weak structures which were being used by the policemen. When asked if they were being renovated, commandant Umayal said they would take it up one by one.
