PALANPUR: Radhanpur town remained tense following   of two religions after a woman was allegedly   on Sunday.

 At least three shops were vandalized and mobs resorted to stone pelting. Police said that the five people started stalking the 34-year-old woman when she was on way to get fodder for her goats. One of them snatched her dupatta and even tried to tear her clothes. When her husband tried to stop them, he was hit in the head with a sharp farming equipment. The man was rushed to Dharpur hospital in Patan for treatment. 
 
 Shopkeepers immediately downed their shutters as soon as the news of rioting spread and the town wore a deserted look. Patan superintendent of police   said that additional police force has been deployed in the town to avert escalation of tension. 
 
 Radhanpur police inspector NR Patel said that patrolling has been intensified in the town and the situation is under control. “We are searching for the accused persons who molested the woman,” said Patel.
