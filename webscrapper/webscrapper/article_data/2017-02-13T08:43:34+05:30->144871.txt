AHMEDABAD: The ambitious   for Ahmedabad city is yet to be   in spirit.

 Since April 1 last year every government department, including municipal corporations were to provide a list of services and its time bound delivery by the government departments. 
 
 The Gujarat (Right of Citizens to Public Services) Act, 2013 is in force since April last year, but the government bodies like the   (AMC) are yet to notify citizens a list of time bound delivery of services. The issue was brought to the light by an   activist from Kalupur, Pankaj Bhatt. “Each of the government departments was to come out with a list of time bound services within two months of the notification last year. But this has not been done as per an RTI reply given to me, “ says Bhatt.
 
 The Act requires every public authority to, within two months from the date of a notification specifying the services to which the Act shall apply, publish the names and addresses of the individuals responsible for rendering the notified services. 
 
 “It was only after my RTI that the first office circulars were issued by various departments. This only shows how serious are the government departments about the act,” says Bhatt.
