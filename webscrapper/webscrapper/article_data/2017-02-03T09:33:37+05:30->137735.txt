MANALI: A tourist from Haryana, who had gone missing in snow-covered hills near Manali on Wednesday, was rescued by local police and mountaineers.

 Abhishek, who has recently been selected as an officer in the custom and excise department, decided to go for a hike on the outskirts of Manali all by himself. After climbing for more than four hours when he decided to descend, he got lost amid snow. As he was trying to find a safe place to rest in bone chilling cold as darkness was setting in, he found that his cell phone was working.
 
 Abhishek then searched phone number of   (DSP)   and called him up. “I was shocked to receive the phone call. Initially it was not clear to me that whether the person calling me is in distress or it’s s prank,” Raghu said. Realizing that a life can be under real threat, Raghu asked Abhishek to send his GPS location and panoramic view of the area through WhatsApp. 
 
 “When I received photo, I got to know that it is somewhere above Chachoga village of Manali. A team of police and local mountaineers was dispatched immediately to locate him,” the DSP added.
 
 The team was able to find Abhishek, who was then brought down to Chachoga village. The rescue team ascertained that he was not suffering from frostbite after a proper medical examination. Sources said that Abhishek admitted that he was climbing the mountainous region to test his stamina.
 
 According to rescue team officials, if Abhishek’s phone was not working, the situation might have turned fatal for him as he was not prepared for the chilling temperature of night that can dip as low as minus 10°C. 
 
 Earlier also many tourists have been rescued from the mountains of Himachal Pradesh while some were not be saved. Not hiring a local guide and losing way in the mountains are the main reasons of such accidents.
