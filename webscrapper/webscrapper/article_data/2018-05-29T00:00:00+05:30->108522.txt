The wedding reception of director   (of Rangoon fame) and   J was attended by several celebrities from the film industry. The couple looked splendid in their reception outfits. While Rajkumar chose a dark blue suit, Jaswini looked pretty in a bronze-red lehenga. Actors Simbu and Sivakarthikeyan, directors AR Murugadoss, Atlee and Vignesh ShivN attended the wedding reception. Since Rajkumar had previously worked in a television channel before he set out to make films, a lot of his television friends, too, were there throughout the ceremony. Dhivyadharshini and Ramya even welcomed many of the guests and took them to the stage.
