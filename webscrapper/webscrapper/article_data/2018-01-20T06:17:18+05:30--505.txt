HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate sleuths have taken possession of two villas belonging to the family of   founder B   in   Aparna Palm Meadows in Gundlapochampally and also initiated process of taking possession of 145 acres belonging to the Rajus.

 The two villas each costing around 4-5 crore were sealed with the help of Medchal revenue and police on Friday. Around 145 acres of agriculture land in Vemavaram and Anuru villages, Thadongi Mandal, East Godavari, will also be taken into possession in connection with the   scam as investigations by ED found that crime proceeds went into these properties.
 
 The ED issued provisional attachment orders on March 30, 2010, under the Prevention of   Act and the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachments on July 21, 2010. Taking possession of the properties got delayed as tenants living in the villas moved the High Court and secured a stay. In October 2017, the HC dismissed the petitions thus paving the way for the ED to take possession of the properties.
 
 ED joint director S A   issued orders on Friday prohibiting sale or transfer or mortgage of the property. ED initially attached 250 crore worth of properties and later in 2012 attached FDs worth 833 crore. One villa with a built up area of 4,500 sq ft on 7,650-sq feet of plot number 48 in   owned by B Teja Raju, Ramalinga Raju's son. The HC had dismissed the plea of R Gajapati Kumar Raju who petitioned against eviction stating he was a tenant. The other villa with 4,500 square feet built-up area in 6,300-sq ft plot number 58 is owned by B  , another son of Raju. HC also dismissed the plea of D Rajesh in the case. Similarly, the petition of one K Annapurna Kumar was also rejected.
