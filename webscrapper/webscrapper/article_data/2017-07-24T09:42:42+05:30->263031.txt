VISAKHAPATNAM: With the concept of eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi gaining popularity in the city, NGOs are coming forward to keep the age old tradition of using ‘patri leaves’ alive.

 After the 42-day campaign by   (PMV) to create awareness on the use of eco-friendly idols kick-started recently, people are being sensitised to use clay idols. “Each of the 21 types of patri seeds are used for worshipping Lord Ganesha. Apart from keeping the tradition alive, clay idols will help in reducing the pollution levels,” said veteran film actor   on Sunday.
 
 PMV secretary J Rajeswari said, “We have collected all varieties of native seeds and use them while making clay idols. These idols are kept in pots and they transform into plants on pouring a bucket of water.” She also added that seeds of medicinal plants are also being inserted in the clay mould which can be reused for gardening purpose.
 
  is an important puja which is done during Ganesh Chaturthi. Twenty-one types of leaves are used to worship Lord Ganesha during the festival. This puja is also called as ‘Eka Vimshathi Patra’ Puja. Chanting each name of the Lord, Ganesha is worshipped with each type of leaf.
