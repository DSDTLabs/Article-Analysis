ZIRAKPUR: A triple trap on the single-lane   road almost killed a driver here on Sunday. His car hit an open gutter first and then a tree before knocking down an electricity pole and bending another.

 The tree and the gutter are almost in the middle of the road near the Savitry Green-2 apartments, with electricity poles nearby. An eyewitness confirmed that the   car had lost its balance where road is uneven over the manhole and, 15 minutes later, a construction truck passing by the spot and dragged the fallen electricity transmission cable along. The gutter and the tree have narrowed the single-lane road further.
 
 Manoj Das of Savitry Green-2 complained that since the accident, there is no electricity in the area, because the transmission poles were damaged. Residents of various residential societies on this road said time and again they had been given assurance that the administration would remove these poles but, so far, nothing had been done. The road is 60-foot wide on paper but reduced to 20 feel because of a delay in land acquisition.
 
 TOI found another spot with three trees in the middle of the old Ambala Kalka road, which have led to many accidents in the area. S K Vadhawan, executive member of the confederation of the   resident welfare associations said that a major accident near this spot had claimed two lives but, even after that, the authorities concerned had turned a blind eye to the issue. Confederation’s legal secretary   said: “At night, the risk of accident multiplies, as there is no streetlight in the area and the drivers spot the tree almost too late. Even the regular commuters also face a similar risk of accident because of the tree.” Roads in Zirakpur are in a dilapidated condition and people are facing harassment due to it. They say the MC officials are not at all taking the matter seriously.
