CHENNAI: A search by the   (DRI) and the customs officials for   stalled   at the   for a second day on Sunday. The operation is also underway at other ports in the state.

 The officials began the checks in the morning at 11am and continued till 7pm but were unable to find the shipments of fake notes that they believe suspects in Pakistan sent to India by a container via the Chennai port.
 
 The operation was painstaking, with the officials initially combing every container from Pakistan and Bangladesh that landed in Chennai. They later started checks of containers from   and Nepal also and this contributed to additional delays and long queues of containers at freight stations.
 
 The officials will continue the checks on Monday. They will wind up the operation only once they check the last container from these four countries that landed in the Chennai port within a given period, a senior customs official said.
 
 There are 32 container freight stations (CFS) in Chennai port, where officials stack containers with import and export goods. The officials clear around 400 containers from the CFS every day. On average, each CFS clears 10 containers a day. Some freight stations are larger and clear up to 20 a day, the official said.
 
 The officials suspect that one of the containers contains the contraband.
 
 Importers fretted about the number of containers stranded at the Chennai port and their consignments being held up, sources said, adding that officials cleared consignments of freight for export.
