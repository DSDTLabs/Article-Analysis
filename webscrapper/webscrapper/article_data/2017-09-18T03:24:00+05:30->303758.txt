Panaji: More than 1,850 students from 26 higher secondary schools across Goa opted for the ‘financial literacy programme’ offered from 2015 by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. The programme has seen 99% of the students, who opted for it, clear the exam of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Academy. The Goa Board has now decided to continue the course, according to a new circular issued this month. The NSE Academy of the National Stock Exchange of India, Mumbai, has developed the textbook for the programme, which is being offered to Class XI and Class XII students in Goa. The NSE had begun offering the programme from 2014, when it tied up with five education boards in states across the country. Goa joined the programme a year later. In Goa, teachers from higher secondary schools were trained by experts from the NSE. Initially, 40 teachers were trained on a priority basis. The Board has now said that the response has been ‘overwhelming and encouraging’ for the self-financed course, where students pay a fee of Rs 400. Students have to answer the test online and successful students are issued certificates by NSE. The objective of the NSE Academy is to encourage students to take up a career in finance, by offering them, skill-based courses in Class XI and Class XII under ‘vocational elective’ and thus help create a skilled manpower for the financial sector. The course covers subjects like the financial markets, primary and secondary markets, stock exchanges and the securities market in India, analysis of financial statements, market index and trading among other financial learnings.
