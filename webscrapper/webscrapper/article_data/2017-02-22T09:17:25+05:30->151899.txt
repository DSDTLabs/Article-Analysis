ALLAHABAD: Exactly halfway through the seven-phase elections in UP, and there's still no perceptible wave for any party or combine. With no clear frontrunner in sight, the game remains open. 

 It will be a hard-fought battle in the fourth round when 12 districts vote on February 23, among them Allahabad, which with 12 seats, leads the UP districts in terms of assembly constituencies. 
 
 The generals are here for one last shot at wooing voters. PM Narendra Modi held a rally in Phulpur on Monday. Rahul Gandhi reached Monday night for a road show with  . After a late decision,   too is in town for a big campaign blitz. In all this, the BSP's silence is jarring as the 12 Allahabad seats hold out hope for almost every party at the moment. If the SP has an edge in three, Congress looks to be in with a good chance in at least two and BSP is strong in three.
 
  BJP is on a strong pitch in at least three of the 12 seats. Its best seats seem to be those where SP and BSP both have put up Muslim nominees and are splitting the minority vote. Case in point: Allahabad-South, where BJP's Nand Gopal Gupta looks a step ahead. Though SP's Haji Pervez Tanki is a strong contestant, BSP's Aneesh Ahmed is snapping at his heels, locals say. 
 
 While the campaign has polarised, especially with the BJP raising the communal bogey, it remains to be seen if the SP-Congress falls into the trap or chooses to avoid it. So far, the attempt is to ignore the provocation, evident from the party first mulling to go to EC against PM Modi's Sunday speech invoking the Hindu-Muslim element, then dropping the idea so it doesn't become the talking point in the remaining phases.
