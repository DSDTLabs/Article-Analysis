AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad crime branch on Wednesday arrested  , 43, an accused in the 2002 Gulbarg massacre case, from Narol. Pande was absconding for 16 years after the FIR was lodged and had been hiding in several states including Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.

 DCP-crime branch Deepan Bhadran said Pande, who used to live in Krishnanagar, had fled the state after the Gulbarg massacre, in which 69 people including   MP Ehsan Jafri were killed.
 
 “After fleeing Gujarat, Pande first went to Roorkee in Uttarakhand and began working at a transport company. From Roorkee he went to Haridwar and then to Madhya Pradesh. He worked in transport companies at all these places and occasionally came to the city to meet his family,” said a crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch sources said Pande had returned to the city and settled in Narol around two years ago. “Here too, he worked for a transport company and lived with his family in a flat,” said a crime branch official.
 
 On Wednesday, PSI J S Jadeja, acting on a tip-off, arrested Pande from his house in Narol. “We have handed over the accused to the special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Supreme Court to probe nine cases of 2002 post-Godhra communal violence,” said a police source.
 
 SIT officials said they have taken custody of the accused from city crime branch. “As Pande has been absconding since the incident, we will seek his remand. We have to conduct a test identification parade of Pande as well,” said a senior SIT official.
 
 In its verdict in the Gulbarg massacre case, the Special SIT court convicted 24 accused and sentenced 11 to life imprisonment while acquitting 36. The SIT is yet to appeal against the acquittal of the accused and for enhancement of punishment of those convicted in the case.
