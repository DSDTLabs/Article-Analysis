NEW DELHI: Police were put on high alert after residents of an apartment in Dwarka reported about three   flying a   from their terrace on Sunday afternoon. Following this, a police team detained two men and a woman from   who were working for an insurance company in Delhi.

 Teams from the central intelligence agencies and Delhi Police Special Cell were called to jointly interrogate them, during which it was found that they worked for a UK-based insurance company which also had a branch in Delhi that was in collaboration with two government banks. The company had employed them to survey the area with a drone in order to realise the insurance claims of a woman, whose husband had passed away recently.
 
 The two men, Jasyu Antony and Seth Zwerostine, told police that they were flying the drone to locate the womanâ€™s house and verify some of her claims on behalf of the insurance company.
 
 Police said that they were booked under Section 188 IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) since flying of drones was banned by Delhi Police ahead of the   celebrations.
