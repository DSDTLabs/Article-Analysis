An investigative thriller plotted around the 1997 communal riots that happened in Coimbatore, which eventually led to the serial bomb blasts that rocked the city in 1998, leaving at least 58 dead and over 200 injured, is gearing up for release. 

 The film, titled Thelivuppathaiyin Neesa Thooram ( ) is a crowd-funded independent Tamil film, directed by Coimbatore-based filmmaker Aravind. The film stars veteran actress Rohini, Madhubaanakadai director Kamalakannan, Sarthar and Raguram. Music is by   and Sre Ram Anand and the script is by Gnatppan Siva, Sarthar, Prabakar Shanmugam and Aravind. The teaser of the film was released recently and has piqued the curiosity of the Coimbatore audience.
 
 Aravind, the director of the TNT, tells us, ���The movie presents the chronology of events that led to the communal riot and how the plotters of the crime escaped from the law. We have been working on the film for the last three years, and have spent around two years investigating the issue. We were a small team and had to keep our entire journey under wraps. We met the victims of communal tension, bomb blasts, activists and advocates. We revisited the FIR reports, commission reports and cross examinations. There were instances when we conducted our own sting operations and went undercover. The journey is captured in the film, which has been shot using a spy cam. The film shows three journalists, who are on a mission to expose the conspiracies behind the incidents and collect unbiased truths.���
