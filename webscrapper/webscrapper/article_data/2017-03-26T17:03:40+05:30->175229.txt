A little birdie tell us,   lovebirds   and   are in Bangkok shooting for a commercial together. It's only recently that both have been making numerous public appearances together sending fans in a tizzy as to what their relationship status is. The duo walked in together at the   2017 and happily posed for shutterbugs. Their social media timelines too speak volumes of their close friendship. 

  
  
 
 In an interview with us back in 2016, the model-turned actress had said, "I am Dev's absolute best friend. No time, distance, space or human being can ever change that between us. And Dev knows that only too well.What is the one thing you like about Dev? That he is a very sorted person within. I know him since I was 17.We met through mutual friends. At that point of time, I didn't even know that he was an actor. And then we lost touch. And when we got back in touch, I had no idea he was so big here. He would tell me, `You know, I have done pretty well for myself!' and I would be like, `Ok, nice. So have I!'
