Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner   is busy giving finishing touches to the mega show a day away. He tells Neha Lalchandani how the government changed the perception of UP in the eyes of investors and how it is planning to tap UP’s potential. Excerpts…

 
 
 
 • We are simplifying processes, bringing in technology, professionals and introducing new areas for investments. For instance, we planned to introduce electric vehicles and we will introduce policy on these and have them start operating in NCR soon. The cabinet also cleared a biofuel policy, making UP the first state to do so. We have so much biomass and complain about agricultural fires. Now, we already have   worth Rs 8,000 crore in this sector. While Haryana and   keep burning their agri waste and Delhi has to deal with high pollution, UP will take the lead in processing this waste. UP is also the first state to come out with a logistics policy. We are going to make a mega logistics hub at Dadri which will be as big as Noida. It will be like a dry port with container depot, facility for documentation. We are linked to the Delhi-Mumbai and   industrial corridors and have a dedicated freight corridor which will make transportation much easier.
 
 
 
 
 • We have competitive advantage over China, where wages have risen and the country is getting less competitive in production.UP is not just offering a 220 million strong manpower but also ease of doing business, infrastructure, governance reforms and law and order. In a short while, people will forget about China and UP will become a factory. There are lots of people from UP who have invested in other states and we are trying to bring them back. Our outreach has been national so far and the next stage is global.
 
 
 
 • A few months ago, even general managers of top industries would not respond to us. Now all the top guns of India Inc are attending the summit. When we went for roadshows, many did not show interest. We tried reaching out to people through our contacts, writing letters. We even got the CM to speak to some.
 
 Now, ITC is investing in UP. When we went to Kolkata, they said nobody would attend. Then I called ITC CEO Sanjiv Puri’s office and said my minister and I wanted to meet. We asked him for his plans and told him about our policies. He was planning to invest in Jhajjar in Haryana but now he is investing in Unnao. He came to Lucknow and met the CM. Now he is planning to set up a mega food park.
 
 
 
 
 • There are several MoUs we have signed which have no material value but which will be highly beneficial in the long run. For instance, we have signed an MoU with IL&FS for the Metro. Why should we go running around to find people for investment in this field when a company like IL&FS has experience in this field. Someone has pledged Rs 27,000 crore for investment in smart cities. Then there is additional investment in startups. IIT Kanpur is our startup partner and we are expecting huge funds to come in. We have also targeted   in a large way. Indian Oil, GAIL will be expanding in the state.
 
 
 
 
 • UP is the largest market for pharmaceuticals but its potential is largely unexplored. We have the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow, the biggest such institute of its kind. We also have the National Botanical Research Institute and Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. With such great institutes, why do we need to import from elsewhere.UP can become a huge hub for pharma and we intend setting up a big pharma park in the state.
 
 
 
 
 • The market for locally produced goods is unorganised. Brass production is down while Chinhat potters have had to shut shop. We have a great stock of local handicraft and thought we should promote it. Under ODOP, we will design and promote their products, help them get funds under the Mudra Yojna, create a portal for them to advertise on, help them display at Shilpgram in Lucknow, send them for exhibitions in India and abroad and promote dignity of labour.
