Rajkot: The tax branch of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) recovered Rs 4.71 crore as property tax on Thursday taking the total tax collection to Rs 255 crore, beating its own revised target of Rs 230 crore for 2016-17. The civic body also tightened the noose on defaulters a day before the end of current financial year.

 “Till now, we have collected Rs 255 crore as property tax for 2016-17,” said an official of the RMC. A total of 2.87 lakh citizens paid their taxes this year. Interestingly, many opted to pay their taxes online. “Over 50,000 tax payers paid over Rs 28 crore property dues online. RMC has promoted online payments and people are opting for it,” said an RMC official.
 
 “Earlier, the target for property tax collection for 2016-17 was Rs 205 crore, but later it was revised to Rs 230 crore. However, now we are expecting collection of over Rs 260 crore,” said an RMC official. The jump in tax collection is the result of RMC’s one-time settlement scheme and the civic body’s decision to accept scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for payment of taxes post-demonetization.
 
 “Post demonetization, RMC recovered Rs 50 crore as people rushed to pay taxes in scarped currency. Also, RMC received around Rs 57 crore under the one-time settlement scheme,” said an RMC official.
 
 Friday is the last day of current financial year and RMC hopes that it will recover over Rs 5 crore.
