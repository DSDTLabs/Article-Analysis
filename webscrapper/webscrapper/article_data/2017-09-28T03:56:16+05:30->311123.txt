Mumbai: The 34-year-old   of a   committed suicide 10 days after he complained to   that some   were harassing and threatening him for defaulting though he had paid 10 times the actual loan amount.

 Ajay Yadav, a BJP worker from Dutt Mandir Road, was found hanging in his farsan mart at Vakola in Santacruz (E) on Tuesday afternoon. Yadav is survived by his parents, wife and three children. He was the only son of Baliram Yadav, who is in shock but has pledged to ensure justice for his son.
 
 Though police did not find any suicide note, Baliram, who runs few farsan shops in the vicinity, alleged that three moneylenders compelled his son to commit suicide. Ajay had filed a complaint with Vakola police on September 18, marking copies to senior police officers, including the police commissioner.
 
 TOI has a copy of the letter which has an endorsement dated September 18, in which he said he had taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh in 2011to buy a shop and paid almost Rs 60 lakh in interest. He named Dinkar, Babloo and Pappu, from whom he had taken a loan. Despite paying the principal amount and interest, they were harassing and threatening him to pay more, he had claimed. He had stated that his Scorpio was forcibly taken away by Dinkar.
 
 “I knew he was under pressure. I tried to convince him to open up but he did not share anything. I learnt that some moneylenders were harassing him. On September 23, Dinkar had come to my shop and asked about Ajay. When my servant told him he was not there, he abused and threatened him, saying he will teach Ajay a lesson, and then left. We have CCTV footage as evidence,” Baliram said. He said that if police had acted on his son’s letter, the incident could have been avoided.
 
 Police have registered an accidental death report and are probing the death, senior inspector Kailash Avhad said.
