THANE: Two stationary auto-rickshaws were   after a massive   snapped and collapsed on them late on Thursday evening in Kausa’s Shimla Park area.

 Officials said that the owners of the auto richshaws, Alkhalaque Nisari and Ahmed Ali, had parked their rickshaws near the Kausa Talao and were in the vicinity when the incident took place.
 
 Blocking one side of the road, the uprooted trees caused traffic congestion for nearly 10 to 15 minutes. The fire brigade was informed who reached the spot and cleared the road for traffic. The officials from the regional disaster management cell, too, reached the spot and began clearing away the broken branches.
 
 “Both the rickshaws were severely damaged due to the tree fall incident. Thankfully, the rickshaw drivers were not sitting inside else it could have even proved to be fatal. The area was cleared and situation was resolved in around half an hour,” said a civic official. 
 
 Nearly 190 trees have collaped in the last month due to weakening of roots thanks to concretisation around their trunks or roots. On an average approximately six trees fall daily in the monsoons.
