HYDERABAD: The sharp rise in temperature has caught people unaware, but more alarming than the heat is the number of dubious messages doing the rounds. 

 Over the last two weeks, people have been receiving messages which warn them against stepping out in the sun. To add credence to statement, the source of the warning is said to be the   (IMD). Not only are people asked to stay indoors, but the temperature is falsely said to have crossed 48 degrees Celsius! 
 
 One of the messages circulating on social networking platforms states: "  has issued a RED alert for three days, where the mean temperatures would be between 45.1 degrees Celsius and 48.5 degrees Celsius."
 
 Officials from the IMD said they have not issued any such warning for the city, as yet. "The temperature in the city, can never reach such a level. Only if the heatwave is pervasive till May-end, can we see temperatures rise to 45 degrees Celsius, but as of now it is not possible," said  , a senior scientist with the Met department. "People should not pay heed to such rumours at all," he said.
 
 The message also says that people should drink at least six to seven litres of water per day. Dismissing the claims, city doctors, quoting the  , say six litres of water can kill a 74kg person. They also say that drinking too much water causes a condition called hyponatremia - where the body has abnormally low-level of sodium concentration in blood due to high intake of water. 
 
 Severe cases of hyponatremia can lead to water intoxication, with its main symptoms including headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, frequent urination and mental disorientation. The   commissioner B  , said the civic body has not sent any alert either. "We have not issued any weather warning to people. We have not issued any kind of red alert for the next three days. When the weather forecast says the weather is extreme, we ask people to stay inside, but never predict weather," Reddy said.
