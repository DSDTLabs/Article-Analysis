 Mumbai: Fears about India’s worsening fiscal situation and the US Federal Reserve’s plans to start cutting its over $4-trillion book spooked   players on Friday. As a result, there were no buyers for Rs 4,755 crore worth of   during the day’s auction. This was nearly a third of the Rs 15,000-crore gilts which the RBI auctioned as part of the government’s annual process to borrow from the market. 
 
 RBI data showed that of the Rs 8,000 crore offered for gilts maturing in 2031, papers worth Rs 3,840 crore remained unsold, or ‘devolved’ on primary dealers in market parlance. In addition, another Rs 916 crore worth of gilts maturing in the year 2022 also  . The last time there was a   in a gilts auction was on April 13 this year, RBI data showed.
 
 “Hawkish comments from the US Fed chairman in the context of a pause in the balance sheet reduction process had negatively impacted market sentiment,” said a dealer with a domestic bond house. “Against this backdrop, the sovereign ratings downgrade of China and indication of growth-supportive measures by the Indian government at the cost of fiscal prudence further worsened the negative sentiment,” the dealer added. The bearish sentiment also led to strong selling in the government   market with the benchmark yield on the 10-year paper spiking to 6.66% — a three-month high.
