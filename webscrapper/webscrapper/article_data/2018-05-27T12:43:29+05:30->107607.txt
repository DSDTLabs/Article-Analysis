Ure jaak, sung by Anupam Roy from the film Uma, was launched   depicts the struggle of a fallen film director, Brahmananda, played by Anjan Dutt. “Ure jaak is a very old song. I wrote this song in 2007 for my girlfriend who happens to be my wife now. In 2012, I used this song in my first album too, but not many people had heard it then. I am happy with the way Srijit da has used the song in Uma and more happy that my song is reaching out to so many people now,” said Anupam. Talking about Anjan Dutt’s character, the director shared, “Once renowned and sought-after, Brahmananda (Anjan) is a mess now with alcohol being his only friend. For him, cinema is everything and what he chooses to build for 8 year old terminally ill child, Uma, is his best creation. He finally found a reason to fight a battle and his own too, in the process. The audience will see his past in the flashback sequences and his present in the song, Ure jaak. The latter is being dominated by a little girl's dream. Once a defeated man, will Brahmananda rise from his ashes to become what he never had the courage to be? This is what the film will show alongside Uma’s emotional journey.” Director Srijit said, “Anjan da’s character plays a pivotal role in Uma. The film is not only about Uma herself and her father Himadri, but also very much about this director who helps create a fictional world for a child.”
