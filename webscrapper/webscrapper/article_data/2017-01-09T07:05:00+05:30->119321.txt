PHAGWARA: With Congress expected to release its final list in a few days, leaders of Valmiki-Mazahabi community have asked partyâ€™s state president, Captain  , to ensure that tickets from at least four of the eight reserved seats in Doaba region were given to members of the community.

 In a meeting held here on Sunday, community leaders from Phagwara, Jalandhar, Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurtjhala, Kartarpur and Bholath reminded Amarinder that he had promised the community at a rally in   last year that its interests would be taken care of by giving its members fair representation in assembly polls. In a joint statement issued after the meeting, the leader said the Congress had fallen short of its promises in the allotment of tickets so far, and this was causing widespread resentment in the community.
 
 Central Valmiki Sabha Punjab president Satish Salhotra and   president Joginder Singh Tiger were among the leaders who spoke to journalists after the meeting. Both thebodies are aligned with the Congress.
 
 They argued that though SAD and AAP had allotted tickets to the community in Doaba, the Congress had not yet announced a single candidate from the community in the region where it is in large numbers. Aspirants whose names were mentioned by them included former minister  , who is considered a front-runner for ticket from Phagwara and had represented the constituency thrice in the past.
 
 They added that the Sham Chaurasi and Adampur tickets should also be given to a member of the community.
