PANAJI: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) plans to erect a 52m-high bungee jumping platform near   Lake by September-end as part of the theme park that the government has planned. 

 The government owns prime land near the lake and may later establish an 80-room resort through public private partnership.
 
 The moves, said GTDC chairman  , are a step to promote hinterland tourism and create employment in the mining-affected belt.
 
 “The bungee jumping tower will be the second highest in India, and will be part of the beautiful theme park that we have planned,” Cabral said. “The theme park is our focus and not the hotel. We will start the starred hotel after the theme park is ready.”
 
 Cabral made the statements after meeting representatives from Mayem village. The villagers of Bhatwadi, Mayem, submitted a representation to tourism minister   and Cabral seeking rehabilitation of the owners of stalls which were shifted from the  . “During the tenure of the earlier government, the stalls were asked to be moved. At that time, the deputy speaker, Anant Shet, had assured us that we would be rehabilitated,” former Mayem sarpanch Subhash Kinalkar said. “The MLA has assured us of his help.”
 
 Cabral has agreed to rehabilitate the displaced stall operators, but has said that only genuine stall operators would be given slots to sell their wares and on the condition that they pay the requisite fees.
 
 “I have asked them to submit a list within two days and then we will scrutinize that list,” Cabral said.
 
 Kinalkar also appealed to GTDC to give locals preference for employment in the proposed theme park and other contract works. Cabral said that the villagers’ demands were valid and agreed to resolve their grievances.
