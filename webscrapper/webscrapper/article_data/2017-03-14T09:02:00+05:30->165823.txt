KOCHI: Sam Zachariah, Mishel's elder brother is pained when he says that there was a   when a   in a moving vehicle. “The entire film industry and intellectuals rose in unison to register their protest. The police went out of their way to trace the culprits. But when it happened to an ordinary girl, where are the voices? Why aren't the big names in the industry talking about women security?“ he asked.

 From the time the police told that Mishel had committed suicide, the family lost their peace of mind. “My daughter is a strong girl.She will not commit suicide,“ said  , her father.
 
 Recalling the incidents on March 5, the parents immediately left for Ernakulam after receiving the warden's call that their daughter had not returned back to the hostel.
 
 A family friend, who had helped set up  's in different places in the city, offered to trace the visuals in front of the church. “She had informed that she wouldn't come home this weekend. Mishel informed the warden that she was going to Kaloor church. We are not questioning police motives. But we are upset by the attitude of the ones at the station who bluntly told us at 11pm to come back the next day to file a complaint because the SI had left for the day. When we requested them to trace her mobile, they said that the password was with the SI,“ said Zachariah.
 
 If an ordinary citizen goes to the police station seeking help, this is not the way to respond.“The police have to be ready to help. Where will the citizen go? The only reason why we decided to find out more was because of the attitude of the police which had written off the case as suicide. We couldn't believe it,“ said Fr Elias who is leading #JusticeforMishel campaign.
