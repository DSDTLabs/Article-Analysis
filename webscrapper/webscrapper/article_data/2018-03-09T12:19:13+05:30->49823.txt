NASHIK: The officials and employees of the MSEDCL can now lodge power theft complaints at five police stations in Nashik district as the one police station per zone norm has been scrapped. 

 The move will help the power utility in efficient registration of cases and better and faster investigation. 
 
 Earlier, the MSEDCL staff from Ahmednagar, Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon districts could file cases only at one police station raised at   office. All these districts were part of Nashik Zone till 2010, after which   was carved out with Dhule and   as its constituents. 
 
 A senior official of MSEDCL, Nashik zone, said that earlier, all the cases of power thefts were to be registered at Nashik only and this would prove costly in terms of time and travel. 
 
 "Now, the home department has decided that the special police stations will be shut down and instead complaints will be allowed at certain select police stations in the district," said the official. 
 
 As such the government has designated 132 police stations across the state, instead of six that were existing before, to register power theft cases. 
 
 Besides Nashik, Ahmednagar district will have four police stations, followed by Dhule (three), Jalgoan (four) and Nandurbar (three). This means, 24 police stations instead of one in Nashik revenue division. Similarly, Kolhapur district will have two and   five police stations. 
 
 The MSEDCL has now increased its action against power thefts and the allocation of new police stations will only boost the morale of its staff," added the official of the power utility.
