PANAJI: In an effort to provide alternative fish source to Goans during the 60-day-long ban period, the state directorate of fisheries is rearing milkfish (Chanos  ) at Ela farm,  . The fish, cultivated in December 2017, is scheduled to be harvested by mid-June.

 “The seasonal fisheries ban imposed from June 1 to July 31 often leaves locals with options like dry or frozen fish. With this initiative, we will be able to provide them fresh fish. Later on, we may experiment with other fish varieties too,” said a fisheries official. This is the second year in a row the department is engaging in milkfish cultivation.
 
 The fish seeds were provided by the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture, Tamil Nadu, last year. This year the seeds have come from the Chennai-based Central   (CIBA), a research institute under   ( ).
 
 Once harvested the fish will be sold at the fisheries department headquarters in Panaji. Weighing anywhere between 1.5-2kg per fish, a total of 1.5 tonnes to about two tonnes of fish is expected to be harvested.
 
 “We are trying to procure more seeds and stock the same in small 2,000sqm ponds at the farm in Old Goa for rearing and then transfer them to the bigger 15,000sqm ponds so that they grow together later,” the fisheries official said.
