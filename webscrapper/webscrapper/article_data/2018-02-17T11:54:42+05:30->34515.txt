THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   has simplified the procedure for cancellation of   of vehicles with financial institutions.   K Padmakumar has instructed officials not to wait for a report from financial institution to cancel hypothecation.

 There are over 30,000 applications for cancellation of hypothecation pending at various road transport offices in the state now. The commissioner said in his circular that the main reason for pendency was the non-response from financial institutions to requests from the department for confirmation about clearance of liability.
 
 “People find it difficult to transfer or sell the vehicle if the hypothecation is not cancelled even after the financial liability is cleared. Also, the central motor vehicles rules does not demand a confirmation from the financing authority,” Padmakumar said.
 
 
 
 
 He said the rules wanted the registering authority to cancel the hypothecation of vehicles with financial institutions if it received an application for the same in relevant form (form 35) along with the registration certificate and fee.
 
 At present, the MVD officials seek a confirmation report from the financial institution even after receiving an application in prescribed format. “In most cases, the institutions, except major ones, hardly bother to respond and the applications get stuck at the RTO office without any decision. It should not be the concern of the MVD to protect the interests of the financier if the papers submitted by the vehicle owner are legal and in order,” a senior official said.
 
 The circular wants the RTO to send an information about the cancellation to the financier, and initiate criminal action against the vehicle owner if any objection is received from the financier. The commissioner has also asked all RTOs to clear the pending applications in a month.
