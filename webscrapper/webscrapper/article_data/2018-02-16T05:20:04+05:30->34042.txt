 An intervention application to Dhumak’s plea was submitted by another aggrieved public prosecutor through advocate Sahilesh Kantharia. The application states that he was one of the aggrieved parties in the complaint filed by an officer of the AGP’s office. The lawyer said the accused in connivance with each other got the money meant for him and other government pleaders into their own accounts.
