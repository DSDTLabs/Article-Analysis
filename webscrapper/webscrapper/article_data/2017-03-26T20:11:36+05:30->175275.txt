DEHRADUN:   has decided to accord   status for   and  , the parents of UP CM  , who reside in their native village Panchur in  .

 State police officials said on Sunday that the two will get 24-hour protection from security personnel, including two personal security officers. The decision to provide them security was taken in view of the threat perception to them after their son became CM. “Because the post of the UP CM is an extremely high-profile one and his immediate relatives are also in the public eye, it was decided to bolster their security,” said a senior official involved in the decision. 
 
 A few days after Adityanath was sworn in, Pauri district police had deployed armed security personnel at his parents’ home in view of the large number of people who had started visiting them. Elaborating on the reasons for extending the security,  , senior superintendent of police (SSP), Pauri, told TOI,“After Yogi Adityanath became the CM, their house witnessed an influx of people wanting to meet them. Therefore, in view of the situation and to ensure their safety is not compromised, we decided to provide them security.”
 
 Meanwhile, state director general of police (DGP)   said that the deployment of security personnel as per Y-category status would be done soon at the residence of the UP CM’s parents. “The final order is likely to be issued on Monday and prescribed security cover would be given to them accordingly,” he said. 
 
 Usually, a Y-category security cover encompasses two personal security officers, one head constable and four constables. The number of security personnel can be adjusted after assessing the threat perception of the individuals.
