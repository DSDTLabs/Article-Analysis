NEW DELHI: A battle of wits in the   polls is on the cards with   deciding to field candidates for all three seats falling vacant, setting up a clash with   which has fielded Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 Congress has sufficient votes in the assembly to secure the third seat but the rebellion of senior leader Shankarsinh   was seen to have resulted in the cross voting of 11 party MLAs in the presidential poll. If Vaghela supporters play a similar role in the RS election, the Patelâ€™s seat could be in jeopardy.
