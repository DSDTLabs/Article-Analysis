Kolkata: A group of tourists stranded at Chitkul in Himachal Pradesh came down safely to Sangla on Saturday afternoon. ITBP men dredged an 8km stretch of snow-covered road to get them out of the inaccessible area. 

 The 70-member group from Barasat and adjoining areas reached Chitkul on the evening of April 4 and got stranded for five days as heavy, incessant snowfall cut off the road that went under 3-4feet snow.
 
 “Now we are out of danger. Some, however, have minor health problems,” said Sukanto Sikder, one of the tourists. “The weather was not comfortable at all we we started from Chitkul at 12.30pm on Saturday. The road was motorable after the first 8kms but still risky,” he added.
 
 “In the morning, ITBP men came to our hotel and their medical team conducted a thorough medical check-up, gave medicines to some of us who were feeling a bit unwell,” said Jayanta Sen, another tourist. Tapasi Dey, who was taking care of ailing Pushpo Sikdar, the seniormost tourist in the group, said, “It would have been difficult for us to come out of the area without the ITBP men. Two of their officers stayed in a hotel nearby to help us as their nearest camp was 3kms away from here.”
 
 Even though the tourists have managed to leave the area, some still don’t know how to travel back to Kolkata. “We are approaching Rampur, some 100kms from Sangla. We had our train tickets booked for Saturday but we missed the train. Now, it will be difficult to arrange tickets for such a big group.” said Jhuma Sikdar, another tourist. 
 
 Sudipto Sikdar, a family member of one of the  , said a list of names has already been sent to Sunil Mukherjee, the Barasat municipality chairman, with a request to arrange for railway tickets. “It could be difficult to arrange for tickets over the weekend,” said Sudipto.
