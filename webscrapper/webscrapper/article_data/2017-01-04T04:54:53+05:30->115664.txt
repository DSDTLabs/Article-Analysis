NEW DELHI: Despite the government’s repeated stand that   is optional, the fact that eateries across India include this fee in bills of consumers has exposed why central advisories lack bite. 

 Advisories are not binding on the stakeholders and states hardly pay heed to such stands of the Centre. While   ministry officials admit to their advisories falling in deaf ears, they have no other option but to create awareness. 
 
 “In western countries, customers are asked how much service charge they would like to pay since it’s a tip. But here, the eateries neither ask nor do they mention how this optional charge is linked to the quality of service,” said an official. The official said that though the eateries’ associations agree with the Centre’s stance, none of their members display prominently this provision in their menu. 
 
 Consumer activists said that rather than completing formalities by issuing advisories, the government must come out with practical solutions. “Why can’t they make it mandatory that eateries leave the service charge section blank thereby giving the option to customers to pay or not? At present, consumers have only option of taking such cases to consumer forums, which is a lengthy process,” asked Amit Agrawal, an activist. 
 
 TOI on November 30 had first reported that the consumer affairs ministry had informed the Parliament that paying service charge was optional and levying such an amount without the knowledge of consumers was “unfair trade practice”. An official said they were hopeful of the state labour department swinging to action since in many cases the service charge collected by eateries might not be even passed on to their workers.
