NAVI MUMBAI: Santacruz realtor,  , has complained to Unit 2 of Economic Offences Wing that two property investors sold a   plot in Kalamboli to another builder, despite selling the said plot to him in 2005.

 Acting on a complaint lodged by Shah, an FIR was recently registered at Vashi police station against the three accused, property investors   and   and PAP Kanhaiyalal Lundh.
 
 A crime branch official said that Lundh was allotted a 700 sq m plot by Cidco as 12.5% compensation for land acquisition in sector 22. Mahadik and Patel purchased the plot from Lundh and sold it to Dr   for Rs 1.02 crore. 
 
 The Seths gave them Rs 50 lakh as part payment but cancelled the deal later and demanded refund. 
 
 “Meanwhile, the duo struck a deal with Shah and asked him to pay Rs 50 lakh to the Seths. When he paid the money, the Seths inked a cancellation deed and a new sale deed agreement was signed between the investors and Shah,” he added.
 
 Recently Shah came to know that the duo had sold the same plot to another builder, Ramesh Chauhan.
