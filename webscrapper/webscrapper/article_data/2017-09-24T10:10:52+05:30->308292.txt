MOHALI: The brutal double murder of senior journalist   and his mother Gurcharan Kaur, 92, has sent shockwaves across the Tricity.

 Even though a car, a LED TV and jewellery were stolen from his house in Phase 3B2, police suspect the motive was not robbery. A senior police official said, “The   was just a distraction. The motive is something else. We are investigating the case.”
 
 A wallet and cell phone of K J Singh were also missing. He was not in a habit to keep cash and mostly used debit or credit cards for payments, said family members.
 
 The house of K J Singh is located in a corner of the street. On the right side is a park, while on the left is a house owned by an NRI, which is looked after by his servants.
 
 Rajdeep Singh, a resident living right in front of K J Singh’s house, said, “It was on Thursday when I last saw aunty (Gurcharan Kaur) and uncle (K J Singh). He was not able to reverse his car and I did it for him.”
 
 Rekha, a maid, said, “I come around 9 am daily and K J Singh opens the door. But today no one came out even though I rang the bell a number of times. I then left.”
 
 Gurmeet Singh, another neighbour, said, “K J Singh and his mother used to lock the doors of their house around 7 pm. We did not see anyone entering or exiting the house.”
 
 Kusum, servant of the NRI owner of the house said, “Gurcharan Kaur used to bless me and she always gave something to my kids and on Thursday she gave biscuits to my kids, after that I never saw her.”
