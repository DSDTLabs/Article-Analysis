 "We lost the Cape Town Test but I think this team has the quality to bounce back, provided we get the combination right. Ajinkya Rahane is one of our best batsmen in Test cricket and we have to find a place for him in the squad. Pujara and Rahane are the backbone of our team and they need to be backed consistently. I think this team has all the bases covered to win matches outside the subcontinent," Jaffer wrote in his column for TOI.

 Jaffer also lauded Delhi fast bowler   for his incredible show across the Indian domestic format and feels that he can be a prospect for the team.
 
 "In India, cricket is a religion but not many know about Navdeep Saini (Delhi pacer), who according to me is ready for international cricket," Jaffer said. "He has got the pace and accuracy to trouble top quality batsmen, but despite this, nobody knows about him."
 
 Saini's success over the past two-and-a-half months has been a big factor in Delhi reaching the Ranji final for the first time in a decade, when they last won the coveted title: 29 wickets in seven matches, second on the team's bowling chart behind the left-arm spinner Vikas Mishra's 32.
 
 "Here comes the role of media and more so of radio commentary. People walking on roads or living in the remotest part of our country can tune into commentary easily and they can know about young upcoming talent from Ranji and the international circuit. On the personal front, it was a phenomenal feeling for me to be a part of Vidarbhaâ€™s journey towards their maiden Ranji title," Jaffer said.
