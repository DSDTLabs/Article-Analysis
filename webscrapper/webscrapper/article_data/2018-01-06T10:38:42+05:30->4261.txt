NAGPUR: There seems to be end to the parking woes of Sitabuldi, as Nagpur Improvement Trust’s (NIT’s) multi-level parking plaza is finding no takers. Car owners park their vehicles here and there in   even though the Sitabuldi parking plaza is close by. The plaza is closed since October 2016.

 NIT superintending engineer   said the civic agency had floated a tender to operate the parking but only one firm bid for it. “We have decided to go in for retendering. The tender can’t be processed unless there are three companies bidding,” he added.
 
 A source in NIT said that apathy of traffic police towards vehicles parked in no-parking areas, and existence of ample parking in the adjacent   were main reasons for cold response from bidders. “The plaza was opened for public in September 2013. All the firms which operated the plaza since then have incurred huge losses. The plaza has a capacity for parking of 72 cars. It must get at least 150 cars per day to break even. However, barring weekends, the plaza got hardly 50 cars,” he added.
 
 “The multi-level parking has huge overheads. The operator has to maintain a certain staff strength. In addition, he has to pay huge power bills. In these circumstances, decent traffic has to be there,” the source said.
 
 The NIT official also said that traffic police must ensure that nobody parks in the no-parking zones in Sitabuldi. “Only then will vehicle owners be forced to use the multi-level parking. When people start using the parking, traffic congestion in Sitabuldi will automatically reduce,” he added.
 
 The parking plaza has a capacity of 72 cars at a time is an eight-storey structure. The space meant for parking has 18 levels or parking slots, one above the other. Four cars can be parked at each level.
