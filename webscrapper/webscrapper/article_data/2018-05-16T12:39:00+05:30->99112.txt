COIMBATORE: Two elephants were found dead at different parts of the district on Tuesday. 

 While a six-year-old male elephant was found dead at   near   forest range, the carcass of a female elephant was found near the   dam.
 
 Around 9am, when the anti-poaching watchers were on patrolling duty, they came across the carcass of the elephant near   in   and had immediately alerted the forest officials who in turn brought the veterinary dispensary doctor to perform post-mortem, said an official from the forest department.
 
 “Post-mortem was conducted, and the carcass of the elephant was buried,” the official said, adding that wound in the mouth was found on the male elephant and it could be caused by a wild boar. 
 
 Intestinal worms could be the reason for death of female elephant, the official added. 
 
 The preliminary autopsy for the elephant was conducted and the samples of vital organs were being sent to the veterinary forensic lab in the city for further test. The official said that the cause of the death is yet to be identified.
