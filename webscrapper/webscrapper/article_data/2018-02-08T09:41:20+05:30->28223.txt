NAGPUR:  , former MP and chairman of Congress’s state disciplinary committee, has written a letter to the Congress president   seeking action against former MP   and city president Vikas Thakre. He has charged them with indulging in anti-party activities. A few days ago, Thakre had issued a show-cause notice to former minister Satish Chaturvedi for anti-party activities. Awari has claimed that the notice issued to Chaturvedi was aimed at creating rift in the party.

 Awari alleged that   and Thakre were responsible for the loss the party had to face in the   (NMC) elections in 2007, 2012 and 2017. He charged them with issuing double AB forms to candidates during 2017 NMC elections.
 
 Earlier, BJP was allowed to win MLC elections unopposed as Muttemwar prevailed upon the Congress candidate to withdraw in favour of  , son of a top leader of the erstwhile Jansangh.
 
 After NMC elections, Muttemwar and Thakre had appointed a person of their choice as leader of opposition in the NMC. However, the majority of the corporators were against this person and soon formed a separate group and elected their own leader of opposition. Instead of accepting the will of the majority, Thakre’s nominee approached the high court and lost the case.
 
 Later while co-opting a corporator from Congress quota, Thakre proposed his own name. However, majority of the party corporators proposed another name. When Thakre failed in his attempt to get co-opted, he too approached the HC.
 
 Awari claimed that Muttemwar and Thakre managed to enrol only 23,000 members for organizational elections against 65,000 enrolled by other leaders. This shows that they and their supporters are in a minority.
