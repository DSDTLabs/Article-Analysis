CHENNAI: Police on Sunday arrested a 30-year-old burglar who, on a two-month spree, targeted at least 10 houses in Virugambakkam while the occupants were away.

 They seized 25 sovereigns (200g) of gold jewellery around Rs 53 lakh from him.
 
 Footage from   helped police identify him.
 
 Police had received   of   from households in the locality in the recent past. When they checked security cameras from some of the apartments, they found a man breaking open houses whose residents were away.
 
 Investigators nabbed   while he was riding his motorcycle during a vehicle check at Virugambakkam. He resembled the burglar, so a team headed by a sub-inspector of police confronted him. “He was carrying tools like screwdrivers and hacksaws in a bag on his bike,“ an investigating officer said.
 
 They found that he targeted houses when the occupants were away. Pandian would monitor a house for two consecutive days before breaking in on the third day .He went cruising on his motorcycle, looking for locked houses and planning escape routes.
 
 “He mostly targeted individual houses as it is more difficult to break into apartments. He always entered through the back door of flats,“ the officer said.
 
 Pandian told police he burgled houses to make some quick money. A dropout, Pandian wanted to live a luxurious life. “He spent his plunder on booze and women,“ the officer said.
 
 Pandian operated alone. Police are, however, checking if other people helped him commit his crimes. He disposed gold jewellery through a pawnbroker in Trichy , police said. A court has remanded Pandian in judicial custody.
