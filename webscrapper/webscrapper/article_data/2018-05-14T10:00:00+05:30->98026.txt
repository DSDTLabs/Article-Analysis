‘Do you have one extra ticket for  ?’ an old lady asked   as she was entering Nandan for the premiere of Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee’s much-awaited film. Many braved the rains to catch a glimpse of the actors and try their luck at the ticket counter. 

  
 Even though the cast was met with thunderous applause, little Brata Banerjee, aka Bhutu, was the star of the evening. Not only did he make a last-minute entry, he was heard screaming, “Shob maan samman chole gelo”. He later said that he would put a sticker on his cheeks with the words, ‘No haami please’, written in bold. Despite that, no one could save him from the kisses that were thrown at him by the hundreds. ‘I wanted 21 tickets for the premeire but 
 shibuda said no. Then I threatened to give the premiere a miss. but nothing worked!,’ said little Brata Banerjee. 
 
 
 
  
 Paoli, looking resplendent in an off-white anarkali, attended the premiere with hubby Arjun Deb. “Shibuda rightly said — boroder jonne chhotoder chhobi and I am amazed to watch the three kids! They have truly won my heart. The film is hilarious and I liked the way a serious issue is dealt with in an easy manner,” said Paoli with a smile.

 The leading ladies of Tollywood turned heads in the whole six yards. “After watching the film, I am confused about whose performance I liked the most,” said  , who wore a printed chiffon sari with minimal makeup. 
 
  
 Gargee RoyChowdhury, who is known for her huge range of saris, came in a bit late for the premeire as she had her rehearsals. Said the actress, “Mitali, my character in the film, is liked by all.   makes for a wonderful couple — they are your everyday characters who don’t find place in mainstream movies.”
