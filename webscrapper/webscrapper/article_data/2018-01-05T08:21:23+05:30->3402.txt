AHMEDABAD: A   on Thursday denied bail to suspended IAS officer   again in connection with a money laundering case.

 Enforcement Directorate had slapped charges of money laundering against Sharma in 2012 on basis of an FIR filed by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) accusing him of corruption. He was arrested in July 2016. As a district collector of Kutch in 2004, Sharma was accused of allotting land to Welspun Group at 25% of market rate and thereby causing loss of Rs 1.2 crore to the government exchequer.
 
 According to ED’s counsel Sudhir Gupta, this was the first instance of denial of bail to an undertrial in Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after the Supreme Court struck down a provision which used to prohibit courts from granting bail in money laundering cases. Earlier, Sharma had been denied bail on the ground that he could not convince the court that he was not guilty. 
 
 The ED probe has revealed that Sharma’s wife invested just Rs 1 lakh to become 30% partner in a company and then in return she continued to receive crores of rupees in her and her children’s accounts in USA through havala entries via Dubai.
