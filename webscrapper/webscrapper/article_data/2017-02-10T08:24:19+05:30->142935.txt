PUDUCHERRY: AIADMK general secretary   expelled former AIADMK MLA Om Sakthi Sekar from primary membership for indulging in antiparty activities. Sekar openly came out in support of chief minister   who revolted against Sasikala. 

 Sekar burst crackers and distributed sweets to passersby after Panneerselvam in an emotional outburst charged that he was forced to tender resignation by Sasikala.
 
 Sekar appreciated Panneerselvam for revealing the 'truth' and said that the revelation would rest late chief minister J Jayalalithaa's soul in peace. Stating that he was not worried about his expulsion, he said his supporters have decided to extend unconditional support to Panneerselvam.
 
 Sekar, who won twice from   constituency (2006 and 2011), lost the polls to Congress candidate A John Kumar in May 2016 assembly polls. 
 
 He again lost 2016 November by-poll to chief minister V Narayanasamy. Sekar shot to fame in 2006 assembly polls by defeating former chief minister and DMK leader  , who was elected from the constituency for five consecutive terms (1985-2001).
