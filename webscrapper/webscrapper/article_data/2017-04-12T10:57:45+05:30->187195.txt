NAGPUR: In a move that would boost bamboo production in Maharashtra, the state government has freed transit pass (TP) condition for bamboo grown on private land.

 A notification in this regard was issued on Tuesday. Till now, bamboo was not grown by farmers as a mandatory TP was demanded by the forest department under Indian Forest Act 1927.
 
 According to  , chairman of   (BSI), Maharashtra Chapter, the decision will boost bamboo production and industry based on bamboo products will grow.
 
 Mostly, land in   is suitable for both bamboo species — Dendrocalamus strictus and   bamboos. The state has made it clear that part from both these species, other bamboo species grown on private land will also not need a TP.
 
 Till now only the above two species of bamboo were grown in the region. Now, as no bamboo species will need a TP, other species will also have scope. “This will go a long way in improving agriculture crisis in the region. Many substitute industries will also grow,” says Joshi.
 
 Earlier, on June 24, 2013, the state government had removed the TP condition for bamboo species on private land in Western Maharashtra.
