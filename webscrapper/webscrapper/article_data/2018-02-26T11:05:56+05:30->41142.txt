Business appears to be normal in silk sari shops at Chinthamaniyur, Semmandapatty and   villages in   district. But the weavers are a worried lot as the fluctuation in pure silk thread price is affecting the industry. They said the shop owners reduce orders when the silk threads price increase as they get fewer customers when they price the saris higher.

 "  holds the monopoly in ‘pure’ silk thread business and they fix the price for the entire country," said K Subramaniam, a weaver. He said they were finding it difficult to sustain the business due to the fluctuating prices.
 
 Six months ago, 1kg of pure silk thread was available in the market for Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000, depending on its quality. "Now it is between Rs 5,000 and Rs 5,500," he said. It will go up further after adding 5% GST.
 
 Similarly, one kilo of ‘jari’ (used on sari border) was available for Rs 700 four months ago; now it has crossed Rs 800. "Along with the base price, we have to pay 18% GST," M Saravanan, another weaver, said.
 
 The weavers said textile shop owners, both wholesalers and retailers, reduced the orders when thread prices increased. "We could get good orders if the rates are stable or low," the weavers said. They are appealing to the central government to look into their grievance and save the industry.
 
 The weavers also appeal to the central and state governments to get a special ‘logo’ for Salem pure silk saris. "If we get a separate logo, our sales volume will go up," said C P Saravanan, owner, K Perumal Silks, Chinthamaniyur.
 
 The weavers and shop owners want the state government to start an exclusive park in Salem for ‘silk saris’ to promote Salem silk across the globe.
