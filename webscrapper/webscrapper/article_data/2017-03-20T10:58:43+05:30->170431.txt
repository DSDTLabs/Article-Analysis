VISAKHAPATNAM: Not many have the guts to quit a well-paying job to pursue their passion. But  , a corporate   from Chennai, dared. This biker and sailing enthusiast left his job to tour across India, capturing the story of his journey through videos and learning new things on the way.

 The Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500 biker is currently in   on his way to eastern India. He was spotted at Rushikonda where he intends to stop over and pick up surfing lessons. He plans to learn it before proceeding towards Odisha, Bengal and the North East.
 
 “My solo across-the-country travel commenced last year. Having completed Ladakh and the north, the Himalayan region, and then Rajasthan and Gujarat in the west as well as after finishing all the southern states, I’m now in Andhra Pradesh exploring the rural beauty of the region and plan to tour the country by September this year,” said Rohith.
 
 “After working for five years in Chennai, I realised that life was getting dangerously close to routine. There was not much time for anything else except work. Work will always be there and in a few years, family responsibilities will come in the way. So now is the time to live the life that I want to, explore and learn new things, travel extensively. I had saved some money while working in the law firm and with this saving, I ventured onto the road trip on my bullet,” he added.
 
 Rohith also takes videos, still shots and recounts the story of his journeys on his website tollfreetraveller.com.
 
 “Each place has its own charm, be it Kashmir or Coringa sanctuary. That’s why, I don’t have any target. Sometimes, I have travelled 700 kilometres in one day to Hyderabad or through three states in one-day. I have stayed in places like rural AP’s Antarvedi and experience the hospitality of the local people,” averred Rohith, who usually camps in his own tent during his travels.
