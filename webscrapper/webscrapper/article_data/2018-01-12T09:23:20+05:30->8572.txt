MARGAO:   responded to sharp-shooting responsibility with aplomb, twice pulling the trigger to shoot   to a 2-1 win over   in an   match at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, here on Thursday.

 On a night when compatriot and talisman Ferran Corominas fired blanks, the Spanish attacking midfielder sent 17,000 home fans into delirium with a penalty conversion on the dot of halftime and a touch of panache while scoring the match-winner on the hour after midfielder Brandon Fernandes split a doughty Jamshedpur defence apart.
 
 Lanzarote's strike revitalised the hosts after shoulders drooped and self-doubts surfaced after Trinidade Goncalves, the Brazilian, produced the equaliser out of nothing in the 54th minute amid a transfixed FC Goa defence, largely castigated for frailities in the back-line this season.
 
 But it was all's well that ends well for FC Goa, even to the tune of Laxmikant Kattimani, their beleaguered goalkeeper at the centre of criticism for defensive frailties, picking up the man of the match award.
 
 The hard-earned victory now lifts FC Goa to fourth spot from fifth in the 10-team league while Jamshedpur stay at seventh.
