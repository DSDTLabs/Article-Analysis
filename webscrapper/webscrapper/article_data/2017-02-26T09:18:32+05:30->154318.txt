Out of every 10 luxury vehicles involved in campaigning in remote Utraula assembly segment of this district, at least three have scaled a distance of 1,500 km from   to participate in UP elections. People from almost every house here are either in Mumbai or Dubai.

 Two days before polling in   district, the migrants have come back to make their presence felt. In fact two contestants in the fray—BSP’s Parvez Umar and AIMIM’s Nizamullah Khan—are well-wheeled businessmen settled in Mumbai, who are back to their roots to earn the political capital.
 
 Hakim Shaikh, a builder from Kurla is one such. He asked his men to drive down Toyota Fortuner to Utraula before taking a flight. “About 150 luxury vehicles have come to participate in campaign from Mumbai. We will cast vote and head back later on. UP elections are always crucial for migrants as it is difficult for them to cut off from their native villages,” says Hakim, who is dressed smartly to spread the work for Parvez Umar.
 
 Utraula is a nagar palika of about 35,000 people, of which 60% are Muslim. “Though we are staying far away from Utraula and  , you can never take out UP from a UPite,” shares Alauddin Khan, a furniture businessman from Jogeshwari in Mumbai who is planning to stay put in Utraula up to February 28. Both Nizamullah and Parvez are settled in Kurla and have multiple business interests.
