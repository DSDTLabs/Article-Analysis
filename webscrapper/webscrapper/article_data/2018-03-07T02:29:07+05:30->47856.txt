NOIDA: The Noida metro expects a daily footfall of around 65,000 when it launches its first trains on the Aqua Line later this year, but five of 21 stations that make up the route are unlikely to make any contribution to this.

 The 30km Metro line from Noida to Greater Noida is approaching its scheduled commissioning date of April 2018 but a question mark hangs over the feasibility of five consecutive stations that have no habitation around them.
 
 Eleven sectors — 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 148A, 149, 152, 153, 154 and 167 — located along the   and metro corridor are yet to be developed. Of these,   have been built in five sectors — 144, 146, 147, 149 and 153. Eventually, these stations could become magnets for residential development of these sectors but, in short term, they will struggle for passengers. 
 
 “Infrastructure planning is always done keeping in mind future population and prospective habitation in 1-1.5km catchment area along any metro corridor,” said  , managing director of Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) when asked if the feasibility of the stations was a concern. “The location of stations is chosen based on development and population around them as well as the availability of right kind of infrastructure to support the metro,” Tandon added.
 
 The land in the sectors near these five metro stations has been categorised for projects such as group housing, institutional, industrial and commercial but those are yet to be allotted or sold. Sectors 146 and 147 largely comprise group housing plots while sectors 155, 156, 157 and 159 are industrial.
 
 “Initially, we’ll have to ferry commuters to the stations. We’ll run NMRC feeder buses to help commuters in the vicinity reach stations,” Tandon said, adding the success of Noida metro corridor would eventually depend on its connectivity with other metro networks. The Aqua Line will share an interface with Delhi Metro’s Blue Line that is being extended from Noida City Centre to NH-24 (at Sector 62). “In coming years, we are likely to see a multiplier effect kicking-in with a proposed multi-level transport system and other connectivity corridors that have been planned for the city,” Tandon said.
 
 The NMRC chairman, who also head Noida Authority, said two proposed Metro corridors — from Sector 143 to Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Sector 71 to Greater Noida (west) — kept on hold for lack of funds would be revived. “We plan to take up these projects in the near future under  , an umbrella metro rail authority cleared by the state cabinet,” Tandon said.
 
 The corporation is a joint venture between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government and was proposed by chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath to expedite work on metro projects. In this year’s state budget, the Yogi government has earmarked Rs 500 crore for various metro projects in the state.
