CHARMINAR: With the holy month of Ramzan round the corner,   is abuzz with hectic preparations to dish out the traditional Hyderabad Haleem. By default, traders selling the essential 'Haleem-making spoon' are in great demand right now. 

 The spoons made of wood, popularly known as 'ghotas', play a key role in the making of the dish.
 
 One only needs to head to the oldest ghota-making shop in the bustling   area near Charminar to see the frenetic pace of activity. The owner of the shop   (46) has been making and supplying these wooden spoons along with his family for the past 30 years.
 
 "We started making ghotas about 10 days ago and are already receiving bulk orders from restaurants across the city," Anwar said. Anwar receives orders from  , Cafe Bahar and   every year. "On an average, we receive an order of 150 ghotas for Pista House, 50 ghotas for Paradise and another 50 for Cafe Bahar each year. Though there are other ghota-selling shops in places like Begum Bazaar, most hotels in the city prefer buying from us," he said.
 
 Anwar, who works as a chef the rest of the year, makes about 1,000 ghotas during Ramzan. While the price of each ghota, traders say, varies according to size, it usually costs between 400 and 600 each. 
 
 Another ghota seller says, "Restaurant owners will start buying after 'jagne ki raat' that is observed about 10 or 15 days before Ramzan". "We sell at least 20 ghotas per day just before the season starts," he said.
 
 "Orders we receive for ghotas are only increasing each year. People from Dubai and the US have also bought ghotas from us," Anwar said.
