Ghaziabad: After missing out on two deadlines, the 10.3-km UP Gate-Rajnagar Extension   is finally on track. The  , after repeated discussions with the railways, has sought its permission for constructing a portion of elevated road that is to pass over the Vasundhara rail line.

  Sources said the railways will give GDA a five-hour window for about a month starting September 27 to carry out construction work on this section. The elevated road is 85% complete.
 
 “The commissioner of   safety has given a go-ahead to construct a portion of the elevated road that is to pass over the rail line in Vasundhara. We will be given a five-hour window from 27 September for about a month to wrap the work on the section,” said Kanchan Verma, vice chairperson, GDA, adding, “With civil work on either side of the rail line almost complete we intend to wrap up the work by November 30 this year as we have already missed two earlier deadline.”
 
 Earlier, the GDA had paid the railways Rs 8.26 crore for drawing and design approval of the elevated road on this section. Work on the elevated road commenced in November 2014 and the completion date was set for April 29, this year. However, the issues with multiple agencies which had stake in the project such the irrigation, forest, railways and irrigation departments held up the work. 
 
 Last year, the NGT had briefly stayed work on a portion of elevated road stating that few pillars of the road were passing through the ‘Arthala bird sanctuary’ in violation of environmental laws.
 
 Being constructed at a cost of Rs 1,248 crore, the six-lane elevated road is touted as the longest elevated road to be built on a single pier. It is being built on 282 piers all through 10.3 km of elevated structure from UP Gate to Rajnagar extension. Once complete, the road will reduce travel time to a mere 10 minutes as opposed to the 45 minutes it takes for commuters to brave massive traffic jams currently.
