NAGPUR: Ignoring the order of Nagpur bench of  , Maharashtra Rashtrabhasha Sabha (MRS) has not paid the first instalment of its revised ground rent and additional premium to   (NIT). The Sabha was supposed to pay the first instalment of about Rs40 crore in April.

 NIT chairman   has issued a show-cause notice to the body for its failure to pay up. MRS vice-president Girish Gandhi refused to comment on the issue when TOI contacted him.
 
 In February, the high court had directed MRS and   to pay Rs163.75 crore as additional premium and ground rent to NIT. The order was issued during the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Citizens’ Forum for Equality. Supreme Court had then refused to stay the recovery process.
 
 Forum president   told TOI that MRS had committed contempt of court by not paying the first instalment. “I will ask NIT to seal Wockhardt Hospital and other institutions housed in the building. If NIT fails to do so, I will again approach the HC,” he said.
 
 NIT had given a plot measuring over 4,100 square metres on   to MRS in 1961 on a 30-year lease. Wockhardt Hospital is located on this land. The lease was then renewed in 1991. In 2000, it sanctioned a building plan for public utility purpose with a provision of 15% commercial use of land. In 2004, the state government changed the user from public utility to commercial. NIT then increased the premium for MRS in 2005 to Rs30 lakh per annum.
 
 Kukde filed the PIL claiming that the premium fixed by NIT was too less and also levelled several other allegations. The high court agreed with its contention and directed NIT to revise the premium and ground rent for MRS.
 
 NIT then recalculated the premium for the period 2005 to 2017 and the amount came to be Rs137.57 crore. The court also felt that the ground rent had not been properly revised from 1991. NIT therefore calculated the same for the period 1991 to 2017, which came to Rs26.17 crore. MRS was thus asked to pay a total of Rs163.75 crore.
