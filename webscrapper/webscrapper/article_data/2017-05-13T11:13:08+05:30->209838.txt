 The Mirwaiz, who is the custodian of the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, demands the implementation of UN resolutions of 1947 regarding Kashmir every Friday. 
 
 Geelani, on the other hand, roots for Kashmir’s accession to Pakistan. Addressing them, Zakir said, “You are our big problem... if you have to run this dirty politics, run it in your homes… if we have to implement the shariat, we have to implement it on ourselves.”
 
 Zakir, a native of terrorist-infested Tral in   district, was studying to be an engineer in a Chandigarh college before picking up arms in July 2016.
 
 “I am not an ulema (sic), but scholars here are corrupt… fearful of crossing limits that they may be imprisoned. That is why we have to come forward,” Zakir said, quoting a verse from the Quran. “They are actually political leaders and they can’t be our leaders,” Zakir said. “Our fight is purely for the sake of Islam, and we shall implement the shariat in Kashmir, insha-Allah,” hesaid.
