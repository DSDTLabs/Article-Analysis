ROHTAK: Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Saturday slammed CM Manohar Lal   over his remarks on land acquisition and the Indian Institute of Management (IIM),  , goof up in Kurukshetra. 

 While replying to a student’s query at   on Friday, CM Khattar had said that he was unaware of IIM Rohtak.
 
 Hooda responded to Khattar’s remark while addressing a press conference at his residence here on Saturday. “Land acquisition is important to set up educational institutions and industries. Is the incumbent   government acquiring a portion of sky that they don’t need land?”
 
 The former CM also attacked Khattar for his remark about not being aware of an IIM in Haryana. “Such a response from a sitting CM, that he had placed a request to open an IIM in the state, is shocking. The fact of the matter is that IIM Rohtak has been running since 2010,” said Hooda, who is an MLA from Garhi-Sampla-Kiloi.
 
 Hooda said 35% construction of IIM Rohtak in its new campus was already done.
 
 About the   commission report, the former CM said the news report clearly stated that it was shared by sources in the government. “Now, who has leaked the report submitted to the chief minister by Justice S N Dhingra to media is an issue and the government should answer this.” 
 
 Hooda added that if Khattar only dreamed about sending him to jail, then he was ready to go there with his briefcase as and when asked to do so.
