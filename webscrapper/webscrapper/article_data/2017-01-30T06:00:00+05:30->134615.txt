 Keshav and Veena looked like a million bucks clad in in red and gold for the main ceremony. Keshav never left Veena’s side throughout the festivities — not even at the pelli kuturu ceremony where the groom isn’t expected to be present. And at the sangeet, the guests couldn’t stop gushing about the moment when they danced to Pehli Nazar Mein, in their colour coordinated outfits. 
 
 
 Carefully designed to suit the mood of each of the ceremonies, the decor got the guests talking. While the mehendi ceremony played out in a carnival-like atmosphere, the sangeet had a heavenly theme filled with lights arranged to look like angels. The temple-themed decor for the muhurtam, was stunning, and was most talked about!
 
 
 
 Ranveer Singh was the star of the night. With his glittery jacket and infectious energy, he set the stage on fire with his performances. He also indulged the guests a little with his banter, we hear.
