Prolonged sleep disturbances due to jet lag or shift work may increase the risk of  , a new study by University of Colorado has found.

 For three weeks, the subjects went to sleep four hours later than the prior day, resulting in a 28-hour “day“. The men were allowed to sleep only 5.6 hours per 24-hour period, since short sleep is also common for night shift workers. While awake, the men ate the same amount of calories and nutrients. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and again after the three weeks of sleep manipulation. Six of the men were aged between 20 to 27 and the other four were aged between 55 to 65.
 
 Researchers found after three weeks all men had reduced levels of bone formation marker P1NP compared with baseline. This decline was greater for younger men than older men: a 27% versus 18% decrease. “This altered bone balance creates a bone loss window that could lead to osteoporosis and bone fractures," said Christine Swanson.
