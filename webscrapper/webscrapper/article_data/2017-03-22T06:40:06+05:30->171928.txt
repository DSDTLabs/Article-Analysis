AHMEDABAD: With thousands of people thronging bank branches to deposit invalidated banknotes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 after the announcement of demonetisation on November 8, banks across India saw deposits rise steeply during the quarter ending December 31. Total deposits with banks in Gujarat jumped by Rs 63,778.30 crore in October-December 2016.

  According to data released by the   ( ), Gujarat on Tuesday, deposits in the state surged by Rs 63,778.30 or 11.23% to Rs 6,31,478.3 crore in the October-December quarter from Rs 5,67,700 crore in the July-September period. 
 
 “After the demonetization announcement, specified bank notes (SBN) in circulation were deposited in banks which caused a steep rise of deposits for the quarter ended December 2016. As there were restrictions on withdrawals, deposited SBNs were not fully withdrawn in form of valid currency which caused deposited money to stay longer in bank accounts. Consequently, the total deposits with banks for the quarter appear to have risen sharply,” explained Vikramaditya Singh Khichi, convener, SLBC Gujarat.
 
 Compared to the same period in the previous fiscal, deposits rose by a whopping Rs 1,12,523 crore or 21.68% from the Rs. 5,18,955 crore registered in October-December 2015. The deadline for depositing old notes with the banks was December 30, 2016, except for those who could not deposit the invalid notes because they were abroad.
 
 In a reversal of trends,   deposits have gone down by Rs 1,072 crore. NRI deposits were Rs 65,904 crore, a decrease of 1.6 % from the preceding quarter, when it was Rs 66,976 crore.
 
 Against deposits, advances declined marginally by 0.87% to Rs. 4,44,862 crore in Q3 from Rs. 4,48,774 crore in Q2 of the current fiscal. Advances showed a growth of 7.57% over the same period in 2015-16.
 
 Further, according to the report, some 1.03 crore accounts were opened under   (PMJDY). Of these, 54.13 lakh accounts were in rural areas while 49.31 lakh accounts were in urban areas of the state. The SLBC report also suggests that some 62.55 lakh accounts were Aadhaar-seeded and 84.14 lakh RuPay cards were issued.
