MUMBAI:   probing the sale of a newborn at Wadala found that the father sold his son for Rs 20,000 to repay a Rs 1 lakh loan. 

 Julia Fernandes (29) was arrested last week in connection with the child trafficking racket. "Our teams had gone to Bengaluru and New Delhi in search of child traffickers and buyers," said a senior police officer. Investigators have recovered photographs of some children, however, their identity and whether or not these children were sold is yet to be established. The newborn’s parents—Munna Shaikh (38) and Shazia (35)—were interrogated thoroughly. 
 
 "Shaikh told us that he was under pressure from his creditors who had loaned him around Rs 1 lakh. Shaikh told police he wanted to repay the loan with the money he got by selling his son," said an officer. A search of a house in Wadala yielded the hospital admission and discharge papers of Shazia. Fernandes reportedly admitted to have bought the newborn for Rs 20,000. She told the police that she planned to sell the baby to a childless couple for Rs 1.5 lakh. "Whenever we tried asking her questions about the case, she would say that she has pain in her leg which was operated upon after an accident. We could not get more information," said an officer. After completing her bachelor’s degree in business administration, Fernandes studied nursing. "The court has named the boy Adhiraj. He has been kept at a child welfare centre," added the officer.
