Nagpur: The stage is set for the release of the Brahmapuri problem tigress in Bor Tiger Reserve in Wardha district on Saturday morning. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientist Bilal Habib and forest officials from Pench Tiger Reserve will remain present. The tigress will be released in the area where Navargaon village used to be located. The people here have been completely relocated earlier this year. In doing so, an additional inviolate 17 sqkm area has been added to the core. According to sources, prior to its release in the morning, the tigress will be fitted a satellite radio collar at the Gorewada Rescue Centre where it has been kept after its capture from Brahmapuri on July 10. Officials said on Friday that Habib and divisional forest officers (DFOs) Uttam Sawant and SB Bhalavi went to the rescue centre to examine the tigress and found it to be healthy and aggressive. They later visited Bor to evaluate the area where the tigress is slated to be released, and found it to be good. They also sighted sambars and chitals. The tigress is likely to be released during the day to ensure better monitoring. In the last five years, four captured tigresses were re-released in the wild but all operations were carried during the night.  During the day, there were rumours that the release of the tigress has been put on hold as Gorewada officials did not get any message for the preparations. Finally, around 10pm, Gorewada divisional manager Nandkishore Kale is said to have received the message to get ready for the release of the tigress on Saturday morning.
