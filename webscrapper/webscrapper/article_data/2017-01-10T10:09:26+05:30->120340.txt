 The concert took off with the soulful ‘Jagadoddharana Adisidaleshodaa' composed by Purandaradasa in Kapi raga sung in an open voice by Krishna. The composition was a favorite of M S Subbulakshmi, the Queen of Music.
 
 The beautiful alapana of ‘ragamalika' a colobaration of ‘Bilahari, Biravi, Sama and Vasantha was followed by the ever popular composition ‘Suttum Vizhi sudare....' by Subramania Bharathiar. ‘Barao Krishnaiaya...' in Ragamalika composed by Kanakadasa received a big round of applause.
 
 Krishna, who was performing for the first time in Ooty, also sang a Bengali number as part of the concert. The concert concluded with one of the ‘nottuswarams' by Muthuswamy Dikshitar, ‘MuchchukundhaVaradha Thiagaraja' praising Lord Shiva.
 
 The concert has historical significance as for the first time, the organizers broke with convention and held the event in a star hotel. Throughout the concert, there was pin-drop silence, as the audience was simply mesmerised by the music. 
 
 It is impossible for one to listen to Carnatic music without a sense that there is something much deeper than the ‘raga' itself. Members of ‘Hara-Kol', an initiative which had organized the programme, said the concert was a revelation in many ways. The aim was to expose the audience to Carnatic music with its varied distinctions. Only three Carnatic concerts have been held in the hill town over the past three years.
