Nagpur: The battle for teachers’ constituency elections from Nagpur is heating up with Lok Bharati Party (political affiliate of the teachers’ association Shikshak Bharati) shrilling the pitch. Founded by Mumbai’s MLC Kapil Patil a decade ago, Lok Bharati Party is counting on the increased friction between teachers and the state government to wean away votes. Apart from the mainstream political parties like Congress and BJP, Lok Bharati has emerged a strong contender for the MLC seat. Lok Bharati Party nominee Rajendra Zade filed his nomination on Monday afternoon. He was accompanied by party chief Patil, who is currently the only teacher constituency MLC from the party. “Our parent association Shikshak Bharati has a strong network and reach among teachers and I am confident of victory,” said Zade, who comes from a family of educationists and is counting on his ‘local roots’ to give him an edge over the well oiled BJP machinery and its incumbent candidate Nago Ganar. Rather than targeting Ganar, the party has pitched its war cry a couple of decibels higher at education minister Vinod Tawde. Patil said, “This election is ‘Tawde Vs Zade’. Tawde has failed us (teachers) on every count. Under him we have been insulted and neglected, and now it is time for a payback. Our voting teachers are fully aware that if they don’t vote for Zade then they are inadvertently voting for Tawde, their tormentor,” said Patil. Zade pointed out the recent ‘selfie app’ fiasco as an example of how teachers are being ‘harassed’. He said, “Teachers are being burdened with non-academic work and none of their pleas are being heard. Those in power have not listened to us and it’s time for a change.” Claiming that Shikshak Bharati’s network is gaining popularity, Patil said, “The fact that CM Devendra Fadnavis himself had to come and campaign for Ganar is proof enough that they are scared.”
