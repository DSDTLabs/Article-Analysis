It is a fun number with catchy lyrics, crooned by Antony Dasan, Prathi Balasubramanian, Sharmila. The song has simple beats and the composer has mainly focused on the vocals. The female rap chorus portion is fused well with the rest of the album. Next is  , that has suggestive sounds and lyrics throughout. The double-meaning lyrics, hopefully, will go well with the visuals of the song. This fast-paced track sounds a lot like a jazz number and is sung by Kavitha Thomas, who is well known for her western influences. A quick number, the drums and saxophone is quite overpowering and a few portions have also been sung by Josh Vivian. Bigilu Bigilu is a gana song sung by Marana Gana Viji, who has infused all the energy for the track. This one starts on a slow note, has the usual local beats, but picks up pace. There is also a ‘sangu’ portion in the song, along with a saavu dance bit. This one is a complete dance number with familiar percussion and beats. Whistles, guitars and enjoyable percussion, that is what Chiku Buku is all about. The song, which has a simple tune and pleasant beats, could have most certainly had better lyrics. All the songs seems to have north Chennai Tamil inspiration. Gaana Kadal, who has sung this number, does justice and makes it a fun experience. This one, despite the lyrics, stands out. Finally, there is Haiyo Konjum, composed by Vishal Chandrashekhar. Another romantic number, this one has a laid-back feel to it. The guitar and thavil portions stand out.   and Sindhuri   croon this number. The lyrics, again, are a drawback. Sindhuri’s voice modulation and pronunciation is amusing and interesting.
