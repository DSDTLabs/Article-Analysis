NEW DELHI: The 14 grounded Pratt and Whitney (PW)- powered   A-320 new engine option (Neo) aircraft of IndiGo and GoAir have finally resumed flying. The grounding of these planes, 11 of IndiGo and three of GoAir, started in February following an order from European aviation agency and then another directive from the   last month due to constant snags in the variant of PW engines powering these planes.

 According to sources, DGCA chief B S Bhullar had given a stern warning to Pratt to quickly replace the snag-prone engines. The warning worked and now the planes are back in the air before the start of the coming peak summer travel season. What’s more Airbus will now resume deliveries of PW-powered planes to IndiGo and GoAir.
 
 IndiGo officials confirmed that all their grounded   are flying again. While Pratt engines of Neo — a combination ordered by IndiGo and GoAir — have been suffering from snags for almost two years, things worsened for them this February when   ( ) issuing an emergency airworthiness directive after a few occurrences of aborted take-off and in-flight shut down. After this three IndiGo Neos which had both affected engines were grounded.
 
 Even after this, India saw three engine failures in a month. Then the DGCA ordered that Neos with even one affected engine be grounded till Pratt replaces the engines, a process that has now been completed.
 
 With 430 A-320 Neo family planes on order, IndiGo is Airbus’s biggest customer globally for this aircraft. GoAir has ordered 72 A-320 Neos with PW engines and is yet to decide the engine for an additional order of 72 Neos it confirmed last year. Air India and   also use A-320 but those are powered by CFM engines which are not facing the same issues as PW engines.
