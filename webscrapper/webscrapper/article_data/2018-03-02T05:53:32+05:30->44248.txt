NEW DELHI: Faced with continued attack with water balloons while walking on the streets, students and teachers of  's Jesus and   on Thursday led a protest march to the   headquarters.

  A group of students and teachers met the joint commissioner of police and submitted a memorandum seeking their safety and security during the festive period. The students also demanded strict action against miscreants who attacked women during Holi. 
 
 The protestors also asked for police patrolling on streets, to ensure that people don't sell colours on public roads illegally. "We asked the joint commissioner to ensure that bus drivers and conductors are instructed to report any form of hooliganism on public transport," said a student from Jesus and Mary College.
 
 Teachers, accompanying the students, asked police officers to also appoint marshals inside buses, who would maintain law and order during the festive period.
 
 "We will take all required steps to prevent hooliganism during Holi and will ensure proper safety and security of the students," deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said.
 
  Protesting outside the police headquarters, the students shared incidents of rude behaviour they faced in the past during Holi. "Earlier, people used to throw dirt-filled balloons, but now they are attacking women and others with semen-filled balloons. We cannot step outside our hostels as people block the roads and make obscene gestures at us," said another student. 
 
 "Such ill-practices during festivals must stop now. How far can students go without missing classes during festive period?" a teacher of Jesus and Mary College said.
