MUMBAI: State transport commissioner Praveen Gedam on Tuesday launched a special drive to eliminate the presence of unscrupulous   and   from city RTOs. Apparently, this is also a warning for officials at these RTOs, many of whom are hand-in-glove with the agents, sources said.

 Acting on complaints that touts had a ‘flourishing’ business at Tardeo RTO, Gedam sent a vigilance squad and laid a trap for a tout on Tuesday morning. Said Gedam, “I got complaints from several citizens that it was difficult getting work done at Tardeo   without going through an agent. So, a squad was sent to lay a trap and they nabbed a tout, Krushna Salve (22), who was asking for excess money to issue a duplicate licence,” he said.
 
 Salve was found demanding Rs 800 for a duplicate licence, while the normal charges are not more than Rs 264 for the same. “We have registered a complaint against him at Tardeo police station,” he stated. 
 
 Gedam added: “We will continue our crackdown against unscrupulous touts by sending citizens as decoy to other RTOs as well.”
