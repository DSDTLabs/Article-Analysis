MUMBAI: The   on Monday announced 24 candidates in its first list for the forthcoming BMC polls. The list includes two sitting corporators-Ishaq Shaikh and Raees Kasam Shaikh-and seven non-Muslims. 

 SP state president and MLA Abu   said his party would better its tally of victories (9) from 2012. "Our cadre has become stronger over the years and we hope to improve our performance from the last civic elections," he said.
 
 The party is banking on Muslim and north Indian votes but will face a tough competition from the MIM which is fighting the BMC polls for the first time after winning two seats in the 2014 assembly elections. "The MIM doesn't have much to offer except hollow slogans and emotional issues raised by MIM leaders, especially the Owaisi brothers (  and  ). Our list of candidates have north Indians, Maharashtrians, Memons, Gujaratis, Christians and Muslims. This shows we are truly secular," said  , SP's group leader who is contesting from ward 211 (Madanpura). 
 
 "We are the preferred choice of Muslims. SP will be decimated this time," said MIM legislator Waris Pathan. A source said SP will wait for the MIM to announce its list before declaring more names.
