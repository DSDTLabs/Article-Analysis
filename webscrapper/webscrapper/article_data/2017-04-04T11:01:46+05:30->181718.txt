MUMBAI: Former India team director   feels topranked Indian cricketers are being “paid peanuts“ as compared to their English and Australian counterparts and the Board should equally remunerate those Test players who weren't able to bag an   contract.

 “It is (salaries) peanuts, frankly speaking,“ Shastri who was roped in as mentor and advisor by Greycells Education, told reporters here on Monday . “How much do the Aussies get?“ he added.
 
 Citing the example of  , who despite being India's top scorer in Tests this season had no takers during the IPL auction, the ex-India captain said: “The Board should ensure that players like Pujara are paid well. A player like Pujara should not waste time thinking whether he gets an IPL contract or not. The grade contracts of a Test player should be the highest. Pujara should be the highest paid, at par with top players. The `A' grade contracts have to be massive.“
