NEW DELHI: Train travel from Hazrat   will soon be a new experience altogether. Much like New  , a major revamp is under way at Hazrat   too, with a view to enhance passenger experience through improved facilities and easier access. 

 To this effect, work is in progress on widening the entry to the station, renovation of rooms and toilets besides providing designated lanes for taxis and autos. Railway officials said the changes were being made by following a long-term action plan, just like it was done at the other two major stations in Delhi. Passengers could expect a “major difference” by June-end. “This is a part of our plan to improve passenger experience. Inside, the station will be beautified and outside congestion will be reduced,” a railway official said.
 
 
 
  
 
 The short- and long-term changes will also see the station switch to mechanised sweeping over the next 12 months apart from setting up of deluxe “pay and use” toilets and a special VIP lounge at Platform No. 1 by  . The railways had earlier carried out a study on all major stations in the capital to find deficiencies, following which an action plan was drafted by a special committee.
 
 Senior officials said Hazrat Nizamuddin was identified as a major point for several west- and southbound mail and express trains, including Rajdhani and Gatimaan Express, which originate and terminate there. “Modernisation of the   is being done to provide better facilities for passengers as it is a key station for us. Most changes will be completed in the next 12 months, which will see a lot of beautification carried out as well,” R N Singh, DRM, Delhi Division, said.
 
 TOI had earlier reported how the New Delhi railway station had been given an entirely fresh look with wall paintings, street art and a new colour scheme. The Nizamuddin station, too, would sport an orange and blue colour scheme, officials said.
