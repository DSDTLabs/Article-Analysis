It is no secret that most people in the film industry are sentimental. A newbie actor or actress is called lucky when their film becomes a hit and branded unlucky if their film flops and so on. Stars, too, have their little sentiments, which they follow when they take up a new project. And   is no different.

 Recently, the actress let us in on one of her sentiments — she never talks about a new film she has signed unless it has gone on the floor. “Yes, I believe in such things, because I’ve seen it happen to my friends. They would be about to sign a film and something wouldn’t work out and they wouldn’t be part of it. Forget signing, until I’m on the set for the film’s shoot, I prefer not to tell anyone on being a part of a project,” says the   girl, who, we hear, has signed a Telugu film now, but doesn’t want to reveal any details about it because she fears she might jinx it.
 
 The actress is currently shooting for Santhanam’s  , which is directed by   of Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya fame. She plays an investigative journalist in the film.
