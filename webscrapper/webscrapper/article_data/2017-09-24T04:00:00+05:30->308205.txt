Rajkot:   

 According to officials of Mahila police station, where the FIR in this connection has been filed by the girl, the boy used to be her classmate. The girl studies in Mumbai and had come to Rajkot to spend her vacation with her family. 
 
 “The girl said that she was friends with the boy who used to often talk to her over phone. On April 23, the boy offered to take her on a bike ride and took her to Krishna Hotel near bus station, where he threatened to kill her parents and took off his and her clothes and clicked their seminude photographs. Blackmailing her on the basis of the photographs, the boy raped the girl twice at the hotel,” an official from Mahila police station said. 
 
 Eventually, tired of the blackmail, the girl confided her sordid story to her parents, who took her to Mahila police station and lodged a complaint against the boy.
