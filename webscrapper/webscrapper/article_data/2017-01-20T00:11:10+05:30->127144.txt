 The Thane collector’s office, district mining office, MPCB and explosives department will take part in the meeting scheduled on Friday to thrash out the contentious issue. “We will current status of mining and find out how much was allowed and how much has been quarried,” said officials. 
 
 The   (MoEF) had given mining rights for 20 years, till 2026. This has made   owners look at the possibility of another extension, as the first 10-year rights granted by Cidco lapsed last September. Cidco has given two three-month extensions since then that lapses on March 31 this year.
 
 The meeting will address the long-pending issue of the condition of the hill with environmentalists and citizens. Most locals have raising concern over the possibility of the hill already having been mined to its optimum capacity.
 
 Joint MD (Cidco), Prajakta Lavangare Varma told TOI on Thursday, “Cidco permit of 10-year lease has lapsed. We have given temporary extensions. But further extension would be subject to discussion, after taking various issues into account.’’
 
 However, NMMC as a planning and development body has taken strong exception to the “unilateral decision of Cidco stand” over extending lease rights and the disappearing green cover and eco system of the  . 
 
 “A scientific study is a must to ascertain the condition of the hill before granting any further extension,’’ said a civic official.
 
 President of Navi Mumbai quarry owners association, Namdeo Thakur, said, “We also care for the environment and the city, and are ready to abandon the quarrying business. But Cidco must provide us with alternatives such as plots to carry out other alternative business. Most of the 94 quarry leases were granted by Cidco way back in 1981-83.”
