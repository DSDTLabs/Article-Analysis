CHANDIGARH: Leader of the opposition in the   assembly and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA   on Thursday lashed out at the alleged autocratic appointment being made by the state government of six Punjab Public Service Commission ( ) members and two right to information (RTI) commissioners without following proper procedure.

 Khaira said he was surprised to see that special secretary of the personnel department approached him a couple of days ago to append his signatures on a file containing the names of six PPSC members and two RTI commissioners cleared by the chief minister and the   speaker.
 
 Stating that he was not a rubber stamp,   said he was astonished that the chief minister wanted the leader of opposition to approve names by casually circulating them for such important constitutional appointments without holding a meeting of the select committee.
 
 Khaira added that he directed the officer to show him the entire file of proceedings adopted by the government, as to how they shortlisted these names out of more than 150 applicants.
 
 Khaira urged the chief minister to reconsider these appointments, call an appropriate meeting of the chief minister, speaker and the leader of opposition to decide afresh.
