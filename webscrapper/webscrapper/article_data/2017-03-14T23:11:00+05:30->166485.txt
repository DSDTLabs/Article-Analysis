Jamshedpur: The movement launched by a section of the tribal outfits against the amendments in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Acts could take a violent turn, former MP   said on Tuesday.

 “Although near 90 percent of the tribal community is ignorant about how the amendment will affect their lives, they assume the government has come with a provision to grab their ancestral land which has angered them,” Murmu, who was presiding over a Jharkhand Dishom Party meeting, said.
 
 The veteran tribal leader said the tribal community believes that 28 tribal MLAs, cutting across political affiliation, are squarely responsible for allowing the proposal to be passed by the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) easily and subsequently in the assembly in 2016. 
 
 “Anger is growing against the MLAs who have got elected from the constituencies reserved for the tribals,” Murmu said. 
 
 In response to a query, Murmu claimed that in each of his public meetings, he made an ardent appeal to the crowd to not indulge in violence to get their voice heard. 
 
 “But the ground swelling against the tribal MLAs could take anugly turn in the next few months,” the tribal leader said.
