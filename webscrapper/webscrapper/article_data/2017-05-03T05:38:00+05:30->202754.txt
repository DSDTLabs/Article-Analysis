Nagpur: Cyclists can hope for an unhindered run in the city, initially at least near the Ambedkar ground near Laxmi Nagar. Adopting the street design concept used in developed countries, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation has come up with a new design for a footpath which will have a  .

 NMC executive engineer Mahesh Gupta told TOI that the old footpath on South Ambazari Road has been demolished. “It will be replaced with the new design. Construction of the new footpath is part of the cement work going on between Laxmi Nagar Square and Rahate Colony Square,” he said, adding that the new design will be implemented “wherever possible”.
 
 Gupta added that the outgoing municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had given an in-principal approval for the new design. “We engaged Collective Urbanism Design Consortium, an association of urban planners, for helping develop smart footpaths, traffic junctions, cycle lanes etc as a part of the Smart City Project. The new design will be barrier-free,” he said.
 
 The executive engineer added that there was scope for more such footpaths as cement road work is going on at many places. “The new design will be put in place even on the 6km Smart Strip (Japanese Garden Square to Khamla Square) wherever possible,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the NMC is set to complete work on a model Smart Traffic Junction at Raja Rani Square in Civil Lines. Gupta said all major junctions of the city will be developed on the same model. 
 
 “The junction will have special stop-line for cycles, two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The pedestrian lane is created in such a manner that there will be no obstruction in vehicular movement nor inconvenience and also no inconvenience to pedestrians,” he said.
