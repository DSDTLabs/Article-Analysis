LUCKNOW: A day after keeping police on their toes, class XII Anuj Kumar returned home on Friday. Afraid that he may not do well in the exam, he staged his own kidnapping.

 In the meantime, he had informed his father, Madhukar, on phone that five youths had stopped him on the way to school and whisked him away in a car. Then he switched his phone off. "He returned home around 12.30am on Friday and his father informed us," said Verma.
 
 Kumar told police that he had no interest in physics. 
 
 "I have always wanted to become a sportsperson for which studies are of no use. The education system in our country does not support sports.

 Police also said that Anuj's classmates were interrogated who said he had not gone to take his exam while his the last location of his mobile was traced to Charbagh.
 
 Anuj and his family live on rent near Ramleela ground in Madiaon and studies in  , Jankipuram. On Thursday, Anuj's father had got a call from him about his abduction and had asked his brother-in-law Munna Lal for help who had informed the UP 100.
