LUCKNOW: In an apparent bid to put the Ram temple issue back in spotlight, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) is gearing up for a grand show of strength by planning to double the number of participants in its flagship ' ' in Ayodhya starting on Saturday. 

 The VHP has called upon all units to send activists and supporters in large numbers for the 265 km yatra covering five districts of UP.
 
 Starting from Makhauda, about 17 km from Ayodhya, the nearly month-long yatra sees participants chant 'mantras' and sing 'bhajans' while walking alongside a chariot - 'Ram Rath' - with a projector displaying stories from Ramayan. The participants, under the aegis of Hanuman Mandal, a VHP-affiliated organisation, will walk barefoot for 15-20 km each day. The yatra will pass through Basti, Ambedkarnagar, Barabanki and Gonda.
 
 VHP spokesman,   confirmed that a call has been given to most states, including some in Northeast. Sharma said that VHP expected support from state government. "We hope the administration would provide requisite security," he said.
 
 The ' ' was mired in controversy in 2013 when   government did not give VHP the permission to organize the event citing security reasons and VHP leaders Ashok Singhal, Praveen Togadia, Ram Vilas Vedanti and BJP leader Vinay Katiyar were taken into preventive custody as they attempted to defy the ban.
