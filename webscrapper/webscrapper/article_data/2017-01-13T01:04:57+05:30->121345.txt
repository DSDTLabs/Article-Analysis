 Udhagamandalam: People’s Welfare Front, comprising CPI, CPM and VCK, on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the Nilgiris collector, demanding inclusion of small tea farmers in the schemes to be announced for drought-hit people.
 
 Pointing out that tea was not covered under drought and hence small tea farmers, it urged the collector to conduct a thorough survey in the district and recommend compensation for them under drought schemes.
 
 “We want the authorities to fix   as they have done it for paddy farmers. It shouldn’t be lees than Rs20,000 per acre of tea garden,” CPM district secretary R Bhadri told TOI.
 
 As far as Ooty is concerned, the memorandum said, land documents were very complicated as most farmlands fall either under Section 17 or 53 of Janmam Act (i.e., revenue and joint patta lands). “Hence the administration should take steps to identify the farmers without demanding relevant land documents,” it said.
 
 K N Bellan, a small tea farmer from Ithalar village, told TOI, “Monsoon failure, coupled with severe frost, damaged the tea plants. We got only around 300kg of green leaf tea per acre in December, against the usual yield of 3,000kg. We have lost 90% of the yield. And the small tea farmers hadn’t had any income in the past two months.”
 
 CPI district secretary A Bellie said a separate petition in this regard would be sent to the government. “Tea is not covered under drought. It is an irony. If no step is taken in this regard, People’s Welfare Front will stage a protest, which would see participation of all farmers of the hill district, at the collectorate in February,” he said.
 
 The People’s Welfare Front has also plans to hold taluk wise agitations on January 30.
