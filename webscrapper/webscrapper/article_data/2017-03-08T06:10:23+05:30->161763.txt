AHMEDABAD: Student bodies,   (ABVP) and   (NSUI) on Tuesday staged a protest after   officials indefinitely postponed the elections for student senate body and welfare board. 

 Earlier, M N Patel, the former vice-chancellor of the university, had postponed the elections twice. Himanshu Pandya, the in-charge vice- chancellor, who had earlier announced March 26 as the date for elections, issued a notification on Monday that the elections would be postponed. 
 
 Interestingly, while the election dates were declared on March 26, the reservation was not implemented by the varsity official as the state government approval was pending.
