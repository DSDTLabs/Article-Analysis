NEW DELHI:   Green Tribunal on Friday directed airport operators DIAL as well as authorities like   and the ministry of civil aviation to file a detailed affidavit on the action being taken by them on implementing noise barriers, greening of sidelines, restriction in use of reverse thrust and on dumping of waste by aircrafts before landing.

 The directions were issued by a bench lead by NGT chairperson   after an affidavit was submitted by DIAL on the work being carried out for noise reduction. They further informed the bench that work had been awarded to IIT on April 21, 2017 to carry out a study on the feasibility of noise barriers. However, on objections raised by petitioner  , who stated that a study on the same had already been conducted by IIT in 2010, the bench has directed the authorities to come up with details of the earlier report. The next date of hearing has been fixed for May 30.
