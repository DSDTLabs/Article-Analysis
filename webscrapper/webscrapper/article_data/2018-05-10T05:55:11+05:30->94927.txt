LUCKNOW: Following the suicide attempt by a junior resident of King George's   ( ) allegedly due to work pressure on Monday morning, the Resident Doctor's Association (RDA) on Wednesday asked the vice-chancellor to fix a maximum of 48 hours of work per week for every resident doctor and also grant them a  . 

 In a letter to the VC, the RDA also pointed out that after every night duty, a resident should be given a full day off from work the next day. Besides, they asked for one stretch of duty to be limited to eight hours and in an emergency situation, to 12 hours. 
 
 They said the demands, put forward by the RDA on behalf of all students and resident  , were necessary to create a healthy environment at work and for good mental health of the residents. 
 
  "Similar guidelines were maintained under an earlier Supreme Court order and the central government's residency scheme. Even then, it is not followed. We usually work for 30 hours straight. There is practically no off unless we take leave, which is very difficult to get. This is when the abnormal amount of work pressure, harassment and exploitation make someone take a drastic step," said RDA general secretary Dr Neeraj Mishra. 
 
 The letter, emailed to the official address of the VC, also mentions that if during work, a senior tortures or physically or verbally abuses a junior, it should be considered ragging and a case of mental harassment of a resident. It should be dealt with in the strictest manner, it added.
