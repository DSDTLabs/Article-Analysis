GUWAHATI:   of Bomdilla in   became on Sunday the first woman to claim “dual ascent” of   twice within a span of five days. She broke the previous record of Nepal’s Chhurim Sherpa, who had climbed Mt Everest twice in a week in 2012.

 The 37-year-old is also the first Indian woman to climb Mount Everest for the fifth time. Anshu’s expedition was flagged off by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on April 4 in Guwahati.
 
 At the Everest base camp, general secretary of Everest Summitteers Association, Lhakpa Rangdu Sherpa, announced that Anshu, a mother of two, reached the top of the world’s highest mountain at 7.45am on Sunday, setting the record for a double ascent in a single season.
 
 Dawa Sherpa Lama, managing director at Dream Himalaya Adventures, which conducted the expedition, told TOI from Kathmandu, “Anshu Jamsenpa, along with our veteran Sherpas, scaled Everest today 7.45am. It was a world record for Anshu — two double ascents by a woman and fastest double ascent of Mt Everest by a woman.” Tsering Wange, Anshu’s husband and the president of the Arunachal Mountaineering and Adventure Sports Association (AMSA), said she is in good health. “Although she is a bit exhausted, she is doing fine, and is likely to reach the base camp on Monday evening,” Wange told TOI.
 
 Anshu had created her first mountaineering record by climbing Mount Everest on May 12 in 2011 and again on May 21 the same year, becoming the first mother in the world to summit the world’s highest peak twice within 10 days. In 2013, Anshu had again scaled the peak. Anshu had made a fourth attempt to scale the peak in 2015, but had to call off her expedition midway due to the earthquake that struck Nepal.
