MADURAI: A 63-year-old woman, who desperately wanted to have a child, has delivered a baby girl through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) process, though she had to face many complications.

 
 Speaking to reporters in Madurai on Thursday, chief doctor of the  , Dr  , said that   and her husband Krishnan, 71, of Erode, had approached her about two years ago after she had successfully treated someone known to the couple for infertility. 
 
 As Senthamilselvi had reached menopause and they were both senior citizens, they were informed of the consequences of having a child at this age but they were determined and asked sought her help to have a child of their own after nearly 42-years of their marriage. 
 
 They had approached many treatment centres earlier but to no avail.
 
 Senthamilselvi was diabetic and she was treated for the same before the IVF process was started. The couple was made to undergo a series of tests, which revealed that Senthamilselvi had an unexplained infertility, but her uterus was healthy. As they were found fit to undergo IVF, the procedures were started. 
 
 As it was a high-risk pregnancy, she was kept under continuous medical supervision and had to be treated for postpartum haemorrhage.
 
 However, she delivered a healthy 3.50kg baby girl on May 21 through the caesarean section. “Both mother and child are doing well,” added Dr Senthamarai Selvi.
