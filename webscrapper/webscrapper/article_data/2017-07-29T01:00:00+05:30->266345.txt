 Srinivas, who grew to fame after   for AR  , has something new to offer. We must have heard several forms of Thillana, isn’t it? But Sharanya has come up with a new video, Thillana 2.0 —  , where she has worked with  , an Indian classical fusion musician.

 Talking about her version, she says, “A Thillana is a rhythmic dance piece in the Carnatic music tradition. Here, we present Swathi Thirunal’s (1813-46) popular Dhanashree Thillana with a modern twist. This has been one of the most exciting collaborations ever. I recorded my vocals followed by the music production. We shot the video in Mumbai. This was one of the quickest of collaborations that I have ever been part off.” 
 Sharanya is a huge admirer of Mahesh’s work, so it is not surprising that they worked together for this track. “I have seen several of Mahesh’s videos on YouTube. He’s simply amazing. I had contacted him and he was more than happy to work with me,” shares Sharanya, who always wanted to work on independent music. “Initially, I didn’t have a song in mind. But when this came up, we decided it would be perfect. These numbers are very popular among dancers as well,” she says.
 
 Ask her if classical songs with a modern twist are the trend these days and Sharanya says, “I totally agree. I feel there is a huge generation gap and the patience level among youngsters have gone down. And any classical tune with a modern twist or arrangement is what the present generation likes. People are more open to experimenting and like to listen to different interpretations. They don’t mind changing the rules a bit.” Sharanya recently crooned a number for Sridevi’s, Mom.
