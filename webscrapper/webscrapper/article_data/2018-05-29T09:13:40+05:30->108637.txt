CHENNAI: Although the   application process was made completely online last year itself, a number of parents are still struggling to find their feet when it comes to online procedures that are to be followed. A week after 1.28 lakh RTE applications were received by the government, lots for admissions were drawn across schools in the state on Monday to admit children under the RTE quota. The education department has also been strict about implementing RTE admission guidelines this year as applicants residing beyond the one km radius of the school (as per the RTE rule) were denied admissions. Under the Right To Education (RTE) Act, 25% of seats have to be reserved for admitting students from underprivileged sections in private schools. 

 S  , a parent who was seeking admission for her daughter in   matriculation school,  , said that she had to ask her nephew to fill the application for her since she isn't well-versed with the internet and complained of server errors. 
 
 The RTE portal was open from April 20 to May 18 and received a record number of applications this year. The department this year had also carried out awareness drives at the district level to educate applicants regarding the process. This was cited as one of the reasons for the high number of applications received.
 
 Despite this, not all parents were comfortable with the online process.  , another parent who had applied for his daughter's admission, said, "Initially we were confused about what documents were required to be submitted â€“ while the school asked for voter ID and some other documents, the online form needed Aadhaar card as proof for most requirements." 
 
  officials said when the applications are scrutinised, checking will be done on whether applicants have produced the required documents like community certificate and disability certificate in case of differently abled candidates, and eligibility determined accordingly.
