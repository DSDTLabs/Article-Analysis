 doesn't have to worry about an arrest in a nightclub fight here because a video shows he didn't touch the alleged victim, said the  's attorney. Drew Findling told media he has seen surveillance video from inside restaurant 1 Oak on   night last month, and it shows Quavo did not "come within three feet" of   the Jeweler. 

  
  
 He said the video does show an altercation, but Quavo wasn't involved. Eric said two men jumped him in the club, and possibly snatched his $30,000 chain. He claimed Quavo was one of the attackers. 
 
 Law enforcement sources told reporter that   Police Department was preparing to arrest the rapper for the fight. That's news to Findling, who said, based on the video, his client is in the clear.
 
 Findling also said the video shows Eric walk in the club with his chain, and walk out of the club with it still around his neck.
