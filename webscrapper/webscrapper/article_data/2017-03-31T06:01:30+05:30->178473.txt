GANDHINAGAR: After attending the state assembly on Thursday,  , Naranpura MLA, and BJP’s national president, drew added public attention by visiting the office of leader-of-opposition, Shankersinh Vaghela. CM Vijay Rupani and the president of BJP’s Gujarat unit, Jitu Vaghani, accompanied Shah. The saffron party leaders were in Vaghela’s office for about 20 minutes where they ostensibly shared small talk over tea and biscuits.

 When people from the media questioned Shah about the meeting’s purpose, he said, “It was only a courtesy visit.”
 
  On his part, Vaghela said, “Pradipsinh Jadeja(MoS, home) contacted me and informed that he (Shah) is likely to attend the assembly and would like to meet me for courtesy – something all leaders do.”“He along with Vijaybhai (CM) came here for tea only. It was a non-political meeting,’’ Vaghela said, adding, “I, too, had gone to wish former CM Anandiben Patel on her birthday, and she in turn had visited my office on my birthday.”Speaking about what took place in his meeting with Shah, Vaghela said, “We inquired about each other’s health. I asked him about his weight loss, and he told me he is on diet.”“Shah said that Narendrabhai, Keshubhai, and I are among most physically fit leaders,” Vaghela said.
 
 “Shah reiterated that the assembly elections in the state will be in November,” said Vaghela, adding, “There is no reason to blindly believe it and we must be ready. There is a word used by RSS, ‘vanchika’, which means to do something opposite to what projected, or to seed uncertainty.”“He also invited us for lunch. However, our MLAs declined as they were unhappy with the conduct of the Speaker during the question hour,” Vaghela said.
