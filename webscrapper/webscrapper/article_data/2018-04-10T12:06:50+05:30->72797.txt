PATNA: The Patna high court on Monday asked the central government to clarify its stand on the sale of books of private publishers from   ( )-affiliated schools.

 A division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, while hearing a PIL filed by one Deepak Kumar, allowed four weeks’ time to the central government to file a counter affidavit on the issue.
 
 The   issued the order after the CBSE submitted a supplementary counter affidavit on Monday, clarifying its stand on the continued sale of private publishers’ books in place of   books in schools. 
 
 CBSE’s counsel Vinay Krishna Tripathy told the court that the Delhi high court had quashed its circulars through which the CBSE had allowed sale of only NCERT books at the schools.
 
 Petitioner’s counsel Anju Mishra said many CBSE-affiliated schools allow sale of private publishers’ books from their campuses, while others pressurise parents to purchase them from market.
