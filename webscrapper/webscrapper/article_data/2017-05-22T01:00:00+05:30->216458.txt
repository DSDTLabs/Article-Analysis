The Rapid Metro isn’t the only new   carriage that Gurgaon has seen this year. A steam locomotive has rolled into Gurgaon. But no, you will not find it at the railway station or on the train tracks, for it is on display at the Heritage Transport   in  . The museum has acquired and restored a 1953 Jung Steam locomotive, giving Gurgaon its first fully-operational  .

 Standing at 12.5 feet tall and weighing 47 tonnes, the engine was built by a German company named Arnold Jung Lokomotivfabrik in 1953, and was among the six locomotives purchased by Bihar’s Rohtas Industries in the ’50s. It had been lying in a derelict condition in the company’s yard for over two decades, when the museum persuaded the Heritage Cell of the Indian Railways and acquired it last year. The restoration work on the engine was carried out by MS Rangaswamy, who had earlier restored the iconic Fairy Queen steam locomotive for the National Rail Museum. Rangaswamy and his team of engineers restored the locomotive over a six-month period starting in October last year. The engine was unveiled in front of the public earlier this week.
 
 Not only is the engine the first functional steam engine in Gurgaon, it is also the only fully-functional steam locomotive housed at a private museum in the country. According to the museum authorities, the engine was acquired and restored to promote and introduce the magic of the bygone era of steam railways to the current generation. The museum authorities say that they are in the process of adding another steam locomotive to their collection soon. “Restoration work on the museum’s other steam locomotive, a 1921 Kerr Stuart, will begin in the winter and it should be operational by next year,” a spokesperson from the museum told us.
