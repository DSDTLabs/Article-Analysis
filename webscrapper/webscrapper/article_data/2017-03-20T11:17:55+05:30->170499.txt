They require you to remember the dates, terminology and long answers on various battles and policies. But do not worry at all, be calm and all you should do is practice by writing as much as you can. This will help you remembering the dates. Also prioritize your subjects and topics according to marks weight-age, easy, difficult chapters, and prepare accordingly. Take notes for specific points you feel are important and you are likely to forget, in addition to school notes. Always write neatly by giving proper space between every answer.
