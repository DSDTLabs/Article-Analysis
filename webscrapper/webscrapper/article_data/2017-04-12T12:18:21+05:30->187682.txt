Singer   says he likes being in a band more than performing solo. 

 The 27-year-old singer, who is part of   group  , said it is overwhelming to fly solo. 
 
  
  
 
 "It can be pretty stressful and overwhelming, and I think there's a lot more competition when you're solo. 
 
 "I've always felt comfortable being surrounded by really talented, hard-working individuals and I've been lucky to meet three of them again in my life who love this and work just as hard as me, and also have just as much fun. That's key for us," Jonas said. 
 
 DNCE have announced their new single featuring   called 'Kissing Strangers' and have promised they will drop new music to follow up their 2016 self-titled debut LP in the not so distant future. 
 
 "We've been working on lots of new music. We don't have a set idea of when and what we're going to release because we're still vibing on this first record, but we've been excited to get something out there and continue to create. 
 
 "On tour it's hard to find studio time and our few days off we end up passing out. But it's not too far away that people will be able to hear new stuff," he said.
