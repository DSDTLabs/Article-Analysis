ALLAHABAD:   has just started and it was obvious on day one that the district administration’s plan that only kulhads would be used to serve tea or coffee hadn’t found many takers. 

 Every teastall owner in the area was serving hot beverages in plastic or cardboard cups despite the instructions that they were supposed to sell the same only in kullhads.
 
 Way before the mela started, the district administration had claimed they would ban the use of plastic or thermocol cups. 
 
 The mela authorities, on their part, had also decided to constitute special teams comprising lekhpals who would not only keep an eye on eateries but would also conduct surprise raids to check the usage of plastic or thermocol. Some shopkeepers had worked their way around that possibility too; they stock kulhads in case an official dropped in to check on them.
 
 “Authorities pass such instructions every year but no action is ever taken. Those selling kulhads have also increased the rates. They charged Rs 25-30 for 100 pieces but have hiked the price to Rs 60 for the same number now,” said a shopkeeper. 
 
 District magistrate   said, “From now on, whosoever is found flouting instructions would be thrown out after they’ve paid the fine. There won’t be any second chances.”
