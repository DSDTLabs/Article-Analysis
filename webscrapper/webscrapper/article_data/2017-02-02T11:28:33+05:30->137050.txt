BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister   described the Union budget as a revolutionary step for a progressive India. He said the budget will increase the pace of development and growth to help poor and marginalised people.

 “I congratulate Prime Minister   and finance minister Arun Jaitley for bringing such a comprehensive change in the life of common man. The budget proposals would bring encouraging results in the country's economy and fulfil the dreams of youth, women and traders,” tweeted Chouhan on the budget reforms. The chief minister further said that budget proposal to remove service charges on rail bookings on the country's largest e-commerce site IRCTC, would make rail journey more blissful for the passengers.
 
 In a relief to start-ups, he said, the budget would also help youths fulfil their dreams by extending the time period for availing tax benefit for three years in the first seven years of existence. A record allocation of Rs 48,000 crore has been made for MNREGA. This will help realise the dream of the poor and create assets in rural India, said Chouhan. 
 
 He said that the budget proposal to establish 100 India International Skills Centres (IISC) across the country would offer advanced training and courses in foreign languages to the youths. This will help those who seek job opportunities outside the country, he added.
