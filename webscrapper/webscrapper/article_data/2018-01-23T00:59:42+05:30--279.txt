Bundi: Senior Congress leader and former chief minister of Rajasthan Ashok   on Monday slammed BJP-led central government for politicising Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed film ‘Padmaavat’ to reap benefits in Gujarat polls. Gehlot was speaking to the media in Bundi circuit house on Monday morning.

 “The controversy over the film was intentionally twisted and harboured to reap benefits in Gujarat elections,” said the former CM.
 
 BJP-led central government politicised the film ‘Padmaavat’ to reap benefits of controversy in Gujarat elections, Gehlot said and claimed that the central government could have solved the issue earlier as the person heading Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) was an RSS volunteer and BJP leader and the matter could have been sorted out through negotiations between the government and concerned parties across the table. “But in order to reap benefits of the controversy over the movie in Gujarat polls, the central government delayed the attempts to sort out the issue and eventually it slipped out of control and Supreme Court had to intervene,” Gehlot added. He added, “Such intentions and efforts have adverse effect and spoil the environment of the country.”
 
 The movie was earlier banned in Madhya Pradesh and then in Rajasthan and after analysing the timing it was also banned in Gujarat, he said. Now everywhere in the country, calls and appeals are being delivered to ban the movie but such a situation should not have risen, had the government been a little sensitive and serious to the issue, Gehlot said.
 
 The artists and freedom of expression should be respected and maintained, he added. The government should ensure that sentiments of caste and religion of any person should not be hurt but the governments at Centre as well as in the state have failed to do so, Gehlot added.
