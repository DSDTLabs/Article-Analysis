FAIZABAD: In   city, where   always got defeated by BJP by more than 1.5 lakh votes, the margin came down to 24,000 votes this time, said veteran SP leader and former   MLA Jai Shankar Pandey. 

 Pandey was the election in charge of Gorakhpur city for the bypolls.
 
 "Non-availability of kerosene oil and foodgrain, high rates of LPG, sky-high rates of emergency medicines, poor condition of farmers and stray cattle regularly destroying crops were some small issues which played a big role in this election and resulted in the fall of the impregnable castle of Gorakhnath. 
 
 Pandey also predicted a grand alliance of Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress, Left parties and Lok Dal in the coming parliamentary elections. 
 
  "For the defeat of these fascist and anti-people forces, this grand alliance is the need... I am sure it will soon take final shape," said Pandey. 
 
 "In Gorakhpur, we came in contact with common people who complained they were not getting kerosene oil and foodgrain on yellow ration cards on control rates. High prices of LPG were also a concern," he said. 
 
 "People were also harassed by sky-high prices of medicines, specially emergency medicines," said Pandey.
 
 "The rural population was coming to the city to work as daily-wage labours. Stray cattle was destroying their crops," said Pandey.
