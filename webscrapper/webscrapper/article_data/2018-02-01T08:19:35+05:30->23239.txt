LUCKNOW: A year after trader   was shot dead, an eerie silence prevails in his house in  , Saadatganj. Eight armed constables guard the house round the clock.

 Shravan Sahu (58), an oil dealer, was at his shop in Daalmandi on February 1 last year when some men on motorbikes pumped bullets into his body. He died on the spot.
 
 Sahu was allegedly murdered by the aides of Aqeel Ansari, the prime accused in the murder case of his son Ayush. Aqeel had allegedly shot dead Ayush on October 16, 2013. Sahu was diligently pursuing the case and that had irked Aqeel, who was lodged in Lucknow jail.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Five people were arrested who confessed to killing Sahu at the behest of Aqeel, claimed police.
 
 In 2016 too, Sahu had survived a murder attempt by Aqeel. A few days before his murder, Sahu had demanded a gunner from then   Lucknow   but that got delayed due to red-tapism. The delay made Sahu vulnerable to the attackers.
 
 Sunil, his elder son, now runs the shop. “My father was killed for having faith in the system of justice,” said a teary-eyed Sunil. He blames police for not providing a gunner to his father.
 
 “Aqeel had threatened my father several times to withdraw the case, but he remained firm as he had complete faith in the law. He used to say that if the court gives a clean chit to Aqeel, he would accept it, else he would continue to fight for justice,” Sunil told TOI.
 
 Sahu’s younger brother Vijay said, “My brother followed the path of righteousness. I never thought he would meet such a brutal end.”
 
 Sahu’s wife Nirmala no longer talks to strangers as she fears they might be Aqeel’s men.
