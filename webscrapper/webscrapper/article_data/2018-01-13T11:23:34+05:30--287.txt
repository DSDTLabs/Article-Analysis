COIMBATORE: Police on Friday seized a truck carrying plastic waste from   for attempting to dump the load near the inter-state border in  .

 Anaimalai sub-inspector   and team conducting vehicle check along the   border had spotted the truck laden with sacks. “Alerted by the foul smell emanating from the sacks, we questioned truck driver Easwaran, a native of Ganapathypalayam. When Easwaran mumbled contradictory answers, we checked the contents of the sacks and found them stuffed with plastic waste,” a police officer said.
 
 On questioning, the driver revealed that he was carrying roughly three tonnes of plastic waste from   in Kerala. “He was planning to dump the waste in some desolate place in Anaimalai,” the officer said.
 
 Police arrested Easwaran and confiscated the truck.
 
 Police said that it has been the practice of several commercial establishments in Kerala to smuggle waste into   and dump them here. Police had mounted a round-the-clock vigil on all the vehicles passing through the checkposts to prevent smuggling of waste into Tamil Nadu.
