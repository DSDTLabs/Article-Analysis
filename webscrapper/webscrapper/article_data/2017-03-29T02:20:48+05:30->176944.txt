GURUGRAM: An   and his two friends were allegedly thrashed by   at a pub in   in the early hours of Tuesday for   for the day. Two of them sustained minor injuries.

 According to police, Rahul Laxman, who lives in the UK, and his two friends — Ishant Aggarwal and Sidharth — went to   in Cyber Hub, along with a woman, to spend an evening together. The woman left the pub after a few hours, but the trio stayed on.
 
 Around 1.30 am, when the bartender asked customers to leave, Rahul, Ishant and Sidharth insisted on having some more drinks. When the pub manager objected as they were closing for the day, the trio allegedly pushed him and refused to foot the bill. This led to an argument and soon the pub’s bouncers were called in, cops said.
 
 “We were at the bar and arguments broke out between us and the bar manager over the bill. We were trying to resolve the issue, but suddenly the bouncers attacked us. They even beat us with baseball bats, which left me with a broken tooth. Ishant sustained a cut on his neck,” Rahul said in his complaint.
 
 The three were rushed to a private hospital and discharged after first aid.
 
 On the basis of their complaint, an FIR has been registered against the unidentified bouncers of The Wine Company under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (unlawful assembly), 323 (causing hurt), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapon), 325 (for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at DLF-II police station.
 
 “We are investigating the matter. We have sought CCTV footage from the bar. Once we get the footage, we will verify the matter and then take action as per law,” said inspector Sudeep Kumar, SHO of DLF-II police station.
 
 Neither the bar owner, Ajay Gupta, nor the manager could be contacted. A junior employee of The Wine Company, Rani, said that the manager of the bar is on leave.
