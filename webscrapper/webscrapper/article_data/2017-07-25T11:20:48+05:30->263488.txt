JAIPUR Many girls who were witness to the tragic death of 19-year-old girl Aditi Sanghi on Monday morning inside the university campus chose to immediately leave for home while others were inconsolable.

 The incident took place at 10am when several students, including first-year ones, were making a beeline to take part in the adventure sport. However, as soon as Aditi fell to death, the others ran helter-skelter.
 
 “There were initial reports of the rope breaking from the building, leading to Aditi’s death. But when we came out of our classes, we saw her profusely bleeding and being taken to the hospital,” a student told TOI, adding that Sunil Sanghi, the girl’s father, quickly came downstairs to attend to her daughter.
 
 Shilpi (name changed), a first-year BA student, was among several others who were still in their classrooms when the news broke first. “I was in my regular class when another teacher ran into our classroom and informed our teacher about an accident in the college campus. We did not know know what exactly had happened,” she said, adding that when they reached the spot, the guards and other teachers instructed girls to go back to their classes.
 
 Equally aghast were nearby shopkeepers and auto drivers who witnessed Aditi’s fall from the   of the college. “I regularly take students from their hostels in   to the college. On Monday, after dropping students, I was waiting outside the college when I heard screams,” said Pratapmal Ranawat, an auto driver. He added that an ambulance arrived soon and the guards closed the doors of the gate.
 
 However, the latest incident also sent shockwaves among others students, especially the newcomers. The college teachers and other staff remained tight-lipped over the mishap.
