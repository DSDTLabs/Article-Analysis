The veteran actress-filmmaker returns to television after 11 years.
 
  After playing Sulochana in Ramesh Sippy’s 1986 drama,  , followed by Saahil, Junoon, Aur Phir Ek Din and Aisa Des Hai Mera,   returns to television after 11 years, with Siddharth P Malhotra’s soap, the tentatively-titled Utre Na Rang Mahi. She plays Rajmata Rajeshwari Singh Ranawat.
  
  “There’s nothing of a royal lady in me in real life. You see me mostly in jeans and tees. When Siddharth called, I wasn’t interested in television as it’s a lot of hard work. But the subject piqued my curiosity and since my next directorial, Love Affair, has been delayed, I took up the offer,” informs Soni, insisting that nothing has changed in the last decade except for the fact that soaps which were once larger-than-life and melodramatic are now more real in their themes and characters.
  
  
 
  
  Quiz her on why Love Affair has been put on the back-burner and she informs that it was a production call since it’s a period film and needs a substantial budget. “But I will revisit it sometime in the future,” she states.
  
  Meanwhile, there’s Utre Na Rang Mahi which both her daughters, Shaheen and Alia, are excited about and rubbished her complaints about it being tiring. When will we see Alia and her on screen together? “We’d love to work together but we’re more likely to act together than me directing Alia. Our relationship is so lovely; we don’t want to burden it with anything to do with films. Just because we have a star in the family doesn’t mean we have to make a film with her but if something interesting comes our way, why not,” she says.
