LUDHIANA: In another booster for the green plastic campaign of the Income Tax department, Ludhiana, another   has been started at the city’s renowned Hyatt Regency hotel under its Hyatt Thrive CSR Initiative.

 The initial project — in which close to 300 bottles and 400 saplings have been planted on the boundary wall of the hotel — was inaugurated on Thursday by chief commissioner of income tax (CCIT)  , along with additional commissioner Rohit Mehra and the hotel staff. The hotel’s general manager Manas Banerjee, PR manager  , human resources manager Harris Vinoj, assistant manager (learning) Abhinav Asthana, assistant manager (HR) TV Mukesh, members of Green Plastic Initiative Geetanjali Mehra and Manish Rai, were present on the occasion, besides others. 
 
 Lauding the hotel’s effort, Jha said: “This is a wonderful effort and the green plastic initiative has got another dimension today with the commencement of the vertical garden at Hyatt Regency, which is one of the most reputed hospitality brand worldwide. It is heartening to see a sense of responsibility for the environment, and the excitement displayed by the hotel staff. I’m sure this will help spread awareness and installation of more such gardens not just in Ludhiana, but across the globe.”

We are happy this effort will help spread awarenes among more people and stakeholders, and they will contribute their bit for the environment by taking up such initiatives.”
