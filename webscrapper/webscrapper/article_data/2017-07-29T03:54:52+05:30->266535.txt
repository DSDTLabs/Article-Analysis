NEW DELHI: Opposition parties have denied any discussions about jointly contesting the   Lok Sabha constituency, the centre of political speculation after BSP supremo   resigned from Rajya Sabha.

  and   sources said Mayawati had not evinced any interest in being the joint candidate of what is being talked about as the future ‘grand alliance’ in Uttar Pradesh. They said the issue never came up for talks and was only being speculated in the media.
 
 After their decimation in the recent assembly polls, SP, BSP and Congress have spoken about joining hands to take on   in the 2019   polls.
 
 A top Congress leader appeared to rule out the possibility, saying Mayawati may prefer to stay out of Parliament than shift to the lower chamber.
 
 No sooner did the BSP chief quit Rajya Sabha in protest against what she said was denial of opportunity to raise atrocities against Dalits than there were conjectures about her contesting in Phulpur.
 
 The seat is held by BJP MP   who is expected to resign after moving to the UP government as deputy chief minister.
 
 Phulpur has a good presence of Dalits where BSP, in company with SP and Congress, can pose a strong challenge to BJP. Any such experiment in Phulpur would also serve as dry run for a future ‘grand alliance’. If Phulpur does not happen, the suspense over a ‘grand alliance’ in UP may drag that bit further.
 
 Past animosity between Mulayam and Mayawati keeps casting a shadow on the alliance coming to fruition.
