KOLKATA: The dark clouds over the Kolkata sky on Sunday evening looked like they meant serious business, but the city ended up getting just a drizzle accompanied by some blustery winds, though there was a steady drizzle and a sharp shower in parts of south and central Kolkata around 10.30pm.

 And though most of the rain lashed south Bengal districts, the mercury level was dragged down by two notches. What's more, the Met says Monday's temperature would remain a couple of degrees below normal.
 
 “Whenever there are thunderstorm activities nearby, there is a down draft of cold winds coming down,“ said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, deputy director-general of meteorology at the Indian  . “That is why the mercury plunged a few degrees in Kolkata, though it did not rain much in the city,“ he added.
 
 Sources said heavy rain spared the city because of a combination of two things: the wind, which dissipated the clouds, and that the core of the moisture-laden cloud was not over Kolkata.
 
 A trough line extending from north to south Bengal that started developing from Saturday , accompanied by a cyclonic circulation over north Bengal, had caused the thunderclouds. Places in Midnapore, Bankura, Puru lia, Burdwan and Birbhum were lashed by the squall.
 
 “The core of the cloud was towards the south of Kolkata.Perhaps this explains why places like Digha was lashed by a hailstorm and there was only a drizzle or isolated rain in the city,“ said G K Das, director (weather),  , Kolkata. A man died after being struck by lightning in Bankura's Belpahari.
 
 The maximum temperature on Sunday at 33.7 °C, a degree below normal. On Monday, the maximum temperature will hover around the 31-degree mark. “We expect a clear sky on Monday,“ added Bandyopadhyay.
