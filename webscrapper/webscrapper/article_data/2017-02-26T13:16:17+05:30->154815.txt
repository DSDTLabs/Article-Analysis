GUWAHATI: The   ( )'s directive on the installation of   has reinforced the state transport department's aim to crack down on errant vehicles. 

 As per the latest guidelines of the board, school buses will now have to be equipped with GPS, CCTV cameras and speed governors to ensure safety of children.
 
 Secretary of the  , Kamrup (Metro),   told TOI that following the CBSE directive, the enforcement wing of the transport department would crack down on rowdy school buses. "We have already launched an operation against buses violating norms. It will be intensified," Kalita said and urged school authorities to comply with the guidelines. 
 
 In the absence of an enforcement wing and authority to supervise its directives, the CBSE had sought the help of transport departments. "State government agencies need to oversee the implementation of the guidelines issued by the CBSE since the education board does not have the manpower to monitor the activities of the school buses plying the roads," said a senior board official.
 
 The CBSE has even said violation of norms could lead to cancellation of affiliation. "The management and head of CBSE-affiliated schools will be held responsible for any lapse. This would invite appropriate action, including disaffiliation," CBSE deputy secretary (affiliation)   said.
 
 According to board guidelines, school bus drivers must have a minimum of five years' experience of driving heavy vehicles. The board further clarified that in case of hired buses, the school authorities need to sign a valid agreement with the owner or transporter of the vehicles.
