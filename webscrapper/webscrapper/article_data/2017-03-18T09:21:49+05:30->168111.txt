LUCKNOW: Axe is likely to fall on the services of nearly 70 chairmen, advisors and vice-chairmen, enjoying the status of a minister of state. Chief secretary   has got a list of such appointees prepared to present before the new chief minister.

 Sources told TOI that these “lal batti wallahs” are likely to lose their jobs if they don’t resign on their own. A similar action may follow soon on the officers getting extension and repeated extensions despite their retirement.
 
 Bhatnagar has collected the list of the political nominees in various departments and the PSUs. Some of them have already resigned, but a majority of them are still continuing. “I will present the list before the new chief minister,” he confirmed to TOI late on Friday night.
 
 A similar list of about 50 retired officers -- who are still sticking to their posts through extensions -- has also been prepared. “This list will also be presented before the new CM,” Bhatnagar said. Retired officers Alok Ranjan and NC Bajpai, who had been occupying different positions in the government, have already resigned and so has the advisor to the home department. But a large number of retired officers are still holding their offices.
