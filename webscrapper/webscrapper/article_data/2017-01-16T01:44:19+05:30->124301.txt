GREATER NOIDA: The   of Bisrakh village are likely to choose NOTA (none of the above) or even float a citizens’ representative in the forthcoming assembly elections in support of the ‘No House No Vote’ campaign by Noida extension  .

 The members of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association ( ) held a meeting with the representatives of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Bisrakh on Sunday, where they decided to join hands with them to take the campaign forward. They will discuss ways to support the homebuyers in the upcoming pre-election mahapanchayat, which will be held on Tuesday, farmers said.
 
 The entire region of Noida Extension, where over 58 builder projects are currently underway, is built on land acquired from Bisrakh villagers in Gautam Budh Nagar. The region falls in Dadri assembly constituency.
 
 “We have agreed to support homebuyers because we were used as a vote-bank before the elections. Now homebuyers will also be used when they come and settle down here,” Manveer Bhati, spokesperson, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, told TOI.
 
 “We will take our request to the panchayat and the villagers. We will appeal to them to cast NOTA. Alternatively, we may float a citizens’ representative to contest from Dadri and route all votes to him,” Bhati said.
