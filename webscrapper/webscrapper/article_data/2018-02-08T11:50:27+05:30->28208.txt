VADODARA: On the face of it, citizens may have been spared of   hikes in the recent budget, barring the cleanliness charges that they pay to the   ( ). But there is one factor that may lead to tax hikes that the budget does not mention and citizens may largely be unaware of.

 The catch lies in the fact that the multiplication factor that the VMC uses to calculate property tax includes one based on the class of the area where the property is located. The civic body has divided the city into four classes – A, B, C and D – depending on the rates of properties in these areas. 
 
 The municipal commissioner has the discretion of making any changes in these classes and does not need a formal nod from the elected wing. 
 
 In the classification, ‘D’ that has a value of 0.90 stands for areas where the property rates are least while ‘A’ that has a value of 1.60 stands for areas that have the highest property values in the city. The civic body can make changes in the factor every four years. There are several areas in the city where this has not been done for quite some time now. VMC officials said the commissioner was authorised in 2003 to make changes in the zones. Since then the change in the class multiplier has been made on three occasions.
 
 With the VMC desperately looking to raise revenue, many believe that the class multipliers may be tweaked this time around to rake in some more money. At the face of it, the VMC commissioner is authorised to make the changes, but in practice this is done by taking the elected wing into confidence. The standing committee of the civic body had recently struck down tax hikes proposed by the administration in the draft budget. It only gave a nod for cleanliness charges to be charged by the civic body.
