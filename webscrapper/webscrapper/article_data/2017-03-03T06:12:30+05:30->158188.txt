MALAPPURAM: Schoolchildren trying to hitch a ride with strangers—ignoring occasional advisories from the police—is a common sight across the state.

 Realizing the dangers involved, the deputy director of education (DDE) in Malappuram has now issued a circular to   to initiate steps to stop children from requesting—or accepting—free rides.
 
 The circular was issued in the backdrop of increasing complaints that school students were being misused by drug and sex rackets that offer free rides in the mornings and evenings.
 
 The DDE has asked educational institutions to discuss the issue in school assemblies, besides adequately advising their students.
 
 A meeting of   (DCPU) held a week ago decided to strictly implement its plan to prevent students from accepting, from strangers, rides to or from schools.
 
 The meet observed that most students were unaware of the consequences. The DCPU would also conduct awareness programmes for parents.
 
 According to the district child protection officer,  , a significant number of school students including girls, irrespective of urban- rural divide, have been depending on private vehicles—mostly motorbikes and cars, for reaching their schools on time and also to return home.
 
 They preferred   to using school bus or public transport since it helped them save money and time.
 
 “Students trying to flag down private vehicles is a regular sight in the district. They are not worried about the consequences. Some rackets are misusing them for anti-social activities by regularly offering them rides,” he said.
 
 He said some students were using money thus saved on drugs and liquor. He added that a racket that regularly offered lifts were behind some of the recent incidents of kidnapping in the district.
