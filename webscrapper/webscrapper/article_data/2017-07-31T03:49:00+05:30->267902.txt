Panaji: Issues related to infrastructure for the villages, illegal structures on comunidade land and inundation of fields in the khazan land dominated the gram sabha of Azossim-Mandur panchayat on Sunday.

 The low rate of house tax for smaller houses generated some heat, as members demanded reassessment to fix new rates. Po agreed to carry out an exercise to review the quantum of tax.
 
 An allegedly illegal structure in comunidade land irked some members, as they sought to know how it was granted to a house number. It was agreed that villagers and panchayat members should jointly inspect the site and even seek explanation from the previous sarpanch.
 
 Regarding the dilapidated market complex, Po announced that a new one will be built for shops and it would have a gym and other facilities.
 
 A female member alleged that tenants of one of the sluice gates have not been paid compensation for years, despite flooding of their fields. “We should oppose the auction for sluice gate rights,” she said. Further, she alleged that the auction was being held in a hush-hush manner. Others alleged that their fields are being flooded and even a survey cannot be done.
