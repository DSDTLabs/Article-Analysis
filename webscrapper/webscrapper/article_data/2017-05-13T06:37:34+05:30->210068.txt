THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government on Friday decided to cancel the state police chief's order transferring a junior superintendent from the department's confidential section to the special armed police camp. 

 Shifting junior superintendent Beena Kumari from the police's T-Section was one of the transfer orders director-general of police T P   had ordered after he was reinstated as the state's top cop based on a Supreme Court order.The government decided to act on the DGP's transfer order citing that it was now impractical to transfer officials from the police headquarters. An order on the cancellation was yet to be issued.
 
 Sources, however, said the government had directed the DGP to maintain status quo.
 
 Beena Kumari, who refused to oblige to the transfer order, had lodged a complaint to the chief secretary, saying it was not legal to shift her before she completed three years of service in that particular post.
 
 Senkumar had on Thursday clarified his stand on the transfer to chief minister   and chief secretary Subratha Biswas. The T-Section deals with sensitive and confidential files.
 
 Senkumar argued that the state police chief had the power to appoint an officer of his choice in the confidential section. He had also claimed that Beena Kumari had committed serious lapses in processing a petition filed by Koduvally MLA Karat Razack.
 
 Sources said an officer, entrusted to probe Senkumar's allegations, gave a clean chit to Beena Kumari after it was found that she had promptly forwarded the petition to the intelligence department. But, Senkumar suppressed the finding, sources said.
 
 Senkumar, who was appointed the state police chief by the previous   government, was replaced by   as soon as Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government came to power.
 
 Instead of assuming charge of his new office, he went on leave and fought a successful legal battle, which culminated in Supreme Court ordering the government to reinstate him on April 24.
