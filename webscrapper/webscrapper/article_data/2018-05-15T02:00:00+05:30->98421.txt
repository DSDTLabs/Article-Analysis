PATNA: Candidates appearing for polytechnic entrance examination conducted by the Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board (BCECEB) were in for a shock when the invigilators at some examination centres at Bettiah in West Champaran district allegedly asked them to write papers without wearing shirts and shoes on Monday.

 Collars of some of the candidates were snipped off by the invigilators. Male candidates were asked to remove their shirts, shoes and socks before entering the examination hall. Sleeves, patch work and tags from dresses of women candidates were also snipped off with scissors and blades at some centres.
 
 Some female candidates, who resisted the disciplinary measures, were allegedly asked to keep quiet. Girls were asked to remove their hair pins, hairbands and ornaments like earrings and nose pins.
 
 “My son was forced to take off his shirt. The invigilators told him that he will not be allowed to write papers if he refuses to take off his shirt,” said father of one of the examinees outside an examination centre at Bettiah. 
 
 An official of the education department said action would be taken against the schools and the invigilators concerned for asking the candidates to remove their shirts. “These schools will not be allowed to hold competitive examinations in future,” the official added.
 
 Earlier, the invigilators snipped off the sleeves of the dresses of women candidates who appeared for the nursing entrance exam of BCECEB at some of the centres in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and Purnia districts on Saturday.
 
 The BCECEB conducts exams across the state every year for admission to various medical, engineering and agriculture courses.
