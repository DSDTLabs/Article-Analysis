CHENNAI:   send dozens of   on foreign tours every year to upgrade their knowledge of railway systems across the world. But not many receive the hero’s welcome   got on Wednesday. The Salem railway divisional manager had just returned from Italy.

 Verma was welcomed with a garland, a crown and many bouquets by officers, staff and members of various unions. The Erode railway school headmaster went a yard further and got schoolchildren to perform folk dance to welcome the official. Why not, for the official too was returning from a school— the  , Milan, Italy. Someone pointed out that the headmaster was happy that the official had been kind to the school when it came to deserving funds and facilities.
 
 An officer said the ceremony was a truncated version of what was originally planned— a procession from the Salem station to the divisional manager’s office. “But he (Verma) got wind of it and came an hour early to his office,” said an official. If the official has to be believed, Verma was modest. The Salem railway division wasn’t. It put out an official press release about the divisional manager’s return, complete with photographs, on its social media page.
 
 A brass band played the traditional welcome and finishing music as Verma was taken in a procession. Some onlookers said they mistook it for a marriage procession. Some others thought a war hero had returned. An official in another division clearly wasn’t appreciative of the grand show when he called it “sycophancy, the curse of the political system in Tamil Nadu”.
 
 When a netizen shared the sentiment on the division’s Facebook page, the administrator replied: “There are lakhs of students (who) pass higher secondary and secondary exams that too with top honors. Right? But, if a girl or boy from our home passes with good marks, we are proud of it and celebrate it. Are we not? (sic) Likewise, he is our Head of the Family. So, we celebrated his return, that too within our office premises.”
