Dindigul: People coming across encroachments in water bodies can register their complaints through WhatsApp, email and petitions so that immediate action can be taken against the offenders, Dindigul collector T N Vinay has said

 In a press statement, he said that monsoons had failed the district for the past few years, resulting in water bodies drying up and the level of the groundwater receding fast. Since the monsoons have failed, protecting and maintaining them are very important to save and conserve the water.
 
 In all grievance day meetings held in the district, farmers state that the reason for the drought and failure of crops is the lack of maintenance of the water bodies which are encroached by the people. Livelihood of farmers and many other industries which were dependent on agriculture were destroyed due to lack of maintenance of water bodies. Hence, people should voluntarily come forward to clear them of any encroachment and the district administration is also taking action against them, he said.
 
 The collector urged the people to provide information on the encroachments through WhatsApp on 9600482870, email paagridgl@gmail.com, or petitions by sending photographs along for faster action. He also said that people help the district administration in this endeavour and help to identify and remove encroachments. TNN
