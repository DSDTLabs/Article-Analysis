Puri Jagannadh's much-awaited film '
 ' released today. Starring his son   and   in lead roles, the film features music by Sandeep Chowta.

 The story of the film is meant to be the epic love story of Roshan (Akash Puri) and Afreen (Neha Shetty). Roshan is a Hyderabadi with an undying zeal to join the Army, much to his father's ( ) chagrin. He keeps having recurring dreams since childhood of him being a soldier but being killed because of his love for another. Kind of tolerant, he is the apple of his mother and friends' eyes. Afreen (Neha Shetty) is a Pakistani who comes to India as an exchange student. Docile and calm, she is stuck in an abusive relationship with her fianc√© (Vishu Reddy). She too has recurring dreams of dying due to the love she has for another.
 
 While it's really not hard to connect the dots as to where this story is heading, ' ' takes its own sweet time setting up the story. It is on before the interval that the reincarnation plot is revealed, featuring a gruesome frozen dead body and subpar CGI.
 
 It is strange that instead of a tight narrative,   would choose the slow and steady path for a story like this. Swathed in red and neutral tints, the cinematography so far though is a win. The film so far has been as docile as Neha Shetty's character and is in need of a high and some oomph, which will hopefully come in the second half.
