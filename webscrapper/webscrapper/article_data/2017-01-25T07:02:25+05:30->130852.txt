BENGALURU: Chaos prevailed at   on the yet-to-be commissioned southern corridor near   on Monday night when a security guard came across a ‘bomb-like object’ in the second floor of the building. 

 Police personnel headed by deputy commissioner of police (south) S D Sharanappa rushed to the spot by 9.20pm and bomb detection squad personnel inspected the object before declaring it a handmade cracker.
 
 “Wires and tiny metals were stuffed inside an empty ice cream ball, made of plastic. One fuse wire was popping out,” a senior officer said.
 
 Police commissioner   visited the spot on Tuesday morning, inspected the cracker and interacted with the Metro officials as well as jurisdictional police.
 
 Officials suspect nomads specializing in hunting and frequenting areas in and around Banashankari might have dropped the object while passing by. “But how did the object reached the second floor is the question,” police said. 
 
 Nomads use such crackers in lakes to kill fish and eat them, they added.
 
 “We cannot rule out the possibilities of pranksters trying to pull a fast one on the eve of Republic Day. We have sent the object to FSL for further inspection,” an officer added.
