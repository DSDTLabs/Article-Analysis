Hyderabad: In a significant development, Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) Group on Friday announced that it is exiting GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL) by selling its entire 11% stake to GMR Airports Ltd (GAL) for a consideration of $76.05 million (around Rs 487.64 crore or RM295.34 million).

 The exercise is expected to be completed by April 30, 2018, subject to an extension of up to December 1, 2018, the Malaysian airport developer said in a regulatory filing to the Malaysian bourses.
 
 GMR Infrastructure Limited too informed the Indian bourses about its subsidiary GAL entering into an agreement on February 2, 2018, subject to standard approvals, to acquire 4,15,80,000 shares of face value of Rs 10 each, representing 11% equity stake in GHIAL collectively from MAHB and MAMPL.
 
 While MAHB holds 6,460 shares (0.1%) stake in GHIAL, its subsidiary MAMPL holds 41,573,540 shares (10.9% stake) in the Hyderabad airport operator.
 
 On completion of the transaction, which is subject to approvals from the boards and shareholders of the two companies as well as the concerned regulatory authorities, GMR group’s stake in GHIAL will go up from 63% to 74%. The other stakeholders in GHIAL include Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Telangana government with 13% stake each. While GMR group did not divulge any details of the deal, MAHB informed Bursa Malaysia that the sale consideration was arrived at on a “willing-buyer willing-seller” basis after taking into consideration GHIAL’s audited consolidated profit attributable to equity shareholders for the financial year ended March 31, 2017, of Rs 2834.2 million and net assets as at March 31, 2017, of Rs 3026.2 million. 
 
 The fair market valuation report prepared by an independent professional business valuer in 2017 and the future prospect of GHIAL in the concession-based airport operation and development business was also taken into consideration, MAHB added. According to the Malaysian airport developer, the proposed disposal of stake is part of its “portfolio rebalancing strategy” and is an attempt to “unlock its investment in GHIAL at an attractive value”. The proceeds of the stake sale will be used for general corporate purposes and expenses in relation to the proposed disposal, it added. MAHB also said the gain from the proposed disposal is estimated to be RM255.14 million based on the total cost of investment (RM40.2 million) made in GHIAL in 2002.
 
 Interestingly, MAHB’s decision to exit GHIAL, which clocked passsenger traffic of 15.29 million and posted a net profit of over Rs 434 crore on revenues of Rs 1105 crore in FY17, comes after it raised $350 million through an overseas bond offering in October 2017. Last year there was also market buzz about the debt-strapped GMR group being in parleyswith Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to offload around 20-25% stake in the Hyderabad airport project.
 
 GHIAL was set up in 2002 to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad in Hyderabad and the airport commenced commercial operations from March 23, 2008. The Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) project is based on the PPP model.
