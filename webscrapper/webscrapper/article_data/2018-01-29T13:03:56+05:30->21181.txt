 “The housing board area is densely populated. We will revoke the permission issued earlier as the residents don’t want the plant in their vicinity,” the sarpanch said.
 
 Meanwhile, PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar has termed the opposition to the proposed Undir sewage treatment plant as “political”. 
 
 On Saturday, Dhavalikar had alleged that some of his political opponents had instigated local youths to oppose the work of the proposed sewage treatment plant at Undir in Bandora village of Ponda taluka. 
 
 About three hours after his statement, a large group of Curti-Ponda villagers halted the road-digging work for laying pipelines for the plant in Curti. He said that a group of opponents had provoked some village youth to agitate against the plant, despite all clearances being granted. The group had even approached the high court to stop the plant, but the court rejected their plea recently, Dhavalikar said. 
 
 On January 18, over hundred villagers had sent back excavation machinery that had arrived for earth drilling at Undir to lay pipelines for the proposed STP.
 
 The Sewage Infrastructure Development Corporation has proposed a 15-MLD sewage treatment plant at Undir. However, locals are opposing the unit in their village.
