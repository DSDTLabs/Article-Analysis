MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras   has directed the principal secretary, department for the welfare of differently-abled persons to consider a plea seeking to earmark or reserve certain percentage in allotment of Aavin retail milk vending booth in the state to differently-abled people.

 
 One M   filed a case. When it came up for hearing before the division bench of justices   and A M  , the petitionerâ€™s counsel narrated the difficulties faced by the differently-abled people in leading their daily lives. 
 
 Giving preference in allotting Aavin retail milk vending booth will help differently-abled people to some extent, for which the petitioner gave a representation to the department on March 9 this year. 
 
 But, there was no action on its part. Hence, it was necessary to direct the department to consider the plea with immediate effect and without any delay.
 
 Following it, the court said the petitioner sought a direction for a larger relief and however, he limited his prayer to one, seeking consideration of representation. 
 
 Thus, the respondents (including the principal secretary) should consider the representation solely on merits and pass orders in accordance with law.
