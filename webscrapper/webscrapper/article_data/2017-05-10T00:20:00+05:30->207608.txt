Mangaluru: Usman Karopady, father of Abdul Jaleel Karopady who was murdered inside the gram panchayat office at Karopady on April 20, has urged chief minsiter Siddaramaiah to order a CID probe into his son’s killing. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Usman , member of Bantwal taluk panchayat and a local Congress leader, alleged that underworld operative Vikki Shetty alias Balakrishna Shetty is behind the murder of Jaleel.  Usman said he received calls from the underworld don asking him to consider the latter’s relative Dinesh Shetty’s name for the post of vice president of Karopady gram panchayat. Usman also alleged that the murder has links to Dinesh Shetty, who is also a member of Karopady gram panchayat elected from ward number 6 – Odiyoor.  “There were 15 calls to my cellphone from different numbers from abroad on June 29, 2015, between 8.54am and 2.25pm. I did not receive 12 and the last three calls I received were from Vikki Shetty. He insisted that Dinesh Shetty be made the vice-president of of Karopady GP,” Usman added. “Even 20 days after the murder, the police have failed to arrest the main accused Dinesh Shetty, who is roaming around freely in the village. The role of Vikki Shetty will become clear if Dinesh Shetty is arrested. A CID probe needs to be ordered to bring all the people behind my son’s murder to book,” Usman said adding that he will soon meet Siddaramaiah in this regard. Police have already arrested 11 persons in connection with Jaleel’s murder. Motorbike borne assailants had hacked Jaleel to death inside the GP building at around 11.35am on April 20.  Home minister G Parameshwara visited Jaleel’s house during his visit to Mangaluru on May 2. District minister B Ramanath Rai had claimed that the murder was the handiwork of Sangh Parivar activists, an issue that Parameshwara was silent about.
