ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s government has in principle decided to appoint high commissioner to India   as the country’s new foreign secretary, The News reported on Saturday.

 Basit will replace Aijaz Ahmed Chaudhry, who has been appointed as country’s envoy to the US. The decision, according to The News report, was taken after consultations headed by PM Nawaz  . Basit’s name is likely to be announced next week.
 
 Several top diplomats including former ambassador to France Ghalib Iqbal, high commissioner to India Abdul Basit, permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Tehmina Janjua, and high commissioner to the UK Syed Ibni-Abbas were in the running for the top bureaucratic post in foreign affairs.
 
 Basit was the senior most among the contenders. Sources said he was Sharif ’s first choice for the job in 2013 when he was asked to return from Berlin. With the change of the foreign secretary, major reshuffle is likely to take place among Pakistan’s envoys.
 
 Changes will take place within the foreign office as well after the new foreign secretary takes over, sources said.
