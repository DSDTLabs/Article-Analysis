 They were demanding time-bound promotions as well as elevation of their posts so that they can be appointed as social welfare officers.
 
 N D Saraf, a government hostel superintendent at Georai in Beed said the 379 hostels across the state cater to as many as 4 lakh students from the backward castes. “We have been making representations to authorities demanding time-bound promotions after every 12 years of service. We demand that the state give us a promotion to the post of Class-II social welfare officer,” he said. 
 
 He added that following an earlier representation, authorities had promised us to consider promotion within one month to those who completed 12 and 24 years of service. However, the proposal has been pending for months, prompting hostel superintendents to stage the token strike.

 The officials also demanded financial powers, as they have to undergo a tedious process for daily expenditure like communication, electricity, LPG for hostellers, rent, stationery for students, excursion tours and other such petty expenses. On many occasions, hotel superintendents have to bear these expenses.
 
 He said the agitation was being organised in front of the divisional officer of the social welfare department to draw attention of the authorities toward the long-pending demands. 
 
 He also said that hostel superintendents have to work under constant pressure and since they had to stay at the headquarters round the clock, they could not pay attention to their families and so they should be provided appropriate facilities so that they can attend to their domestic issues as well.
