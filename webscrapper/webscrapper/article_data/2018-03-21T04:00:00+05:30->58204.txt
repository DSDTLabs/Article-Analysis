Rajkot: A male leopard, which had created a scare among vilagers of coastal Chanch village in Amreli district, was caged after much efforts by the forest department on Tuesday.

 The Chanch gram panchayat had dashed off a letter to the forest department recently as the leopard was camping there for the last three weeks.
 
 The leopard was spotted sitting on top of an ancient bungalow in Chanch village. Later, forest department team got to know that it was hiding in a ship docked in the premises of the state-run shipbuilding company Alcock Ashdown. 
 
 Though the leopard was caged, locals say that there are four to five leopards in the vicinity and they are constantly living under the fear. Rajula range forest officer (RFO) Rajal Pathak said, “We will set traps to catch other leopard hiding in this area too.” tnn
