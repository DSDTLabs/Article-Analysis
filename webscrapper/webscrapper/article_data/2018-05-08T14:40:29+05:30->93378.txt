VADODARA:   in   witnessed some anxious moments on Monday when a group of around 60 parents reached there to complain against two circulars that the school had issued regarding fee collection.

 Parents, who staged protests at the premises, alleged that the school has issued two circulars regarding the difference in the amount of fees that parents of wards enrolled in pre-primary section are supposed to pay. The parents said that the school had already issued one missive whereby they were asked to submit Rs 2,080 as the difference in fees.
 
 Even as a majority of parents had paid this amount, two days back, they received another circular stating that they need to pay Rs 4,200 more as difference fees. While the parents had reached the school premises, the officials were not available to address their concerns due to ongoing vacation period.
 
 Sources said that the school management later sent a teacher representative to talk to the agitated parents. Later, the teacher collected the queries raised by parents in writing and assured them that the management will address all their concerns.
