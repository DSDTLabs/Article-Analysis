LUCKNOW: A day after TOI highlighted the state goverment’s decision to bring in an ordinance to regulate  , a survey by a citizen engagement platform shows that 65%   in UP say their kids’ schools have hiked the fees by more than 10% for academic session 2016-17. Another 15% said the increase was above 20%.

 The survey by LocalCircles, which was done recently, had 1,129 respondents from five UP cities — Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Lucknow and Kanpur. The team asked the citizens by what percentage has their child’s or grandchild’s school increased the fees for 2016-17. Only 35% of the respondents said the fee was below 10%, while 50% said schools hiked the fee between 11-20%. 
 
 According to Yatish Rajawat, chief strategy officer at LocalCircles, schools continue to charge excessive fee despite the fee disclosure requirement sought by CBSE. Parents have been complaining about the hefty increase in the annual fee charges which schools are unable to justify. 
 
 The government’s decision to bring an ordinance to regulate fees in   has been welcomed by parents who otherwise remain mum on the fee   issue. “We really look forward to the fee regulation rules fixed by the government. The biggest problem with schools is that they charge a huge fee in the name of development, laboratory and under other heads,” said Ameesha Sharma, a parent.
