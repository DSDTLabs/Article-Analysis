LUDHIANA: Coming in support of archbishop of Delhi, various   on Thursday said they accepted his statement and would abide by his directions.

 Giving details,   president Albert Dua said various Christian organizations met in Ludhiana on Thursday, and supported the archbishop. They said they would abide by his directions, adding that whenever a new work was started, they held prayers, and since elections often resulted in a new party coming to power, offering prayers for a better government was no sin. “If wanting a better government that will bring peace and prosperity in the country is a sin, we will commit the same sin again and again. We are for an inclusive and developed India. Instead of one fast on Friday, as advised by the archbishop, we should have one more fast for the country,” said Dua.
 
 He added that the way politicians in power, including the home minister and some other ministers, reacted to the archbishop’s statement indicated there was some shortcoming in the government. Dua added they would pray for a government that brought in more positivity, loved the poor, and worked for peace and communal harmony in the country, instead of creating divisions.
 
 Ashish Lawrence — youth president of   — and Reverend George C Masih from Faridabad asserted that Christians should sincerely think and pray for a better government next year that ensured peace in the country. Pastor K Koshi, representative of Indian Pentecostal Churches in Northern India, supported the archbishop’s letter.
