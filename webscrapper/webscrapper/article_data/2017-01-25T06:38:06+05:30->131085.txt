AMRITSAR: As poll campaigning gains momentum and candidates target their opponents, the contestants of   byelection were seen shaking hands, embracing each other, and even having a conversation over coffee at Rambagh Gardens on Tuesday. 

  candidate Rajinder   Chhina,   Aujla of the Congress, and   (APP) nominee Gurinder Singh Bajwa came face to face at the popular walking spot of Amritsar when they had gone there to campaign in the morning.
 
 Instead of turning their backs on each other, the political foes shook hands, embraced each other and decided to share a table for coffee and talk in the presence of their respective party workers.
 
 During the conversation, the trio avoided politics as a topic to avoid any unsavory situation and, instead, chatted about the cold weather, benefits of walking in the morning, and rising pollution. To the amusement of morning walkers, they clicked selfies together and shared pleasantries before going back to their campaigns to slam each other on the public platform. "These days, a lot of politicians are coming to Rambagh Gardens, as they get a chance to meet a large number of people from different constituencies here. It is strange that three political opponents came face to face, but shared coffee," said morning walker Navtej Singh, while talking to TOI.
 
 Another morning walker, Rakesh Gupta, said he attended a political rally of APP's Bajwa just a day ago and saw him spewing venom against the Congress and BJP. "But here they were talking as if they were the best of friends. This is politics. But they didn't turn away from each other publicly. That's good," he said.
