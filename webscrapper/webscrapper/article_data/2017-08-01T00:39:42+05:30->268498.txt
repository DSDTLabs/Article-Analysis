MUMBAI: A gas leak at a   in   on Monday triggered panic, with   (MGL) expediting plugging of the leak. Power cuts followed at   and there was a huge traffic jam along the Sion-Trombay Road.

 An MGL spokesperson said the leakage occurred during maintenance work in a steel valve at the CNG station. “As soon as we detected the leak, we took precautionary measures. Our emergency team reached the spot and as a precaution, gas supply to five CNG stations in the vicinity and Deonar bus depot was temporarily stopped,” he said.
 
 The emergency team stopped the leakage and work was on to restore gas supply at the earliest, the official said.
 
 Motorists going from Vashi towards Mumbai were affected as traffic cops closed a stretch from Trombay to Sion at Chembur Naka for 15 minutes to allow the fire brigade to control the situation. Additional traffic police personnel were deployed to guide motorists. 
 
 Several private cars, autos, taxis and buses plying on CNG were affected as five CNG pumps were shut in Chembur and Deonar. Many rushed to pumps in Ghatkopar and Sion, resulting in long queues there. MGL officials said the situation would return to normal “at the earliest” and pumps will resume operations.
 
 Ravi Shinde of the Petrol Dealers’ Association said, “The incident has nothing to do with the pump operator/CNG dealer as the exact spot is a little away from the pump at T-junction, which connects to the PNG (piped natural gas) line.” He said the area was cordoned off and CNG pumps in the vicinity were shut temporarily as a “precautionary measure”.
 
 “CNG is a lighter fuel and therefore there was no health problem to any citizen in the area or walking past the pump station,” he added.
