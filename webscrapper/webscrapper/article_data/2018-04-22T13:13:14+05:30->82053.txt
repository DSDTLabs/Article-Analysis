IMPHAL: A day after chief minister   said his government would come up with a bill seeking death penalty for perpetrators of crimes against women, an   court convicted a boarding house owner and teacher of raping and impregnating a minor in 2015. 

 The special judge, Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (Pocso), Imphal West, convicted 37-year-old S Ranbir Meitei from   here under Section 6 of the Pocsco Act, 2012. The court has announced the sentence hearing will be on Tuesday.
 
 In July 2015, the victim's mother had lodged a complaint with police stating that her daughter, then 12 years old, had been raped by the owner of the boarding she was putting up at, the case dossier states. Following that, police arrested Ranbir and his mother when they were taking the minor - three months pregnant - to a clinic for an abortion.
 
 Having framed charges against the Ranbir and his mother, the court tried them under Sections 6 and 17 of the Pocso Act. His mother was eventually discharged. During the trial, 13 prosecution witnesses gave their testimonies while no defence witnesses appeared.
