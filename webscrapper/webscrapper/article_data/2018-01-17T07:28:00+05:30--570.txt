CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Tuesday restrained the   (HSSC) from declaring the result regarding selection of trained graduate teachers (TGTs). A division bench comprising Justices   and B S Walia passed these orders while hearing an appeal filed by   district and several others.

 The appellants submitted that 694 posts of English TGTs were advertised by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission on July 23, 2015. One of the qualifications mentioned was BA with at least 50% marks in English as an elective subject. The government rules applicable for the post also have similar rules. The appellants have passed their BA exam with English as compulsory subject. As they did not have the qualification strictly in terms of the advertisement issued, they never applied for the post. A written test for the post was held on February 7, 2016, and the result was declared on September 3, 2016. Even the interviews had already been held. 
 
 According to the appellants, after the examination and interview a clarification was given by the director, secondary education, Haryana, to the HSSC that the commission can consider compulsory English as equivalent to optional English in case the university gives certificate to this effect. The appellants have argued that the aforesaid clarification was never made public and in any case was sought after the result for the written test had already been declared. The appellants were deprived of their right to get considered as they never got to submit the applications, argued the counsel for the appellants.
 
 Hearing this, the HC stayed the declaration of the final result and asked the state government as well as the HSSC to file reply on the issue by January 23.
