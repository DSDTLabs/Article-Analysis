NEW DELHI: Two sisters — both software engineers — displayed exemplary courage by chasing down a man who snatched their mobile phone and handing him over to the cops. The sisters were shopping in   for the elder sister’s wedding. Despite being pushed by the  , the women didn’t let go and raised an alarm to alert other people.

 The victims,   and her younger   Arushi both live outside Delhi for the past few years and had come to Delhi because Trisha is getting married in a few days’ time. “I had gone shopping for clothes with my sister and we had been out since morning. We went to parathe wali gali around 7pm when my sister felt someone is trying to pull her phone from her pocket, and became alert” Trisha said.
 
 Just a few minutes later, Trisha told TOI said she felt someone sliding his hand inside her jacket’s pocket, but before she could react, the man had already gotten hold of her phone. “I tried to hold it back but he snatched it and started running. For a minute I couldn’t register what was happening but my sister started screaming,” she said.
 
 “Both of us started running behind the man in the narrow lanes and kept screaming chor-chor. Others also gathered and started running after him too. After chasing him for a few meters, we managed to catch hold of him and I slapped him twice,” she added.
 
 A cop who was patrolling in the area noticed us and came to our rescue, she added.
 
 Senior   officers appreciated the good work the sisters did in helping them catch hold of the thief. The man was identified as Saleem Beg, who has a few cases of snatching on him in the past as well.
 
 “I am glad that I helped get the man caught. I thought that today he has robbed me, so tomorrow he might do it with someone else too. That kept me going,” she added.
