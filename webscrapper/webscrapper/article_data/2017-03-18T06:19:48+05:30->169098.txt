HYDERABAD: On a mission to  , three bikers --  ,   and Rishab Shankdhar -- members of the group  , made a stop at Hyderabad on Friday. 

 Hyderabad is the second stop on the trio's schedule, which is spread across 15 days, 11 cities and more than 7,000 kilometers. The group reached Hyderabad late on Thursday night from Nagpur, and was on its way to Bangalore by Friday evening.
 
 "The bike rally is aimed at spreading more awareness about the importance of road safety," explained Aditya Singh, avid biker, while adding that the journey was supported by a Lucknow-based NGO, Shubham Soti Foundation.
 
 The cities that will be covered by the bike rally include Bangalore, Palakkad, Rameshwaram, Kanyakumari, Mangalore, Goa, Mumbai and Indore. While cutting through these cities, members of the group are trying to bring about more awareness on road safety norms by handing out pamphlets and leaflets and giving tips to many at roadside shops. The rally is expected to come to a close at Lucknow, on March 30.
 
 "Around 90 per cent of all road accidents in the country occur because people have neglected road safety norms. Upon arriving in the city, I was surprised to see so many people violating the helmet rule in Hyderabad. The scenario is no different in other places in the country, such as Uttar Pradesh, where such violations are rampant," said Mishra, while reiterating the need for more number of word-of-mouth road safety awareness campaigns, much like the one the trio has kicked off, to bring down road accident numbers.
