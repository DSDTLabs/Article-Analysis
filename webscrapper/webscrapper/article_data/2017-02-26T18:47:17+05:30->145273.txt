And so beautiful and soul-bearing and we all got to see another side of you that you don't always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all of us artists adore you. You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. And I love you. I always have. And I always will. I appreciate it. The academy, I love you, my manager, my husband, and my son. You're the only reason I do it. Thank you so much. Thank you very much to everybody.'
