AHMEDABAD:   and playgroups do not come under the purview of   (Fee Regulation) Bill 2017, which was recently passed by the  . Only playgroups and   in schools affiliated with school boards come under the purview of the bill.

 While the bill has proposed a new fee structure for primary, secondary and higher secondary schools, privately held playgroups, some of which levy exorbitant fees in the range of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh have not been brought under its purview.
 
 Since such schools are not registered with the state government, state education department does not have an estimate of total number of such privately held playgroups and pre-schools operating. “While privately held schools are not covered under the new bill, several of them run as franchises. Therefore, they may be affiliated with a given school somewhere and therefore, tend to come under the purview of the Act,” said Sunaina Tomar, education secretary, state education department. “At present, these schools have been exempted from the new fee structure as proposed in the bill. However, if it is brought to our notice that schools are levying unreasonably high fees, we will think of bringing privately held playgroups as well as pre-schools under the purview of the Act,” said state education minister, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama.
