VADODARA: The   (VMC) general board meeting on Monday evening turned out to be a stormy affair with the opposition   targeting the ruling BJP and the administration on several issues.
 
 The opposition raised several uncomfortable issues during the meeting ranging from the inability of the VMC to conduct work on the Ambedkar Memorial that was promised in   in 2015. Mayor   clarified in the meeting that the VMC was committed to the project and work would begin soon.
  
 The opposition also questioned the delay in taking action on   parlours at prominent locations in the city. The civic body had earlier decided to terminate their lease. This was done after the opposition had raised the issue earlier.
