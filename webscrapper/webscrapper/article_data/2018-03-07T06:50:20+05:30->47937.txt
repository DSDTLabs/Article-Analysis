AHMEDABAD: To preserve and promote   crafts of India, Crafts Design Society (CDS) Art Foundation organized a unique fashion show – Walking Hand-in-Hand – in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. 

 Leading Indian designers of international repute, Rajmata Shubhangini Raje Gaekwad of Vadodara and HH Radhika Raje Gaekwad, Asif Shaikh, Darshan Shah and Gunjan Jain, among others worked with textile artisans from across India to create a collection for the third edition of Walking Hand-in-Hand.
 
 The fashion show showcased a line of garments co-created by leading fashion designers and textile artisans and weavers. The co-created garments, made of handcrafted heritage Indian textiles, including kantha embroidery from West Bengal, block prints, weaves from Odisha and Varanasi, temple flower-dyed fabrics, ikat from Telangana, Kutchhi embroidery and Chanderi weaves, among others, were showcased.
 
 Asif Shaikh, founder,  , said, “Even though Indian textile crafts are invariably part of any given collection, fashion designers are the only ones to get credit for a successful show. We are trying to change this by bringing artisans on the same platform and introducing them to the public. After each collection is presented, the fashion designer and artisans walk the ramp together.”
 
 Shaikh also said that when we lose a craft, we lose a culture. Echoing a similar view, Gauri Wagenaar, who is also part of CDS Art Foundation, said, “There are artisans and craftsmen who have given up the craft that their families practised and preserved for generations. CDS Art Foundation aims to revive and reinvigorate textile heritage. Heritage Indian crafts can be as inspiring and sought after as any global brand.”
 
 After earlier shows of Walking Hand-in-Hand, eight artisans have been promoted by the foundation internationally and they have conducted talks and workshops.
