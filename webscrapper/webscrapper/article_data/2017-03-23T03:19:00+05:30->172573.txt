Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, on Wednesday, assured of obtaining complete information from the investigating officer (IO) in the Irish woman murder case to ascertain if the investigation is on the right track. Speculations have been rife about more than one persons involvement in the murder. Additionally, a NGO, Goenkar pointing to a few loose ends in the case raised doubts as to whether the investigation was on course, though the Canacona police nabbed the accused Vikat Bhagat, 24, a history sheeter on charges of rape, murder and destruction of evidence within a few hours of the crime. “The police will get a call asking for information in ten minutes. I will check with them,” Parrikar told reporters after the same was pointed out to him. The CM also noted that the police acted swiftly in arresting the accused.  Parrikar asserted that his government would adopt a “zero tolerance approach towards crime against women” and added that he would seek more details about the murder to ensure that the case is probed properly. The naked body of Irish national Danielle McLaughlin, 28, was found at an isolated spot at Devbagh, Canacona last week. The autopsy established that McLaughlin was strangulated to death and sexually assaulted. Canacona locals, who submitted a memorandum to South Goa SP citing Bhagat’s excesses – 14 pending cases, including nine cases of theft and one of dacoity – had demanded that he be externed from the area.  McLaughlin’s body, kept at GMC, Bambolim, was handed over to the undertaker.
