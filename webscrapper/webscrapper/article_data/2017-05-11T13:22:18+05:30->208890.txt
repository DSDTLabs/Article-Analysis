 who turned producer with a number of regional films ranging from Bhojpuri and Marathi to Sikkimese, Goan and Bengali, is now planning to venture into Hindi film production. 
 
  
  
 The 34-year-old-actress wants to co-produce a Hindi drama with her 'Mary Kom' producers and the studio that is releasing her Hollywood debut, 'Baywatch', in India. Ask her if this is business move and PeeCee retorts, “I think with my heart and not my head. I am instinctive but not impulsive. And money is not the end goal. If it was, I wouldn't be producing regional films whose reach is limited. It's so much easier to make money as a Hindi film producer. But we are still a small company and new as producers. We still have a lot to learn."
 
 Besides co-producing the film, does PeeCee plan to contribute to the script? “I'm not that talented. I love writing. I've worked with the most talented writers in the world ­ in Hindi cinema and on  . I don't have enough knowledge yet, but I am overlooking the screenwriting process," she says. And what about penning her autobiography? "If I could clone myself I would do a lot more. I'm chasing time!" she chuckles.
