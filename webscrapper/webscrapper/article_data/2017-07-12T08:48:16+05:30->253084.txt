HYDERABAD: The issue of sharing river water between Telangana and   has once again reached a flashpoint with both states refusing to compromise on their stand. Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday abstained from the   ( ) meeting. While Telangana is insisting on a fair share in Krishna waters, AP has been insisting on a final verdict from the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal. 

 With neither state ready to listen to the directions issued by the KRMB, the Centre dashed off a letter to both states requesting them to follow the formula applied last year for the distribution of Krishna waters. Union water resources ministry joint secretary, Sanjay Kundu, asked the two states to express their position on this.
 
 “Since the present   agreement worked well in 2016-17 and KWDT-II award has not been finalised, it is suggested that the same agreement be continued for the water year of 2017-18,” the joint secretary said in his letter to irrigation secretaries of two states.
 
 Reminding them the apex council meeting on Sept 21, 2016, in which the chief ministers of the two states participated, the Centre said the 37:63 ratio for Telangana and AP had worked well. As per this, Telanagana would get 299 TMC ft and AP will ge 512 TMC ft water.
 
 Raising objection to this, Telangana has demanded a share in the water diverted by AP through Pattiseema project. As per the the Bachawat Tribunal award, AP has to share the water diverted from   river with Maharashtra and Karnataka. Now, Telangana, being the upper riparian state, is demanding a share of 45 TMC feet out of the total 80 TMC feet diverted.
 
 AP, on the other hand, feels water allocation is the job of the Brijesh Tribunal. It argues that water sharing would only happen after the completion of Polavaram project.
