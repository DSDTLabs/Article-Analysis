HYDERABAD: The Union water resources ministry has asked Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to attend a meeting in Delhi on Friday. 

 The aim of the meet is to decide scope of the Krishna and Godavari water boards. The move comes at a time when Telangana is insisting the scope of the water boards not be decided until project-wise allocations are made. 
 
 Indications are that under pressure from AP, the Centre wants to hand over the responsibility of water management to the Krishna and  . Friday's meeting has been called ahead of the scheduled meeting of officials of the two states and the Union water resources ministry on February 15, which was to resolve pending issues related to water.
 
 Friday's meeting could also be related to the appointment of   as Union water resources secretary in place of Amarjith Singh. During Amarjith Singh's term, the Centre had proposed that the installation of telemetry systems be completed and year-wise allocations made for the two states. This was opposed by AP which wanted the scope of KRMB and GRMB to be decided first. After   retired, Upendra Singh took over and called for a meeting on February 15 to discuss pending issues with the two states. 
 
 "The sudden decision must be the result of AP government's pressure on   government in the budget session. We will not allow the Centre to hand over the reservoirs to the boards until there is clarity over allocations for each project located in Telangana," said a senior irrigation department official.
