KOLKATA: The Mahatma Gandhi Road   station got an uplift on Tuesday with Metro Railway, jointly with the Metro Railway Women’s Welfare Organisation (MRWWO), setting up a permanent display named ‘Bapu’s Legacy’. The items on display include paintings by well known artists on Mahatma Gandhi’s life and his role in the freedom struggle. A hand-crafted wooden charkha or spinning wheel has also been placed on display inside a glass showcase.

 Several artists and sculptors, who were invited to the venue, sketched, painted and sculpted on the theme within the station premises even as passengers watched. Live bhajans were also performed during the session. 
 
 “We started this drive to turn our stations more attractive at Park Street on December 29. The Durga idol from Ahiritola Sarbojanin Durga Puja Samity has been put up on permanent display at Park Street station. While well-known painter Wasim Kapoor sketched, Pandit Mallar Ghosh performed during the occasion. Painter Debasis Mallick Chowdhury was also present. Paintings and sculptures by 55 eminent artists were put up on display at Park Street till January 2,” said Indrani Banerjee, CPRO, Metro Railway. 
 
 MRWWO president Amita Chauhan has taken the initiative to brighten up station premises through theme-based exhibitions. “We have plans to take up such work at stations that have heritage value,” she said. 
 
 According to an official, Esplanade is among the stations where such a gallery has been planned. The Esplanade station has a lot of space where exhibits can be displayed, he said. It is also centrally located and a lot of people pass through. Many of them are not even Metro commuters but use the subways to cross the busy streets. However, the idea is to wait for engineering department staff to start some repair or renovation work at a station before going in for installation of a gallery. “This saves on expenditure and effort. When renovation is on, we can guide the employees accordingly,” he added.
