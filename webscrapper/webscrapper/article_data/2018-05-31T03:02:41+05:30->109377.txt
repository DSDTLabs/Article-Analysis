NEW DELHI: Delhi   on Wednesday sought an explanation from Delhi government on its failure to penalise private unaided schools, which have not given   of   fee charged by them several years ago.

 These schools had taken excess fee from parents citing financial burden imposed due to implementation of 6th Pay Commission. Later, a high court-appointed panel recommended refund of the excess fee.
 
 A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Vinod Goel issued notice to the Delhi government on a plea seeking directions to the government to attach bank accounts of errant schools, and sought its response by July 23.
 
 HC lamented that despite an order passed by it seven years ago for refund of excess fee to parents, many were still waiting. It said the schools had collected the money years ago but no benefit was rendered to the parents as they had not even received back the principal amount paid by them to the schools.
 
 “Directorate of Education shall file a detailed affidavit elaborating the steps that it has taken and proposes to undertake in the averments made in the case in six weeks,” the court noted.
