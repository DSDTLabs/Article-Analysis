MUMBAI: Even as Dinesh Sangale’s family is devastated after losing its sole breadwinner to a tree fall, the BMC and the owner of the premises where the gulmohar tree stood are busy passing the buck. For months, the tree, just inside the boundary wall of Mumbai Marathi   ( ),  , had a dangerous tilt and it was evident it needed to be worked on.

 MMGS claims it wrote to the BMC about the matter last August, but nothing was done. The letter, a copy of which was shown to   on Friday, a day after the death of Naigaum resident Sangale (38), reads: “The tree has fully bent towards the road and therefore it can fall anytime.” Attached with the letter was a picture of the tilted tree.
 
 The BMC, on the other hand, says it served a notice earlier this month to MMGS, ordering it to trim trees on its premises. “During a general inspection of the tree, it was noticed that some trees on the premises of MMGS were overgrown and had tilted towards the roadside. They may fall any time, thereby causing damage to life and property,” the BMC’s notice reads.
