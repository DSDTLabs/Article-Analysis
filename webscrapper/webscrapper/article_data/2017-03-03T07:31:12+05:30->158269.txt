MUMBAI: BJP leader   on Thursday batted for a   for the Mumbai mayoral elections. Gadkari told TOI that since there was no clear mandate for the BJP or Sena, “in the larger interest of both parties, they should join hands for the mayoral election.“ He added, “If Sena does not come forward, all options are open for BJP.“ Gadkari said there were no ideological differences between Sena and BJP. “Now that the election process is over, both parties must forget the past and join hands for the cause of the people,“ he said.

 A senior BJP cabinet member told TOI that the BJP is to decide whether to contest the mayoral poll. While Sena spokesperson Anil Parab did not respond to TOI's message,   chief   said Congress will contest the poll, and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said a strategy for the mayoral election will be drafted on Sunday when leaders of opposition meet on the eve of the legislature's budget session.
 
 Nirupam alleged that “BJP is making all possible efforts to engineer a split in the Congress. Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil called up a few Congress councillors for support to BJP. Three senior BJP leaders approached our members. Our councillors are firm, they have declined the offer.“
 
 However, CM   said no cabinet minister of the BJP had got in touch with Congress councillers and the BJP did not need Congress support. Chandrakant Patil did not respond to Nirupam's charges.
