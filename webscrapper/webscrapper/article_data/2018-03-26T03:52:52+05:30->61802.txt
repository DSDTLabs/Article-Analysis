MUMBAI: The state government has written to the  , directing it to probe 2,001 civic employees and officers who have been accused of corruption in various cases. 

 An official from the urban development department said investigations were pending against these 2,001 employees from 261 departments. He said BMC corporators had written to the state, complaining that files of around 1,000 officials had been intentionally misplaced, so that investigation against them could not be completed.
 
 "However, when asked for an explanation, the BMC said none of the files were misplaced," he added.
 
 "The corporators demanded that the state take cognisance of the delay in investigations and ask the BMC to finish them at the earliest," the official said. On receiving the complaint, the state government on March 8 directed the BMC to complete the pending inquiries at the earliest. 
 
 Unsatisfied with the government's directive, the opposition   claimed it was unlikely that the inquiry would bear any result. "The entire country knows that the BMC is a centre of corruption which thrives on the nexus between the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena and corporation officials. This nexus cannot be broken till these parties are thrown out of power,"   spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. He added it would not be surprising if the BMC, in future, changes its stand and says the files pertaining to the investigation against its officials have been misplaced. agencies
