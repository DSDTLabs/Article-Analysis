BAREILLY: The city   department along with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) will launch a special drive against   plying in the city from Monday. Also, actions will be taken against tempos with rural permit operating in the city.
 
  Unregistered   caught during the drive would be dismantled immediately so that the vehicles could not return to the roads.
  
  Superintendent of police (traffic) Kamlesh Bahadur told TOI, “If an e-rickshaw is found plying on the city roads unregistered, the vehicle will be impounded and dismantled immediately on the spot to ensure that the seized vehicle does not return to roads, and such violations are not continued in the future.”
  
  Traffic department officials said despite several surprise crackdowns and warnings to the auto drivers, operation of vehicles without permit and rural permit continued unabated in the city, thus, a special crackdown on unregistered e-rickshaws was planned.
  
  SP said, “The main aim behind launching the drive is to check the rampant violation of the Central Motor Vehicles Act. Besides, we want to send a strong message that any kind of violations will not be tolerated.”
  
  According to traffic department, city’s public transport system comprises nearly 2,200 Vikram tempos (big three-wheelers), around 3,000 e-rickshaws, 3,250 small auto-rickshaws and 14 radio taxis.
  
  Assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) (administration) RP Singh told TOI, “In the past, several awareness drives were organised to educate drivers and make them aware about the consequences of violating traffic norms. But, it has been observed that they continued unabated.”
  
  “Public transports, including tempos and e-rickshaws, will be stopped and checked at all prominent city junctions. If found ferrying commuters in the city, tempos with rural permit will be impounded, while unregistered e-rickshaws will be dismantled by the enforcement team,” said ARTO.
