CHENNAI: Tipplers in the state can rejoice. Popular brands like   beer and McDowell’s brandy will be back on the shelves at   outlets as the state owned liquor monopoly has released supply orders to Enrica Enterprises, the first since September last year.

 Enrica makes popular   brands like McDowell’s, Signature and Royal Challenge on a royalty basis for Diageo-controlled  , while Chennai Breweries & Empee Breweries, which are owned by  , brew Kingfisher   for supply in Tamil Nadu. The first despatches are said to have happened on Tuesday.
 
 The state-owned corporation had stopped purchase of IMFL or hard liquor from Enrica and beer from United Breweries since September 3, 2016. While sources said there was a tax dispute, a section of the trade blamed red tape and nepotism for the situation. These brands were among the favourites for tipplers in the state and their sudden non-availability raised many questions.
 
 Last month, the employees of Enrica Enterprises staged protests outside the residence of former chief minister O Paneerselvam. They also filed a writ petition against Tasmac in the Madras high court, stating that the arbitrariness of the state government had resulted in no salaries for them since last October.
 
 Tamil Nadu is a crucial market for liquor companies with monthly alcohol sales recording 45 lakh cases annually, a figure that is growing by more than 8% by volume every year. It is the single largest market for Indian-made Foreign Liquor in the country. The monthly beer sales range between 20 lakh and 30 lakh cases, and are expected to peak in the summer months.
