PUNE: With just a fortnight left to register ongoing projects under the   (RERA),   authorities are cranking up the heat.

 Real estate developers peg the number of ongoing constructions at 3,000-5,000, but RERA authorities say the actual number is higher than 10,000.
 
 On Saturday, RERA officials told TOI that 596 developers and 3,500 agents had registered with them. Around 300 projects were cleared, and authorities said they will take action against   projects after the deadline. 
 
 Authorities have reached out to chief town planners for the rural areas and the urban development department through the local bodies. “If a construction has permission but has yet to be completed, it will come under our purview. Once we have the final list, it will be easier to take action. It is up to the local body to take action against those constructions for which permission was not sought, and are illegal,” said MahaRERA secretary Vasant Prabhu told TOI.
 
 Letters were sent to local bodies for details of such buildings. Officials said that they will soon chart out an action plan. 
 
 Developers for their part told TOI that there were hiccups regarding the paperwork for registration. “It is unlikely that a builder will not register as the penalty is 10% of the project cost, which would cause huge losses. They will not risk it,” Maharashtra Credai president   said.
 
 RERA authorities further said they are anticipating a last-minute rush. “We are prepared. Technical assistance has been readied and there will be no issues from our side,” an official said.
