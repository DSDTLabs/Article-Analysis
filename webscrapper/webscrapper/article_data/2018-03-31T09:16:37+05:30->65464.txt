AHMEDABAD: A 30-year-old resident of New CG Road has filed a complaint against his wife’s alleged   for intimidation with Chandkheda police.

 Investigators said Chintan (last name withheld to protect identity), a resident of New CG Road, has a studio in the Shahibaug area of the city. According to his complaint, his 29-year-old wife works for a major retail brand as a sales executive. Bharat Vala, a resident of Ghatlodia, works at the same store as cashier-cum-manager.
 
 “Chintan suspected Vala was having an affair with his wife. A while ago, he had started transferring call recordings from his wife’s phone into his. By this, he established that there was a relationship between the two and also caught them red-handed during a rendezvous on February 25,” said an investigator.
 
 Soon after that, Chintan started getting threatening calls from Vala. According to the complaint, on March 4, Vala allegedly followed him and later threatened him with dire consequences later, speaking on his wife’s phone. After consulting his family, Chintan decided to approach police for help. Investigators said they are yet to record statements of the accused in the case.
