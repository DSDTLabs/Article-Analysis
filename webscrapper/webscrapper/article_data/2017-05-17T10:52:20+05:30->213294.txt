ZIRAKPUR: The town which has grown over the years with more than 60 housing societies and a number of highrises, including multiplexes, shopping malls and marriage palaces, is struggling to get its own fire station.

 Despite various proposals made by the local municipal council, residents continue to rely on Derabassi, Chandigarh, Panchkula and   fire stations. A fire tender from the nearest fire station in   also takes more than 15-20 minutes to reach a site anywhere in Zirakpur.The time taken, residents say , is too long as on many occasions blazes have already left a trail of destruction by the time firefighters arrive. Members of Residents Welfare Association say they have spent their hard-earned money to live here but surprisingly , the authorities are least concerned about the safety of the common man.
 
 “The issue has been raised a number of times in the municipal council since its formation, but to no avail. Various proposals have been made only to fool us,“ says Maninder Pal Singh, a retired   official and a resident of VIP Road.
 
 Rajiv Kulharia, a resident of VIP Road, says, “It seems that the authorities concerned have somehow ignored one of the very basic requirements in Zirakpur, which is considered a gateway to Punjab and is touted as one of the most fast developing towns in Mohali district.“
 
 On the other hand, local MLA N K Sharma says, “A common fire station of Zirakpur and Derabassi is located in Derabassi. We have got funds from the government to purchase two fire tenders with a hydraulic ladder for Zirakpur. We are going to make the purchase soon. Both the fire tenders will specifically work for Zirakpur but will be manned by the Derabassi fire station.“
 
 Population of Zirakpur, as per a census by the SAS Nagar administration in 2010, is 1.5 lakh but in seven years it has crossed the mark of 2 lakh, say officials from the local bodies department.
