BHUBANESWAR: It was a proud moment for the composer, writer and singers of the popular Sambalpuri song   when more than 13,000 people cheered for them at the opening ceremony of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships, here on Wednesday. In a wonderful gesture towards the folk artists, noted singer-composer Shankar Mahadevan called upon Jitendra Haripal, Krishna Patel, music director Prabhudutta Pradhan and lyricist Mitrabhanu Gauntia on stage and sought their permission before he sang the song. 

 "I am really happy that the organiser selected Rangabati song for this mega event. That athletes and officials from more than 40 countries as well as people from Odisha enjoyed the song in Shankar Mahadevan's voice is indeed a great honour," said Haripal, the original singer of the foot-tapping number. Earlier, they had put a condition that the song has to be presented in its original form without any changes. 
 
 "The song is not just limited to Odisha but is famous all over Asia. The foot-tapping number is so mesmerising that it broke the language barriers and people from different countries will enjoy the song here at this mega event," said Mahadevan before belting out the song. Prior to that Mahadevan sought the blessings of the original creators and asked them to forgive him if he makes any mistake in rendering the song. The popular Rangabati song was composed in the 70s and has since then been a rage.
