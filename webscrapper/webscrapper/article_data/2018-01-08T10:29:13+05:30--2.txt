CHANDIGARH: While   has already declared holidays till January 14 and   has changed school timings, keeping in view the dense fog conditions, Chandigarh has not taken any such decision. Parents and teachers have urged the UT education department to either extend holidays or change school timings. Many private and all government schools will be re-opening after winter vacations on Monday. 

 Students from entire Tricity and even from far-off places like   and Kharar travel to schools in Chandigarh. Education secretary BL sharma confirmed that the schools will re-open on Monday. 
 
 UT cadre educational employees union president   said, "We have already written to the education secretary to extend the winter vacation till January 13 following such cold weather. It is really difficult for children to travel early in the morning to school especially, the younger ones. However, the department has not paid any heed to it. Punjab government has already changed school timings and Haryana government has also extended vacations."
 
 Parents feel the need of extending vacations seeing their children travel in the cold in early morning hours. "Education department can at least keep schools closed for primary school children," said  , a parent-cum-member of Chandigarh Parents Association.
 
 Jaspreet kaur, another parent said, "I do not feel the need for administration to extend winter vacations as the weather improves by afternoon but it will really help if they change school timings like Punjab as it is the morning hours that are troublesome."
 
 The timings of the opening of schools have been shifted to 10am in   district.
