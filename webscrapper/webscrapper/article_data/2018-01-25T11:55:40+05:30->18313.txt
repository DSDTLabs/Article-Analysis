ALLAHABAD: Amid rumours of the vice-chancellor of   resigning from his post on Wednesday and the official denying he put in his papers, university teachers met divisional commissioner   late evening. They were demanding strict action against some student leaders for allegedly misbehaving with vice-chancellor Prof RL Hangloo at   (ECC). 

 Hangloo had gone to ECC, a constituent college of AU, on Wednesday to attend a function at the department of education. Soon, a group of student leaders also arrived there and demanded a meeting with the VC.
 
 When they could not meet Hangloo, they allegedly gheraoed him for around two hours. Their demands included ensuring AU teachers gave classes regularly, the university worked for six days and that hostellers weren't charged for ten months as they were provided accommmodation for just around six months. Later, Hangloo said, "I have not resigned. Some individuals, who claim to be students of AU and leaders of  , had come to attack him at the college, but there wasn't much they could do."
