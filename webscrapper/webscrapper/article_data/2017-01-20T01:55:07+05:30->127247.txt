GURGAON: The three members of deceased   Sandeep Gadoli’s gang, who were arrested on Wednesday for the murder of   alias Pappu, brother of Gadoli’s rival Binder Gujjar, claimed that they had planned to murder arch rival   as well as eliminate the cops who had killed Gadoli in Mumbai, but heavy security prevented them from doing so.

 According to a source, the trio, identified as Brahmaprakash alias Master, Gadoli’s brother, Luv Sharma and Jaibir, had hatched a plan to murder Binder Gujjar at his daughter’s wedding on January 15, but their plan was foiled by heavy security cover. They were now looking for another opportunity to take revenge. They also told the police that the Gurgaon cops, who were part of the encounter team that eliminated Gadoli, were also on their hit list.
 
 It may be noted that only one constable from the encounter team is on the run while the other four were arrested by Mumbai police and put behind bars. Binder Gujjar’s younger brother Manoj is also absconding.
 
 “Brahmaprakash, the main accused, revealed that he had hatched the plan to eliminat Manish. He also provided money and weapons to the shooters. Four shooters who were arrested in Rohtak will also be taken in remand,” said Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime), Gurgaon.
 
 Pappu was shot dead shortly before midnight on October 17 in Gurgaon, when he was collecting cash from a wine shop he owned in the city. Eight to ten assailants had opened fire on him, killing him on the spot, sources said.
