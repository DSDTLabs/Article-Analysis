COLVA: In what appears to be a case of utter negligence by electricity department officials, low tension (LT) wires have been conveniently fastened to a coconut tree located along the main road in  .

 Villagers informed TOI that despite informing the junior engineer and linemen attached to the Benaulim substation, no attempts have been made to erect a pole and shift the wires.
 
 When it was noticed that the live LT cables were sagging close to the ground, the linemen tied the wires to the coconut tree as a stopgap measure, some months ago. The tree is situated along the Benaulim–Margao road which is frequented by villagers of the Salcete coastal belt.
 
 According to a Benaulim local, the officials and linemen attached to the sub-station are prompt in replacing electrical poles that are damaged by vehicles, even at times completing the task the very next day. But in this case, the linemen don’t seem keen on erecting a pole and tightening the sagging wires, the villager added.
 
 The wires were last tightened just before the international   summit that was held in October 2016.
 
 When contacted earlier this week, junior engineer N   said that as the matter was brought to his notice, it will be rectified.
