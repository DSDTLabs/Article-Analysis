CHANDIGARH: There would be a cap of 8% on   in private schools as the   administration has notified   Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016. This was told by the UT administration to the Punjab and   high court on Monday. 

 The move came after the UTâ€™s proposal regarding an 8% cap on feee hike to the Centre and the   was approved. 
 
 The decision has come as a shocker for city-based unaided private schools who claimed there were no rules which could regulate fee structure. The HC has disposed of the PIL and observed that schools remain on the forefront while receiving benefit from the government on concessional rates, but if they are asked to implement government policies, they start protesting.
 
 As per the notification, if any private school violates the cap, it would have to face penalty for the deed. In the first attempt, violation fine would be imposed, but if the school violates the guidelines a second time, double fine would be imposed. In a third such attempt, the affiliation of the school would be cancelled.
 
 Previously, a PIL was filed in the high court stating that many schools have been indulging in profiteering and flouting norms and regulations framed by the CBSE. It was alleged that despite the high court directives, the UT administration has not framed any policy to regulate fee structure and the same is causing so inconvenience and harassment to parents every year.
