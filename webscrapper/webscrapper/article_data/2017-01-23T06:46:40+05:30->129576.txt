LUCKNOW: If the Congress-SP alliance has brought smiles on the faces of BJP leaders, it is because of this simple reason-a Muslim polarisation in favour of this combine is far more preferable over a Dalit-Muslim consolidation which BSP leader   has been trying for. If Muslims find this alliance best-placed to defeat the BJP and vote en masse in its favour, saffron leaders hope this would lead to a counter-polarisation among Hindus in their support. 

 Since last year, the BJP had positioned its campaign in such a way that their attack was focussed on the SP and its government. The BJP leaders projected the SP as their main rival and not the BSP. Reason: A stronger SP means Muslim consolidation towards it. That's why when the SP was undergoing an internal feud over the past four months and BSP Mayawati was aggressively wooing Muslims, it gave scare to the BJP think tank.
 
 "Mayawati's Muslim overreach and her bid to convince them that she was their best bet and not a broken SP had many takers in the community. A possibility of Dalit-Muslim consolidation was giving sleepless nights to BJP. The formalisation of this alliance has come as good news for them," says a political analyst.
 
 With the SP and the   joining hands, chances are less now that Muslim would go towards the BSP, a senior BJP leader told TOI. He added that in that case Dalits alone won't help the BSP. Besides, the BJP is already working overtime to woo non-Jatav Dalit voters.
 
 Another worry BJP leaders are not ready to foresee is the fact that with the Congress joining hands with the SP, it would be in a better position to woo upper caste urban electorate which had been a votebank for the BJP in the last elections.
