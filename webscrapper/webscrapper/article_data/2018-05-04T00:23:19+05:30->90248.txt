Trichy: Expressing dissatisfaction over the non-formation of the Cauvery Management Board (CMB), president of the MDMK, Vaiko has termed the order to release 4 tmc of water to Tamil Nadu as eyewash. 

 “The constitution of the Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery water regulation committee will only bring the dams in Karnataka under its control, thus Tamil Nadu can get the due share of water as per the final verdict of tribunal. But the order of the Supreme Court to release 4 tmc water is an eyewash,” Vaiko said in a statement on Thursday’s order. 
 
 “There is no assurance that Karnataka will release water as per the advice of the Supreme Court,” said Vaiko. tnn
