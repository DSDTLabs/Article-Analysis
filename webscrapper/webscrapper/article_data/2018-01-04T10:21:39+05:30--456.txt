LUDHIANA: A city-based   activist has lodged a complaint against the ongoing construction of an illegal building on Dugri Road without getting any approval of the building plan. MC officials have also replied to the activist that there is no record of building plan approval. The activist has now forwarded the complaint against the owner to MC Commissioner   and vigilance department of Punjab police demanding action.

 RTI activist   told he had demanded information under RTI from the MC officials about multi-storey building on Dugri Road. The MC officials in reply to the query have admitted that there was record available with the department about this building and no building plan was approved by MC. Hence, it is being constructed illegally.   said he has now filed a complaint against the owner with MC as well as the vigilance department of police for action. 
 
 He added it has caused huge loss to the MC exchequer as the owner did not deposit the building plan approval charges, change of land use charges and external development charges. He said the revenue loss to MC is in crores because the commercial construction is on at a prime road of the city. Dev also took on the officials for their lackadaisical attitude. 
 
 Assistant town planner   did admit the construction of the building was not in conformity with proper norms and action will be taken against the owner.
