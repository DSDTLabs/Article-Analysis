NEW DELHI: Most people know that Prime Minister   is an active and enthusiastic practitioner of yoga, and that he starts his day with an hour-long session. But today, he skipped that all important morning ritual because he went to meet his mother, 97-year-old Heeraben.

 
 
  
 
 Heeraben lives in   with her younger son Pankaj, who's a senior Gujarat government officer. Last September, Modi visited his mother to take her blessings on his 66th birthday. 
 
 After becoming Prime Minister in May 2014, Modi visited Gandhinagar in September, also on his birthday. At the time, his mother gifted the PM a Bhagavad Gita and Rs 5,001 as per Gujarati tradition. Modi donated that money to the Kashmir flood relief fund.
 
 The PM is known to be extremely close to his mother, which is why he skipped his all-important yoga practice today. Generally, the PM starts his day with a surya namaskar and pranayam and follows that up with a set of other yoga exercises.
 
 In June last year , during the second   celebrations, the PM led a mass yoga demonstration in Chandigarh. He also released a commemorative postal stamp on surya namaskar. 
 
 "I really feel some people don't fully understand the power and benefits of yoga... Yoga is not about what one will get, it is about what one can give up...With zero budget, yoga provides health assurance. Yoga does not discriminate between rich and poor,"the PM said on the occasion.
