Vadodara: Three policemen of Panvad police station at Chhota Udepur were suspended on Tuesday after a team led by assistant superintendent of police Dharmendra Sharma raided a house in Dungra village and seized IMFL worth Rs 9.89 lakh. Superintendent of police M S Bhabhor suspended D M Vasava, police sub-inspector, Ganesh Rathwa, assistant sub-inspector and police constable Virsinh Rathwa for negligence in work. Bhabhor has also ordered enquiry against them. A police official said that they have ruled out any collusion between the three cops and the arrested accused Jangu Harijan and Karim Harijan. “The liquor was seized from their jurisdiction and they did not realize that liquor in such large quantity was being sold therefore I have suspended for their negligence,” said Bhabhor. On January 5, the police had raided the house of Harijan and found 234 boxes of liquor stacked inside a room. Cops had also seized three pick-up vans which the father-son duo had used for transporting the liquor boxes. Some weeks back too, a police constable was suspended after liquor was seized from Jodavant village.
