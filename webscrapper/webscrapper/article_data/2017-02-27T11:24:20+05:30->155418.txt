PANAJI: Terming the status of one of Asia's oldest medical institution as that of a patient on ventilator, the   has accused the state government of neglecting the   and hospital(GMC).

 “It is correct to say that the GMC has moved from the general ward to the ventilator under the BJP government,” party spokesperson   said. He demanded that the   report on the functioning of the institute be made public. 
 
 “The commission was formed seven months ago, but till now, there’s no news of what recommendations were made by them. The government should release the report.”
 
 The party also alleged that the GMC is being plagued with power cuts and an absence of a stable power backup is adversely affecting the daily operations of Goa’s premier health institute.
 
 “Due to absence of a power backup system, patients are not getting their X-RAYS and MRIs done. BJP is more interested in bodies like GSIDC and beach cleaning. They’re not interested in improving GMC,” Kamat said, adding that the party is demanding that a well known dietician be appointed to supervise the food that is being served to patients.
