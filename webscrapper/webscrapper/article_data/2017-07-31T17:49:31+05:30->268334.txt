 While most analysts were aware that Sharad Yadav was unhappy with Nitish's decision, he had maintained a stoic silence thus far, not publicly commenting about it until Monday morning. He has, though, given plenty of indications that he is displeased, by taking to Twitter to lambast his party's new ally, the BJP, for not taking action against back money and against those implicated in the Panama Papers.

 JD(U)'s Rajya Sabha MPs Veerendra Kumar and Ali Anwar have openly criticised Nitish's move to break away from the 'grand alliance'. They also met with Sharad Yadav in Delhi following the break-up of the 'grand alliance'.
