HYDERABAD : Traffic was thrown out of gear in various parts of the city on Monday, after the over four-hour-long rainfall left many streets waterlogged. 

    snarls were seen in Khairatabad,   Market, Nampally, Punjagutta and Abids, where the roads were severely waterlogged. 
 
  Motorists had a tough time negotiating through these roads. Many were stranded in traffic jams for hours together. Infuriated, many commuters were heard lashing out at the authorities for failing to provide a permanent solution to this crisis. "This is the case every monsoon. The same roads are waterlogged. Yet, the authorities don't seem to learn their lesson," said Aditya G, ruing how he struggled to drive through a waterlogged street in Nampally. 
 
  Commuters at Mozam Jahi aired similar grievances and complained about the bad roads and the pits on the stretch near the heritage site. "I have, in the past, damaged my car because of these pits. The government should immediately take up repair work along these stretches," said  , a marketing executive who was forced to parked his car near the market - until the rain subsided - as he was unable to drive through the road. 
 
  Also adversely affected were residents living in   colonies in peripheral areas such as Vanasthalipuram, Hastinapuram, Nandanavam and   The rains led to sewage water overflowing outside their houses. 
 
  "The authorities take up monsoon related works in our area just a month before the rains arrive. Pumping out water and cleaning manholes whenever it rains provides only temporary relief," said Tilak P, a resident of  .
