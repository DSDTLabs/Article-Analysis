 of the city,   with the   is familiar to most Chennaiites.   at the Anna Tower Park stands tall as the reminder of the industrial meet which was a seminal event that brought global attention to Madras and the expanding city woke up to a neighbourhood that offered affordable housing.

 While the tower and park have become recreational spaces for the busy locality, a few hundred metres from the park is a large wall with a mural that reminds of the origins of the locality. Representing more than 30 industries like construction, coal extraction, metal work, power, with a labourer at the centre, the colourful mural served as one of the seven entrances to the trade at the time.
 
 “It is possible that this was the main entrance and chief minister C N Annadurai had inaugurated the event at this entry point.
 
 The parabolic arch in front of the wall is the only one remaining of the seven arches,” says Thirupurasundari Sevvel, a heritage consultant and architect. She has been piecing together information about the locality and raising more awareness about the iconic structures in the area. “In the 60s, this area was called the West Madras Neighbourhood Plan. The C Kandaswami Naidu College for Men across the main road served as the VIP parking lot for the fair in 1968 and a star hotel, where Ampa Skywalk now stands, was used to accommodate state visitors from at least 50 countries,” she says.
 
 Residents have a faint idea about the connection between the park and the mural but many have forgotten the association with the trade fair that was inaugurated on January 21, 1968, which changed the face of this quiet locality.
