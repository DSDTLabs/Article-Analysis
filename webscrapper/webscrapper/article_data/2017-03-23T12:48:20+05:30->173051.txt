THANE: Two persons were arrested from   on Tuesday for smuggling two  . 

 The crime branch acted on a tip off against two ‘snake friends’ who were looking for customers to buy the snakes for a whopping Rs 55 lakh.
 
 Senior inspector Ravindra Doiphode, along with his team, laid a trap and intercepted the duo on the Panchpakhadi service road.
 
 Upon carrying out the search of the sacks the duo possessed, the police found two sand boa snakes weighing 1.50 kg and 2 kg. The reptiles were 39 inches-long, said the police.
 
 The arrested duo -- Sandip Pandit and Ananta Ghodvinde -- claimed that they were   rescue snakes on their own without the backing of any organisation.
 
 Senior inspector Doiphode said that a probe will reveal other links in this matter. 
 
 "Earth boa snakes are usually used for black magic in India and there is a myth that the two-wided snake moves from one side for six months and uses the other side to move for the next six months of the year. Superstitious people think that possessing this snake will shower money on them," said Nitin Walmiki, an animal activist from  .
