ARA: Hundreds of students of Pasaur and Kauakhot government primary schools under Charpokhari block of Bhojpur district gathered on the Ara-Sasaram main road between 11am and 2pm on Tuesday in   against the lack of a proper school building and other basic amenities.

 Under the banner of Inkalabi Naujawan Sabha and AISA, the protesters held classes on the road and disrupted the traffic movement near Charpokhari Bazar for almost three hours. 
 
 Inkalabi Naujawan Sabha’s state president Manoj Manzil alleged that the Pasaur Urdu Primary School had been holding classes in a single room since 1947 as its land had been encroached by some “influential” people of the area. AISA district secretary Sabir, on the other hand, said the teachers of Kauakhot primary school had been teaching students in a community hall for 11 years.
 
 The blockade was lifted only after Piro SDM Sunil Kumar, DSP Jaiprakash Rai and Charpokhari CO Abun Asar assured the agitating pupils that the Pasaur Urdu Primary School would be freed from encroachments by May 25 and a proper land allotted to the Kauakhot primary school soon.
