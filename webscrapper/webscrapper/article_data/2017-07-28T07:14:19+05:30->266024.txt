SALEM/CHENNAI: Even as   launched its human chain protest across   against NEET on Thursday, high drama played out in chief minister   K Palaniwami's constituency in Salem district. 

 DMK functionaries blocked the   highway after the Coimbatore rural police arrested party working president M K  , who was heading to Edappadi to oversee the desilting work of Kacharayan lake. Traffic was halted on the stretch for more than three hours.
 
 Tension prevailed across the district as DMK cadre staged protests at various places, including Attur and Mettur, as news about Stalin's arrest spread. The demonstration staged at Salem collectorate turned violent as some party workers pelted stones at a government bus.
 
 Earlier, the district administration had denied permission to Stalin to visit the Kacharayan lake. As instructed by him, DMK workers had been carrying out desilting works of the lake for over a month. Stalin was scheduled to oversee the work.
 
 However on Tuesday, AIADMK workers and local farmers attempted to take silt from the lake using earthmovers and tractors. DMK workers clashed with them and subsequently district revenue officials stopped the work for a day. But officials on Wednesday allowed the ruling party members to take silt from the lake. Aggrieved about this, DMK functionaries staged protests across the district.
 
 Though the district administration denied him permission, Stalin announced that he would visit the lake as scheduled and was arrested while heading to Salem.Meanwhile, DMK, its allies and Left parties formed human chains in different parts of Tamil Nadu to protest against NEET. 
 
 In Chennai, 96-year-old DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan led the protest. TNCC chief S Thirunavukkarasar, CPI state general secretary R Muthurasan and other party leaders and members participated in the protest. They formed a 500-metre long human chain in Broadway in Chennai.
