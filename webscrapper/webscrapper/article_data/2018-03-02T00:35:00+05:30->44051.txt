Tirupur: The city corporation has submitted a revised detailed project report (DPR) on the fourth water scheme to the state government with an estimated project cost of Rs 1,122 crore.

 Initially, the plan was to supply 190MLD (million litters per day) water to the city from Bhavani River under the scheme. And the project cost was pegged at Rs 850 crore. However, the project report had to be revised as the quantity of the water to be supplied was increased to 250MLD, keeping in mind the population growth.
 
 “We did not modify master plan of the project, but have made only minor changes. The project will be executed with 50% contribution from Union government’s Amrut scheme and 20% fund from the state government. The remaining amount will be borrowed from the Asian Development Bank,” a senior corporation official said.TNN
