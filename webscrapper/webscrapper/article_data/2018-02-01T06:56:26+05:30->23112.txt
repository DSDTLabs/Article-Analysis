KOLKATA: Booklovers returning home on Wednesday from the Kolkata Book Fair in Salt Lake had a harrowing time as key roads were choked due to a 13,000-strong religious procession that crisscrossed the city till late evening.

 Major roads like the Park Circus connector, Maa flyover, Narkeldanga Main Road and Beliaghata Main Road remained out of bounds for vehicular movement till nearly 9pm.
 
 Arijit  , a Ripon Street resident, said, “I tried to take the Maa flyover from EM Bypass, but it was closed. I was directed to take the road under it. As I took the Park Circus connector, I realized that it was shut too. I was stuck for over 20 minutes before I was able to take a U-turn and move till Beliaghata crossing to take the Beliaghata Main Road. It took me almost an hour to reach Sealdah from EM Bypass.”
 
 Twenty tableaus participated in the procession celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass — a 14th century saint and reformer of the Bhakti movement in North India. The rally started from Ravidas Sarani near Park Cicrus 7- point crossing around 1pm and lasted six hours. It left traffic in east, central, north and parts of south Kolkata crippled. The rally moved through Park Circus, Park Street, Moulali, Sealdah, Rajabazar, Amherst Street, Wellington and Esplanade.
 
 “We were informed in advance about the rally, but the sheer number of participants were too much to handle. We tried our best to set in diversions and maintain traffic. However, traffic on routes that the procession followed, went out of gear,” a senior Kolkata Traffic Police officer said. Repeated police messages over Facebook and twitter asked commuters to avoid parts of central Kolkata where effects of the spillover had been felt.
 
 Motorists had a tough time even in the morning as a   administrative meeting headed by CM   at   in Alipore threw traffic out of gear from   till Esplanade.
