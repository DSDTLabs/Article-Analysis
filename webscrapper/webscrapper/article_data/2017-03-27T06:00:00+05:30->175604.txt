Delhi- based   rock band   amped up the anniversary celebrations of a ladies club in the city with their energetic performance on Friday. After beginning on a sombre note, the band upped the tempo with spunky renditions of Hindi chartbusters that were lapped up by the guests who scorched the dance floor with unbridled desi thumkas and jhatkas. By the time the show ended, everyone was on their feet. It was one rocking party that offered the   a perfect way to kick-off the weekend.
