GAYA: Struggling to hold back her tears, Chand Sachdeva, mother of  , on Monday deposed in the court of additional district and sessions judge S P Mishra as the eighth witness in the road rage case in which the schoolboy was killed allegedly by Rocky Yadav, son of JD (U) MLC Manorama Devi.
 
  Chand told the court that on May 7 last year, Aditya’s friend Nasir rang on her husband Shyam Sundar Sachdeva’s cellphone, saying Aditya has sustained gunshot injuries and that he has been admitted to the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital. When she, along with her husband, elder son and a nephew reached the hospital, Aditya was found lying dead with blood oozing out of his head. At time of the murder, Nasir was in the car with Aditya.
  
  Chand also told the court that her family did not have any contact or relation with Rocky’s family. “There was no enmity between the two families,” said Chand. She told the court that her son was shot while coming back from Bodh Gaya as his vehicle overtook the Land Rover of the accused.
  
  Chand’s testimony has come as a relief to the prosecution as six of the eight witnesses, including four of Aditya’s friends, who were present at the site of occurrence, had made a U turn in the court and were subsequently declared hostile. The two police constables deputed at the MLC's AP Colony residence had also turned hostile. Rocky’s trial will now resume on February 9.
  
  Playing down Chand’s testimony, defence lawyer   said her testimony has little evidentiary value, as she was just a ‘hearsay’ witness who had not seen the crime happening.
