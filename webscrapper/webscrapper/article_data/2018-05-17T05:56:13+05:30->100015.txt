MUMBAI: Directorate Revenue of Intelligence ( ) on Wednesday arrested   agent   (32) in a Rs 10 crore duty drawback case. The accused, who had access to some senior Customs officials' computers, would remove 'alerts' from suspicious persons' names. 

 
 An 'alert' is issued after Customs finds some transactions dubious and suspicious, preventing the person or company from availing the drawback facility unless the matter is sorted out. Two deputy commissioners are likely to be questioned.
 
 DRI has so far arrested five persons in the case. Sources said the drawback, given as an incentive for exports, was held back in some cases for investigation by the Customs department. The fraudsters allegedly procured details and got the money released and diverted to different accounts.
 
 "Singh, a Kalyan resident, had access to some senior officials' computers and he would remove 'alerts' against suspicious persons and companies. He is a key accused in the case. Investigators are likely to question some senior government officials," said a source.
 
 Last month, the DRI's Mumbai unit had arrested businessmen and Customs agents, Sadruddin Lassanwala, Ramesh Singh, Mohammed Shaikh alias Arif and Arjun Goregaonkar.
