MYSURU: Taking a peek into 54-year-old   chest is to be given a glimpse into a map – one studded with glinting coins.

 A numismatist, Shreemathi has been collecting coins for 35 years, and her collection boasts currencies of 120 countries. A native of Sringeri, Shreemathi was a postal assistant who quit her job following her marriage to Arunkumar, an official with  .
 
 Among her collection of 300 Indian coins are those issued when the country was under the thumb of the English  . She also has coins from various countries such as Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Bhutan, England, Malaysia and Russia among others.
 
 It was her father, Shammaiah Kerodi who inspired Shreemathi to take up the interesting hobby when she was still a child, and her passion for the metallic pieces of history remains undiminished till today.
 
 “My father gave me some rare coins, and I personally purchased some of them at exhibitions conducted at Mysuru and other places. Friends and relatives who have settled in foreign countries, or who regularly travel abroad bring me coins that have expanded and enriched my collection,” said Shreemathi.
 
 Arunkumar, who has now retired from service, and her daughter, Sharadhi, support Shreemathi in pursuing her passion. “Apart from collecting coins, I also do embroidery and art work on steel plates and fabric. I also make small bags, handpurses and other craft pieces which I sell,” said Shreemathi.
 
 If her passion for coins was imbibed from her father, Shreemathi learnt art from her mother. Shreemathi has, in fact, won prizes for her artistic creations during the Mysuru Dasara exhibition and youth festival.
