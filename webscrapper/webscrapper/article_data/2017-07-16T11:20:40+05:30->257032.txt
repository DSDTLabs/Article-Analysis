GUWAHATI: The death toll in   reached 60 after seven more people were reported dead on Saturday. Twenty four districts remain affected even though the water level of the Brahmaputra and its major tributaries are showing signs of receding at several places.

 Among the seven dead, two are from Sivasagar and one each from Morigaon, Bongaigaon, South Salmara, Sonitpur and Jorhat districts. Finance minister   said, “Our focus is on providing relief but the character of the affected people in terms of getting relief has changed over the years. Unlike in the past, people no longer come to relief camps but prefer to stay at home. Reaching out to these people with relief is a challenge. But there is no lack of will on our part.“
 
 Taking relief on mechanised or speed boats to each village takes ti me and a boat can travel to only one village in a day, said Sarma. “With water all around, it is also impossible to opt for air dropping relief materials,“ he added. “We have instructed all deputy commissioners in the affected districts to distribute relief materials liberally. There is no dearth of funds,“ Sarma said. He added that the government, in a first, is providing fodder to animals at Kaziranga National Park at their shelters set up on highlands.
 
 According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the number of people affected in floods has come down to a little below 12 lakh from almost 18 lakh two days ago. So far, the government has distributed 4,600 quintals of rice, 855 quintals of dal, 349 quintals of salt and more than 400 litres of mustard oil to the affected people. ASDMA has reported that floodwaters inside Kaziranga National Park have receded considerably, though 52% of the park is still inundated.
