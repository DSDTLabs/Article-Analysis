KOCHI: Students from districts across the state gathered at  , Tripunithura, to discuss a range of issues varying from `ethics of healthcare in warzones' to 'reviewing reservation in India' at the second edition of the Indian International Mock  ' ( ) Kochi Chapter, which was held at the school on Saturday and Sunday.

 The objective of the MUN is to allow the student community to experience multilateral negotiations.
 
 “Reservation system in India can be a sensitive topic. It is important that children understand and discuss these issues as they are the voters of tomorrow. We are assigning political position to students and in many cases they will be researching and defending a stance which they were opposed prior to the event. This allows them to explore and understand other perspectives,“ said Prashant Nagpal, a member of IIMUN, who is currently doing his masters in commerce at Mumbai University.
