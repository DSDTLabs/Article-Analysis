 ( ):   (21) was tired after day-long shopping for her marriage, which was due on May 11. From the main road, she had walked towards the village, along with her cousin Shagun (16), carrying shopping bags in their hands. Just a km before the accident spot they asked for lift in the ill-fated school bus and within few minutes both were dead in the accident.

 Father Balraj Singh and mother Suman Devi could not believe their ears when someone informed them about the tragic incident. Shocked, they are not in a position to speak to anyone. The house, which had been given a fresh coat of paint for Poonam’s marriage function, now wears a deserted look. 
 
 Poonam was the eldest in the family and has a younger sister and brother. As this was the first function in the family, everybody was excited. Priyanka, one of her cousins, said that Poonam had bought new dresses for her marriage and she had been trying those for the last few days. “She was very excited about her marriage and had told us that she would not wear any old dress at least for six months after marriage,” she added.
 
 Sumna Devi (42), a relative, said that Poonam and Shagun were very close to each other and on Monday, Poonam had called her cousin to help her in shopping for her marriage. She said that together they had gone to the market for shopping in the morning hours. “While returning home, they took lift from the Malakwal bus spot and after covering one km the tragic incident took place. Our entire world has been shattered as we lost our two daughters,” she said.
 
 Family and relatives, who otherwise were preparing for Poonam’s marriage for the last many months, gave a tearful farewell to her, along with Shagun. “We are cursing the moment when she decided to take lift in the school bus,” said Krishna Devi, a villager.
