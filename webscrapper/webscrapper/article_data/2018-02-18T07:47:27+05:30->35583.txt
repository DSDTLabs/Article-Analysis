CHENNAI:   between couples should not deny their children the care and affection of both the parents, said the  , observing any attempt to stop the child from meeting or spending time with the other parent would only make the child ‘spoilt one’.

 The court then imposed Rs 2,000 as cost on a wife who disobeyed a court order by not allowing her husband to spend time with their child.
 
 The issue pertains to a contempt petition moved by a husband seeking the court’s intervention to meet his child and to punish his wife for wilful disobedience of a court order. 
 
 Due to some misunderstandings his wife left her marital home on March 28, 2015 leaving her child there. Later, she filed a case for custody of the child. Since a criminal complaint was registered against the petitioner, he moved the high court and obtained anticipatory bail on October 6, 2015 subject to the condition that he should hand over the child’s custody to his wife. The court also allowed him to meet the child twice in weekends.
 
 Subsequently, when the petitioner tried to meet and spend time with his child, his wife allegedly refused to allow him to meet the child, prompting the petitioner to approach the court.
