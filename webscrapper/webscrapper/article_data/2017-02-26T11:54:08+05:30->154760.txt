MUMBAI: Close to 70% of the   poll's winners are firsttime corporators. Thus, only 72 of 227 corporators in the new civic house are repeat faces, experienced in the BMC's functioning. Of them, 52 are sitting corporators who have been re-elected consecutively, and the remaining 20 have been elected after a gap owing to either losing the 2012 election or not contesting after their seats came under quotas.

 Some say this imbalance in experience may come to bear on debates and decisions on policy matters, while others say that the enthusiasm of the first-timers is important in any civic body , where most issues concern basic matters like water supply and cleanliness.
 
 Political experts say the composition of the new house is a result of the civic poll's multi-cornered contests after traditional allies broke off and went separate ways, fielding many more candidates than they would otherwise do.
 
 “For instance, a party like the  , which contested 211 seats this year, never before contested more than 70. So, they had to give tickets to many freshers. The sons and daughters of veterans were thus given tickets by all the parties in the fray,“ said an analyst.
 
 A second reason is the quota system, mainly 50% reservation for women. In such seats, seasoned male corporators fielded their wives or daughters, planning to pull the strings after the polls. Sitting corporators like the  's Mohsin Haider and Sunil More, the BJP's  , and the  's Arvind Dudhwadkar, Prakash Patankar and  , nominated their wives, all of whom won, becoming first-time corporators.
