MUMBAI: Either the Panvel-CSMT hi-speed corridor or the Thane-GPO Metro IV will cater to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus since the authorities have decided that building both along an almost identical route south of   is not viable.

 
 MMRDA had proposed to extend the   IV up to GPO. The proposed 8-km extension was to be built largely underground. Going by the Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation’s (MRVC) plans for the Panvel-CSMT hi-speed corridor, the routes will run parallel to each other between Wadala and CSMT.
 
 At a meeting between CM   and railway minister Piyush   on January 12, it was decided that there was no point in replicating routes that will cater to the same commuter pockets. Ridership will be low for both, and revenue will be hit. Source said Goyal suggested that one of the corridors can be curtailed at Wadala, and an interchange made available so that those planning to continue south can take the other.
 
 “One of the two corridors will come to south Mumbai to avoid duplication. Preference will be given to Metro. In that case, Panvel-CSMT may have to be curtailed at Wadala. MMRDA and MRVC will jointly work that out,” metropolitan commissioner U P S Madan told TOI.
 
 It could unleash a tug-ofwar between MMRDA and MRVC as both agencies will want their network to come all the way up to CSMT.
 
 “It is ideal that the Harbour line corridor comes up to CSMT because this network will also provide connectivity to the Navi Mumbai airport. The Metro corridor will cater to the eastern suburbs and Thane,” said an MRVC official.
 
 Wadala will soon emerge as a major hub for transport. Besides Metro IV, it will also be an important junction for monorail. Also, Eastern   is close to this area.
 
 MMRDA has also planned to build a BKC like business district in Wadala with space earmarked for residences too. The master plan was recently approved by MMRDA and the clearance from the state government is expected by May.
