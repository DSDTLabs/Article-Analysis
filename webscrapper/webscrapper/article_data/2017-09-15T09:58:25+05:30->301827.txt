I am told that ABVP lost because the other candidate had a similar name, resulting in a narrow loss. If this kind of a statistical victory is perceived by Congress as wind of change, let it live under that illusion.
 
 
 
 
 The statement by Rahul Gandhi is a national disgrace and an onslaught on the wisdom of Indian people. I think it’s time the real potential of Indian democracy was realised. And it will be realised on merit, and merit alone. The ability of leading a group should determine leadership. 
 
 India has been producing world leaders in various fields. Our scientists, researchers, doctors, engineers are world beaters. It’s a national disgrace for someone to say that so far politics is concerned, we can only depend on a few families. I think India deserves much better than leadership based only on dynasty. 
 
 
 
 
 Whatever taxes we collect on oil and other products directly goes into public spending like building infrastructure. Don’t we want rural roads being built and national highways to be built how are these funded. They will come up only when consumers pay through indirect tax.
