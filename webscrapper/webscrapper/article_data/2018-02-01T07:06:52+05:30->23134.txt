GURGAON: A 32-year-old man has been arrested for sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl and also threatening to kill her. 

 
 According to the police, the girl along with her father approached the   police station on Tuesday evening and filed a complaint against the accused, identified as Anil  , for sexually harassing the girl and also traumatising her. 
 
 
 The girl, who is a class VI student, told cops that Kumar was harassing her for past several days but the fear of him harming her or her family members forced her to keep quiet. Her patience finally gave way on Tuesday when the accused blocked her way, when she was returning home from school, and threatened to kill her when she objected to his advances. She came back home and on seeing her father broke down. After some persuasion, the girl told her father that Kumar had been harassing her from past few days. She revealed that the accused on a regular basis passed lewd comments on her when she returned from school. He often caught hold of her or grabbed her hand or groped her when she objected. 
 
 
 “I was shocked to hear that this 32-year-old man was harassing my daughter for so many days. I have seen Kumar inside the village and know that he stays nearby. He is a drunkard. I wasted no time after my daughter told me about it and immediately approached the cops to file a complaint. Strict action should be taken against him so that he does not dare to repeat such shameful act in future,” the girl’s father said. 
 
 
 Following the complaint, an FIR was registered against Kumar under Section 12 (sexual harassment) of the POCSO Act and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the   at Bhondsi police station.
 
 
 Kumar was arrested on Wednesday and produced in a city court that sent him to judicial custody. 
 
 
 “The accused, who is a liquor addict, has confessed to his crime and said that he harassed the girl under the influence of alcohol,” said inspector  , SHO, Bhondsi police station.
