NAMAKKAL: State electricity minister P   hit out at DMK working president M K Stalin for demanding the resignation of health minister C  .

 Talking to reporters in   on Tuesday, Thangamani questioned whether any of the DMK leaders resigned when they faced allegations of corruption in 2G scam. He was referring to the statement by Stalin demanding chief minister   to sack Vijaya Baskar and the Tamil Nadu Director General of Police T K Rajendran after the Madras high court ordered a CBI probe into gutkha scam. 
 
 “Why didn’t DMK leaders quit when 2G scam broke out? They have the right to demand resignation if Stalin had set an example then by getting DMK men accused in the scam to quit,’’ Thangamani said.
 
 When asked about allegations of irregularities in cooperative polls, Thangamani said that the elections were held as per law. “Those defeated in the polls were raising the allegations for political mileage,’’ he said.
