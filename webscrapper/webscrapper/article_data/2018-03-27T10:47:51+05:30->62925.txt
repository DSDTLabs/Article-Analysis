UDHAGAMANDALAM: The   has started destroying adulterated tea weighing about two lakh kg seized from two private tea factories in the Nilgiris. 

 Jayalakshmi Tea Industry and S R Tea Industry, both located near   near  , were indulging in adulteration of a magnitude unheard in South India, Tea Board sources said. After receiving information about the adulteration, a raid was conducted last December.
 
 Tea board officials collected samples from the factories and sent them for lab test. "We received the lab report in January, which stated that the teas were adulterated using a colouring agent," executive director of Tea Board (South) C   told TOI.
 
 Subsequently, the board cancelled the licenses of both the factories. As burning of the adulterated tea would cause air pollution, salt and lime is mixed with the tea powder and water, which is then buried in a pit for natural decay. Later, it could be used as manure.
 
 "As we have to destroy a huge quantity of the adulterated tea, the process is taking place in a phased manner. It will take more than a week to complete it," said Tea board official Vivek, who is in charge of the work.
