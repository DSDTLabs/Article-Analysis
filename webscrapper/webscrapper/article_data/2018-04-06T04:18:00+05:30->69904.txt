Nagpur: Slamming   for neglecting infrastructure in north Nagpur, standing committee chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Vicky Kukreja and north Nagpur MLA Dr Milind Mane directed the power franchisee to augment its distribution network.

 A special meeting was held between SNDL, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd and NMC’s electricity department wherein the leaders assured that required funds would be made available to the franchisee.
 
 Kukreja said that power infrastructure of north Nagpur was poorest in the city. Electric poles had not been erected in many areas and several complaints had been received from citizens in this regard. Several corporators have asked SNDL to erect poles, the total number being 400. Slamming SNDL, Kukreja pointed out that many poles sanctioned earlier had not been erected so far.
 
 Power breakdowns and voltage fluctuations have become common in north Nagpur and hence SNDL should install distribution transformers on war footing. Tree branches overhanging on electric cables should be trimmed before monsoon and new connections should be released within stipulated period, the standing panel chief said.
 
 Dr Mane said that he would ensure that there was no paucity of funds for infrastructure works. Funds would be made available from the NMC’s standing committee funds, special funds for scheduled castes and local area development funds of MLAs. Many corporators attended the meeting and aired their grievances against SNDL.
