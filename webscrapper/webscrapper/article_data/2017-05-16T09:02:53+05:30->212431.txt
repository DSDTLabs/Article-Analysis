Panaji: After two decades, the state government has initiated the process of filling 50% posts of deputy superintendent of   (DySP) through direct recruitment with retrospective effect from 1998. If chief minister Manohar Parrikar clears the proposal, the Goa police will recruit 12 direct DySPs. 

 In all, there are 32 DySPs’ posts, of which 11 were filled, while 21 vacancies are yet to be filled.
 
 In 1997, the state police had directly recruited six DySPs some of whom have been inducted into the Indian Police Service, while a few have have been promoted as superintendent of police (SP).
 
 A senior government officer said the papers for direct recruitment of DySPs have been sent to the chief minister for his approval. “The chief minister has not taken any decision yet,” he added.
 
 He said the chief minister was of the opinion that there was a need for new blood in the police department.
 
  The state government had initiated a similar exercise in 2012 immediately after Parrikar had taken over the reins of the state, but could not complete the process as senior police officers protested against the move.
 
 The core committee report on police training had also opposed direct recruitments to the post of DySPs as “direct entry into the rank of DySP reduces the chances of subordinate ranks for promotion and is a serious impediment in the development of correct attitudes and values”. 
 
 According to Rule 5 of the Goa Police Service Rules, 1997, 20% of the vacancies of the junior scale (DySP) should be filled by direct recruitment, while the remaining 80% of the vacancies were to be filled by promoting officers, who substantively hold the post of PI, on a regular basis for a minimum period of five years under the Goa government. However, the state government had issued a notification on December 8, 2011, stating that only 50% of serving officers of the rank of PI would be promoted to the post of DySP, while another 50% would be filled by direct recruitment.
