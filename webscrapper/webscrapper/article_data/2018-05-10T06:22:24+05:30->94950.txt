CHENNAI: A Chennai-based businessman and his friend were arrested by police on Wednesday after a Thai woman complained that they had sexually assaulted and cheated her. 

 The 26-year-old woman, Naruemon Japai, sent a complaint to the Prime Minister's office in New Delhi via the Thai embassy seeking legal action against the men. Japai's communication was forwarded to the Chennai city police commissioner's office. 
 
 Japai, who sells garments at a small shop in Bangkok, said she met Jain at a pub in Bangkok in 2011 during one of his visits there to order toy manufacturing units. She claimed that Jain spiked her drinks and sexually assaulted her. Later, he maintained a relationship with her after promising marriage and the couple travelled to China and several other countries. Japai also gave birth to a boy and a girl who live with her.
 
 Japai said Jain took her to a registrar office in Bangkok to formalise their marriage. He was accompanied by his friends Santhosh and Vikas Kothari, who runs a business supplying chemicals to pharmaceutical companies. Japai said she realised later that Santhosh had signed the marriage certificate as the bridegroom. 
 
 Later, Japai approached a Thai court and divorced Santhosh in 2017. In her complaint, Japai mentioned that Kothari also attempted to sexually assault her in her apartment.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police C Shyamala Devi of the Investigation Unit of Crimes Against Women questioned Jain, 43, and Kothari, 42, both of Sowcarpet, at the Chennai city commissioner's office before they were arrested. They will be remanded in prison after being produced before a magistrate court in Allikulam on Thursday.
 
 Since Japai claimed that Jain is the father of her children, police plan to perform DNA tests on both of them as well as the two kids. Police have also launched a hunt for Santhosh.
