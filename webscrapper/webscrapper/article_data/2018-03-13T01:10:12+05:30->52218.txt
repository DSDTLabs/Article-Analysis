NEW DELHI: At 2.43am, the police control room received a call from   informing them “bahut bada   hua hai (a huge accident has occurred)”. Within the next five minutes, a PCR van, a quick reaction team, an ambulance and a fire tender were rushed to the spot. The teams found a large section of the divider leading to the   destroyed and a white i20 turned turtle at the end.

 Abhay Kumar, a delivery boy at a café in the area, had just parked his motorcycle around 2.40am when he saw the speeding car. “The car driver lost control at the turn. The speed must have been around 120kmph when the vehicle crashed into the divider. It got flung high into the air before landing upside down. The car dragged on for a few metres before crashing into the traffic signal,” he said, adding that there were bottles lying in the car.
 
 Kumar, his co-workers and passersby ran towards the wreckage and found that the passengers in the backseat were trapped. “I managed to pull out one of the girls seated in front. The two men in the back seat were not moving. When I asked others to help me, they chose to make a video instead. Other didn’t want to get involved as it was a police matter. I then dialled 100,” he said.
 
 The first responders, including a patrolling team led by ACP (Model Town) Hukma Ram, found it hard to extract those in the back seat as the roof had caved in. Soon, the injured were taken to   in an ambulance.
 
 TOI accessed a mobile video shot moments after the accident in which parts of the car were found scattered on the street. A large section of the divider had been reduced to debris and the traffic signal had been knocked down. One of the women occupants in a yellow dress was seen standing next to the car surrounded by people trying to talk to her.
