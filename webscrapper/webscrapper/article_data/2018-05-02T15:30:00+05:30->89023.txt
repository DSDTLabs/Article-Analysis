The card for his daughter Jahana Bano’s wedding sent to guests from Hindu community has picture of Ram and Sita, standing behind a ceremonial fire. It also has other traditional Hindu ‘pooja’ items such as kalash, lamps, banana leaves and even a‘pooja thali’ replete with coconut, flowers and fruits. 
 
 The card is in the form of a scroll . When Saleem distributed the card among his Hindu friends, they got a pleasant surprise. Those in the Muslim community also accepted the step positively and appreciated Saleem’s gesture.
 
 “I wish to bridge the gap between the religious beliefs of Hindus and Muslims. It is a goodwill gesture for my Hindu brothers who also respect our religion with their heart. If we respect their religious personalities, they will definitely show respect for the Muslim community,” said Saleem.
 
 Radhey Shyam Tiwari, a neighbour of Saleem, said, “By printing the photographs of Lord Ram and Mother Sita, Saleem bhai has proven how much Muslims respect the Hindu religion. Moreover, no one from the Muslim community has criticized this act of Saleem. This is highly appreciable.”
