AHMEDABAD: A retrospective of the works of   Award winning artist and   was displayed at the   on Friday. The 150 paintings displayed at the museum spanned 60 years of Parekh’s works and will be on display till June 3. 

 A commemorative book of the same title in collaboration with Union ministry of culture was also brought out. 
 
 Parekh’s early work explored the relationship between man and nature, which according to him was an energetic link that had to be celebrated. Since then, contradictions have formed the basis of his artistic practice, no matter the subject or genre of his works. 
 
 “Kasturbhai Lalbhai Museum is very pleased to host this retrospective of the artist Manu Parekh. The museum will continue to try and bring different and varied forms of art to Ahmedabad,” said Jayshree Lalbhai, trustee,   Museum. 
 
 Polemics have always intrigued   – the energy of the organic form and the inherent sexuality within these forms are intangible elements in his works. 
 
 His paintings provoke viewers to take notice of the world around them through the emotion, pain and anguish expressed in the subjects of his paintings.
