Mysuru: Mysore Industries Association has established   helpdesk to facilitate entrepreneurs to obtain Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum (UAM) and upload information to MSME databank with nominal service charges.

 Association secretary Suresh Kumar Jain on Thursday said, “To ease business for MSMEs, the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) has renamed MSME registration as UAM and introduced online registration under the MSMED Act, 2016, linked with Aadhaar card.”
 
 The MSMEs need to be registered under the UAM to avail the benefits provided under various government schemes and facilities, including exemption from obtaining trade license by corporation, municipalities and other local bodies.
 
 Apart from this, the central government has also created MSME data bank, where all the MSMEs should compuslarily upload their details through the portal www.msmedatabank.in. 
 
 “In this direction, the association has set-up MSME   to help all entrepreneurs to obtain UAM and to upload information to databank, for the benefit of our members and non-members,” he said.
 
 Jain requested the members to submit photocopies of the Aadhaar card and pan card of the proprietor, managing partner and managing director, along with the bank account details and IFSC code, to Mysore Industries Association at KIADB on KRS Road at Metagalli.
