Kanyakumari: Stating that the ruling BJP came to power by exposing the new liberalisation policy and corruption in the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre for 10 years, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday charged the BJP of following in the footsteps of the Congress. Emphasising the need for an alternative policy, Vijayan added that the Left alone has the solution to bring about the policy and people should support it. He was addressing cadre of the CPM at the valedictory of the three-day 22nd district level conference at Monday Market here. Vijayan also hit out at the Centre on the privatisation of public sector enterprises and impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax on the livelihood of the common man.  He alleged that more people have lost their jobs, contrary to the promise made by the government to create more jobs. On the damage caused by Cyclone Ockhi, which left hundreds dead and missing and also completely affecting the livelihood of many, Vijayan said the Centre should allot more funds towards Ockhi relief.  He added that despite financial instability, Kerala government has earmarked Rs 2,000 crore towards Ockhi relief and rehabilitation.
