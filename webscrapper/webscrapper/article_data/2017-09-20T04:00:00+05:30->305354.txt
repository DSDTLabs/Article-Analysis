Vadodara: After Ganesh festivities passed off peacefully, city police are taking no chance for Navratri too. Apart from increasing the vigil in the city, the police have demanded additional force from home department to avoid any untoward incident during the nine night revelries.

 To maintain the situation of law and order during Navratri, the city police have asked for two companies of Rapid Action Force, seven companies of State Reserve Police and 1,500 Home Guards. The city police have a force of around 3,000 cops.
 
 “We have demanded additional troops because immediately after Navratri ends, Taziya will be immersed. We will have round-the-clock monitoring of all the areas and also formed quick response team,” said Manoj Sashidhar, commissioner of police.
 
 Police officials said they have divided garba events into three categories. Garbas at residential societies will be identified as small event, at party plots will be medium event and those at big-sized grounds will be known as large events. “Policemen will be deployed at these locations according to their categories,” said a police official.
 
 For the benefits and enjoyment of revellers, the city police will also extend closing time for eateries and restaurants.
