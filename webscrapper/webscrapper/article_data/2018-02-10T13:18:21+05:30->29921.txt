Ranchi: The CMD of Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd (HEC),  , on Friday refuted rumours regarding the Centre's divestment plan for the company. 

 He said, "We have not received any communication from the Union government so far. There is no reason to give credence to these reports as the HEC is functioning normally."
 
 However,   MP Ramtahal   told TOI that Union minister for heavy industries and public enterprises   had cast aspersion on the HEC at a recent meeting in New Delhi and said that the Centre was mulling plans for the revival of the Ranchi-based corporation. 
 
 "I had gone to meet Anant Geete in Delhi to request for sanction of special funds so that wage arrears of the HEC workers, pending since January 1997, could be paid at the earliest. During the course of the discussions, the minister remarked that all was not well at HEC and that efforts were on, at the highest levels, to keep the corporation afloat," Choudhury said. 
 
 He added, "A petition praying for the revival of HEC, signed by 10 BJP MPs from  , including myself, has been submitted to the Prime Minister's Office. A copy of the petition has also been handed over to minister Geete."
