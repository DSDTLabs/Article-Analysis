NEW DELHI: Senior   leader   today questioned the audacity of someone who has never won an election making a personal attack on him like   did yesterday.

 "He (Jaitley) has made this personal by calling me a 'job applicant'. He delivered a well researched speech but overlooked (LK) Advani Ji's advice to refrain from personal attacks. That's okay though, I'm happy he made a personal attack," said Sinha, tongue firmly in cheek.
 
 Jaitley yesterday called Sinha "a job applicant at 80" because the latter criticised his performance as  . Jaitley also faulted Sinha's tenure as finance minister. 
 
  Sinha said Jaitley didn't have a leg to stand on because he hasn't ever endured the blood sweat and tears of caring for one's constituency and is merely a political appointee, so wouldn't know much about real responsibilities.
 
 "I didn't come to politics after retirement. I left my post in the IAS (Indian Administrative Service), so I could not be asking for job at the age of 80 yrs," said Sinha a former   finance minister himself.
 
  In fact, after Jaitley's comment late yesterday, Sinha told a national daily that if he were "a job applicant, he (Jaitley) would not be there in the first place". 
 
 Jaitley had criticised Sinha's tenure as finance minister in the Vajpayee government, saying that during that period non-performing assets of banks were at 14-15% of their loans. Sinha was finance minister from 1998 to 2002.
 
 "They say I was useless as a minister. How could they have given me the ministry of external affairs if I was so useless," asked Sinha.
