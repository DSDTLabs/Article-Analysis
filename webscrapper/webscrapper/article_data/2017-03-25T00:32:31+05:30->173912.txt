MUMBAI: Parents of three students from an ICSE school in   has complained to the state child rights   that the children have not been attending classes for five months over a   dispute. A parents’ group in the city alleged that schools overcharge for delayed fee payment.

 “The school has collected Rs 25,000 per child as donation and has told us to pay fees for the entire semester in advance. Since there are three children, paying for the entire semester together is difficult. The school is also demanding a   fee of Rs 7,100. The school is not allowing the children to attend classes for five months,” said the father, who has written to Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.
 
 But the school authorities said they only told the parents to move the children to their state board school, which is aided by the government. “The parents have not been able to pay the fees for two years. We have a state board school on the same campus, so we told the parents to move the children. But the parents have disagreed, so the children are not attending school,” said the school’s trustee.
 
 Forum for Fairness in Education, an NGO that complained to the commission on the parents’ behalf, said several schools were overcharging parents when it comes to late payment. “Rules allow schools to charge only Re 1 per day but schools charge up to Rs 100. Due to this, the burden increases on parents who are trying to make ends meet to pay fees,” said forum president Jayant Jain.
 
 Education department officials said there was enough machinery in place for parents to seek help. “Parents can complain to the education office concerned and action will be taken against schools overcharging or not taking fees according to the rulebook,” said B B Chavan, deputy director of education.
