MARGAO: The villagers of   have strongly opposed the recent auction of   of basalt stone, located in the village, by the comunidade of Curtorim.

 Stating that the auction of as much as 90,000 sqm of hilly land would cause the hills to disappear, they also expressed their opposition to hill-cutting in the village. 
 
 Pointing out to the existence of over 40 quarries in the village that were shut down following protests by citizens, the villagers said, “The quarries have created a number of huge pits, each having a depth of over 20 metres due to illegal blasting activity. During the last five years, over five deaths have occurred due to drowning in these pits. The comunidade of Curtorim, as well as the government authorities concerned, have failed to restore the lands by filling the pits,” president of the Sao Jose de Areal Villagers Union Fidelis Travasso, said.
 
 He also said the issue would be raised at the forthcoming gram sabha scheduled for Sunday and threatened that the villagers would launch an agitation if the authorities failed to resolve it.
