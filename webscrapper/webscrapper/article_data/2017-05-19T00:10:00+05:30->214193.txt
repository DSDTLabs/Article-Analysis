Indore: Reacting to allegations that Rs 2000 was being taken from each person to verify and forward their documents to the official liquidator,   Mill labour union leader on Thursday submitted before the Indore bench of high court that the money was being given to them voluntarily by the workers.

 The union leaders also brought around hundred workers to the court who agreed with the union leaders’ statements and said they had given the money voluntarily.
 
 The allegation that union leaders demanded money from workers was made on Wednesday before Justice Prakash Shrivastav by two workers through senior advocate Anand Mohan Mathur. He alleged the union leaders were engaged in corruption and that a magisterial probe regarding the money being taken should be conducted.
 
 The court had directed the labour union to file its reply to these allegations on Thursday. In it, union leaders Narendra Shrivansh and Harnam Singh Dhariwal told the court they had championed the cause of the workers for the past 24 years and that they had incurred a lot of expenses in pushing forward with the litigation. Whatever money they received from workers was given by their own free will, they added.
 
 The official liquidator also defended the labour union leaders. “The objection had been raised before the court regarding this on Wednesday, after which we halted distribution of money. However, we restarted it on Thursday. We told the court that we needed help from the labour union since the official liquidator cannot verify each person’s documents with the limited staff provided to us,” said advocate HY Mehta, official liquidator MK Sahu’s representative.
 
 Till now, Sahu has received around 2,000 applications and money has been disbursed to nearly 150 workers. Over the next three months, the entire sum will be distributed, Mehta added.
