CUTTACK: Jaundice has returned to haunt the city again with reports of fresh cases from various areas. At least 25 people are suffering from the disease, said an official.

 
 The waterborne disease has broken out in several places like Mansing Patana, Ramgarh, Siddheswar Sahi and Maskri Lane of ward 10 of the city. The affected persons might have consumed polluted water, the official added.
 
 "Most of the drinking water pipes are exposed to drains where the water gets contaminated," said  , a resident of Ramgarh . His nine-year-old daughter   is suffering from jaundice. "We have been drinking water supplied by Public Health Engineering Organisation. Authorities are least concerned to supply safe water," alleged resident of Mansinghpatana, Nayantika Barik, whose eight-year-old granddaughter has fallen ill.
 
 "Under a project, Odisha Water Supply and Sewerage Board (OWSSB) has been doing sewer construction work as a result all the drinking water pipes are exposed to drains. Delay in construction work is further contaminating piped water," rued  , corporator of ward 10. 
 
 The OWSSB project director, Basant Parida, rubbished the allegations and said, "We have almost finished the construction work in most parts of the ward. Our teams have taken precautions to avoid water contamination." The   (CMC) formed three teams on Sunday to check the spread of the disease.
 
 When asked, CMC commissioner   admitted water contamination due to leaking pipelines. He said, "We will arrange drinking water tanks for distribution of water in those areas from Monday. An awareness campaign will be launched and health workers will do door-to-door survey in the jaundice-affected areas for detection of patients."
