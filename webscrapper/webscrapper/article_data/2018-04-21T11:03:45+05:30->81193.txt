KANNUR: The management of  , which has been taken over by the government to convert it into an autonomous institution, has served notice to the   students who got admission last year to remit the fees as per the fees structure for the self financing colleges.

 According to the notice, all the students who got admission under the merit quota have to pay an additional amount of Rs 2.35 lakh in addition to the Rs 2.5 lakh they paid earlier.
 
 The college management said the decision has been taken as per the recommendation of  , which said the fees should be made uniform in the government quota and management quota in the self financing colleges and the fees has been fixed at Rs 4.85 lakh.
 
 When contacted, PMCH managing director   said the college had earlier reached an agreement with the government, as per which the fees was fixed at Rs 2.5 lakh per year. However, after the Rajendrababu Committee fixed the fees, it insisted that all self-financing colleges should have uniform fees structure, and hence the decision.
 
 He said only the government can take a decision regarding the reduction of the fees and it is quite unlikely that the students would get any fees waiver now, as they got admission when the college was in the self financing sector. He also said since the fees for the management quota also has been reduced to Rs 4.48 lakh instead of Rs 10 lakh, the additional amount would be refunded to the students who have remitted the higher amount under management quota.
 
 But it has come as a shocker to the students who sought admission in PMCH in the hope that the fees would be less, and sources close to the students hinted that they might launch an agitation.
