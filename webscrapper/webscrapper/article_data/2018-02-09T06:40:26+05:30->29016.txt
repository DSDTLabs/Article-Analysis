Earlier, students caught with a phone would lose two years.

 Students making signs to cheat, especially at multiple-choice questions, will now be failed in the subject they were caught copying in. Earlier, there was no penalty for this.
 
 Chairman of the board A J Shah said that the strict guidelines have been issued to curb copying in the board exams, scheduled to begin on March 12. More than 15 lakh SSC and HSC students will take the board exams this year.
 
 There is a common means of cheating among students, especially in rural areas, to throw answer sheets outside the exam hall which is then sent back to them with the answers. The new rules stipulate that entire result of the student will be cancelled for this offence. Earlier, a copying case was filed and the result of just that one subject was cancelled.
 
  
  
 
 A student who tears up the answer sheet of another will have his entire result cancelled. For students who runs away with blank answer sheets — there have been many instances where students sneak away supplementary answersheets — will lose two years as they will be failed in the current exam and will not be allowed to take the exam held next year. If students are caught communicating, either through signs or verbally, their result for the subject will be cancelled.
 
 “These strict punishments for copying have been communicated to schools. Schools have been told to display them on the notice board, to make students aware of the consequences,” said Shah.
