After essaying an understanding and loving wife Latha to Anoop Menon's character in the latest Mohanlal-starrer, actress   is all set to play a nagging one in debutant director Senthil Rajan's movie  .

 She plays Chandini, who is the wife of  's character Giri in the comic entertainer. 'Giri is always strapped for cash and while he is running around to tackle his monetary issues, his wife keeps annoying him,' says the director. 'Chandini is a typical Chandrettan Evideya-style wife who keeps on calling her husband without even giving a thought of what he's going through in his life.'
 
 The film's plot evolves as Giri goes broke after trying his hand at different businesses due to the pressure from Chandini's family. 'Srinda's character sides with her family and keeps blaming her husband for not meeting their expectations, and getting his act right,' he says.
 Kadam Katha also has Joju George and Renji Panicker playing pivotal roles.
