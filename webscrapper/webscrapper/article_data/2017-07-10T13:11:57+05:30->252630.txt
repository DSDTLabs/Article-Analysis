AMARAVATI: Taking ruling   (TDP) by surprise, YSRCP president and leader of the Opposition YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Sunday decided to accomplish   through the time-tested padayatra route. 

 Jagan, who was re-elected as   on Sunday , will begin a sixmonth-long walk on October 27 from his ancestral village of Idupulapaya in Kadapa district to Ichchapuram in Srikakulam district, straddling 3,000 km of the state.
 
 Hours before announcing his decision on the concluding day of the two-day YSRCP plenary here, Jagan mohan Reddy was closeted with master poll strategist  , whose innovative poll planning in the past catapulted India's top politicians, including Na rendra Modi, to power. 
 
 A beaming Jagan introduced Kishor to the party cadre and did not hide his political ambition of ruling  . “Yes, I have a desire to become the CM. I will remain in power for 30 years,“ Jagan said.
 
 This is the first time Prashant, popularly known as PK, is working for a political party south of Vindhyas.Also, this is the first time Jagan will walk for electoral victory in the footsteps of his father.
 
 That the YSRCP leader has immediately adopted the political and electoral strategy devised by Prashant Kishor was apparent from the slew of pre-poll promises Jagan made at the plenary . He announced that YSRCP would introduce total prohibition and monetary benefits to farmers, women and youth if the party was voted to power in 2019.
 
 The Telugu states are famous for padayatra politics.Two senior leaders, YS   and N  , stormed to power after padayatras. And Jagan wants to beat them all by covering the longest distance ever in Telugu states ­ 3,000 km, 200 km more than his bete noire AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.
 
 He said he would stay with the people for six months during the padayatra. His decision to embark on a padayatra will virtually put the state on poll mood, 18 months ahead of the 2009 general elections.
