HYDERABAD: Life will not be easy anymore for  , the 24-year-old American who tried to save two Indian engineers at  ,   in the USA.

 Shot twice by suspect   in his hand and chest, Grillot has suffered injuries and will take a long time to recover, according to his family which has raised $4,73,442 for him. This is much more than the goal of $300,000. Grillot’s sister has now stopped taking donations through the gofundme page created for her recuperating brother. 
 
 For Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s family, a gofundme page created by an ex-colleague and family friend   could collect $6,82,866 against the goal of $1,50,000 .
 
 “Ian is recouping, but still has a long road ahead. Ian made his living working with his hands. We still don't know if full use of his hand will return. Ian has a long road ahead of rehabilitation, possibly additional surgeries, creating a new way of living and providing for himself, not to mention the emotional damage this tragedy has caused. At this point, my mother and I will maintain control of Ian's funding to lessen his stress. His fund will be withdrawn by myself and passed over to him when he is more stable. We thank you all for your continued prayers. Bless you all,” Ian’s sister, Maggie Grillot said on the website page. She had set up the page on February 23 with an appeal for funds for his treatment.
