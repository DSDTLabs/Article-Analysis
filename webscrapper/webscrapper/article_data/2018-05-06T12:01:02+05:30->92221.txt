Love is blind. And love stories are turning out to be a saga of the visionless. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when I heard a technician from You Know Who’s film travelled to Dubai without a visa! The unit of  , starring   and  , was set for its London leg of the shoot and technicians were told about it in advance. The visa applications were made on time, but a certain   didn’t know that he had to appear for a visa interview to be allowed for the trip. We don’t know what airport officials were doing here, but when the team reached Dubai, Mitra, a trolley setter, was detained at the airport and promptly sent back because his visa papers were not in order. I hear, his interview is slated for May 23 and he is well within time for the next film from the production house. The tricky bit is that Mitra was carrying with him some of the lead pair’s clothes and has now come home with all that.
