KOCHI: Sellers of airconditioners seem to be the happiest lot in the city with people wary of intense   thronging consumer durable shops and retail outlets. 

 "From the begining of April we had been experiencing a massive rush . On the first of April we hit a record mark of 113 ACS being sold in a single day," said a sales manager with a popular retail outlet.
 
 The outlet is expecting an increase in sales in the coming days. The price range starts from Rs 18,990. Some brands are also offering installation free as part of the   offer. March and April are the two key months for shops selling airconditioners.
 
 "Although our offer prices start from Rs 27,500 for a normal  , there is a higher demand for inverter ACs due to its greater warranty and power saving capability. We also offer free installation which normally would cost around Rs 1,000. Inverter ACs start from Rs 30,000 and consumers are ready to shell that extra amount for a better quality,'' he said.
 
 Santosh K, a businessman who was looking at different ACs on display at the shop felt that there are not many offers this year. He says, "I came here looking for some high-end brands but sadly they are not available here. I want to change my old AC and is not opting for a new one," he said. 
 
 A father of two kids, Jiby Thomas is on a hunt for the perfect, affordable AC without compromising on the quality as he is worried about the fatigue inducing effects of the heat on his children. He is happy about the many offers available and feels that a comparison of the products available at different shops is necessary to make an intelligent decision.
