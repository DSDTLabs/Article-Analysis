CHENNAI: Number of   from   seeking driving licences or learners’ licences (LLRs) almost doubled in January over the previous month. The reason: The state government scheme offering Rs 25,000 or 50% cost of the two-wheeler, whichever is less, to women aged 18-40 and holding a driving  .

 In January, 1.82 lakh women thronged regional transport offices (RTOs) across the state. Only one lakh women will benefit from the scheme this year. 
 
 In order to handle the excess crowd, all 148 RTOs in Tamil Nadu functioned on Saturday, which is usually a closed day for the office. An officer said RTOs processed more than 10,000 applications on Saturday. “Many of the applicants were working women,” he said.
 
 Monday is the deadline for applying for the scheme, which was an election promise made by the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa ahead of the 2016 elections. 
 
 Following representations, the government temporarily relaxed the eligibility criteria for disabled women, said S Namburajan, a disability rights activist. “These women need not submit a copy of their driving licences or LLRs while applying for the subsidy,” he said. He sought a week’s extension of the deadline.
