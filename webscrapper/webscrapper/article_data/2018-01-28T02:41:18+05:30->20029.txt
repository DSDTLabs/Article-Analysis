GURUGRAM: Two   in Basai have installed CCTV cameras on their premises on their own, in keeping with the administration’s order to step up campus security in the wake of the murder of a Class II student at a Bhondsi school last September.

 While a number of private and state-run schools in the city are crying ‘funds crunch’ and ‘compromising on students’ safety’, Government Senior Secondary School and Government Primary School, both in Basai barely 100 metre away from each other, have shown where there’s a will there’s a way.
 
 The two schools have used their own  , instead of depending on the government, to install three CCTV cameras each. At the senior school, the cameras have been installed near the main entrance and boys’ and girls’ toilets. At the primary school, one camera covers both girls’ and boys’ toilets, one is at the entrance, while the third one keeps vigil over the playground. Besides, the two schools have got police verification done for their non-teaching staff.
 
 Meena Kumari, who acts as principal of both the schools, said, “The six CCTV cameras cost total Rs 40,000, which was sourced from our own children welfare fund.” 
 
 The senior school collects Rs 25 each from Class IX and X students, while those studying in Class XI and XII pay between Rs50 and Rs 100, depending on their streams. “We have been able to save money from those contributions,” said Kumari.
 
 Vinod Kumar, a teacher at the primary school, said, “The students now know they are being watched.” CCTV footage of more than 15 days can be saved for further reference, he added.
