Producer   describes his wife   as a bold director. The underlying theme of her next film,  , proves why. 'With the film's I'm try to point out that 'humans are greater than God'. People would be afraid to make statements like that but I am not. My film touches upon the fact that humans in our life need to be given more importance and treated well to live a happy life, rather than worshipping a God and asking for the same,' says the director who is celebrating her birthday today. 
'I will be busy with post production of Vaisakham. We are planning on releasing it in Tamil so I have to fly to Chennai soon to oversee the dubbing,' she says when asked how she plans to spend her birthday.
 Asked what her expectations from this project are she says, 'I feel every person who will watch this movie will have tears in their eyes. They will realise the regrets that they never addressed through this film.'
  Vaisakham directed by B Jaya is being produced by BA Raju under RJ Cinemas banner.
