 On September 11, Dheeraj was taking the gang members to Delhi for another round of robberies when they picked up a fight, while drinking liquor. When the gang members boarded the SUV, Dheeraj was slumping on the cleaner seat. Taking advantage of the situation, the gang members stabbed him to death and threw his body on the roadside.
