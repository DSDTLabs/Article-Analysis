HYDERABAD: Finding fault with the authorities for starting fresh recruitment without carrying forward the unfilled posts meant for physically-challenged persons, Justice M S   of the   on Friday stayed the declaration of results of Teachers Recruitment Test (TRT) in   and erstwhile   district.

 The restraint order is applicable to posts that are defined as secondary grade teachers. The results for the posts of school assistants can be declared. The posts that were carried forward will be exclusively earmarked for the specified category.
 
 The judge, however, refused to stay the written examination and other process. He was dealing with two separate cases filed by S   and D Mallikarjun from Warangal complaining that the teacher vacancies in the physically disabled category were not fully filled in the previous recruitment in 2012. The authorities were asked to file counter affidavits explaining the issues raised by the petitioners.
