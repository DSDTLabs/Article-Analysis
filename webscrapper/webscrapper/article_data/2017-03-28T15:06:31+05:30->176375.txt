WASHINGTON: US President Donald   phoned PM Narendra Modi and congratulated him on BJP 
  , White House press secretary Sean Spicer revealed on Monday, promising a more detailed readout later in the day on the conversation.This is said to be the third 
  between the two leaders since Trump's election victory on November 8, 2016.

 The two leaders have invited each other to visit their respective countries, and the UP felicitation appears to be just a cover for a more substantive conversation involving an upcoming personal meeting. India's foreign secretary 
  and National Security Advisor 
  have made back-to-back visits to Washington DC, with New Delhi appearing keen not to let the momentum of ties built up during the administrations of George Bush and Barack Obama flag.
 
 Officials who have briefed journalists on the meetings have said the Trump administration appears well-inclined towards India and they detect no hiccups in what has been a steady ramping up of ties.
 
 But there is an element of caution in their approach, particularly with regards to high-level visits, as they try and assess the players and outlook of an administration that has had a rocky start in Washington DC, including with respect to foreign visits.
 
 New Delhi prefers a carefully choreographed visit where the optics will reflect well on its leader, now flush with a massive electoral victory , whereas the Trump administration is all business.
