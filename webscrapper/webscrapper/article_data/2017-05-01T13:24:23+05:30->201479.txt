WARANGAL: AICC general secretary   on Sunday accused chief minister   of completely neglecting the farmers in Telangana.

 Addressing a massive public meeting at Mulkanoor in Husnabad assembly constituency, Digvijay Singh condemned the   at   and alleged that the TRS government was implicating innocent farmers in fake cases for holding protests over not getting remunerative prices for their produce. He said the state government had made no arrangements for procurement of chilli and other crops, leaving farmers to their fate.
 
 Digvijaya Singh said both KCR and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have excelled in making fake promises. They show several dreams to the people and then shatter them, he said. He said that the Congress fought for the country's independence and brought a democratic country. However, Narendra Modi is claiming that during the last three years he had achieved what Congress had failed to achieve during the last 70 years. He said it was the Congress which developed huge infrastructure in the country during its rule and now Modi is trying to take credit for everything.
 
  criticised KCR for not responding to the problems being faced by farmers. He said that the CM was not ready to even acknowledge that thousands of farmers were in distress over not getting remunerative prices for their produce.
