Chandigarh: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has opposed the Congress government’s move to withdraw electricity concession given to scheduled castes and economically weak consumers.

 AAP leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira has written to chief minister Amarinder Singh requesting him to withdraw the instructions issued by the Punjab government about free electricity to scheduled caste, backward classes and non-SC BPL domestic consumers.
 
 Khaira said that as per Punjab government’s earlier instructions, subsidy on account of free electricity supply up to 200 units per month was being provided to the beneficiaries but as per the new instruction issued on 17 October, 2017, that came into effect from November 1, 2017, the government has imposed limits of connected load of 1 KW and consumption not exceeding 3,000 units per annum as eligibility for availing this subsidized supply of electricity.
 
 He said that the limit of 1KW connected load was low and would render more than 50% poor and needy families disqualified for this subsidy. “Imposing such limits will not only defeat the purpose of helping deprived section but will also give space for instances of exploitation in event of errors in energy meters,” he added.
 
 He said that the government is trying to fetch money being spent on its avoidable expenses like crores of being paid to ministers and advisers, from the pockets of poor and needy people of the state.
 
 Khaira said that the Congress before assembly elections had announced to provide more facilities to the poor and needy people but has started withdrawing the facilities already given to these families. He demanded that the limit of connected load may be enhanced to 3 KW and for 200 units per month concession and the extra units may be charged as per tariff if situation demands. The condition of 3,000 units per annum must be withdrawn, he added.
