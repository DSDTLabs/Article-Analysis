The Punjabi   Ammy Virk who has been making headlines for his upcoming biopic ‘Harjeeta’, is yet again turning heads. This time it is his chiseled abs that are to be blamed. Ammy took to his Facebook account to share a picture of his sexy abs and shush all with his hot bod.

  
  
 This is not the first time the actor-singer has posted the picture of his ripped midriff complemented with those abs. Just before the trailer of ‘Harjeeta’ was released he had shared a post-workout picture of self.
 
  
  The game of flaunting off doesn’t end there. The below-posted picture is the proof of same.
  
  
 All these pictures conclude that   has really poured his blood, sweat and tear to achieve this transformation. Since he is playing the lead in the movie based on the journey of Indian Hockey player  , the role demanded him to look way younger than his age. Ammy took the tough call and trained to get into the shape. His hard work partially paid off when the movie poster showed his uncanny resemblance to Harjeet Singh Tuli. The remaining reward will only be estimated once the movie reaches the silver screen on  , 2018.
