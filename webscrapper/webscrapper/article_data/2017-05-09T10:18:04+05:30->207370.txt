The first look poster of Nee Ko Nja Cha director Gireesh Mano’s   has its actors   and   in sheriff attires riding a horse, and its director tells us that the comic strip look was exactly what they were going for.

 “We wanted to establish what kind of film Lava Kusha is. It’s a fun entertainer, a spy comedy in fact. It’s a genre that we have not seen much in Malayalam and the entire story is told with so much fun and humour, just like what the first look poster represents,” says Gireesh.
 
 The director will know best how much impact a first look poster will have on the film, especially how his debut movie Nee Ko Nja Cha got push it required from its quirky title and posters at a time when its actors were all a host of newcomers.
 
 Lava Kusha, meanwhile, has an established cast with Neeraj and Aju playing the leads along with Biju Menon. Deepti Sathi will be seen in a pivotal role in the movie, which is scheduled for a July release.
