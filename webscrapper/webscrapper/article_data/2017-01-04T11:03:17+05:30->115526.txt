LUCKNOW: The original trigger of the   family feud is now a key negotiator between the warring factions. Gayatri Prasad  , once dropped from chief minister   Yadav’s cabinet on charges of graft and for prompting SP patriarch   to “threaten” an IPS officer, has come a long way in earning the trust of the Yadav first family.

 Having skipped Sunday’s convention where Akhilesh was declared the SP chief, Gayatri remained by   all through Monday morning and accompanied him to the airport from where the SP chief took a flight to Delhi. In the evening, Gayatri met the chief minister reportedly to persuade him to find an end to the ongoing bitter battle for supremacy within the Yadav clan. On Tuesday, he was perhaps the only politician at MSY’s residence when the three-hour-long meeting between Mulayam and Akhilesh was underway. 
 
 Shivpal joined the father-son duo during the meeting and his loyalist Narad Rai, who was dropped from the cabinet along with Shivpal, also reached Mulayam’s residence. While Rai left with Shivpal after the meeting ended, Gayatri stayed back till late in the evening. 
 
 In September, Amethi MLA Prajapati had earned the wrath of the CM for bringing disrepute to Mulayam and the SP government. Two weeks later, however, upon the insistence of uncle Shivpal, and on Mulayam’s own instructions, Prajapati made a cheeky comeback into Akhilesh’s council of ministers.
 
 Prajapati’s return, however, triggered a deeper political crisis in the SP, especially considering it was part of MSY’s compromise formula to douse the sparks in the Yadav clan.
