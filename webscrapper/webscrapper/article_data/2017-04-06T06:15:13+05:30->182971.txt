HYDERABAD: The next time you step out to watch a movie at a multiplex and feel you are being fleeced at the parking lot, the police may not be able to help you. 

 On March 8, it was reported in these columns that people are charged different rates for parking vehicles in the city malls and shopping complexes. Later, activist Vijay Gopal had filed an   to find out the role of cops in case of parking disputes.
 
 The activist had previously filed a complaint in the   police station, asking them to issue an FIR against a theatre in Abids for charging exorbitant amounts for parking. 
 
 "I would like to know if any FIR has been issued in the complaint made on February 16. It is a cognizable offence, have any arrests been made?," Gopal had asked in the RTI filed by him. Surprisingly, the reply given by the police in this case was a simple, 'No'. 
 
 "The police is refusing to file a complaint or register an FIR in a clear case of cheating. What does the common man do?" he questioned. He also went on to specify that the Cinema Regulation Act of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 1955, is clear about rules. 
 
 Parking is permitted if there is ample space and only a nominal price is levied for keeping vigil on parked vehicles. "But some commercial complexes are charging even 100, which is unacceptable," he says. 
 
 According to officials from the   (GHMC), the managements of theatres are meant to provide   for free. Despite the norms, theatre managements slap arbitrary parking charges on visitors. 
 
 "There is no specific department that controls parking fee either in theatres or multiplexes in the city. While the government is supposed to fix a rate and issue it to managements of the complexes, it has failed to do so,"  , general manager,  , told TOI.
