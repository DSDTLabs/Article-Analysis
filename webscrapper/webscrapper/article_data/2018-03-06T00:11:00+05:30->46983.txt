Pune: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has withdrawn its   and thunderstorms warning for Madhya Maharashtra and the Vidarbha region, though towards the end of the week, isolated rainfall is expected in both the regions.

 On Sunday, the IMD had predicted that hail and thunderstorms may lash Madhya Maharashtra on March 7 and Vidarbha on March 8. However, on Monday evening, the Met department issued an updated forecast, which warned of thunderstorm accompanied by gusty winds only in parts of northeast India. Some of the country, including Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha, may still see isolated rainfall activity on March 8 and 9, the update said.
 
 “Though we had earlier predicted hailstorm activity over parts of Maharashtra, the weather system (western disturbance) that was expected to partly cause the hailstorm activity has now changed course. It has shifted to the eastern parts of the country,” a Met official said.
 
 Meanwhile, sources at Skymet Weather Services said rains are likely in Nagpur, Washim and Akola on March 9. They said while the rains may bring some respite from the existing hot weather conditions, the relief could be short-lived as the mercury is expected to go up again.
 
 Temperatures have been above normal in most parts of the state. In Pune, due to clear skies, there might be a slight dip in the night temperature from Tuesday. The maximum temperature is likely to rise again to 35° celsius.
