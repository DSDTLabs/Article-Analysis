KOCHI: Two   of   were on Friday   for 14 days. 

 Sunil   alias   and Vigeesh were in police custody for 15 days, which ended on Friday.
 
 They were produced before the judicial first class magistrate court, and the prosecution did not seek an extended police custody.
 
 The defence counsel, meanwhile, filed a bail plea, which would be taken up for hearing on Monday.
 
 "They were in police custody for the maximum period of 15 days, and it cannot be further extended," said a source close to the public prosecutor's office.
 
 Meanwhile, it was learnt that forensic reports have been submitted before the court, and it would be considered in the open court during trial.
 
 A copy each of the forensic report has been sent to the investigating officer and the magistrate. The copy sent to the court will remain in the sealed until the trial stage, sources said.
 
 The main accused, Suni, had given a statement that he had copied the visuals of the crime into a memory card, which was used in a mobile phone. He had later handed over the phone to his former lawyer, who presented it to the court.
 
 The investigators were still unable to find another mobile phone Suni had used, even as the accused maintained that he had tossed it into the backwaters in Kochi.
 
 The police's request for a polygraph test on the accused was rejected after Suni refused undergo it citing mental and physical issues.
 
 Though the accused were in police custody for 15 days, the investigators were yet to find any quotation-or contract-angle. Police were now verifying if Suni mentioned the 'quotation' to the survivor in a bid to mislead her.
