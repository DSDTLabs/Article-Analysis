ITTA BENA, Mississippi: A military transport plane crashed on Monday in  's Delta region, killing at least 12 people aboard, officials said.

  Sheriff Ricky Banks said officials have found 12 bodies so far. Banks said that officials are searching for others across a large debris field, more than five hours after the KC-130 refueling tanker spiraled to the ground into a soybean field about 85 miles (135 kilometers) north of Jackson.
 
  spokeswoman Capt   said in a statement that a Marine KC-130 "experienced a mishap" on Monday evening but provided no further details.
 
 Aerial pictures taken by WLBT-TV showed the skeleton of the plane burning strongly, producing plumes of black smoke visible for miles across the flat landscape of the delta.
 
 Austin Jones, who owns a neighboring farm, said the fire continued after sunset.
 
 Jones said his son watched the plane go down while working on the farm and said it was smoking as it descended.
 
 Officials did not release information on what caused the crash or where the flight originated.
