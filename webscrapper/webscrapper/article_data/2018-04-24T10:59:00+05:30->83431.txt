The change of guard in   (VHP) has brought the spotlight back on the   case. The new international president, Justice (retired) Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje , tells Pankaj Shah that the legal course notwithstanding,   has been, is, and will continue to be in ‘agitation mode’ till a grand Ram Temple is constructed in Ayodhya. In moving motion against CJI, opposition’s idea is to impeach entire judiciary, defame it and to put pressure on it, he says

 
 
 • The matter is sub-judice. We will cross the bridge as and when it comes. We are waiting for the judgment which is likely within six months. If it comes, and is in our favour, then there will be no hurdle in the construction of temple. If it’s against us, then we will sit together and decide what can be done. We will consult seers and masses, accordingly. We have been, are, and will be in agitation mode till the Ram Temple is constructed at the place where   was born.
 
 
 
 • Among all the governments till now, the BJP-led NDA is creating least hurdles for Hindus. VHP too is a democratic body. It will take into account all opinion before deciding the future course of action. For that, we should know about the factual position today. And so, whenever the   order comes, we will work accordingly.
 
 
 
 • We would not like to comment on any former VHP leader. All I can say is that there has been no change in the agenda of VHP since the time of former president Ashok Singhal during whose tenure Ram Temple movement hit its peak. VHP has always been and is propagating the idea of construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. That is still going on. It has not changed.
 
 
 
 • If you ask me as an ex-judge, I’ll say it seems to be a political gimmick. Because they don’t have even 100 MPs in Lok Sabha. How are they going to pass the motion with 2/3rd majority? It means their idea is not to impeach CJI. Their idea is to impeach the entire judiciary, defame it and to put pressure on it as the Ram Temple issue comes up for hearing in Supreme Court. As an exjudge, I can tell you it is depreciable.
 
 
 
 • Creating a large public perception on the issue is at the core of the movement. That can be done only through an ‘ideological revolution’. We are a transparent organization. There is no hidden agenda. Whatever we will do, we will do it publicly. And therefore there is no question of anything which is not known to public. We are all for construction of the Ram temple. We have been trying for it and we are still trying for it.
 
 
 
 • You see how many people from all over India are visiting Ram Lalla. Are they coming for their own purpose? No. They all want a temple here. This is a question of faith. It is an article of faith for every Hindu.
 
 
 
 • It is a big issue. There is no other religion as secular as Hinduism. We are the most tolerant. We do not discriminate.
