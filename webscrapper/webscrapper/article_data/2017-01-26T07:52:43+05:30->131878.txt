Girish Bharadwaj, 66, has been   into people's heart by giving a boost to rural connectivity with his suspension skywalks.
Bharadwaj, a mechanical engineer from Mandya's  , has already built over 100 bridges. He is busy building a 135-metre long bridge at present, his 128th, in Dongri, Ankola taluk of Uttara Kannada. His last bridge came up in Mangaluru's Kuppepadavu.
 
 Bharadwaj has built bridges across Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. They cost   and takes about three months compared to three years for a conventional bridge.
 
 He built his100th bridge in Mandekolu, Sullia, near former CM DV Sadananda Gowda's house. “It was sheer coin cidence that I completed the bridge when he became the CM and I was fortunate enough to see it being inaugurated during his first visit to the district,“ said 'Vishwesharaya of Sullia', the name given to him by the villagers who have benefited from his work.
 
 “In hindsight, I think my father's blessings `may you not succeed in your interviews when you go with your begging bowl' (first class engineering degree) was responsible for changing my life. If I had pur sued my dream, I would be lost somewhere. Now, I find happiness in this pursuit. The im mense love and affection I have got from people is an added bonus,“ says Bharadwaj, who belongs to Dakshina Kanna da's Sullia taluk.
