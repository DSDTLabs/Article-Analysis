Salem: A city hospital has successfully performed multifocal glued intraocular lenses (IOL) implantation surgery on a 60-year-old patient recently. According to the hospital management, this was the first such surgery in a city hospital.

 IOL surgery is performed to replace natural lenses with artificial IOL in cataract patients. Glued IOL is a new surgical technique for implantation.
 
 The patient, who had undergone cataract surgery in the right eye about 20 years ago, approached Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital with dislocated IOL. 
 
 “The patient had a dislocated IOL in the vitreous cavity of the right eye with visual acuity of 2/60. The left eye had normal 6/6 vision. It was a challenging task for us as we could not have expected promising results with the usual glued IOL surgery,” said medical director of the hospital Dr E Karpagavalli at a media conference on Saturday.
 
 “Multifocal glued IOL surgery is a high-risk procedure as we have to go near the retina to take out the dislocated IOL. The chances of retinal detachment and infection are high. However, we managed to perform it successfully,” she added.
 
 The surgery was performed by ophthalmologist D Rakesh Seenappa and his team. He said the patient had a clear vision and was able to carry on with his daily activities in the first week of surgery itself.
