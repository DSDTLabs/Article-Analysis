Ariyalur: In a self-criticism of sorts, an AIADMK MLA has advised students and parents not to believe any politician who claims that Tamil Nadu would be exempted from the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) for MBBS admissions. The belated realisation came from Kunnam MLA R T Ramachandran at the foundation stone laying function for constructing a public library in memory of S Anitha, the medical aspirant who committed suicide as she could not clear NEET. 

 “NEET will certainly be held and the examination would not be exempted for anyone. Do not believe the statements made by politicians — including me — if they claim so,” he said. Though the Supreme Court had made it clear that NEET would be the common examination for MBBS selections nationwide, political parties in the state had been vociferously demanding that the state secure an exemption for its medical aspirants who were not used to writing entrance tests. 
 
 The stone-laying function was organised by the family members of the 17-year-old dalit girl who ended her life on September 1 last year. 
 
 The public library would be built at her village, Kuzhumur in Ariyalur district. Ramachandran also handed over a cheque of Rs 2 lakh as donation for its construction. Kunnam’s former DMK MLA S S Sivasankar also participated in the event. Actor Raghava Lawrence said that he would sponsor the entire cost of constructing the library. 
 
 He appealed to the people to cast their votes for those who provided good education and healthcare for free, and not for those who doled out freebies. Earlier, Anitha’s brother S Manirathinam said that they would spend Rs 15 lakh to construct the public library in memory of Anitha, for the benefit of weaker sections of the society.
