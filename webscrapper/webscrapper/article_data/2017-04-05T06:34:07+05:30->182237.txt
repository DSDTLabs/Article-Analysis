BENAGLURU: The ongoing tussle between truck owners' associations and   (IRDA) continued on Tuesday, resulting in disruption of commodities' supply. 

 While fruits and vegetables have already become scarce, the supply of petrol, diesel and LPG is also set to be affected, with related associations extending their support to the protest. Some petrol bunks in Indiranagar told customers on Tuesday they were out of stock. 
 
 Truckers are opposing the sharp increase in third-party insurance premium. Members of the   (SIMTA) said over 2 lakh trucks haven't moved out of parking lots since April 1 in Bengaluru alone. The number includes 50,000 trucks which supply goods to   and 25,000 parked at the Devaraj Urs terminal. 
 
  The Yeshwantpur APMC which remained shut on Monday saw very little business on Tuesday, the sixth day of the strike. "Only a small quantity of potatoes and onions were unloaded," said   Lahoti, president, Bangalore Wholesale Food Grains and Pulses Merchants' Association. 
 
  Lahoti said though three-wheelers would start making deliveries across the city after 5pm on Tuesday, it wouldn't amount to even 1% of the total transactions.
