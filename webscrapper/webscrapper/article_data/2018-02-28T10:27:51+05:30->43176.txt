As secretaries, who visited districts, made a number of recommendations for better implementation of schemes like   (free distribution of medicines) and old-age pension schemes, Naveen asked departments to look into the recommendations. 
 
 He also emphasised on effective implementation of schemes meant for children, women, old age persons and construction labourers.
