KOLKATA: A tenant who got involved in an argument with his 58-year-old landlord allegedly stabbed him twice in the neck and chest on Wednesday morning. Victim   Shaw’s wife  , 42, tried to intervene and was also stabbed multiple times. 

 The incident was reported from the Deodar Street- Garcha Road crossing in Ballygunge around 9am. Accused   fled the spot but was arrested after a two-hour manhunt conducted by special police teams. The two victims are now fighting for their lives at a private hospital on EM Bypass. Though inappropriate behaviour by the tenant may be the reason behind the argument, cops believe a conspiracy to usurp the property also needed to be probed.
 
 According to Pooja, the victims’ daughter-in-law, Satish had moved into 20/1   as a tenant of his nephew Pintu. When the family property was divided,   was allotted a house at Hazra and Bhola was allotted the Deodar Street residence. 
 
 “We had been complaining about Satish and his ways. He threw parties where his friends would behave indecently. We had served an eviction notice, but he challenged it and the matter is under litigation. On Wednesday, my in-laws went to ask him to lower the volume of music and restrict the entry of unknown people when an argument started. The accused suddenly brought out a sharp weapon and attacked them. I heard their cries and rushed up from the first floor to the third floor,” The cops said they will also question other relatives of the  , including Pintu. 
 
 A case under attempt-to-murder has been registered at the Ballygunge police station and a forensic team visited the spot to collect evidence. A search was on for the weapon.
