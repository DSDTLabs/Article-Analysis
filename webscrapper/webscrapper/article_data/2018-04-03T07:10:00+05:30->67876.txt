GREATER NOIDA: A manager of a private bank beat his mother to death with an iron rod and attacked his two younger brothers in   of Jarcha on Monday, apparently unhappy over repeated demands by his brothers for division of property.

 Ajit Singh, the eldest of three brothers and an MBA, changed his clothes and left home in his car as neighbours alerted by screams of help gathered around. He was arrested in the evening.
 
 Family members said Ajit (27), a manager at private bank in Noida, first attacked his mother Shakuntala and youngest brother Pushpendra, who were asleep in one room, around 5.30am. He allegedly hit both of them multiple times with an iron rod before moving to the adjacent room. 
 
 After a few knocks on the door, Ajit reportedly asked Pooja, wife of the second brother, Ratindra, to send her husband to the courtyard as he wanted to talk to him. “Ratindra came out of the room and went to the bathroom. As soon as he had come out, Ajit attacked him with the rod,” a relative said. Others got to know about the attack around 6am, when Ratindra’s wife screamed seeing her husband being beaten up by Ajit.
 
 “As neighbours gathered, they saw Ratindra writhing in pain and bleeding. Ajit told them he had attacked his mother and youngest brother as well and they were in the room,” Gaurav said. The villagers rushed to the room and found Shakuntala and Pushpendra lying on the blood-stained floor and a bedsheet covering them.
 
 They were rushed to NTPC hospital. While Shakuntala died on the way, Pushpendra was shifted to AIIMS in Delhi, where his condition was said to be serious. While some villagers claimed the family was in deep in debt, relatives insisted that Ajit was averse to his brothers’ demands of division of their property.
 
 Shailendra Pratap Singh, SHO of Jarcha police station, said an FIR had been lodged against Ajit under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC.
