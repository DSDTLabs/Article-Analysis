BHOPAL: A couple of days after a youth stabbed a cab driver, a man fired three bullets at a youth while suspecting that he had punctured his car in Shahjahanabad area here on Monday.

 However, the bullet missed its target and the youth, Asim Khan, is safe. The incident took place at   road of the city around 1.30 am on Monday. Police have registered a case and launched a manhunt to arrest the accused who are at large. “Accused identified as Bilal, 35, and Khalid Qureshi, 40, own a marriage hall named Mussa marriage hall at Noor Mahal road and live nearby. Both park their vehicles outside a residential apartment named  , situated opposite to their marriage hall,” investigating officer Ashok Upadhya told TOI.
 
 It all started when Bilal came out and found his car’s tyre punctured. Enraged over it, he picked up a fight with Asim Khan, an auto-parts shop owner, who lives in Delta Homes, said police. “Soon Bilal started beating Asim and sought his elder brother Khalid’s help. Khalid rushed to his terrace and fired three rounds at Asim, though he missed the target,” Upadhya said. The bullets hit another car parked near the spot, he said.
 
 The sound of the gunshots was so loud that people from neighbourhood came out of their homes. Both the accused fled the spot. “A team of forensic experts reached the spot and recovered two bullets, one from the car and another from the terrace from where Khalid fired at Asim,” said police. “Prima facie it seems that the bullets were fired from a 315 bore gun. Investigations revealed that Khalid owns a licensed gun, though it will be clear once the accused are arrested,” Upadhya said.
 
 Earlier, an Uber cab driver was stabbed to death in Berkheda Pathani area of the city. The deceased, identified as Yogesh Pujari, 24, had an altercation with a teenager, Ashwini, after which the latter allegedly killed him.
