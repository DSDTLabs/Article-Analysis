NEW DELHI: Police filed a case of cruelty to animals after a Gray langur’s body was found stuffed in a gunny bag in a forested area of Vasant Kunj. Locals said the animal likely died of harsh weather as it had been tied to a tree outside a house to keep monkeys away. After the animal died, it was probably stuffed in the bag and dumped, police said.

 Fauna Police, a Wildlife  , found the dead langur. A senior police officer said a case under Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle, of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) of IPC and Section 11 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, was registered at Vasant Kunj (north) police station and investigations were on. “We are looking into allegations that the   was trafficked by two men,” the official said. 
 
 Abhinav Srihan, managing trustee of the NGO, said as per the wildlife protection Act, langurs were Schedule-II protected wildlife species. Srihan said a former colleague informed him that a langur had died in a house in Vasant Kunj. “I was told that the animal was tied to a tree by Pradeep, the house owner. When we questioned him, Pradeep told us that the langur had died after he got tangled in the branches. He then packed the dead langur in a gunny bag and dumped it in the jungle.” 
 
 The two alleged traffickers also had a visiting card wherein they claimed to provide langurs for protection of schools, colleges, offices and other places from monkeys. Cops said they were looking into these claims.
