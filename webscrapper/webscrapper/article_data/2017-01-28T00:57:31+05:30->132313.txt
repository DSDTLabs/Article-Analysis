 Coimbatore: As many as 190 members of MDMK were detained on Friday for attempting to stage a   to condemn the Kerala government for its move to construct a check dam across Bhavani River.
 
 The protesters, led by former MDMK MP A Ganeshamurthy, gathered in front of the Coimbatore railway junction and attempted to enter the railway junction to stage a rail roko. However, the city police stopped and arrested the protesters. Ganeshamurthy said over 3.5 lakh acres of agricultural land gets water for irrigation from Bhavani River and the city is also dependent on the river for drinking purpose. Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode district farmers depend on the river. Now, the Kerala government is attempting to construct a check dam across Bhavani. If the construction work is over, then these three districts will face drought conditions.
 
 “The Union government should intervene and stop the check dam construction work in Kerala. If central government fails to take any action, we will intensify our protest,” said Ganeshamurthy. The protesters were kept in a marriage hall for a while and later released.
