Jaisalmer: On April 13 two minor Hindu girls and a 16-year-old Muslim boy had committed suicide by hanging themselves from a tree at Sarupe ka Tala in Barmer district. Now after a month the girlsâ€™ family has demanded a probe again, claiming it to be a case of rape and murder. 

 They alleged that police have forged their statements and closed the case without proper investigation. 
 
 Father of the girls met Barmer SP Gagandeep Singla and requested him to change the investigation officer so the case has now been handed over to additional SP Rameshwar Meghwal. The family alleged that atrocities on Dalits have increased in their village.
 
 Singla said investigation was done and prima facie it appears to be a suicide case and post-mortem report also states the same. With regards to Dalit atrocities he said no such incidents have come to light and no complaints have been received.
