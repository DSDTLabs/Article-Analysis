Chandigarh/Mohali/Panchkula: The Bharat   called by Dalit organisations hit life in the Tricity on Monday, causing traffic jams, blocking Internet and shutting schools.

 Transport services were hit in Mohali. With Internet-based radio cabs remaining off roads, people found it difficult to reach their destinations. There was no Internet connectivity in Mohali, as people could not connect with each other on WhatsApp and through SMSes.
 
 Schools in Mohali were closed as a precautionary measure and some of the trains originating and culminating at Chandigarh and Mohali were also cancelled.
 
 The bandh caused major traffic snarls in Chandigarh and Panchkula as commuters were seen stranded on roads waiting for the protests to end. The traffic situation in Derabassi, Zirakpur and Lalru was worse as serpentine queues of vehicles could be seen on the national highway. Vehicles were lined up to Hallomajra point in Chandigarh. Traffic jams were also witnessed at the Industrial Area-Sector 29 roundabout, Piccadilly roundabout, housing board light point and some points on Madhya Marg in Chandigarh.
 
 The   organisations also forced closure of shops in various markets.
