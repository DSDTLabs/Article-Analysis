KOLKATA: Five staffers of a   in Howrah were arrested on Saturday evening after they allegedly refused to allow a   judge’s vehicle to pass through the gate meant for cars exempt from paying toll.

 Witnesses said the toll plaza staff stopped Justice Biswanath Somadder’s car as it was returning to the city. The judge’s driver told the toll collectors that it was a judge’s car and asked them to let it pass.
 
 There was a heated exchange of words, following which Justice Somadder tried to intervene. But he, too, faced the same “inappropriate behaviour”. Witnesses said he got off the car and tried to reason with them, showing them the National Flag on the car’s bonnet and pointing to his personal security officer (PSO), but to no avail.
 
 Justice Samadder’s PSO then called   police station officials, who came and arrested the five staffers for preventing a “public servant from discharging his duties”.
 
 The incident happened on the Bally end of the Second Vivekananda Setu. 
 
 “An unfortunate incident happened on Saturday evening. Action is being taken according to law,” Howrah (North) assistant commissioner of police Rahul Roy said.
