CHENNAI: Mumbai's 'crisis man'   has delivered again. The 25-year-old batsman's 125-ball 129, laced with 11 fours and four sixes, powered Mumbai to a 41-run win over Gujarat in their second round   match at the SSN College ground here on Tuesday.

 
 The right-hander walked in early at No 3 after the dismissal of opener Jay Bista. By the time he perished in the 46th over, he had well and truly put Mumbai in command with the support of skipper   (51).
 
 A couple of half-centuries from Gujarat skipper Priyank Panchal (89) and No 4 Bharghav Merai (64) did keep Gujarat in the hunt for a while in a stiff chase of 318. However, the combined efforts of the Mumbai pacers Royston Dias (4/64),   (2/29) and Shivam Malhotra (2/48) ensured Gujarat were bowled out for 276 in 47.4 overs.
 
 Despite scoring 652 runs in seven Ranji matches at an average of 59.27, putting up impressive performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 and earning the 'crisis man' tag, a grounded Lad said that he is going through a "pretty decent" season. "I'm having a pretty decent season this year. I'm just trying to keep things normal. The 'crisis man' tag puts a lot of responsibility on my shoulders. A lot of things are expected from me and I'm just trying to do the best for my team," Lad told TOI after registering second List A hundred.
 
 
 
 
 An inexperienced Goa side stunned defending champions Tamil Nadu by four wickets in their Vijay Hazare Trophy clash here at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday. Goa's rookie spinners, on a sluggish wicket, scripted a dramatic turnaround in the first half as they dismissed TN's last seven wickets for 44 runs and restricted them to 210. In the latter half, veteran Goa batsman   (103) guided his team through.
