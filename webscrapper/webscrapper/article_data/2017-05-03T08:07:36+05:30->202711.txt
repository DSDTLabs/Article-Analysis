VADODARA: A consumer court in the city ordered the Employee’s State   Corporation (ESIC) to pay Rs 65,000 to a citizen, who suffered a heart attack during his job in 2007, towards his treatment cost along with interest and litigation charges.

 Nitin Vyas, a labourer working at Dinesh Mills, suffered an attack while he was at work in December 2007. Vyas was rushed to   in Gotri. However, since the hospital did not have proper facilities to treat him, he was shifted to a private cardiac hospital where an angioplasty was conducted on him.
 
 After he was discharged, Vyas applied to ESIC to claim Rs 1.09 lakh which were borne by him for treatment. However, he was paid only Rs 44,000. 
 
 He then complained to the consumer court against ESIC in-charge officer.
 
 In the court, ESIC defended itself saying that since Vyas did not take treatment at Ahmedabad-based U   or  , which are recognized by them, and instead went to a private hospital for treatment, they are not entitled to pay the remaining amount to Vyas. 
 
 In reply, Vyas’s lawyer M S Pandya argued that it was not practical for him to go to Ahmedabad for treatment at such a critical stage.
 
 The court too upheld Pandya’s argument and said that hospitals having modern facilities should be recognized by ESIC so that those paying premium can get proper treatment.
