KOCHI: The state police chief has informed the high court that steps have been taken to ensure adequate police assistance and protection for the smooth functioning of   like Uber and Ola at airports, railway stations, and bus stations in Kerala. 

 The police chief's submission was in response to a contempt of court petition filed by Navas C of Ponnani in Malappuram alleging police inaction. Considering a petition filed by Navas, the high court had ordered on March 17 that obstruction of online taxi services by other taxi and autorickshaw drivers infringes the constitutional right to practise any occupation, trade, or business.
 
 In an affidavit filed to the court, state police chief Loknath Behera said strict directions were issued on March 19 by him asking inspector generals of all ranges in the state to take action and that district police chiefs have reported back that adequate assistance and protection is being provided for the smooth conduct of online taxi services at airports, railway stations, and bus stations across the state. The affidavit also said a total of 30 cases have been registered in incidents related to prevention of online taxi services across the state during 2015 and 2016.
 
 Through the directions issues on March 19, the inspector generals have been asked to deal firmly with incidents of hooliganism. The inspector generals have also been warned that if any such incidents occur again due to non-attention of police, they will be held personally responsible, the police chief's affidavit said. A majority of the attacks against online taxi operators occurred in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, with 10 cases reported from Kochi and 17 from Thiruvananthapuram, the court was informed.
 
 The state police chief's affidavit also said a joint effort, which also involves local self-government bodies, revenue, transport, KSRTC, railways, airport authority, and RTAs, is required to resolve the issues between online taxi services and traditional auto-taxi drivers.
