The Congress and NCP on Tuesday asked   to quit the BJP-led government and then talk of contesting the 2019 elections independently. 

 "Sena will never quit power. Uddhav Thackeray should first ask his ministers in Maharashtra and in the NDA government to quit," said NCP leader Ajit Pawar. 
 
 Leader of the opposition in the assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, "Uddhav lack guts. We welcome his decision, but before that he must quit the government."
 
 "The Sena should have quit over the state's failure to waive loans, but it surrendered before the CM," he said.
