Nagpur: A 50-year-old man has gone missing along with his family from his home after allegedly raping a 4-year-old girl. The matter came to light when survivor fell sick and she was taken to the private hospital where doctors examining her found injuries and swelling around her private parts.  An offence of rape has been registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, at Kotwali police station against Prashant Napade, who works in a cooperative society, following a complaint by survivor’s parents on Sunday. Medical examination of the survivor was conducted at the government medical college and hospital. The survivor, a student of nursery, was playing in the courtyard of her place in the afternoon on Wednesday. She went to accused’s place to pluck flowers. Napade, who was alone at the time, invited her in the kitchen on the pretext of giving more flowers. He performed unnatural sex with her. As she couldn’t tolerate the pain, he allowed her to go back.  In the evening, survivor fell sick and was given some medicines at home. However, when her mother, a housewife, found she wasn’t recovering, she took her to a private hospital on Friday when doctors told her about sexual assault the girl had suffered. Woman informed her husband, an electrician, who couldn’t believe it as the family of accused was their neighbours since two decades and the accused, who has no children, has been seeing his daughter since her birth. “On Saturday, the complainant went to accused place and asked him whether he had committed the crime. Though Napade denied the charge, the girl pointed at him as one who had hurt her,” PSI MK Harde told TOI. A heated argument ensued between the families that attracted other neighbours. The accused, who was staying with his wife, a teacher, and his mother, then fled from the place after the tiff. Cops are on the lookout for him.
