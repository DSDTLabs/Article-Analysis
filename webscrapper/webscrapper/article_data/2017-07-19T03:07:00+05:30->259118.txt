Panaji: The Panaji KTC bus depot has found itself in another sticky situation when the staff manning the pay-toilet facilities were found overcharging customers on Tuesday.  Five school girls were denied access to the facility for not adhering to the informal rates being charged by the staff. The charges for the pay-toilet services are Re 1 for urinals, Rs 5 for toilets and Rs 10 for bathing. The prices are clearly marked on a signboard installed above the payment counter. However, the staff managing the service has been extorting Rs 5 for urinals, Rs 10 for toilets and Rs 20 for bathing. While locals use the service for urinals and toilets, tourists usually avail the service for bathing. Following this incident, the Goa Consumer Action Network (GoaCAN) filed a complaint with KTC authorities demanding immediate action against the private contractor and his staff managing the service.  KTCL depot manager Anil Vengurlekar has instructed a lady staff member to keep strict vigil on the payment operations for the next eight days. The contractor has also been instructed to hire female staff to communicate accurate rates to women users. The issue of overcharging has persistent over the years with. “We cannot sit there at all times and monitor the situation. There needs to be a serious intervention by the higher ups,” a KTCL official told TOI.
