Under the MoU, Kulkarni promised the company to get a loan of Rs 23 crore, and duped it. During a raid on his rented Khar 14th Road flat, investigators found incriminating documents, including papers related to a case in Delhi wherein he was booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
