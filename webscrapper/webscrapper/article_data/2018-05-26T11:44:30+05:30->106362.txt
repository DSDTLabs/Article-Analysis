GAYA: Monitoring and other surveillance system installed at the   integrated checkpost including   cameras and weighbridge were found non-functional during a joint inspection by   district magistrate (DM) Abhishek Singh and SSP   on Friday morning.

 Altogether, nine officials deputed at the integrated checkpost were also found absent from duty during the inspection. “The absentee officials would be put under suspension,” he said.
 
 Officials did not rule out sabotage of the CCTV and weighbridge to facilitate illegal activity by checkpost employees and middlemen. Sources said that overloaded trucks are allowed to pass through and there is no mechanism in place to check the weight. Besides causing huge revenue loss, overloading inflicts heavy damage to road conditions.
 
 The DM added that an inquiry will be done to ascertain the cause of non-functioning of the surveillance system and action will be taken if evidence of sabotage surfaces during the inquiry. He also said that there was complete lack of coordination between the officials of different departments deputed at the checkpost. “Employees of transport department, mining, forest, state excise etc. are deputed there, but there is lack of coordination among them,” he added.
 
 “Extortion from transporters is also rampant and efforts will be made to put an end to it. Henceforth one magistrate and a police officer will be deputed at the checkpost to monitor and establish coordination between different departments,” said the DM.
 
 “There will be nearly 300% increase in revenue if things are set right. Our priority, however is to get the CCTV and weighbridge functional,” said Singh.
