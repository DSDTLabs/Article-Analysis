TIRUPATI: A team of researchers from Israel is now working on finding a genetic solution to the ever-increasing menace of antibiotic resistance to a plethora of diseases including tuberculosis (TB) and hospital-acquired infections. The team has targeted the notorious bacteria called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( ). This bacteria is quite common in several hospitals around the world including Hyderabad.

 The team headed by Nobel laureate Prof Ada E Yonath, chief of the structural biology department,  ,  , Israel, is in final stages of developing an effective drug to fight drug-resistant pathogens. Prof Ada delivered a talk on ribosomes, which build proteins in body cells. The novel drug will act on ribosomes for effective treatment.
 
 Prof Ada, an expert in structural biology, expressed concern over increasing cases of bacteria developing resistance to a variety of known medicines. This, she said, has become a major global threat. With pathogens developing resistance to antibiotics, doctors are now left with a fewer powerful antibiotics. She said the new drug molecule will help fight antibiotic resistance. The group has developed a novel molecule called Lefamulin. It has been found to be highly effective to treat diseases that have become resistant to a set of antibiotics. This drug targets pneumonia in particular. It is now in phase III clinical trials.
 
 Staphylococcus aureus is fast developing resistance and this is the reason why it continues to thrive in hospitals causing new infections to patients. Prof Adaâ€™s research has provided rare insights into the micro world of biology.
 
 Earlier, she was honoured by Prime Minister   for her contribution to the development of science.
