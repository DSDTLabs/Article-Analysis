NAGPUR: After a long wait Mahametro (earlier NMRCL) got possession of entire Central Jail land required for the project. The agency had earlier got possession of 15,326 square metres land inside the jail for construction of viaduct. Now it has the land required for constructing   station. With this, no more government land is needed for construction of Mihan depot to Sitabuldi stretch of the Metro.

 A source in Mahametro said the 5,738 square metres land for the station had been given on condition that the agency gets permission from   (NMC) to fell trees on it. “Some trees will have to be felled and we have already applied for the necessary permission. We have also paid a part of compensation amount and the remaining will be paid soon. We will begin construction only after NMC green signal,” he said.
 
 The source further said the bushes on jail land had been cleared and work had begin on construction of piles (columns) for the Metro viaduct, which is about 500 metre long.
 
 Meanwhile, Mahametro has dropped plans for constructing an underpass to link two portions of Central Jail separated by the Metro corridor. “Jail authorities shot down the proposal on security grounds. Now we will construct a covered foot overbridge,” the source said.
 
 This decision will reduce the cost of the project as the underpass would have cost much more. “We proposed a foot overbridge but the home department demanded that an underpass be constructed. Later the jail officials changed their mind,” the source said.
 
 Mahametro has also started the work of shifting electric poles, water pipelines, etc from opposite Ajni railway station. Once this is done, work will begin on Congress Nagar Metro station.
