CHARMINAR: The fortified wall in Old City, once built to protect citizens from invading armies looks like it is in dire need of protection now. The remains of the granite built six-mile circumference wall, constructed around the city centuries ago, are located at  , Fateh Darwaza,   and Sultan Shah. The biggest stretch exists between Lal Darwaza and Aliabad Darwaza, but it is in a very dilapidated state and only a small portion survives.

 Heritage activists speak of a time when the wall had 13 gates and windows, the last to be built was the  . 
 
 "The gates of the wall would open at dusk and closed after dawn and the keys were kept with a senior official for security purposes," said  , co-convenor of INTACH, adding that that most of the wall between Puranapul and Darulshifa was destroyed during the 1908 floods.
 
 "As the city was developing, people saw the wall as a hindrance and dismantled it in most places," she said. "We have to save at least what we have left. The wall which still exists near Aliabad, Dabeerpura and Puranapul Darwaza can be saved if authorities take interest," Pasha pointed out.
