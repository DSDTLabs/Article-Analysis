BENGALURU: The   on Tuesday quashed the December 7, 2016 order issued by the Centre to entrust the probe into the murder of RSS worker Rudresh murder to the   (NIA). Rudresh was hacked to death by two men on a motorbike in   on October 16 last year. “The order smacks of arbitrariness and was issued in disregard to the requirements of Section 6(5) of the NIA Act. Without collecting any material, the under-secretary to the central government had passed the order on December 7, 2016 entrusting the investigation to NIA,“ Justice John Michael Cunha observed, while partly allowing petitions filed by the five accused.

 The judge, however, permitted Commercial Street police to continue with the probe under section 43 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The court also dismissed the accu sed's plea challenging the extension of the investigation duration to 180 days.
 
 Referring to the letter of then police commissioner   to the IGP of NIA, the judge said much before the order was passed by the Centre authorizing the NIA to investigate, the latter had collected information.“Apart from this letter, there was no other material before the Centre to facilitate it to form an opinion that the offence has been committed by the petitioners.The Centre was required to comply with the requirements of Section 6(5) of the NIA Act before directing probe by the NIA,“ Justice Cunha added.
 
 Waseem Ahmed, Mujeeb, Sadiq, Irfan Pasha and   local leader Asim Sharif had challenged the case and also suo-motu entrustment of the same to the NIA.
