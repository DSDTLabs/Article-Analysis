PANAJI: Banks across the state may be shut on February 28 and   are expected to take a hit, responding to a strike call made by the   (UFBU). Goa Bank Employees’ Association has announced its support to the one-day all India   called by UFBU, the umbrella forum for five bank employee unions and four officers’ associations.

 Slamming the Union government for “retrograde reform measures” UFBU wants their demands for greater accountability and employee benefits to be met.
 
 “Several issues pertaining to the bank employees and officers such as appointment of workmen, employee directors in the boards, adequate recruitment in all cadres, removal of ceiling on gratuity, exemption of income-tax on superannuation benefits, improvements in pension and issues relating to retirees are yet to be resolved,” UFBU outlined in their strike notice.
 
 The union has the reforms were against the public and labour interests. In the name of reform measures, these are efforts to shift control of public sector entities to private and foreign investors, the union said.
