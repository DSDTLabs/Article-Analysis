Lucky, the protagonist of   has the worst luck in the world. So much so, that the fortunes of people he runs into accidentally also change for the worse. 'Neeku 
kashtalu ekkadunnayi bhaiyya? Ninnu kalisinodiki kada kashtalu,' rue his friends. But lady luck smiles on him one fine day when he gets his hands on a fortune! 
 'What would you do if you suddenly have Rs 25 crores to yourself?' quips Vishnu Manchu summing up the basic premise of Luckunnodu. 'That kind of money can solve practically every problem one could have in life. But does it? That's what the film is all about,' he says.
 The success of last film prompted him to stick to the comedy genre, explains the actor saying, 'Eedo Rakam Aado Rakam was such a big success, that I had to follow it up with something that good. Moreover, I have to keep the pot boiling! I do commercial movies to put bread on the table at home, but I do balance it out with films like   and  . Either way it is my passion for acting that keeps me going.'
 Admittedly, Vishnu styled himself in the film! 'Yes, I styled myself in the film. His bad luck notwithstanding, Lucky is a happy young guy, who's not all that well-off but he can rock the two t-shirts he owns. So I put some thought into it and put together a few looks. But I did get a lot of help from the costume department,' he says. 
 And does Vishnu consider himself lucky? 'Well, I do think I'm lucky. To be one of the few ' 200 may be? ' stars, that have emerged out of the billion odd people in the country, is indeed an honour,' he says.
