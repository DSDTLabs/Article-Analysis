MUMBAI: Taximen on Friday threatened to dump their cabs at the four city RTOs from Monday onwards if there was compulsion to install speed governors with “immediate effect“. They also plan to move the Bombay high court in this connection.

 “We will leave our taxis at the RTO on Monday if officials fail to clear vehicles in annual fitness test,“ said union leader A L Quadros. Around 300 taxis arrive at the city RTOs daily for the tests. The officials are insisting the taxis should first be fitted with speed governors before coming for the mandatory fitness test. Any   will result in shortage of taxis on the city's roads next week.
 
 Taxi unions are not opposed to speed governors, but want at least three months for all vehicles to be fitted with them.  : “We have spoken to senior transport officials and requested them to defer implementation of the new rule. Taxi drivers should be allowed to install these governors within a time frame and it should not be done overnight.“
 
 State transport commissioner   said an amendment in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules (this month) makes it mandatory for all taxis to have speed governors. This includes kaalipeelis, aggregators and fleetcabs and the speed limit will be 80 kmph. “We are merely implementing the rules. Since unions want some time to install the gadgets, we are discussing this,“ he stated.
