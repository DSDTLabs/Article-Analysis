GURGAON: The state government might remove the Kherki Daula   altogether, instead of shifting it to  , according to multiple sources within the government. The talks for the removal of the toll plaza are currently in early stages and the finances are being worked out in terms of the total liability. 

 Sources said that the removal of the toll plaza from the Delhi- Jaipur expressway would cost nearly Rs 1,200 crore, of which the government has to arrange for Rs 800 crore. “Talks are on about how we will fund the removal of the toll plaza, if that is the decision,” said a senior government official in the know of the matter. He said that there was also a possibility that the MCG would pitch in for the removal of the toll plaza. “The talks are in early stages now, but MCG might be funding the removal partly, if we decide to remove the toll plaza,” said the official. 
 
 Talks of moving the toll plaza to another location have been going for a couple of years now. The shifting of the toll plaza was officially announced in 2017 by   minister for road transport and highways  . The district administration also allocated a piece of land in Sehrawan, Manesar, in December 2017. 
 
 However, that decision invited criticism from environmentalists who said that a toll plaza at Sehrawan would adversely impact the wildlife in the region. TOI had reported on January 8 that a group of environmentalists had objected to the decision, saying a rise in the number of vehicles using the highway would adversely affect the wildlife in the Aravali zone. There are other hurdles, as well, besides environmental concerns. 
 
 According to a few sources, a consortium of banks has told the authorities that the toll plaza cannot be located at a distance of over 42 kms from Delhi, whereas the new site is 53 km from Delhi, said the source. Faced with these hurdles, the government is now planning to remove the toll plaza altogether.
