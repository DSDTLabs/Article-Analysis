NEW DELHI:   chose to confront three-time former chief minister of Delhi,  , over her warning to the   government saying, “Politics of confrontation with the LG and Centre will yield no results.” 

 AAP reinforced the Kerjiwal government’s allegations of how the Centre has taken away powers linked to decision-making on matters related to bureaucracy, action against corrupt and non-performing officers and the discretion to not send all files to LG.
 
 The party has called upon the former Congress CM to come out and answer the key concern about the powers that she had but have been   by the Centre in case of AAP. When contacted for her reaction, Dikshit said, “As a matter of fact I had no extra powers. I only had what the constitutional position allows. We worked within that frame and that is what it is.” On Friday, TOI spoke to Dikshit on her experience with the LG and Centre.
 
 Kerjiwal had on Friday said in the Delhi assembly that the Delhi government should have complete power to make transfers and postings of officers, control over services, and in matters where the legislative assembly has the competence to make laws, the powers to take decisions should be with the elected government.
 
 In a press conference on Saturday, AAP’s Delhi chief spokesperson   said, “Many times Sheila Dikshit said that only when equation with LG and Centre is good that work happens. Here I would like to remind her that in her first tenure (from 1998) it was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government at the Centre and he had good equations with nearly all CMs across states. After that, the Congress was in power at the Centre until her three-term tenure ended.”
 
 Bharadwaj went on to allege that currently PM Modi’s relationship with every non-BJP and NDA-led state’s chief minister is far from genial. “Hence, it is not possible to build a good relationship with the Centre,” he added.
