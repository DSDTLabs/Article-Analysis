 The ministry had issued a circular few months ago to the police in all the states directing them to ensure that the software is introduced and used by both the police and passport offices for rapid issuance of passports.

The software ensures that both the police and passport authorities can verify all the documents submitted by an applicant and eliminates the physical transfer of the same between the two agencies.
 
 VRPO passport officer   said, "We are presently able to issue passports within nine days of application as against 11 days in 2015. We aim to further reduce the time by implementing the ministry directions. We already wrote to all the senior police officers and if this materialises, everyone from the passport office staff to the applicants will benefit."
