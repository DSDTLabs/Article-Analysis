NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Tuesday welcomed the   favouring negotiations between the rival sides to resolve the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute but also seemed set to move the top court to seek expeditious hearing if renewed dialogue did not yield a solution.

 “We appreciate the feelings of the court. It is a genuine desire to find a solution to a sensitive issue. BJP has consistently maintained that courts are not the ideal platform for sorting out issues of faith since they concern faith of millions,” a senior government functionary said.
 
 However, he added that a resolution could not be delayed and the government would move the top court to speed up hearings if the two sides did not agree to come to the negotiating table or talks between them did not help solve the vexed issue.
 
 “The matter has been hanging fire since 1999 when Hindus started praying. The   verdict endorsing the stand of the majority community came in 2010. The matter cannot be allowed to hang fire any more,” he added.
 
 The leader also said the possibility of the UP government, now headed by BJP’s  , moving the SC was very high, and emphasised that the freshly sworn-in chief minister was among the staunch advocates for early construction of Ram temple at the disputed site. The CM is the mahant of Gorakhnath Math and his predecessors, Mahant Digvijay Nath and Mahant Avaidyanath, formed the vanguard of the push for construction of the temple.
