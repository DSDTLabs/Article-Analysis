Recently, it was announced that   will be playing the role of a cop for the first time in newcomer Ganeshaa’s Thimiru Pudichavan. The latest is that actress   has been roped in to play the female lead. Interestingly, she, too, will don the khakhi in this film. 

 Ganeshaa says, “Nivetha’s role is that of a cop in the movie. I wanted someone who can ride a Bullet to play the role. In fact, when I first met Nivetha, I asked her if she knew how to ride that bike. She immediately said she would learn it and soon began training for the same. But in the film, the hero doesn’t ride a bike of the same make!” The director also reveals that there is ample scope for the actress to perform. “Nivetha’s character in the film is crucial to the script. Her character will be travelling throughout the film. She also plays Vijay’s love interest.” 
 
 The film’s puja will take place today and the team will begin shooting for the film in Chennai.
