PUTTUR: BJP chief   on Tuesday reminded youth that the present   government has come to power not merely to run a government, but to transform and develop India. “This government will not take decisions that are populist or to appease anyone, but tough decisions that will benefit the country in the long run. It is only such measures that will ensure, ‘Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas,’ and ensure that the fruits of development reaches the last man standing,” he said.

 Addressing students of   institutions here on ‘Student Power in Shaping Nava Bharat’, Shah said, “While he and his generation will not be around 50-years down the line, it is the present day youth who will be at the helm of affairs and vested with decision making for the nation. Swaraj as envisioned is not just government of the people, but one that is truly for the people,” he said, adding that the government will uplift both the people as well as their culture.
 
 Citing a few examples, that his government has achieved in this regard, Shah said, “The nation now has changed the scale of transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We have provided toilets to 7.5 crore households, separate toilets for girls in schools, electrified 13,000 out of 18,000 villages and complete the rest by May,” he said. “In addition, 3.5-crore economically poor women have been provided LPG connections, which will reach 8 crore beneficiaries soon,” he said.
 
 Noting that quite a few have questioned him on citing toilets as a model of development, Shah said India cannot have a scenario where half the country is in the 21st century, and rest in the 18thor 19th centuries. “Development is not just for Lutyens’ Delhi,” Shah said, adding that youth can help change the scale of development that is taking place across India. “It is imperative that even youth of the state join this process of development like their counterparts in the rest of India,” he said.
