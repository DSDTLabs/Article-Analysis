NEW DELHI:   across the country will start a month-long   from May 1 to draw attention of PM Narendra Modi and chief ministers of all the states towards the harassment faced by them.

 As a part of the campaign, organised by National Association of   Vendors of India (NASVI), street   will write a message on a postcard to the PM and CMs telling them about their problems.
 
 “Vendors are being evicted and continuously harassed by police and municipal officials throughout the country. We want both the central and state governments to take concrete steps to stop this illegal eviction and ensure that these people are allowed to earn their livelihood without any fear,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator, NASVI.
 
 NASVI demands that PM directs the ministries of urban development and housing and poverty alleviation to take necessary measures to safeguard the interest of street vendors. 
 
 Chief ministers have an important role as the state governments have to implement the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and regulation of Street vending) Act, 2014. While many states have implemented the Act, there are some, including Delhi, which are yet to formulate a policy for its implementation.
