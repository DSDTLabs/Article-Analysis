LAMBI (MUKTSAR): With campaigning drawing to a close for the February 4 Punjab polls, Congress vice-president   while addressing public here on Thursday made five promises with the people to be fulfilled in the first five months of the government formation. 

 Addressing a rally at Mann Singh Sports Stadium, Rahul said, “The Congress will enact stringent laws to deal with those involved in drug peddling. They will be put behind bars and their properties seized.”
 
 On the second promise, the Congress vice-president said land would be provided to Dalits and poor from the common village land. “The process will be started in two months of the government formation,” he said while canvassing for Punjab Congress chief  , who is contesting from Lambi against chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.
 
 In the third promise, he announced to clear the backlog of jobs for the poor and Dalits in three months. “We will bring industries to Punjab, which had moved out of the state due to wrong policies of the 10-year rule of the SAD-BJP,” he said. Making the fourth promise, Rahul said treatment would be free for all residents of Punjab, even for the chronic diseases in four months. “Nobody will have to pay anything for getting cured of diseases. Government hospitals will be refurbished to make these people-friendly in providing quality treatment without paying money,” he said. 
 
 For his fifth one, he promised that the Congress government in Punjab would ensure unity among various communities and maintain harmony in the state. 
 
 Turning his attention to Delhi CM  , he blamed him for the blast in Maur town of Bathinda, where six persons, including four children, lost their lives. “Kejriwal is supporting such forces. If it happens, progress will stop in the state. The Congress will not allow such things to happen as Punjab has already faced a lot,” Rahul maintained.
