MUMBAI: A brother-sister duo were recently sentenced to a year in jail in three cases of theft. 

 According to the police, the bike-borne duo of   (29) and Ruth Gaye (33) would snatch bags at   signals from unsuspecting auto passengers and bikers in 2011. While the maximum sentence for such thefts is three years, the court showed leniency, stating the accused were young and had also given an assurance they would reform. 
 
 “Admittedly for such type of criminals, the initial few months of jail life are the most painful and, therefore, the biggest deterrent. In the present case, the accused must well have realized that the game of crime does not pay. In this case, the young age and responsibilities that lie with the accused persons appear to be the sole ground for showing a lenient view,” the court held. 
 
 All three complaints were registered with the Juhu police. On March 14, 2011 Duriya Bangali from Juhu said she was on her way to her boutique at 4.45pm on her motorcycle when the accused came on a motorcycle, pushed her and snatched her purse. Another victim,  , complained that on the midnight of April 28, 2011 she was in an autorickshaw on the   when someone came on a motorcycle and snatched her purse. 
 
 In the third instance, on May 10, 2011, Andheri resident Dr   told cops that he was heading toward a Juhu hotel in an autorickshaw when the accused snatched his bag. His total loss was pegged at Rs 90,000.
