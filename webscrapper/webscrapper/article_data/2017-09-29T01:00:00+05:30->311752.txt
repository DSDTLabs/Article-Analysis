Born at a time when the evil power of   was terrorising the entire universe, the need of a hero was imminent. Lord Shiva wanted his son to have a one-point agenda in his life — destruction of evil. But his mother, Goddess Parvati wanted her son to be compassionate as well. Torn between the opposing philosophies, Muruga learns to question everything and decides for himself what is fit. This rebellious trait will eventually lead him to leave his paternal home and carve out a new land for himself. Love and war are respectively called akam (inner life) and puram (outer life of action).

 According to a source, “Actress   of Mapillai fame is essaying the role of Parvati in this serial; Anirudha is Lord Muruga. Television actor Sasindhar Pushpalingam will be seen as Lord Shiva. The series also involves several other characters. What will be interesting is that the team has gone all out with graphics and visual effects for the show. The serial is based on the Tamil mythology Kandha Puranam, which traces the life of Muruga from his birth to Soorasamharam. The story of Muruga will be retold in a grand way, with the help of visual effects and computer graphics.” The show is slated to go on air on October 2.
