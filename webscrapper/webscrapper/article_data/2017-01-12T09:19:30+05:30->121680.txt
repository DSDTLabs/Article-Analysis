GANDHINAGAR: Even as the deadlock over Goods and   (GST) remains, with the Centre and states failing to reach a consensus on issues such as dual control and taxing high sea trade, Union finance minister   on Wednesday said he hoped that these matters would be settled over the next few weeks.

 When asked if the Centre would be able to roll out GST from April 1, 2017, Jaitley said: “We want it to be implemented from April 1, 2017, if all issues are resolved. However, it is a constitutional requirement that GST is implemented before September 16. And it is essential that the law comes into force before September 16.” Speaking at a special seminar organized on GST in the ongoing Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017 at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar, the Union minister said, “Most of these issues have been sorted out, some critical issues remain.” 
 
 Issues such as higher compensation demanded by states following demonetization threaten to delay the implementation of GST. “We are working overtime to make it a reality at the earliest,” revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said at the same event. “Our target is April 1, 2017. We will try our best to bring GST (on the targeted date) for the people of our country.”
 
 Digitization spurred by demonetization will expand the informal economy, Jaitley said. “This coupled with GST will have a combined effect on the economy, and will accelerate growth,” he said. Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said that the state was ready to implement GST and traders as well as industrialists in Gujarat were waiting for the implementation of the new tax regime.
