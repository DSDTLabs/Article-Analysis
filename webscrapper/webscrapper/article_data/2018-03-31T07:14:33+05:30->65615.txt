PUNE: Anil Kolhe (27), an undertrial prisoner lodged in the  , ended his life by   passing over the Tilak barrack in the jail on Wednesday afternoon. 

 U T Pawar, the jail superintendent, told TOI that Kolhe climbed up a tree near the barrack around 1pm on Wednesday and went on the roof. "When he went near the live wire, other inmates and wardens raised an alarm. They also requested him not to touch the wire," he said. 
 
 "Before anyone of them could climb up the roof, Kolhe touched the wire and electrocuted himself," said Pawar. Kolhe was taken to a jail hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. 
 
 Pawar said Kolhe was arrested in February in connection with the abduction of a girl and he was in the prison since then. "The inmates from his barrack said Kolhe was not talking with anyone for the past few days," he said.
 
 A case of accidental death has been registered with the   police.
 
 Last November, a man sentenced to death for sodomizing and murdering a boy hanged himself in the same prison.
