CHENNAI: When they tried to rescue him from the Pallavaram bus stand, he didn't show any resistance. But he never uttered a word to anyone for almost two weeks. One day , he said, “I am Sahi from Punjab.“ To make him happy , they played some Punjabi songs. A week later, he said, “I am   from Jharkhand.“ The team that rescued him managed to trace his family in Jharkhand's Ranchi, using the broken conversations that they had with him in Hindi.

 The team at  , a transit home for wandering men with mental illness, has rescued more than 100 men soon. Sadly , some stay back because their families don't want them back.
 
 It was a survey that   conducted with his found abandoned in public places since its launch in 2011.More than 60 mentally ill men, between the age of 22 and 48 years, have returned to their families in various states in India so far. Now, there are 27 men and five will reunite with their families Antony conducted with his friend Sekhar in 2010 to record the wandering men with mental illness which eventually led them to open Manasu, a government-licensed psychiatric rehabilitation home in Trisulam. The three-room house could accommodate only five to six people at a time. So Antony and his team decided to focus on youngsters, particularly migratory workers who were found abandoned in bus stands and railway stations.
 
 “It's a transit home. A wandering man with mental illness is rescued with the help of police. They issue a memo as a record. The rescued man will undergo medical check-up. More than medicine, it's our love and affection that matter in many cases here,“ said Antony .
 
 In one case, an inmate Bhola suffered a mental breakdown while he was on his way to Hyderabad from Bihar. He was rescued five months ago and will be returning home in Bihar soon.“I was going to Hyderabad in search of a job. I suffered a mental breakdown and ended up in Chennai. I was clueless about the place. Now I am alright,“ said the 23-year-old.
