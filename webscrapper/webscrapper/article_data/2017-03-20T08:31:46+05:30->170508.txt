MOHALI:   had shifted with his wife and two children to the house in Phase 3B1, where he was killed, around 15 days back.

 House owner   said, “I had never seen them fighting. He used to leave for his work around 10 am and return at 6pm or 7pm. He was a nice person. He always used to drop his kids to school.”
 
 Relatives too were in a shock over what led Sirat Kaur to kill her husband in cold blood. 
 
 Ekam and his younger brother   were in the property business. Sources said Ekam had property worth more than Rs 5 crore and was planning to invest in   and had even taken some steps towards it.
 
 Darshan Singh said, “I don’t know the reason behind the murder but Sirat killed him. Ekam never revealed but he was being mentally tortured by his in-laws for over six months.”
 
 Jaspal Singh, father of the victim, said, “My son and Sirat got married in 2003. They were living on their own since then. There were no hiccups in their relationship.” “Around six months ago, Ekam seemed to have fallen under depression but he never told the reason to anyone,” he added.
 
 It was also found that Ekam had transferred some property in the name of his mother-in-law, which had not pleased Sirat. Sources said the two had a dispute over some issue around three months back but it was settled.
