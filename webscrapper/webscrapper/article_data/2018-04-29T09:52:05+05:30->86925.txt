HYDERABAD: All offices in   commissionerate, including police stations, will become paperless from May 1 after implementation of the E-Office software. 

 A meeting was held by Hyderabad police commissioner   on Saturday with all the police officers, from the rank of sub-inspector to additional commissioners, to review the implementation of the upcoming project. 
 
 "E-Office is a computer software application in which all the files of Hyderabad police will now move through email and other digital formats. The main objective is to make the police stations and offices paperless," a press release issued by Hyderabad police to media personnel said. 
 
 The pending files can be tracked through this software. The software will also have features to reveal how many days an officer has kept a file pending. All officials in Hyderabad police, including members from commissionerate and police stations, underwent training in the last one month to execute the project.
