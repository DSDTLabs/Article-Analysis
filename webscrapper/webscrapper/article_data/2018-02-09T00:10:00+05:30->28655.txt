Rajaratha, which has been shot in both   and Telugu, will now   on March 23. Says actor  , “The movie has been pushed to March 23 for two reasons. One, the censorship process for Rajaratham (in Telugu) is not yet done. And second, since all the exams — both engineering and pre-university — finish by the third week of March, we thought its best to push the film for March 23. The film is about   and college students and we want them to watch it. It made no sense if the film was to be pushed by just one week.” The film stars Nirup and Avantika Shetty in the lead roles.
