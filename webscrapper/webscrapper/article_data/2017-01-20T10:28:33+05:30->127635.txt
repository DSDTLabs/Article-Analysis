JAIPUR: After much delay, the state government has finally promoted four IAS officers of 1985 batch to apex grade scale (Rs 80,000 fixed). Three among them have been given the rank of additional chief secretary. Two other officers from the same batch have been left out from the list.

 IAS officer Rajeev Swarup, J C Mohanty and   were promoted to the rank of additional chief secretary. IAS officer  , who is the chairman of   too has been given the paygrade of same rank. The officer who could not make it to additional chief secretary is   and  .
 
 Promotion of 1984 batch was lingering on for the past two years. Rajasthan was the only state apart from Maharashtra where officers were serving as principal secretaries. Officials claim that the government was under pressure as delay held up the elevation of officer from the junior batches. 
 
 As per the orders, the new designation and pay scale is effective from January 1, 2017. “This should have been done much before as there has been a loss of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh annually. Still it is a welcome move,” said one of the officials who were promoted. 
 
 However, the biggest challenge in front of the government is to settle down the issue of 1992 batch officers. Earlier at the starting of the year, the government had elevated two IPS officers of inspector general (IG) rank. But six IAS officers from same year batch were kept at their previous rank. This has made these IPS officers senior to the bureaucrats although all of them have the same date of joining.
 
 The six IAS officers have made sought the intervention of the government to balance out the incongruity. It is expected department of personnel will soon take decision on it.
