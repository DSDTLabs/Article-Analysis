In the upcoming track of the show Chidiyaghar, everyone is ready to celebrate Mayuri’s ( ) birthday party. As everyone is enjoying on the dance floor, Mayuri forcefully drags Gomukh ( ) too.
 
  Gomukh who is not confident about his dancing skills, ends up stamping on Mayuri’s feet. Mayuri yells at him in front of everybody. Gomukh feels deeply humiliated.
  
  In the meantime, there is a dance competition, which is going to take place, Puppy ( ) who is a dance trainer thinks of participating with Mayuri. His only motive to participate with Mayuri is to get a chance to visit Chidiyaghar frequently and get to know whether Koyal ( ) likes him or not. Gomukh gets insecure after seeing Puppy and Mayuri dance together. A jealous Gomukh tries to interrupt their training sessions and confronts Mayuri which leads to a fight. She gets emotional and decides to stop practicing.
  
  
 
  
  Babuji (Rajendra Gupta) explains to Gomukh on how one should never be egotistical and advises him to learn dancing. After listening to Babuji, Gomukh goes through a makeover and enters the dance venue as a handsome hunk, who is learning how to dance. Nobody recognises him. Mayuri and Puppy clear various rounds in the competition and enter the final round. But on the final day, Puppy gets injured and he recommends that the charming guy (Gomukh) should dance with Mayuri.
  
  Finally, Mayuri and Gomukh perform on the final day of competition. The judges are impressed and feel that Mayuri and Gomukh might not be the best dancers but their chemistry and co-ordination was the best. Finally Gomukh reveals his identity claiming that he had made efforts to learn dance only for Mayuri.
  
  Sumit Arora said, “Gomukh is hurt by the humiliation. But the struggle and dedication he goes through to learn dancing for Mayuri, is worth watching.”
