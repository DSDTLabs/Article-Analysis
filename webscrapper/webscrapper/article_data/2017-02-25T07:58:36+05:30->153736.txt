AMRAVATI: BJP MLA and its Amravati campaign chief Dr Sunil Deshmukh has attributed the spectacular success of the party in the civic elections to people’s trust on Prime Minister   and chief minister  .

 When asked whether he was expecting BJP to win 45 seats, he said, “It was truly beyond our expectations. People were in a mood for change. It is also the upshot of the efforts of all our party workers. The clear mandate also puts a great responsibility on us to provide a transparent administration.”
 
 With the thumping win, BJP is now certain to have its mayor in the House. “The mayor’s post is reserved for SC candidate and we have ten in our rank. Our mayor will be one who has the capacity to run AMC affairs competently,” he told TOI.
 
 “Our priority will be to seek funds to complete pending projects. We will attack the roots of corruption in garbage management,” he said.
 
 But even as BJP prospered in Amravati, it wilted in the district. “It is a fact that we could not get expected success in Zilla Parishad. Since I was given the responsibility of AMC, I did not pay attention to ZP. However, BJP should take the opponents with it on the issues of development.”
 
 In the meantime, BJP’s success has raised many eyebrows and several complaints were made with the collector last night, especially by  , demanding enquiry into EVMs. “The losers must accept defeat sportingly. Instead of blaming EVMs, they should take the blame for the loss,” Deshmukh said.
