BHOPAL: A major glitch in the Dial 108 server left the ambulance service across the state critically choked for around five hours on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. 

 The snap forced to put at least one hundred emergency calls on hold. Patients had to take the neighbouring services such as auto-rickshaws to reach hospitals, sources said. 
 
 Aslam Khan, spokesperson of 108 Ambulance Employee Association, said: “We were unable to receive calls from the server from around 1 am on Saturday night. Soon, we came to know that the server went out of order. The services resumed after 6 am. The private company,   (ZHL), which takes care of the services doesn’t have back-ups to tackle such crisis.”
 
 “The server collapsed almost 10 times over the past one month. At times, it doesn’t work for two hours continuously and this may go on for say 10 hours,” Khan said.
 
 Ram Parmaar, an ambulance driver, said: “We usually keep moving across the localities to provide immediate service. We also share our contact numbers with people so that they can reach us quickly.”
 
 On March 23, around 50 calls had to be put on hold after the Dial 108 server went out of order for around two hours. Road accident victims had a torrid time to reach hospitals. A patient, who was referred to the Hamidia hospital from the JP Hospital, kept calling the Dial 108, but failed. Finally, he reached the hospital by an auto-rickshaw.
 
 When TOI contacted  , operational in-charge, ZHL, he said: “The IT employees know the reason. I am on leave today and can any reason after talking to IT personnel.”
