Pune: Instead of being thanked for his goodwill gesture, a policeman, who helped an accident victim, was abused and attacked by the latter.  The incident occurred near a PMMPL bus stop at Bhairavnath temple in Kondhwa around 5.30pm on Thursday. Acting on the complaint filed by constable Sarjerao Patil (32) from Kondhwa traffic division, the police arrested the suspect, Gaurav Baburao Yadav (27), from Vadgaonsheri. Yadav, who was riding a two-wheeler, fell down after his vehicle skidded. Patil was manning traffic nearby. He rushed to the scene to help the biker and inquired about his condition. The sub-inspector of Kondhwa police, Sanjay Lokhande, said on Sunday, “The two-wheeler rider, however, did not find Patil’s attitude pleasing and instead of thanking him for the goodwill gesture lost his cool. Yadav not only abused and attacked Patil but also created a commotion on the road.” “We have arrested Yadav under sections 353 (obstructing public servant from performing duty) and 504 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code,”Lokhande added.
