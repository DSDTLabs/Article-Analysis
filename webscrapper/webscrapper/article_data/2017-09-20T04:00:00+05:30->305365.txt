Surat: A 22-year-old man, who is facing harassment charges levelled against him by his former girlfriend, was arrested here on Monday. The 18-year-old girl approached Adajan police station after she was threatened with acid attack by the man who has been harassing her for the past 18 months. 

 The girl claimed that she had to change her residence twice because of harassment by a mobile phone salesman Aamir Khan. Khan was released on bail on Tuesday. The girl told the police that she had an affair with the man for over two years, but they separated. Now, since one-and-a-half years he has been harassing her.
