Sajid Nadiadwala's action comedy-romance,'Judwaa', which is returning with Varun Dhawan in  's shoes as the twins Raja and Prem, also has the original hero in a double role. 

 The actor shot his portions over the weekend. Mirror has learnt that Salman and his on-screen twin bumps into Varun and his when they are on a getaway with their love interests   and Taapsee Pannu.
 
  "It's a comic climax sequence with all the six characters interacting with each other and is shot against a green screen over two and-a-half days at a studio in Mumbai. With this, the film's India shoot has officially wrapped up," a source close to the development informed Mirror. The final, 12-13-day schedule of the   directorial will be shot in Portugal next month.
 
  
  
 â€œDuring the recent shoot, Sajid, Salman and David, who are reuniting after 21 years of the original, went down memory lane recalling moments from the earlier shoot, while Varun, Taapsee and Jackie sat listening wide-eyed, like fascinated young fans," the source added.
 
 While Varun shared that "Judwaa 2 just got bigger" with Salman's entry, Tapsee informed that all her "talking portions for the film were officially over". An overwhelmed Jacqueline, who marks her sixth   production turn with the 'Judwaa' sequel, got emotional. "A picture may say a thousand words but I wouldn't be able to upload enough to describe today!" she exclaimed, referring to the group picture with her 'Kick' co-star Salman. "I am around my favourite people who've been with me and supported me in my   journey since the first day." She went on to thank her co-star Taapsee, rubbishing rumours of a cold war during the film's recent schedule London.
