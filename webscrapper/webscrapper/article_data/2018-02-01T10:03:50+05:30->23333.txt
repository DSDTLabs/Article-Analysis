 On June 13, 2013, Paramasivan of Melpazhananthal village filed a complaint with police stating that his four-year-old daughter,  , was missing. Six days after she had gone missing, her decomposed body was found in a well in a neighbouring village.
 
 Police came to know that Manikandan had picked up the girl from her school. Since Manikandan was familiar with the girl and his family, teachers let her go home with him. Police arrested Manikandan on June 22 of the same year, said special public prosecutor G Archana.
 
 On interrogation, he confessed to have murdered the girl. He told police that he had borrowed money from the girl’s father. The girl’s father allegedly abused him for not returning the money. To avenge the humiliation, Manikandan murdered the girl.
