RGURUGRAM:   has finally allotted an alternative plot to  , a 25-year-old automobile engineer, in Sector 23A, putting an end to his year-long ordeal.
 
 TOI had in February reported that the young engineer was allotted a piece of   by Huda last year that it did not actually own. “I got the physical possession of the land just two days back. Now I can start construction of my house on this plot,” said Tarun, adding he had paid Huda Rs 28 lakh for the said land.
 
 
 In fact,   had bought a piece of land in Sector 23A from Huda through e-auction on May 27 last year and subsequently received its nod to mortgage the plot for availing bank loan, got the possession certificate as well as conveyance deed, all within four months.
 
 And he got the approval for his building plan on September 25 last year, only to be told a week later that he could not start construction on the plot as it belongs to a private individual and not Huda.
 
 “I had been coughing up Rs 31,000 per month as   for the loan I availed against the plot. I have taken another Rs 40 lakh loan for paying for the land as well as building my dream home. The entire incident put me under great mental and financial stress. I was facing problem for trusting a government agency,” said Tarun.
 
 Admitting its fault, a senior Huda official said, Tarun had to face inconvenience “due to our fault”. “The department has already acted against its official for negligence. He has been allotted an alternative plot in the same sector.”
