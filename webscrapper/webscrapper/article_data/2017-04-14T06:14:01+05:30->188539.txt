PUNE: Social crusader Anna   has opposed the Union government’s plan to amend the Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005, saying it is an attempt to make it “ineffective and difficult for people to use”.

 In a letter to PM Narendra   on Thursday, Hazare warned of an   if the government did not shelve its plan and said diluting the   would be like denying people their fundamental right. He reminded Modi of the opposition the Manmohan Singh government faced in 2006 when an attempt was made to remove file notings from the purview of the RTI Act.
 
 Hazare said a proposed RTI 2017 rule would allow a petitioner to withdraw an appeal and, in case a verdict is given on the petition, an appeal against the same would be disallowed. This provision can be misused, Hazare said in the letter.
 
 Rule 12(2) allows an application to be dismissed in case the petitioner dies. The existing Act allows uploading of the information sought on the website of the office concerned if the applicant dies. “This is an extremely dangerous provision for those who use the RTI Act. We have already seen numerous attacks on RTI activists,” Hazare said.
 
 Hazare has also opposed the 500-word limit for filing an RTI application and doubling of fees for demanding photocopies.
