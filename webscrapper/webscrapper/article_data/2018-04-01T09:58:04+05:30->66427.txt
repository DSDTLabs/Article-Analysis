BHUBANESWAR:   are not alien to defying odds in Indian football. The way they had created history by winning the   a season ago has already become stuff of legend.

 
 At the   on Saturday, they added another incredibly odds-defying chapter to their three-season-old history at the top level of Indian football, sending   champions   packing with a 7-5 win via penalty shootout after their Super Cup opener was tied 2-2 in regulation and extra-times.
 
 Aizawl managed to score all five of their kicks with H Lalmuankima beating Chennaiyin keeper Karanjit Singh with a ‘Panenka’ to cap the memorable victory. For Chennaiyin, striker Mohammad Rafi failed to find the target while their last shot was not required.
 
 It was Aizawl’s match to lose right from the start. Their Romanian attacking midfielder   handed the former I-League champions the lead twice in the game, first in the 23rd minute and the second in the very first minute of extra-time. Chennaiyin, however, clawed their back on both occasions, through   (89th minute) and Dhanachandra Singh (115th minute). But Chennaiyin could not be third time lucky as Aizawl players were spot-on in the resultant shootout, completing the massive upset.
 
 Chennaiyin FC entered the field, carrying the swagger of being the ISL champions, but Aizawl FC turned the game on its head with a breath-taking display of grit and energy.
 
 Ionescu broke the deadlock when he, having skipped past Mailson, unleashed a low drive from the edge of the box. It took a deflection off a Chennaiyin FC defender before being nestled into the bottom corner of the far post, away from goalkeeper Karnajit's outstretched hands.
 
 Chennaiyin were a far cry from their rearguard resilience which saw them through   in the ISL final a fortnight ago. Their attacking buildups uncharacteristically slow and their defensive set-up vulnerable to Aizawl’s counter-attacks.
