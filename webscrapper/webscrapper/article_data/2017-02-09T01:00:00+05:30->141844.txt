PATNA: With Valentine’s Day less than a week away, many couples — married and unmarried — have started thronging Patna shops to buy gifts or cards for partners. There are, however, others who celebrate the day, originally associated with romantic love, with near and dear ones who are not necessarily their romantic interest.

 Take, for instance, Patna Law College student Sachin Ahir who makes it a point to make his mother Mita Devi feel special on February 14. “Initially I would gift her a bunch of flowers ... Last year I gifted her confectionery. This time, however, I have planned a surprise gift, which I will not disclose to you,” said Sachin, who has been celebrating the day to please his mom since he was in Class XII.
 
 Does Sachin also gift anything to his father Bhola Prasad Yadav? “We are two brothers. My younger brother and I share an informal bonding with mother. No one loves us more than her. Of course, papa too loves us, but he also evokes fear,” explained the 25-year-old who presents gifts to his mother on Mother’s Day as well.
 
 Alka Jha celebrates February 14 with her students. “I did not know about the significance of the day during my school days, and came to know about it from my students,” said Jha, who has been teaching English at St Joseph’s Convent High School for the last 16 years.
 
 For Tushar Srivastava of Boring Road, his five St Bernards play his Valentines with whom he has organised a photo shoot this Valentine’s Day. “And like every year, I will gift my pets new ribbons and collars,” said the 25-year-old event planner.
 
 Tushar has to organise an event on February 14. “Yet I will take time off my hectic schedule to dress Bella, Damru, Lozy, Mory and Liza in new apparel and take them for a walk,” he said, adding he has a girlfriend who is also a dog lover.
 
 Sachin, Alka and Tushar are not exceptions. There are many who shower love and affection on grandparents, sons, daughters and siblings in a special way on February 14.
