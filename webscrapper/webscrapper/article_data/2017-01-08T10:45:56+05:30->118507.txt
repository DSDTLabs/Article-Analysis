HYDERABAD:   who rescued around 199 minors including girls who were employed at a brick kiln on the outskirts of the city on January 3 are yet to get clearance from the   for their journey back home. Most of the minors hail from Odisha. 

  Incidentally, cops had on Friday night arrested 11 persons for employing the children at these kilns. They will soon be produced before a court for further action.
 
 "All the accused persons are owners of brick kilns in the Pedda Konduru and  . Initially, the owners had employed the parents of these kids but since there are no schools in the vicinity, the parents brought the children to work following which the minors too were employed," said Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat.
 
 Around 155 of the children who were rescued are below 13 years of age and 35 between the age of 13 to 18. 
 
 "We have contacted the women and child welfare department of Odisha. Now, they are contemplating whether to take the children back to their home state or leave them in the city," Bhagwat said. 
 
 All the children who were earlier sent to a government home, have been returned to their parents. 
 
 "Labour department officials also accompanied us during the rescue conducted under 'Operation Smile'. The labour department officials are of the view that it was best that the children stay with their parents instead of a home," he added. 
 
 In an earlier instance, police rescued 48 teenagers including 31 girls and 17 boys working as labourers at a sweet-making unit in Mailaradevapally area.
