GURUGRAM: A home guard, manning the traffic near city’s Jharsa Chowk, was arrested for taking bribe from a taxi driver on Friday. Police said an official, who happened to be a member of the chief minister’s flying squad against graft, was incidentally traveling in the same taxi and made a video with his mobile phone of Mahesh Kumar (26) accepting Rs 200 from the driver.

 Mahesh of Aata village, Sohna, was produced in a city court, which remanded him in judicial custody, on Saturday.
 
 Taxi driver Madan Singh said the home guard intercepted his cab near Jharsa Chowk around 5pm when he was transporting an official. Mahesh asked him to produce his driving licence and other documents related to the vehicle. “I produced all the documents, yet the home guard demanded Rs 500. Finally, he settled for Rs 200. My passenger made a video of the same and called the civil line police,” he said.
 
 Soon, a police team reached the spot and took the home guard in custody.
