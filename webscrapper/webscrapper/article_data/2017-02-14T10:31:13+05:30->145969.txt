BELAGAVI: State   chairman   has slapped a penalty of Rs  ,000 on VN Karekar, town planning officer in   (Buda), presently serving at Hubballi Dharawad Urban Development Authority in the same position, on the grounds of negligence and malafide intention of not sharing information under the Right to Information Act.

  At a public hearing at the deputy commissioner’s office, Justice Patil observed that the designated information officer of the Buda had not the shared the information even after three years, which indicates dereliction of duty and malafide intention not to share the information with the public.
 
 Advocate Nagappa Sogalad who sought information on the eligibility criteria of appointment of members for Buda was not provided the information since past three years. In this connection, the state commission also instructed Buda to provide information in accordance with the Act in 2014. Observing gross negligence on the part of VN Karekar, the state commission chief imposed a penalty under Section 27 of the Act which should be remitted within 10 days.
 
 In another case, a show-cause notice will be served to BG Mujawar, retired assistant sub inspector attached to Hirebagewadi police station, as he had provided wrong information to the applicant. Chairman Shankar Patil said that of 31 cases, 15 were disposed of and the remaining cases were adjourned. Expressing concern at the number of applications with the commission, he said that the public as well as government officers have failed to understand the act. “Often people come with grievance applications on which the commission doesn’t have authority to act,” he said.
