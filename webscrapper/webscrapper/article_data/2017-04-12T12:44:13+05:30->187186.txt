JALANDHAR:   Kaur has finally broken her self-imposed radio silence, giving insight into her mental state 
  for saying that war had killed her father, not Pakistan, and for challenging  .

 The   student has written a blog with the concluding remarks, “My father is a martyr. I am his daughter. But, I am not your ‘Martyr’s Daughter’,” indicating that she was holding on to her beliefs.
 
 The blog which Gurmehar posted on her Twitter handle with more than 54,000 followers, says that she could have answered the question: “Who am I?” without any inhibitions or wariness till a few weeks ago, but now she was not so sure.
 
 
 
 
 “That girl you saw flashing all over your television screens, holding a placard in hand, eyebrows raised, gaze fixed at the tiny round lens of a cellphone camera, definitely looked like me. The intensity of her thoughts that reflected in the picture definitely had traces of me. 
 
 She looked fiery, I relate to that, but then the ‘Breaking news headlines’ told a different story. The headlines were not me,” the moving post says.
 
 “I‘m my father’s daughter. I am my Papa’s Gulgul. I’m his doll. I am 2-year old artist who did not understand words but understood stick figures, which he drew in letters addressed to me. I‘m my mother’s headache, her opinionated, reckless, moody child - a reflection of her”, she states.
 
 She adds, “I’m an idealist. An athlete, a peacenik, I’m not your angry, vindictive war-mongering bechari you hoped me to be. I don’t want war because I know its price; it’s very expensive. Trust me, I know better because I’ve paid it every day.”
