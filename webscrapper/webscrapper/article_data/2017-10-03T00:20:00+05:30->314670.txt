Tirupur: Urging people to use khadi products, collector KS Palanisamy said Rs 326.62 lakh-worth khadi and polyester fabrics were produced in 11 khadi manufacturing units in the district in the last financial year.

 “It provided employment to 371 labourers directly and indirectly. They were able to earn Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 a week as wages. Those fabric manufacturing units were fed by 20 grama yarn making units, which produced khadi and polyester yarns worth of Rs 154.21 lakh. The units employed 571 woman,” he said.
 
 Five khadi Kraft shops in the district achieved the last year’s target of Rs 183 lakh, the collector said. “Government employees enjoy special discounts at the shops. They can also pay in eight instalments. Ahead of the Deepavali festival, khadi Kraft shops and five temporary allied shops have announced discount offers. If more people buy khadi products, handloom weavers will benefit,” he said.
 
 The collector also attended a grama sabha meeting conducted in Kottamangalam in Kudimangalam Panchayat union.
