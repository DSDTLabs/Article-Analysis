 "I always wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Batman. It's funny, I think we were just sort of out of time with our idea. I understood that (with) comics, that there's room for all different types of titles, but I think   at that time was still kind of in the Golden Age of comics, and they were still just doing the classic titles in classic ways," Aronofsky said. 
 
 The directors take was loosely based on  's ' ', and he even brought Miller on to co-write the script.
