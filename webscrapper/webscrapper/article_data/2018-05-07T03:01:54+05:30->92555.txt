GHAZIABAD: An FIR was registered against a company owner in Vijay Nagar police station on Saturday for selling ‘fake’ cyptocurrency to a resident of Crossings Republik.

 Dinesh Kumar, a resident of GH 7 society, alleged that one an acquaintance, Manish Kasana, had given him an offer to invest money in ‘Lite Coin Classic” which had been developed by his Sahibabad-based company on the lines of Bitcoin.
 
 Kumar claimed that he along with his friends invested lakhs of rupees in this scheme, but never got his money back.
 
 “Kasana told me that if I invested in this scheme, I will get 100 times profit in the coming days. I transferred lakhs of rupees in parts. On September 16 last year, I made the last transaction and transferred Rs 15,000 online to Kasana’s company account using my wife’s debit card. Later when I tried to contact Kasana, I found his phone switched off. Finding it suspicious, I went to his office in  , but found it locked. An inquiry revealed that hundreds of people had been making rounds to his office for past many days, but to no avail. Moreover, a website of the company had also been taken down since then,” Kumar told TOI.
 
 Kumar added that in the past several months, he has made several rounds of offices of senior police officials, but could not get an FIR registered in the case. “It happened only after I met SSP Vaibhav Krishna on May 2 with an application. Going through my plight, he ordered that an FIR be registered in the case,” he said. 
 
 Consequently, an FIR was lodged on May 5 against Kasana under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC.
 
 A police officer said that the case was registered on the instructions of the SSP.
