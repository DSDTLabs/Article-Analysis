NEW DELHI: Senior   on Monday gave a   chaired by transport minister   a miss, following the resolution of the bureaucrats to   all meetings called by city ministers. The focus of the meeting was to discuss and finalise a comprehensive   for the capital.

 The meeting was attended largely by academicians and experts from organisations and think tanks working on road safety and sustainable transportation.
 
 “There was no question of attending the meeting. However, since it was an important meeting and many crucial decisions were taken in the last meeting of the Delhi Road Safety Council, all necessary policy documents, reports and details of concrete action taken on previous decision were sent for the meeting,” said a senior transport department official.
 
 As per the directions issued by the Supreme Court, the Road Safety Council of each state has to mandatorily meet at least twice a year. Monday saw the first meeting of Delhi’s Road Safety Council in the year 2018.
 
 The aim of the Road Safety Policy is to prevent, reduce and check road injuries and fatalities on various roads of Delhi in coordination with all stakeholders and government agencies. Delhi figures as among the most unsafe cities in India for road users.
 
 According to a statement from the government, a key suggestion recommended by several members at the meeting, including academic experts from IIT Delhi and School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), was to strengthen the Road Safety Cell in the Transport department so that it becomes capable of conducting scientific crash investigations and using rigorous data to identify the root causes behind road crashes.
 
 It was also decided at the meeting to adopt   guidelines to ensure District Road Safety Committees in Delhi, which are headed by the respective District Magistrates, meet regularly and are able to efficiently discharge their duties, the statement said.
