MUMBAI: The   will procure driverless trains that will run along the 33.5km underground metro corridor on the   route, also known as Metro III.

 The metro rail agency has plans to open the Metro system for passengers in phases from 2020.
 
 Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation's director (systems), AA Bhatt, said that the driverless train will be equipped with latest technology prevalent across the world. “It will have driverless features besides communication-based train control system.“
 
 Initially, for a year, the train will operate with the help of a pilot, but these pilots will gradually be done away with.
 
 The communication-based train control system or cab-signalling works on digital technology . The train receives a signal in the cab about the speed and location of the train and braking distance. This results in trains moving closer behind each other, while also taking into account the safety buffer between two trains. Such a system will allow the authorities to run more trains at lesser intervals. In other words, this will be a boon for commuters as the frequency of metro trains will increase.
 
 Currently , driverless technology is in use in 27 countries. The Delhi Metro has also got approvals to run drivers less trains.
