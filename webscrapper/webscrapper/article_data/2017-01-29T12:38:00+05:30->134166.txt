Rohtak: A day before an avalanche hit an Indian Army camp in Kashmir, killing 10 soldiers, including Ankur Sharma from Jhajjar district, the latter had spoken to his father Jai Bhagwan, a retired soldier, on phone but could not talk to his mother. “It is the last memory I have of my son Ankur (23), who spoke to me on January 25 and wished to speak to his mother Savita, but couldn’t do so as I was out of village,” he said.

 Bhagwan, who retired as Naik from the Army, said Ankur joined the forces in 2012, and spent a month on Diwali last year at their native Ukalchana village in Jhajjar district. He was excited about his promotion, which was due after some months, he said. The family said that they were looking forward to some memorable time on the second marriage anniversary of their son on February 10, but all had been lost now. On who broke the tragic news to them, Bhagwan said a senior officer from Ankur’s battalion called up on Thursday night and informed them about the mishap. 
 
 Anukur’s younger brother Rinku Sharma, who recently cleared physical and medical test for recruitment to the Army, said donning the olive green uniform was the only thing both brothers had dreamt since childhood. “My brother used to share his experiences and was my source of inspiration to move ahead,” Rinku said. Re-affirming his decision, he said nothing could deter him from the joining the Army and was still determined to realise his dream.
 
 On the cremation of the martyred soldier, Bhagwan told TOI that owing to continuous snowfall in Kashmir a chopper could not fly. He added that they had been informed that the mortal remains of Ankur would reach here by Sunday.
 
 Meanwhile, Ukalchana sarpanch Sunder Ram said the village would build a memorial in the memory of the martyr near the government school and he would be cremated there.
