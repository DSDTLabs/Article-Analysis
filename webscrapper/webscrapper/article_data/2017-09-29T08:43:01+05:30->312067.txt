LUCKNOW: Three days after   patriarch   announced that he will not attend the party's national convention in Agra on October 5, party chief   visited him at his residence on Thursday morning.

 In the ab sence of any official confirmation on what actually transpired at the meeting that lasted around 25 minutes, speculations were rife that Akhilesh had gone to formally invite Mulayam for the convention. Party sources said that Mulayam, while talking to a senior party leader recently, had expressed his displeasure over the fact that Akhilesh hadn't met him for months. “He hasn't met me for three months now,“ Mulayam reportedly told the party leader, who is close to both father and son.
 
 The senior leader in question then persuaded Akhilesh to meet the party founder. The two have not been on good terms since the bit ter battle for control over the party in September 2016. During the closed-door meeting, Mulayam is believed to have remained non-committal about attending the party's national convention. Mulayam and his brother Shivpal Yadav were not invited to the SP's state convention held in Lucknow on September 23.
