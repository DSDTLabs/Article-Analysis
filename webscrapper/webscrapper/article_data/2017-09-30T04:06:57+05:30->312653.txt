Mumbai: Barely a week after BMC demolished   at   in   (W), many of the shops   the illegal sheds. On Friday, the civic demolition squad razed the extensions again.

 “Our team found that the stalls had rebuilt the sheds despite our action last week. So, we razed them again,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, H-West ward. Officials said encroachment was one of the major causes for congestion on Pali Naka Road and junction and Ambedkar Road.
 
 Ughade said they have decided to serve notices to the errant stall owners. “It is a 40ft wide road, but then owing to the illegal extensions by most shops, it has reduced to barely 20ft,” he said.
