MYSURU: A day after former CM B S Yeddyurappa’s son B Y Vijayendra soft-launched his campaign from   segment, CM Siddaramaiah’s son  , who is seeking to defend his father’s bastion for the Congress, held roadshows in parts of Nanjangud taluk.

 Yathindra offered prayers at Ramalingeshwara temple before he officially launched the campaign at Rampura, near Tagaduru, in Nanjangud. “My father visits Ramalingeshwara temple before starting his campaign, and I am following this tradition,” he told reporters, adding that he is banking on his 18-month association with the villagers, and his father’s governance to help him in his mission.
 
 Asserting that it is not his first visit to villages dotting the segment, which is spread over Mysuru, Nanjangud and T Narsipur taluks, the Congress aspirant said: “I’ve visited the villages 2-3 times in the past 18 months, and have brought money for development projects from the government. It is for the people to decide whom to elect but they are clearly happy with the efficient and stable government which is pro-people.”
 
 He sought to downplay the BJP’s strategy to field Vijayendra, and basic facilities, and wants to achieve 100% literacy. He said unemployment is an issue in the constituency. He toured Gowdanahundi, Alahya, Kembal, Bidaragadu and Hallikerehundi and addressed meetings.
