BENGALURU: More than 20,000   from city police and   (CAPF) will be on security duty on Saturday to ensure voting in the city goes of smoothly.   have been made for 1,200 polling stations which have been identified as critical and 324 vulnerable booths across city. These booths will be manned by   (CAR) personnel.

 T Suneel Kumar, city police commissioner, suggested every security loophole the top brass can think of is being plugged. “The entire city police force, which is about 16,000 personnel, will be on duty alongside 44 different companies of CAPF like Central Reserve Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Border Security Force and others,” Kumar said. “Cluster booths of 15 to 20 stations will be manned by 400 police vehicles, which will have sub-inspectors and armed constables. These vans will be supervised by 105 mobile units.”
 
 Kumar revealed the entire security arrangements will be reviewed and overseen by 16 DCPs and ACPs. The police are also not taking chances with arms in possession of private individuals. Of the 8,096 licensed arms holders in the city, Kumar revealed about 7,500 have surrendered their weapons to local jurisdictional stations. “The remaining are either commissioned to state or central government employees,” he said.
