KOZHIKODE: The rise of the mercury level has prompted the motor vehicle department to consider a revision of its already fixed driving test schedules in the district. The revised schedule is in force from Wednesday.

 The motor vehicle department has also revised the time schedule for fitness test of vehicles. The move aims to protect the motorists, driving learners and the personnel with the motor vehicle department from sun stroke and related health issues.
 
 “Mercury level is so high this time and we want to prevent sun stroke during driving test and other activities,” said regional transport officer  . A couple of sun stroke cases have already been reported from the district and we do not want the public and the officials to be hit by the heat, he added.
 
 Though the motor vehicle department had introduced a   special schedule for driving test and other tests the last year also, the summer timetable came into force a bit early this time taking into account the rise in the mercury level. Last year the time shift was introduced only in April.
 
 As per the revised schedule, vehicle owners requiring certificate of fitness (CF) for their vehicle can reach the driving test ground at   at 8.30 am. The CF test will end by 10.30 am.
 
 Driving test for motor driving license aspirants will begin at 7.15 am as per the revised schedule. The aim is to wind up the ground and road test by 12.30 pm. Owing to the increased number of candidates for driving test; many have to wait for hours in the open at the driving test ground for test.
 
 Regional transport offices in   and a few other places have been implementing the practice for over a couple of years. This time we received a direction from the head office regarding the shift in the time schedule, said  . The revised time schedule will be in force till the end of May, he added.
