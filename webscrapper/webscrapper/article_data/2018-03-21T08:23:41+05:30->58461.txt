CHENNAI: Doctors at a city hospital say they can bring patients back to life, even an hour after their hearts stop, with the help of trained staff and the right equipment. 

 "A cardiac arrest is the same as death. The heart has to stop for doctors to declare death. But in many cases we have been able to reverse it before too much cell damage," said a heart transplant surgeon in  .
 
 The critical care team here has revived 13 of the 19 critically ill patients who suffered cardiac arrest in the hospital, he said. Some patient's hearts picked up nearly 75 minutes after cardiac arrest, he said.
 
 The hospital has added extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to its routine cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) process. ECMO is a system in which blood from a person who has had a cardiac arrest is taken and circulated through a membrane oxygenator, which supplies oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood is put back into circulation. 
 
 "The machine is now part of our crash cart that's dragged out when the patient has a cardiac arrest," said head of critical care Dr  .
