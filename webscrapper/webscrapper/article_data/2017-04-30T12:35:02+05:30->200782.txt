LUCKNOW: Class XII students of   board ( ) examinations can expect a shorter examination schedule. Adhering to chief minister  's instructions, the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education department will curtail the number of examination days, by almost half. This is possible only when the board cuts down on the number of papers. So far, there are two papers - paper I and paper II - of each subject in class XII and it takes about 40 days to hold examinations for all subjects. 

 During the secondary education department's presentation, Yogi had expressed reservations over month-long examinations. The CM had asked officials to ensure the Intermediate (class XII) examinations end within 15 days just like the high school (class X) exam. The arrangement, if passed by the board, will be implemented from the next academic session, 2018-19. The move will save both time and resources of the board.
 
 UP Board secretary   told TOI that the proposal was tabled before the full board meeting, held recently. "It is at a discussion level. There will be cuts in the number of papers for short examination schedule but the final decision has yet to be taken,'' Yadav said.
