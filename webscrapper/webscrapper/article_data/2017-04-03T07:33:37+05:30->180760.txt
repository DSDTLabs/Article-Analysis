 Dr  , an Ayurvedic doctor from Buhari in Vyara, who is an avid wildlife photographer, was at the holy land of adivasis at Govaldev in Kanjan village near Vyara when he spotted masked shrike.
 
 Dr Bharti told TOI, “I saw this bird resting on a branch of a tree. I have captured so many birds in this area, but this was something rare and which I had never seen before. I immediately started clicking shots of this rare little bird, without knowing what species it was.” 
 
 He returned from Govaldev and engrossed himself in finding about the species of this rare bird that he saw there. He searched on internet and also went through a book titled ‘Birds of India’. He then contacted the forest department officials, who were awestruck on seeing the pictures of this rare bird. They said this species of bird was not from this area.
 
 Dr Bharti also contacted experts from Birds Society of India (BSI), who matched his pictures of the bird with their database, only to find that it was masked shrike, that breeds in  , Greece, Turkey, Cyprus,   and Israel. 
 
 The male has mainly black upperparts, with white on its crown, forehead and super cilium and large white patches on the shoulders and wings.

The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts. 
 
 “The bird was spotted till last month, but now I could not see it. It seems, the bird has migrated to its home in Europe,” Dr Bharti added.
