Trichy: The state government must allow jallikattu in the state even if Supreme Court imposes a ban on it, said MDMK leader   here. Speaking on the sidelines of a party meeting, he said that the Supreme Court had done nothing when Karnataka didn’t release Cauvery water even after its verdict. Neither did it make Kerala obey its order in the Mullaiperiyar row. 

 He said the state government should come forward to support jallikattu without fearing the Supreme Court. Vaiko also sought action against   personnel who attacked students in Chennai during the Marina protest in support of jallikattu. “Action has to be initiated against police personnel who fuelled riot in Chennai so as to restore faith among the people in the force,” said Vaiko while seeking explanation from chief minister O Paneerselvam on the video evidence of police personnel torching vehicles in public places. Lauding their peaceful protest, , he urged the youth to take up issues like total prohibition and Cauvery in future.
