NEW DELHI:   is in Moscow to discuss with Russian authorities issues related to security and counter-terrorism, government officials said on Monday. Doval held talks on Monday with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, a key aide of President  . 

 The two sides are expected to review the entire gamut of their security partnership during the talks. The impact of Trump presidency on global geopolitics and the perception in India that Russia is making a futile attempt to 
  is also likely to be addressed during the talks. 
 
 According to an agency report, Moscow will take up with Doval the issue of delay in implementing defence deals. The report quoted sources to say that Russia is upset over the fact that despite the signing of an inter-governmental deal over a year ago, there had been no progress from the Indian side on the issue of purchase of the twin-engined 200 Kamov Ka-226 utility choppers. 
 
 “The proposal is over a year old. The agreement was firmed up during the summit meet between our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and President (Vladimir) Putin in Goa last October.   Limited is to hold a majority stake in the venture that will execute the project,” it said quoting a source. “But they (Hindustan Aeronautics) see a conflict of interest,” it added, referring to the Indian state-owned compan’s own light utility helicopter programme. 
 
 The Ka-226 deal was a major component of defence pacts worth $10 billion signed between India and Russia during the October 2015 summit. India confirmed to buy 200 choppers of which 60 were to be fly-away, another 60 as knock-down units and the balance 
  . The Ka-226s were to replace India’s aging fleet of Cheetah and Chetak choppers. 
 
 As regards the proposed new Indian entity, while Hindustan Aeronautics is to hold 50.5 per cent stake in the joint venture, Russian entities — RH and ROE — are to own the remaining 49.5% equity.
