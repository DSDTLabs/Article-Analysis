Ajmer: A French tourist died on Friday after she was hit by the back wheel of the bus while getting down from the vehicle in Pushkar.

 The 74-year-old tourist has been identified as Sabine Elisabeth Marie, who was part of a group from New Delhi visiting Pushkar. When she was getting down from the bus, the driver started the vehicle thinking all had got down from the vehicle.
 
 Marie slipped and was hit by the back wheel. She was rushed to the government hospital by others, who thought she had only fractured her left ankle. She was referred to Ajmer’s JLN Hospital where she died while undergoing treatment.
 
 According to police, she was part of a16-member French group, who had made pre-booked their stay. The accident happened when the bus stopped outside the hotel at noon and the tourists began stepping down. Marie was the last to get down.
 
 Doctors suspect that the death may have been caused by the trauma she suffered. Police are investigating the carelessness of the driver. “An autopsy will be conducted as soon as we get permission. That will ascertain the cause of death,” said the police. Police have registered a case and informed the French embassy.
