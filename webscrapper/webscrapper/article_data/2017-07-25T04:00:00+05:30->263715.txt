Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will start Blue Express Bus Service on the Surat-Kamrej corridor from July 25 to meet the ever-rising passenger load. Demand for public transport on this route is huge. 

 At least 12 blue-coloured buses will ferry passengers on this corridor. These buses will halt only at seven bus stops and run on eight-minute frequency during peak morning and evening hours. SMC has been earning handsome revenue from its bus service on this route that was started six months ago. 
 
 An SMC officer said, “Surat station-Kamrej route is most busy. Over 22,000 passengers travel on this route daily. This number will rise once more buses are provided for the route. We have decided to run Blue Express Bus Service on this corridor and will start with 12 buses. The bus stops are SMC Varaccha Health Centre, Central Warehouse, Mangadh Chowk, Baroda Pristage, Vallabhacharya Chowk, DGVCL House Urja Sadan and Sarthana Nature Park.”
 
 At present, Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) has been operationalized on nine corridors. At least 120 BRTS buses ply on 102km road network while 187 city buses cover a distance of 285km on 23 routes. The combined ridership of BRTS and city buses is pegged at 85,000 passengers and 55,000 passengers per day, respectively.
