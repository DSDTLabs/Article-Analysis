JAIPUR: The famous   organised at the   area of Luniawas village on the city outskirts may be losing its sheen even though the donkey sellers are leaving no stones unturned to invite the buyers. 

 Traders said that in the past couple of years the annual donkey fair is witnessing political ignorance. For the past three years the organisers have not been able to get a chief guest for the fair, hence they are using names of Bollywood actors and even of  , the adopted daughter of Dera’s chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim.
 
 Like the Pushkar Fair which is famous for the sale and purchase of camels, the donkey fair of Jaipur has been organised for the last 20 years and had hogged headlines. However, in the last couple of years since political leaders are not visiting it anymore, the craze has gone down.
 
 However, for the buyers the donkeys named as Bollywood actors varying from Salman Khan to   has proved to be profitable. “The jack named Salman Khan was auctioned for Rs 5,000 while the female donkey named Honeypreet is costlier compared to other female donkeys named Kareena and Katrina,” said an organiser.
 
 Organisers added that since 1992 the village has been organising donkey fair and   gives various facilities to the donkey traders. “It was supposed to be on for a week, however, it had to be stopped in between,” said Sujan Singh a villager.
 
 Villagers alleged that JMC organises for stage, light and water for the buyers and sellers coming to the fair.
 
 It may be recalled that hundreds of traders and farmers flock the annual donkey fair which was earlier claimed to be Asia’s largest.
