PUNE: A 25-year-old man went on an alcohol-fuelled arson rampage in the wee hours of Sunday, reducing 30 vehicles to mere smoking husks. The incident took place near lane 38 of the   slum near Parvati.

 Jabya Hari Patil aka Nilesh (25), who lives in lane 38, was arrested under sections 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal code. He was produced in court on Sunday and remanded in judicial custody.
 
 Police said Patil has confessed to the crime and are ascertaining the reason behind the rampage. Hement Devgharkar, a resident of lane 38, told TOI that the fire broke out around 2am. Someone noticed a burning motorcycle parked in front of a public toilet, a stone's throw away from the Janata Vasahat police chowkey. “I rushed out and saw that several motorcycles parked in the same spot had caught fire,“ Devgharkar said.  's motorcycle too was set ablaze, but he could not do anything about it. “Fire tenders rushed to the spot and doused the fire,“ he said.
 
 A three-wheeler tempo pickup, 27 mo torcycles and two bicycles were destroyed in the incident.
 
 Janata Vasahat, one of the biggest slums in Pune, comprises 118 mostly narrow lanes. The 1 lakh-odd residents of the slum park their vehicles along the main road. Most of destroyed vehicles belonged to labourers, who had purchased them after taking loans. Barring one or two, none had renewed their vehicle insurance. The total estimated damage is Rs 4 lakh.
 
 The damaged vehicles had very little fuel in their tanks. It could have been catastrophic otherwise, police said. Senior inspector   of the Dat tawadi police station led a team who captured Patil before he could escape the city. The police found a matchbox on him.“His clothes smelled of petrol,“ said police sub-inspector  , who is probing the case.
