NEW DELHI: Fearing terrorists may target Indian hydro projects at the strategic   river basin, the Centre has asked the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to take over the security of   hydroelectric project at the LoC.

 According to senior sources in the home ministry, a joint security survey of the 330MW Kishanganga project is presently being carried out by CISF, intelligence bureau (IB) and representatives of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) to ascertain how many CISF commandos need to be deployed there.
 
 Sources said MHA, in consultation with the defence ministry, decided to hand over the security of Kishanganga after IB suggested that terrorists may target the dam or hydroelectric power generation structure/equipments there.
 
 CISF has expertise in guarding nuclear installations, airports, power plants, VIPs, private institutions, Delhi Metro and heritage buildings.
 
 The under-construction project has been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan with the latter alleging that India’s construction of a dam on Kishanganga, a tributary of Jhelum, will impact water flow on the Pakistan side. Pakistan had also gone to the International Court of Arbitration at the Hague in 2013 but the court ruled in India’s favour stating it has a right to build the dam and divert water from Kishanganga.
 
 Following a series of Paksponsored terror attacks, including at Pathankot and Uri, PM   had decided to suspend the meeting of the Indus Water Commission. Pakistan had also approached the World Bank last year seeking an arbitration following which the bank decided to set up a court of arbitration and appoint a neutral expert, which was not acceptable to the Modi government.
 
 The project construction has also been affected in the last year due to continuous protests in Kashmir Valley, MHA sources said.
