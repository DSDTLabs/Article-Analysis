“What appealed to me was the subject — it is very a good and is not a serious detective story. It is packed with comedy and fun. Also, it has been long since a film in this genre has been made,” says Rishab. 
 The actor-filmmaker is also working on getting a new look that will be in sync with the time period that the film is set in.
