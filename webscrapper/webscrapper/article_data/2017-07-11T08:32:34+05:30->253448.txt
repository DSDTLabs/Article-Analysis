JAIPUR: The first-of-its-kind   at   in Rajasthan is meant to   for conducting   on  . In the last 16 years, the department has seen 4  . It is being handled by a single teacher since inception indicating that consecutive governments have never made any efforts to make the best use of this exclusive department. 

 Laxmi Thakur, head of department, population studies, says that course is of international standard but due to lack of awareness among students, it is not finding takers. "This course was introduced in 2001 with an aim to produce professional demographers who could help the government and non-government agencies in planning policies and programmes," said Thakur, who is also head of department of Masters in Social Work course.
 
 The worst part is that this course has one teacher. The structure of course is such that it requires guest faculties from different subjects who could make students understand the importance of demographic changes from different point of view. The department is also struggling for resources as it doesn't have access to reputed e-journals which are required for the students.
 
 The admission in department is also very easy. The total seats are 20 and rarely all seats get filled. Thakur has confessed that rarely they see a class with 100% attendance. "We get students of all types, some are serious while others are not. The subject is purely based on conducting surveys and research work," said Thakur.
