AURANGABAD: The civic body’s proposed new administrative   on a 5.5-acre land in   in the city’s heart may soon become a reality. 

 The land belongs to a private party and was acquired by the civic body around 20 years ago. However, a dispute arose between the   ( ) and land owners. Now, sources told TOI that the land owner has expressed willingness to settle the dispute. A proposal in this regard may come up before the standing committee meeting soon.
 
 On Monday, standing committee chairman Mohan Meghawale said he would bring up the issue at the upcoming meeting and direct the AMC to hold talks with the property owner.
 
 Meghawale said the west Aurangabad MLA Sanjay Shirsat and office bearers of the civic body are stepping up efforts to settle the land dispute. 
 
 “We hope to see a new building at the spot soon. Apart from this, the new building would enable the authorities to use the existing administrative blocks for a proposed multispecialty hospital,” he said.
 
 The civic body has been on the lookout for a suitable piece of land for the hospital.
 
 A senior AMC officer said the administration had initiated land acquisition process sometime in 1995-96. 
 
 “The civic body agreed to pay a particular amount to the property owner and funds were offered to him. But, the owner refused to accept the funds and wanted to renegotiate the land cost. The proposal has been pending since then,” he said.
 
 The AMC has been planning to build a new building at the spot considering its strategic location. The plot is in the heart of the city with enough space for parking, open space and further expansion of the office premises. 
 
 On the other hand, the existing two administrative blocks of the AMC are located in the congested   area with very little space for parking. Most of the streets leading to the building are also quite narrow.
