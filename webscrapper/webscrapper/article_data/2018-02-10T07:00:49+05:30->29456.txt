NAGPUR: A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped twice in a week by a 52-year-old neighbour,  , at his house. The survivor’s mother lodged a complaint on Thursday at   police station.

 The accused was arrested and charged with offences under IPC and also under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The girl was taken to   for medical examination.
 
 PI   told TOI, “During the first incident, Mathunkar, an unemployed man, had lured the girl with chocolate while she was playing with other children in front of his house. He took her inside the house when his wife, two sons and their wives had gone out for work.”
 
 Cops said Mathunkar forced her to undress and performed the sexual acts with her. The girl started crying but he didn’t release her. After the incident, the girl had stopped playing with friends for a week, but didn’t tell anyone about the episode.
 
 A week later, when she dared to venture out to play, Mathunkar again took her inside and repeated the objectionable acts. This time, the girl managed to escape and rushed to her home. She narrated the episode to her mother, who informed her husband.
 
 The survivor’s parents, both labourers, had an argument with Mathunkar where he denied the incident, following which the couple registered a complaint. Mathunkar was arrested and sent to custody.
