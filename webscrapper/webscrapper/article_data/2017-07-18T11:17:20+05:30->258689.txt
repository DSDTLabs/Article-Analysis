NEW DELHI:   surpas sed Hero Moto-Corp in scooter sales in the fiscal first quarter, growing at more than 35 per cent when the segment volume at the two-wheeler market leader fell marginally.
 
  The local two-wheeler unit of   Motor still perched atop the scooter market with a lead that was nearly three times TVS Motor’s sales in the April-June period.
  
  Chennai-based TVS Motor sold 2,49,077 units in the past quarter to become the second largest scooter seller in the Indian market, showed data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
  
    sold 2,09,790 units to come next, while Honda Motorcycle & Scooter topped the list with volume of 9,73,725 scooters. Among major manufactures, only   Motorcycles grew faster — at over 58 per cent year-on-year to 89,323 units — but on a smaller base.
  
  At Honda, sales expanded more than 25 per cent. “To keep the growth momentum going, we have exciting plans lined up in the scooter segment,” Aniruddha Haldar, TVS Motor’s vice president for marketing (scooters), said, citing the new colours the company launched and its plan to introduce an all-new scooter this fiscal year.
  
  Hero MotoCorp didn’t respond until press time on Monday to an email seeking comment on the fall in its scooter volume. Mahindra Two Wheelers was the only other company that posted a drop in scooter sales in the first three months of fiscal 2018.
  
  At Mahindra Two Wheelers, the fall was steep at 80 per cent, with it selling just 2,727 scooters in the past quarter. At Piaggio Vehicles, which operates largely in the premium scooter segment, sales grew almost 91 per cent to 13,572 units.
  
  “Today, one in every three twowheelers on the road is a scooter. The Indian urban two-wheeler market is going through a phase of transformation,” Haldar said.
