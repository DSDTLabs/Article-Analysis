BENGALURU: Trouble continues to brew in Visvesvaraya Technological University over transition of students to the newly introduced assessment system. 

 Under the new choice-based credit system (CBCS), students are assigned grades and not marks. The   was introduced for the 2015 batch and the varsity announced a one-time exit scheme for non-CBCS students, under which students who failed were not to be retained. The exit scheme benefited 20,000 non-CBCS VTU students.
 
 While students of the 2014 batch, who were not eligible to get into the next year, were shifted to the CBCS scheme, those who failed in the second year were retained under non-CBCS. 
 
 Last week, CBCS students of a Davanagere college moved the Karnataka high court against the one-time exit scheme. Non-CBCS students benefited by the exit scheme are now planning to approach the court next, seeking extension of the scheme to eligible students. 
 
 
 
  "We will register a petition in the high court on Tuesday, seeking all eligible students should be given the benefit of university's one-time exit scheme as their future depends on it. All eligible candidates should be allowed to attend the classes further," demanded members of VTU students' struggle committee, which comprises non-CBCS students. 
 
 The committee had earlier held a month-long protest against the university seeking the exit scheme, as they had to write continuous exams in a very short period due to discrepancies in VTU examination system.
 
 "This mess is has been created due to VTU's random decisions. I hope knocking doors of the high court will help all eligible students," said Shravan, a member of the students' struggle committee.
 
 VTU vice chancellor Karisiddappa was not available for comments.
