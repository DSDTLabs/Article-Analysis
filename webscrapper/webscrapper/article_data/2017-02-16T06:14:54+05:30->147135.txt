AHMEDABAD: The   ( ) has not been able to persuade schools to open their playgrounds for public use during non-working hours, but it plans to build walls to secure its open spaces from “future encroachment”. 

 In its annual budget declared on Wednesday, the apex planning body of Ahmedabad allocated Rs 8.8 crore to implement the project.
 
  As for the playgrounds, they are Auda properties that have been allotted to schools on the condition that the schools share them with public at specified time slots.  , the chairman of Auda, said: “We have taken necessary steps like putting up boards stating the time slots when the general public can use the grounds. This was done to avert tussles between the public and school authorities.” A petition has been filed in the high court recently over the use of the playgrounds. “We will comply with all the guidelines issued by the court,”   said.
 
 Interestingly, a number of Auda plots remain encroached upon by shanties and commercial properties. Auda in 2013 drew up a decadal growth plan for the city. But of the Rs 474 crore allocated in the last financial year, Auda could spend only Rs 175 crore, of which close to Rs 70 lakh was for institutional expenses. A number of urban growth centres around Ahmedabad city are crying for basic infrastructure such as roads and drainage.
