PATNA: Bihar CM   on Saturday inducted into his cabinet 27 ministers, including 14 from JD(U) and 12 from BJP.

 LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan’s brother  , who is not a member of the state legislature, was also administered oath at   while the other smaller NDA allies, RLSP and HAM (S), remained unrepresented in the cabinet.
 
 With Nitish and his deputy   taking oath on Thursday, the strength of the state cabinet has now gone up to 29. 
 
 While Nitish has retained home, general administration, vigilance and public relations departments, Modi will hold finance, commercial taxes, environment and forests and information technology portfolios.
 
 BJP functionary and newly inducted minister Nand Kishore Yadav said six more ministers would be sworn in later.
 
 “As per the decision on distribution of ministerial berths, 19 will be from JD(U) quota and 16 from BJP-LJP-RLSP-HAM(S) combine,” Yadav said.
 
 Asked about non-representation, RLSP’s state unit secretary general Satyanand Prasad Dangi said the party had given the name of its Harlakhi MLA   and NDA’s central committee approved it. “The state leadership perhaps thought otherwise,” he said.
 
 RLSP sources said Nitish was against taking Sudhanshu on board. HAM(S) president   expressed his unhappiness over LJP getting a berth in the ministry. Without taking Paras’ name, he said: “We had recommended the name of a party member, who is not a member of the legislature, but they rejected it.”
