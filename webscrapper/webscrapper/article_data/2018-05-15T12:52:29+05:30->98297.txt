THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Scientists in Kerala mourned the death of physicist   and termed him an unsung hero. They claimed that though his name was included in the list for   many times, luck did not favour him. Sudarshan was honoured with a Padma Bhushan in 2007 and Kerala Science Award in 2013. 

 Chief minister   offered his condolences and said that Sudarshan was a unique genius who set the foundations in the field of quantum optics. Though circumstances led to the denial of the Nobel Prize, he is remembered for his immense contribution to the world of science. CSIR-National Institute of Interdisciplinary Science and Technology director A Ajayaghosh and Kerala Science and Technology Museum director   termed his death as a big loss for the science community.
 
 Noted ecological scientist   said: “Sudarshan was an exceptional scientist in quantum optics with a positive outlook. He was gentle and a model teacher.”
 
 He was the first person to propose the existence of a hypothetical particle that moves faster than light that was later termed as Tachyons. Sudarshan had said in 2013 that even neutrinos, an electrically neutral elementary sub-atomic particle has only a half-integer spin and not zero spin. “Though the excitement continued for over a year on neutrinos possibility to travel faster than light, it’s yet to be proved and a billion-dollar experiment is on,” he had said.
 
 Though the Nobel committee conferred the award for his work in quantum optics, known as Sudarshan-Glauber representation in 2005, he was not given the award; while Roy J Glauber won his share of the prize. He had then said that though Indian scientists take the lead for their work, they are sidelined when it comes to recognition. He had said: “All the work based on my discovery won awards, though not me.”
