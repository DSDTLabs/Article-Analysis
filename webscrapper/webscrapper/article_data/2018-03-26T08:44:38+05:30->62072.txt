BHOPAL: Safety of girls and women in city is a matter of concern, claims the survivor who was traumatized by four men near a culvert between   station and   barely 50 metres away from an RPF police station for three hours on October 31. The 19-year-old UPSC aspirant is now getting back to normal life after the four accused were sentenced by a fast track court in  .

 Talking to TOI on Sunday she expressed shock and anguish over the gang rape of another student. She said police had made tall claims after her case and announced that the security of the coaching centres will be hiked up. Patrol parties were ordered to maintain vigil at such points. “I think police makes temporary commitments after any major incident comes to light. Sometime later when everybody forgets about it they too move on,” she said.
 
  
  
 Her mother talking to TOI said, “I told my daughter to forget the incident just as an accident. For four days, people show their concern for you and then they forget. So, it is the survivor who must become strong herself and face the realities of life. The state government had declared that such offenders will be given capital punishment. But, there is no progress on implementing the decision. Police is functioning under tremendous pressure. I should be called to the parade (juloos) of such offenders. I will give them such a treatment that they would remember for life.”
 
 DIG,   said, “Police is constantly maintaining a vigil at coaching centres and girl’s hostel in various parts of the city. Now, it will be intensified. In the recent case, with survivor and the accused   known to the girl it was not easy to anticipate the crime. Technically it is not a case of abduction but we registered a case as she reported and arrested the accused within hours. We will put up a strong case against the accused in court so that they get the harshest punishment.”
