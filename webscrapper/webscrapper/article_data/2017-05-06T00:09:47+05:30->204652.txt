Pune:   said it has scaled up its   ethanol technology at a cumulative investment of Rs 150-175 crore. The company said this investment was done through internal accruals and has vested over the last seven years.

 Using this technology, the process-solutions company said, refineries and its clients can produce energy from waste.
 
 “The second generation demo plant (near Pune) can produce one million litre of   per year by processing a variety of agri-residue like rice and wheat straw, cotton, bagasse, corn cobs & stover, etc,” the company said in a statement.
 
 One of the primary reasons why ethanol blending has been stuck below 4% is the unavailability of suitable raw materials, as the first generation plants were over-reliant on sugarcane residue.
 
 Using a variety of agri-residue, the ethanol blending programme can get more predictability.
 
 Praj Industries has signed MoUs with Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd to be their technology partners for certain projects.
 
  In the first phase, 10-12 second generation ethanol projects are being planned across the country, each at a capital expenditure of Rs 600 crore and average capacity to 100,000 litre of ethanol per day.
 
 The company hopes to get about 40% of the project cost as revenue to provide technology know-how and other services.
 
 Pramod Chaudhari, executive chairman, Praj Industries said this technology has great potential to boost to rural economy and create employment.
 
 “The menace caused by burning of farm residue can be addressed effectively by converting biomass into ethanol to be used as a transportation fuel,” said Chaudhari.
