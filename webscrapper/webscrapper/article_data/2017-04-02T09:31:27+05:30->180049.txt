CHANDIGARH: Punjab government on Saturday transferred as many as 42 senior and middle rank officers in districts and police headquarters, with the list bearing a clear stamp of   chief Suresh Arora.

 Incumbent ADGP(bureau of investigation) Iqbal Preet Sahota, a 1989-batch IPS has been replaced by Arora with Sahota's batchmate Prabodh Kumar. Like 1988-batch IPS Dinkar Gupta, who is perceived to be Arora's most bankable officer, was made intelligence wing chief, Kumar too was handpicked by Arora to head the BOI wing.
 
 Interestingly, Kumar was made head of most special investigation teams (SIT), including Pathankot terror attack, Nabha Jail break and attacks and assasinations of Hindu leaders, none of which have seen any big headway so far. Even as SITs headed by Kumar failed to deliver results, Sahota never enjoyed Arora's confidence
