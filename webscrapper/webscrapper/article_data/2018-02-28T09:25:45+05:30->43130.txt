BHOPAL:   is in the news again, this time for a theft at a rural branch in MP's Damoh district. The burglar, who hammered a hole in the wall to enter the bank, found only small change and made off with Rs 65,000 in chillar. Blurry CCTV footage of the bank shows one man committing the crime on Sunday night. The bank that was hit is in   village of   tehsil, some 60km from the district HQ. 

 Bank manager   told local media that since they were closed on the weekend, there was no cash in the bank and only Rs1 lakh in change. The robber took away Rs 65,000 in coins. Even if it were all in five-rupee and 10-rupee coins, the heap weight 40-45kg.
 
 A R Ahirwar, SHO of Tendukheda, told TOI over phone that there was no guard at the bank. "CCTV shows the lone robber spent almost an hour and half in the bank, trying to break into the chest," he said.
 
 The owner of the building was the first to see the "hole in the wall" and informed the bank manager, who called police. The cops said that there was a baraat procession in the village on Saturday and the thief took advantage of the noise to break into the bank. "We will nab the thief soon," said Ahirwar.
