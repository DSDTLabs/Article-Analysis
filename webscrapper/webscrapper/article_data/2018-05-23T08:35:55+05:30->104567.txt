MADURAI: The   district administration has formed medical teams to check people from Kerala entering the district for symptoms of nipah virus on Tuesday.

 
 In the wake of nipah virus claiming several lives in Kerala, the   government has taken precautionary steps to prevent the spreading of the virus into the state. While collectors of the districts sharing a border with Kerala have been alerted, Theni collector M Pallavi Baldev conducted a meeting on Tuesday. Higher officials from various departments and health authorities took part in the meeting.
 
 The medical teams are stationed at the   border at Kumily, Bodi Mettu and Cumbum Mettu roundthe-clock. Disinfectants are also being applied on vehicles entering the state.
 
 “Those found having fever are given medicines and their details are recorded. Those who have the symptoms would be isolated and separately treated,” said a medical officer posted at Kumily.
 
 The district administration has also asked people not to eat fruits eaten by bats as they may be infected with nipah virus.
 
 The health authorities in the district have been instructed to keep the required medicines and equipment ready to treat patients in case of an infection.
 
 Local body officials have been alerted to improve the sanitation in their respective areas.
