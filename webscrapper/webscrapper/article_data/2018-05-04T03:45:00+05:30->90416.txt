Nagpur: Former MLA Ashok Dhawad has written a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis demanding conversion of all   to freehold. The ex-MLA has pointed out that Fadnavis had raised this demand many times as an opposition MLA.

 Recently, the state government had decided to make all nazul plots owned by partition refugees freehold. The decision has benefited mostly the Sindhi community but left non-refugees fuming. Most non-refugees had got nazul plots on lease 30 to 40 years before the refugees.
 
 Dhawad reminded Fadnavis that he had promised Dhantoli Nagrik Mandal to make nazul plots freehold. There are 17 localities in the city that have nazul plots.
 
 Nazul plot holders have to seek permission of revenue department for selling or mortgaging their plots. A no objection certificate (NOC) is needed even for construction a house or redeveloping it. The revenue officials make plot holders run from pillar to post for the clearances. In most cases, the necessary documents are provided only after receipt of a bribe through touts.
 
 The ex-MLA has expressed hope that CM would fulfil his promise to citizens and take a cabinet decision to make all nazul plots in Vidarbha freehold. Most states have already done so and Maharashtra is one of those lagging behind.
