Coimbatore:   India has agreed to improve the infrastructure of the   hockey stadium at Corporation Boy’s Higher Secondary School, RS Puram, in the city, on par with international standards. 

 Secretary of the Coimbatore District Hockey Association and CEO, treasurer of Tamil Nadu Hockey Association P Senthil Rajkumar said he had met the officials at Hockey India and submitted a proposal to improve the infrastructure and basic amenities for the stadium in the city. The officials have agreed to release funds for the same. 
 
 “I will meet the corporation commissioner, K Vijayakarthikeyan, to make this stadium on par with international ones. The association has decided to earmark some funds and set up hostels and other accommodation facilities for the players. We have plans to organize a national event in Coimbatore,” said Rajkumar. He said that they plan to provide all the amenities and facilities to ensure that even world cup events for junior level players can be held here. 
 
 The Coimbatore Corporation in 2014 had passed a resolution to spend nearly Rs 74 lakh to lay the turf. Later, the city corporation also decided to set up a gallery and basic facilities and Rs 5 crore was earmarked for it. The project was much delayed and is yet to be completed. 
 
 The work has been stopped for the past one month and the school students and local boys have started damaging the levelled ground and the first layer of the turf by playing on it. Sources said that fencing work had to be carried out without which the turf would get damaged. “Only if the ground is fenced and compounds are set up, the turf will be damage-proof,” said a source in the corporation. 
 
 R Ramakrishnan, hockey coach said, “If the stadium is completed in a year’s time, students in the city have great potential to be part of the national team and represent India in 2020 and 2024 Olympics.”
