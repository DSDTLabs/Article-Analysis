AGRA: From Thursday, visitors to   will be able to see the iconic 17th century monument at sunrise. The Archaeological Survey of India ( ) has finally given its nod for the monument complex to be open half-an-hour before sunrise. 

 The gates on the east and west side of the monument will be open for visitors for dawn viewing. According to the notice issued by ASI, ticket booking counters, however, will be opened an hour before sunrise and will be shut 45 minutes before sunset. Both gates will be shut half-an-hour before sunset. There will be no change in the timings of the south gate, which opens at 8 am and closes at 5 pm.
 
 A decision in this regard was taken in a high-level meeting on January 2 in Delhi and has been implemented now. The meeting had been attended by ASI director-general Usha Sharma, inspector-general of police (Agra) Raja Srivastava,   (Agra) Brij Bhushan, ASI superintending archaeologist for Agra circle Bhuvan  , ASI ADG RS Lal, Agra Development Authority vice-chairman Anil Dhingra and deputy director (tourism) Dinesh Kumar.
 
 Bhuvan Vikram Singh, superintendent archaeologist in ASI for Agra circle, said the decision to advance the opening time to sunrise was taken in view of widespread demands of tourists. Another important decision taken at the January 2 meeting was that only 40,000 Indian tourists, including children under 15 years of age with 'zero charge' tickets, would be allowed to visit Taj Mahal daily and this number will be divided into forenoon and afternoon ticketing, like cinema hall tickets.
 
 The first slot will be from sunrise to 12 pm and second slot from 12 pm to sunset. However, high potential tickets (Rs 1000) will have no capping and slots, although ASI will introduce separate tickets of Rs 100 each for entering the main crypt.
