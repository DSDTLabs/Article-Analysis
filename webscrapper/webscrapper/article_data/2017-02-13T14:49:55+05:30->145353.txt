 has started shooting for Pradeep M Nair’s   this week and the team has now released the poster of the film, which is basically a colourful sketch a youngster sitting on the ground as a plane flies by. 

 The film’s director had earlier told us, “Vimaanam is an inspiring tale of a man achieving his dream despite all odds. Prithviraj plays a differently-abled youth who drops out of school after his pre-degree to build an   that he can fly.”
  
 However, the director is quick to clarify that though the main character is physically challenged, the film is not based on the real-life, speech and hearing impaired hero Saji Thomas, who built an ultra-light aircraft all by himself. Pradeep says, “This is a fictional story and only a few portions have been inspired from Saji’s life. Prithviraj will not be seen as a hearing-and-speech impaired protagonist, and Vimaanam is a musical love story. He is a desi mechanic of sorts. I don’t want to reveal more about his character right now.”
