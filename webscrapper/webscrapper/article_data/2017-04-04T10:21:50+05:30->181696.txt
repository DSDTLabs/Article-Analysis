NEW DELHI: Twelve former Indian Test have written to the  's   ( ) seeking compensation for being ‘indiscriminately' left out of the one-time benefit payment made by the Indian cricket board in 2013. All these cricketers played one to nine Tests between 1970 and 2003.

 Vivek Razdan,   (jr),  , Subroto Banerjee,  ,  , Suru Naik, Yograj Singh, Pranab Roy , Gulam Parkar, Rashid Patel and David Johnson have asked the CoA and board officials to consider their request for compensation, leaving it to board officials to decide the compensation amount.
 
 The letter from the former cricketers, while lauding BCCI's decision to disburse Rs 70 crore to 130 former Test cricketers during the 2013 IPL final, goes on to say, “While the criterion for making the above one-time payment was that the cricketers should have played Tests before 2003, the last category , i.e. those having played up to 9 Tests, was reserved for those cricketers who had played before 1970. In one stroke, cricketers who had played up to 9 Tests between 1970 and 2003 were kept out of the scheme, which even to the naked eye is discriminatory .
 
 “Some cricketers who had played ODIs were able to fulfill the criterion since according to another formula, 3 ODIs were deemed to equal one Test and some other were compensated in the first-class criterion category ,“ the letter read. “Yet, there are some cricketers who have got the rough end of the stick since they played between 1970 and 2003, and also did not play enough ODIs to help them qualify under 10 to 24 Test category .Luckily for women cricketers, this categorization has not been insisted upon.“
 
 The cricketers also met acting president CK Khanna recently and requested him to discuss the matter in boardroom meetings. Khanna told TOI: “We will take up this matter in the appropriate forum, which is the general body , and decide on it.“
