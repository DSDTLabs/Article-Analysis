BENGALURU:   will be disrupted intermittently in certain part of the city from 10am to 5pm from February 24 to 28. This include areas under the Adugodi, St John's Wood, Koramangala, K&C Valley, Cessna Business Park, Exora, HSR Layout, Shobha Apartment and   (RMZ) sub-stations, owing to work taken up to increase the height of the existing 220KV Hoodi-EPIP and Hoodi-HSR DC overhead line near   400KV Station. 

 The height is being increased to make room for the construction of a viaduct by BMRCL on its Byappanahalli-Whitefield corridor.
