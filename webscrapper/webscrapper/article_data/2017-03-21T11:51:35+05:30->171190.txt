NAGPUR: Newly-elected mayor   had a baptism by fire during her first general body meeting held on Monday.

 She was gheraoed by   and   leaders and harangued with ‘mayor muradabad’ cries over water tanker issue. But Jichkar remained unruffled and moved on with proceedings.   stalwarts, senior corporator Dayashankar Tiwari, ruling party leader Sandip Joshi and former mayor Pravin Datke, all sitting together in front row, kept prodding her when needed.
 
 When the Congress and BSP leaders refused to go back to their seats, Tiwari and Joshi signalled Jichkar to get up from the mayor’s chair and end the proceedings. Sources said prior to the meeting, Joshi and other leaders were inside the mayor’s chamber, briefing her on how proceedings are to be conducted.
 
 When senior leaders like Purushottam Hazare refused to sit, Jichkar maintained her calm, patiently reminding him to let others speak. She allowed everybody to speak, gave corporators a fair time to express their views. Unlike previous meetings, this was seemed a relatively well-behaved, probably because it was chaired by a woman.
 
 Jichkar’s first experience of the house was “exciting and enriching.” She said, “I wasn’t nervous, I knew about the proceedings. While putting forth their issues, there will be times when leaders will get aggressive. I am prepared for it, my job will be to handle it patiently.”
 
 Having a female mayor is a motivation for female corporators. “She is like a driving force. Seeing her sitting on mayor’s chair, we realize politics has the same place for women,” said corporator Bharti Bunde.
