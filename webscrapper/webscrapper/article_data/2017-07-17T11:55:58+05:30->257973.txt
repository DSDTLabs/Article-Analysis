COIMBATORE: The city police have installed manual control systems in 20   to control them from inside the traffic   by police personnel to minimise vehicles’ waiting time at traffic signals.

 According to the city police, until now all the traffic signals have been functioning automatically and based on the vehicle movements timings were fixed on the timers at the traffic signals to change  . 
 
 Police said sometimes, at traffic junctions, the signal will remain green when there are no vehicles to pass through it. So the vehicles on the other side are forced to wait at the traffic signal. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M Durai said, “We have set the timing for some signal lights to change colour in 120 seconds. But motorists used to cross the signal within 20 seconds. So the motorists on the other sides are forced to wait at least 100 seconds. 
 
 But now, the traffic police personnel can change the signal lights from the signal umbrella. It would help the motorist to reduce spending more time at the traffic signals.” 
 
 The traffic police have installed the manual control systems at Avinashi Road, Athupalam, Ukkadam, Lalacorner, ARC Junction on Mettupalayam road, Chinthamani, Lakshmi Mills, Nava India, Suguna Kalyanamandapam, RK Mill, Fun Mall, VK Road, Coimbatore Medical College and at SITRA traffic signal umbrellas. 
 
 “We would install more manual control systems based on the success of present installations,” said a senior police officer.
