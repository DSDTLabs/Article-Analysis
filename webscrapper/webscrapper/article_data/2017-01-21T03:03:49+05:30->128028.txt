NAINITAL: Over 16,000 people living in 24 villages of Nainital district have in unison decided to boycott the Uttarakhand polls. The villagers feel that the polls are the right time to highlight their woes, as it is during this period that politicians "wake up" from the "slumber" and come asking for votes. 

  These villages are still deprived of basic amenities such as ration card, health and education centres besides many others. The authorities say that the facilities could not reach these villages as they are 'van gram' and not 'revenue village'.
