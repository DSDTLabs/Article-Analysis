HYDERABAD: For residents of Boduppal, sleepless nights are a daily affair. As are whistles and taps on gates by watchmen in the middle of the night, rousing them from their troubled sleep. They must heed this call, or else suffer without water for an entire week.

 Housing about 50,000 people, Boduppal gets water only once a week for around 90 minutes or so. The supply timing is also erratic, forcing residents to attune their lives to its mercy. “Yesterday, we got water at 11 pm. A week before, it was released at 2 am. Unfortunately, we couldn’t hear the whistle both times and were roused by a cousin who lives in the neighbourhood. By the time we woke up, it was already late and we couldn’t store enough water,” said S   of  .
 
 Residents fear that once summer intensifies, their problems will too and they will be forced to shell out a lot of money on tankers. “As of now, we are getting water once a week. But I am quite sure that as summer progresses, the frequency will decrease and water will be released once in 15 days,” said A Suvarchala, a resident of Srinivasa Nagar Colony. 
 
 Suvarchala’s daughter Nidhi, a B Tech third year student, rued how she is forced to spend her summer holidays at home in anticipation of water.
 
 “Here, water can be released at any time on any day. So, someone has to stay at home and make sure that the water is stored. Else we will have to suffer for the next week,” said Alekhya, who too was irked at not being able to visit her relatives and friends last summer. She worries that the situation will be the same, if not worse, this year.
 
 Boduppal is home to many industries, function halls and is emerging as a major residential locality owing to its proximity to Secunderabad and the  . However, with the acute water problem, its future seems bleak.
