 KOZHIKODE: Experts working in the field of   fear that the new law, which has  , might have an undesired impact by leading to non-reporting of many cases, especially those involving close relatives.
 
 The main apprehension many of them put forward is that such a legislation can indirectly bring down the number of reported rape cases where the culprit is a close relative or guardians of children.
 
 Child rights activists say that families are likely to withhold reporting such cases fearing that it can permanently damage relations and lead to never-ending complications in the family. The limited chance to revoke such a penalty in case of an error is another factor.
 
 Nazeer Chaliyam, former chairperson of the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said the conviction rate in   cases was low owing to the delay in completing the investigation and hearing. “The number of convictions is likely to come down with the new amendment. Also, the number of cases in which the accused try to influence the victim’s family or threaten the victim to settle the case is likely to go up with the new ordinance,” he said.
 
 Nazeer said that such legislation should be introduced after a detailed sociological study. “Expediting legal procedures within the existing law and ensuring conviction of all accused should be given priority instead,” he said. Child right activists and social workers felt that the chance of out-of-court settlement would be higher since the new decision has death penalty.
 
 M P Muhammadali, coordinator of  , said that even death penalty would have the desired impact only if the case was disposed in the prescribed timeframe.
