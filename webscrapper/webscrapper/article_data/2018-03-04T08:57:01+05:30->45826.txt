HYDERABAD: While it took three days for actress  's body to be brought from Dubai to India after her 'accidental drowning' but a labourer's family in   had to wait for 66 days for his body. 

  Srinivas Rathod, a 35-year-old man, from   village of Nizamabad district, died on December 28, last year. One of his daughter had to appear for her intermediate first year examination on Saturday while her father's body arrived. 
 
 "The procedures took a long time. When there was inordinate delay, our volunteers helped out by coordinating with various agencies involved to bring Srinivas's body home," said Patkuri Basanth Reddy, president of  . Basanth Reddy also attended the last rites of the deceased at his native village.
 
 Srinivas went to work as a labourer in a construction company in Dubai to clear his debts nine months ago. According  , a relative of Srinivas, the 35-year-old reportedly died after a pipe at the construction site fell on him. "There was nobody to help us get the body back to India. The family suffered great trauma waiting for the body," he said.
 
 Srinivas is survived by his wife Saroja, two daughters Mounika, Neeraja and son Nithin. Vasanth Rao said representations had been made to many politicians and Basanth Reddy responded to their plea for help. "No family should suffer like this waiting for the body of a beloved one," he said.
 
 Srinivas was in debt as he had sunk four borewells, none of which yielded water. He also took a loan to move to Dubai. The family found out about his death on the same day as the accident. The Telangana government wrote to the Union ministry of external affairs and CGI, Dubai for help in expatriating the body to India.
