KOLKATA: “It could easily have been us,“ feel terrified neighbours of the Shaws, whose home on   collapsed on Tuesday, killing two people.

  (54), his wife and son live with three other families in a building declared hazardous by KMC over three years ago. One does not even need to look at the warning sign, “Bipajjanak bari (Dangerous building)“, hung on the façade of his home just across the street on 10 Indian Mirror Street, to know it's unsafe. 
 
 The plaster has disappeared, the stairs are creaking and a layer of fungus has settled on every exposed part. “I had a sleepless night. The only thought in my mind was, what if our house also meets the same fate? Even this building is very old and in urgent need of repair,“said Guha. Tuesday's incident has shaken the occupants of 9 Indian Mirror Street, which sprawls over 22 cottahs. It has four tenants on three commercial establishments on the ground floor. 
 
 Though a real estate developer purchased the land six years ago with the objective of razing the current structure and building a highrise, the plan has not materialised. “Currently, only four families occupy the building. Close to six other tenants were shifted by promoters two years ago because he wanted to develop the property. But then the plan got shelved and we have been staying in this condemned building. We are scared after Tuesday's incident,“ said  , whose family has been staying in the building for over 80 years. On Wednesday, the families took refuge in other houses in the neighbourhood.
 
 “It's unfortunate that people are getting killed by building collapse. We will hold a meeting on how to bail out the residents of endangered houses,“ mayor   said on Wednesday.
