PATNA: The state disaster management department (DMD) is all set to upgrade its existing emergency operation centre (EOC) by equipping it with an advanced early warning system by September this year. The move is aimed at mitigating disaster risk in the state.

 “The early warning system is a software-based device which will work round the clock. It will be installed in the rooms at the new Police Bhawan,” DMD additional secretary Anirudh Kumar said on Wednesday.
 
 “The central system will be linked with the computerised system installed at the district and block levels,” Prasad said, adding the three-tier system will constitute the platform from where early warnings will be sent to the authorities of all districts as well the people. “The early warnings will help people and authorities concerned to take precautionary steps. The installation of the new system is part of the road map of global Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agreement to which India is a signatory. Our aim is to reduce deaths and ensure safety of people,” Kumar said. 
 
 The DMD has already floated a global tender to shortlist the consultancy firms for the final allotment of the work order for the installation of early warning system.
 
 On Wednesday, DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit led a team of representatives from these firms to the Police Bhawan to have a look at the rooms and the space allotted to the DMD for the installation of the new EOC. The old EOC works from a separate building on the campus of the Old Secretariat. It is manned by the staff from DMD and state disaster response force.
 
 A team of state government officials, including principal secretaries of health, agriculture and DMD, had returned from the six-day study tour of Philippines last week. “The team had studied the functioning of the early warning system besides learning capacity building methods and community awareness mechanism in Philippines,” Kumar added.
