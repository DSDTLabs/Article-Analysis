Does the crown of being the most beautiful, desirable woman of   also come with its share of thorns? If  , whose star is on the rise with believable performances in films like Chaamp, Cockpit and Kabir, has one chink in her armour, it’s the arm candy she keeps — her boyfriend and only hero till date, Dev. Only last week, the industry was aflutter with the news of a major casting change in Dev’s next venture, Hoichoi Unlimited, a plane hijack comedy slated for a puja release. Without even a preamble,   — the chosen heroine for the film — was shunted out and the role was offered to others. Among them was Tonushree Chakraborty. Once the latter backed out, it went to  . The story goes that Rukmini was uncomfortable with the proximity that   was sharing with Mimi, as she had been uncomfortable earlier with Dev’s closeness to her former partner, Subhashree during the shooting of Dhumketu. I clearly remember how Rukmini parked herself at the outdoor shoot of Kaushik Ganguly’s film, both eyes anxiously fixed on her boyfriend’s movements. Some bitchy souls say that she is the only reason why the film is yet to see the light of day. When the duo attended the premiere of Subhashree’s Honeymoon, Rukmini didn’t exchange a word with the film’s leading lady and left in the first 30 minutes. Cut to the present, the same narrative is repeating itself in Hoichoi Unlimited. Even though Rukmini stuck to her public declaration of not starring opposite BF Dev, she sure is happy that no one she was uncomfortable with was signed on. I wonder what irks Rukmini — the fact that   is single at the moment? Or is it Dev’s reputation as a ladies’ man? Or is it an outpouring of her frustration at being a beautiful lady, who still can’t control her guy? The jury is still out on that one.
