COLVA: Although the   ( ) had in 2012 resolved to use the town’s iconic municipal garden solely for recreational purposes, it now appears to have converted part of the space into a dumpyard for a variety of items. 

 On the garden’s eastern side, a large space holds confiscated material such as handcarts, hoardings, and metal steps and flooring that were erected on areas demarcated as setbacks. Vehicles belonging to the civic body are also parked within the garden. 
 
 “Despite having such a large, verdant garden within which busts of eminent personalities have also been installed, it is sad that the council has turned part of it into an eyesore by stacking a host of unwanted items,”  , a resident of Margao, said.
 
 Chairperson   said although she has long wanted to give the garden a facelift through an MPLAD scheme or other avenues, plans have been kept on the backburner as several more pressing issues have cropped up from time to time. 
 
 “I have already asked the chief officer to speak with people involved in such tasks,” she said.
