RAJKOT: Amid floods, the   police officials performed the duty of armed forces engaged in rescue operation when they got an SOS call from one of the 25 students in a bus that had been stranded on   national highway at   near Limbdi on Saturday morning.

 “The students said they were engineering students headed for Ahmedabad to appear for an examination and if they did not reach on time they would miss the exam. I sent a team of police officials to the spot where the bus was stranded in the water. The entire 1km stretch of the highway was closed as it had been waterlogged. Seeing the gravity of the situation, we immediately swung into action. I arranged a truck for the students which took them to Ahmedabad driving through the water,” said Surendranagar superintendent of police Deepak Meghani.
 
 Meghani said he received thanks messages from the students who reached Ahmedabad in time with help of police. “I also saw to it that policemen accompanied students in the truck to Ahmedabad to ensure their safe journey. I feel overwhelmed by message of thanks I got from them.” 
 
 One of the students, Sanjay Kacha, said, “The entire incident has made us change our perception of the cops. Now, we look up to policemen as our true saviours.”
