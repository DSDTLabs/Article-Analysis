CHANDIGARH: Even as the temporary vending sites are being constructed, the shifting of Sector 17-based vendors has turned out to be a major headache for the authority. Sources confirmed that although the architecture department of the   has identified the sites for Sector 17 vendors in Sector 15, the vendors have already opposed the move.

 Since the architecture department has already asked the municipal corporation (MC) for no vending zone in sectors 17, 22 and 19 and sectors 1 to 6, municipal councillors have been opposing the move saying that it is not feasible to kick out people from such areas. Municipal councillors had even asked that if there will not be any   around the tourist places like  , they will lose their charm.
 
 The municipal councillors had even held a number of the meetings with the architecture department to settle the issue, but highlighting the heritage status of such areas, the department has rejected to include these sectors in the vendors zone. The architecture department has, however, assured to look into the matter of Sector 22 vendors.
 
 The temporary sites for the vendorsâ€™ zones have been decided by the architecture department by spreading them in the entire city. In some of the areas, area municipal councilolrs also accompanied the team of the architect department.
 
 The engineering department of the MC has already kicked off the construction of the temporary site for the vendors. The estimated cost of construction of such temporary vending zones is around Rs 90 lakhs.
