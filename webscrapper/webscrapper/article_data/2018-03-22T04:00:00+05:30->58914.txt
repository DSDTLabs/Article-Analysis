Mumbai: Cash-strapped   has exited its   joint venture with American insurer  . Of its 51.3% stake in  , the company has sold 25.3% to Vallabh Bhansali’s   and 26% to the   firm  .

 After the divestment, Videocon ceases to be the Indian promoter of the non-life company, which is being renamed as Liberty General Insurance. The stake sale has already received approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( ).
 
 The Boston-headquartered Liberty Mutual Insurance Group now becomes the largest shareholder in the venture with a 49% stake. The US insurer said that it was committed to the Indian market as well as India’s growth story. Both Enam and Jindal, being strategic investors, will have their investment locked in for five years, according to regulatory guidelines.
 
 Liberty General Insurance has a paid-up capital of Rs 1,084 crore. The company has registered 38% growth in the last quarter without any exposure to crop insurance, making it one of the fastest growing general insurance companies (excluding crop insurance) in India. 
 
 “The best part about the reorganisation is that the two new business promoters that have come in have committed to the existing business plan of the company, which entails fairly aggressive growth. All the promoters have promised to infuse capital according to growth requirements,” said Roopam Asthana, CEO & whole time director of the Liberty Mutual joint venture company in India. The five-year old company is looking at a break-even in FY20.
 
 “Currently, we do 70% motor and 30% non-motor business. The intent is to grow non-motor, largely health, at a faster rate and increase its share to 35%” said Asthana. “We are not only the fastest growing but have one of the best portfolios. Our claims ratio at 67% is second-best in the industry and marginally behind the number one.”
