GHAZIABAD: A 16-year-old girl was found hanging from the   of stairs in her rented accommodation in   on Monday evening. The parents of the girl on Tuesday met district magistrate   and submitted a complaint alleging that their daughter was first raped and then hanged from the stairs to make it look like a suicide. 

 A directive was passed to the SSP to conduct an inquiry into the matter. The parents lodged a complaint with the office of SSP. 
 
 The mother of the class X girl, who works as a librarian in a private school, said she last saw her daughter on Monday around 6.30 am before leaving for work. When she returned around 2 pm she found the girl hanging from the railing with injury marks on her abdomen and legs.
 
 “I leave for office around 6.30 am. My daughter used to leave at 7.20 am for her school. On Monday I left home as usual after serving her breakfast. My daughter never reached her school. Someone attacked her while she was alone and after raping and murdering her, hanged her body using a dupatta to make it look like a suicide,” the girl’s mother told TOI. 
 
 She refuted police’s claim that her daughter committed suicide owing to academic pressure.
 
 CO (Sahibabad)   said the parents had not mentioned rape when he visited the spot on Monday evening. He also said the postmortem report stated the death was due to hanging and did not mention sexual assualt. 
 
 “No complaint was given to us till Monday by the girl’s parents. I specifically asked them if they suspected any foul play in the matter, but their response was in the negative.”
