 There is nothing other than a party on a Saturday night that keeps P3Ps excited. And that was exactly what these peeps enjoyed during the weekend. By the poolside at a star hotel, where Sneha Nair threw a party for her friends, these ladies had a helluva time. The music and ambience were just perfect for them to live it up. Among others, spotted at the do was actress Namitha. In a blue party dress, she was dressed for the occasion. In a black dress, Reshma, too, looked charming and posed for the shutterbugs with a captivating smile.
