NAGPUR: The union budget has come in for mixed reactions from academicians vis-a-vis the announcements made regarding education sector. 

  Nago Ganar said, “Providing autonomy to institutions can be harmful for the education system. Institutes will become private and government will not be able to control them. Privatization of institutes will lead to commercialization.”
 
 Jaspal Singh, principal of  , said, “I welcome the central government’s move of freeing up CBSE from conducting entrance exams as it will increase focus of students on academics and research. Providing skill development is another area where we can improve as many students prefer to study abroad because of the skill development they receive.”
 
 Mahesh Yenkie, former pro-vice chancellor of   said, “Provision of autonomy to the institutes is excellent but funds are more necessary than that. The Swayam platform will definitely help students, as usage of internet is on the rise and these courses will be of great help to gain knowledge.”
 
 Haribhau Kedar, former VC of NU said, “Overall, the budget of this year is good but the implementation of reforms is the challenge. The 350 online courses that are going to start will help only a section of society who have access to internet. Sankalp is also good programme but implementation will see to its success.”
 
 Sanjay Tayde-Patil, founder-president of Maharashtra English Schools Trustee Association said, “This year’s budget is a disappointment for Maharashtra as it has got no new funds or institutions. BJP has been emphasizing on skill education from last two years when in fact it should have focused on strengthening primary education in country.”
 
 Senior academician Eknath Kathale said, “Bringing changes in the UGC is not a good reform. I believe that government is trying to get away with the obligation of paying grants to the universities. Granting college’s autonomy will remove government from the obligation. In this year’s budget, emphasis was on only science field but the other fields are neglected. Rather than bringing reforms, government should have tried to improve the drawbacks in the system.”
