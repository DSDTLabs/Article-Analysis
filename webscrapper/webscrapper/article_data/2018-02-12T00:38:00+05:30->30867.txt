Tirupur: Relatives and colleagues of a 25-year-old government nurse, who committed suicide at the staff quarters in Vellakoil here on Saturday, staged a protest in front of the Kangeyam Government Hospital on Sunday, demanding action against two doctors who ‘tortured’ her.

 The victim, R Manimala of Narimedu in Panruti of Cuddalore district, was working as a nurse at the Vellakoil Primary Health Centre (PHC) here for the last two years, police sources said. “The unmarried woman was staying in the government quarters with another nurse. She was found hanging in the room on Saturday evening. Though she was rushed to the Kangeyam Government Hospital, doctors declared her as brought dead,” a police officer said.
 
 Claiming that two doctors at the PHC tortured her and forced her to commit suicide, about 20 government nurses and paramedical staff, along with Manimala’s relatives, staged a protest in front of the Kangeyam GH on Sunday morning.
 
 The relatives lodged a police complaint against two doctors, who allegedly put unnecessary pressure on Manimala. Recently, one of the doctors had reportedly handed over a memo to her.
 
 “We have registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) and are investigating the role of the doctors in the suicide” the officer added.
