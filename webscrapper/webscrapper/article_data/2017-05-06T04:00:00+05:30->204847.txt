Surat: There are around 150-odd city buses operating on 21 routes which cover 259km in Surat. The civic body plans to introduce 75 new buses on four more routes. The city buses have total ridership of 35,000 passengers per day. This ridership figure is pathetic but was achieved in just three months. SMC plans to run 500 city buses by 2017-18 as it wants to cover 90% of the city area. 

 Shivanand Swamy from Cept University, Ahmedabad said, “Actually, we need 600 passengers per day per bus to break even with single ticket for both segments of BRTS and city buses. At present, our city bus ridership per day per bus is about 250. Single ticket system is expected to come into effect by July and it will be of great help.”tnn
