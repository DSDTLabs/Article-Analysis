CHANDIGARH: A district court here extended the police custody of a temporary warder of Burail jail who was arrested on Sunday for allegedly trying to smuggle in   into the prison. 

  was arrested after a suspicious warder checked him and found him in possession of 0.8g heroin and 6.6g charas on Sunday night. Police informed the court on Tuesday that they also wanted to produce the accused before   alias Rocky, a jail inmate who had filed a PIL in high court, alleging that drugs were being supplied to inmates inside the jail. 
 
 A temporary staffer, 25-year-old Kaushal had been staying in the jail complex for three years. He was produced before the court of judicial magistrate first class(JMIC)   and he remanded in one-day police custody. 
 
 Seeking his custody, police said they wanted to take Kaushal to   for making him meet Rocky. The police also claimed that Kaushal had revealed in his disclosure statement that he would buy the drugs from a woman named Geeta. Police said his mobile records also showed he was in touch with the woman and they needed to speak to her as well. 
 
 The defence counsel opposed the remand, claiming that the police wouldnâ€™t even take the accused to Sangrur and had failed to recover anything from him in the past 24 hours. He said if they continued to go by disclosure statement, police would get him to name another location next time. Taking note of the same, the magistrate directed the cops to ensure his DDR entry was made in Sangrur. The accused was booked under sections 20, 21 and 22 of the NDPS Act, after 0.9g heroin, 6.6g charas, and 350 habit-forming tablets were seized from him.
