CHENNAI: DMK legislators will not receive the revised salary of 1.05 lakh per month till the   government settles the pay revision for transport department employees, party working president   said on Monday. 

 "I explained to the government that 89 DMK MLAs, including DMK president  , are not ready to accept the revised salary. We tried to bring the suicides of farmers and the transport department employees' demand for salary revision to the notice of the government. Despite my explanation, the government did not listen and hiked the salary," Stalin told party cadre at a May Day function here.
 
 Stalin said when the salary revision had been announced in the assembly, he had told the government that there were several pending issues and people were suffering. He wanted the government to postpone the revision, but it did not accept his suggestion.
 
 Stalin said it was former chief minister   who had announced leave for workers on May Day and it was DMK president M Karunanidhi who announced that May Day would be a paid holiday. Karunanidhi had also taken steps to make former Prime Minister V P Singh declare May Day as a holiday countrywide, he added.
 
 Stalin addressed the cadre at the May Day Park in Chintadripet.
