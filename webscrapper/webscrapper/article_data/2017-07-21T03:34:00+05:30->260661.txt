Porvorim: Revenue minister Rohan Khaunte assured the House on Thursday that action will be initiated against illegalities in Colvale Comunidade plot allotments after the issue was raised by Tivim MLA Nilkant Halarnkar (Congress) during the Question Hour. Halarnkar alleged massive illegalities in plot allotment, while the revenue minister said no complaint was received by his office. “The plots were sold at Rs 50 per sqm whereas the actual cost of land is over Rs 10,000 per sqm. As much as 13 bungalows have already been built,” said Halarnkar. The revenue minister said though there is no complaint, his department will initiate an investigation and also offered to conduct a site inspection.
