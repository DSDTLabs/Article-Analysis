HYDERABAD: It was an early morning shock for residents of 440 flats in Rainbow Vistas Phase I in   (near IDL) area on Monday when they received water reeking of foul smell. Following a complaint, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) looked into the problem and rectified it. 

 
  
 
 "We have never experienced this phenomenon before. The smell was unbearable. There is a big sump on the apartment's premises. When the residents opened the taps, they were taken aback by the putrefied smell of the water," treasurer of Rainbow Vistas Ram   told TOI. 
 
 Even after some time, the residents received contaminated water reeking of bad smell. "As a result, all the flat owners purchased bottled water," he said.
 
 When contacted, water board general manager, operations and maintenance division (KPHB municipality), RB  , said: "We received a number of complaints from   and   areas on supply of contaminated water. We restored the normal water supply by Monday night." Regarding complaint of Rainbow Vistas residents about getting smelly water, a senior board official said they were aware of the problem and rectified it on a priority.
 
 "We had resorted to a 24-hour shutdown to attend to junction works on a key water pipeline between Lingampally and Hi-tec City. Some areas got delayed water and some had no water in   area because of the works," he said. Works were completed on April 22 night and several areas got water supply restored. However, residents of Moosapet and   continued to face water supply issues due to a 48-hour shutdown to take up junction works.
