Erode: At least five sheep were mauled to death by an unidentified carnivorous at Sanyasipatty village near Bhavani here on Tuesday. 

 Forest officials have launched a search for the carnivorous and they suspect that the sheep were killed by a wild dog. “The sheep were killed on Tuesday evening,” said T Chinnappan, who reared them. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Chinnappan took the sheep, 12 of them, for grazing and after that tied them in an enclosed pen. After a while, he heard some noise from the pen. “When I came out, an animal that looked like a wild dog suddenly jumped out from the pen and disappeared in the nearby forest,” Chinnappan said.
 
 When alerted, a group of forest officials rushed to the village and they confirmed the pug marks looked similar to that of a wild dog. “We have collected pug mark samples and sent it for verification,” they said. The officials said they would set a trap for the animal.
