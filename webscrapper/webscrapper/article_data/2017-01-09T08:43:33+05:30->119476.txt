LUCKNOW: Amid the raging feud within the  , Congress leaders seem to be rooting for Akhilesh Yadav.

 After Delhi former CM   and   CM   pitched for Akhilesh, veteran Congressman Narain Dutt Tiwari sent a letter to SP patriarch   asking him to hand over the reins of the party to Akhilesh, who he has described as a young and established leader.
 
 “I am very sad over the dispute, which has been continuing for quite some time now,“ read the letter by three-time UP CM Tiwari. “By grooming Akhilesh and introducing him to politics at the right time, you have given the country an experienced young leader who has become a youth icon praised by top politicians cutting across party lines,“ the letter read.
 
 Expressing hope that Mulayam will take his request seriously, Tiwari said he has always treated Mulayam as his younger brother and Akhilesh as a nephew.
 
 “I hope you will support Akhilesh and remove hurdles that have come his way and bless him to ensure his success in his political future,“ the letter read.
