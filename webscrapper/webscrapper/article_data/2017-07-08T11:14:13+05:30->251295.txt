VADODARA: The opposition   in the   primary education committee has demanded that the state government should employ full-time physical education teachers in primary as well as secondary schools.

 Former member of the committee and veteran Congress worker I D   stated in a letter to the state education minister that posts of physical education teachers were lying vacant at one end and, on the other, the state government was holding events like Khel Mahakumbh.
