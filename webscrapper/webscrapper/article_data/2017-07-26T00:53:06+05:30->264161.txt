NAVI MUMBAI: Citizens and   are goading the   to undertake a detailed study to find out why so many   this year during the  .

  Compared to last year, the number of   in the city has increased by almost 19%, say local environmentalists. 
 
 The disaster management cell,  , has already recorded 226 trees falls on Tuesday across the eight wards since the onset of monsoons. Last year, between June and September, only 189 trees had fallen.
 
 Improper planning and excessive tree plantation drives instead of focusing on conservation are the probable cause of their early demise, said tree experts. 
 
 “Even the bare minimum space required for trees to be able to extend its roots is absent due to rampant concretization. Often, the trees may hit rocky ground merely two feet below the ground. Also, the haste for planting more tree with little thought on conservation is also another reason,” said Elsie Gabriel founder of Mumbai based Young Environmentalist Group. 
 
 According to the figures in the yet to be published tree census report 2016, over 37,000 trees have been stated to be imbalanced. “Trees which are found tilting 45 degrees have been termed imbalanced. The civic administration must either prune or provide them adequate support so that they don't fall,” said an official involved in the survey.
 
 Many are questioning the types of tree that are being planted. “What is the point of planting gulmohar or subabul trees? Their roots don't go deep and they are unable to withstand even minor climatic changes. Instead native variants such as Nilgiri, banyan or peepal should be given preference,” said social activist Arati Chauhan.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner (Garden), Tushar Pawar said necessary changes will be made in the plantation process. “We are finding means to preserve city's green cover. With regard to the survey findings, we are still verifying it,” he said.
