Hyderabad: In a first of its kind, US-based software giant   on Thursday entered into a MoU with Hyderabad-based National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR) to set up a design lab at the latter’s campus at Rajendranagar. The MoU was inked at the ‘Rural Innovation and Startup Conclave-2017’ that kicked off in Hyderabad on Thursday. 

 This is the first time that Autodesk has partnered with an Indian institute to cater to entrepreneurs working in the area of environment as well as the social sector, Autodesk global director (entrepreneur impact) Joachim Jake Layes said.
 
 NIRD&PR director general W R Reddy pointed out that the design lab is expected to be set up in the next few weeks and will provide rural entrepreneurs with Autodesk concepts and tools to build sustainable designs.
 
 Layes pointed out that globally Autodesk has touched over 3,000 entrepreneurs working in the areas of clean technology, renewable energy, agriculture, health and food, among others. Autodesk supports the entrepreneurs by providing software tools for free for three years after which it examines the possibility of extending its support on a case-to-case basis.
 
 “Of the 3,000, only around 20 are from India. We want to engage with more startups in India and are looking at more partnerships,” Layes explained.
 
 Inaugurating the conference, Union minister of state for the ministry of science and technology and earth sciences, Y S Chowdary, pointed out that in order to support entrepreneurship in rural areas, especially in the agricultural sector, institutes like NIRD&PR must work towards improving financial literacy. The government, instead of doling out more subsidies, must focus on supporting them to create sustainable solutions, he said.
