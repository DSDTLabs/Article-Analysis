NEW DELHI: New Zealand cricketer   on Sunday displayed amazing anticipation skills to take one of the best, if not the greatest, catches while fielding at the critical short-leg position. 

 On Day 2 of the third and final Test against hosts New Zealand in Hamilton, South Africa were steady at 190/5 with the pair of captain   and   shepherding the innings. In his search for a wicket, the home team skipper Kane Williamson decided to bring in   for the first time in the match in the 62nd over.
 
 And it turned out to be an inspired move as off his third delivery, Santner had Du Plessis caught by Latham for 53, giving his team the breakthrough they were looking for. However, the wicket was more of the fielder's doing than the left-arm spinner considering the intelligence and judgment displayed by Latham at short-leg.
 
 Du Plessis went for a paddle sweep off Santner and made a good contact as the ball flew to the right of Latham. However, even before the South African batsman had completed playing his shot, the fielder began moving in the direction of the ball and stuck out his right hand just in the nick of time to complete a stunning one-handed catch. 
 
 Naturally, everyone including Du Plessis was left shocked by the effort that ended his 42-run stand with De Kock for the sixth wicket. With the dismissal of their skipper, the tourists were left at 190/6 but a solid rearguard effort saw them posting 314 before being bowled out in 89.2 overs.
