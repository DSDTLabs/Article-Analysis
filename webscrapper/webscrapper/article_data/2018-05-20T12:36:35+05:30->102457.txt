KOCHI:   chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who was in the news for a string of random remarks that left his party colleagues red-faced and his rivals in splits, will come to Kerala for spearheading BJP campaign in Chengannur.

 
 The man who played a crucial role in ending the two-decade old dominance of the CPM in Tripura will reach Kochi on May 23 and hold talks with BJP leaders here to work out a strategy for the campaign.
 
 He will also take part in a roadshow with BJP candidate P S  , party sources said. “Deb’s programme in Chengannur will begin on May 24,” said N K Mohandas,   district president, BJP. “His programme is yet to be finalized. It will be done based on the message we get from the central leadership,” he said.
 
 Party leaders and workers believe Deb’s visit would be a morale booster for the BJP camp. “His visit will infuse more enthusiasm among party workers. We are eagerly waiting for him to reach here. Deb would be launching “carpet bombing” campaign and the other two fronts would be at the receiving end,” a party leader from Ernakulam said. .
