PATNA: A day after Patna SSP   removed all the police personnel of Jakkanpur police station and attached them with the Police Lines for their alleged connivance with bootleggers, zonal IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan on Tuesday transferred them out of Patna district.

 These police personnel include five SIs, six ASIs and 24 constables.
 
 The axe fell on them after five people were nabbed consuming liquor from the operation theatre of Sai Emergency Hospital near the Jakkanpur police station on Sunday night. Within hours after the raid conducted by a team sent from the police HQ, Jakkanpur SHO Inspector Amarendra Kumar Jha was suspended by the SSP.
 
 “Inspector Jha will not be given any field posting for the next ten years. City SP (east) Dhurat Saayli Salvaram will submit her probe report within two days, which will help us know if the policemen were acting in connivance with liquor smugglers,” the IG said, adding departmental proceedings would be initiated against all the 36 police personnel on the basis of the SP’s report.
 
 “I have directed the SSP to relieve the transferred police personnel within 24 hours so that they could report to the new places of their posting,” Khan said.
 
 Earlier, all the police personnel of Gopalganj’s Town police station were attached to the Police Lines on August 18 last year after a hooch tragedy. On February 3 this year, all the 30 police personnel, including SHO Dhirendra Pandey, of patna’s Beur police station were attached to the Police Lines for their alleged connivance with liquor smugglers. However, they were not transferred out of the districts.
