Chennai: Actor Vishal on Thursday lodged a complaint with the police commissioner’s office against unknown people who have been allegedly abusing him over the phone since Wednesday. The calls came after a website published an article in which Vishal is falsely quoted and speaks ill of Tamils.

 The complaint, lodged on behalf of the actor by V Harikrishnan, a representative of his fan’s association, said the report on website was false and that the actor received the calls after the article appeared. The article falsely quoted Vishal and said Tamils were lazy and that people in the state preferred to line up before Tasmac shops, said the complaint.
 
 Vishal’s complaint said the actor received several calls from three different numbers where the unidentified callers quoted the article.
 
 The complaint added that Vishal held Tamils in high regard and that the article has been published to deliberately malign his image. The actor also sought action against those spreading rumours.
