MADURAI: Thirty two   from Kanyakumari district in   and Kerala are feared to be detained at British   (BIOT) of Diego Garcia. According to sources, two deep sea fishing vessels Al-Ameen and Mermaid with their crew members are held at Diego Garcia since March 1.

 While Al-Ameen had 15 crew members on board, Mermaid had 17 crew members. The fishing boats left Kochi on February 5th and were supposed to return after a month long expedition. “We have learnt that the two fishing vessels are held at Diego Garcia, 1500 nautical miles away from India. We have informed the local fisheries officials and plan to petition the district administration on Monday,” said Jose Bilbin, president of Thoothoor deep sea fishermen cooperative society.
 
 The community received information after apparently the fishermen called and informed their families about the situation.
 
 However, fisheries officials said that they are yet to receive official confirmation. “Fishermen have informed us that two fishing vessels have been detained by British navy at British   Territory of Diego Garcia. We are waiting for the official confirmation from the central government,” said deputy director of fisheries, Lamek Jayakumar.
