KOLKATA: There will be a Passport   (PSK) every 50km in Kolkata — indeed throughout the country — and acquiring a   will be as easy as getting a driving licence or Aadhaar card, said  , secretary (CPV & OIA) of ministry of external affairs in Kolkata on Monday.

 He added that the passport will be the primary identification document for every Indian. Bengal, so far, has two PSKs and two PoPSK (post office doubling up as PSK). The existing infrastructure hardly matches the aspiration of MEA. “We are currently mapping Bengal to find out places to set up PSKs with an aim of having an equitable distribution,” he added. Two more PoPSK will be inaugurated on July 15 — one at Beadon Street Head Post office and another at   — by M J Akbar, minister of state for MEA.
 
 “We want every citizen to have a passport and use it as a tool towards opportunity and excellence. Our children are talented, they have aspirations. The Indian diaspora is ever expanding and we want to facilitate the dream of every Indian youth. This is why we have taken up the ‘Student Connect’ programme to reach out to youngsters,” Mulay said. 
 
 Though the state will soon have eight operational PSKs, it will still lag behind other states in terms of delivery on account of police verification report (PVR). Except for Kolkata, where PVR times have come down drastically to 13-15 days because of the use of m-passport app, the waiting time is 71 days in the rest of the state. On the other hand, it is only three-four days in  .
 
 He said that passports are undergoing complete metamorphosis, both in terms of security features and looks. “We have already simplified the passport application and PVR. There is the option for an orphan to have a passport without giving details of parents. We are also making passports for children of single parents who do not wish to name the former spouse,” Mulay said.
