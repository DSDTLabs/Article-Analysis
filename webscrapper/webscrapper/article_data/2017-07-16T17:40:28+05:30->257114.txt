NEW DELHI: India's newly-appointed head coach   is likely to be paid between Rs 7 cr to Rs 7.5 cr per year, according to sources.

 
 
 "BCCI is going to make an offer of more than Rs 7 crore to Shastri. This is the same amount which (predecessor)   had asked from the board during his presentation in May. But it can't be more than Rs 7.5 crore annually," a top functionary told TOI on Saturday. Shastri's earlier package as team director was also between Rs 7 to 7.5 crore, which included the compensation for skipping media commitments. Sources also said the core support staff, meaning the batting, bowling and fielding coaches who are going to work with Shastri, won't be making more than Rs 2 crore annually. "The support staff bracket (batting and bowling coach) won't exceed the Rs 2 cr mark. The board is in the process of finalizing contracts as soon as possible," the official added.
 
 
 
 This will, however, be a substantial hike for the likes of   (incumbent batting coach) and, if appointed,  , who is Shastri's preferred choice as full-time bowling coach.
 
 "Bangar had quit his IPL job at Kings XI Punjab and if Arun comes in he will also have to let go of his roles with RCB and the Hyderabad Ranji team," added the source.
 
 
 
 Rahul Dravid's contract for the India 'A' and U-19 teams is worth Rs 4.5 crore for the first year and Rs 5 crore in the second. He will make extra as overseas batting consultant. However, the board is still undecided on  's status as consulting bowling coach. "There is no clarity on how many days Zaheer will be available. His salary will be based on his availability," the official said while adding that the board had rejected Zaheer's 100-day demand for Rs 4 crore annually last year.
