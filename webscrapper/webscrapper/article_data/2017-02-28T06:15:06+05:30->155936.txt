GUWAHATI: Assam Police grilled former Congress minister   at its SB office premises in Kahilipara here on Monday in connection with the   Assam Public Service Commission (APSC)  . Roy was summoned earlier by the investigating Dibrugarh Police, who quizzed him for at least four hours. 

 A police source said Roy came under the scanner because of his proximity to accused APSC former chairman Rakesh Paul, who has already been arrested. "Roy is believed to be close to Paul. He also allegedly played a major role in backing Paul as the chairperson of the commission," sources said.
 
 He also allegedly fixed the selection of at least 10 candidates with the Paul's help earlier. Roy allegedly brokered deals with a number of senior Congress leaders to ensure jobs for their candidates for lakhs of rupees. However, sources have not yet confirmed whether Roy would be treated as an accused or a witness in the case. Roy, however, abstained from commenting before the media on Monday. 
 
 "Roy has been asked to re-appear before the police on March 18," sources added.
