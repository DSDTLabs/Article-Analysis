AHMEDABAD: With its demands regarding the Goods and   (GST) rates remaining unresolved despite several representations made to both state and central governments,   (GCA) has decided to launch an   from Sunday. “As many as 5,000 contractors who take up only government construction projects will stop work on such projects across the state,” said Arvind Patel, the president of the   which has more than 2,500 members. “This will affect road, flyover, and building construction works worth Rs 50,000 crore across Gujarat.” These contractors are not against the   but they fear huge losses in executing ongoing projects on account of high rates of the GST. “Public construction works now attract 18% GST whereas contractors had to pay only 0.6% work contract tax as they enjoyed service tax exemption in the previous tax regime,” Patel said. “As far as new projects are concerned, we may factor in high GST rates while bidding,” Patel said. 

 Contractors from across India are also protesting high GST rates. “Contractors from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Punjab have already declared their support for our strike,” Patel said. “They are mulling similar action to voice their concerns.” Apart from GST, these contractors are also protesting against significant increase in royalty and permit rates by the government.“However, for ongoing projects, the difference in tax after the implementation of the GST works out to be 10%-12% even after availing 5-8% input tax credit on materials. It is almost impossible for us to operate ongoing projects with such high rates, especially when our margins are just 5%-7%.” Contractors are demanding that as far as ongoing projects are concerned the government should reimburse the differential amount arising out of the change in tax rates after the implementation of the GST.
