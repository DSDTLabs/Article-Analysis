Nashik: An   that was found with a fractured wing is undergoing treatment with Eco Echo, an NGO working for animals.

 “Last week, the bird was spotted by a lieutenant colonel in the Artillery Centre. He thought that the bird will be okay after being fed. But that did not help, so he got in touch with us. We noticed an injury in its wings and brought it to the veterinary polyclinic, where we found out that its wings were fractured. We do not know the reason for the injury,” said animal activist   of Eco Echo.
 
 The Oriental honey buzzard looks like a kite but is larger in size. It is a slender species of kite. They are generally greyish-brown with a grey head, the colour of the under body ranges from cream to blackish-brown. They have scale-like feathers around the eyes and forehead and straight claws. The bird has often been traced in the Nashik region but this is the first time that it has been rescued in the city.
 
 Also known as the crested honey buzzard, this bird of prey usually inhabits woodlands and prefers board-leaved forests. City-based activists have no clue how the bird was found at a residential area or how it got injured.
 
 Veterinary doctor   operated on the bird, which is currently undergoing treatment. 
 
 “The Oriental honey buzzard has been rescued for the first time in the city. We immediately informed range forest officer   and got the rescue registered with the forest department. The bird is in a better condition now and is recovering. It will take another 10 days for us to release it as it is still not in a condition to be on its own,” Mahale said.
