CHANDIGARH: In a maiden initiative, Haryana government has proposed to set up a separate department for the welfare of ex-servicemen. The decision has been taken considering the fact that every 10th soldier in the country belongs to Haryana. The new independent department has been named ‘Sainik and  .’

 An announcement regarding the setting up of a separate department was made by finance minister Captain Abhimanyu while presenting the budget in the state assembly on Monday. 
 
 The idea of a separate ministry or department for the military   was first set down in the election manifestos of political parties contesting state assembly polls in Punjab. While Punjab Congress chief Captain   had promised to set up a separate ministry to look after the issues of veterans under the chief minister, AAP had promised to constitute a separate department for ex-servicemen.
 
 While announcing the setting up of a separate department, the minister told the House that ex gratia given to a martyr’s family had been increased to Rs 50 lakh and scholarship to cadets from Haryana studying in   (RIMC), Dehradun, to Rs 50,000 per annum.
 
 Giving details of other schemes for the veterans, the finance minister said that an international level war memorial was being set up in Ambala. He also announced to launch a new scheme from fiscal 2017-18 of free coaching for the dependents of ex-servicemen, soldiers and paramilitary forces for various competitive examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, Haryana Public Service Commission, banking services and other competitive examinations for engineering and medical courses.
