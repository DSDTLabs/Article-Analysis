 State transport minister Diwakar Raote has also written to union minister Nitin Gadkari asking him to reconsider revision of fees. Raote has also requested all transporters to withdraw the agitation for January 31.
 
 "The transporters are also protesting against frequent increase in diesel prices, delay in renewal of fitness certificate from RTOs, irregularities at border check posts and increased taxes. We will take a final call about the stir on Monday," said BGTA general secretary Jitendra R Parikh. If the truck owners join the stir, it could affect the supply of vegetables, fruits and few essential commodities to Mumbai.
