We joined the DMK and other secular parties on drought issue and together we gave a call for bandh on April 25. That's our approach.
 
  
 
 
 No. On people's issues we come together. For electoral alliances, we have to consider economic, social issues, corruption. When either DMK or   come to power, they implement the same policies pursued by either Congress or the BJP. On social issues, the DMK, AIADMK have given up what Periyar fought for. So on social issues also we cannot agree with them. On corruption, we don't see any difference. 
 
  
 
 
 It may be his opinion, but it is not the opinion of the CPM.
 
  
 
 
 We don't agree that only because a party has representation in assembly, it is an indication of growth. That's not a yardstick. In TN, more than any other political party, CPM has taken up people's issues. Our struggle on the Thamirabarani river (supplying water to multinationals) issue is an example.
 
  
 
 
 We have to fight the BJP on cultural, ideological and all fronts. We cannot fight them only in elections. Regional parties like DMK and AIADMK have, in the past, participated with the BJP in the Centre. In the future, one can't tell what they will do.
