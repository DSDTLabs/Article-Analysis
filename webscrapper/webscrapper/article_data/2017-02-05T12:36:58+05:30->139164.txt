NAGPUR: A committee formed by the state government to suggest policy inputs for freshwater fishing rights has failed to satisfy fishermen cooperatives in the state.

 On Saturday, Sangharsh Vahini staged a protest and burned copies of the   report at Samvidhan Square. They later handed over a memorandum to the district collector.
 
 A one-page document that came into being in 1960 is apparently the only legislation passed till date to regulate fishermen’s rights in the state. The 14 clauses in it decide the destiny of lakhs of fishermen who survive on fishing in state-controlled water bodies.
 
 “There was hope that the Chandraprakash Committee appointed by the government would give justice to poor fishermen. But the committee report is once again in favour of rich contractors, who can invest large sums on maintaining water bodies,” said Sangharsha Vahini’s Mukund Adewar. They have rejected the report and asked the government to scrap it.
 
 Mannu Datta, leader of fishermen’s action committee said the report ignored the United Nation Food and Agriculture Organisation’s recommendation that local fishermen’s interests be protected in any policy with the support of strong legislation.
 
 “Fresh trouble for fishing cooperative societies started in 2014 after the then Congress-led government came out with a GR allowing registration of fresh cooperatives. This was protested by the older ones. In May this year, the GR was scrapped and the Devendra Fadnavis-led government promised to come out with the first-ever comprehensive policy for fishing cooperatives and leasing rights,” he said.
 
 “The committee has not come out with any fresh idea. On the other hand, it favours auctioning to the highest bidder for large reservoirs like Pench and Gosikurd to contractors who can invest heavily is seeding operations and other maintenance works,” he said.
