Bicholim: Workers of the Sesa Goa mining company have been on protest since March 22 against the company’s decision to retrench workers. Members of the workers’ association say the decision of the management, to display a notice directing its workers not to report to work since mining activities had been halted, is “illegal”.  A delegation of the association, led by its president Nilesh Karbotkar, met Sesa Goa manager Muttumari. They also met divisional labour commissioner at Vasco in this matter. tnn
