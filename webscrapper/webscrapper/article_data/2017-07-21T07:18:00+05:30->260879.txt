Hoshiarpur: Even as the paddy transplantation process is till on, the Hoshiarpur administration has in advance banned the use of   that do not have super straw management system (SSMS) fitted on them. Though, the harvesting season is still months away, the administration has issued the orders now so that farmers get ample time to adopt the new technology. Awareness campaigns will be run in coming days and doubts of stockholders cleared, Hoshiarpur DC Vipul Ujjwal said.

 During the last harvesting season, the Haryana and Punjab governments had used real-time satellite imagery to detect cases of wheat stubble burning and levied fines on farmers who burnt the crop residue in their fields. A lot of farmers had, however, criticized the move saying that instead of offering some cheap and viable alternative to stubble burning, the governments were busy penalizing them. 
 
 The deputy commissioners have started issuing orders invoking Section 14 of CrPC prohibiting harvesting of paddy with combine harvesters without SSMS. The orders would cover those machines also which would be brought to the districts from outside.
 
 Ujjwal said that the orders were being issued as per directions issued by the Supreme Court, the Delhi high court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has developed SSMS, which can be fitted behind the combine harvester. It chops the stubble into fine dust which can be mixed with the soil in the fields using rotavator machine. Only those combine harvester machines would be allowed to operate which would have this system attached,” he said.
 
 Meeting would be held with owners of harvesting machines to create awareness and to guide them, the DC said. “The step is being taken when harvesting is still a few months away and the owners of the harvesting machines have time to get the new system fitted,” he added.
