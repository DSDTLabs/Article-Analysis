CHENNAI: A 34-year-old woman lab assistant was battling for life on Monday after her employer poured a flammable liquid on her and set her ablaze at a diagnostic centre in   on Sunday night.

 Admitted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, A Yamuna was left with 46% burns, a police officer said.
 
 Raja, the proprietor of   in  , arrested by the Madipakkam police and charged with attempted murder, told investigators that he was angry with Yamuna because she had been slack at work.
 
 “Raja said he lost his temper with Yamuna because she handed a customer someone else’s report,” the officer said. “But he claimed that Yamuna set herself on fire. His statement does not add up, given accounts from Yamuna’s family.”
 
 “They said   had in fact expressed satisfaction with the job she had been doing after she joined four months ago and even promised to give her a better position and a raise,” he said. “But Raja did not keep his word.”
 
 Raja also said Yamuna’s ineptitude caused him losses in business. “But Raja and Yamuna knew each other for a long time. They once worked together as lab assistants at a private hospital before he set up the diagnostic centre a few years ago,” the officer said. “He is unlikely to have hired her and offered her more pay if she was incompetent.”
 
 Yamuna and her husband, Anandan, a taxi driver, live in  ,  , and have a daughter of four.   said his wife had never complained to him about her boss. No one would have guessed that Raja harboured a murderous intent toward Yamuna till 9.15pm on Sunday.
 
 “Yamuna ran out of the diagnostic centre ablaze and screaming,” the officer said. “People nearby rushed her to the hospital.”
 
 Vanuvampet resident   recalled her horror at the sight of Yamuna on fire. “Only Raja and Yamuna were in the centre on Sunday night,” she said.
