MUMBAI: The travel time between   and   on   line is set to reduce by 10-15 minutes as the   plans to increase the speed of its trains on the stretch north of Mankhurd. 

 CR runs a total of 188 services between CSMT-Panvel and 79 between CSMT-Belapur. 
 
 CR's divisional railway manager SK Jain said, "We plan to increase the speed limit between Mankhurd and Panvel to 105 kmph from the existing 80 kmph." This will reduce the travel time between CSMT and Panvel to 65-70 minutes, from the present 80 minutes. 
 
 Sources said the speed on CSMT-Mankhurd section cannot be increased as the distance between two stations are too short because of which train cannot touch top speed and slow down soon after. Besides, there are slums along tracks in   section where trespassing is a major issue. Besides presence of several level crossing gates on Chunabhatti-Kurla-Tilak Nagar stretch brings down the train speed.
