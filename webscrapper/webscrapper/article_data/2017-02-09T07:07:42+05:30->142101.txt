BENGALURU: Footpath stretches under Namma Metro elevated corridors and near stations will wear a new look by next year. A renovation project undertaken by   and   (BMRC) seeks to redevelop the pavements to provide senior citizens and physcially challenged persons easy access to Metro stations.

 Most of these footpaths are narrow and in poor shape. The upgradation work has already begun on MG Road, and will be replicated along the length of the elevated corridors, which extend up to 35 kms.
 
 B Prabhakar, executive engineer (major roads special division), BBMP, told TOI BMRC has already deposited Rs 15.7 crore for the Rs 40-crore project. 
 
 “The main idea is to improve accessibility to stations by repairing/redeveloping the foothpaths. In many areas with Metro connectivity, the sidewalks are very narrow, and due to the missing slabs and links, Metro commuters face hardships. The project will be completed in phases as there are eight major road stretches to be covered. It’s expected to be completed within 18 months,” he added.
 
 Asked whether the footpath development would be taken up under the model of TenderSURE (Specifications for Urban Roads Execution), a senior BBMP official said they will concentrate only on revamping pavements for now. “TenderSURE work needs a lot of investment and it is time consuming. Since the Metro stations are already witnessing huge footfalls, our immediate concern is to develop the footpaths. Only on MG Road, we will lay utility ducts as it is a premier street and we can’t be taking up infrastructure work every now and then. Footpath-digging for laying of ducts has already commenced on the Anil Kumble Circle side,” he explained.
 
 It may be noted that the Purple Line of Metro Phase 1, connecting east and west Bengaluru, has an elevated corridor extending up to 13 kms and the Green Line, running from north to south, has an elevated stretch of 20 kms.
