Vasco: Vasco police arrested a native of Uttar Pradesh for attempting to break into a bungalow of a Mormugao Planning and Development Authority employee, located at Jairamnagar, Dabolim, on Monday. 

 Rajesh Parsekar, in his complaint, stated that he saw two men trying to break into the main door of his house as he returned home on Monday afternoon. Upon seeing him, the duo fled, leaving their two-wheeler behind. They had, however, already broken into Parsekar’s servants’ quarters before attempting to enter his residence.
 
 Police were able to trace one of the accused, Mukesh Malvi, 35, after they contacted the owner of the scooter, who informed them that the two-wheeler had been rented out to him. 
 
 Malvi was detained by Monday evening. Gold worth Rs 8,000 and cash amounting to Rs 15,000 were recovered. Police are on the lookout for the second accused.
 
 Investigations were carried out under the guidance of Vasco PI Nolasco Raposo.
