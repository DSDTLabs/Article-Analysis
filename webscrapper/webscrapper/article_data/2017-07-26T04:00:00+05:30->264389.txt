Vadodara: The rainfall data for the city so far was whatever was registered at the observatory of the M S University located in the Sayajigunj area of the city. But now it is possible to record data at five different locations in the city and then take an average of the city.

 The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is recording data in each zone of the city and at Dandiabazaar. The system has become possible due to automatic weather monitoring equipment installed at five locations in the city by the civic body. The VMC records rainfall and other weather data at stations located in the east, west, north and south zones of the city as well as Dandiabazaar in the city.
 
 Apart from the weather stations in the city, the civic body also monitors weather data at Tajpura, Gopipura and Ajwa reservoir outside the city. This is done as these three stations are at locations from where rain water flows into the Ajwa and Pratappura reservoirs.
 
 The system was installed in the city about in 2015 after the city faced a flood-like situation in 2014. It is, however, being monitored keenly this year and data is being shared with the entire engineering and other staffers of the civic body.
 
 Officials said that the advantage of recording data at different locations is that the officials can do necessary interventions based on the quantum of rainfall. For instance, on Friday, the Dandiabazaar station recorded a rainfall of only 78mm while the north zone recorded a rainfall of 115mm. If the difference is extreme the civic body can mobilise is resources to the worst affected areas to take care of the situation there.
 
 The data is available on a mobile phone application to VMC officials enabling them to get realtime information.
