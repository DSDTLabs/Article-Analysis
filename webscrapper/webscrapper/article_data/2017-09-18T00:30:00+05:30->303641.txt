Mandya: There was chaos on the Mysuru-Bengaluru national highway on Sunday, with lakhs of devotees thronging  , to take a holy dip in the Cauvery river, as part of the ongoing 12-day   celebrations. As a result, thousands of tourists who were coming to the city from Bengaluru, were held up on the road, for hours together.

 According to the Srirangapatna police, since early morning itself, lakhs of devotees from various parts of the state and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, started coming to Srirangapatna to take a holy dip in the Cauvery river. Due to traffic congestion, a majority of the devotees were unable to take a dip at the bathing ghats built by organisers. They instead went into the river from surrounding areas, and took a holy dip and offered prayers.
 
 Due to a shortage of space in parking lots, devotees were forced to park their vehicles on either side of the national highway, resulting in chaos on the Mysuru-Bengaluru national highway, till evening. Thousands of tourists coming to the city, bore the burnt of a traffic jam. According to the police, vehicles were held up on a stretch of more than 3 kilometres in either direction, due to a slow movement of traffic in and around Srirangapatna.
 
 DC Manjushri, assistant commissioner Yashoda, additional SP Lavanya and other senior officials came to Srirangapatna to oversee traffic management. Raghavendra, a city resident who was travelling to Bengaluru, said traffic was very slow on the Mysuru-Bengaluru national highway, till evening. "Generally, on weekends, the highways witness a huge volume of traffic, but, today, it is in a chaotic state. Buses took around four-and-a-half hours to reach Bengaluru from the city," he said. 
 
 Food shortage
 
 As the number of devotees crossed lakhs, Pushkara organisers were forced to close down their free-meal counters early. As a result, devotees were forced to depend on private restaurants.
