NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Saturday launched a project of   under the banner of ‘MCD Aapke Dwar’ from South Extension. Under the initiative, officials and leaders of the civic body will visit different areas and hear the grievances of the people.

 The project falls on similar lines of Aam Aadmi Party’s mohalla sabha.
 
 “The main aim of this initiative is to understand the problems of the public and to resolve their complaints. Hundreds of residents from South Extension participated in the interactive session and a number of local issues were resolved on the spot by concerned officials,” Tiwari said.
 
 Slamming the AAP-led Delhi government, Tiwari further said, “We are shocked to learn that even developed colonies like South Ex are facing water shortage and sewage issues. Chief minister Kejriwal should focus on development of Delhi rather than indulging in political gimmicks.”
 
 The Delhi BJP chief believed that the initiative launched by   would be taken forward by the other two civic bodies as well.
 
 SDMC mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat, during her visit to South Extension, proposed to utilise properties of the civic body that are lying vacant.   said that a meeting was set up with RWA members and on a pilot-basis, SDMC has decided to convert the existing baarat ghar into a recreational centre for senior citizens.
 
 Sehrawat said that in every locality of SDMC, unused properties would be identified and the corporation would then develop it as per the requirement of the local public. “We will direct zonal officials to compile a list of properties that are under-utilised or are lying vacant and as per demands of the local residents of that area, the property will be redeveloped,” the mayor added.
