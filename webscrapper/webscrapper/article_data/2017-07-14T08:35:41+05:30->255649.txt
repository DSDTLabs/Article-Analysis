MUMBAI: The comedy group   ( ), which had last year found itself at the centre of a controversy for its promoter  's "roast" on cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and singer Lata Mangeshkar, may have just landed in trouble again. 

  After AIB tweeted on Wednesday a meme about Prime Minister   by using the Snapchat dog filter, a Twitter user, Reetesh Maheshwari, wrote to the Mumbai police handle, calling the meme an "obnoxious prank" which ought to invite legal action. 
 
 The Mumbai police's cyber police station at the Bandra-Kurla Complex is probing the matter.
 
  Maheshwari also wrote on the handle of the Mumbai police commissioner: "Pradhan Mantri ke liye is taike ka behuda Mazak par @AllIndiaBakchod and @thetanmay par sakt karwayi hona chahiye." AIB later removed the tweet with the meme on the PM. 
 
 Bhat, co-founder of AIB, defended the meme in a post on the group's website and also took to Twitter to make his case, complaining about what he called "the lack of rational reasoning."
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Akbar Pathan said they were verifying the matter and collecting more information. 
 
  Mumbai police had last year also received several complaints about the use of abusive language in an AIB show held in the city. 
 
  A court directed the police to file FIRs against the show's organisers and prominent participants, citing violation of the Indian Penal Code sections dealing with conspiracy and obscenity. An FIR was filed against 14 persons in Pune as well.
