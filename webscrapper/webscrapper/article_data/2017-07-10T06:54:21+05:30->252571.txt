HYDERABAD: Elected representatives of   district are daggers drawn over the location of Ranga Reddy district headquarter (collectorate). While some MLAs want the collectorate at Shamshabad, the other group wants it at Tukkuguda and Raviryala, which is close to the   (ORR). 

 With controversy raging, roads and buildings (R&B) department, which has finalized tenders for new collectorates in almost all districts, has not been able to take up tender process for Ranga Reddy. R&B minister Tummala Nageshwara Rao and Ranga Reddy district minister P Mahender Reddy (now belongs to Vikarabad district) refused to be drawn into the row.
 
 Ranga Reddy district has been functioning from its collectorate complex at Lakdikapul. Earlier, there was a demand to shift it to Chevella as the current collectorate in Hyderabad district area should be in the jurisdiction of Ranga Reddy district. After reorganization of districts, the erstwhile Ranga Reddy district was divided into Ranga Reddy, Medchal and Vikarabad districts.
 
 Few MLAs are seeking the new collectorate either on Agriculture University land at Rajendranagar or at Shamshabad.
 
 "We have suggested RR collectorate should come up at Rajendranagar or Huda Colony near Shamshabad. These areas are convenient to people with good transportation facility," Rajendranagar MLA T Prakash Goud said.
 
 Few others say the new collectorate should be at Tukkuguda or Bonguluru junction abutting the ORR.
 
 The two warring groups met chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who directed chief secretary SP Singh and special chief secretary (Revenue) BR Meena to sort out the issue. Following directions of the CM, the MLAs and officials visited Raviryal and   for site inspection.
 
 "A meeting is expected to be held with the chief minister. We are trying to   a consensus among elected representatives," a senior official of Ranga Reddy district told TOI.
