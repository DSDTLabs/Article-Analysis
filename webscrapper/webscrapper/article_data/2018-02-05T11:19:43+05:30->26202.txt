BHUBANESWAR: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has started psychological counselling of students to help them beat examination stress. Several schools are organizing remedial classes and have asked students not to abstain from using social media during exams. 

 "We are taking special remedial classes so that students can clear their doubts. Sample papers are being practiced on a daily basis. Teachers have been following up with students over phone on their preparation," said principal of Kendriya Vidyalaya-1 A T Mishra. He added that even parents have been counselled on food and sleep patterns of their children. With the reintroduction of Class X board examination by CBSE, many students are jittery. Earlier, answer sheets would be checked in schools which was a relief, said a teacher. 
 
 Some schools are also helping students destress through yoga and meditation. "Keeping cool is very important for students. So it is advisable not to waste time on social media. They should take a break and listen to music or watch TV " said Isha Satpathy, counsellor of DAV Public School, Chandrasekharpur. Students can dial a toll-free CBSE helpline number 1800 11 8004, where general queries will be answered and they will be connected to principals or counsellors in case of anxiety or stress.
