KOCHI:   here removed a 4cm-long   in a 61-year-old man's tongue for the last 30 years. 

 On February 10, MS Mathai had come home on a holiday from  , where he works as a vehicle showroom coordinator. He noticed swelling in the tongue and had difficulty eating or drinking. Doctors at first suspected that he had symptoms of tongue cancer.
 
 "Thirty years ago, when he was eating fish curry, rice at a restaurant in   in 1988, a fish bone got stuck in his tongue. Since then sometimes he had swelling in the tongue, which subsided with antibiotics in a few days. But this was the first time that he had severe pain and couldn't drink or eat," said Mathai's wife Aniamma.
 
 Mathai, who was discharged from the hospital on Sunday said, "Over the years, I consulted several doctors and all of them prescribed antibiotics and it gave me temporary relief," said Mathai.
 
 They doctors decided to perform a surgery mainly to rule out any source of infection and found the fish-bone almost one to one-and-a-half centimetre inside from surface of the tongue. "Though the patient always had some discomfort, nobody thought that it could be because of the fishbone stuck in the tongue 30 years ago. Had the bone remained there, there were possibilities of developing cancer due to chronic trauma," added Dr Shawn. Incidentally, the bone couldn't be detected in the MRI.
