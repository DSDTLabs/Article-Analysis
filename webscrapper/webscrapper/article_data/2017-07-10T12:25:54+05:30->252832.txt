KOLKATA: After sifting through hundreds of photographs of lovable cats – as well as their rescue stories – the judges for   (PETA)   contest have selected 10 finalists, including Licky, whose guardian is Kolkata resident  . She rescued him after he was left under the water tank on her terrace. After receiving plenty of love and care, he became a part of the family.
 
 "He was abandoned when he was barely 3 weeks old. His other siblings were missing. It was during a winter afternoon that we heard his feeble meows and located him," says Das. "We took him in and fed him. From that day onwards, Licky became family. My parents got a son, and I got a baby brother."
  
 "Licky is a lucky cat, indeed, and he has returned the favour of being rescued by bringing much love and joy into his guardian's life," says PETA India CEO Dr Manilal Valliyate. "All rescued cats are already winners because their lives were saved by people who love them for who they are."
  
 PETA India is holding the contest to encourage prospective guardians to adopt animals from the streets or shelters instead of buying them from pet shops or breeders, as these facilities often keep animals in dismal conditions and contribute to the homeless-animal overpopulation crisis. Animals in pet shops are also often bought on impulse and discarded when buyers tire of them.
  
 The guardian of the lucky kitty who is named the   will receive a certificate, a copy of Ingrid Newkirk and Jane Ratcliffe's book One Can Make a Difference, a "My Cat Is a Rescue" T-shirt, a PETA T-shirt, and a cute cat toy. The second-place winner's guardian will receive a certificate, a copy of the book, a "My Cat Is a Rescue" T-shirt, and a cat toy. The third-place winner will receive a certificate, a copy of the book, and a cat toy. The top three kitties will appear in an upcoming issue of Animal Times, PETA India's magazine for members.
