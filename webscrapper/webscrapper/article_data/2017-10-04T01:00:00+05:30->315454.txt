Actor   clearly believes in quality over quantity, and doesn’t mind waiting for the right role. Last seen in ' ' over a year ago, he says, “Today, I am in a position where I can be a bit choosy, and I don’t want to be a mere prop. Earlier, anybody could become an actor; they just had to be good-looking. Similarly, these days, anybody can become a producer. People just want to make money, even if it is at the cost of quality. I don’t want the makers of a show to choose me because I come cheaper than the rest. I want them to approach me for my talent and the fact that I can carry a show on my shoulders. I am looking at quality work.”

 Interestingly, Romit never wanted to become a TV actor, he entered the industry hoping to make it big in films. He elaborates, “I took up art films in the beginning of my career and was averse to working on TV. However, when it happened, I gave it my all. I was doing two shows at a time when the news of actors fainting on the sets while shooting for just one show were surfacing.”
 
 Romit is now in talks for shows with a couple of producers. Ask him if he feels there are not enough roles for actors his age and he says, “I am in the best phase of my life. A mature actor is more nuanced in terms of acting and screen presence. In fact, I am more excited now than before. I don’t mind playing a father and don’t appreciate actors who refuse to colour their hair grey when they age on screen. It’s our job to look the part.”
 
 Meanwhile, the actor is making the most of his free time. Over the past month, he has spent quite a lot of time at Matheran, learning horse riding. “It’s relaxing, but not as easy as it looks. The posture is extremely important as otherwise, you might end up injuring your back,” Romit says.
