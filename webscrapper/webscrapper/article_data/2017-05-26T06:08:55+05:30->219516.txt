 The state social justice department is trying to arrange a night shelter, as part of its   project and has sought space in the   in  .
 
 Women reaching the city during the day can stay overnight at the shelter and leave the next day. It will be the second such   in the state, after the one in Kozhikode opened a year ago.
 
 The social justice department preferred to find space in the complex considering its proximity to both the bus terminal and the central railway station. The department officials have already approached the   Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC), entrusted with the construction of the terminal.
 
 The department is seeking 1,382 square feet area on the eighth floor of the building for the 20-bed facility, which would function from 7 pm to 7 am.
 
 “We had noticed many women spending the night on the platform of the railway station and bus terminal and such a facility will benefit them. We are planning a 20-bed facility, but could accommodate more women. If all goes well, we may open the night shelter in the next three months,” said an official from Social justice department.
 
 The rent, and terms and conditions are being discussed with the KTDFC.
 
 Two other government agencies have agreed to the rent and terms and conductions to occupy space. A 3000 sq ft each will be occupied by Kerala State Remote Sensing and Environment Centre on the 10th floor and the directorate of national savings will occupy the eighth floor.   (KSFDC) has also approached KTDFC to acquire space for a movie hall on the third floor.
 
 Meanwhile, KTDFC will open tenders for renting out commercial space from the ground floor to fourth floor of the building on Friday. Only four applications for tenders have been received in the seventh tender invitation for occupying space at the building.
