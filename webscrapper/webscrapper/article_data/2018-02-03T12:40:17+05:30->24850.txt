CHENNAI: In less than a year since its inauguration, the cycle track in   seems to have turned away more cyclists than it has accommodated, with many shying away fearing personal safety.

 The 3.8-km track,  's first-of-its-kind facility, is now littered with potholes forcing pedestrians and cyclists back onto the road. The patronage from school students, which the corporation had banked on, has also vanished after many children tripped on the potholes and suffered injuries.
 
 But the corporation appears nonchalant. In the third week of December last year, social activist   wrote to commissioner   about the serious problem. "Till date, there has been no visible positive change. There has been no response from the concerned department," said Narayanan.
 
 Last month, he said, he wrote again to the commissioner. Corporation officials attached to Zone 10 ( ) told TOI that the potholes appeared after the electricity board and   undertook service repairs. However, maintenance repairs were not undertaken in time. "We will repair the minor damages soon," said a corporation official. But the cycle track has suffered major damages too. Ramps that allow entry on to the track and bollards to prevent vehicle parking have gone missing.
