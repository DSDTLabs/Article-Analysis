JALANDHAR: The   ( ), which has around 27,000 members across Punjab, has alleged that manufacturing of spurious milk and milk products was widely prevailing in the state. It alleged that recently when its members led some health department officials to the manufacturer of spurious desi ghee in  , they in a bid to protect the owner of the unit let him escape just before the raid.

 The association has also announced to take up the issue with the chief minister and health minister. “The   are being manufactured by using chemicals, including those which are injurious to human health. But most of the big fish still remain out of the police and health department net,” said PDFA president Daljit Singh Sadarpura in the presence of other office-bearers of the association from across the state during a press conference here on Thursday.
 
 They also alleged that certain wrong doings were also being done at a Kharar-based laboratory of the department. “We will now pursue the issue with the chief minister and health minister to make them aware how department officials are working due to which the menace of spurious products was spreading unchecked,” PDFA members said, adding that the same person was manufacturing spurious desi ghee at four places. “Such products could be causing cancer and other serious ailments,” they said.
 
 Moreover, the PDFA claimed that the rates at which the   purchased desi ghee and skimmed milk last year could not be viable for quality products at all. “The SGPC purchased desi ghee from a Haryana firm at Rs 340 per kg while its cost of production could not be possible below Rs 380-390 per kg. Similarly, it purchased skimmed milk at rate of Rs 186 per kg but pure milk powder was not available below Rs 260 per kg,” PDFA president Daljit Singh Sadarpura and other members claimed.
