AHMEDABAD: The state government is aiming to cut down the powers of town planning officers to reduce chances of corruption. In a few days, a major amendment in the  , 1976, that of Section 49 (2) will come into force. The amended provision will not allow wilful deviation from the preliminary draft Town Planning scheme sent to the government for approval and as displayed in public domain. Sources in the urban development department claim that the move will open a Pandora’s box.

 Sources in the urban development department claim that the amendment was necessitated after alleged malpractices by TPOs to shift an entire final plot into the neighbouring original plot of some other owner, including government land were noticed. 
 
 “Sometimes a landowner pursued the TPO to shift his entire plot away from a EWS housing reservation plot in a draft TP scheme and even reduce their land deductions,” said a senior official of the  . Normally it took a total of 49 months between declaration of intention to undertake a TP scheme and its sanction by the state government. It was during this period that such adjustments were made by the TPO.
 
 The position of the TPO is quasi-judicial and his role is that of an arbitrator whenever a TP scheme is laid. 
 
 Usually, most of the decisions are taken and finalized by the TPO. Except for compensation and contribution related issues in case of plots, none of the decisions of the TPO can be challenged. 
 
 It is reported that a lot of changes occurred in the overall physical layout of the TPS at this stage as a result of individual negotiations between the landowners and the TPO. 
 
 “The scope of corruption is still there. For instance, now the TPO can position a reserved plot for EWS housing near an owner’s plot and then demand a sum to remove the reservation from the draft scheme. Also, individual plot owners will now have to rush to the state government for adjustments,” said a senior   (AUDA).
