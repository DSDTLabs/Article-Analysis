DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has formed a panel to ensure strict adherence to river rafting norms by raft operators and to take action against those who flout guidelines by overcharging or filling up the raft beyond capacity. 

  The panel ' ' will be headed by district magistrate Tehri, Indudhar Bodai, with the sub-divisional magistrate as vice-president and the district tourism officer as member secretary. Six members, three each from two rafting associations, will also be a part of it. The rafting association members will catch those flouting norms and report it to the committee. Talking to TOI,   said, "Action will be taken on the information by rafting association members. The offenders may stand to lose licence. The action recommended will be forwarded to the   (UTDB)." 
 
  Bodai said that the government lacks the manpower and other resources to clamp down on offenders hence the rafting operators have been roped in to nab offenders. District tourism officer   said that according to guidelines, no more than eight tourists and a guide can get into a boat. Those below 14 years of age are not allowed to go rafting and life jackets and helmets should be available, Rana said. Rana said that many rafting operators were running their business without a licence so it would be made mandatory for rafts to bear their registration number. 
 
  Dhanender Rawat , president of Uttaranchal Finest Outdoor Association, who is part of the committee, said, "Those who run the business illegally do not pay the licence fee and do not follow safety measures which brings the sport a bad name. Some offenders run many rafts under one licence or operate in Ganga on a licence which is permitted for other rivers or have no licence at all." 
 
  The committee will also seek funds from the tourism department to develop pick up and drop points including building of roads, cafeteria etc near rafting spots.
