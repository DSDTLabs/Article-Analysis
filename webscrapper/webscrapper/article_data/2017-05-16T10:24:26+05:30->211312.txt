Madurai: Unable to find work on a long term basis,   from the city have knocked on the doors of the Madurai district collector’s office seeking a solution to their problem.

 Their petition comes at a time when they are losing their to jobs due to tepid construction sector due to increase in cost of materials like sand, cement and steel, and also due to those from other states, who take away whatever little work is left in the city.
 
 They said that contractors prefer workers from other states as they work for extended hours for lesser wages and are often picked for bigger projects in the city.
 
 The workers complained that even if they are willing to compromise on their wages, there is hardly any employment for more than 15 days in a month. With work days in a month dwindling, they are forced to approach loan sharks to run their families.
 
 B Jayapandi, a mason from the city said, “There was a time when masons dictated terms, but at present many are committing suicide due to unemployment. I am ready to lower my wage to Rs 500 a day from Rs 700, but still there is no job. I am struggling to run my family and educate my two little daughters,” he said.
 
 K Maruthupandi, a construction labourer said roping workers from other states has become big menace for them. 
 
 “We want the district administration to ensure that work is allotted to locals as well. If 500 workers are required, at least 300 locals must be employed to ensure that our families do no suffer,” he said.
