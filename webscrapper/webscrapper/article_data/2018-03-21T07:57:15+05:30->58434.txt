BENGALURU:   near   on Sunday witnessed the death of more than 150 fish. 

 Residents say the fish were healthy on Saturday night. They suspect the recent rain may have brought in sewage water, and depletion of oxygen levels due to rising heat may have proved fatal.
 
 Some residents said sewage was entering the lake due to a damaged sewage chamber nearby. Though the leakage was fixed, the dirty water entering the lake may have done the damage.
 
 Usha Rajagopalan, trustee of the citizen-driven  , said they consulted the fisheries department on fish deaths and suggested installation of aerators to increase the levels of dissolved oxygen. 
 
 "Though the number of dead fish is less compared to some other lakes where the problem is severe, we as caretakers of the lake are a little worried and taking necessary steps to prevent such cases," she added.
