Actor  , who split from wife   last year, was photographed enjoying a coffee date with a mystery woman in Los Angeles.

  
  
 The two were seen at a coffee cafe location in Los Angeles on Wednesday where there were lots of smiles and a warm hug.
 
 He wore a dark ensemble of a zip-up black athletic jacket, faded black jeans and light grey sneakers on the outing, concealing his celebrity identity a bit under a black ball-cap and black sunglasses. He sported plenty of stubble as he made his way to the meet-up. 
 
 Pratt's friend on the outing had long blonde hair and wore a dark coat with a purse on the chilly   day.
 
 It was not immediately clear if the meeting between the woman and Pratt was a romantic one as it came more than six months after the actor and Faris announced they were separating.
