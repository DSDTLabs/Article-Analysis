PUNE: There is expected to be a spike in   activity on collector’s lands in Pune, as well as rest of the state, with the government recently slashing the redevelopment premium from 25% to 10%.

 In April 2017, the state had framed a policy allowing additional floor space index (FSI) on payment of a premium — 25% of the ready reckoner (RR) — for the redevelopment of leasehold and Class II properties on government-owned lands. This decision was met with stiff opposition from the housing societies, and the rates were slashed to 5% in case of educational or public trusts in Mumbai and 2.5% in other places across the state. Moreover, the premium for housing societies was recently slashed to 10%.
 
 However, while housing societies will have to pay a reduced redevelopment premium, developers, who are into cluster redevelopment or slum rehabilitation, will continue to pay 25%. This is because the FSI is already high for these schemes. These schemes get 4FSI as against regular redevelopment, which can get a maximum 2.7FSI.
 
 A drive has been initiated by the revenue officials to check for re-development activities carried out without permission. “For Pune, we have received only a couple of proposals for re-development on collector’s lands. With the premiums being slashed, many more proposals are expected. However, we are checking for encroachments and re-development activities carried out without permission,” said a revenue official. “A slash in the premium was needed to make redevelopment more viable. Also, we were not able to collect the premium announced last year because of the high rate,” he said.
 
 However, revenue officials added that while there will be a spurt in redevelopment activity, revenue generation is likely to take a hit. “The slashing of rates will not help fill up state coffers,” said another official.
