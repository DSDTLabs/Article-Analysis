GURUGRAM: Three delivery boys who once worked for a logistics firm engaged with online retail company   are among four people arrested for stealing goods in transit. 

 Police said the four used to order goods from Snapdeal using logins with fake names and addresses, then replace the items with stones and soap and return the parcels.
 
 The four — Ravikant, Hariom, Amrit and Karan Sharma, all from Delhi — were produced in a Gurgaon court on Thursday and sent to judicial custody.
 
  The Udyog Vihar police station had started an investigation last month after a complaint from Ramesh Kumar, area manager of Vulcan Express Pvt Ltd, the logistics firm that delivers products purchased from Snapdeal to different parts of the city. During probe, the police found the thieves were the delivery boys hired by the logistics firm.
 
 On Monday, two delivery boys Ravikant and Hariom were arrested. The duo revealed that Karan, the elder brother of Hariom, had hatched the plan. “Karan used to place orders for expensive goods from and choose cash-on-delivery option. He tied up with the delivery boys who handed them over to Karan. The delivery boys then returned the parcels to the company, saying that the address was incorrect. The delivery boys claimed they got 15% of the value of goods as commission,” said ASI Anil Kumar.
 
 The police picked up Karan in Gurugram on Tuesday, and another delivery boy Amrit in Delhi on Wednesday. “They have replaced over 50 parcels and sold them on  ,” DCP (crime) Sumit Kuhar said.
