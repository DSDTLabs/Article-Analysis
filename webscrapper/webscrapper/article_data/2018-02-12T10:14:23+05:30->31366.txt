 An engineer by profession Sanjeev and his wife Archana Tripathi, who is a handicraft artisan have been collecting trash from the premises of Chandra Shekhar Azad (CSA) Park for years and dispose them after segregating them into recycled, non-recycled and waste food products in separate bags.
 
  officials said the couple have been selected as Swachhata brand ambassadors as an acknowledgement of the efforts to maintain cleanliness in many parts of the city including CSA park, Civil Lines, Darbhanga colony and adjoining areas.
 
 Sanjeev said, "We are encouraging people to maintain cleanliness in and around their surroundings."
 
 The engineer said they had launched an awareness campaign to curb the use of polythene, thermacol and plastic-made utensils especially at birthdays and marriage ceremonies.
 
 A handicraft artisan Archana said, " We have been urging citizens that they should never throw waste in the open and instead should give it to garbage-collection vehicles. These vehicles have separate green and blue boxes for dry and wet garbage and go from house-to-house."
 
 Allahabad mayor Abhilasha Gupta and municipal commissioner Harikesh Chaurasia appreciated the couple's efforts and said that every individual should contribute to keep the surroundings clean and green.
 
 The couple, however, stressed that there is still a need to create mass-level awareness among Allahabad locals to keep their soundings clean and green. "Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created awareness over the issue, the society has undoubtedly witnessed some change but we still have a long way to go." Sanjeev said.
