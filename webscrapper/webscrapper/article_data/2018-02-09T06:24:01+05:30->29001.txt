AHMEDABAD: In a recent   for  , involving   from the  , some vital issues were raised. 

 The committee felt that some of the principal issues that dog our traffic management involved lack of infrastructure, because of unavailability of land, road and parking spaces, and a negotiable common space. The officials also pointed out that the existing motor vehicles act and rules is not a deterrent any more as citizens continue to flout them and that stricter laws should be enforced. 
 
 
  
  
 The team felt that the new Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2017, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 23, should be adopted with immediate effect. This involves higher fines for traffic violations and more teeth to authorities to act against traffic offenders. 
 
 Another issue identified was that at most crossings, there exists a manual management of traffic junction by deploying traffic police which turns out to be the “most unscientific”.
 
 The traffic police authorities had argued that there exists more than 65% vacancy in their department and with the addition of 2.3 lakh vehicles every year, it has become tough for the policemen to depute staff immediately to troubled spots. 
 
 “Even if we have CCTV cameras up at all major junctions, we will not be able to attend to an emerging traffic jam scenario in time. Traffic police deployment should be proportional to vehicle and population growth,” admits a senior traffic official. 
 
 A recent Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology survey for Ahmedabad had revealed that on some of the busy road stretches, an average of close to 5,000 to 9,400 vehicles pass by in an hour in an 18-hour cycle.
