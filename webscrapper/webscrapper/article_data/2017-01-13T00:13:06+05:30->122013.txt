Nashik: Traffic moved at a snail’s pace as high drama prevailed on the busy MG Road when the   (ZP) officials razed a disputed construction of an electronic shop on Thursday. 

 In 2009, the ZP had leased out space on 11-month lease along the MG Road. After the completion of the lease period, the shopkeeper concerned was supposed to vacate the place. However, despite various notices, the shopkeeper did not remove the structure. The   was finally bulldozed by the ZP, though the shopkeeper attempted to prolong the demolition process by telling the authorities that he was getting a stay order.
 
 Sources from the ZP said the trader was not willing to vacate the place after the lease period and went to the district court and even the high court. Since his prayers were rejected in the courts, the ZP administration on November 26 served him a month’s notice to remove the structure. 
 
 The action of razing the structure began at 10.30am, though the lease owners kept on telling the authorities that the stay order on the demolition would soon arrive. Sources from ZP said considering the approach of the trader, they had already filed a caveat in the district court, which is a formal request to the court to refrain from issuing any order on the issue before hearing their side. 
 
 Cchief executive officer of the Nashik ZP Milind Shambharkar was unavailable for comment over the issue. Senior police inspector Seetaram Kolhe of the Sarkarwada police station said that the demolition continued from 10.30 am to 4pm. 
 
 He said the major concern of the police was to ensure smooth flow of traffic on the busy road, which got affected for some time due to the presence of huge crowd at the demolition site. 
 
 Senior ZP officials said the trader was given permission to set up a pandal at the location at the time of the agreement. However, he had made a concrete construction and started selling electronic items.
