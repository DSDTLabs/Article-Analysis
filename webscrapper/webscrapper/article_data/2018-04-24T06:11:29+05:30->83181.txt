KOLKATA: A group of 10 transgender activists, including members from the community, have submitted a deputation to the secretary of the West Bengal Transgender Development Board on Monday asking for removal of   from the post of vicechairperson. The move came after three days of agitation at the   in front of the Academy of Fine Arts.

 Ranjita Sinha, a member of the board, said: “Manabi has been spreading wrong information about us. She refuses to acknowledge April 15 as Transgender Day. Instead of working for the entire community, she chooses to promote only those who are close to her. We want immediate removal of her from the board with a show-cause notice.”
 
 Atri Kar, a member of the transgender community, said: “Twice I had asked her to help me. But she didn’t do anything. She is not doing justice to her post and needs to step down immediately.”
 
 Bandopadhyay, however, has no immediate intentions of doing so. “I think there is a conspiracy against me. However, I believe that everyone has the democratic right to give a deputation. Allegations can always be made. But they need to substantiate with proof. I will respond if there is an investigation.”
 
 Anurag Maitrayee, a social activist from the community, said, “Manabi has made insensitive comments towards the transgender community when there was an assault on us at the Ranu Chhaya Mancha on April 15. We have lodged a general diary at Hastings police station.”
 
 Asked about this alleged assault on transgenders, Bandopadhyay, however, said, “The matter is sub judice. I won’t speak about it.”
