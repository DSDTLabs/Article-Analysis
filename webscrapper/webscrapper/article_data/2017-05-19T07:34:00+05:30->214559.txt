PATIALA: The   (AIPEF) has opposed the move by the   (BBMB) to recruit its own class I and II officers by proposing amendments to its recruitment rules. The issue will be taken up during the next board meeting of the   on Friday.

 The AIPEF alleged that the proposed agenda item was only for increasing the cadre strength of BBMB officers, which would harm/decrease the rights of officers of partner states/power utilities’ in a very insidious manner. It has requested all board members that the proposed amendments should be nipped in the bud and declined by them. It also stated that board members must be sensitized about the hidden potential harmful affects of creating such a large number of BBMB cadre posts. 
 
 The federation has stated that if any partner state of the BBMB refused or expressed inability to send personnel on deputation, even in that case personnel could be taken from partner states and not by creating a separate BBMB cadre. “When there is an awful low level of unemployment in the partner states, these must not lose employment generation potential to a caretaker agency,” AIPEF office-bearers stated
