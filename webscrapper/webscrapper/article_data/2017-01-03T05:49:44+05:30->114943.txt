MUMBAI: Chief minister   along with   chief   inaugurated a portrait of late social reformer   in the BMC general body meeting hall on Monday.

 Prabodhankar was the father of Sena founder late  . While speaking at the function after unveiling the portrait, Uddhav thanked BJP for supporting Shiv Sena in completing its five-year term in the civic body . He also seemed confident of his party's chances of winning the civic election.
 
 However, Fadnavis avoided make any comments related to the elections or his party's alliance with the Sena during his speech. The Sena-BJP alliance has been ruling over the BMC since the last 20 years. After BJP's impressive performance in the parliament and assembly elections, the party began exploring the possibility of contesting the civic polls separately. The BMC polls are scheduled in February and the Shiv Sena and BJP are yet to decide if they will fight the election jointly.
 
 There has been some friction among the allies as BJP has pinned the blame for irregularities in the civic body on the Sena. However, the Sena says it exposed corruption in the road works, which landed two chief engineers in the jail.
