KOLKATA: The eastern zone branch of the   ( ) on Monday directed the   to take adequate precautions while dumping or moving soil excavated from project sites so as not to cause pollution. The   has also been directed to keep tabs on such activity and report back to the court. 

 The NGT was hearing an application by environment activist Subhas Datta against air pollution in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Pollution due to the unplanned dumping of excavated soil by agencies engaged by   Railway, primarily for the E-W Metro corridor, was one of the points mentioned in the application. 
 
 “When the bench wanted to know where Metro proposes to dump the soil, their counsel mentioned Kamardanga and Makardah in Howrah. These are urban locations and I pointed out that soil can’t be dumped there without carrying out environmental impact assessments (EIAs). The court directed the Metro to do the needful and take clearances,” Datta said. 
 
 The bench also referred to how the NGT’s principal bench in New Delhi had imposed fines on several organisations for causing pollution. The court was displeased when Datta informed that even wet soil is moved in uncovered trucks. 
 
 “Such material should not be carried in open vehicles. The soil should be covered with polythene sheets,” the bench directed. Both the Metro and WBPCB will have to file affidavits on the matter before the next hearing.
