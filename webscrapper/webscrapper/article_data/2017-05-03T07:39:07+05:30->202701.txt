AHMEDABAD: Parents of a student of   in   have complained to the District Education Officer (DEO), alleging that the school authorities had asked them to pay for a school leaving certificate for their daughter. According to the parents, the school authorities had demanded Rs 8,500 for issuing a school leaving certificate. According to the rules, no school can charge a student or parent for issuing a school leaving certificate.

 Ashish Thakkar, father of the class 9 student, has stated in his complaint that when exams were under way in April, the school had announced that if a student wishes to change school, an application must be submitted around April end. “At that time, we were not keen on changing her school. Later, however, when we decided to do so, the school demanded payment,” Thakkar has stated in his complaint.
 
 “We produced before the school authorities all the receipts of fees paid till date but they refused to issue a leaving certificate without payment,” Thakkar has alleged.
 
 DEO will investigate the matter further and take appropriate action against the school if allegations are found to be true.
