Vadodara: Voices of dissent have started surfacing ahead of the 66th annual convocation of M S University in which President Ram Nath Kovind has consented to remain present as chief guest on Monday. 

 Senate member from Faculty of Social Work Kapil Joshi on Friday wrote an open letter addressed to the President requesting him to decline the invitation extended by the university and demanding that the President’s office should direct Gujarat governor to appoint an independent inquiry into functioning of the office of MSU vice-chancellor (VC). 
 
 In a series of allegations, Joshi alleged that MSU VC professor Parimal Vyas has violated basic norms, statutes and ordinances governing the appointments in the university and that he is involved in financial irregularities to the tune of Rs 10 crore. 
 
 He further alleged that Vyas who had cleared his Masters in Commerce (MCom) with just 55 % marks has openly violated guidelines of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) by obtaining dual professorship in Faculty of Management Studies where the minimum eligibility criteria is securing a first class at post-graduate level. 
 
 To draw attention, Joshi shared Vyas’ mark sheet and degree certificate which was conferred upon him after he passed his masters studies in April 1984. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that university officials have earlier rubbished allegations levelled by Joshi stating that the dual professorship which was conferred to Vyas is not a position by appointment but a status conferred by the university which was granted during the tenure of former VC professor Yogesh Singh.
