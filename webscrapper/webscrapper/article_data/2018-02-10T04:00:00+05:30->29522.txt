Chennai: Poor demand growth in its key markets coupled with lower price realization resulted in The India Cements Ltd (ICL) reporting that it earned a net profit Rs 15 crore as against Rs 35 crore earlier. The figures aren’t comparable as some subsidiaries of the company was merged with itself last year. Total income for the quarter was Rs 1,217 crore. “This was the most challenging quarter. A period when fuel cost rose, pet coke usage was marred by uncertainity, demand in Tamil Nadu, (a key market for the company) was subdued due to lack of availability of sand,” said N Srinivasan, vice chairman and MD of the company. Net plant realization for the quarter fell to Rs 3,275 per tonne as against Rs 3,475 sequentially. The company operated its plants at 70% of rated capacity, same as before.
