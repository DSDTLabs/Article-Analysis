New Delhi: The ambitious   of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is working, though with some glitches.

 In the first ever review of the scheme, conducted by the office of SDMC commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel on Monday, it was found that not all the 40   — who had adopted the corporation’s free-for-use toilets — had visited the units.
 
 The scheme mandated the officials — adopting the toilets — to visit them regularly and ensure that they remain clean and well maintained.
 
 Under Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan the civic body pays utmost attention to cleanliness and maintenance of toilets. It was with this purpose that the civic body came up with the idea of officials adopting toilets in their respective areas. 
 
 The officials are supposed to inform their juniors, directly responsible for toilet cleanliness in their wards, if they find anything lacking. 
 
 The   has 181 community toilets, 483 urinal blocks and 203 waterless urinals across its area of jurisdiction. However, despite 40 officials adopting the toilets and promising to supervise their cleanliness and maintenance, many of the toilets remain dirty.
 
 South corporation public relations officer Mukesh Yadav said the commissioner has asked all the 40 Class I officials to start visiting the toilets regularly and make sure these are well-maintained.
