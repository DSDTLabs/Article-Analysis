Vadodara: Cops flouting the traffic rules in the city will have to pay double the penalty amount now. City police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar has issued orders asking the traffic cops to penalize the policemen found flouting any traffic rule.  “I have asked them to collect double the penalty amount from the cops who are not following traffic rules. The policemen should be more responsible and follow all the rules,” Sashidhar said. The top cop wants to send a strong message to the police officials, many of whom are seen driving motorbikes without wearing helmets.  The traffic cops are issuing on spot challans to the policemen. The move came after the police recently began reissuing e-challans to the citizens flouting traffic rules. CCTVs installed on the main roads are being used to identify and penalize the traffic offenders. Congress leaders opposed the e-challans and asked the civic authorities to improve the roads and remove encroachments first. Some even pointed out that the cops themselves don’t wear helmets while driving and also talk on mobile phones.  The decision to collect double penalty from the cops is expected to have a positive effect on citizens.
