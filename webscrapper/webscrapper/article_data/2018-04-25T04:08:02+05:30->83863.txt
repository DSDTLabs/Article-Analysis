THANE: In one of the biggest   rescue operations in the recent times, the forest department on Tuesday raided two illegal pet shops in Mumbra and found 79 protected bird species.

 Acting on a tip-off, the members of a city-based NGO, Wildlife Welfare, spent the past week recceing Mumbra’s   to confirm that the shops were selling various species of rare birds that are protected under the Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act.
 
 From plum headed parakeet and scaly breasted munia to purple swamphen and even migratory ruddy shellduck, activists found the birds in a shabby condition in cages on the footpath outside the Royal Pet clinic and immediately informed the forest department. “An activist informed us about the sale of protected birds in   corner area and we spent seven days finding out everything about it. When the illegal activities were confirmed, we requested the forest department to raid the area,” said  , president, WWA.
 
 Around 2.30pm on Tuesday, a team of 20 officials from the state reserve police force and the Thane circle of the forest department, along with WWA members and Mumbra police officers, seized the birds during a three-hour long drive.
 
 “We have also caught hold of two employees of the store who are being questioned. We are trying to ascertain whether the birds came fromand since how long is this going on,” said S J Lachake, assistance conservator of forests (Thane).
