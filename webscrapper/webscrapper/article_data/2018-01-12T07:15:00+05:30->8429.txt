GHAZIABAD: An elderly woman was robbed of her   bracelets worth over Rs 1 lakh by two men who posed as cops in   on Thursday afternoon.

 The robbery occurred around 12.45pm when   (65), wife of a retired railway employee, was on her way home in Raj Nagar’s Sector 8 on a cycle rickshaw. When she was just a kilometre away from her home, two bike-borne men stopped her. They introduced themselves as cops and scolded her for wearing expensive ornaments. They snatched her bracelets and put them in her purse after wrapping them in a piece of paper. After reaching home she realised that the originals bangles had been exchanged with artificial ones.
 
 “They cornered me after shooing away the rickshaw puller. They reprimanded me for wearing gold ornaments, saying so many robberies take place in the area. I did not know how to react. They wanted me to remove my earrings as well, but I refused to do so. I raised my voice to attract public attention, but no one came to my help. The men subsequently left the spot. I did not realise I had been robbed until I reached home,” said Kashyap.
 
 A call to the police control room was made and later the woman lodged a complaint with the   police station. SHO (Kavi Nagar)   said an FIR under Section 420 ( ) of the IPC has been lodged and the matter is being investigated.
