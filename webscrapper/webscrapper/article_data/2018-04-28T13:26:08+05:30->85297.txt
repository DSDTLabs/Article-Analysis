Surat: Next time you have any issues relating to passport application,  , then you will have to take an online appointment to meet regional passport officer (RPO) from May 1. 

 At present, passport seekers have to take an online appointment from official passport seva portal to submit their documents at Passport Seva   ( ). Now, the RPO has made it mandatory to seek online appointment to visit passport officer for enquiry related to passport, pending passport applications and submission of applications falling under complex category etc. 
 
 Also, those wanting to meet passport officer will have to visit the RPO office at   along with mandatory documents. The applicant should visit RPO Surat along with application reference number (ARN) sheet and no applicant will be entertained without prior appointment.
 
 Sources said the new rule is a part of RPO setting up and organizing a digital platform for improving citizen experience at the PSK and at the RPO office at Umara. However, for most of the applicants, mainly senior citizens and illiterate applicants, online appointment will add to their cost and time. 
 
  activist   said, “There was a system followed at the RPO office for applicants visiting the passport officer. Now, the online appointment to meet the passport officer will be a bit cumbersome for the applicants. RPO is a public servant appointed by Government of India and he should be always available to resolve the issues faced by the applicants.”
