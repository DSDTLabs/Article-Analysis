SECUNDERABAD : In a classic case of biting off more than they can chew ahead of   elections in 2020, both TRS and   are going all-out to woo 35,000 residents whose very voting right is in doubt after the SCB officials established that they would lose voting right since they had encroached upon defence land. 

  official spokesperson  , who is visiting various wards and talking to residents, said he will file a writ plea on behalf of the voters against deleting their names from the voter list. 
 
 "Enumeration of voters will be completed soon and we are planning to approach the defence officials to protect their right to vote. If necessary, I will file a writ petition in the court," Krishank told TOI. Along with his followers, he visited Mudfort, Lal Bazar, Anna Nagar, Rasoolpura and Bolarum recently to assure the voters not to lose heart. 
 
 As per the   order, people who encroach upon defence land in Cantonment will lose their voting right and cannot exercise their franchise in Cantonment Board elections. 
 
  G Sayanna, who won on TDP ticket but later joined TRS, is also touring wards to assure the voters. His first aim is to fix electric meters in every household in the encroached land. 
 
 Sources said for both the parties, these 35,000 votes are crucial in the SCB elections.
