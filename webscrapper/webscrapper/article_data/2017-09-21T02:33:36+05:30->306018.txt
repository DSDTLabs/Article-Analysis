NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will probe the serious case of a   aircraft overshooting the runway in Mumbai on Tuesday night and then getting stuck in mud. Both the pilots of the   737 operating this Varanasi-Mumbai flight SG 703 have been grounded pending the probe, said senior   ( ) officials.

 With one runway close, flights to and from Mumbai — which anyway suffers a crippling shortage of airport infra — are badly affected hit. Top aviation authorities in Delhi who are closely coordinating attempts to remove the disabled aircraft from the runway say the “stuck portion of the plane was lifted twice on Wednesday but each time it dropped back to the ground”. 
 
 The stuck portion of the plane was finally brought out late on Wednesday night.
 
 “The agencies doing the recovery job, including  , tried to insert steel plates in the ground below the aircraft so that the equipment used to raise the plane does not go down in the extremely soggy ground,” said a DGCA source. AI has a disabled recovery kit which is being used to clear Mumbai’s main runway.
 
 The commander of the SpiceJet aircraft was an expat, from Indonesia. 
 
 Sources in the airline say the plane’s skidding was not the crew’s fault. 
 
 “Why did the airport allow planes to fly into the city in such adverse weather when the runway could have got slippery,” said a source. SpiceJet has reportedly asked its grounded expat captain to remain in India till probe is over. 
 
 Whether the crew is at fault or not will be known after the probe.
