CHENNAI: AIADMK general secretary   on Wednesday urged prime minister   to promulgate an ordinance to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to enable conduct of Jallikattu this year.

 In a letter to Modi, Sasikala said the lifting of ban on Jallikattu would be the ultimate joy for Tamils, not only in Tamil Nadu, but across the world, which would ensure that the people of Tamil Nadu really celebrate the   with traditional fervor and gaiety.
 
 “I request you to kindly intervene in the matter to promulgate an ordinance to amend the PCA Act, to denotify the bulls from the notification of the ministry of environment and forests, so as to lift the ban on jallikattu and preserve TN’s culture and tradition,” she said, pointing to “widespread resentment in the state against the ban.”
 
 The AIADMK leader said the sporting event was inextricably linked to the rural, agrarian customs, practices, and psyche of the Tamils and also helps in the conservation of native germplasm, since bulls with excellent physical attributes alone were reared for the sport.
 
 AIADMK MPs led by deputy speaker of Lok Sabha, M Thambidurai met Union minister of state for environment, forests, and climate change and presented a memorandum of Sasikala, seeking to amend the provisions of PCA Act to hold jallikattu. Later, they also presented the copy to Sasikala’s letter to prime minister’s office.
