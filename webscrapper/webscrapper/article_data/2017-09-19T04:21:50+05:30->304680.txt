NEW DELHI: Boosting career prospects for soldiers, the government has finally approved the third cadre review for junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and other ranks in the around 12-lakh strong Army. 

 The increase in number of higher ranks for the 11.49 lakh soldiers in the Army, which has around 41,000 officers, will be implemented in a phased manner over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. “While this will be carried out without an actual increase in the Army’s overall prescribed manpower, it will not apply to any new raisings of battalions separately approved by the government,” said an official. 
 
 The cadre review will see 479 new   Major posts being added to the existing 5,500 ones in the Army, while there will be 7,769 new Subedars (existing 44,546) and 13,466 Naib Subedars (existing 41,014). The force will also get 58,493 new Havildars (existing 2,10,656) and 64,930 Naiks (2,03,259). “The review was needed as there has been a sharp increase in the induction of advanced weapon systems and new technologies in the Army,” said the official.
