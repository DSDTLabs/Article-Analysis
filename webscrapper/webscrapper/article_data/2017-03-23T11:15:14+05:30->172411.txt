INDORE: The anti-evasion wing of the commercial   department raided premises of several stationery and cosmetics dealers in Indore on Wednesday over suspected tax evasion.

 The team of over 40   officials raided premises and godowns of these dealers. Investigation is expected to continue for three more days.
 
 Leading the investigation, deputy commissioner Dharmpal Sharma, said, “We had received many complaints about these dealers. We gathered information about these firms and then conducted raids at their shops and houses.”
 
 Sharma said that the investigation has been carried out under the directions of the commercial tax commissioner Raghvendra Singh.
 
 The department conducted raids on Mahesh Marketing, Krapal Stationery, Sagar traders and Jai Shiv traders all from Khajuri bazaar.
 
 Sharma said, “These firms were found to be involved in tax evasion. We found they were using parallel bills and there were mismatches in stock.”
 
 Investigating officers are studying the stocks at these firms and the final penalty will be assessed once the investigation is over.
 
 According to the officials, study of the documents sealed from the   premises will help in disclosing more facts and details of tax evasion.
 
 Sharma said, “We have received complaints about irregularities in these firms’ books of accounts. We also suspect mismatch in stocks at these firms.”
 
 The mismatch in stocks means that the firms have been involved in selling goods on parallel bills to evade tax.
 
 The commercial tax department is targeting firms involved in tax evasion.
