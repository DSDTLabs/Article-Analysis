SHIMLA: In stark contrast to the Jallikattu uprising in  , people of   complied with the court order banning animal sacrifice in places of religious worship despite having reservations on the issue.There were no large-scale agitations as those who opposed the move took legal recourse instead.

 “In Himachal too, people are not ready to part with the age-old tradition of sacrificing animals to their deities, but they fear holding protest demonstrations like in Tamil Nadu. We thus took the legal route to address our issue,“ said Dot Ram Thakur, president of   Devi Devta Kardar Sangh.
 
 Thakur along with Kullu royal  , moved court against the order.
 
 After the   court's ban on animal sacrifice at all places of religious worship on September 1, 2014, Himachal's famed “assembly of gods“ was held, wherein “deities“ were said to have refused to accept the court ban on animal sacrifice. However, the court prevailed and peaceful implementation of the order was ensured.
 
 Barring a few isolated instances, animal sacrifices have been replaced by offering coconuts in temples.
