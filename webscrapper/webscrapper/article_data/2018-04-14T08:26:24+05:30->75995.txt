CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister  , in a press release on Friday has stated that all party MLAs would be accommodated either as ministers or legislative assistants or as chairmen of boards and corporations during the proposed cabinet expansion. 

 Meanwhile, the   (AAP) has questioned the move and called it unconstitutional.
 
 Amarinder has defended his government's move to install legislative assistants, saying that with 42 departments, it was not possible for the ministers to handle the work alone. He said he would be meeting Congress president   in the next few days and expected most of the remaining sanctioned posts to be filled up in this round of the expansion.
 
 On the other hand, AAP leader   said, "To appoint Congress MLAs as legislative assistants with independent portfolios and powers of ministers is nothing but making mockery of the Constitution provision that doesn't allow more than 15% ministers of the strength of the Vidhan Sabha."
