Ludhiana: Eight days after an LPG cylinder burst at a house in Samrat Colony in Giaspura, three people who were injured in the blast breathed their last on Friday, taking the death toll in the tragedy to 10. 

 The deceased include house owner Ashok Yadav (58), and his neighbours Rakesh Kumar (45) and Kamlesh Giri.
