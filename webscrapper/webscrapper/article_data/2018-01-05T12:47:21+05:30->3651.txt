VIJAYAWADA: Aiming to provide experiential tourism for people, the government has sanctioned 2 crore for implementing a 3D projection mapping on the   Fort. The fort is situated 16km from   and is the most sought-after tourist destination in the district. It stands as a monument of the glory of many dynasties. 

 The Andhra Pradesh tourism department has got the approval of CM Chandrababu Naidu for renovating the historical site by adding the 3D projection mapping.
 
 Speaking to TOI, principal secretary of tourism & culture   said that the government had presented the concept to the CM at the previous board meeting. "The entire idea was inspired by the one performed at the   in New Delhi. We are planning to tell the story of Kondapalli fort through the 3D projection mapping which is the first of its kind in Andhra Pradesh," Meena said.
 
 Meena also said that 4 crore was sanctioned by the CM for providing other amenities like parking, food courts and other facilities of recreation. The 3D projection mapping, also known as spatial augmented reality, will be a sound and light show. The officials are proposing to conduct the show at the dancing hall which can accommodate a large number of audience and the projection can be put on the pillars. 
 
 Officials did make it clear that they are looking at 3D mapping artists who can tell the tale in the best possible creative manner. "As of now, it's still in the initial stages. We are looking at a few persons and are taking the help of other state tourism departments in implementing them," Meena added.
