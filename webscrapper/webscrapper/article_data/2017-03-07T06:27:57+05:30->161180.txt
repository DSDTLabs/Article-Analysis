LUCKNOW/VARANASI: As he made his marathon six-hour journey through the twisting, cramped bylanes of Varanasi, from Lanka to Kalibhairo and Vishwanath Temple on Saturday, SP supremo   Yadav would have felt he was riding his luck.

 After all, this is the second time the Yadav scion had got his favourite rath made at and moved from Chandigarh to Lucknow.
 
 “I got this rath made from a place near Chandigarh. The best part about the man who makes my raths is that woh jiska bhi rath banate hai, sarkaar usi ki banti hai,“ Akhilesh told TOI. “I had got this same rath made even in 2012.This time, I got two of them made there“ he adds.
 
 Described as such, the rath may conjure up images of mythical heroes astride horse-drawn chariots, but the vehicle on which Akhilesh has set out on his poll conquest is actually a modified Mercedes Benz bus.
 
 It contains Bluetooth-enabled devices and a 10-feet hydraulic lift that Akhilesh can use to get a better view of the crowd. It also comes with a dais that can accomodate 15 people.
 
 The bus has see-through as well as tinted windows and is even equipped with a bed for resting apart from a dinner table and a toilet.
 
 Over the last six months, after the bus arrived in Lucknow, Akhilesh has held more than a dozen roadshows atop it.
 
 In fact, one of his posters shows him as a gladiator coming out of the bus.
 
 “We love the music blaring out of this bus and AKhilesh's face was much more visible to us than when he travels in a car.
 
 “I think people prefer these modern campaigns where their netas can be seen more often on the roads,“ said a Varanasi local who attended AkhileshRahul's roadshow.
