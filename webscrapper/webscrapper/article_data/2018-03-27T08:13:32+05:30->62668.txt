JAIPUR: That   would not lead   in the forthcoming   season was a foregone conclusion immediately after his admission of ball-tampering. It was always a question of when he would stand down. The announcement to that effect came on Monday, and as expected Ajinkya Rahane was named as the Royals skipper in their comeback season.

 
 The question that still remains is whether Smith would be available for the Royals this season. Sources in the franchise informed TOI that as of now, Smith’s contract remains intact. However, that could change depending on the punishment that Cricket Australia (CA) hands out. Royals management could well be lining up a replacement, perhaps talking to someone like Joe Root to fill the vacancy.
 
 “The incident in Cape Town has certainly disturbed the cricket world. We have been in constant touch with the BCCI and taken their counsel. Furthermore we have been in regular contact with Steve,” Royals head of cricket Zubin Bharucha said in a release, adding, “It’s in the best interest of the Rajasthan Royals that he steps down as captain so the team can get ready for the start of the IPL without the ongoing distractions.”
 
 “Rajasthan Royals will do everything possible to protect the values and the integrity of the game,” Royals co-owner Manoj Badale said, “We agree with Steve’s decision to step down as captain, and we are fortunate to have such a capable successor in Rahane.”
