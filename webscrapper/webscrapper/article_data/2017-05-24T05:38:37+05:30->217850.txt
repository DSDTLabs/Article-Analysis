CHENNAI: A young boy crumples in pain holding his feet. At once, two others materialise on either side, hoist him up and carry him off to a safe zone to  . They turn to another injured classmate who appears to have a burn injury. Attending to him, they turn objects within easy reach - like a handkerchief - into emergency aid tools. 

 The smallest one then hops off and runs away, signalling the end of the drill. These young boys and girls from Nettukuppam middle school in Ennore are now disaster managers in their own right. 
 
 Nearly 2,700 students like these, from across corporation schools in the north Chennai zones of Tiruvottiyur and Manali, go through weekly lessons in managing all kinds of disasters. Ranging from ages 8 to 15, many of these children hail from families of fishermen and labourers.
 
 “Earthquakes, fires, floods, stampede…” trails off 12-year-old Bhuvaneswari, recalling the calamities they’ve been trained to face. From tying knots to drawing up an evacuation plan for their school, the students have been trained by volunteers from  , which kick-started the project to educate children in vulnerable areas of the city. 
 
 With help from the local fire stations and St John’s ambulance services, the NGO has managed to get students to assess vulnerabilities in their schools and plug those gaps, by closing an open well or repairing cracks in buildings. 
 
 Having stared at disaster from close quarters, the importance of the exercise is not lost on the kids. “All our possessions were affected by the water, my books were all damaged,” says Neelavathy, a 12-year-old studying in Manali government school, recalling the December 2015 floods. “But now I know exactly how to protect my belongings if it happens again,” she confidently declares.
