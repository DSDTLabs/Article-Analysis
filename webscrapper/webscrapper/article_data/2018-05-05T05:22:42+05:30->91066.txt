NAGPUR: Forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Wednesday called for introduction of electric and battery-operated vehicles for tourists in national parks and sanctuaries in a phased manner. He also rejected a proposal to shut down Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) on Tuesdays, and the   zone on every Wednesday.

 The latter decision means tourism will remain open on all days of the week. Earlier, the park used to remain closed on Tuesdays.   is the only park in the region which remains open on all seven days.
 
 The minister was addressing field directors and wildlife wing officials as chairman of executive council of Tiger Conservation Foundations (TCFs) of tiger reserves. He approved the budget for TCFs for Tadoba, Melghat, Pench, Navegaon-Nagzira, Sahyadri, and Bor. Tadoba’s   budget of Rs15 crore was also approved.
 
 The minister also gave a go-ahead to increase Navegaon-Nagzira gate fee by 10%. “We will implement the new charges from next week,” said field director Ramanujam RM.
 
 Mungantiwar also asked officials to draw up a plan to introduce BOCs in a phased manner to check vehicle pollution in the parks. He called for hospitality training to guides and asked officials to treat tourists respectfully.
 
 He also asked for a development plan for 100 villages in the buffer zone and vicinity of the park. The villages should have basic facilities. Youth in these villages should be trained in skill development to provide employment, he said. He also directed refund of money to tourists who cancel bookings well in time.
