CHENNAI: Mumbai have posted numerous come from behind wins in the past. Saturday was another day in the office. If an enterprising 117-run stand for the fifth-wicket between skipper   (83) and   (64) bailed Mumbai out of trouble in the first half of the day, a clinical bowling show saw them trump defending champs Gujarat by 98 runs in the first round of the   Trophy here at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

 Mumbai may have won the Ranji Trophy a staggering 41times but Tare feels Mumbai "have not done well" in the 50-over domestic competition over the last decade as Mumbai had last won the limited overs title in 2006-07.
 
 Tare wants his boys "to change" the trend. Gujarat opted to bowl first and India pacer   (245) made maximum use of the green patches and "moisture" on the wicket to seam the ball both ways. He scythed through the Mumbai top-order reducing them to 463. In a span of four overs, Bumrah dismissed teen sensation Prithvi Shaw (10) and the dangerous Shreyas Iyer (9).
 
 Gujarat's graciousness -spilling a catch each of   (41) and Surya Kumar Yadav (2) -didn't cost them much. But Tare and Lad not only wrestled back the initiative but made   & Co pay for not grabbing onto the two chances the duo offered during the middle phase.
 
 Lad, in particular, was severe on short-pitched deliveries and the fuller ones as he whacked as many as five sixes. The more accomplished Tare, peppered the cover fence and in the 35th over he struck three consecutive boundaries on the offside off pacer   (252).
 
 Debutant Gujarat medium-pacer Chirag Parmar (442) triggered a middle-order collapse by dismissing Tare and Lad in quick session. Mumbai eventually ended up with 273 for nine in 50 overs with Aditya S Dhumal scoring an unbeaten 32.
