The recently released trailer of 'Commando 2' has made viewers go gaga over Vidyut Jammwal’s swift stunts. After 'Commando: A One Man Army', was lauded for its electrifying action sequences, the sequel will see the actor take action a few notches higher. The film, which marks Deven Bhojani’s directorial debut, will see Vidyut playing an international spy, who is on a mission to eradicate black money. 

 Fans are impressed with the movie’s high-octane action and chase sequences, and Vidyut’s chemistry with leading ladies   and  . Adding humour to the action thriller is Adah’s character Bhavna Reddy, who is funny and entertaining with her one-liners and Hyderabadi accent. 
 Producer   says, “I am happy that the audience is loving the mix of action, romance and humour. I can confidently say that the action performed by Vidyut can’t be done even by Bond. Indians should be proud that our Bond is beating the original Bond.” Director Deven shares, “I am super excited about the trailer getting phenomenal response. Vidyut has set a new bar for action heroes, which may not be easy to surpass in near future.” 
 
 'Commando 2', presented by Reliance   and Jayantilal Gada (PEN) in association with Sunshine Pictures Pvt. Ltd., releases March 3.
