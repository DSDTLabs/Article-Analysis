MUMBAI: Plans are afoot to connect the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus ( ) subway to the Metro line III station coming up under   at Fort. 

 The   Rail Corporation Limited has written to the BMC seeking its permission to excavate two garden strips near the civic body’s headquarters where two entry and exit structures for the proposed Metro station would be constructed. The 33.5km Colaba-Bandra-Seepz line will connect Nariman Point and BKC with domestic and international airports and industrial areas like MIDC.
 
 Giving   permission would mean the footpath on Mahapalika Marg could be barricaded out of public use for a while. 
 
 Civic sources said the CSMT subway will connect with the Metro subway at two places. One would be an entry/exit along with staircase on the footpath of Mahapalika Marg, near BMC’s new administrative building and another behind the Shahid Smarak. A civic official said, “For the construction work, the site needs to be handed over to MMRCL along with the permission for excavation and demolition of existing strip garden. MMRCL has assured us to comply with all the conditions and even to reconstruct the garden as per BMC’s specifications on the same spot once the work is over.” 
 
 The official said two shops in the subway would to be affected during the construction, but subway users would not be inconvenienced.
 
 The BMC has tabled the proposal before the municipal commissioner for a final approval only after which MMRCL would be given a nod to begin work.
