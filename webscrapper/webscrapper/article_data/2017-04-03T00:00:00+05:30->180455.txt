Mollywood filmmakers are now seemingly keener to rope in people who fit the characters rather than making actors play the parts. After Action Hero Biju and Angamaly Diaries, Jayasurya’s upcoming film Captain will have a host of newcomers playing pivotal characters.

 The film, which is a biopic on former India football captain V P Sathyan, will see 75 real-life footballers as part of the cast.
 Its director   tells us, “Close to 8,500 players from various clubs across the state had applied for the audition. We conducted a camp and selected 700, out of which 75 footballers will be seen playing in various matches in the film.”
 
 The movie, which has   and Anu Sithara in the lead, also has Siddique, Deepak Parambol, Renji Panicker and Nirmal Palazhy. In addition to the actors, several coaches of Sathyan too will feature in the film.
 
 The team kicked off shooting in Kozhikode on Sunday. “In the first schedule, we are shooting portions of Sathyan’s personal life and his younger days. A few football sequences too will be canned, but the portions of professional football will be shot in Chennai and Kolkata,” says Prajesh. Malappuram and Kannur are the other locations.
 
 Jayasurya had allotted close to three months to get in shape for the character and also play the game with ease. “He’s all set right now,” says the director, adding that the actor will be seen in three getups as the story focuses on three phases of the footballer’s life.
