 Chief conservator of forest, Kutch circle, K S Randhawa said, “Badger is an endangered animal under Schedule H and its snaring or hunting is prohibited. If anybody harasses this animal, it will be considered as hunting and we will charge the culprits for attempt to hunting. Our team is in the village to identify the perpetrators.”
 
 Dr Rajesh Maheshwari, who also works for animal welfare in Kutch, said, “This badger is found in Kutch and Tharparkar in Sindh province of Pakistan. This is anthropophagous (human flesh eating) animal. There is a strong belief among villagers that it takes away infants and also digs up graves to eat the dead body.”
 
 Former   of Kutch A O Sharma said, “As badger is an endangered animal, it is the duty of forest department to protect it. But we can’t have an officer in every village. However, those responsible for harassing the badger must be brought to book.”
