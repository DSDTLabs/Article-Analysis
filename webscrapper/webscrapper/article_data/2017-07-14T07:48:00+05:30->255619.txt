Gurgaon: A Maruti Suzuki company employee was arrested on Thursday for raping a 16-year-old Class IX student for past two months. 

 According to the police, the incident came to light on Wednesday when the girl complained of severe abdominal pain. The girl’s mother rushed her to a nearby clinic where the doctor, after examination, told her that the girl was one month pregnant. When her mother enquired, the girl told her that the accused, Mohit (20), had been raping her for the past two months on the pretext of marriage. 
 
 The mother and daughter then moved the Sector 40 police station and filed a complaint against Mohit. 
 
 “Mohit and I know each other as we are neighbours. Two months ago he promised me marriage and then raped me. After that day, he often raped me when I was alone at home. He had threatened to kill me if i told anyone about it,” the survivor told cops.
 
 The girl was taken to Civil Hospital for medical examination which confirmed rape.
 
 Following her complaint, an FIR under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Section 164 of the CrPC has been registered against Mohit at Sector 40 police station. 
 
 “We have arrested the accused who has confessed to the crime. He will be produced in a city court on Friday,” said Deepak Saharan, DCP (east), Gurgaon.
