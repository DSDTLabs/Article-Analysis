NEW DELHI: India today pressed the UK for the extradition of loans defaulter and fugitive  , when the two countries' home secretaries met in New Delhi, ANI reported.

 Union Home Secretary   met his British counterpart   in the national capital today.
 
 In February, India gave a formal extradition request for Mallya through a note verbale. And last month, Mallya was arrested by   on fraud allegations, which then triggered his extradition process in the British courts. 
 
 Mallya was released on bail after he assured court he will abide by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, including surrendering his passport.
 
 Among other topics expected to have been discussed at the meeting between Mehrishi and his counterpart was counter-terror cooperation between India and the UK, sources told PTI.
 
 Issues related to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, the strengthening of the intelligence sharing mechanism and visa-related issues were also expected to have been deliberated upon, sources added.
 
 Meanwhile, a joint team of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate reached London earlier this week. They reportedly have documents to persuade lawyers of the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on the "dual criminality" of Mallya.
 
 That is, they will show he not only cheated, he also committed money laundering. And both these together, are expected to present a strong case for the former liquor baron's extradition in court later this month on May 17.
 
 While the   and the   are not parties to extradition arguments in court, the material provided by them is expected to assist CPS lawyers to counter pleas expected to be taken by Mallya to avoid extradition.
 
 "The officials will explain that here is no political motive behind Mallya's extradition request," said a source.
