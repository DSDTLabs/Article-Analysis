NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister   on Friday raised questions on the Centre for choosing   areas for the ambitious   pointing out that the area has only 2% of Delhi's population.

 Speaking at a conference on urban issues, Sisodia slammed the initiative terming as it as “half approach“ and “not inclusive“. Stating that concept of   was flawed, he asked what prevented the Central government to take up development of Karawal Nagar, Shahdara or New Seemapuri in East Delhi as a smart city , indicating that NDMC is relatively better developed.
 
 Sisodia's assertion was questioned by a urban development ministry official at the meeting who said Delhi government could, if it wanted, convert the whole of Delhi into “smart city“ if it had the resources. The smart city project was intended to have a demonstrator effect and the Delhi government had itself nominated NDMC for the selection process.
 
 “Who stopped the Delhi government from nominating the other municipal area?“ an urban development ministry official asked.
 
 Niti Aayog chief   advocated for directly elected mayors for better governance and accountability for the state of affairs in urban areas. Kant said such frequent rankings should be made public and particularly in cases where cites ranks badly so that “citizens of that city do not go back and vote the same elected government to power“.
