HYDERABAD: Cab aggregators   and   will soon have another competitor in the market. Telangana Cab Drivers' and Owners' Association is planning to launch a mobile and web application in June. The app will not have surge pricing,   said on Saturday. 

 The idea for developing an app stemmed after series of complaints and protests over alleged mismanagement by Ola and Uber. TCDOA plans to bring on board over one lakh drivers currently associated with Ola and Uber. "The app will have fixed rates for fixed distances. Price will not fluctuate throughout the day. This will provide an alternative from high surge prices charged by other cab aggregators," said V Shiva, TCDOA president.
 
 A panic button for emergency will be provided to customers and a 24*7 toll-free helpline number will be created for drivers. Police verification of all drivers will also be carried out for the safety of commuters.
 
 According to TCDOA, drivers on-duty will get a range of services such as a fixed 10-hour workday, job security, free-of-cost food at TCDOA canteens, maintenance and repair services for vehicles and medical insurance of drivers and their family. TCDOA will strike a deal with repairing centres and set up over 700 such centres.
