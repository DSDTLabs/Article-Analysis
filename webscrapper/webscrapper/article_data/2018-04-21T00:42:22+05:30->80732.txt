Tirupur: An idol was found near Rakkiyapalayam in the city recently and it was handed over to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR & CE) department. However, the police did not register any case as no idol missing complaint was lodged. They also suspect that it might have been placed in a house and worshipped, before being dumped in the public place. On Wednesday, locals found a gunny bag at Rakkiyapalayam and informed the revenue officials. The officials found an idol inside the gunny bag. The idol was made of stone with wooden part on its bottom, said a police officer. “The one-and-a-half feet high idol could be Mahalakshmi deity, dated back to many decades but only the archaeological department could find the real age. It was handed over to HR&CE department. It was kept at Rasathal Rasiannan temple at Rakkiyapalayam,” said an HR&CE official. So far, no idol missing complaint was filed in this region. So, they could not find out that whether it belonged to a temple. Moreover, they could not sense possibility of any criminal activities in connection with the idol.  The revenue officials did not lodge any complaint about it, hence no FIR was registered, said the police officer.
