NEW DELHI: Delhi saw a 9.94% increase in the number of vehicles in 2015-16. Among them, auto rickshaws clocked the highest growth at 142.72%. Interestingly, the period also saw a phenomenal annual growth in buses—74.19%, and ambulances—95.81%. These are the highlights of the   2016-17.

 According to the survey report, during 2015-16, the number of vehicles per 1,000 population was 530, a significant jump from 491 the previous year. It was only 317 a decade ago. In fact, the annual growth rate of vehicles in 2005-06 was 8.13% as opposed to 9.94% in 2015-16. The previous year it was only 6.89%. Incidentally, according to the transport department, the number of vehicles registered in Delhi has crossed the one-crore mark by December 2016.
 
 Meanwhile, the Delhi Metro has expanded its network, with phase III set to take it to over 300km. The survey reveals that the two new corridors of phase III are scheduled to become operational this year, along with the extension of line 5 to Bahadurgarh. The Dwarka-Najafgarh corridor is set to be commissioned in 2017 as well. The Economic Survey also lists the addition of 517 buses to the Delhi Metro feeder bus system.
 
 The survey shows a steady fall in the ridership of DTC buses. The average daily ridership was 35.37 lakh in 2015-16. This is a significant fall from the 46.77 lakh commuters in 2012-13 or even the 38.87 lakh who took bus rides in 2014-15. Meanwhile, the number of cluster buses in 2015-16 was 1,490 with a daily ridership of 10.61 lakh. The fleet utilisation was 98.84% in the cluster bus system as opposed to the 83.63% of DTC buses.
 
 The survey also makes a point about the   coming up with more bus rapid transit (BRT) corridors, but does not give details on these projects. It lists the Ambedkar Nagar-Moolchand BRT as an operational corridor, though it was dismantled last year. The survey says that renovation work of the Anand Vihar and Dwarka ISBTs have been handed over to PWD while work on the Sarai Kale Khan ISBT is being undertaken in two phases.
