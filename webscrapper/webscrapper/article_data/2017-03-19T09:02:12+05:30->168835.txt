JAIPUR: The state government, which sanctioned a number of private universities in the last few years, is in a bind now after complaints of issuing   started pouring in followed by inquiries.

 However, it is in no position to form a regulatory body as such powers are vested with the Centre or the UGC.
 
 Senior officials in the   department said that following a similar complaint, the Himachal Pradesh government had formed a state regulatory body which was, however, struck down by the high court on the ground that such a power was vested only with the Union government. But, this was later stayed by the Supreme Court. So there is no clarity on the issue.
 
 “We have taken up this matter with the Centre and hope that the Union HRD ministry may soon come out with a solution,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the state government will inquire into such complaints and initiate action against erring universities.
 
 As many as nine private universities are now under the scanner for issuing fake mark sheets or backdated degrees. They are OPJS University, Churu;   Bagad Rajput, Alwar); Shri Jagdish Prasad Jhavermal Tiberewala University, Chudela (Jhunjhunu); Sridhar University, Bigodana (Jhunjhunu); Singhania Universty, Pacheri Badi (Jhunjhunu); Pacific Academy of Higher Education and Research University, Udaipur; Bhagwant University, Ajmer;   university, Jaipur and Madhav University, Pindwara (Sirohi).
