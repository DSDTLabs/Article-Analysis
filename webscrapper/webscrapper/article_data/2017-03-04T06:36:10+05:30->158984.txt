 Lal Singh Yadav, the girl’s father, claimed police were not taking the matter seriously. “They have not updated us about the investigation. I went to the local police station and came to know that the investigating officer is out of town for some other criminal case. We want to know how our daughter died. The accused must be punished,” he said.
 
 The family members and relatives of Gazhal, meanwhile, have planned to organise a condolence meeting on Sunday in their society in Stellar Jeevan, Greater Noida.
