LUCKNOW: The   said on Tuesday the Supreme Court’s observation that the   should be solved with mutual consent has brought the situation back to square one. “Things have reached where it had all begun,”   state spokesman Sharad Sharma said.

 “There have been many attempts of talks but none has been successful,” he said, adding that it was for this reason that seers, saints and VHP leaders had been saying that the only solution to the Ayodhya dispute was through a legislation in Parliament. “Just like a Bill in Parliament paved the way for the construction of a grand Somnath Temple in Gujarat, a Bill should be brought in, clearing the way for the construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya,” Sharma said.
 
 He also said that VHP’s legal experts were going through the court’s suggestion, and added that hearing in the matter should be regular. “Things would become clear on the next date of hearing on March 31,” Sharma said.
 
 VHP-backed seers and saints have been demanding a legislation in Parliament for the construction of a   at Ayodhya. After the BJP government came to power at the Centre, seers and saints at a meeting in Ayodhya had given it two years before the next course of action.
