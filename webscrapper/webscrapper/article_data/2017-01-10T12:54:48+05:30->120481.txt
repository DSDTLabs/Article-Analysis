BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh’s first biomethanation plant that can generate biogas to power street lights or for other similar use, was inaugurated by mayor Alok Sharma at Bittan Market in the state capital, on Monday.

 The waste-to-energy plant will daily use municipal solid waste and produce biogas that will then be utilised to generate electricity for lighting up street lights at Bittan Market.
 
 A trial run of the biogas-powered generator to power the street lights at Bittan Market was demonstrated at the launch. The facility will become fully operational in another two weeks, said an official.
 
 It will utilise   waste, mostly from the nearby vegetable market and the adjacent colonies, to be converted into biogas. This is part of the Bhopal Smart City project and the scheme is also being linked to the Swachh Bharat initiative.
 
 The launch marks a forward leap in Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) moves for sustainable development and reduction of the city’s carbon footprint.
 
 “We are proud that Bhopal has the first waste-to-energy biomethanation plant. It will be replicated in other locations of the city,” said Sharma.
 
 The plant will be able to process four to five tonnes of segregated organic municipal solid waste daily and produce biogas. “We are in PPP mode with the private company. Once the plant attains full capacity, the methane can also be sold commercially,” said BMC additional commissioner   Singh.
 
 Construction of the plant had begun in 2015. Built for around Rs 2 crore, BMC estimates that there are over 50 hotels and 500 vegetable vendors in the area, making the location an ideal base to collect organic waste.
 
 BMC survey estimates that daily, about two tonnes of waste will be collected from residential colonies and three tonnes from vendors. A total of 800 MT of waste is generated in the city every day, with 60% being organic or disposable. This makes it an enriched resource for alternate energy generation.
