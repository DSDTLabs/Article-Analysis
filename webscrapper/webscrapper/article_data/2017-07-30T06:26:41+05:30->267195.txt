KOLKATA: A cell to monitor big-ticket industrial, infrastructural and social sector projects is set to become a reality as the state government issued an order on Friday appointing Rajarshi Mitra as joint secretary to head the cell. He will be briefed by chief secretary Malay De, to whom the cell will directly report to. The basic reason behind floating such cell is to ensure that no project is held up. “The terms of reference of this cell would include social projects like Kanyashree,” a top official added.

 The project monitoring cell will be a significant step towards achieving a single-window clearance that has been in the works for over a decade. Former industry minister Nirupam Sen in the erstwhile   government and Amit Mitra in the Mamata Banerjee government had repeatedly assured industrialists and investors of a fast-track, single-window clearance of major projects but it was never implemented.
 
 Towards the fag end of the Bhattacharjee government, the WBIDC had set up the state investment facilitation centre christened Shilpabandhu. However, it failed to deliver. The project monitoring cell for social sector is a pioneering initiative, feel industrialists.
