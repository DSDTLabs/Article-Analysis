Surat: Several   gathered at   near Surat district collectorate to demand relaxation in rules for them here on Thursday. The drivers arrived in their vehicles near the entry gate of Sarvajanik Education Society’s campus and parked them at the location which created traffic congestion. Police dispersed them and they could not make any representation as senior officials at the district collectorate were not present.

 The drivers want relaxation in rules framed by   which the police plan to enforce strictly from April 5. Wearing of the badge has been made compulsory for an auto-rickshaw driver. Only people who have a driving licence are eligible to get this badge. One needs to have passed class IX to get the driving licence. Majority of auto-rickshaw drivers don’t have the required qualification to get the driving licence and they drive without badge in the city. This is the reason for them to demand that auto-rickshaw drivers should not be penalized heavily for not wearing the badge, sources said.
