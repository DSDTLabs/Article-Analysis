Udhagamandalam: A Bengaluru-based wildlife activist has written to the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) accusing the field director of   (MTR) of allowing night safaris and granting illegal permits to do   to his relatives and friends. However, the field director,  , refuted the charges.

 In his letter to the ministry, wildlife activist and former member of   Joseph Hoover said he has been receiving information that Reddy was taking his friends to the core areas of the reserve for photography expeditions. “Reddy has also been giving research permits to his friends and relatives, who have no credentials or ability, to take up such works in the tiger reserve,” he alleged.
 
 When contacted, Reddy told TOI, “The accusations are utterly false. There are no night safaris in the reserve. It was being monitored round the clock.” 
 
 He also dismissed the allegation of granting illegal permits to his friends and relatives. “I have no authority in granting permission for conducting research in the reserve. Only the chief wildlife warden has the power to give permission for the purpose,” he added. The complaint is totally false and misguiding, Reddy said.
 
 Hoover had sent a copy of the letter to Global Tiger Forum, which monitor the wildlife in Asia. He said the   had acknowledged the letter while the MoEF is yet to respond.
