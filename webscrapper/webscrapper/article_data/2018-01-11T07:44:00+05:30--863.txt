Chandigarh: After launching the Punjab farm debt waiver scheme in Mansa last week, the state government has cleared 1.15 lakh more cases for debt waiver amounting to Rs 580 crore. These loans will be disbursed to farmers across the state before January 31, 2018. With this, a total of 1.6 lakh small and marginal farmers will be covered with a loan amount of Rs 748 crore.

 The government has stated that certificates will be presented in public so that the farmers are not misled on any count by the opposition or certain kisan unions seeking to promote their vested interests through false propaganda.
 
 The decision was taken on Wednesday at a meeting by chief minister Amarinder Singh to review the progress of the implementation of the farm debt waiver scheme, formally launched by the state government on January 7 with the disbursement of waiver certificates to nearly 47,000 farmers from five districts.
 
 In first phase, a total of 3, 20,395 cases of beneficiaries have been selected under the scheme and Sangrur district tops the list with 34,409 cases whereas 772 cases were reported from Pathankot district.
 
 Initially, the government is waiving off loans taken from cooperative institutions, for which a total of 5.63 lakh have been identified for relief to the tune of Rs 2,700 crore. The entire process would be completed in four phases, with commercial, private and nationalized banks to be covered after the cooperative institutions. The officials concerned were asked to ensure that the disbursement process is handled smoothly and no eligible farmer is left out.
