KALYAN: A 57-year-old Kalyan resident was murdered by his sons and a daughter-in-law allegedly for blowing up Rs 15 lakh on   and airing his plans to sell their family home to continue paying for his addiction.

 The accused have been identified as Kartik Konar (27), his wife Rajashree (25) and brother Vyanktesh (25). Police said the two brothers worked as vegetable sellers and their father, Marimuthu Konar, was employed as a driver with a private office.
 
 In their statement, the accused told Kolsewadi police that they were upset with their father over his plan to sell their 400-square-foot tenement in Vikas Society in Ekveera Nagar, Kalyan (E), after losing all his savings worth Rs 15 lakh in a span of two years. Marimuthu would spend at least Rs 2,000 a day on online lotteries.
 
 Police said the family routinely argued over the issue. Vyankatesh, who is a bachelor, often pleaded with him to not sell their home saying he would not find a bride.
 
 On Wednesday night, Marimuthu quarrelled with Rajashree and assaulted her when both his sons were not home. On Thursday, when they learned of the violence, the brothers and Rajashree first hit Marimuthu and then stabbed him to death. Neighbours who heard screams called up the local Kolsewadi police. 
 
 When cops rushed to their residence, the trio told them that Marimuthu had injured himself after falling off the stairs.
 
 He was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival.
 
 Sanju John, Kolsewadi police inspector, said, “The accused tried to evade arrest but we found stab injuries. We grilled Vyanktesh and Rajashree and they confessed to the crime.” John said, “After their confessions, we arrested both of them and our team also managed to nab Kartik who had fled from the hospital.” On Friday, the cops produced the accused before the Kalyan session court, which remanded them in police custody for five days.
