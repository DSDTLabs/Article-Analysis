CHANDIGARH: The   State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Thursday directed all district child rights protection officers for strict compliance of the Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, so that the inhuman act of begging could be eradicated from the state.

 To dissuade children from begging and to rehabilitate them, the commission has advised all district child rights protection officers to rescue child beggars and produce them before child welfare committee for taking further action according to law.
 
  secretary   wrote a demi-official letter to all district child rights protection officers to ensure that their areas were free from child begging. He further said that Punjab had enacted the Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, that mandates that no begging shall take place in the state. Section 9 of the Act reads “whoever employs or causes any person to solicit or receive alms, or whoever having the custody, charge, care of child, connives at or encourages employment or causing of a child to solicit or receive alms or whoever uses another person as an exhibit for the purposes of begging, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years but which shall not be less than one year.”
 
 Pannu further added that another law enacted by the central government in 2015 the   Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, also mandates against child begging. He, however, stated that despite the stringent penal provisions in place, child begging was continuing unabated in the state.
