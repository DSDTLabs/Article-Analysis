Ghaziabad: A 31-year-old property dealer died in mysterious circumstances at his in-laws’ house in Krishna Nagar late on Thursday night. The victim,  , and had been living with his wife Parul at her parents’ Krishna Nagar house for the past three months.

 Vijay’s twin brother Ajay, a Railway Protection Force constable, has alleged that he was murdered by Parul’s family. 
 
 According to Ajay, his sister’s husband Sanjeev Kumar received a call from Parul’s mother   around 10.30 pm on Thursday saying   fell from the roof of their three-storey house and was subsequently admitted to a private hospital. By the time they reached there, doctors said Vijay was dead and had been shifted to the hospital’s mortuary. “We suspect foul play as Vijay’s body does not bear injuries that are generally seen after falling from a height,” Ajay said, adding that Parul had been threatening to get him killed if he did not listen to her demands. 
 
 On Friday, a complaint was filed for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
 
 Parul’s younger brother   denied the allegations and said Vijay fell while he was standing against the boundary wall of the roof.
