MUMBAI: Continuing its performance, ' ' has once again tasted success with 137 of its students clearing this year's JEE (Main) and qualifying for the JEE (Advanced), for admissions to IITs. 

 Rahmani 30, an initiative of senior cleric  , began providing free coaching to Muslim aspirants for studying at the prestigious IITs. "We began in 2008 and till 2017 we have sent 213 students to the IITs. This year's JEE (Main) results are very encouraging as our overall success rate, including Patna, Hyderabad and Aurangabad centres, is 75% while the Patna centre's result is 100% (23 out of 23 students)," said Fahad Rahmani, CEO of Rahmani Programme of Excellence, the umbrella initiative which runs free residential-cum-coaching programmes for JEE (Main), JEE (Advanced), NEET, chartered accountancy and law entrance exams.
 
 Rahmani 30, in association with Anjuman-I-Islam and with financial support of Memon Chamber of Commerce, carried coaching for two batches of JEE aspirants in Mumbai. But they had to close down the Mumbai facility at the Anjuman-I-Islam last year due to lack of finance. The centre was moved to Aurangabad. This year, 17 students from the Aurangabad centre have qualified for JEE (Advanced) exams. The Mumbai centre's closure has disappointed many in the city with activists saying Muslim philanthropists and businessmen must ensure that a centre in the city is opened. "Why can't the city's Muslims finance a programme which is giving such excellent results?" said activist Shadaab Patel.
