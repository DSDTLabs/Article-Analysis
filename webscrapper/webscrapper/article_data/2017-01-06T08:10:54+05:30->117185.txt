 Lashing out at Prime Minister   and Telangana chief minister  , protesters said a dual policy was being adopted by both governments when it comes to people's issues.
 
 Nagender said PM Modi had failed to fulfil his promises made to the na tion on November 8. “The demonetisation move was against the interests of the common people and it has only benefited the BJP men. We have suffered, our businesses are down and we do not know how we will survive,“ said an angry trader, Asif Sheikh.
 
 The Congress party warned that it will intensify its protest against the Modi government if it fails to withdraw the demonetisation move. “Prime Minister Modi has gone back on his words.
