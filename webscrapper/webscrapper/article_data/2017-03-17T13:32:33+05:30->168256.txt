SURAT: Now, people won’t have to run from pillar to post for getting refund from   if they have booked their tickets by a  . Ministry of railways has simplified the procedure under which the refund amount would be directly deposited in the account of the person who had booked the ticket.

 Rakesh Shah, a member in   ( ) from Gujarat, ministry of railways, had strongly represented to railway minister Suresh Prabhu the need to implement the offline process of refund for railway tickets booked using the   (POS) directly into the account of the cardholders in January. 
 
 In his letter to railway minister, Shah pointed out that the POS machines have been kept at the current ticket and passenger reservation centres (PRS). However, the passengers booking tickets using their debit and credit cards have been asked to fill up the ticket deposit receipt (TDR) form at the PRS at the time of ticket cancellation. 
 
 Once the form is filled, the passengers have to send the TDR form to the zonal headquarters by incurring extra cost and after a few days the money is credited into their account. The entire process takes around 25 days. 
 
 Pursuant to the letter submitted by Shah, the ministry of railways issued directions to all the general managers of zonal railways across the country to immediately start refund of the tickets booked through the POS into the account of the customers. 
 
 PSC member Shah said, “Over 10,000 POS machines have been installed at the PRS and current booking counters across the country. The decision of the ministry to deposit the refund directly into the account of the passengers, without filling up of the TDR form, has come as a major relief to people. Post-demonetization, most of the passengers have been booking tickets through their debit and credit cards. However, they were not happy with physical submission of the TDR form at the zonal headquarters for getting refund of their cancelled tickets.”
