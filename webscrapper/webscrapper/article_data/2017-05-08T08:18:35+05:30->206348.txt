HOWRAH: A 25-year-old escorting his   home from tuition was   for trying to stop a local from harassing her in   on Saturday night. The victim is now battling for life at Uluberia State General Hospital. 

 Around 9.30pm on Saturday, the brother-sister duo were stopped by Imadul Mallik (23), who allegedly threatened to rape the Class-XI student in front of her brother. Mallik had allegedly been tormenting the girl for some time by sending her lewd text messages and stalking her. On Saturday, when her brother warned Mallik that he would lodge a police complaint against him, the accused stabbed him.
 
  Locals rushed in to help when the girl cried out and Mallik fled the spot.
 
 "We have launched a hunt to arrest the accused. He has been booked under several sections of IPC, which include attempt to murder and molestaion," said inspector in charge of Uluberia police station Subhrojyoti Majumdar.
