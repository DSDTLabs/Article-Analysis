MYSURU: Former chief minister and leader of the opposition   on Saturday said the   in its effort to get the ban on kambala lifted, even as he questioned the wisdom of banning rural sports like jallikattu and kambala.

 Shettar said   legislators will support the proposed ordinance and they’ll help the government to get it passed in both Houses.
 
 At the   in Suttur near here, he said the courts don’t intervene to stop slaughter of cows but have stepped in to ban jallikattu and kambala which go back centuries. Jallikattu and kambala are rural sports which also have a religious significance. They should not be banned as they don’t pose any threat. Youths participate in these sports which put their physical strength to test. Banning kambala is curtailing people from observing religious practices, he said.
 
 He questioned the NGOs on their silence about cow slaughter and said they moved courts to stop cruelty to animals. The courts should factor in religious sentiments attached to rural sports, he said, adding that they would die if they were banned.
 
 He said the government should create awareness about superstition but ban religious practices. Awareness is the key, he said.
