I signed   much before I started shooting for  ,” says  , who is clearly excited that the film, which was supposed to be his debut, is finally hitting the screens. Produced by   and  , under Legend Cinema, and presented by RB Choudary under Super Good Films banner, Dwaraka is releasing tomorrow. 
“I play Erra Seenu, a street-smart thug who pulls off petty robberies to get by. But one day, as he is on the run after a burglary, he lands up at an apartment named Dwaraka, where people mistake him for a baba. how he goes on to become a ‘dhongi baba’ because of situations is the crux of the story,” says Vijay, who is pretty kicked about unleashing his comic side in Dwaraka, directed by Srinivas Ravindra. 
 “The screenplay is such that it lends itself to a lot of situational comedy. The 150-flat apartment where the story is set has all sorts of people living in it — a lawyer, a wannabe MLA, an atheist and a bunch of bhakts. So, the residents set up an ashram in the penthouse of the building for me. And this gives way to a series of comic episodes,” says Vijay, adding, “actor   has an interesting role that is sure to get the audience cracking up. he plays a guy who talks philosophical stuff all the time in a serious manner, but he simply ends up being unintentionally funny. I can assure you it will be a total paisa vasool film!”
 So does the dhongi baba get to romance as well? “Of course! the love story between me and   is an important track in the film,” Vijay says, signing off.
