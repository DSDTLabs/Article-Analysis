Despite making an impression with his debut album Engaeyum Eppothum, C   has been working on only few films, and the composer says that it was because he chose to be selective about his projects. “Unlike most music directors, I do not delegate work and do most of the work myself, from programming to mixing. This process takes time, but now, I have found a workaround for this,” explains Sathya, who is now composing for three films, including Vikram Prabhu’s Pakka.

 “Pakka, which is directed by debutant SS Surya, has  , Nikki Galrani and Soori. It happens against a village thiruvizha backdrop, so the music will be folksy,” says Sathya. He adds, “For one song, I have composed a pure Karagattam song. I went to a village and stayed with real-life   players for a couple of days to understand their music.”
 
 He is also working on Theedhum Nandrum, which, he informs, revolves around friendship and robbery. “The director,  , was a winner in one of the seasons of Naalaya Iyakkunar. You can rest assured that this film will be quite unique,” says Sathya. There is also an untitled film directed by Prabu Solomon’s co-director Ezhumalai. “This is again a village story, where a temple is the subject of conflict,” he says.
