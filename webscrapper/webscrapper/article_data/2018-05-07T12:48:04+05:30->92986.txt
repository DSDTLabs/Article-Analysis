Jyotika, who is currently shooting for Mani Ratnam's 'Chekka Chivantha Vaanam' and will commence shooting for Radha Mohan's remake of Tumhari Sulu, 'Kaatrin Mozhi', next, is reported to have signed her next project. The film is said to be the remake of recently released   film 'Mohanlal' starring Manju Warrier. The film deals with celebrity worship syndrome in a humourous way.

 While the Malayalam version had the heroine playing an ardent fan of Mohanlal, the Tamil version, tentatively titled ' ', will have   playing a fan of Superstar Rajnikanth, with whom she acted alongside in P Vasu's 'Chandramukhi'.
 
 Suneesh Varanad, the writer of the film, had shared this development on his Facebook page. However, he has now deleted the post. When we got in touch with the director of Mohanlal, Sajid Yahiya, he clarified that the team had only planned to invite Jyotika and screen the film to her, to see if she would be willing to star in a possible Tamil remake. However, he added that there has been no development on that front so far.
