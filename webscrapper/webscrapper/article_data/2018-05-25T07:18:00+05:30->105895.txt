NOIDA: Two   were rescued from their abductors on Wednesday night near the   metro station. 

 The alleged abductors fled away after spotting the police team. The girls were identified as Shila (14) and   (15), residents of Ballia.
 
 Dial 100 Noida in-charge, Hom Singh Yadav said that on Wednesday at 11.12pm, police received a call from a passerby, Joginder Singh, informing that two men were trying to abduct two minor girls in a car. The caller informed that the girls were resisting the abduction bid and the police should reach the spot soon. 
 
 A police team on PRV No–1847 immediately rushed to the location. PRV commander   said that the accused persons fled in the car leaving the minor girls on the spot. 
 
 The girls were brought to the police station where they were counselled. 
 
 The girls said that on Tuesday someone had offered them ‘prasad’ at their native village. “As soon as we ate the Prasad, we lost consciousness. We opened our eyes and we were in a car somewhere in Noida. The accused persons were not known to us so we raised an alarm suspecting they were trying to abduct us,” the girls said. The two girls are neighbours in their native place. The police contacted their family members who informed that they had filed a missing complaint in   police station in Ballia. The victims’ relative, who lived in Noida’s Bhangel village, reached the spot when they received information. The girls were handed over to their relatives after completing the legal procedure. 
 
 The investigations regarding the suspects who had brought the girls to Noida are underway. Singh said that it seems to be a case of abduction but the prompt police response foiled the bid.
