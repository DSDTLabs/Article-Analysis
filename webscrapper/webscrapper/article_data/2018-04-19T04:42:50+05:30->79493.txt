HYDERABAD: The deep divide within   came out in the open yet again on Wednesday as party general secretary   was not allowed to table the draft political resolution, one of the most important documents, at the party   which got under way here on Wednesday. 

 The resolution, cleared by the   in January, was instead presented by Yechury’s predecessor   in what was seen as an unusual break from the convention of the party general secretary tabling the draft resolution and throwing it open for debate and discussion. 
 
 Yechury, however, tabled the minority view on the political resolution, the one he had proposed and which was rejected at the January meet. The Central Committee also accepted 286 amendments to the draft political resolution, discussions on which will begin on Thursday. 
 
 The resolution, once adopted will spell out the Left party’s tactical political line, seen as critical in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The departure from norm, sources in the party said, was because two sets of draft political resolutions were moved. 
 
 “Since the general secretary did not agree with certain aspects of the majority draft it was considered appropriate that he should table the version he agreed with,” a source said. A report on pre-Congress amendments was also placed on Wednesday.
