Music composer   celebrated his birthday on Tuesday. In a short span of time, Santhosh Narayanan developed a niche following among music lovers and rightly so. After making his debut with ‘Attakathi’, Santhosh is currently one of the top musicians we have today.

 This time for his birthday, Santhosh met superstar Rajinikanth at his residence and sought his blessings. Taking it to Twitter, he said, “Had a great start to the day with wishes and blessings from our beloved #kaala @rajinikanth sir.”
 
 
  
 
 Interestingly, on the other hand, ‘Thalapathy’   decided to give a surprise for Narayanan on his birthday. The actor apparently gifted a cricket bat imprinted with the word: SaNa, a short form of Santhosh Narayanan. Vijay also signed the bat with the caption: “Happy Birthday Nanba.”
 
 Sharing the picture on Twitter, Santhosh Narayanan said, “Had a very special surprise from dear @actorvijay sir. So sweet and thoughtful of you sir to sign and wish me on this specially made bat. This one has become a special monument for me! Thank you Anna.” It’s worth mentioning that Vijay and Santhosh Narayanan have worked in the film ‘Bairavaa’, which is known for the popular number ‘Varlaam Va’.
 
 
 Meanwhile, Santhosh Narayanan awaits the release of ‘Kaala’, in which he has composed the songs. The album was unveiled recently and gotten mixed response from the audience.
