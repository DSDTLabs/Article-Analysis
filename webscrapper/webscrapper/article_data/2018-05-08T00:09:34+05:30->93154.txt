Chennai: In a reprieve to Udhavum Karangal, an organisation providing care to the poor, downtrodden, and mentally ill people, the Madras high   has temporarily deferred the eviction process initiated by Chennai Corporation against one of its buildings in Maduravoyal.

 A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice P Rajamanickam granted the relief on a plea moved by the organisation, represented by its founder secretary S Vidyaakar. According to the petitioner, the organisation purchased 72cents of land in Maduravoyal through a possession and enjoyment sale deed dated June 9, 1993.
 
  Thereafter, the organisation put up a building for running a psychiatric nursing home at the cost of Rs 75,50,000, in which mentally ill persons were housed since 1993. The government submitted that after 2015 floods, a conscious decision was taken to remove encroachments on banks of Coovum river.
