AHMEDABAD:   organisations of Gujarat on Saturday began a campaign by distributing   to conduct   (discussion over a cup of tea) to abolish   by 2047- when India will celebrate 100 years of freedom.

 The campaign against untouchability, ‘Abhhadchhet Mukt Abhiyan’ began from Nani Devati village in Sanand taluka of Ahmedabad district in which dalit rights leaders like Prakash Ambedkar of Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, and grandson of Dr B R Ambedkar, and Martin Macwan, founder of  , along with members of the community participated.
 
  Kirit Rathod, member of an NGO involved in the campaign, said that they started the campaign by distributing 3,000 saucers as conversation during tea is a social culture in Gujarat villages, and it can be used to raise voice against untouchability.
 
 “We have inscribed a message of untouchability-free India on the saucers, so that discussions about abolishing the practice take off,” he said.
 
 Speaking on their further plans to highlight the issue, Macwan said, “We will also give a memorandum to CM Vijay Rupani on August 4 in a sunpda (winnowing basket) because the sunpda has representation of dalits like vankars (weavers) and skinners.”
 
 Macwan said the organizations will also present a 125-feet-long tricolour flag, which is the biggest so far, to the CM to tell him that dalits are also the citizens of this country.
 
 Untouchability has been practised for over 3,000 years, so a time period of 30 years has been taken to abolish the menace said Macwan. “The distribution of the tea saucers is a symbolic gesture as people earlier gave Ram-Patar (a separate utensil for dalits) and we had urged the community to accept Bhim-Patar (values of Dr Ambedkar) and reject Ram-Patar,” Macwan said. “With distribution of the saucers, we will be reaching out to every dalit family in the state in next three months.”
