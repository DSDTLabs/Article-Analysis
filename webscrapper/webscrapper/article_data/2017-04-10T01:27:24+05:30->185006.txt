Lucknow: As the   of   in the city continued for the 16th consecutive day on Sunday, traders claimed they had collectively suffered loss of nearly Rs 40 crore in the fortnight. The sellers are on strike following crackdown on unlicensed   and meat shops and LMC’s alleged refusal to renew licences. They also said the strike will continue till their licenses are renewed.

 Over 400 buffaloes weighing around 160-kg each and over 2,000 goats weighing around 10-12-kg each were being slaughtered on daily basis to meet the demand for meat. The cost of   is Rs 200 per kg which added to loss of more than Rs 20 crore in 16 days, while   is Rs 500 per kg which means a loss of Rs 19.20 crore was incurred in 16 days.
 
 According to All India Jamiatul Quresh Association member Shafaeen Qureshi, around 1,000 suppliers, distributors, exporters and retailers are associated with the business. There are over 50,000 Qureshi families in Lucknow associated with this business and are facing a tough time. Many big and small restaurants of the city sell dishes of buffalo meat but they are now forced to either remain closed or to change their menu.
 
 General secretary of AIJQA, Lucknow, Shahabuddin said LMC has refused to renew the licences, hence the strike has continued while there is plan for a bigger strike.
 
 “There are seven members in my family and we were totally dependent on the meat business and since the closure of slaughterhouses, I haven't earned a single penny,” said Rasheed Qureshi.
 
 "There were four dealers from Banthara were associated with me, but now they are buying meat from Unnao. I lost my earning and partners too. I don't know what should I do, if government will not provide us our licenses", said Nadeem Qureshi.
