VADODARA: The   (VMC) on Wednesday conducted a razing drive within the campus of the Kashivishveshwar Mahadev temple on the busy Productivity Road area of the city. The dwellings and other structures that had come up inside the campus haphazardly were razed.

 VMC officials claimed that most of the residences inside the campus had come up without building permissions. Some others were in a dilapidated condition and could have proved dangerous for the residents there, officials said. 
 
 The structures razed by the   include 28 residences. Mayor Bharat Dangar said that those staying there had been given houses in the civic body’s housing projects for the economically weaker sections.
 
 The VMC is looking to beautify the campus of the temple that is amongst the nine Navnath Temples believed to be the protectors of the city. The civic body had earlier written to the district collector seeking possession of the land to develop it.
 
 Dangar said that the temple is around 150 years old. “The space around the temple was contested and was even dirty. People had been approaching us with requests asking us to develop it,” said Dangar.
 
 Dangar said that the civic body was looking at having a green space in the area along with facilities for children and senior citizens. 
 
 Around 55,000 sq foot land is available at the site for development. Dangar added that the temple along with others in the campus will be retained in their original form.
