LUCKNOW: The UP cabinet on Tuesday overturned the SP government decision to construct the   power plant in Allahabad by the state government. The cabinet instead decided that the project will be developed through competitive bidding. 

 The 1,320 MW power project was to be developed by the state-owned UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam. State energy minister and government spokesperson   said Karchana power plant was getting delayed due to high cost. According to the detailed project report of the state government, the project is expected to cost around Rs 10,500 crore. 
 
 "The state government has, therefore, decided to adhere to the Centre's policy of getting power plants constructed through competitive bidding," Sharma told reporters.
 
 The cabinet also decided to get the transmission substations constructed for   and Obra power plants through a tariff based competitive bidding. The state government plans to construct a 400 KV transmission substation each in   and Firozabad for evacuation of power from Jawaharpur power project.
