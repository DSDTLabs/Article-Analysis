NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday made it clear that it was neither monitoring the probe to trace missing   nor had it ordered a   on any of the suspects.

 A bench of Justices G S Sistani and Vinod Goel said it was the domain of the police to decide the manner in which investigation has to be carried out, after one of the students under scanner sought recall of the high court’s December 14 and December 22, 2016 orders.
 
 The court said if the student does not want to undergo the test, he can refuse it, terming as “strange” that there is no clue about Najeeb despite five months of his disappearance.
 
 “It is very strange. Five to six months have gone by since he disappeared. Something should have come out, even if something worse has happened, it should have come out by now,” the court said.
 
 Najeeb’s family however urged the court to intervene, saying they want another agency to investigate the disappearance as Delhi Police investigation has hit a dead end. The high court also pointed out that every missing person case is important. The court’s observation came during the hearing of an application by one of the nine students, who are suspects in the case.
