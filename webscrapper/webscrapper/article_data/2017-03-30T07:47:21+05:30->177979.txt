JAISALMER: The   (NWR) zone has added two  , taking the total of such zones in the country to five.

 Rail sections under Jodhpur rail division have been converted into green corridors. Trains plying in the Barmer-Munabao and   rail sections have been fitted with bio-toilets for the purpose.
 
 This is part of the campaign to turn NWR into an eco-friendly zone. The two new sections will ensure that garbage or feacal matter do not fall on the track.
 
 The zone has worked in association with the state govt for the project. The country now has five such green corridors, including these two.

 Till now, NWR has set up 1mw solar power projects and works are being carried out to install 2mw projects.
 
 A total five lakh trees have been planted and water recycling projects have been put up in many places.
 
 While one recycling unit has been set up at Jaipur, work on another plant is going on in the section. Apart from this, work on recycling plants in Ajmer and Bikaner is being carried out. In the near future, trains will start running on CNG and, at present, a demo rail run is on between Rewari and Rohtak.
