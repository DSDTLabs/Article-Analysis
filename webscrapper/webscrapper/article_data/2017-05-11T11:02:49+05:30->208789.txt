GREATER NOIDA: Mystery shrouds the death of a 27-year-old software engineer, whose mutilated body was found near railway tracks at   village, some 6km from his Bisrakh home, in Greater Noida on Monday. Rajeev  's body was crushed and his hands and head were severed, said police.Prima facie evidence suggests that Rajeev, who used to work with   in Bangalore, had flown into Delhi on Sunday evening and was on his way home to Bisrakh when the incident took place. Police have found a flight ticket (departure time 3.10pm, May 7) and boarding pass for a trip from Bangalore to Delhi in his pocket. However, the bereaved family claimed that they had talked to Rajeev, an MTech from IIT-Bombay , over phone the same evening, but did not know about his travel plan.

 No suicide note was found on the spot or the body.
 
 The deceased's younger brother Ajay said that Rajeev had called him around 7pm on Sunday . “We had a brief conversation. I told him that I would go to Patna in a few days,“ said Ajay , who is pursuing MTech from IIT-Patna. According to Ajay , Rajeev later contacted his father   Singh but could not talk to him. When later Sohanpal called Rajeev's number, it was found to be switched off. The family members could connect to Rajeev's number only on Monday when a police officer received the call and informed them about his death.
 
 Family members suspect it as a murder because Chapraulla village does not fall on the route from the Delhi airport to Bisrakh. “Moreover, there was no reason for my brother to commit suicide. We have filed a complaint with the police, demanding fair probe into the matter,“ said Ajay .
 
 SHO Badalpur police station Anand Dev Mishra said preliminary investigation revealed that the person came in front of a train and died. “The post-mortem report revealed anti-mortem injuries. The body has been handed over to the family members. We are investigating the matter,“ he said.
