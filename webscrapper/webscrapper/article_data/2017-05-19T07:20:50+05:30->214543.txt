PUNE: The   office is unhappy with the dismal number of   school children that have undergone the  . 

 It has reiterated that the May 25 deadline for these vehicles will not be changed and has told schools as well as RTO inspectors to speed up the process.
 
 “Until now, only 600   have undergone the fitness test. This isn’t a good figure considering the fact that the number of registered vehicles plying school students is 3,700. The RTO has already said that all help will be provided to schools in this connection. However, with just a week left, schools should act now,” an official said.
 
 Last month, the RTO had said that all vehicles registered with it and transporting schoolchildren — buses, vans and minibuses — should get tested for fitness by May 25 or else their registration will be cancelled.
 
 “Even before that, we communicated this to schools. So, the decision was not sudden. There were some concerns that as it was the summer vacation period, many drivers would have gone home leaving their vehicles here. However, we have facilitated many things for them. The RTO will not extend the deadline. The 37 RTO inspectors have also been told to pull their act together and ensure that they each conduct the fitness test for at least 100 school vehicles by May 25. The process is on presently,” the official said.
 
 The official said parents should understand that sending their children to school in autorickshaws, which are usually overloaded, is a risk. He said the RTO, on its part, creates awareness through campaigns and sometimes even catches the autos. “But, it is the schools and parents who need to come to their senses,” the official added.
