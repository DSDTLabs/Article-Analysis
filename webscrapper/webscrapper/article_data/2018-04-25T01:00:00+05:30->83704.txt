 On working with Saurbh Shukla, Vipin Sharma stated, “Saurabh is an excellent actor. I have known him since my days at National School of Drama. We’d even done a play together that I had directed. Sharing screen space with him is always exciting. Our rapport is such that we can easily use each other’s energy and the scenes crackle. That is exactly what we did in a scene where we have a face off.”
