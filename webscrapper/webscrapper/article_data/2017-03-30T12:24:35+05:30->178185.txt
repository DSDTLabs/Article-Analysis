MEERUT: The project to construct computerised driving track to make driving tests tougher and transparent is hanging fire for the last two years. The construction of the promising project was to be completed in 2015-16 financial year but the money had to be returned to the treasury last year. Incidentally, this year, too, the money will be returned to the treasury as no plot of land has been finalised.
 
  Initially, the   had planned to set up the driving track in the office premises itself, but later it was decided that a five acre land for the track will be seen elsewhere- where the licence office will also be shifted (at present it is in the RTO office premises) to avoid any anomalies in driving licences.
  
  As of now, the driving skills of the licence seekers are tested manually, but the process is set to get computerised soon after the driving track is constructed – in the shape of number eight – wherein the city residents will have to pass a driving test without any human intervention.
  
  Speaking with TOI, assistant regional transport officer ( )  , said, “We are still under progress to get the land in the name of the RTO. A plot of land in Modipuram has been approved but paper work still remains and hence the money will have to be surrendered again.”
  
  When TOI reported about the driving track first in March 2015, a land with an area of 1000 square metres was finalised in the RTO office itself, where two different tracks in the shape of number eight were to be made. But now, because a new plot of land is being searched, the project hangs fire.
  
  Interestingly, the budget was allocated for 2015-16 financial year and the construction of the driving tracks should have been completed in this financial year only. But as the plan stays pending, the money was returned to the treasury in the last financial year and has been suspended again in this financial year.
