LUDHIANA: The municipal corporation sealed five luxury car showrooms on GT Road on Thursday for not clearing their change in land use (CLU) dues. 

 The officials started the sealing drive around 8am to avoid any ruckus. 
 
 Zone C assistant town planner   said, “We had served notices on 11 showroom owners on February 2, asking them to pay the CLU charges. The fee is mandatory for any commercial activity. The final notice was issued on March 6, giving the defaulters another 24 hours. While six showroom owners, on Thursday, produced receipts of having cleared the CLU charges, the five others could not and so, their outlets were sealed.” 
 
 Later in the evening, the five showroom owners deposited CLU charges of Rs 2.5 crore through cheques at   office. The civic body will now open the seals on Friday morning.
