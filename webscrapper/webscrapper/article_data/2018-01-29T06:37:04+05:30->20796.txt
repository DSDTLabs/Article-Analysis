 Talking about his roots, Bhatt said that Ahmedabad is like an endless well from which you can draw inspiration. “It is a city full of artists and designers who make and remake something daily,” he said. His art works such as Abrakh engraving and videos shot in the city celebrate the city’s heritage.

 How does he see the space for Indian artists in the US? 
 
 “Our strength lies in the way we connect the past with the present, historic to ephemeral and in the way we use new technology,” he said. 
 
 “For me, it is all about confluence of culture and thought. The exhibition (of South Asian artists) talked about the impact of heritage, trauma, location and dislocation in emerging art,” Bhatt said.
