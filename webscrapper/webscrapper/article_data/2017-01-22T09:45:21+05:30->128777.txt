Vadodara: An   in a pond at   close to the city on Saturday morning.

 A police official from Makarpura police station said local residents had found the body floating in the pond. Police said the man had been stabbed at least 20 times on chest and throat with a knife by his assailant. 
 
 The police could not identify the deceased as they did not find any identity card in his pocket. “We found his wallet in the pocket but it did not have any of his identity cards,” said in-charge police inspector, Makarpura police station, D I Mahida. The police also found a pair of earphones from his pockets but there was no mobile phone along with it.
 
 The police called residents of neighbouring villages to identify the man but the locals said the man was not from their village. The police said the man’s body might have been thrown in the pond after he was killed at some other place. “Since the national highway is nearby, it could be a possibility that the man could have been murdered somewhere else and then the body brought here and thrown in the pond. But, right now our priority is to ascertain his identity and then find his family members,” Mahida said.
 
 The police sent the body to   for post-mortem. “After a detailed report of the post-mortem is received, the exact time of his murder will be known,” the police said.
