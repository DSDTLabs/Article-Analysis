G Sathiyan could not do much against his second round opponent and he failed to go past him.
 
 Since the singles draw had 128 players, it was a busy day for the Indians in both sections as they began their campaign as early as at 9 am. They had easy passages in the first two rounds but the third round posed problems.

 In doubles, too, Indians could not make much of an impression except in the women's section, when Manika Batra and Mouma Das progressed up to the quarters. Unfortunately for them, they ran into the Chinese pair of Zhe Yuling and Chen Meng and after waging a good fight lost 7, 11, 12-10, 11-8, 11-8. The men's pairs of Sharath and Sanil Shetty and Soumyajit Ghosh and Harmeet Desai bowed out in the pre-quarterfinals.
