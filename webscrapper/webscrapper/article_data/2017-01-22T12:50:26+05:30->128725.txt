PATNA: Bihar on Saturday created history as it formed a human chain involving over three crore people to pledge support to the   government’s crusade against alcoholism.
 
  “Now that we are in receipt of data from district, we find that more than 3.02 crore people came out on the streets to form the chain as against our earlier estimate of two crore people,” a beaming Nitish said, adding the event underlined the massive public support for prohibition.
  
  He hoped the spectacular human chain would impact life in other states. “Bihar has set an example for other state governments, which fear revenue fall due to prohibition. I am sure our example will force a rethink,” he said.
  
  The CM was accompanied by his deputy   and senior officials, including chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, DGP P K Thakur and principal secretary (education) R K Mahajan.
  
  The officials said the actual chain exceeded even the estimated length of 11,292km as it covered 11,415km. “So high was the people’s enthusiasm that the chain started taking shape several hours before the scheduled time of 12:15pm,” the CM said and added the awareness drive against prohibition would continue till Bihar Diwas on March 22.
  
  Nitish dedicated the exercise to Mahatma Gandhi. “We will celebrate the Mahatma’s Champaran satyagrah centenary year from April with more enthusiasm. Infrastructure development on a massive scale is already on in the Gandhi circuit,” he said.
