RANCHI: The   of   (SER) on Thursday submitted a list of 40 demands to the   for financial allocation in the   scheduled for February. 

 The division demanded funds to improve track security, to strengthen the signal system and to boost passenger amenities in the next financial year. The division also sought funds for construction of new railway stations, footover-bridges and road over bridges.
 
 Unlike previous years, the Union government will table a single Budget document in the Parliament next month. This will also have the 2017-18 Budget provisions for the railways.
 
 Speaking to media persons in Ranchi on Thursday, SER general manager SN Agarwal hinted that the zone has proposed a revision of schedules of many important trains that are originating from Ranchi, Hatia, Kharagpur, Chakradharpur, Adra and Tatanagar railway stations. "The railway board is expected to meet on pan-India railway timings on Friday," Agarwal said. Agarwal, however, did not disclose the proposals sent by the Ranchi division. 
 
 Agarwal also said that four out of eight of its ongoing projects are expected to be made operational this year. The Ranchi-Lohardaga-Tori railway line is expected to be operational by March.
 
 Agarwal, however, conceded that the SER was having a tough time in replacing the old Indian coach factory (ICF)-made coaches with new ones. "We cannot withdraw the old coaches until we have new ones as replacements. Though the Union railway minister did not announce any new trains in his two successive Budgets, most of the new coaches that are being manufactured are being allotted to the new trains that had been announced in earlier railway Budgets," Agarwal claimed. Chief minister Raghubar Das had on several occasions requested the railways to allot new coaches in trains originating from  .
