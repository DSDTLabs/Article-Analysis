 is the girl of the moment. The actress looked like a million bucks in her   attire at the People's Choice Awards 2017 and to top it off, she even walked away with the trophy for the Best Dramatic Actress (TV). That's not where it ends.
 
 
  
 The actress even mingled with her 'Baywatch' co-star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and his daughter Simone,   and   at the ceremony. When you have so many stars under the same roof, it sure makes for one epic picture. A delighted Priyanka immediately took to Instagram to post the picture. She captioned it, 'Beautiful evening with beautiful people! Congrats @therock@jlo @tomhanks on your amazing wins! Awesome to meet you @simonegjohnson you looked lovely! Thx for the tip😘👏🏽'#PCAs'. Picture perfect, isn't it?
