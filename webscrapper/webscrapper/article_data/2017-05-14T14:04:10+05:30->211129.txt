 He said the party has accumulated the money through shell companies. "Sixteen shell companies managed by AAP MLA   donated to Aam Aadmi Party," he alleged.
 
 "AAP did not inform about some of its fundings which it received from fake companies," he said.
 
 He alleged a huge discrepancy in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 between the amounts AAP has in the bank, what it declared to the EC and what it made public on its website.
