Six major stations in Southern Railway - Trichy, Madurai, Salem, Chennai Egmore, Kanyakumari and Palakkad - have been identified by the railway board for execution of development or redevelopment work. The work, which is estimated to cost between Rs 15 crore and 20 crore for each station, is expected to provide an enhanced and richer experience to the passengers.

 In a circular dated March 7, 2018, sent to all the general managers of zonal railways, the chairman of railway board   instructed that the entire work in all identified stations should be completed by December 2018.
 
 According to the circular, all divisional railway managers have been assigned to appoint an architectural consultant for preparation of the overall plan. The concerned divisional officials have also been asked to make visible changes in the stations without unnecessary construction. They may also take feedback and ideas from local stakeholders.
 
 The developmental work includes improvements of the facade of the station building and circulating areas to duly streamline the traffic flow. The circulating area should be redeveloped to provide well-regulated lanes for pick up or drop, private vehicles like car or two-wheelers, passengers and staff parking and exit lanes.
 
 Improvement of existing waiting halls, retiring rooms, toilet facilities, drinking water arrangements in waiting halls, potable water at all times across the platform length shall be provided, the circular said.
 
 Suitably located charging points for mobile phones, placing station map, indicating the available facilities (platform-wise) may be provided. It is also said that the divisional officials may also create their own jingle which can be played between the public announcements.
