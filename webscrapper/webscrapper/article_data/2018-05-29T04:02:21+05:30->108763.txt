BHOPAL: Jagannath   often met   Kewat in this far-flung Chhulkari village in MP’s Anuppur district. Their paths would cross almost every morning — one would go to work at South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), and the other to graze his cattle. For 34 years, the cattle grazer never had a clue that the man he and the entire village knew as   Kewat had stolen Jagannath’s identity and job in the mines. 

 
 Bheemsen enjoyed the status of a government employee, and was enjoying a government pension when truth caught up with him, thanks to   card and Bheemsen’s ancestral property. Bheemsen was arrested for fraud on May 26, 2018, and is now cooling his heels in jail. In the 1980s, a job card was the ticket to government employment for illiterates. 
 
 Jagannath had one, Bheemsen didn’t. When SECL started hiring labourers in 1982, Bheemsen took Jagannath’s job card and applied as Jagannath Kewat, say police. “When he retired in 2016, his last drawn salary was Rs 52,708 — quite a handsome amount in these parts. And the original Jagannath is living in poverty. Both of them are illiterate and only know how to sign,” Bhalumada police station ASI R K Shukla told TOI. 
 
 Bheemsen opened bank accounts, even made an Aadhar card in the name of Jagannath Kewat. But how was he caught? “He did not change the name in revenue records for his land as it would have meant that his ancestral property would not be transferred in his name. Similarly, in the Aadhar card of his son, he kept his original name otherwise the land wouldn’t pass to his next generation. This was the first clue that led us to more evidence,” Shukla said.
