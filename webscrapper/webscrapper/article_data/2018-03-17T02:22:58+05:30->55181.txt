NEW DELHI: There was high drama at ITO   station on Thursday evening when a   passenger, denied entry past the security check by  , called PCR and said he had been kidnapped, minutes after he was taken to the station control room due to his intoxicated state.

 The incident took place around 6:15pm when the commuter, Sandip (38), came to board a metro. CISF officials said the passenger was denied entry at the security check point as he was in no state to travel safely in the metro. However, the man started creating a ruckus and was taken to the station control room. Within minutes, the passenger allegedly dialled PCR and claimed that he had been kidnapped and was currently at Mandi House station.
 
 “The passenger was so drunk that he did not know what was happening. He called the police and said he had been kidnapped and that his current location was Mandi House. We immediately informed PCR that a call had been placed by this commuter,” a senior CISF official said.
 
 Officials said the passenger was kept at the station control room until the Delhi Metro Rail Police arrived on the scene.
 
 CISF officials said they had placed special focus on drunk passengers over the last few months with a protocol to not allow them to board trains.
 
  In the last three months alone, 38 drunk passengers were denied boarding by CISF, while in certain cases, they were even de-boarded for creating ruckus. A drunk female passenger was also denied entry on March 11. 
 
 However, CISF personnel took her in their vehicle and safely dropped her at Dhaula Kuan station where her husband was waiting.
 
 “We deny entry to passengers but we also drop them or book cabs for them if we feel it is not safe for them to travel alone,” the CISF official said.
