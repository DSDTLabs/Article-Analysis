Mumbai: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Thursday arrested four Customs agents who submitted fake invoices and claimed export incentives to the tune of Rs 10 crore. 

 The export incentive scheme called ‘drawback’ is a sop that the government gives exporters for bringing in foreign exchange. The accused had fraudulently shown that consignments of Rs 100 crore had been exported to the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, said a DRI officer. 
 
 The arrested include Sanjay Shinde (45), Uttam Chaudhry (46), Dharmesh Joshi (38) and Manoj Bhanushali (31). Hinting at a bigger racket, the DRI official said, “As evidence of export, the accused had submitted 250 bogus shipping invoices to claim the drawbacks. They also forged the documents of central excise officials. This fraud has caused a loss of Rs 10 crore to the state exchequer.” 
 
 A sum of Rs 44 lakh has been seized from the homes of the accused. 
 
 The accused who were produced in the Esplande court on Thursday were sent to judicial custody. “They were in touch with an exporter based in UP and used the firm’s letterhead,” added the official. The accused had shown export of incense sticks, perfumes, tea, coriander and cosmetics. 
 
  “We are also trying to establish if the UP firm had any clue about the export incentive racket,” added a source.
