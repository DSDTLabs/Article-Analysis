LUCKNOW:   functionaries have taken up the task to “hand-pick”   and   officers to ensure that the Aditya Nath Yogi government delivers on promises made by the   in its election manifesto. They are taking help of the state government’s vigilance department in their hunt for “honest, dynamic and workaholic” IAS and IPS officers.

 After the decisive mandate in the recent assembly polls in UP, the BJP’s focus is now on 2019 Lok Sabha elections. To achieve this goal, the Yogi government’s top priority is to deliver the promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra.
 
 According to an RSS insider, the preparation of the list of IAS and IPS officers is almost complete, and the names are being sent to the vigilance department for verification. Since the selection has to be made from a pool of existing officers, the RSS has decided to overlook their individual ideology.
 
 “Irrespective of whether he/she is pro-BJP/RSS or anti, we are considering only if the official is honest and hardworking,” a senior RSS pracharak told TOI on Sunday, adding that the government’s priority is to end mafia raj, corruption and deliver on the poll promises the BJP.
 
 Similar criteria would be followed for appointments in various boards, commissions and committees. Citing an example, another senior RSS functionary said that cane development minister Suresh Rana has removed 354 directors in 169 sugarcane committees across the state which act as bridge between farmers and the sugar mills in the state.
 
 Even after two weeks in government, Yogi has not made a large-scale official reshuffle as had been the case in previous governments.
