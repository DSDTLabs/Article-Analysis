Zirakpur: For visitors to locate a residential or commercial site at   is a struggle, as the municipal council has failed to put up any sign. The visitors have to depend on passers-by for directions. 

 During a visit to Dhakoli on Saturday, TOI found that a few residential societies had put up own signs on the main road to guide the visitors to these apartments. Thanks to technology, some of the commuters are lucky to have GPS (global positioning system). Or they ask shopkeepers.
 
  ( ) president   said the eight housing societies that his association represented had installed signboards at own expense instead of continuing to wait for the authorities to do the same. "The visitors use to lose direction and complain a lot about the difficulty in locating the addresses in Dhakoli. We did try to get a few boards installed but still a number of societies are still left out."
 
  of Gulmohar Trends society said the people of these apartments were also planning to pool in money for getting road sign installed, "since the MC took no action in this regard".
