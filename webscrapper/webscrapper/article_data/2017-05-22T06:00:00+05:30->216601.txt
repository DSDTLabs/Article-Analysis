Vijay Tendulkar’s story of ‘Kamala’ exposes the evils of flesh trade and the position of women in patriarchal hegemony. Breathing life into the play, Hyderabadi theatre group KissaGo staged the play on Saturday, which echoed the callous reality portrayed in Tendulkar’s play. 
The play brings to light how women are mere playthings in the hands of men, who disregard the feelings, sensibilities and will of a woman.   as innocent  ,   as the duty-bound Savitha who has no choice but to do her husband’s bidding and Jay Jha as male chauvinist   were commendable in executing the play and bringing out the dynamics of the characters.
