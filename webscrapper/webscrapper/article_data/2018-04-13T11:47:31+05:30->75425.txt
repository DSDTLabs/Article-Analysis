 Shania Twain said the 'silent evil thing',  , has affected her life.

  
  
 According to reports, 'Lyme disease does affect your life for sure. It's such a silent evil thing,' 
 
 "A lot of the symptoms you just learn to live with. I was lucky that I caught it early. I did get a lot of damage but I'm not battling with degenerative organ issues so I feel very fortunate."
 
 Last year, she had opened up about the diagnosis of Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection spread by infected ticks.
 
 On a daily basis, she stays focussed on staying in good health. She also has perspective in the fact that everyone is faced with challenges. 
 
 "By the time you are my age, you have something. Everybody's got something in some form of their life," she joked.
 
 "I'm proud of myself on one hand for persevering."
 
 Twain will hit the road next month in support of her latest album titled 'Now'. 
 
 As for her pre-show rituals, the   revealed that things have slightly changed after learning about her Lyme disease diagnosis.
 
 "It's more work for me now vocally because of the Lyme disease effect on the nerves in my larynges so it's like an hour and a half of like physical exercise," she said.
 
 'I take a mini trampoline with me and I've got to do a real pre-show show.'
