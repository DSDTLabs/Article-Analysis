Actor   said that when he was 15, he once glued wig hair to his crotch area to impress girls.

 Reportedly, the   star said that he was a "late developer" who "looked about 7". Therefore he desperately tried to look older at a party he attended after appearing in a play, in which he had a "black, very acrylic, highly flammable wig" glued to his face to make him look order.
 
  
  
 During his appearance on  , the actor said: "I might meet a girl and maybe she drops a hand, so I had the idea to maybe cut off some extra hair. So I went into the dressing room, I went into like the toilet, and cut off this like very curly jet black hair." 
 
 After sticking the wig to his crotch area with a glue, he stood "in front of the mirror going, 'That looks alright.' Just the length you go to". 
 
 When Mirren asked Dornan if the removal process was painful, he answered that it was a "physically and emotionally painful experience!"
