NEW DELHI: Almost a month after floating its latest housing  , Delhi Development Authority ( ) has received just over 5,000 applications for the  . Officials attribute this to several reasons, including real estate slump, demonetisation, banks not giving loan for earnest money, etc.

 The land-owning agency has sold close to 56,000 forms. “We have asked banks to give us the number of forms sold by Monday,” said  , principal commissioner, housing and land disposal, DDA.
 
 A majority of flats, mostly LIG/one-bedroom, put on sale are located in Rohini and Narela. Residents living in these areas have complained about lack of basic facilities, like water, road infrastructure, transportation, safety, etc.
 
 While DDA officials have assured to fix the problems before handing over the flats, they don’t ascribe these reasons for the poor public response. “Most people apply in the last few days. However, we can’t force banks to give loan for earnest money,” said Agarwal.
 
 Banks are not giving loans for earnest money because of the new penalty clause introduced by DDA. “If people don’t cancel on time, the banks will lose the money as applicants just pay them interest while applying for the scheme,” said a DDA official.
