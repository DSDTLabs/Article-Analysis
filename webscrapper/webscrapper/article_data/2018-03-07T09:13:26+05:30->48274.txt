HYDERABAD: Former chief minister of Jharkhand   said that the   ( ) had not taken any decision as yet on joining the federal front proposed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. 

 Speaking to TOI over telephone, the JMM leader said that forming a third front was not something that a single person can take. "All political parties have to be consulted," he said. Soren said that in such a case, it may be necessary to consider the views of UPA partners too. 
 
 "If the   is being brought into the picture again, KCR's plans can go awry. What KCR is planning is a non-Congress and non-BJP coalition," he said. Hemant Soren said that JMM leaders will discuss the idea that KCR has come up with and that it will not be done in a hurry. 
 
 Earlier during the day, Soren who met Congress president   Gandhi, said Rahul had assured support for the JMM in the next elections. In that context, the JMM may not be too inclined to KCR's idea of forming a federal front, minus the Congress.
