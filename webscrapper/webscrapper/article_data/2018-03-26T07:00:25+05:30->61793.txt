PANAJI:Teachers of government-aided schools across Goa are disappointed. Even as another financial year-end approaches, their   arrears, since the implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, are nowhere in sight. 

 The salaries of teachers were hiked, as per the recommendations of the seventh pay commission, from January 1, 2016. Teachers of government schools were paid the new salaries from January 1, 2017 and were also also paid arrears for the 12-month period of January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2017.
 
 “However, for government-aided schools, the government has to carry out pay fixation for each individual school. This took time and the seventh pay commission salaries came into effect for aided schools from early to mid-2017 onwards. None of the government-aided school staff have been paid their arrears since January 1, 2016 till the time their new salaries came into effect in 2017,” said one teacher.
 
 Teachers said that around 10,000 teachers, headmasters, lab assistants, poens and clerks of aided school are affected by the non-payment of arrears.
 
 “We were told we would be paid the arrears by the end of the last financial year, March 31, 2017. Now we are approaching the end of another financial year but there is no sign yet of the arrears. The more the arrears keep mounting, the more we stand to lose as a lumpsum tax payment. Why are government-aided school staff being given stepmotherly treatment? Our seventh pay salaries were also implemented later as compared to government school staffers,” said another Panaji-based teacher.
