Vadodara: Vihang Trivedi, who is into construction business, was booked on Tuesday at Manjalpur police station for not paying Rs six lakh to Kanhaiyalal Mavi, a civil contractor who built toilets in Desar in Savli taluka.

 In November 2016, Trivedi approached Mavi for building toilets saying that he had got contracts under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. He was asked to get labours and the wages were also fixed. 
 
 Three months later, when the work ended, Mavi was paid Rs five lakh out of the promised Rs 14 lakh. Mavi kept asking for remaining amount which the accused kept dilly dallying. Later, Trivedi gave two cheques of Rs 50,000 to Mavi’s men which, on depositing, returned. In April last year, when Mavi went to Trivedi’s office for money, the latter abused him and threatened him of dire consequences.
 
 Several months later, the duo reached a settlement and signed an agreement according to which Trivedi agreed to pay Mavi Rs 5.75 lakh by January 15 this year. On the said date, when Mavi called Trivedi for payment, he postponed the date to January 28 which again he delayed and eventually did not pay. Tired of Trivedi’s false promises, Mavi finally registered an FIR against him on Tuesday.
