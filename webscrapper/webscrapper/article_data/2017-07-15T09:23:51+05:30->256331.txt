HYDERABAD: Justice A Rajasheker Reddy of the   on Friday issued contempt notices to  's higher education principal secretary Nilam Sawhney and its commissioner for collegiate education K Sunitha and directed them to appear before the court to explain as to why they failed to implement an order of the court pertaining to the absorption of a   in an aided post. 

 The judge was dealing with a contempt plea filed by Dr Darsi Phebe Sarah who has been working with  , Guntur, as botany lecturer. When an opportunity came to absorb her in an aided post, the authorities had refused to do so. Then she filed a writ petition in the HC which directed the state and the college in October 2013 itself asking them to absorb her. In fact, the court directed the state to accord permission to the college to absorb Sarah with retrospective effect from February 2001.
 
 Appearing for Sarah, senior counsel P Gangaiah Naidu told the court that though three years had elapsed since this order, it was not implemented. AP has initially referred to some pending matters before Supreme Court for the non implementation. Even that ground later disappeared because the apex court too ruled in her favour. 
 
 On Friday, the state counsel informed the court that the matter was referred to a sub committee and that they will decide soon. The senior counsel objected to this and described this as yet another delay tactic. The court too found fault with the attitude of the state machinery and issued them statutory notices asking them to appear before the court. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Gangaiah Naidu said that the state should take the legal victories registered by ordinary people with great respect and should strive to implement them. The case will come up again after four weeks.
