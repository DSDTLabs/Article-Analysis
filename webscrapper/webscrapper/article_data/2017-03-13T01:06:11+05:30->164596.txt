Lucknow: The number of voters who pressed the None of the Above (NOTA)   of the electronic voting machine in the Uttar Pradesh assembly   this time was unprecedented and an indicator of the lack of faith in and anger they had against the political parties and their candidates. In 12 constituencies of the state, 7,57,643 votes were polled as   accounting about 0.9 percent of total votes polled. In each of these constituencies, NOTA was bigger than the   of victory. The option has been used more by the rural constituencies.

 Additional CEO Election Commission P K Pandey said, “We have not yet reviewed the figures yet but it is true that more rural constituencies have voted in NOTA, presumably because of lack of development in their villages. NOTA has not yet emerged as a decisive force since its inception in 2014.”
 
 In the Assembly constituency of Domariyaganj, the victory margin is only of 171 votes, while NOTA in this constituency was polled 1,611 times.
