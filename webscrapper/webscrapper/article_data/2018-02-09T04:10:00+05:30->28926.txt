Vadodara: In an attempt to handle the possibility of water shortage in the city, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will be drilling 15 tube wells in different parts of the city. While the other sources of water may not dry up, the VMC is concerned about the fate of Narmada water it lifts through a Sardar Sarovar project canal in Khanpur.

 The civic body draws 75 million litres per day (MLD) water from the Narmada canal. Officials said that this does not form a major portion of the water supply to the city that needs around 500MLD water per day.
 
 VMC commissioner Vinod Rao said that the tendering process for the bore wells will begin soon. The work is expected to be completed within a month and will contributed 15MLD water to the city’s water supply system.
 
 Rao said that the civic body has spare pumping capacity at its Raika French well in the Mahi river. 
 
 “We can use this capacity to draw additional 15MLD water. With 30MLD supply from the bore wells and Raika, the shortage will not be acute. We will regulate supply in other areas to take care of the shortfall,” he said. Rao pointed out that the situation was not grim for now, but the VMC was preparing itself for any eventuality.
 
 The Ajwa Sarovar that is one of the major sources had sufficient water for now. 
 
 If the water level in the reservoir went below 203 feet above sea level after Ju8ne 15, the VMC will have to install pumps to draw water from it. Till then water will be available through gravitational force from the reservoir. The level of the reservoir presently is at 209.3feet against 211feet last year.
 
 Mahi water to be diverted to other areas
 
 Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is concerned over water from Mahisagar river being diverted to other areas through a Narmada canal. Officials said that a project in this regard was in the pipeline. If this happens, supply of water to the city from the river may be affected.
