 According to Naisy, her father Mathew Kaalayil had joined a chit fund scheme of KSFE, Thalayolaparambu branch. In 2007, he had taken a loan of Rs 15 lakh by pawning his house and property. However, Mathew went missing in November, 2008. 
 
 In December last year, the remains of his body were unearthed from under the foundation of a newly constructed 3-storey shopping complex in Thalayolaparambu. The murder mystery unfurled after Naisy recorded a phone conversation between her and father of the accused and presented it to the police.
 
 Naisy said the amount to be repaid has now risen to Rs 30 lakh including interest. "I came to know that once the KSFE gets the formal confirmation that my father is dead, they will start the procedure for attaching the property," she said. The family owns 36 cents of land with two houses, one of them old and in a wretched condition. The Rs 1,000 rental income from the older house helps her run the family.
 
 Naisy had been taking care of the family since 2008 but lost her job as a home nurse during the course of murder investigation. Naisy who got married ten months before her father went missing also went through a broken marriage. Two members of her family - mother and one sister - are suffering from ailments. While working with the nursing agency, June last year, she had donated her kidney to the husband of her friend. She did it so because it was her wish to do something in the 'Year of Mercy.'
 
 "I am living like a beggar now on the mercy of my friends," she said. Now, Naisy is planning to meet finance minister   and the chief minister to seek their help.
