NAGPUR: Yet another case of   ( ) neglecting unauthorized commercial buildings has come to fore. Documents obtained under the Right To Information (RTI) Act have revealed that two floors of Chaudhari Lifestyle building on Ring Road near Pratap Nagar square are unauthorized. The building has been brought into total commercial use over a year ago but no action has been taken by the civic body.

 Within a span of 16 days, fire incidents were recorded in four commercial buildings in Giripeth, Dharampeth, Sadar and Kalamna, the latest one being on Monday. All four structures had unauthorized constructions and also lacked fire safety systems and lacked sanctions.
 
 RTI activist TH Naidu obtained documents including sanctioned building plan of Chaudhari Lifestyle building on Plot 69 in Atre layout. Documents show use on the land is residential in city’s development plan (DP). NMC had sanctioned the building plan for residential-cum-commercial on December 31, 2014.
 
 The sanction is for parking in basement, one shop along with letter box and AC plant room on ground floor. First and second floors were supposed to be totally residential. Of the total plot area of 543 sq mtrs, 60% (353.29 sq mtrs) is meant for residential, 17.65 sq mtrs for commercial and remaining for balconies etc.
 
 Owner of the building Rahul Chaudhari constructed the total building for commercial use. Two floors sanctioned for residential are being utilized for commercial purpose making it a completely unauthorized structure.
 
 TOI, on January 6, had highlighted that building lacked   from the NMC’s fire and emergency services department too. As per NMC’s norms, NOC from fire department is must for commercial building/area of 150 sq mtrs or more and any building with a height of 15 metres or more.
 
 Stating the building also lacked occupancy certificate, Naidu alleged NMC officials were hand-in-glove with Chaudhari. “They showed commercial area within limit and also kept the building’s height at 14.90 metres, just 10 cm below maximum mark.
 
 “NMC officials are aware of unauthorized constructions and usage as it is totally residential plot. Still, no action has been taken. It is the responsibility of NMC to inspect buildings during and after construction and check for deviations from sanctioned plan but it was never done. After complaints from citizens, only notices are issued. The building is in use for storing and selling garments and prone to fire. Still, the building lacks all mandatory permissions,” he said.
 
 NMC deputy engineer (Laxmi Nagar Zone) RV Mule told TOI a special drive will be taken to inspect all buildings on Ring Road between Khamla square and Pratap Nagar square soon. “There are many complaints related to the buildings in this stretch. Appropriate action will be taken on violations,” he said.
 
 One of the owners   said they were paying property tax for commercial, so it was not a loss to the NMC. “Market areas like Sitabuldi, Dharampeth etc are lacking parking spaces and facing congestion. There is need to develop more commercial areas in other parts of the city. Commercial plots are not situated and should be provided,” he said. Chaudhari added process to obtain fire NOC was underway. “Process to install all systems is going on,” he added.
