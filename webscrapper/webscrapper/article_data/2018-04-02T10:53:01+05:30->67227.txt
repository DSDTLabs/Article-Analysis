HYDERABAD: The state government may have claimed that one of its main aims is to provide free KG to PG education in  , but none of the   in the state offer kindergarten admissions yet.

 “One reason why we get few admissions in government schools is because we lack pre-primary section. When we door-to-door to increase enrolment, we notice that there are many children who are between 3-4 years,” said   E, a government teacher, adding it is hard to attract a student to a government school after they studied kindergarten at aprivate one.
 
 Teachers further said it made no sense to have different rules for government and private schools. “If a private school can admit a child who is three years old, why can’t the government ones too do the same? If this is made possible, students will get used to school environment by class 1 and will learn better. Also, the state can’t claim they are providing free KG to PG education by establishing few model schools which have classes from class 6 to class 12,”   M, a teacher.
 
 Education department Officials say pre-primary is covered under Anganwadis. But, as the main responsibility of Anganwadi workers is to administer immunisation and supervise distribution of supplementary nutrition to kids below six, teachers said these centres are not useful, unless brought under education department. “If pre-primary classes are started, the state has to take care of this in the budget. Now, Anganwadis, under women and child welfare department, get funds from Centre,” said an official.
 
 TIMES VIEW: The government must start pre-primary classes and also begin kindergarten classes to ease kids into the education system or else plans to provide education for all, will remain a distant dream.
