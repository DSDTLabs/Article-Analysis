LUCKNOW: Protesting against the  , employees of the   disconnected supply to several government offices and residences in the city on Saturday at 11am over non-payment of dues.

 The state revenue department is the biggest defaulter with Rs 12 crore of dues. Lesa chief engineer AK Singh said the disconnection to government departments was a part of employee agitation. While about 500 homes plunged into darkness in  , where Rs 6 crore are due, several government guest houses were left dependent on generators.
 
 
 The affected buildings were Dalibagh VIP guest house (Rs 3 crore),   (Rs 2 crore), VVIP guest house (Rs 2 crore),   (Rs 1 crore), state guest house, Vikramaditya Marg (58 lakh), state guest house,   (Rs 9 lakh) and new MLA colony (Rs 11 lakh). Dubey said the power secretary had asked him to reconnect the supply but protest of employees overruled the secretary’s orders. He added that over Rs 10,000 crore was due by UP government through its departments statewide.
 
 “We always take the government departments for granted, but as part of the agitation against the government’s move, the snap to government offices will be continued. We will observe a boycott on March 27,” said Singh.
