NOIDA: The two cities in the national capital region— Ghaziabad and Noida— apart from Lucknow, are extremely unsafe and accounted for maximum fatalities in road mishaps in   in the past one year, a data compiled by the state police show. The data—collected by police to curb road accidents in the state—further reveal that last year, the highest number of road accidents occurred in   and Sahibabad in Ghaziabad and in Sector 20, Noida.

 While the figures of fatalities are still being collected, it show that the highest number of accidents took place in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and   districts, in that order.
 
 Traditionally, Kanpur has remained the most vulnerable for road users in UP. The department is now contemplating to rope in experts to improve road design features at the identified blackspots in NCR.
 
 Director of transport at World Resources Institute, India, Amit   said, “Vehicle population is increasing at an alarming rate in Delhi and NCR. Most urban planning is focused on high-speed commute. While four-wheelers do benefit, a lot of times, two-wheeler riders or cyclists and pedestrians are at the receiving end since their safety is largely overlooked.”
 
 While majority of accidents in Lucknow took place on outskirts, most SOS calls in Noida originated from Sector 20 police station area. In Ghaziabad, Indirapuram and Sahibabad accounted for most accidents.
 
 Bhatt stressed that accidents occur frequently at places like Noida Bypass, which connects Noida City Centre with Dadri, as motorists start speeding up.
 
 ADG (law and order)   said, “We are compiling road accident and casualty figures and would share our findings with concerned departments. Experts would be roped in to give recommendations to government.”
 
 In Noida, traffic inspector Layak Singh said that the maximum number of accidents are reported from the expressway area and hence, the data was a little surprising and had to be analysed.
