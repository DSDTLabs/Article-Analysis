Ponda: A field visit by the Ponda block development officer (BDO) to   on Wednesday afternoon revealed that 60 unauthorized structures, including 25 commercial units, were rented out without any basic facilities. Some rooms were rented out to migrant labourers who were defecating in the open.

 A circular issued by the secretary of panchayats directed BDOs of all talukas to conduct field visits of the panchayats within their jurisdiction. In compliance with the notification, Ponda BDO Prasiddha Naik, visited Kavlem and inspected several areas, including some premises at Dhavli. 
 
 After his inspection, Naik told reporters that he found 60 unauthorized structures, comprising small rooms, rented out to labourers. The rooms did not have any toilet facilities forcing the families living within them to defecate in the open.
 
 The BDO also found that several commercial structures, including a furniture shop and fabrication unit, had been dumping hazardous waste items in the scrapyards nearby.
 
 Sarpanch Rajesh Kawlekar said the owners of the scrapyards were issued no objection certificates (NOC) by the earlier panchayat body, but no rented rooms had been given permission to operate since the last five years. “The panchayat will initiate stringent action against the unauthorised constructions,” Kawlekar said.
 
 Naik said he has given the Kavlem panchayat an ultimatum of 30 days to initiate appropriate action or face necessary action under the Goa Panchayati Raj Act.
