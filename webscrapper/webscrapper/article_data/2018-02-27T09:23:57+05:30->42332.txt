 : Zirakpur may have the VIP Road, but most streets in this satellite town turn pitch dark after sundown.

 
 A majority of streetlights on VIP Road, and in Gazipur and Dhakoli, are non-operartional, revealed check by The Times of India on Monday. That’s not all. The town’s municipal council has not gotten the lights repaired, in spite of several complaints made by residents.
 
 The next to non-existent lighting has made many areas in this town inaccessible for senior citizens and women.  , a resident of Gazipur, said streetlights on the   and the Gazipur Link Road were not functional. “A drive back home through this stretch, especially after work, keeps women on the edge,” she said.
 
 She said a liquor shop was located where Gazipur Link Road met Old Ambala Road, and that turned a simple drive into an ordeal. “Eve teasing and stalking happen every day on this road. In my last two years here, I have never seen police patrolling the area,” she said.
 
 Another resident, Amit Sharma of Gazipur, said lighting was inadequate on the road behind the hotel Best Western Maryland. “People face great difficulty at night as the roads are full of potholes. Some street lights are so dim that one can only see the poles,” he said.
 
 Abhijit Bose, a resident of Zirakpur, said streetlights on the   had been non-functional for more than a year. “The lights have not been working ever since the road was widened. Accidents are regular on this stretch. The increase in traffic on this roaded has added to the risk,”   added.
 
 Navjit Singh Miglani, social worker and resident of VIP Road, the non-responsive attitude of officials was to be blamed for the civic mess. Miglani and a resident of Dhakoli, R K Dhiman, said they had complained to the authorities several times, but no action was taken.
