PUNE: An   ( ) officer on Monday alleged that a   ( ) official misbehaved with him at the airport while he was undergoing a security check to board a flight to Nagpur.

 Deepak Singla, a 2012 batch IAS officer currently posted as the circle officer of the Yavatmal Zila Parishad, was about to board a GoAir flight when the incident occurred. 
 
 “I had come to Pune on April 1 as I had to attend a meeting chaired by the CM. Today, I had to catch a morning flight to Nagpur. I reached the airport by 6.45am and was standing in the queue for security check. At the frisking point, a CISF officer told me to put my wallet in the tray, to which I obliged,” Singla told TOI.
 
 While the IAS officer was being frisked, he asked the CISF jawan the reason behind him being asked to keep his wallet on the tray. “I have travelled through different airports and nowhere are passengers asked to keep their wallets on the tray for screening. The CISF man said they had the right to do so and if needed, they could ask me to take off the belt of my trouser as well. Another CISF employee said if I were travelling in a foreign country, I could be asked to take off my trousers for security check,” he said.
 
 He said he found the comments offensive and tweeted about it to CISF headquarters and minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha. 
 
  A CISF official said a complaint has been received and the matter was being looked into.
