MUMBAI: The   on Thursday directed the   (AAI) and   (MIAL) to reply stating how entry to the airport area and its surrounding is regulated.

 The court also sought details of the number of   employed by them and for what work. A bench of Justice Rajendra Savant and Justice Sadhana Jadhav heard a public interest litigation by Yeshwant Shenoy, an advocate, seeking action against AAI officers who had allowed an increase in the height of buildings near the airport.
 
 Shenoy argued that security at the airport is lax and the authorities are least concerned. “After 9/11, every loophole was fixed and America was never attacked again. Here, they are interested in gains. We are sitting ducks,” he claimed. 
 
 Expressing concern, the judges asked what steps are being taken to make the airport safe. “Somebody attacks... (the airport), it means the sovereignty of the nation is attacked,” said Justice Savant. The judges questioned how MIAL, the airport operator, is regulating and monitoring entry on the premises. “Except for CISF persence at entry points, there are all unchecked entries,” remarked Justice Savant, adding that “anyone can show an airline identity card and enter the airport”.
 
 MIAL’s advocate said it only issues passes, while security clearance is handled by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. “We want a proper framework. When there is VIP movement, there’s security drill. For the common people too there should be security,” said Justice Savant.
 
 When MIAL’s advocate pointed out that these security issues were not part of Shenoy’s petition, the judges retorted that it can suo motu look into these issues and it must not be taken as adversarial litigation. “It is for you to come forward and tell us what you have done,” said Justice Jadhav. The court has sought replies from the AAI, MIAL and ministry of civil aviation at the next hearing on August 3.
