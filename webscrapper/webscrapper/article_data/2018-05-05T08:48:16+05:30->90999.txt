JAIPUR:   crisis is giving people of the state real discomfort in these harsh summers, because of which   party women workers organised a unique protest called ‘matka phod’ (breaking the pots) on Friday, in Jaipur.

 All protestors were women and they complained about the negligence of government towards the plight of people who are suffering in this summer and have to travel miles for clean drinking water. Sangeeta Garg, Congress secretary in the state, while addressing the media said, “BJP government has made lots of false promises and made a scheme called ‘Jal Swablambi Yojna’ but if we look at the condition of people these schemes are not properly executed. There are women complaining about piles of dirty laundry in their houses as there is no water. Now, government has to accept that there policies and schemes have failed not just in Jaipur but in the entire state.”
