AGRA: In a freak storm which saw winds with velocity of over 130 km per hour sweeping the city on Wednesday evening, stone minarets on the south and royal gates of the   were damaged.

 
 According to sources, the incident occurred around 7:30 pm when one of the minarets of the south gate fell off and one of small white domes was hit too.
 
 No official of the Archaeological Survey of India was available for comment despite several attempts.
 
 A 12-foot minaret with a metal finial, which is part of the main gate, also called Darwaza-e-rauza, was blown away by high-speed winds. It is from this royal gate that tourists get their first view of the 17th century Mughal-era monument.
 
 Darwaza-e-rauza, the main gateway, is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tombâ€™s archways, and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. 
 
 Earlier in 2016, too, one of the minarets of Taj Mahal was reportedly damaged. While reports had suggested that the minarets might have been affected during cleaning work which was underway, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had then blamed monkeys for weakening it.
 
 Several electricity poles and trees were also uprooted in the storm which killed four in Mathura and one in Bijnor. Three children and a 70-year-old woman were killed in two separate incidents in Farah of Mathura district in the storm that was accompanied by heavy hailstones. Several parts of the district were lashed for nearly 30 minutes, with minimum temperatures dropping to 22 degrees Celsius.
