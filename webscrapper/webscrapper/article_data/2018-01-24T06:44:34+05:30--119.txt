KOLKATA: The   accused of molesting a Bangladeshi national on the 13108 Up Kolkata-Dhaka   on Monday has been identified and suspended. According to a senior official of BSF’s South Bengal Frontier, the force will not press for trial of the constable under the BSF Act but allow civil authorities to proceed against him. 

 According to GRP soures, it is likely that the constable will be arrested. The Bangladeshi deputy high commission in Kolkata will also be contacted to try and get the victim to visit the city again for a test identification (TI) parade. A TI parade has become crucial as it was not the woman but her husband who lodged a complaint to train authorities, who passed it on to the station manager of the Kolkata Terminal. ADG (Railways) Adhir Sharma said, “The case is being investigated. We have sought help from the Bangladesh deputy high commission.” 
 
 “After inquiry, we came to know that constable Veeranna Bhavi of the 99Bn BSF was involved in the incident. We have suspended him and are extending all co-operation to railway authorities. The BSF doesn’t tolerate such behaviour,” said R P S Jaswal, DIG, BSF, South Bengal Frontier.
 
 Monday’s incident has raised questions on why coaches of the Maitree Express have not been fitted with CCTV cameras. Indian Railways has already started fitting CCTV cameras along aisles and the entry and exit points of coaches. “Some trains like the Swarna Rajdhani already have coaches fitted with CCTV cameras. This acts as a deterrent for miscreants. CCTV cameras need to be installed in coaches of trains like the Maitree Express as high security is involved. India should also insist that Bangladesh fit its rakes (that operate as Maitree Express) with surveillance cameras for better security. Such incidents may be avoided if there is better surveillance,” a senior home ministry official said.
