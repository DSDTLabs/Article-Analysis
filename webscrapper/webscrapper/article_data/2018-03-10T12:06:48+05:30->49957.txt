VIJAYAWADA: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning over possible   conditions to prevail from March to June. 

 On Friday, IMD director   said the temperatures are likely to be higher by one degree celsius this year compared to last year. The capital city is likely to feel the heat than the actual temperatures thanks to increased pollution levels and less green cover.
 
 According to YK Reddy, the ‘felt heat’ would be much more than the actual temperature due to high levels of humidity. People tend to sweat more due to humidity and this will be more in urban areas as compared to rural areas due to a lack of green cover and increased pollution levels.
 
 The   (APSDMA) has developed an advanced alert management system to warn people about heatwave conditions in advance. They have developed a system that would send weather alerts to one lakh mobile phones at once. This system is capable of sending alerts to smartphones even in areas where mobile signals are weak.
 
 APSDMA is warning people especially in coastal areas where the felt heat is considerably higher than actual temperatures. A mobile app was developed in association with   (ISRO) which records the actual temperature in a particular area and also the felt heat by taking various factors into consideration.
 
 City lawyers, meanwhile, have welcomed the resolution by Bar Council of India and the Bar Council of State of Andhra Pradesh on dress code relaxation for the summer. Except   lawyers, all others can now attend court without the black coat from March 15 till July 15.
