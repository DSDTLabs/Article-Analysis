JAIPUR: The resignation of   vice-chancellor   over his eligibility criteria once again rings an alarm bell over the manner V-Cs have been appointed in the state varsities. Singhal who faced flak from   for heading the top post despite his academic shortcomings has played a key role in the appointment of vice-chancellors in many universities.

 He has been a part of search committee, which shortlists candidates for the post of V-C, and also a member for several such committees. At present Singhal has been a search committee member in the selection of vice-chancellor in   (Bikaner). TOI learnt that currently six universities need vice-chancellors. The process in two universities— Maharaja Surajmal Brij University (Bharatpur) and Maharaja Ganga Singh University (Bikaner) is at an advanced stage. Here the search committee comprises of one nominee each from governor’s house, state government, UGC and university has submitted the shortlisted candidates to the governer house.
 
 “Many search committee members whose role is to evaluate the resume of hundreds of applicants and to choose one candidate for the top post lack academic excellence,” said a source. The norm says that search committee members should have high academic credentials so that they can objectively evaluate and appoint vice-chancellors.
 
 Meanwhile, the state higher education department is under pressure to ensure that appointments lined up in six universities should be controversy-free. “The shortlisted candidates for universities by the search committees will be evaluated again. Those who do have a PhD degree will be filtered out,” said a higher education department source.
