SAHARSA:Though the public outcry for a bridge over the   river at Dengrahi ghat is yet to settle down, demand for yet another bridge over the same river at Kathdumar ghat, hardly 6km away from the previous bridge site, has stirred the minds of the people of the Kosi diara area. 

 Social workers of the riverine belt have launched a movement, christened ‘Jal Satyagrah’, under which 11 people, including two women activists, are standing in waist deep water of the Kosi.
 
 The villagers have erected a four-feet high platform of bamboo sticks, locally known as machaan, in the coastal water area of the Kosi. About 100 people of the neighbouring villages are sitting on the machaan in support of the ‘Jal Satyagrahis’. 
 
 “As of today, they are neither fasting nor are on indefinite hunger strike. They are simply standing whole day in the Kosi to attract the government’s attention in order to press the demand for bridge at Kathdumar ghat,” said former MLA and BJP functionary Surendra Yadav, who is also steering the present agitation under the banner of Kosi Peedit Sangharsh Morcha. 
 
 Yadav said construction of Dengrahi bridge was still premature and uncertain as the government has started only the survey work to assess the feasibility of the project. 
 
 “The areas of Purnia, Darbhanga, Samastipur and Madhubani districts, which are situated outside the embankments, have tasted the fruits of development while we are caged between eastern and western Kosi embankments which have been left on the mercy of the Kosi. A large number of bridges have been built over various rivers in protected zones. Why can’t there be a few bridges for Kosi sufferers,” he said.
