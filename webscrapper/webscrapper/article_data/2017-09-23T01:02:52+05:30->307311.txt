Madurai: As a step towards realising late President Abdul Kalam’s dream to make people in villagers internet savvy, the ‘digital village programme’ was launched in Kotanathampatti village in Melur taluk on Friday.

 Speaking on the occasion, collector K Veera Raghava Rao said that Kalam’s dream of making rural India internet wise would be realised through this programme. It is being implemented in co-ordination with the Madurai Kamaraj University, Maditssia, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry and banks. Kotanathampatti village was only the beginning and soon it will be implemented in all the villagers in the district, he said.
 
 The main aim of the programme is to make everybody in the district, most importantly people in villages aware of the internet and also make them access it and use it for their benefit. Most of the central and state government schemes were being implemented successfully in the district. All the visionary programmes of the Prime Minister including ‘Digital India’, ‘Make in India’ and ‘Clean India’ were being implemented in an outstanding manner in Madurai setting an example for many others.
 
 He said that using the internet would help pave the way for cashless transactions and bank accounts had been opened for every citizen with this aim. All transactions would be accounted for under the system as the Aadhaar numbers were linked with the accounts.
 
 The programme would help people in the village to gain access to the internet and also educate them on its uses.
