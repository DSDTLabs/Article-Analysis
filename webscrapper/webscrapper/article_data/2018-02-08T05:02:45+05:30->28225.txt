Actors Mohammad Nazim and   attended their close friend actor   Chaudhary’s wedding recently. The wedding was held in Jaipur and was a fun filled affair. Vineet, who is seen in Yeh Hain Mohabbatein was the perfect host and the actors had an amazing time.

 "The wedding was superb. Everything was so well arranged. Winters are almost gone now in Jaipur, yet it was cold. I was really excited to experience the cold weather, as we don’t get much of that in Mumbai," says Nazim.
 
 Nazim looked dapper in a blue ensemble while both Zara and Saurabh stunned in Indian attires. The actors danced the night away and helped themselves to delicious delicacies. 
 
 "Vineet is a great friend and Zara and I just had to come for the wedding. It was like a wedding in the family and we danced so much. The food, decoration and ambience was flawless and amazing," shared Saurabh.
