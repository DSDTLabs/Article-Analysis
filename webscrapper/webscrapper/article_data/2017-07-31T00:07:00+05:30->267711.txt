Pune: In a first, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) will hold a circuit bench sitting in Mumbai from November 6 to 10 for consumer complaints and appeals arising from different parts of the state. 

 A circular released by joint registrar S Hanumantha Rao on July 18 stated, “Any person interested in getting his/her case listed before the circuit bench may file proper application on or before October 27 for appropriate order.”
 
 Lawyers engaged in consumer litigations said the move would benefit scores of litigants from the state as it would be convenient for them to get their cases settled in Mumbai rather than travel to Delhi.
 
 The NCDRC is the apex body of a three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism set up under the Consumer Protection Act for adjudicating consumer complaints involving claims above Rs 1 crore. It has a territorial jurisdiction over the whole country and an appellate jurisdiction over the state consumer commissions. According to the ministry of consumer affairs annual report for 2016-17, the commission has been holding circuit bench sittings every year since 2005. 
 
 An official at the district consumer court here said, “So far, Pune and Nagpur were the only cities from the state to figure among the 14 cities across India notified by the central government where NCDRC can hold its circuit bench sittings in addition to New Delhi where it normally functions. Pune has hosted NCDRC circuit bench sitting a few years ago and last year, it was to host a similar sitting but, the same was called off. This would be Mumbai’s first time hosting such circuit bench sitting.”
