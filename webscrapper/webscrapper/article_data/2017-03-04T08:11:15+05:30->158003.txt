JAUNPUR: The collar of his kurta turned upwards and two buttons undone, when India cricket team former captain   touches his lower lip with his tongue, this eastern Uttar Pradesh town goes weak in the knees. 

 With the same nonchalance that was characteristic of him during post-ceremony speeches, he looks calm on the stage with   party’s Jaunpur candidate Nadeem Javed. The popular leader enjoys proximity with the party’s vice president Rahul Gandhi.
 
 The hysteria over Azhar is so much that he is forced to quip, “Bhai araam se, mujhe roadshow se pehle run out mat kara dena”. An uproar follows. 
 
 Nearly 17 years after he played his last ODI, Azhar remains a hero. After all, one of his three centuries in 1984-85 that made him a superstar was in Uttar Pradesh’s.
 
 Azhar takes direct swipes at the BJP and the Prime Minister over the comments involving ‘kabrisatan’ and electricity.
 
 “Don’t listen to the negative people around you. What PM is saying or other members of the opposition are telling you are nasty things. I never looked at my opposition when I played my cricket. Just concentrate on your own campaign style. Tagde hoke khelo aur vote daalo,” he tells voters.
 
 As he climbs into the makeshift open jeep, there are demands to seek his autograph. He chooses another way of entertainment. He breaks down the   garland around him and throws out the flowers at the the delirious crowd, yelling, “Catch it”.
 
 In between, Javed congratulates the one who takes the catch and jokingly rebukes those who miss it.
 
 As teenage boys wave cricket bats at him, beseeching him for a game with them, Azhar says he is short on time as he has to leave for Varanasi, which demands a bigger campaign by him.
 
 There are some in the crowd who want to engage him over his biopic Azhar. He doesn’t disappoint and lends them an ear too.
