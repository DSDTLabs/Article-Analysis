NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday granted exemption to Union finance minister   and AAP leader   from personal appearance in a criminal defamation case filed by the   leader. 

 The other accused in the case - CM   and AAP members Raghav Chadha, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Deepak Bajpai - have been acquitted after Jaitley accepted their apologies for their statements in the alleged irregularities in the DDCA.
 
 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate   granted the exemption after Jaitley's advocate   moved an application, saying the BJP leader was undergoing treatment. Appearing for Vishwas, advocate Mohd Irshad also moved an application citing prior engagements and sought exemption from personal appearance for Saturday. The court posted the matter for May 11.
