PM Nawaz   said on Tuesday that Pakistan was a progressive country where no one could force others to adopt a certain religion. “It is not for us to decide who will go to heaven or hell, but our duty is to make this place a heaven on earth,” Sharif said in a Holi event.

 “Forced conversion is a crime in Islam,” he said. Sharif said his duty was to serve the followers of all religions. “God will not ask aruler what he did for followers of a certain religion,” said Sharif. 
 
 “Prophets preached religion and forced nobody to accept teachings. Our Constitution consists of these principles.” “Pakistan was not created to oppose any religion, but to prevent religious persecution.”
