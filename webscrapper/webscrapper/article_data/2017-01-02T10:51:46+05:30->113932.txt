MADURAI: A 22-year-old lecturer of a polytechnic college was stabbed by a man, whose marriage proposal she rejected, when she stepped out of a church after attending the mid-night mass in Kanyakumari district on Saturday. The victim,  , daughter of Anthony from Chinnathurai village, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.

 The accused,  , 27, from   near Nithiraivilai in Kanyakumari, had been stalking the woman for several months seeking intimacy, police sources said. “Biju used to constantly pursue and harass the woman, working as a faculty in a private polytechnic college in Tirunelveli district. She repeatedly rebuffed his proposal and even had lodged a complaint against him at the Nithiraivilai Police Station. We had picked Biju up for inquiries, but released him after severe warnings,” a police officer told TOI.
 
 However, after coming to know that the woman’s marriage has been fixed on January 5, Biju tried to contact her again, the officer said. “Learning that she is attending a prayer meet at the local church on the New Year night, he waited outside the church. He confronted her when she came out of the church. But the woman rebuffed him again. The angry man took out a lethal weapon and stabbed her. Though he tried to escape, churchgoers managed to catch him. He was thrashed severely, before handed over to the police,” the officer added.
 
 A case was registered and the accused was remanded in judicial custody.
