RAMNAGAR: As PM   ended his UP campaign with a visit to India's second prime minister  's  , the independence hero and former prime minister's daughter-in-law likened BJP's strongman to God. “Let me tell you the way Narendra Modi won from the Hindi heartland in 2014 and has made frequent visits to temples and helped the devotees get their dues on Ganga ghats, he is a God for them. He's messiah for all the faithful who look up to him for their development whether Malhars (OBC boatmen) or Brahmins and purohits,“ said Neera Shastri. She quit the Congress in 1993 to serve the BJP's Mahila morcha wing of Delhi unit.

 Shashtri's elder son Sunil, who was present during Modi's visit, accused Gandhi family of favouring only one Nehru dynasty while ignoring several families at the forefront of freedom movement.
 
 “I think top leadership of Congress has never allowed any political family to grow out of their stature. P V Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesri were latest victims. My father deserved much more respect at least in Parliament or at rallies when Indiraji or Rajivji were alive“ said Sunil.
 
 Earlier, Neera also accused the UPA government of removing his names from the textbooks in schools and college courses. Modi's visit was a first by any sitting PM to Shastri's ancestral house that is now being converted into museum with his memorabilia from the pre-Independence days. The Shashtri family said they even requested Modi to furnish the memorial with modern facilities, keeping his books, clothes, stationery intact.
