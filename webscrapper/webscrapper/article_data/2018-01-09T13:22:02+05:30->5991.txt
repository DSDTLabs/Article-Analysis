MADURAI: Frustrated over the lack of a proper road to the village crematorium, a group of villagers from   near   in Madurai district staged a novel protest by bringing a miniature ‘paadai’ ( ), used to carry dead bodies to the collector’s office on Monday. However, police thwarted their protest and detained them. 

 About 17 villagers had come to the collectorate to submit a petition during the grievances redressal meeting by bringing the ‘paadai’, creating a ruckus.
 
 According to their petition, the villagers do not have a proper road to the crematorium and have to walk inside the riverbed to reach it. After prolonged struggle, they managed to get hold of a piece of land from one PKM Mookan Ambalam in the locality and laid a dirt road. But the last stretch towards this road and crematorium is with a private party falling in Kalikappan Bit II village administration. They also require a small bridge on   after that, to reach the crematorium.
 
 They managed to pass a resolution at   panchayat earlier seeking the bridge from authorities. Having fulfilled all requirements for the road, they now demanded the district administration to help them get the piece of land which is under private custody, so that they can have a proper road and need not struggle to reach the crematorium site.
 
 The villagers had in their possession the attachments of all documents and a copy of a prior petition they had submitted to the Madurai collector’s office on February 29, 2016. But even before they could reach the grievance meeting hall on Monday, Tallakulam police rounded them up and took them into custody. They were detained for a day and released later in the evening, police said.
