PATNA:   (BPMC) and other frontal organizations of the Congress on Monday took out a ‘Thali Pito’ march in the state capital and at all district headquarters to demand an impartial probe into the party vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s allegations against PM  . Rahul had accused the PM of receiving money from Sahara group when he was the Gujarat CM. The Congress has also denounced the demonetisation of old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes.

 BPMC members, led by its state president Amita Bhushan (MLA), gathered near the Golghar here and raised slogans against the Centre’s decision of note ban. They, later, marched towards the collectorate while banging plates to draw people’s attention towards their demand.
 
 Workers of the Congress’s other frontal organizations like Youth Congress, NSUI and Seva Dal also joined the procession. They submitted a memorandum to a district official seeking impartial probe into the allegations against the PM.
 
 Similar ‘Thali Pito’ (Plate banging) marches were organized at different district headquarters across the state by the members of Mahila Congress, Bhushan said.
