THRISSUR: As many as 100 State   (SBI) branches--or those of its five associated banks--in Kerala will down shutters when they merge into a single entity on April 1, SBI managing director   said here on Saturday.

 Across the country, 1,500 branches would cease to exist, he said during an informal interaction. However, the footprints of SBI would be ensured in areas, especially in rural India.
 
 Kumar said the decision to merge five associated   with SBI would not be rolled back. “The government has already notified the merger. We have drawn up a detailed roadmap for its execution,’’ he said.
 
 The SBI chief said bank employees need not be concerned over the merger since it would benefit them in the long run. He also dispelled fears that the proposed merger would end up with banks losing sensitivity to the concerns and requirements of customers.
 
 Kumar said the proposal to levy service charges and the insistence on minimum balance in savings bank accounts would not be altered, since such conditions were essential to meet the operational expenditure of the accounts and to reduce superfluous expenditures.
 
 “But we may review the rates,’’ he said.
 
 The shortage of currency notes subsequent to the   has been addressed, but for some geographical areas such as north Kerala. He said Kerala would require Rs 500 crore at a go to tide over the shortage.
