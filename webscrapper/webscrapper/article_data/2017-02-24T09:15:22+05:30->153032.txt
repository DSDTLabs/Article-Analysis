KOLKATA: CPM leader Surjya Kanta Mishra’s wife Usha was granted bail by a   on Thursday after she surrendered. Two others named in the FIR, Mishra’s nephew Sudip and relative Dibyendu, were also granted bail. Three of them are prime accused in a West Midnapore-based  , Bhagavati Devi Nari Kalyan Samiti, fund embezzlement case being probed by state anti-corruption branch (ACB).

 The case surfaced in March, 2015 after ACB officials raided the NGO’s office. The NGO received a grant of Rs 30.85 lakh between 2007-11 to combat and sensitize locals about AIDS. The fund is primarily distributed among agencies across states by   (NACO) given they follow certain preset guidelines. 
 
 Based on a complaint of misappropriation of funds by Biplab Das, former director of WBSAPCS, ACB found at least 400 disputed bills, invoices and false vouchers issued against a few companies. Further, the NGO violated NACO’s rule of involving sex workers and hired housewives. They also paid in cash while NACO certified cheque payments should be made for amounts above Rs 2,000.
 
 The case also involves alleged role of the assistant director of West Bengal State Aids Prevention & Control Society (WBSAPCS), Shakti Kapoor, who granted more funds to the NGO despite being aware of the misappropriation.
