Soon, schools of   could be swimming around in oceans helping   learn more about  . ‘SoFi,’ short for’ ‘Soft Robotic Fish,’ was developed by scientists at MIT to study ocean life and help protect it from the threats of human intrusion and  .

 
 
 
 
 
 SoFi is a 1.5-foot robot with fins and a silicon tail that help it swim forward and change directions. It can swim at a speed of almost one foot per second at up to 60 feet deep.Its battery runs for 45 minutes and it is equipped with a camera environmental sensors and a communication system, which receives commands from a Super Nintendo console controller and can relay data to scientists from about 65 feet away.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 To observe marine life, scientists normally use remote operated devices — expensive, noisy, large that tended to scare animals away . But SoFi is small and inexpensive, and since it mimics fish, creatures often swim alongside the robot, giving the robot the best view of marine life in action. In the future, scientists could use SoFis to study movement patterns of ocean life and monitor pollution.
