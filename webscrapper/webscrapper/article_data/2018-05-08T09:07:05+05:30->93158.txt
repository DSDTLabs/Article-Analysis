PUNE: A 15-year-old brain-dead boy’s vital organs gave a new lease of life to end-stage organ diseases in Pune, Chennai and Nashik on Monday.

 The boy’s mother had consented to donate his vital organs at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital here on Monday. The harvested heart was flown to Chennai and transplanted into a 36-year-old electronic engineer from Kerala at Global Hospital. 
 
 
  
 
 Via a green corridor, the liver was transported to Nashik’s Sahyadri hospital and transplanted into a 56-year-old businessman from Aurangabad. One kidney benefited a 47-year-old realtor at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and the other was transplanted into a 27-year-old woman at Sassoon. 
 
 “Our medical staff has been monitoring the brain-dead boy on the life-support system since May 5, hoping for the family’s consent,” said the hospital’s dean, spine surgeon  .
 
 The boy’s family hails from Mandavgaon village in Ahmednagar. “His father is a constable with Karjat police station. His mother, who convinced the family to donate organs, is a homemaker. He has a younger sister,” said medical social worker  .
 
 He had sustained serious head injuries in a motorcycle accident on May 3, Rathod said. He was rushed to the Civil hospital in Ahmednagar and later shifted to Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune on May 4. He was moved to Sassoon the same evening. “He was declared brain-dead around 6.19pm on May 5,” Rathod said.
 
 The family initially didn’t want to donate his organs. “After a little convincing, first his mother, and soon the rest of his family, agreed on Monday,” Rathod said, “We informed Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC).”
 
 The organs were allocated as per norms. “He was the 25th brain-dead patient this year, whose family donated vital organs,” said transplant coordinator Aarti Gokhale of ZTCC.
