Tabla maestro   Qureshi’s earliest memories of his father, the legendary tabla player  , are of sitting on stage with him. He was all of six then. He recalls, “I always used to sit in between two stalwarts,   and my father, and listen intently while they played.” 

 Meanwhile, Fazal is all set to ring in his father’s centenary year with a special programme this weekend. “Along with actor-storyteller Danish Husain, we will be recreating some of my father’s compositions, which will be interspersed with the narration of the story of his life. This is the first time that I have included a little bit of theatre on stage along with the usual music.” 
 
 Not many are aware that Ustad Allarakha was among the first to use sargam instead of words in a song. “In 1950, for the movie Sabak, my father used notes as lyrics. That was unique in those days. Much later, the   did something similar. My father also composed for Punjabi movies, collaborated with drummers and other musicians, worked with South Indian musicians — which was rare then.” 
 
 In the 40s-50s, tabla players would always sit behind, while the main instrumentalist would sit in front. However, Ustad Allarakha changed that and literally brought tabla to the forefront. Fazal says, “My father used to say, ‘To cover that little distance on stage, it took me 40 years’. Tabla was always considered an accompanying instrument, and my father made it into the main instrument. I feel that was one of his greatest achievements.”
