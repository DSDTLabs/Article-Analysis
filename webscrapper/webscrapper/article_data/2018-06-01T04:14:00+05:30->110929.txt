Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will launch a major cleanliness drive in the city from Friday. The civic body will ensure that all debris and garbage from open spaces and roadside is removed during the drive.

 VMC had conducted a similar drive last year, but did not do much after the monsoon 
 
 The civic body has decided to rope in 20-25 earthmovers and other vehicles to clear the debris. Special focus will be laid on cleaning of open spots in the city. Those involved with the drive will have to continuously post updates regarding the work being done along with pictures on a chat group.
 
 VMC additional city engineer Shailesh Naik said that those dumping debris in the open and creating menace will also be penalised during the drive. He added that the door-to-door garbage collection system will also be improved.tnn
