Residents of   were hopeful that Thiru Vi Ka Park, a major lung space in the locality that was shut in 2011, with nearly 150 trees axed, would be restored soon after the   station was thrown open. But much to their dismay, there has been no sign of the park returning to its original shape even more than a year after Shenoy Nagar metro station started operations. 

 
 
  
 
 Now, Chennai   ( ) has said it would take two more years to restore of the park as it has now planned a multi-level parking under the park for which it will excavate again.
 
 But right now, there is another pressing issue the park patrons want CMRL to address. They say the area around the barricaded metro site at the park is being used for unauthorised parking and has turned into a hub for anti-social activities after nightfall.
 
 “Buses and trucks are parked around the site and people consume alcohol on the road. It was once safe for people to walk around the park even after dark. Now we cannot think of doing that,” said A S Arul, vice-president of  .
 
 The residents said when several resident associations in Shenoy Nagar, Anna Nagar and surrounding localities appealed to CMRL to restore the park soon or build a temporary pavement around the site for regular walkers to use, they were directed to approach the corporation. “We asked them to build the pavement as there was no sign of restoring the park. It will also keep antisocial elements away,” said Rebecca Pothan, a resident.
 
 Arul said when approached, corporation officials refused to build a pavement, saying the civic body could not “waste funds to build a temporary pavement”. “Already, 40% of the park has gone for building the entry structures for the metro station and now we may not get whatever is left of the park any time soon. The least that CMRL can do is to ensure our safety,” he said.
