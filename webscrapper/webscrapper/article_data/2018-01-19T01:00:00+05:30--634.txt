The last few years have seen a different side of   as an actor. Along with action and comedy, he has been exploring a variety of genres, delivering some gritty and memorable performances. And now, writer-director R. Balki has said that Akshay’s performance in his next, ' ', “is one of the finest by an Indian actor”. 
Revealing how the superstar effortlessly slipped into the character of   — the inventor of a low-cost sanitary pad-making machine on whom the movie is based — the filmmaker says, "“Arunachalam is a simple man, and Akshay, too, is an unassuming, no-fuss person. So, I thought that he was naturally right for the role. He has imbibed Arunachalam’s simplicity so well that it is wonderful to watch him on screen.” 
 Elaborating on the actor’s ‘remarkably restrained performance’, Balki says, “It’s not about saying a lot; Arunachalam is the kind of man who just smiles and insists that he hasn’t done much, and that takes a lot of character. Akshay understood him perfectly and essayed the part beautifully.” 
 One of the highlights of the film, which also stars   and  , is its climax. Akshay performed the 10-minute dialogue-heavy scene with a three-camera set-up in just one take. Balki recalls, “We thought we’d divide the shots because the scene was heavy on emotions and expressions, but Akshay got it right it in the first take.” 
 Summing up, Balki says, “Akshay doesn’t intellectualise acting. He does his homework quietly, understands his character and portrays it in his own way. Everyone knows him as a star, but in 'Padman', his performance is extremely nuanced; it’s one of the finest by an Indian actor.” 
 'Padman', produced by   Movies, SPE Films India, Kriarj Entertainment, Cape of Good Films and Hope Productions, and released worldwide by SPE Films India, releases on January 25.
