NEW DELHI: A 46-year-old   was   after his   in central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal on Friday night. 

 Police said the victim, Iqbal, was paralysed since he had an accident two months back and was alone at his rented house at the time of the incident. His wife and three daughters had gone out for a wedding, while his son was at another function. The house caught fire because of a short-circuit. “He must have cried out for help but the incident happened late at night. No one could come and help him,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 Neighbours informed the fire services and the police when they saw smoke coming out of the house. A neighbour also informed Iqbal’s wife. “Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot after the call. It took us over half an hour to douse the flames. By the time the situation could be controlled, Iqbal had already died,” a fire official said.
 
 Iqbal was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. “He sustained 80% burns. His body was sent for a postmortem,” a police officer said.
 
 The police have started a probe into the incident. “A short circuit appears to have started the fire. We have started an investigation to ascertain the exact cause,” a police officer said.
