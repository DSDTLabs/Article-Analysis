Panaji: Voters can now get their names added, corrected or deleted on the electoral roll online, with the launch of the Election Commissionâ€™s ERO-net. The electorate can log on to http://www.nvsp.in, even on their mobile phones, upload a photograph, documents of age and address proof, following which the booth level officer (BLO) will contact them to get the details verified.  Citizens will also receive alerts and notifications once they register their mobile number on the website. During the present special summary revision that began on Monday, the electorate has been encouraged to go online to make corrections and change. This process will continue till October 17. The draft electoral roll will be kept open for claims and objections from citizens. The unified platform for maintaining electoral rolls throughout the country that was launched by governor Mridula Sinha on Monday is expected to eliminate duplicate EPIC IDs. When a person relocates from one state to another, he will be able to retain his unique voter ID card number, with changes made in the address only, chief electoral officer Kunal said. He explained that in the past, each state would follow its own method for updating its electoral roll. This new system will change the way the election machinery interacts with voters, Kunal said.
