NOIDA: Calling for awareness about security while using any new technology,   chairman RS   on Friday said private vendors of new technology sell them to customers in a way that makes the latter completely dependent and vendor-locked.

 In a candid address to students of   in Noida on Friday, he also spoke about the gullibility of government officials before new technologies that they are not conversant with. People in the government, he said, have to educate themselves. “Whenever a new technology comes, there are vendors who sell you the technology and they will sell it to you in a way that will make you completely dependent and locked. This is a typical thing. We in the government are not very knowledgeable about technology and think we know everything. So these two make a very dangerous combination,” he added. As a result, he said, “many times we get into the trap of getting into vendor lobbying”.
 
 Later, when asked by reporters about telecom tribunal TDSAT’s direction to Trai asking it to take a stand on Reliance Jio’s free 4G service, Sharma said, “We will come to a conclusion in reasonable time.”
