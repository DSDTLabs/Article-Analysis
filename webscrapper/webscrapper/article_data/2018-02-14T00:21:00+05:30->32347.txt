Pune: Pune-based Relfor Labs has launched Bakeway.com, its new venture that brings more than 350 bakeries and 75 home bakers from across the city on a single platform.

 Deepak Nathani, the CEO of Relfor said he has invested Rs 3 crore in the venture and plans to take it national over the course of the next two years with a total investment of over Rs 10 crore. He also mentioned plans for expanding the venture to offer snacks and party combos from bakeries.
 
 “Users are required to enter their preferred locality within the city and follow few quick steps to order cakes from the best bakeries and home bakers in town,” Relfor said in a statement.
 
 Nathani, who invests actively in other start-ups and ideas and was also the co-founder and former COO of Cybage, said online activity in the start-up space is increasingly becoming niche. “Looking at the current e-commerce trend, consumers are more inclined towards the niche online marketplaces,” he said.
