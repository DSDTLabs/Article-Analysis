Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Police on Tuesday registered an FIR against ‘Raja Chouhan’ — allegedly the man seen firing shots at a mob in Gwalior during Monday’s bandh.

 Chouhan has been booked under IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and is currently at large. A video showing a man in white shirt firing from his revolver had gone viral on Monday. A video grab of it made it to the front page of most newspapers and news channels put the footage on a loop to show how lawlessness ran riot on Monday.
 
 The name ‘Raja Chouhan’ cropped up in a tweet by BSP spokesperson Devashish Jarariya. “The person who’s firing from his pistol is Raja Chouhan from Gwalior. He turned Bharat Bandh into caste violence and killed three Dalits. He was my school senior,” he tweeted. It was quickly picked up by various social media.
 
 Raja’s family is furious and plans to lodge a police complaint against the BSP spokesperson. “Jarariya’s tweet has plunged our family in deep stress. The man seen with a revolver is not my brother Raja. But because of the tweet, my whole family has come under threat,” Raja’s elder brother Sohan Chouhan told TOI, adding: “Jarariya took pictures from Raja’s Facebook and circulated it all over. This is not only a crime but he has also put Raja’s life at risk.”
 
 On other hand, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani posted a tweet citing threat to Jarariya. “My friend and BSP spokesperson is being threatened of dire consequences. If he is hurt in any manner, the administration will be responsible,” Mevani tweeted.
 
 IG-intelligence Makrand Deoskar told reporters that Chouhan was booked on the basis of a complaint and he will be arrested soon.
