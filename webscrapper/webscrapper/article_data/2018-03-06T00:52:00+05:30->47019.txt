Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high on Monday directed the state’s school education secretary to file a counter to a petition that sought to quash a government order fixing different pass marks for practical and non-practical subjects in higher secondary courses.

 One K R Ramalingam filed the case. It came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel told the court that till 2016-17 there was no government examination for Class XI. In that situation, the education department passed a government order on May 22, 2017 introducing a new system according to which the Plus One examination was made as government examination and fixed 600 marks for Class XI and 600 marks for Class XII.
 
  Subsequently, on August 9, 2017 it passed a government order fixing guidelines for examinations and awarding marks for 11th standard.
 
 In the higher secondary course, there are two types of subjects – practical and non-practical. As per the new scheme, scoring 21.47% of marks is sufficient for a student to pass in practical subjects. But, in the case of non-practical papers, a student has to get 22.77% marks. It is against the constitutional provisions.
 
 The government should fix same percentage of marks to practical and non-practical subjects. The new system also introduced internal marks for non-practical papers, in which there is a discrimination in fixation of marks, the petitioner said.
 
 The government side sought time to file a counter to the case, which the court accepted.
