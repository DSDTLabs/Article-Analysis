NEW DELHI:   on Sunday demanded the resignation of   chief minister   after he was chargesheeted by CBI in a disproportionate assets (DA) case.
 
  The party also used the opportunity to take a potshot at   vice-president  , questioning his silence over the issue.
  
  On Friday, the Delhi high court had refused to quash the DA case filed by CBI against Singh and his wife, saying there was no basis to claim that the FIR was the result of any “political vendetta”.
  
  “Unfortunately, the Congress does not appear to be keen to fight against black money despite popular sentiments against it. Congress appears to be with people charged with black money… Farmer Virbhadra Singh amassed disproportionate assets ostensibly by ferrying apples on scooters… Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi should make this secret formula public to the farmers of the country,” BJP general secretary   said addressing a press conference at party headquarters.
  
  “Virbhadra Singh should resign at least on moral grounds. If Congress doesn’t take his resignation, it will reestablish Congress’ compromise with corruption,” Yadav said while demanding the resignation of Himachal Pradesh CM.
