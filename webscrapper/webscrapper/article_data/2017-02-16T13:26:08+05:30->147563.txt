BHOPAL: Authorities are working on a war footing at   in Bhopal, the alma mater of chief minister  , before upcoming ‘Mile Banchey’  .

 Chouhan studied here till primary level and the work acquired an urgency as the CM is slated to teach here on February 18. On Wednesday, when TOI visited the school, it was found 12 new fans were installed, cracks in the walls were filled with a fresh coat of paints, new chairs and some other furniture waited at a corner to be unwrapped.
 
 As a labourer peeled off outer surface a classroom wall to repaint, students peeped through the windows to see their classrooms getting newer. They smiled and looked delighted, hardly knowing about the upcoming programme.
 
 Though ‘Mamaji’s’ becoming teacher for a day and their school getting a makeover clearly excites them, they are not able to concentrate on their studies properly due to ongoing work.
 
 “We are waiting to get our classroom fitted with fans. Till then we will sit in other classroom and study together with other students,” said a group of school students pointing to their seniors’ classroom. Asked what they would ask the CM for on ‘Mile Banchey’ programme, one of the students,  , said she would ask for a computer laboratory for the students.
