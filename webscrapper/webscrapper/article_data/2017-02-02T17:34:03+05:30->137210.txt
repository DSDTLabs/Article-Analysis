LUCKNOW: Desperation to perform in West Uttar Pradesh just like they did during Lok Sabha election has, it seems, forced the BJP chief   to walk-down, talk and convince the voters in party's favour. The BJP chief would make door-to-door contact with the voters in Meerut in favour of the party candidates. 

 Interestingly, Shah's focus on West UP through a 'padyatra' would come a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address first rally after election notification at Meerut itself. The West UP is the region where election would be held in the first phase on February 11. 
 
 Interestingly, this would be first time when a national chief of the BJP would be holding padyatra in support of candidates. 
 
 Shah would hold padyatra for around two hours, a party leader said and added that he would begin his yatra from Meerut's Purani Chungi and walk down till Ghanta Ghar.
  
 On way, Shah would seek vote and support for party candidate and former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpayi, another sitting MLA and party's candidate from Meerut Cantt Satyaprakash Agrawal and party's candidate Somendra Tomar. Interestingly, from Purani Chungi to Ghanta Ghar, Shah would be covering 2 kilometres distance. He is expected to cover the distance in two hours. 
 
 "Its a special blessing from the party chief that he would be making door-to-door contact with the voters in my constituency," Laxmikant Bajpayi said and added that though the party chief wants to hold padyatra for complete two kilometres, "I have made an alternative arrangement for vehicle from the midway". 
 
 Shah after holding the padyatra would leave for Dhaulana in Hapur district and address a rally in support of party candidate Ramesh Chandra Tomar and then a rally at Khurja in support of Virendra Khatik. 
 
 Shah would then make a night state at Mathura, where national secretary Srikant Sharma is the party candidate this time. Shah is expected to hold programmes in support of party candidates on January 4.
