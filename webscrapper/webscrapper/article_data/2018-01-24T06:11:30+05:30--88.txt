HYDERABAD: In what can be best described as a mockery of democracy, the state enacts laws that disallows MPs and MLAs from holding an  , but, at the same time, comes up with another law that provides immunity to such elected representatives and enables them to hold such offices.

 The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi may not have succeeded in its MLAs continuing to hold offices of profit, but successive state governments in unified AP and present   have provided immunity to 116 posts from coming under the purview of the Office of Profit by which elected representatives holding such positions will be disqualified.
 
 To the 116, the Telangana government during the past three-and-a-half years has added five. Amendments were made to the Telangana Payment of Salaries and Pension and Removal of Disqualification Act, 1953 (TPSPRD Act). The Act pertains to salaries of elected representatives, their pensions and list of posts that cannot be deemed as offices of profit.
 
 
 
 
 The TRS government added the five posts between May 2015 and Dec 2017, including chairman of SC Cooperative Corporation Limited, Samskruthika Saradhi and Drinking Water Supply Corporation (renamed as Mission Bhagiratha). KCR happens to be the chairman of Mission Bhagiratha.
 
 The vice-chairman of Mission Bhagiratha was also included to accommodate Balkonda MLA Vemula Prashanth Reddy. In Dec 2017, the post of   chairman was added and MLC Md   appointed. “Both VC of Mission Bhagiratha and Waqf Board appointments were made through a GO before TPSPRD Act was amended in the assembly,” a senior GAD official said.
 
  for Good Governance secretary M Padmanabha Reddy said: “State governments have been finding ways to appoint MLAs and MLCs and giving them cabinet ranks. This is not acceptable.”
