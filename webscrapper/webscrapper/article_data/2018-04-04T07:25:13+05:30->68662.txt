CHENNAI: In a reprieve to actor Arvind Swami, the   on Tuesday restrained income tax department from taking coercive action against the actor for alleged tax default. 

 Justice T S   granted the interim relief on a plea moved by the actor against the action of the department which had blocked Rs 96.41 lakh from his bank account. According to Swami, for the assessment year 2017-18 and 2018-19, he had remitted advance tax of Rs 1.25 crore based on his estimate of income to be earned. While so, he got a communication from the department dated February 9 directing payment of advance tax of Rs 2.51 crore based on the return filed by him for the assessment year 2017-18.
 
 But as the income estimated for assessment year 2018-19 is much lower than the previous year, the actor sent his auditor to the department and after discussion he was allegedly told to pay first instalment of Rs 30 lakh on or before March 15. "As advised I remitted Rs 30 lakh on March 15. But as I was genuinely unaware of the requirement to file appropriate forms to the department after the remittance, I failed to submit such forms," the actor said. While so he received a communication from the department that Rs 96.41 lakh has been claimed form his bank account for tax default. Aggrieved by the notice, Swami has approached the HC.
