JAIPUR: In a press release from New York,   Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières ( ) said US president Donald J Trump’s executive order suspending refugee resettlement to the United States is “an inhumane act against people fleeing war zones”.

 “Every day our teams on the ground see people desperately seeking safety at closed borders and in war zones from which they cannot flee,” said Jason Cone, executive director of MSF-USA. “Slamming shut the doors to the United States of America, which has rigorously vetted refugees for years, is an attack on the basic accepted notion that people should be able to flee for their lives.”
 
 The release said nearly five million people have fled Syria into neighboring countries, including Jordan and Lebanon, which have populations smaller than many American states (the United States, by contrast, has accepted fewer than 20,000 Syrian refugees). “Many more Syrians are trapped inside their country, including tens of thousands in the desert near the closed Jordanian border, and at other closed borders throughout the region.” The MSF noted that the presidential order will now keep people trapped in war zones, endangering their lives. 
 
 “In conflict zones from Syria to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, these hardships include attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure (including hospitals), the denial of aid, and policies preventing people from fleeing,” the note said, calling on the government to lift the ban.
 
 Meanwhile, a report in Washington Post claimed that the executive order did not extend to Muslim countries where president Trump had business interests like Indonesia, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. All seven nations that face visitation restrictions -- Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya -- are countries where Trump has no business interests, the newspaper reported.
