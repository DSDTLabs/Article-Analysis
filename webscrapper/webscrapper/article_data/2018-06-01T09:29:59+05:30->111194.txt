  : "It's easier than you think," says advisor, trainer, mentor and author,  , who is an 'ex-smoker' for over a decade, for good. 

 Nicotine is a strong addiction and many while trying to quit, light it up again. A few regular and heavy smokers overcome the dark desire. But a very few exhale out of the vicious cycle of addiction.
 
 At 64, Gorowala admits he should have stopped smoking about three decades back. "My message would be don't blame yourself even if you cannot give it up. It will to difficult. Looking back, I am sure it is easier to quit being a smoker," said Gorowala, who has worked as a mentor for some of the top MNCs, discovering passion and purpose in life lies in being a 'change and growth catalyst'.
 
  Off-smoking for over a decade, Gorowala admits that he attempted to quit smoking over 200 times. A decade back, he had a persistent cough. "I did not feel good. I quit smoking. However, the first few years were not easy. Every single day, the urge to smoke was a constant battle. Ultimately, I felt physically and mentally stronger," said Gorowala. 
 
  Awadh Kumar (42) was a   chewer for over four years. A construction civil worker, Kumar quit consuming tobacco in 2014. It came after a visit to a cancer facility with his friend. The horrific picture of miseries of victims and the trauma families suffered made Awadh rethink his life choice. 
 
  "Mentally I did feel right. The addiction drew me away from regular food and I seemed to have no control over my urge. I could not stop being a slave of tobacco," he admits. Nicotine beats a direct path to the brain, where it provides both relaxation and a small energy boost. "In reality it lost my patience. My addiction affected my family and others too. I finally quit. I have been clean for four years now," said Kumar.
