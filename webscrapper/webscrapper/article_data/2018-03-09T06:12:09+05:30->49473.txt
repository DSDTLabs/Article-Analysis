JALANDHAR : No ally in a coalition should be allowed to leave and the main party has to walk more than half the way. This was stated by   (SAD) leader and   MP Naresh Gujral in reaction to the Telugu Desam Party’s ( ) decision to pull out its two ministers from the Narendra Modiled   government.

 Speaking to the TOI on Thursday, Gujral said efforts should be made to keep the alliance of the NDA partners intact in the national interest. Gujral had played a very crucial role in bringing the TDP back to the NDA fold in 2014 and the senior   leaders and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu had announced the alliance in his presence in April 2014 in Hyderabad.
 
 He was the main negotiator between the two parties over seat sharing, and after several rounds of negotiations with both sites, he managed to stitch the alliance.
 
 “The TDP has certain demands which right now they feel that Centre is not meeting. It is unfortunate that they are withdrawing but at the same time they are still part of the NDA so doors are not permanently shut and that is a good thing as this leaves room for developing an understanding in future,” he said.
 
 “A coalition partner should never be allowed to go away. The main party has to walk more than half the way,” he said while adding, “we are still trying that they stay with the NDA in future”.
 
 “Andhra CM Naidu has his own compulsions and at the same time Union government is bound by the Finance Commission recommendation that it can’t give special status to any state other than those specified by the Commission. The cabinet can’t go against those recommendations and finance minister   has said he is ready to help the state but can’t give special status. We hope some way out would be found as keeping the alliance intact is in national interest,” he said.
