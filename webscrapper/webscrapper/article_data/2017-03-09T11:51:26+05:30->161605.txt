PUNE: Protected areas of the district make an ideal habitat for leopards but the big cats often fall into   located along the  . At times, such falls also result in the   

 In the past year alone, the organisation Wildlife SOS has rescued eight such leopards around Pune region. 
 
 In a statement Wildlife SOS explained, “Buffer areas are dotted with uncovered wells that often prove fatal for leopards. The increased rate of habitat encroachment has resulted in decreasing prey base, territory and water sources for such predator species and they are forced to come out into human habitation.”
 
 Since leopards usually prefer to move around at night, it is common for them to slip into the uncovered wells, the note observed. It is estimated that open wells have claimed over 1,500 animals in Maharashtra alone over the last decade.
 
 Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinary officer at the  , pointed out, “In 2016 alone, eight leopards including a pair of cubs have been rescued. In tragic incident, a severely injured hyena was rescued from a well in Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, but it succumbed to its injuries.”
 
 The expert further stated that there is a need to cover such open wells. As of now, the organisation has filed an online petition asking the Pune district collector to order covering or fencing of open wells.
 
 “The issue cannot be taken lightly. It is not just leopards, a species protected under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, that are vulnerable, but also several other species that may suffer a fatal fall,” said Wildlife SOS co-founder Geeta Seshamani.
