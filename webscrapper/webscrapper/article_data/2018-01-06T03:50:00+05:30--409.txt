Panaji: Alleging that chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s letter to Karnataka’s BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa is being waved at election meetings across Karnataka, Sudeep Dalvi of   Warriors said that the party is merely looking at gaining electoral points via the letter.

 “The letter is an intra-BJP affair to fool the people of Goa as well as the people of Karnataka and to gain electoral points in the Karnataka elections. One party is playing games at our cost for their personal gains in the elections,” Dalvi said, while addressing reporters on Friday.
 
 The letter was uncalled for, especially considering that the case before the tribunal is on, a group member, Kennedy Afonso said.
 
 The group will hold protests throughout the state, especially along the Mhadei river. The first protest will be held on January 7, at 10am at the footsteps of the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church, Panaji.
