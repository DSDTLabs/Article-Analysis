NEW DELHI: After a forceful intervention from National Green Tribunal ( ), the north and south   have started a  , especially   and industrial units. According to the report of the north civic body, most common violators of the norms are the construction sites, 1,194 of which have been challaned with a total penalty of over Rs 3.3crore in the north corporation.

 Construction dust of PM10 and PM2.5 sizes is the major polluter in the capital. A spokesperson of the south corporation said, “We have acted against 1,418 construction   and 312 construction material violations in the last one year.”
 
 NGT had ordered in 2015 that every builder and owner will have to cover construction sites using tarpaulin or plastic sheets to prevent construction dust from spreading into neighboring areas. The order was passed to ensure compliance of the environment ministry’s construction guidelines.
 
 “People should sprinkle water especially during stone grinding and cover the construction material to control dust. In case of heavy construction sites, provision of soundproofing also needs to be in place. The whole site needs scaffolding,” said an official from the engineering department of north corporation. As per the NGT orders of April 2015, builders are expected not to store construction materials like sand and cement on road. Transportation of construction material without a cover invites a fine of Rs 5,000 and failure to control dust can invite a fine of Rs 50,000.
