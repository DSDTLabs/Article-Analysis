AMRITSAR: Sikhs in France are heaving a sigh of relief after   was elected President over far right leader Marine Le Pen. "The popular sentiments of minority communities of France, especially Sikhs, were with Macron since we were fearful of a ban on religious symbols in Le Pen's France," said the president of   while talking to TOI on Monday. 

 He said the life of minorities in France would have been difficult if Le Pen was elected President due to her extreme views on public display of religious symbols. Welcoming Macron, chairman of UK-based   Amrik   said that, "We have been in regular contact with Sikhs in France and understand that the President's political position on many issues could result in beterment for the small minority Sikh community in France in terms of religious freedom."
 
 Macron ran the election under the banner of En Marche!, a political movement he founded just over a year ago in April 2016. At 39, he will become the youngest President in the French history and the youngest head of state since Napoleon.
 
 The president of Dashmesh Sikh Academy, Paris, Rajbir Singh, said that there was much relief for the Sikhs in France as many had made up their mind to leave if Le Pen was elected since they would have been barred from wearing turban. "Macron is clearly much better for the Sikh community than Marine Le Pen," said Amrik.
