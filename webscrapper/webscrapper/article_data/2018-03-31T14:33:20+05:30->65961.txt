 Talking about the comic series returning this year C. B. Cebulski, Editor in Chief of Marvel, told The New York Times in an interview that they were waiting for the right time and the right team to bring the Fantastic Four team back to the audience.
 
 The author of this season Dan Scott said that the Fantastic Four were present in the first comic series he ever read. During the 1965 series, the creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had made the foursome meet the cosmic entity Galactus in an episode. “I started my adventures in the Marvel Universe with a freaked-out Reed Richards, the Watcher, and the Silver Surfer... I’ve wanted this for so long,” he said.
 
 Scott will mark his 10 years as an author with the Spider-Man team this summer. He foretells writing at least 55 issues with The Fantastic Four team leading the team to the 700th issue since the beginning of the series.   will have its 700th issue in the markets by April this year, followed by the release of new No. 1 authored by Ta-Nehisi Coates.
 
 While Sara Pichelli said in an email interview to The New York Times, “I can’t wait to draw a lot of the characters, but there’s one in particular I can’t reveal yet... You will know why they’re my favorite when you read the book!”
