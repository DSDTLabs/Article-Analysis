Denying reports that the four heroes handpicked their characters, Sudhir said it was director Sriram Aditya who had decided on the casting. Elaborating on his character in the film, he said, “I play the role of a youth who has lost his mother. In real life, my mother has brought me up with a lot of love and affection. However, she herself had lost her mom at a very tender age and did not get to experience a mother’s love. Having done this character, I can now actually relate to what she must have gone through.”
