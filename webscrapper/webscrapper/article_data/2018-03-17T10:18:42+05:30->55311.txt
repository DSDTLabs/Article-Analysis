VADODARA: The opposition parties led by   in the   (VMC) on Friday targeted the state government and the civic body – both ruled by the   – over the shortfall in octroi grant. The grant is paid to the civic bodies in the state after octroi tax was abolished in 2007.

 The octroi grant due to a civic body is calculated on the basis of the collection of the city using historical data. In case of Vadodara it was decided that it would get a grant of around Rs 267crore for the financial year 2007-08 and this would be increased at a rate of 18.64% every year.
 
 According to VMC opposition, since the inception of the grant itself, the state government has failed to give the entire amount to the civic body. The ruling BJP maintains that the shortfall was taken care of by providing grants and aid for other projects.
 
 VMC opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava had raised the issue during the budget meeting of the civic body recently. Shrivastava said that the total shortfall since 2007 amounted to Rs 5,266 crore. He demanded that those VMC corporators who were now MLAs from the ruling BJP should raise the issue with the state government.
 
 Former VMC opposition leader Chirag Zaveri said that establishment expenses of the civic body as well as operations and management of various infrastructure could be taken care of from this grant. He added that with specific grants for projects, the civic body could only erect projects and not maintain them.
 
 Zaveri has written a letter to the chief minister asking him to increase the grant for the VMC. “Otherwise we will land in a financial drought,” he said.
