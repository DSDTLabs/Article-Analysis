Mammootty's next film 'Uncle' will be in theaters on April 27 and recently, it's teasers gave a good enough look into the movie's premise. It looks like with some stunning visuals, the film also has some soul-soother songs.

  Recently, the movie's song 'Eeran Maarum,' composed by melody maker Bijibal was released on social media. As usual, the song is a treat in Shreya's honey- soaked voice and she evokes the peaceful atmosphere within a forest, just as in the song 'Akaleyoru Kaadinte,' from the film 'Ramante Edenthottam.' Karthika's character is shown as going on a trip to a forest in  's company, and enjoying every bit of it, in the visual of the song.
 
 The song is written by Rafeeque Ahammed and the movie is directed by Gireesh Damodar.
