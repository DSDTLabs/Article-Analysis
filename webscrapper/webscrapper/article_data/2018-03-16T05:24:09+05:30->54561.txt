MUMBAI: Doctors at   in   performed a complex five-hour-long surgery to save the life of a 33-year-old labourer from Nashik, who was impaled by a 4ft long iron rod that pierced his torso while working at a construction site. With the rod-that entered his body through the groin, perforating his intestines, liver, abdomen and chest before coming out of the back- the man journeyed a 200km bumpy ride from Nashik to Mumbai in search of a hospital to remove it. 

 Sheikh's family could not make use of the state's decorated free ambulance scheme as they were not informed about it. His mother Naseem said they paid Rs 5,500 to hire a private ambulance to get him to Mumbai. "With great difficulty, we raised the money from his friends and coworkers, all daily wage labourers," she said. 
 
  On March 8, while working at a construction  , Sheikh slipped and fell from a height of 7ft on an iron rod that was jutting out of concrete pillars. 
 
 He traversed 200km in over six hours in the ambulance, seething in pain. "The rod that was protruding at the back of his collar bone didn't allow him to lie evenly inside the ambulance. We bought an   and placed it between the rod and his head. But everytime, we would hit a pothole or a speedbreaker, he would scream in pain. He was in and out of consciousness and pleading us to save him," Naseem recollected with tears in her eyes.
