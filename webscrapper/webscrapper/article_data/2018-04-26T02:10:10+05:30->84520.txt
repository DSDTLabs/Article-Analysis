NEW DELHI: The   of purported  , commonly known as  , have struck in the national capital. A south Delhi-based   lost   to fraudsters who claimed to be dealing in the   that supposedly   a   to the one who possesses it.

 The crooks posed as representatives of an American firm ‘Rehan Metal USA’, which had opened a branch in Karol Bagh. The victim, Jaheed Ali (36), was introduced to these people through a tenant offering him the “Rs 5-crore worth precious metal” at a discount.
 
 Ali was told that the alloy was in high demand by atomic energy firms who would pay around Rs 10 crore for it. A member of the gang even posed as an atomic firm official and sought a deal with him for the metal.
 
 Convinced that it was a good deal, the victim sold a floor of his building and gave the crooks the money. The gang soon shut their office and disappeared. Ali then approached police and lodged a complaint.
 
 Sources said at least half a dozen people may have been conned of crores. A Lajpat Nagar-based businessman is learnt to have   around Rs 1 crore to crooks playing a similar trick. The incident occurred a few months ago. The businessman has filed a complaint with police, but no arrests have been made yet. 
 
 Crime Branch has been asked to take up these cases on priority. Arrests are likely by the end of the week, an officer said.
 
 The gang is very organised. While two-three people pose as sellers, a member at times poses as another potential buyer and tries to compete with the target to inflate prices. The crooks tell their targets that the machine on sale is made of precious materials and possesses enormous atomic power, which is sought by space organisations like NASA and ISRO.
 
 The victims are made to believe that they can sell the metal later for several crores in the international market. They are also told that the rice pullers attract rare earth metals from the spot where a thunderbolt strikes.
