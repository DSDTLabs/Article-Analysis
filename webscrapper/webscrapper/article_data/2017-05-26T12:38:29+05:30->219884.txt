DHARWAD: It is the Bennehalla, a tributary of the Malaprabha flowing across Haveri, Dharwad and Gadag districts, that causes devastation during monsoons in the event of excessive rainfall. The overflowing stream results in submergence of roads, agricultural lands and residential areas, and villagers living alongside the 160km Bennehalla stretch are under constant fear of   during the monsoon. 

  As of now, the situation is normal as there hasn't been much rain in the catchment area. However, the IMD's prediction of heavy rain in the days to come has created fear among the residents of villages that get affected by flash floods in the Bennehalla. Claims by successive governments of formulating plans to streamline the flow by desilting the stream and removing obstacles have not been actually implemented. 
 
 The people of Mullahalli, Yaraguppi, Hanchinala, Holemannur, Gadagoli, Amargol, Kuruvinakoppa, Menasagi, Hole Alur, Holehadagali, BS Beleri, Basarkod, Kurlageri, Budihal and   in Ron and Nargund taluks are living in fear, but they seem to be resigned to their fate.
 
 At least six or seven villages get cut off for long periods when the entrance of Gudisagar village in Navalgund taluk is submerged. Connectivity to Sotakanal, Kadadalli and Arahatti is cut off, and boats have to be pressed into service to ferry villagers. The government has appointed an expert committee headed by former chief engineer   to suggest measures to improve its course; the committee made certain recommendations in 2000 and 2013 which have not been implemented.
