Recently a local wing of the government witnessed a rise in the felling down of trees in its locality. Chopping down of trees is a major negative and is frowned upon by everyone and to take in charge of the issue, the local wing conducted a   drive. It was under the supervision of   to make the area clean, green and beautiful. They gathered in large numbers to plant trees like 
  and rain tree saplings. This was done before the upcoming   season and that the saplings will get ample water during the season. Dignitaries like S. V. Miskhin, S. V. Topkar, D.M. Hukkeri etc. were present to support the cause.
