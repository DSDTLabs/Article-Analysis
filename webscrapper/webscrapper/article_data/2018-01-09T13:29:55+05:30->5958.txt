MADURAI: A contempt case has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court stating that the district collector of   and chief engineer (state ground and surface water resource data centre) had failed to obey a court order directing to look into an issue of illegal extraction of ground water for commercial purpose in   island.

 The petition filed by secretary of Ramanathapuram district consumer right protection association, J   came up for hearing before the division bench. The petitioner said that he took up the issue with the authorities by sending representations in November 2016 and January 2017. As there was no action on it, he took the issue to the high court bench last year. The division bench on June 20 last year directed the collector and chief engineer to look into the representations in one month and take appropriate action. 
 
 Following it, when the petitioner went to the officials, the chief engineer passed an order on July 18 last year stating that no permission was given to take ground water for commercial purpose and that it is revenue divisional officer who is responsible for taking against the people who were drawing water. It would make it clear that the people who are taking ground water at present, are unauthorised people. 
 
 In Rameswaram, drinking water is available in a limited places which too has become saline. The collector who is supposed to act, also failed to take action. 
 
 Besides, the   ( ) Act, 2003 was repealed in 2013 to enact a better law, but no rule or regulation had been framed so far in that regard. The action of the officials were wilful disobedience of the court, which deserved contempt proceedings, the petitioner said.
