TRICHY: Government Railway Police (GRP) in   has launched a special team named as â€˜Udhayam Volunteers' comprising of sweepers, catering staff and auto drivers numbering 75, to rescue the children who are found at the station and its premises, after landing from various places.

 Since the GRP is struggling to execute many works amid staff crunch, the new team has been formed here in Trichy junction after the same was successfully launched in Chennai recently. Superintendent of police for GRP Z   handed over the ID cards to the volunteers of the team, who are entrusted the responsibility of rescuing children who wander in the railway station. 
 
 Several lost and abandoned children are found wandering aimlessly among the sea of commuters in railway stations. Exploitation, sexual and physical abuse and trafficking are just some of the things that these unaccompanied children can fall prey to. In order to avert any such circumstances, GRP has been taking various measures in Trichy railway division which is spread across 16 districts, officials said. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Annie Vijaya said that around 1,000 children have been rescued so far in Trichy railway division. The volunteers would inform GRP if they notice any children, based on suspicion. The volunteers have been imparted with a brief training session, she said.
