GURUGRAM: The Manesar-Kundli stretch of Kundli-Manesar-Palwal ( )   will be thrown open to traffic within a month and a half and will be inaugurated by PM  , said chief minister   on Thursday, adding that the project was delayed owing to ongoing litigations.

 
  
  
 
 
 “We have constituted a separate authority for the KMP Expressway. It will develop areas along the road,” he said. Nearly 30% of the e-way stretch is still incomplete.
 
 Asked if it would be possible to complete the Kundli-Manesar portion of the expressway in one and a half months, sources in the Haryana State Industry and Infrastructure Development Corporation ( ) told   meeting this deadline would be extremely difficult. 
 
 “Though we have received the government’s order to complete the project by June-end, it seems quite unlikely to finish the road construction before July-end,” said an official on condition of anonymity.
 
 The state government had set multiple deadlines to complete the Kundli-Manesar stretch, the most recent one being March 31. When completed, the road will traverse through several districts, including Sonipat, Jhajjat, Mewat and Palwal.a
 
 The total distance of the expressway is 135.6 kilometres. The stretch between Kundli and Manesar is around 83km long. The Manesar-Palwal stretch was inaugurated by Union minister Gadkari last year after a delay of over 10 years.
 
 The expressway cuts across four national highways — NH-1, NH-2, NH-8 and NH-10. There are 52 underpasses and 23 overpasses in this project. Additionally, there are 31 proposed cattle crossings, along with four railway over-bridges, 18 big/small bridges and two parking areas for trucks. In July 2015, a sub-committee headed by CM Khattar had approved the second phase between Kundli and Manesar.
