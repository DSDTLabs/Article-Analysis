PUNE: The Pune rural police have ordered an inquiry against two constables after a social activist alleged they were under the influence of liquor while driving a police SUV on the   bridge, which links the   bypass with the   expressway, around 7pm on March 30. 

 A video clip, which went viral on social media on Monday, shows the activist,  , holding up the white-coloured SUV and telling the two constables - one in the driver's seat and the other sitting next to him - not to drive when drunk.
 
 In the clip, the constable in the driver's seat is seen repeatedly pleading for pardon and promising Malkhare that he won't drink again. A police constable from the   police station had to be summoned to the spot to drive the vehicle, along with the two constables, to the police station.
 
 Pune rural's additional superintendent of police Tejaswini Satpute, who is monitoring the inquiry, told TOI, "The inquiry is being conducted by the sub-divisional police officer of the Dehu Road division. The two constables have not been suspended yet. Action will be taken on the basis of the inquiry report."
