GURUGRAM: A   and a team of forensic experts on Saturday morning reached   to probe into the murder of seven- year-old boy Pradhyumn.

 DSP L K Jaiswal was heading the probe. While, Gurugram SHO was also present on the spot.
 
 The Haryana government on Tuesday officially recommended a CBI investigation into the murder of Ryan International School student Pradhyumn Thakur. The move came after the boy's father Barun criticised the delay since the CM had made the announcement four days ago.
 
 An FIR was being registered in the matter on Friday. A team with forensic experts is supposed to visit the school soon to take statements of Pradhyumn's parents.
 
 Sources say that the agency will also take over all the case related files from Gurugram police and custody of main suspect - school bus conductor Ashok Kumar, who was arrested on September 8.
 
  
  
 
 Police has claimed that Kumar had tried to sexually assault the boy and murdered him with a knife when he resisted. Pradhyumn was in the washroom for just three minutes before he was murdered, police said.
 
 Police has also added Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act for security lapses by the school and arrested two senior Ryan officials - its north India head Francis Thomas and HR head Jayesh Thomas, in its murder FIR.
 
  
  
 
 The CBI, according to the procedure, re-registers a state FIR first and if more charges are established during investigation, those are informed to the court in the chargesheet.
