KOLHAPUR: Environmental activists have slammed the civic body for announcing that waste will be shifted from the   dumping site to the Takala landfill site without setting up a waste segregation unit.

 According to guidelines of the pollution control rules, the   (KMC) can’t dump waste piled up at the Kasba Bawda site to Takala as it needs to be segregated properly. Apart from fresh waste or waste high moisture content, the KMC can only dump waste that is chemically inert. The KMC has developed a landfill site at a quarry. An activist said that the quarry is a source of water and the dumping of fresh waste may lead to pollution of underground water.
 
 Durgesh Lingras, a Rajarampuri-based activist, said, “The KMC will dump the whole waste from the Kasba Bawda site. Officials have said that the waste contains 20% to 25% inert material. But, the KMC has not undertaken any study to decide on the quantum of inert material in the piled-up waste. We want the KMC to appoint scientists from the   or   to decide the inert material from the waste and its amount before shifting it to the landfill site.”
 
 At present, over 5 lakh tonne of waste has piled up at Kasba Bawda site over the last five years. The KMC does not have space to dump the waste and has undertaken the work to develop a landfill site at Takala and near Bawda’s sugar mill. Civic officials have claimed that the work on the Takala landfill site is complete. But, activists have raised concerns regarding the absence of effective measures to tackle the menace of leachate, which is the dark fluid oozing out of the waste with harmful chemicals in it.
 
 “The cost of transporting the waste is high. The civic body does not have any weighing facility set up at the landfill site which is mandatory according to the rules of  . Also, there is a need to develop a facility to address incidents of fire. We want the KMC to appoint an environmental engineer to monitor the capping of the landfill site,” Lingras said.
