 An incident that is sure to have taught an   a lesson he is not going to forget in a hurry has emerged from Chikkaberagi village of Raichur district when a girl used a knife to put an end to his harassment.
 
 Anupriya, the girl from Chikkaberagi, who   every day for her studies, was fed up with the eve teaser identified as  , a resident of  , who had been following and   her for over six months.
 
 The miscreant would follow her every day to and from her degree college in Sindhanur taluk and pester her to reciprocate to his advances, against which the girl warned him repeatedly.
 
 When his acts became brazen and he started harassing her in front of other girls of her college, Anupriya decided that she had to do something about it, which would end her miseries.
 
 She carried a knife in her purse and threatened to stab the eve teaser with it when he approached her again. Undeterred, the youth continued his wayward behaviour and on Thursday, when she would not put up with it anymore Anupriya pulled the knife on him.
 
 This too did not have the desired effect on the youth prompting the brave girl to chase him around the Sindhanur bus stand, knife in hand.
 
 Her desperate action attracted the attention of other people at the bus stand who understood what was happening. They gave chase to the miscreant, caught hold of him and beat him black and blue, before he made good his escape from the place.
 
 A relieved Aunpriya left for her home, but not before lodging a complaint at the Sindhanur police station. After initial investigation, when the police arrived at Devarajuâ€™s house, they realised the event at the bus stand had scared him off his home too. They are now looking for him.
