MUMBAI: A major fire broke out in a ground-plus-three-storey structure in the congested   area in south Mumbai early on Friday. There were no casualties, said a fire official.

 Around 2am, the fire brigade got an alert of the fire in building number 91, a residential-cum-commercial structure, on Nagdevi Street. All residents rushed out to safety before it spread. 
 
 The fire gutted the second and third floors and the middle portion of the building caved in during  . The flames were doused after five hours.
 
 Officials said they faced difficulty during firefighting operations as the building is in a congested lane. Electric cables hanging dangerously between two buildings were another hurdle, they added. 
 
 In 2015, a major fire broke out in   building in Kalbadevi. Four fire officers, including then fire brigade chief Sunil Nesarikar, died after a portion of the building collapsed on them during firefighting operations.
