Taapsee Pannu, who will be seen as a spy in the 'Baby' spin-off, ' ', reveals that playing a negative role is part of her bucket list.

 The actress, who earned critical acclaim for her performance in last year’s 'Pink' says, “I want to play a character with shades of grey. I sometimes think maybe, filmmakers don’t consider me for such a role because of my face, which might not fit the bill. However, the challenge lies therein, when you cast someone against the grain. I’d love to play Rosamund Pike’s character from the film 'Gone Girl'. Her demeanour belies her true intentions. The psycho-trippy character is something I really want to portray. I’ve told   (Sircar) and   (Pandey) to cast me in a role like that.”
