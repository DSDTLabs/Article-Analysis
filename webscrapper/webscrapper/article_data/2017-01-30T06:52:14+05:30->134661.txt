 The number of children found on the platforms was 219, including 65 girls, in 2015.
 
 Senior inspector   said the 274 boys and 48 girls were between the ages of one day and 18 years. “It is very difficult to reunite a child with his parents if the child is below two years of age as they are too young to communicate,” he said.
 
 However, police make all the efforts to reunite the children with their parents. “We are still looking for the parents of 64 children who have been now admitted into different government-run observation homes,” Satav said.
 
 Similarly, in 2015, police successfully reunited 174 kids with their parents the rest of the children were also admitted into observation homes.
 
 According to the police, a majority of the children between the ages of 14 and 18, usually flee from their homes after a fight with their relatives or parents. The children in this age group usually remember details about their home or city. Thus, it becomes easy for the police to reunite them with their parents.
 
 Many children also run away from home after performing poorly in examinations. Some flee if their step-father or step-mother abuses them.
 
 Satav said, “It is possible to reunite these children only if there is a missing complaint registered somewhere in the state,” he said
