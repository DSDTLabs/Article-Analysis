NEW DELHI: The   on Monday reserved its verdict on petitions seeking restoration of the stringency of Section 498A of IPC which provides for arrest of the husband and his relatives on the complaint of a wife alleging cruelty meted out to her because of dowry.

 
 Appearing for petitioners, senior advocates   and   faulted the SC’s July 27, 2017, judgment by a two-judge bench in diluting the arrest provision and said the IPC provision was enacted to protect women from ill-treatment at her matrimonial home by husbands and inlaws as the legislature believed that dowry had a chilling effect on the institution of marriage.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y   said it agreed with the petitioners’ plea that the two-judge bench’s decision to dilute the stringency of Section 498A did not co-relate with the situation presented by the petition.
 
 However, it clarified that if protection of women in matrimonial homes was needed through a stringent provision, at the same time, one could not lose sight of possible abuse of the section to violate the liberty of the husband and his relatives.
