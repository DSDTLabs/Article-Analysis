 CHANDIGARH : For the past 12 days,   in the   have not received any water. The units now depend upon tankers for the supply.
 
 
 During a visit to the Industrial Area Phase I, a TOI team found plots 136-140/1 to 136-140/99 without water. The owners said more than a week, their day started with complaining to the   and receiving empty assurances. Plots 220 to 709 get   at low pressure. A   said it was his daily routine to call a private water tanker for up to Rs 600. The workers of this factory cannot use their kitchens and toilets because of the unavailability of water. Tired of filing complaint after complaint, the people continue to wait for appropriate measures by the government authorities. The situation has worsened to the point where many factories do not have even a drop of water.
 
  
 Surinder Kumar, a factory owner, said: “The water supply to my unit has always been irregular and at low pressure. The MC does a check-up after multiple complaints and then release water for that day alone. It has no permanent solution.” Factory worker Amar Rai said: “Factory owners, may or may not call for water tanker. In case they don’t, we have to borrow water from nearby units or fetch it from the residential area.” Devinder Singh, a factory worker who has to fetch drinking water from a nearby colony, said: “Sometime the companies that have called the tankers decline to share water.”
