NAVI MUMBAI: The clubbing of few   of Nerul with Belapur node in the online   portal has been posing a major problem for residents. Sectors 19, 19A and 26 of Nerul have been included in Belapur ward in the online portal.

 Since February, activists have been complaining about not finding few sectors of Nerul ward on the portal. “What is the logic behind including Nerul sector into Belapur? This change has been defeating the purpose of the online grievance system as now there is no accountability,” said Nerul resident and activist  . 
 
 There has been no action on at least three complaints, including that on unauthorised parking and encroachment by a Gurudwara, due to ward offices passing the buck, the   said. 
 
 An official from the IT department said the sector bifurcation has not been the cause of trouble. However, failure of ward offices in being able to resolve complaints will be brought to the notice of the higher authorities, he said. 
 
 “Sector bifurcation is as per the plan. Ward offices are required to provide appropriate resolution and failing to do so will be brought to the notice of the authorities notice.”
