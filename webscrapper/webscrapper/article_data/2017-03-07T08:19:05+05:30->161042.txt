GANDHINAGAR: The state government claimed that since the killing of the dalit sarpanch of Varsarda village in Amreli district, the state government has formed   and ST cells in 33 districts and four police commissionerates.

 Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja, during the discussion on the Varsarda murder, told the house that the government had also implemented the new atrocity rules passed by the Union government in 2015.
 
 Reacting to allegations that the atrocities on dalits were rising in the state during   rule, Jadeja said that the murder of dalits in Gujarat had declined by 32% in 2015 from the previous year. 
 
 “Against 25 murders of dalit persons registered in 2014, only 17 such cases were registered in 2015. Of the 707 cases related to the murders of dalits registered across the country in 2015, only 17 were in Gujarat. That is only 2.40%,” Jadeja said.
 
 “Of the 45,003 cases registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act across India in 2015, only 1,046 cases were registered in Gujarat. That is only 2.32% of total cases,” Jadeja added.
 
  Shailesh Parmar, who moved the motion for discussion, alleged that atrocities on the dalit community in Gujarat rose following the Una flogging incident last year.
 
 Jadeja further said that Jaysukh Madhad, the dalit sarpanch of Varsarda village, was allegedly killed by three men from the same village on February 28 over political enmity and a grudge against Madhad, who had been elected sarpanch of that village in the 2016 panchayat election. 
 
 The minister told the house that all the three accused were arrested within three days and sent to jail by local police.
 
 “The family of the victim was given compensation of Rs 4,30,500 by the government,” he said. The BJP minister, however, chose to remain silent on the demand for a government job to next of kin of the slain sarpanch.
