AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Monday granted bail to two police constables from Amreli district in connection with the controversial Rs 12 crore bitcoin extortion case from builder Shailesh Bhatt of Surat. Babubhai   and Vijaybhai Vadher were ordered to be released from jail upon several conditions. 

 Both constables were arrested earlier this month along with advocate Ketan Patel of Surat, whose bail application the court heard on Monday. A decision on Patel’s bail plea is expected on Tuesday.
 
 While opposing Patel’s bail plea, the probe agency cited several witnesses including victim Bhatt’s business partner Kirit  , whose behaviour in the incident was seen as suspicious. Two hundred bitcoins were allegedly transferred by the accused cops from Paladiya’s digital wallet. 
 
 The probe agency has cited Paladiya as an important witness and submitted that when the incident had taken place, Paladiya was sitting with the victim in his car. The accused cops took him along with the victim to   farm near Magodi village. tnn
