JAIPUR: The   ( ) in yet another letter has reminded to the   ( ) to deposit the remaining fire cess amount collected by the residents. 

 The JMC has expressed it helplessness in strengthening the fire wing due to paucity of funds.
 
 In a recent meeting chaired by the urban development and housing (UDH) minister  , the proposal of transferring the fire cess collected by the JDA to the JMC was given approval. Following this, Rs 10 crore was transferred to JMC, out of total collected amount Rs 60 crore. The JMC has now demanded its remaining Rs 50 crore. 
 
 The cash-strapped JMC in past also had written a letter to the JDA to transfer the cess. According to sources, in five years the JDA collected nearly Rs 60 crore from the plot owners.
 
 In present scenario, the JDA is levying Rs 100 per sq metre fire cess on building constructed above 15 feet to 40 feet.
 
 In absence of funds, the JMC has failed to strengthen its fire department wing. At present, there are 11 fire stations having 50 fire tenders in the state capital. However, as the city is expanding and its population is increasing, the existing infrastructure is not sufficient to cater the city’s requirement.
 
 “As per National Building Code Of India, one fire tender should be deployed on population of 40,000 people. There is requirement of minimum 30 more fire tenders. Also, city should have at least 15 fire stations,” said a fire department official.
 
 The city’s fire department is also not equipped to douse the fire in high -rise buildings. Sources at JMC said, “There is only only snorkel ladder with department which can douse fire up to the height of 44 meters. As maps of 65 meter buildings are approved, the fire wing should have fire- tenders that can reach up to the height of 70 metre.”
