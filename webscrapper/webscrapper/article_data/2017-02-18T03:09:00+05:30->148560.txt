THANE:   on Friday said the   has been piggy-back riding on the popularity of the   for the last 25 years and in spite of their lack of performance and charisma enjoyed positions of power in the corporations.

 Firing at a fussilade at its one-time ally, Thackeray suggested that the BJP was most ungrateful as it exploited the support of the Sena to corner key positions of power in the corporation, which would have otherwise been just a dream had they contested the   on their own.
 
  “Wherever the Sena came to power and took over as city mayor, the chair of the deputy mayor was shared with BJP. Could the BJP have ever got anything on its own in   over the last few years,” Thackeary said.
 
 He also called the BJP as a party of liars pointing to the pre-poll promise by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis during the polls to the Kalyan-Dombivli municipal corporation last year.
 
 Uddhav demanded to know if the CM has delivered on his promise to gift Rs 6,500 crores to the KDMC for infrastructure development and also raised the issue of the 27 villages, bordering the KDMC boundary, which the CM had then promised to exclude from the KDMC jurisdiction and to have a special planning body for their overall development.
 
 He added that promises made by the BJP-led Central government on demonitisation have failed. 
 
 “I have been affected by the demonetization also. The common man suffered immensely,” he said.
 
 He also questioned the chief minister’s remarks towards corruption allegations in the TMC pointing towards the closeness of the chief minister and the civic commissioner. “If the commissioner can call the CM at late in the night, it just shows their proximity. It is the CM who appoints the civic chief in every corporation,” said Uddhav.
 
 Uddhav also drew the attention of the administration towards the violations of poll code of conduct.
