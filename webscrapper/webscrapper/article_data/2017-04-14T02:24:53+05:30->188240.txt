GURUGRAM: The   (RTA) has collected a whopping Rs 1.5 crore till Wednesday in the form of motor vehicle (MV) tax since April 1.

  However, after the cabbies and other transporters cribbed over the long queues and the ordeal of parking the vehicle on the highway in order to pay the tax, the transport department has now offered online payment option, to save the time and effort of the tax payers. The tax is being collected from three counters at Sirhaul border.
 
 “We have already collected more than Rs 1.50 crore as  . The per day tax includes both road tax, as well as the motor tax for goods and passenger vehicles,” said Trilok Chand, secretary, RTA.
 
  Earlier, the road tax was paid at the RTA office, while the motor tax for goods and passenger vehicles had to be paid to the excise department. But, a majority of cab owners never used to pay the motor tax, leading to revenue losses for the state government. Now, a clearance has to be sought from the excise department for the dues paid till March 31.
 
 The cabbies and other commercial vehicle owners have raised the issue of how the vehicles are parked on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway in the scorching heat, while the drivers stand in queues to pay the tax at the RTA counters at the Delhi-Gurgaon border. 
 
 Now, the tax can be paid through the state transport department website (https://haryanatransport.gov.in). In fact, the department intends to eventually digitise the system and payments can only be made through online transactions.
 
 “We are informing all the drivers that they also have the option to pay online. But most of them say that they won’t use the digital medium to pay just Rs 100 every day. We plan to close down these counters after a few weeks,” added Chand.
