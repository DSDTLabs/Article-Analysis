 Following complaints by locals on issues affecting them due to unauthorized shack operations, Azgaonkar said, “I will not tolerate this defiance of the shack operators, as well as the dereliction of duty by the department in not clamping down on the same. I have directed the department of tourism to act immediately against any such violation of norms under the shack policy.”
 
 “I will look into the complaints and issues raised by locals in the north Goa coastal stretch and will move for action against the offenders and also against the department staff for failing to nip the issues at the right time,” he said.
 
 Azgaonkar said that strict monitoring of tourism activities would take place not only in the north coastal areas but along the entire coastal stretch.
