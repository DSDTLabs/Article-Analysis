Vijayawada: In a bid to facilitate the students attending Intermediate and SSC public examinations, officials of R&B are allowing two-wheelers from Prakasam Barrage to Kummaripalem junction from Tuesday, despite Kanakadurga   construction works. 

 The officials have removed the barricades from the construction site, saying that works will continue in other stretches. Residents of Gollapudi, Bhavanipuram who are facing severe problems due to traffic diversions continued their agitations, demanding the officials to permit two-wheelers so that they can reach the city in short time. 
 
 Congress party also staged an agitation in the city with the same demand and a few agitators were arrested too. 
 
 Chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu directed the Krishna district administration and the officials of roads and buildings to allow two-wheelers through this way. Legislative council chief whip Buddha Venkateswara Rao ( Buddha Venkanna) requested the district collector to allow vehicular movement on this way so that students can reach the examination centres on time. 
 
 “Students who are writing examinations will find it difficult to travel in the diverted roads and may reach the examination centres late. So, we have spoken to some higher rank officials about the matter and the barricades have been removed finally to allow two-wheelers,” said Buddha Venkanna.
 
 The denizens of the area are happy with the decision. 
 
 “The government has finally identified our problems. It took almost 45 minutes to reach Kaleswara Rao market due to the traffic diversions and we are spending hours in traffic. 
 
 It will take months for the completion of the flyover works that are progressing at a slow pace,” said G. Venkata Naresh,of Gollapudi.
