TUTICORIN: The famous weekly   goat shandy near   in Tuticorin district witnessed sale of more than 6 crore on Saturday. About 7,000 goats and sheep were brought and more than 6,000 were sold. People manning the shandy said usually on a Saturday 1,000 to 1,500 sheep and goats were brought and business would be around 60 lakh. 

 The Saturdays before   and   witness peak business. Pongal business is the best in the year as farmers sell their goats and sheep. On the other hand, many people don't buy goats and sheep prior to Pongal due to spiritual reasons, including the Makaravilakku season for the trip to the Ayyappan temple at Sabarimala in Kerala. They start consuming non-vegetarian food after Pongal.
 
 "That is why the day after Pongal is called kari naal (non-veg day)," said  , 46 of Pudur, who was happy he sold all 20 goats he brought. 
 
 He recalled that during Pongal last year they had very poor business due to demonetisation and drought. "We suffered without fodder for goats and could not sell them as well," he said. tnn
