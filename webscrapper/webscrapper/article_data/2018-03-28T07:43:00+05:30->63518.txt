Ludhiana: The Daba police have booked a 19-year-old boy — who solemnized his marriage with a 19-year-old girl against the will of their parents — under the Child Marriage Protection Act. The matter got highlighted when the girl filed a petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court for protection. The court identified the boy’s age as ineligible for marriage, after which it ordered an investigation. Following the investigation, Daba police booked the boy under Section 10 of the Child Marriage Protection Act, 2006, on Monday.

 According to information, Vishal Sharma (19) of Basant Nagar in Daba solemnised his marriage with a 19-year-old girl from Fauji Mohalla here at Mansa Devi Mandir in Panchkula on January 7, against the will of their parents. Later, the girl filed a petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court for protection. In the petition, the girl mentioned her date of birth as May 10, 1999, and Vishal’s date of birth as January 2, 1999. The court found that the boy had not attained the marriageable age of 21 years, so it ordered the police to probe the matter and find documents related to the boy’s age. The girl later withdrew her petition.
 
 Daba police station SHO, inspector Gurbinder Singh, said the police approached the boy’s school, but did not find any document of age proof in its records. The police also checked records of the Municipal Corporation, but could not find the boy’s birth certificate. Further, the police also called on the boy’s house and told his parents to ask their son to undergo an ossification test, but the boy did not turn up for it. Later, when they again called on his house, it was found locked.
 
 The official added that the court, in its order, pronounced that according to the date of birth mentioned by the boy and the girl, the boy had not attained marriageable age. Following court orders, the police lodged an FIR.
