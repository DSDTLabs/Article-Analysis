NEW DELHI: The   (CoA) on Saturday reminded   that the innings of some board officials would be over when the newly-drafted constitution is approved by the Supreme Court. In a strongly worded letter to BCCI office-bearers,   informed them that a panel like the finance committee won't exist post the adoption of the draft constitution.

 Last Thursday, finance committee chairman   had stormed out of the meeting questioning how an important committee had been reduced to a rubber stamp with the CoA making all policy decisions. The CoA retaliated by writing back: â€œPlease note that the finance committee (as also various other committees) do not find mention in the list of committees included in the draft BCCI Constitution that is in line with the recommendations of the Hon'ble Justice   (as accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court). 
 
 Accordingly, the above position will continue only until the new BCCI Constitution as per the reforms mandated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is adopted.
 
 The CoA also pointed out that the final decision on money matters has always been taken by the office bearers and the finance committee only debated on issues, made notes and gave its opinion.
