THANE: The   facility that was inaugurated amid much fanfare three months ago at Thane station premises has been   down.

 The railways said that the tenure of the earlier   for the pay-and-park system, adjoining platform number one had expired last month but no fresh bidder has approached the railways citing the operating terms to be financially unviable. 
 
 Due to this, nearly 300 motorists who used to park at the facility have been left in the lurch since Friday, said officials. 
 
 “The earlier contractor was assigned a temporary period to operate the facility till a full time deal was inked. No one approached the railways, after which they asked the earlier contractor to continue with the service. However, he refused to operate and also alerted motorists about the same on Thursday,” said an official. 
 
 A senior commercial officer said that they were mulling to allow the facility to be kept free for motorists till a new contractor was finalised. 
 
 Meanwhile, commuters said that they are facing a lot of problems because of this. “The busy station needs a proper parking facility. If its not pay and park then there is fear of people playing some mischief. So, we would prefer to park our vehicle on the road,’’ said a commuter.
 
 The monthly pass system was started last month at a cost of Rs 400 as against the daily charge which is Rs 30 per hour up to 12 hours, amounting to Rs 900. The parking facility which began in June can accommodate around 1000 two-wheelers.
