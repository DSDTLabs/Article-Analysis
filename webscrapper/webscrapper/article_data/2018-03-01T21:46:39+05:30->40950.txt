The news came out today morning and the country's seeing a restless and tragic day today. It is being reported that the actress died of a sudden   and the report has been confirmed by her brother-in-law. That's the thing with sudden deaths: they are least expected and the most tragic. 
 
 Sudden cardiac arrests are deadly because of this very reason. So, what exactly is a cardiac arrest? What are its signs and symptoms? Are there any early signs you can watch out for? We tell you.
 
 
 
 
 
 A sudden cardiac arrest is an unexpected and a very sudden and abrupt loss of the function of the heart, breathing as well as consciousness. It happens due to a sudden disturbance to the functioning of the heart which leads to disruption in pumping of the blood. As a result, blood supply to the body is cut off. Sudden cardiac arrest needs immediate and prompt medical attention. If not given proper care, it can lead to sudden cardiac death. 
 
 
 
 There is a difference between sudden cardiac arrest and heart attack. In heart attack, blood flow is blocked in a portion of the heart and this injures the muscles. Sometimes, a heart attack can trigger a sudden cardiac arrest.
 
 
 
 None of the diseases comes unannounced. Every problem in the body gives us signs, however subtle they may be. However, when it comes to a sudden cardiac arrest, doctors often say that the attack may come completely out of the blue and not give any warning signs at all. But, much to our relief, a recent study established that even a sudden cardiac arrest has its warning indicators. Some common early symptoms include the following:
 
 - A dizziness that doesn't go away easily
 - A general sense of fatigue
 - Shortness of breath
 - Heart palpitations
 - Chest pain that may happen as early as four weeks before the cardiac arrest
 
 
 
 
 
 Heart attack and cardiac arrest symptoms are different in women and men, say studies. Though there are many symptoms that run common, there are various differences also that doctors have pointed out. They include:
 
 - Symptoms may be more subtle and more ambiguous
 - Chest pain may not be the primary pain and may be accompanied by nausea, fatigue, pain in back, neck and shoulders as well.
 - Tight artery blockages are not very common in women but they are in men
 - The reason behind these differences could be that women may develop preeclampsia, a problem of high blood pressure during pregnancy, in their lives. Also, menopause puts women at a higher risk of suffering from heart disease during that phase of their lives.
 
 
 
 There are many lifestyle risk factors that up your chances of a cardiac arrest. These include the following :
 
 - A problem of high blood pressure or hypertension
 - Diabetes
 - Smoking
 - High cholesterol levels
 - No or very less physical activity
 - Overweight or obesity
 
 
 
 In case of a sudden cardiac arrest, the patient must be immediately administered medical help. You should call a doctor as soon as possible. The administering of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can help or a doctor can also treat with a defibrillator. You may just give compressions to the chest if you have to wait for help to arrive. If proper steps are taken, survival is possible. 
 
 
 
 It is not just our legendary Sridevi who has died of a sudden cardiac arrest. There have been many other famous celebrities who died similarly. In fact, Mother Teresa also died of a cardiac arrest. Reema Lagoo, Aarthi Agarwal and Suchitra Sen are some other Indian actresses who died of cardiac arrest or heart attack.
