GHAZIABAD: The orderly crowd that gathered at Kamla Nehru Nagar in   for Narendra Modi’s election rally mostly came from rural areas and had vegetable biryani, samosas and laddoos to relish during their journey to the venue.

 “We were not paid anything in cash to attend the meeting. But we were given a 250gm packet each of vegetable biryani, samosas and laddoos during the journey,” said Girish (27), from Ghookna in Nandgram.
 
 An entire row at the venue was occupied by volunteers of the BJP’s IT cell. They claimed to be tweeting live feeds, photographs and videos apart from updating various official pages of the party on social media including Facebook.
 
 The volunteers, who were seated in an orderly fashion until Modi’s arrival, however, broke into impromptu songs and dances by climbing on chairs and desks as soon as his chopper appeared in the sky. They continued to chant ‘Modi’ ‘Modi’ all through his address at the meeting. A few volunteers distributed caps, stoles and insignias with party symbol free of cost at the venue which made it almost impossible to distinguish between organisers and general visitors.
