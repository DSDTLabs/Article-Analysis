 The childhood chums call it a ‘Freedom Ride’ as the daredevil act of crossing thousands of miles on their 42-year-old bike is the idea of true freedom for them. “Bike-riding represents freedom. Here you have the freedom to choose your own road and destination,” they say in one voice.

 During this critical hour in the country where we have issues for safety of our women, minorities and weaker sections of society and questions about priorities and paradigms of development, they believe that youth have to take responsibility and rise to the challenge of making bold choices that would contribute to the true progress of India. 
 
 During their journey they plan to interact with other youths and spread the message of peace and harmony. The plan to bypass hotels and inns, pitching their tents at roadside dhabas or petrol pumps to rest and recoup.
