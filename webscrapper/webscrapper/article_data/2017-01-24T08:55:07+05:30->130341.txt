AMRITSAR: The frenzied debate over the chief ministerial face of Congress in Punjab has triggered a controversy after posters billing former BJP MP   as a candidate for the top job surfaced in Amritsar.

 These posters have emerged in the past 48 hours. No one in the Congress has owned up to the posters, which were pasted on walls of school buildings, shops and other establishments.
 
 The posters come at a time when the party’s state chief, Captain Amarinder Singh’s, camp is waiting for an announcement from the Congress high command, making him the CM face.
 
 The   said no one has approached them so far with any complaint against the posters, which say, “Vote for Congress to make Sidhu CM.”
 
 Sidhu's close aide and personal assistant Bunny said they were not aware of the posters and suspected it to be an act of mischief. “This can be to create confusion,” said Bunny.
 
 Amarinder had skipped Sidhu's induction into the Congress last week in Delhi, but had welcomed him on Twitter and even spoken to him. He had even later called him as his “political son”.
 
 While Sidhu has already said he has left his future in Congress to “Rahul ji and Priyanka ji", Amarinder had told TOI that any decision on the ex-cricketer's role would be taken by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.
 
 In 2012, Congress had announced Amarinder as the CM candidate just five days before the assembly elections.
 
 Though Prashant Kishor’s firm IPAC has planned all its campaigns around Amarinder with events like Halke Vich Captain and Coffee With Captain, many in Congress say that the party is split over announcing him as CM candidate to stonewall any attacks from the SAD-BJP or AAP over his alleged Swiss bank account controversy. “Eventually, he will be the CM in case our party wins,” said a senior Congress leader.
