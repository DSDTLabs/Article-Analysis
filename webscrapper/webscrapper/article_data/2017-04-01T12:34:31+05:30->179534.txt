 has never looked leaner and fitter. The actress, who has constantly been written about for her weight, says, “Earlier, I was under the impression that I don’t have to control my diet if I exercise well. But now, I have realised that small changes in your diet go a long way. So, I have cut off junk food completely. ‘Kha ke workout kar lenge’ — this attitude doesn’t work. And of course, gymming, cardio, yoga and dancing also keep me fit.” She also feels that fitness has also changed the way she dresses. She elaborates, “As you grow fitter, you realise that you look and feel good a lot more. Clothes also fit well like never before.”
On the work front, ask her if commercial success has been eluding her lately, and she says, “I have achieved commercial success to last a lifetime. Now, I can pick and choose roles that will push me to my limits.” 
 The actress will be seen judging the show 'Nach Baliye'. Ask her what prompted her to judge the show after already judging a music reality show and she says, "I have always loved dancing. Shahid, Deepika are all great dancers. I will also dance to a couple of songs in the show. I enjoy doing non-fiction and feel that the reality shows on TV are really good.   will keep me on my toes. 
 So, is there any truth to the rumours that she is all set to tie the knot soon? “Marriage is not on the cards anytime soon. In fact, I don’t even know what kind of guy I’d like to get married to. Let people talk…log to kahenge…logon ka kaam hai kehna,” she sums up.
