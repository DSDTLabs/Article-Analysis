AMRITSAR: Chief of Beas-headquartered Dera Radha Saomi, Baba Gurinder Singh Dhillon, was flown to Singapore on Friday for medical treatment.

 A senior functionary of Dera, who didn’t want his name published, told TOI that Dhillon was not doing well for past several days. “Baba ji was touring and his condition deteriorated following. He was then admitted into a private hospital in Mohali,” he said, adding that he was flown to Singapore for further medical check-up.
 
 Dera has over 5,000 branches across India and its followers are spread over in 90 countries. The influence of Dera on state polity can be gauzed from the fact that almost all big political players in Punjab regularly visit the Dera in the run-up to the assembly elections, presumably eyeing its supporter base as vote bank.
 
 Ahead of elections,   vice-president Rahul Gandhi had spent a night in the Dera. Earlier, in November 2016, deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his brother-in-law minister Bikram Majithia had met the Dera chief in Mukatsar and Malout.
 
 In December 2016, Dhillon had visited Amritsar to attend the funeral ceremony of his 82-year-old relative Sukhla Seth who was murdered in her house along with her maid Manjit Kaur.
 
 Prior to that Dhillion was in news after he paid obeisance at Golden Temple in 2012, after jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Gurbachan Singh gave a clean chit to him in case of alleged demolition of a gurdwara at   village despite severe opposition by various Sikh groups.
 
 Another senior functionary at Dera, who also didn’t want to reveal his identity in media, said “Baba Ji has minor problem due to his hectic schedule and will be back soon hale and hearty.”
