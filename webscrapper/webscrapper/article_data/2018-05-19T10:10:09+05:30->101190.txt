Of late, several challenges have been doing the rounds on social media.   has started one of her own — a no-straw challenge that she has hashtagged #nostrawchallengebyshanvi.

 Shanvi tells us it all started when a friend challenged her to drink directly from a coconut. “I spilt the water the first few times and finally managed to drink it properly after 3-4 attempts. I then thought that this can be used for a good cause. Also, since figuring out how to drink directly from a coconut is fun, I felt that more people will be willing to try it. So, I uploaded a video of me drinking directly from a coconut and asked others to follow suit. The green cause is close to my heart. I am strictly against the use of plastic and often shout at people who throw plastic bottles on the road,” she says.
 
 
  
 Shanvi has extended the challenge to actors Vidisha Srivastava (who is also her sister), Asmita Sood, Aakansha Singh,  ,  ,  ,   and  , apart from her followers. Why did she choose these actors, we ask? “People tend to copy actors, so I hope that more people will shun straws and we can collectively reduce the amount of plastic that eventually finds its way into water bodies, killing fish and other aquatic animals,” says Shanvi.
