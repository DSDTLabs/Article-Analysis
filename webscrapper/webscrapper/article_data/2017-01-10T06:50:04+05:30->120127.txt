The statement is being seen as Mulayam's attempt to reassure Akhilesh's supporters, who have been apprehensive of a plot to dislodge him by not projecting him as the future face of the party. Observers said there was a need to take Mulayam's statement with caution in light of his recent flip-flops. Besides, if Akhilesh was wary of a possible resentment among Yadavs over the perceived humiliation of of his father, Mulayam's latest move seems to complicate matters for him. 

 On Sunday, talking to party workers at his   residence in New Delhi, Mulayam had said that Akhilesh was his son and "let him do what he wanted to".
 
  A little later he held a press conference to declare that he was the national president of the party and that the special convention held in Lucknow, where Akhilesh was anointed as the party chief, was unconstitutional.
