Pawan Kumar, GGM - Basin Manager, Cauvery,   ( ) tells Meera Vankipuram there will be no hydro-fracking at Neduvasal and that drilling will not affect the water table in the area since water consumption will be small. 

  
 Our studies/data indicates that in the area which has been earmarked for the  , the area does not have any coal seams and it does not have shale deposits worthy of shale gas. In the state of TN, even if shales are worth shale gas, operators cannot extract it because the state and central governments have barred all operators from extracting shale gas and coal bed methane.
 
  
 Since we have worked in the area in the 90s and in 2008-09, the tentative depth is around 2,000 metres to extract crude oil and natural gas. When we are drilling less than 3.5 km, we don't require any hydro-fracking.
 
  
 Only two tankers or 20-25 metre cube per day would be required during the period of drilling, which can be from one month to three months. The drilling process will not lead to loss of groundwater.
 
  
 These fears are unfounded. When the well is dry, when we have finished the project, we restore the land to near original condition. For the drilling pipes, there is cementation behind the casing so that nothing leaks into the main land. Drilling fluid has some chemicals but they are not so harmful to land and because of the casing it does not leak into the adjoining soil and those casings are of international standard. 
 
  
 As far Neduvasal is concerned, now it is the duty of Gem Laboratories Pvt Ltd - they are supposed to interact with local farmers, have the public hearing with them and get the project cleared. It is not within the purview of ONGC.
