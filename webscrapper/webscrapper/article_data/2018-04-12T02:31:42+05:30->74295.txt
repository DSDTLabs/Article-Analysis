NAVI MUMBAI: The   range forest officials have built a water enclosure ( ) on top of the   hills near   waterfalls. The enclosure is meant to act like a catchment area during the monsoon and help meet the water requirements of wild animals and birds.

 “We recently created the bund on Kharghar hills so that the birds and forest animals do not suffer from dehydration,’’ said Panvel range forest officer D Sonawane.
 
 Kharghar-based animal activist,  , who also assisted the forest officials in setting up the water bund, said: “In the coming monsoon season, we should hopefully be able to store enough water here so that it lasts for the next seven to eight months. This is a good endeavour which will help the forest fauna.’’
 
 Meanwhile, forest personnel at   in Panvel taluka are also planning to get water tankers to fill up various watering holes in the forest for the sake of the animals. 
 
 “During the summer, almost all the streams and ponds dry up in the forests. Hence, water tankers have to be hired to fill them up. I myself am planning to give away small earthen water pots which can be hung from branches so that the birds and other animals living on trees inside the sanctuary are benefitted,’’ said activist Vishnu Gavali.
 
 Due to a spate of forest fires in the recent days, most of the wildlife tends to move away from the damaged forest parts. Hence there is need to make arrangements for storing water as it is highly essential for the survival of all jungle animals, including those who have translocated due to the forest fires.
