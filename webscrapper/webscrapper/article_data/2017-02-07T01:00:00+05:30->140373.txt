As expected, last Saturday night also saw peeps thronging city pubs to unwind after a tiring week. And our photog spotted this bunch of partygoers at one of the nightclubs. Their agenda was simple — break free of all worries and party hard with friends. Adding zing to the party was the DJ’s music. Enjoying the groovy numbers were youngsters like Nishtha and Vamsi. The duo were quite upbeat on the dance floor and kept the party mood kicking. While Shilpa loved flaunting her pretty floral dress, Sujith put on a hat that matched his t-shirt and looked all party-ready. Yashika was dressed up in a party wear and even posed animatedly for the shutterbugs.
