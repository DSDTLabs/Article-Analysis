NEW DELHI: A   for the   will be the beginning of unity among   to take on the saffron party, senior JD(U) member   said on Sunday. 

 Having met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last week as part of efforts to put up a joint opposition candidate for the high-stakes polls, the former JD(U) president said the success of this exercise could go a long way in arresting the BJP’s surge across the country. He said unity in the opposition ranks is the need of the hour as a division in the non-BJP votes has been a key reason behind the saffron party’s win in the recent assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi civic elections. 
 
 Asked about the likelihood of major opposition parties agreeing to back a common candidate against the BJP-led NDA’s choice, he told reporters that he was “hopeful” that it will happen. “We are making efforts to get as many opposition parties as possible on a common platform for the presidential election,” he said. 
 
 Asked who could be the opposition candidate for the presidential election, he said the first priority is to bring these parties together. Yadav himself, a veteran parliamentarian, is also seen as one of the probable choices for a common opposition candidate for the presidential polls.
