The Centre will approach the   to reinstate reservation in promotion for SCs and STs in government jobs without any condition, Union minister   said on Tuesday. 

 He said the government may bring an ordinance, if it was needed. The   is examining if there was a need to reconsider a 2006 constitution bench judgment, which made it almost impossible for the Centre and states to enforce the provision. The decision to move court was taken at a meeting of Group of Ministers on Monday, which was also attended by attorney general  . 
 
 This is being seen as yet another move to take forward the Modi government’s Dalit outreach.   said his party is also in favour of reservation for poor from the upper castes. Reservation in promotion had been continuing since 1959. But some court orders have posed obstacles in implementing this despite Centre passing four amendments, Paswan told TOI. 
 
 In the 2006 Nagraj judgment, the SC had held it is not mandatory for the state to make reservations in promotions. However, it said to make such provision, they need to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness, inadequacy of representation and ensure that such promotions don’t impact efficiency. “Untouchability, not backwardness is the reason for SCs to get reservation. There is no evidence that officers from SC/STs are less efficient and SC/STs are less in all government jobs,” Paswan said.
