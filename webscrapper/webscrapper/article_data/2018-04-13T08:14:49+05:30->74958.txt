CHENNAI: As protests against   Narendra Modi’s visit kept the state on the edge, chief minister   on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the PM, requesting him to set up the   immediately. This is CM’s third memorandum to Modi in this regard in the last two months. Edappadi caught up with Modi just before he could board his flight to Delhi.

 Edappadi was flanked by deputy CM   and deputy LS speaker  . “The constitution of CMB has become an integral part of the Supreme Court’s judgment,” the CM said. The state government has been struggling for some face-saving mechanism as public anger is raging against the Centre’s inaction. The state is feeling the heat for its failure to get an appointment with Modi for an all-party and farmers’ delegation. The legislative assembly too passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to set up the board.
 
 “The farmers of delta who are dependent on Cauvery water for irrigation are fervently hoping that the machinery will be constituted by the Centre,” he said.
 
 Hours before Modi landed in Chennai for inaugurating the defence expo, AIADMK MP V Maitreyan said the ensuing Monsoon session of the parliament also could be washed out if the Centre failed to constitute the board. In a Facebook post, Maitreyan said, “I pray better wisdom prevails on the Union government.”
 
 He charged the Congress-led UPA and NDA governments at the Centre with doing little for forming the CMB after the tribunal award was gazetted in 2013. “Instead of showing statesmanship, the Centre, guided by petty electoral considerations, chose to look the other way,” Maitreyan said.
