CHANDIGARH: With garbage strewn at various spots, a ground located near residential lanes of Sector 40-A is reeling under severe civic apathy.

 The ground, which is located next to Arterial Road, accommodates a lot of plastic   scattered all over its premises.
 
 Some specific areas in the ground, which are used for dumping garbage that comprises domestic waste from neighbourhood, have become breading spots for mosquitoes and flies.
 
 "The people, who live in the back lanes of the locality, have been polluting this spot by disposing off garbage. They have been asked to use the dustbins and get the garbage removed from their homes by safai-karamcharis. But they fail to follow the instructions,” said  , a resident.
 
 There is a market next to the park, which has a lot of footfall. “The garbage generated from the shops and of the visitors is also dumped here.
 
 “There is no garbage dumping facility nearby and hence people choose to use this specific area of the ground for dumping waste. If you see closely, you will see skins of vegetables and fruits, rotten food residue and plastic waste along with other kinds of things,” said another resident  .
 
 When asked about informing the municipal corporation, the shopkeepers complained of not receiving any response from the agency.
