AHMEDABAD: Vibrant Gujarat 2015’s most high-profile guest --   - had a brush with the stray dog menace in the city when a canine suddenly crossed the path of his convoy en route the airport. Gandhinagar SP Sharad Singhal had then dubbed it as a “minor” incident. 

 But this time, municipal corporations of   are not taking any chances with such ‘minor’ incidents. Interestingly, though requests from common citizens regarding stray dogs are flooding in, the authorities are only focussing on the routes to be taken by the VIPs, hotels and other such places where the who’s who are put up. 
 
 In Ahmedabad alone, there were close to 67 requests from west and new west zone residential and commercial areas to clear the canines in the last 20 days. On Friday alone, there were 21 requests from across Ahmedabad. 
 
 “We are not attending to all of them but only those that fall on VIP routes, hotels and other such places,” said a senior official of the   (CNCD). 
 
 Areas around major hotels in the twin cities, airport, VIP routes, Vibrant Gujarat summit premises will see an active civic staff in white-coloured dog vans temporarily removing the dogs and cattle from 2.5 km area vicinity ahead of the summit. The vans are active since November, claim officials. 
 
 “Officially though, the   guidelines aer clearly against relocating stray dogs from their current locations as they get aggressive. But the exercise is being done wholly keeping the issue of security in mind,” said an Ahmedabad CNCD official. 
 
 Both these corporations have been denying requests made by citizens to relocate stray dogs from their areas on routine days and Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) is an exception, officials claimed.
