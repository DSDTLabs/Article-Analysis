HYDERABAD: With long fasting hours and hot and sultry weather, health experts suggest that people, who observe fast, should follow a regulated diet during Sahar (predawn meal) and   (post sunset meal) to keep the body running without food and water for more than 15 hours.

  
  
 Incidentally, this   too has created interest in science researchers and medical experts to study the impact of intermittent diurnal fasting on the physiological functions of human body.
 
 Several countries around the world, including the   (where fasting lasts over 18 hours), have issued diet advisories for the devout during Ramzan 2018 to make fasting a pleasant and healthy experience and spiritually rewarding.
 
 The Indian government has not yet issued any official health advisory on the do’s and don’ts for Ramzan fasting. But city doctors have suggested certain foods to keep the body hydrated through the day and prevent health-related issues.
 
 “Diet planning is important during Ramzan fasting. But it is more important this time as Ramzan coincides with the  , the hottest period of the year. Mild dehydration is common, and this can be tackled by consuming foods containing high water content during Sahar and Iftar. One should not eat a heavy meal soon after breaking fast. At Iftar, the preferred diet should be foods containing high water content and low in fat,” suggested senior physician Dr  .
 
 Experts recommend that people observing fast should consume fruits and vegetables at Sahar. They should also consume low-fat soup to keep the body hydrated for as long as 15 hours. One should also avoid going unprotected under hot summer sun as it causes exhaustion. Salt should be used in moderation during Sahar as it is known to create thirst.
