HYDERABAD: With general elections a year away, the   (TRS) which has already firmed up its poll strategy is assessing its outcome. The party is confident of winning all 16 Lok Sabha seats with its 'ally' AIMIM retaining the Hyderabad seat, top leaders said. 

 The party has also calculated that it will win a minimum of 100 assembly seats out of the 119. The AIMIM is expected to retain the seven seats it has now. The TRS which has a tacit understanding with AIMIM, however, will field its own candidates in those constituencies also. 
 
 TRS believes the BJP will not win a single seat. If the TRS and MIM together will get 107 seats, only 12 seats remain. "There is no guarantee of the   to win in those seats because the TRS will fight it out for a win," Government whip in the council, P   said 
 
 Rajeshwara Reddy who is also general secretary of TRS said the party leadership has its strategy ready for the 2014 general secretary and will play a decisive role at the Centre in government formation. "The BJP will not win enough seats to form the party on its own and neither will the Congress. This is for sure," he said. 
 
 In this scenario, the TRS has formulated plans to play an active role and that would get the state the maximum benefit. "Any government that will form at the Centre will need TRS support," said Rajeshwara Reddy. "The few assembly seats that the BJP won in the 2014 elections was due to backing of other parties. So in the 2019 assembly polls, it will be reduced to a zero," he said. 
 
 In the 2014 polls, the TRS LS elections, the MIM won from Hyderabad, the BJP won from Secunderabad, and Congress won from Nalgonda and Nagarkurnool, YSRCP won from Khammam, TDP from  . However,   from Khammam and Malla Reddy from Malkajgiri switched over to the TRS.
