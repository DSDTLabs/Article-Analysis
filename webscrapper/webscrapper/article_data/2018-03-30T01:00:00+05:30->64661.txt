When   decided to do up his pad, he didn’t have to look far for an interior designer. His fiancée   took the responsibility upon herself. She has been taking personal interest in re-decorating Ashmit’s bachelor pad into a home for the couple. Maheck and Ashmit have been living together since their engagement in August last year, and plan to tie the knot soon. Ashmit bought a pad in Bandra a few years ago when he was still single. Though Maheck is not a professional designer, she has a keen eye for interiors. Hence, she has stepped in to beautify the house and turn it into a home. The duo is likely to move in by the end of this month.

 Ashmit shares, “It’s just beautiful to have someone take up the responsibility of converting your pad into a home. Maheck is giving some final touches to the place. We are very keen to move in together.”
