NEW DELHI:   (DCW) chief   was granted bail by a special court on Monday in a case of alleged irregularities in the recruitment process of the commission.

 Maliwal appeared before special judge   after a summon was issued by the court on January 18. Observing that the evidence in the case was documentary in nature and Maliwal was not required for custodial interrogation, the court granted her bail on a personal bond of Rs 20,000 and a surety of the like amount.
 
 The court was informed that Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) was carrying out further investigation in accordance with the court’s direction and it would take some time to conclude it. 
 
 Maliwal also informed the court that she received a copy of the ACB’s chargesheet and other relevant documents. ACB has alleged that Maliwal, in connivance with others, abused her official position and deliberately ignored the procedure laid down in general finance rules and other rules to employ associates and party workers beyond the sanctioned strength of 26 posts, causing unauthorised benefits to them at the cost of the public exchequer.
