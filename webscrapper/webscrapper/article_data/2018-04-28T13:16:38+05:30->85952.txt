AHMEDABAD/GANDHINAGAR: Former   MLA from Dhari in   district,  , asserted that he is innocent in the bitcoin extortion case, after his name surfaced in the interrogation of accused persons arrested by CID (crime). Kotadiya has alleged that the complainant in the case,  , is trying to drag him into the controversy.

 Kotadiya told mediapersons, “I am a man of public life. I meet people and talk to them on the phone. It does not mean that I am involved in criminal acts with the people I meet or talk to on the phone.”
 
 Kotadiya said that misinformation was being spread that   had transferred 200 bitcoins to police inspector Anant Patel and this has been proven in the forensic examination. “If the bitcoins were not transferred the question that arises is where the money came from,” Kotadiya said.
 
 He said that to hide the facts, someone is fabricating stories about his involvement in the  . “Bhatt accepted that he was investing money from people affiliated with political parties. To protect them, attempts are being made to fix me in the case,” Kotadiya added.
 
 Kotadiya said he kept silent as CID crime was investigating. Now, he feels that Bhatt could destroy evidence. “I have come to know that Amreli SP   is being pressurised to implicate me in the case. I ready to face a probe by any agency,” he added.
