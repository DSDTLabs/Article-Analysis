MUMBAI: The   on Monday lamented “the state of affairs“ that has made the   lag behind the world in using modern investigation techniques.

 “We are sorry to say that though the world has gone ahead and police officers are using modern techniques in investigation, we find the state of Maharashtra and other states are lagging in this field,“ said a bench of Justice   and Justice P R Bora.
 
 The court heard a PIL urging police reforms. It was converted from a petition filed by Ashwini Rane, widow of a slain Pune builder. Nikhil Rane was fired at on November 23, 2009 and died a week later. Even after the case was transferred to the CBI by the HC, it could not be cracked.
 
 Senior advocate Anil Anturkar, appearing for Rane, argued that despite the HC asking the government in 2014 if it has a system to periodically look into unsolved cases, it did not reply. Anturkar said that in all such cases people have “had to accept the truth and in private, they weep in their rooms.“
 
 The judges expressed their “anguish over the state of affairs of the police depart ment“ and said there is “lack of will on the part of the home department in reviewing methods of investigation“.They said the methods used are “outdated“ and, inevitably, result in the accused being released by giving a benefit of doubt. They said the police are not provided facilities and even advanced weapons.“Some of them are still using vintage .302 rifle and they are not removed from the armoury ,“ they added The judges said the police academy at Nashik needs to be overhauled and new techniques, including creating a fingerprint bank, need to be incorporated in the training schedule. They directed the advocate general “to look into the matter and inform what the state proposes to do in respect of the (court's) directions given“ on March 10.
