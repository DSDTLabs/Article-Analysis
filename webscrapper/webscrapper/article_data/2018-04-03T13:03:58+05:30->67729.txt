VADODARA: Cashier of a mobile services provider   was booked at   for siphoning off Rs 3 lakh.

 According to police, the accused Vijay Jadav, who worked at   in Makarpura since March 2016, had gone missing in September last year with over Rs 5 lakh.
 
 The company’s store manager told the police in his complaint that Jadav, who was responsible for collecting mobile bill payments and cash for recharge of pre-paid customers, complained of ill health and went home from work in September without depositing the money with the store. 
 
 After few days, the company’s officials sent him a mail to remind him of depositing the money. However, on not returning to work, the store manager went to his home where Jadav’s wife told him that he was not at home.
 
 The store manager told her that Jadav has over Rs 5 lakh of the company and he will have to deposit the money with the company immediately.
 
  A day later, Jadav’s brother-in-law from Surat contacted the company and informed that he will try to return as much amount as he can. He later gave Rs 2 lakh at Vodafone’s office in Surat.
 
 When Jadav did not turn up with the remaining amount, the company gave a complaint against him at Makarpura police station on the basis of which cops registered an FIR for criminal breach of trust.
