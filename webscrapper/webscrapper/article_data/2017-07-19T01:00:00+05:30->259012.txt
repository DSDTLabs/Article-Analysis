Director Sabbir Khan’s  , featuring Tiger Shroff,   Siddiqui and newcomer   is all set to doff its hat to the King of Pop,   this Friday. The movie blends action, romance, drama and comedy with an emotional story of a boy from Teen Batti in Mumbai.
Here’s why you could buy a ticket to this one:
 
 
 
 'Munna Michael' seamlessly fell into place. Tiger and I have long been discussing the story for a while now, and we finally managed to put it all together. Producer Viki Rajani believed in my vision and was happy to support it all the way. Nawazuddin agreed to do the film even before I was ready with the script. After a nationwide audition, we found Nidhhi who has the makings of a star. 
 
 
 
 
 As a producer I’m constantly on the lookout for content that is substantial and entertaining. 'Munna Michael' has all the ingredients of a perfect entertainer. It’s also the country’s first dance-action film and I’m proud to associate myself with it.
