COIMBATORE:   president   on Sunday expressed his support to chief minister O Panneerselvam in the ongoing rivalry between the latter and   

 Addressing reporters in the city, Manian said, “No one is accepting Sasikala as chief minister and people knew her and her family members who had involved in atrocities across the state. She should not become the chief minister. So, we are supporting  .”
 
 Though Sasikala and OPS are made from same the mould, we support OPS because he is slightly better than Sasikala, he added. 
 
 Sasikala and Panneerselvam are made from the same mould. But we support Panneerselvam because he is slightly better, Manian said, adding AIADMK won’t come back to power if re-election takes place for the assembly. 
 
 People won’t forget photographs of Sasikala wearing gold jewellery during Sudhakaran’s marriage published in 1996. Panneerselvam’s photo with Sekar Reddy was also not forgettable. However, OPS is slightly better than Sasikala.
 
 “If the apex court’s judgment comes against Sasikala, immediately all the MLAs will go to OPS side and will make him chief minister. They wanted to rule the state for further four years. Then only they can earn crores of rupees. They are selfish and they won’t do anything for people of the state,” he added.
 
 He added that OPS was forced to resign by Sasikala hence it is not valid legally. “The governor should invite OPS first to prove his majority in the assembly,” said Manian.
 
 People suspect foul play behind the death of former chief minister J  . CBI should probe into Jayalalithaa’s death, he said.
