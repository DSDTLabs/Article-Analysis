Tuticorin: Earlier this year, the superintendents of police (SP) of Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts had told reporters that they will be registering cases against helmet defaulters in large numbers to bring down loss of life on the roads. Some officers also said targets were fixed for the police personnel on number of cases to be registered. There are days when 2,000 or more cases are registered in a district against those who are not wearing helmets. Motorists said that they are soft targets as police find it easy to spot those without helmets and book cases or take money from them as they can be openly identified, unlike other violations which require verification. Some of the annoying methods used by the police to stop bikers for vehicle checks are by barging in front of the bikes in the middle of the road - forcing motorists to hit on the brakes hard, attacking the rider on his head or back with a lathi or inserting it into the wheels. Activist V Gunaselan of Tuticorin said that the police should not fix targets for imposing fines on those without helmets.  “The SP fixes target for the deputy superintendents of police and from them to the inspectors, sub inspectors and those in lower ranks. They are forced to catch violators and resort to violence to stop the motorists,” he said. The activist suggested that the checks should be conducted in areas without traffic congestion.  “Stopping vehicles in the city during peak traffic hours irritates law abiding road users. It develops hatred towards the police,” he added. He alleged that attacks by police on motorists are happening very frequently but they go unreported.  Noting that the government has announced compensation to the family of Usha, who got killed in the police attack during vehicle check in Trichy on Wednesday night, and arrest of the inspector involved, he asked what action would be taken on the officers who had put pressure on him.
