MUMBAI: Two   were arrested on Sunday for allegedly extorting Rs 2,700 from an engineer and his friend who had dropped a cigarette butt on the footpath at CSMT. The two clean-up marshals-Jayesh   (27) and   (26) -have been charged with extortion and have been sent to police custody, said officials of Azad Maidan police station.

 Civil engineer   had lodged a complaint. The police said that on February 6, while Jadhav and his colleague Abhishek were walking towards CSMT when they threw the cigrette butts. Immediately the two marshals cornered them saying that the two will have to pay a fine of Rs 25,000. "The marshals led Abhishek and Jadhav separately in a nearby lane and threatened to book them. They then bargained and told them to pay a lesser amount," said a police officer.
 
 While Sawant took Rs 2,500 from Abhishek by making him withdraw from an ATM kiosk, Gaikar took Rs 200 from Jadhav.
 
 "The next day Jadhav and Abhishek decided to find out if the clean-up marshals were genuine as they had not given them any reciept for Rs 2,700 they had paid," said a senior police officer.
 
 On Saturday, they spotted the two marshals opposite the CSMT subway and immediately approached the police station. "Our team arrested the two clean-up marshals," said the officer.
