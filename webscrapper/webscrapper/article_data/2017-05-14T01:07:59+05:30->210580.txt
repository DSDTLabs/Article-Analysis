THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC)—in its fourth leg of the mega anti-encroachment drive—razed over 400 stalls and handcarts on Saturday.

 A delegation of close to 100 volunteers and civic officials, led by TMC chief Sanjeev Jaiswal, razed illegal structures at Subhash Road, Tiku-jini-wadi, Lokpuram, Tulsidham and  . They demolished stalls using JCB machines. 
 
 The team also re-visited the stretch from Thane station to Jambli Naka to ensure that the encroachments that had been razed over the first three days of the   had not cropped up again.
 
 “The  , who was out of town on Friday, reached Thane on Saturday evening and immediately accompanied his team for the anti-encroachment drive. He ensured that no hawker will set shop in the area again. The corporation has spent a lot of money and labour in widening the roads, and all this work is useless if these roads are occupied by hawkers. This is why the commissioner has taken this initiative very seriously,” said a senior civic official.
 
 The 250-plus illegally parked vehicles cleared from under SATIS area and along the encroached station road since yesterday have been kept at Thane’s Jawahar Baug area under strict vigil by the civic volunteers and will be returned to the owners only after they pay the fine.
 
 Speaking about the initiative, secretary of Eden Woods housing society T N Raghunatha, said, “The TMC pulled down at least 50 illegal shops and stalls along   road, which used to be flooded with fruit and vegetable  . The moment they began the drive, we could see hawkers packing up and fleeing. However, three shops were spared along this stretch as they are being run by the disabled. For the last several months, we have been complaining to the TMC about the illegal hawkers and make-shift stalls occupying the areas here. It is great to see the TMC take strict action against them.”
