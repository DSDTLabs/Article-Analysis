KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Monday disposed a petition seeking a court directive for building a three-tier flyover at  . A petition filed by one Shameer   of   in Kochi was disposed by the court after the state government informed that the final plan has been approved and it is not possible to make changes now. 

 The court disposed the petition after the government submitted that suggestions and complaints can be addressed before a five-member expert committee that is headed by the principal secretary of public works department.
 
 While declining to interfere directly, the court pointed out that the government has informed that it will consider the suggestions made before the expert committee at the next stage of development.
 
 It was alleged by the petitioner that the present plan is flawed and would only help 40% of the vehicles as those who need to turn to the side roads have to wait at the   signal, as is happening at   Junction. "If the flyover is constructed in the present manner, by spending Rs 78- Rs 13 crore as planned, it will end up only in another catastrophe like the one at Edappally which cannot be rectified at a later stage," the petition had said. No other vehicles other than those moving along NH-66 would be benefited by the flyover, as has been done at Edappally and Palarivattom, it was alleged by the petitioner. 
 
 The state government pointed out that the flyover is being constructed on the national highway. At the same time, complaints and suggestions about the other roads coming in to   can be submitted before the expert committee, the affidavit had said. There are several multi-storied buildings around Vytilla and the present project was planned in such a way as to minimize the loss to the government while taking over or demolishing such buildings to make the project a reality, the government had told the court.
