PATNA: Former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said on Wednesday the BJP-ruled Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were not opposed to the proposed goods and services ( ) tax regime for the country and, in fact, strived to protect their interests.

 Addressing a function organized at the state BJP headquarters to release a booklet on the GST brought by the party’s traders’ cell state convener Neeraj Kumar, Modi said the propaganda was later launched to malign the Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh governments saying they had opposed the GST to foil its implementation by the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre.
 
 Giving details of the new tax regime enforced from July 1, Modi said the revenue losses suffered by the states concerned would be compensated by the Centre over five years. He reiterated that Bihar would be among the biggest beneficiaries of the new tax regime, as its annual revenue earnings would increase by around 25%. 
 
 During the just ended 2016-17 financial year, the revenue returns of the state had increased only by 9%, he said, adding that if the increase in the tax revenue of any state would be less than 14%, the Centre would compensate the differential amount.
 
 “In fact, no state opposed the GST. All the states merely strived to protect their financial interests in the proposed new tax regime,” said Modi, who was chairman of the empowered committee of the states’ finance ministers under the UPA government at the Centre. 
 
 Among those who participated in the booklet release function included the BJP state president, Nityanand Rai.
