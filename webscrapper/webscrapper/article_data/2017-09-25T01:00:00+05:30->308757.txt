Everyone, especially political parties, would like to set down diktats for the youth — the way they behave, celebrate or imbibe the Western culture. A calculated move, politicians use the youth to enforce their agenda in order to secure vote banks. Couples married off on Valentine’s Day under the pretext of propagating Bharatiya Sabhyata was one such initiative that got the whole nation talking. &TV’s latest show, ' ', is based on this form of extremism, where moral policing succeeds in forging a marital bond between two individuals, Arjun ( ) and Chandni ( ), who can’t stand each other. In fact, they fall prey to the political 
aspirations of Chandni’s father,   ( ). A marriage without love and respect is nothing but a ‘half marriage’. 
 
 Will this union change the perception of marriages or will it backfire on Vanraj’s motives?
 
 Watch the story unfold on 'Half Marriage', which starts tonight, and will air every Monday to Friday at 7.30 pm on &TV.
