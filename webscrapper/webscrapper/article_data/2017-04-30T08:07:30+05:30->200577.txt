LUCKNOW: The executive committee of the   is meeting for two days beginning May 1 to draw a roadmap for success in Lok Sabha elections in 2019. With record 73 Lok Sabha seats won in the 2014 elections and 325 in the recent UP assembly election, the focus of discussion during the   would be on increasing the vote share, a senior BJP leader said.

 Since BJP won 42% vote share each in Lok Sabha and assembly elections, the think-tank now wants to focus on 38% votes it has failed to win. This obviously doesn't include the 20% Muslim vote because the BJP leadership is of the view that the minority community would still not prefer to come into the partyfold, said a leader.
 
 In the 38% vote share, the maximum comprises Dalits while the rest include Yadavs and other backward caste voters, a leader said. In view of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the party may form a strategy to attract Dalit votes in its favour. As part of the strategy, a section of the party leaders believes that the new president who replaces Keshav Prasad Maurya—now the deputy chief minister in Yogi government—should be a Dalit.
 
 This would help the party further to make a dent on Mayawati’s votebank. Some of the names doing rounds from the Dalit caste Agra MP Ramshanker Katheria, Sriram Chauhan and Ramesh Ratna, who has been general secretary in the national BJP SC Cell.
 
 Once the BJP attracts majority of Dalit votes in its favour, it would be in a strong position to rule for two to three terms, the BJP leaders believe. The executive meeting would be held at Scientific Convention Centre and on May 1, the executive committee meet will be inaugurated by chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi while the closing ceremony on May 2 would be attended by national BJP chief  .
