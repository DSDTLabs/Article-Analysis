PANAJI: It is too early to estimate the extent of the impact demonetization will have on the forthcoming   but political leaders do envisage a restraint in their spending power.

 It is an open secret that most leaders in Goa, irrespective of their party affiliations, use  , including municipal and panchayats, but things might be a little different this time due to the cash crunch. 
 
 An outgoing MLA of the BJP admitted that he is facing problems in arranging  . “I bank on my good work of the last five years. I was accessible to all my constituents and have helped them in the best possible way,” he said, sounding worried. Most are trying to accumulate cash as much as possible by using their ‘connections’, he pointed out.
 
 As an election expense, the maximum a candidate can spend is Rs 20 lakh. Candidates, in some constituencies, are known to spend over a crore of rupees with cash distribution done during the last two days of the election. 
 
 “It’s a crucial time for candidates to turn voters in their favour. People will not admit but it does happen,” a source said. 
 
 An election official said that despite monitoring, they are aware parties exceed the permissible expenses. This time though candidates will not be able to spend as they used to, he said. 
 
 “When it comes to election expenditure,   always try to hoodwink us but this time around we don’t see much of a problem,” he added. He did not rule out the possibility of candidates employing novel ways to woo voters.
 
 An outgoing minister too admitted that demonetization will impact all candidates irrespective of their party affiliation. “Our expenses will be curtailed,” he said, sounding frustrated.
