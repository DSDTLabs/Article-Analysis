Bhavnagar:   is all set to become important destination for aspiring shooters.

 The  , a group founded by industrialist Mehul Patel, as well as other like-minded people in Bhavnagar to promote literature and sports have started promoting shooting as a sport.
 
 “Members of Arya Mandal decided to promote shooting by providing robust infrastructure. The two basic requirements for shooting is — availability of shooting ranges and precision arms and ammunition. We have set up modern shooting range (20m and 50m range) in a school premise in Akwada area of Bhavnagar with imported arms and ammunition. Currently, 85 students are undergoing training at the range,” said Mehul, who is also president of Bhavnagar District Rifle Association, affiliated to the Gujarat State Rifle Association.
 
 Arya Mandal has named new shooting Range after freedom fighter ‘Sardarsinhji Rana’.
 
 When Shivbhadrasinhji Gohil of Bhavnagar Royal family learnt about the shooting activity, he handed over Shree Bhavnagar Rifle Club, which was founded by Krishnakumarsinhji Gohil in early 1960s, to Patel. “Shivbhadrasinhji also handed over four arms which were used by the then members of Shree Bhavnagar Rifle Club. For us, these weapons have vintage value. We use these arms for training purpose as well,” said Patel.
 
 Patel said that they are approaching schools in   and Bhavnagar district to set up shooting ranges in their campuses so that students get shooting training at school campus.
 
 “Our efforts have started showing results. Four shooters from our range have reached national level while three won gold medals at state-level competitions,” Patel added.
 
 “Till date we have three shooting ranges in schools in Bhavnagar and more are likely to come up. We aim to start at least 25 shooting ranges in the district. Once we create robust infrastructure for shooting, talent will come and shine in the country,” he added. The new shooting ranges will be managed by Arya Mandal.
