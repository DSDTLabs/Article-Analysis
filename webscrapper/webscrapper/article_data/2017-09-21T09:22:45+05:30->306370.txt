THODUPUZHA: Women serving a   or cajoling a Rum regular to try out a Pina Colada with a dash of cream is nothing new in our metros, but   in a comparative backwater like   certainly is. 

 If gender is no bar for new-age professions, why should bars be an exception, seems to be the rationale of   at Thodupuzha in Idukki district which has employed two   in its bar, and plans to recruit many more in the coming days. “Women are working in every sector and there is no room for taboos,” said Jilmon George, the facility’s MD. He goes on to emphasize that his women employees are safe and happy and don’t face any harassment from customers.
 
 Raji (33), a native of Kuthattukulam in Ernakulam district, nods in agreement. “It is a work I do with complete satisfaction. I am happy to work here and have never experienced any difficulty with customers here,” she said. She says her testimony has attracted her friends too to this field. “I recommend that more women should come to this area of employment. There is no room for apprehensions,” she added.
 
 The bar, which got four-star licence recently, currently has 20 staffers in the bar and 40 in the restaurant.
