The exam season is here and one of the biggest problems that parents face in the city is restricting their usage of social media through their smartphones and tablets.   gets talking to parents on how they monitor their children during these times.
Smart monitoring
 Karuna Chandran, mother of a ninth grader, says, “I hid my daughter’s phone to help avoid distraction during exams. But there is the computer anyway, so time on that is monitored — no computer unless a certain amount of work has been done, and even if she is allowed, it is restricted to a maximum of 20 minutes of free time.” 
 And it isn’t parents of teenagers alone. Given how smartphones have a high degree of fascination among children right from those in their primary, parents are finding new ways of imposing control. “My son compulsively checks his many social media accounts, be it  , Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat. It is tough to ensure they stay away from it, given their peer pressure. Just curbing one can be tough. All his friends’ parents and I have jointly begun to restrict their usage. This ensures that their free time matches each other’s,” says  , mother of a fifth grader. 
 Exercise self-control
 Students are exercising self-control in many cases. Nimrat Singh, a behavioural scientist, says, “These things have to be negotiable and there needs to be a dialogue so the child does not view this as a punishment. If they have earned their break time you can reward them.” She suggests that students must not use their phones towards the end of the day just before going to bed as these are over stimulants and disturb one’s sleep.
