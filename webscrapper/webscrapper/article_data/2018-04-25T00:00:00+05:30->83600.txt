Joining the list of actresses who take on heroine-centric films is   Tamilarasan. The youngster is quite kicked about playing the titular role in AiLa —  , a horror thriller. 

 Chandini says, “It’s not often that you get to play the titular role. And this film has a really nice concept. It’s not a typical horror film — there is a lot of emotional undercurrent, and I’m confident that the audience will not be disappointed.”
 
 The film, helmed by RV  , will be shot in Chennai, and parts of Kerala and Europe. It also stars   (of   fame) and   in important roles.
 
 While Chandini is reluctant to reveal details about her character, all she says is, “I play an urban woman, who is a passionate photographer. We are finalising details of all the characters”
 
 Interestingly, the actress has been part of a couple of horror films in Tollywood before. “The genre is not new, but the story is. In Chitram Bhalare Vichitram, I played the spirit, and we completed shooting for the film within 30-odd days. I know how demanding it is to do rope shots and other such scenes. AiLa has a tight script, and I’m looking forward to begin shooting by July,” she signs off.
