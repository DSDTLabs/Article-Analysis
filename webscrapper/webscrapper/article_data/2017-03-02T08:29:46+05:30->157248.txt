RUDRAPUR: A 16-year-old boy who was held by cops and being interrogated in connection with the alleged abduction of a minor girl has died in police custody, triggering protests in  . 

 The teenager, Ziyauddin Raza, was found “hanging” on Tuesday inside the Katoratal police chowki of Kashipur and had been picked up four days ago after the girl disappeared. The girl, also a minor, has now been found in Lucknow, raising questions about the way police handled the case. Parents of the boy said when he was taken by cops, he wasn’t carrying anything, so it’s strange how he was hanging by a rope while in police custody. 
 
 Senior superintendent of police Senthil Aboodeyi KS has suspended four policemen and ordered a probe into the matter. A case of murder has been registered against nine people, including a sub-inspector, a scribe, five unidentified policemen and two others. 
 
 Meanwhile, taking suo motu cognisance of the matter, the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has given 72 hours to the US Nagar SSP to investigate the reason behind the death of child and present its report before the commission. Deputy inspector general, Kumaon, Ajay Rautela said, “After the boy’s death, a lawsuit has been filed against nine persons from the department. The probe has been ordered and Nainital district police will be carrying it.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the accused policemen have gone absconding. Raza, a student of class 10th, was picked by police four days back, after a girl from the same community went missing from Kotabagh area, and a case was registered at the Katoratal police chowki. According to the cops, the boy was found hanging and was taken to the hospital where he was declared brought dead.
