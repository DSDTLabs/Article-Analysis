Chandigarh: Union minister for food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday to take up the matter of change of name of Dayal Singh Evening College at Delhi.

 She requested the PM to sack college’s governing council chairman Amitabh Sinha for going against the human resource development (HRD) ministry’s undertaking against the name change.
 
 She apprised the PM that despite a written assurance by HRD minister Prakash Javedkar on January 16, the college management deliberately put up banners with the name ‘Vande Matram Dayal Singh College’ at its annual prize distribution function on April 25.
 
 She said this resulted in inflaming Sikh community’s sentiments. She alleged that Sinha was deliberately misusing the name ‘Vande Matram’ at the cost of destroying the legacy of noted philanthropist and social reformer Dayal Singh Majithia who had donated all his wealth for public welfare.
 
 Harsimrat also requested strict action against Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh K Tyagi for allegedly extending indirect support to Sinha. She added Tyagi had failed to act against Sinha despite several complaints.
 
 The Union minister also said the governing council violated the college transfer deed by renaming it as ‘Vande Matram College’ on November 17 last year.
 
 The transfer deed clearly stipulates that the institution would continue to be known as Dayal Singh College after its takeover by Delhi University in 1978, she added. The land on which the college has been constructed still stands in Dayal Singh College Trust Society’s name, said the minister.
 
 Harsimrat also said there was a need to immediately dispel the impression that the college governing council is oppressive against the minority community. After her meeting, the Union minister said the PM assured her to look into the matter.
