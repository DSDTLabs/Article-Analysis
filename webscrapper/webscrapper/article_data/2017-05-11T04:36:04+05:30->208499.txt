ISLAMABAD: The   retracted from its aggressive ingression into civilian domain by withdrawing from its earlier controversial tweet on Wednesday in which it had rejected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s directives on an inquiry report into Dawn Leaks, a news story about last year’s high-level meeting revealing military’s inaction against militant outfits.

 The move was unprecedented considering the military’s influence over civilian set-up in a country with a history of military coups. It came after a high-level civil-military meeting in   between Prime Minister  , Army chief  , and ISI chief Naveed Mukhtar among others.
 
 “The tweet on April 29, 2017, was not against any government office or person. Recommendations of the inquiry committee report, duly approved by the Prime Minister, have been implemented, which has settled the Dawn Leaks issue,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), army’s media wing, said in a statement.
 
 “Pakistan Army reiterates its firm commitment and continued resolve to uphold the Constitution of the   and support the democratic process,” Major General Asif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesperson, later said in a press briefing.
 
 On April 29, PM Sharif’s office had issued directives to remove Syed Tariq Fatemi, special assistant to the PM on foreign affairs, from his post for his alleged role in Dawn leaks. Prior to Fatemi’s sacking, information minister   had also been fired in connection to Dawn’s story.
 
 Following PM office’s directives, army’s spokesperson, had tweeted, “Notification on Dawn Leak is incomplete and not in line with recommendations by the Inquiry Board. Notification is rejected.”
 
 Last year, Dawn’s story, “Act against militants or face international isolation, civilians tell military” had described what transpired in a high-level huddle in which the civil leadership allegedly criticised the military’s policies on militancy.
