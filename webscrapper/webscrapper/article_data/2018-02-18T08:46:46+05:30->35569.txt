BARNALA: Punjab cabinet minister   has accused SAD president Sukhbir Badal of amassing immense wealth during the last 10 years of the SAD-BJP rule in the state. Sidhu alleged Sukhbir had made so much money that as per an estimate, 18 former presidents of SAD had not more than 1% of his total wealth.

 Sidhu, who was addressing a social gathering at the residence of Bhagwan Dass, a panchyat member of   village in Barnala district on Friday evening, said it was not a vague estimate and he could prove the claim if Sukhbir came up for a debate with him. On February 15, Sukhbir had called Sidhu a monkey.
 
 “The Akali Dal has had many presidents till now in its 97 years illustrious history, of which 18 lived in penury and had personal wealth equal to only 1% of what Sukhbir amassed in the last 10 years. I openly challenge Sukhbir to have a debate with me on this and various other issues confronting Punjab, including corruption unleashed by Akalis. If Sukhbir is able to defeat me in the debate I will quit politics,” Sidhu said to an applause by villagers.
 
 Not stopping there, Sidhu said SAD led by Sukhbir only indulged in corruption and looted the state treasury by inflating bills of various developments works in the state running into thousands of crores. Meanwhile, Sukhbir could not be reached for comments.
 
 Earlier, Sidhu called upon youths to take interests in sports activities and shun drugs. He announced Rs 5 lakh for sporting activities in the village and praised Sangrur SSP   for creating national-level sports infrastructure at the Police Lines. He asked people to take part in 550th   celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev to be organised by the state government next year under the theme ‘Nanak Naam Charhdi Kala, Tere Bhaaney Sarbat da Bhala.’
 
 Barnala ADC Arvinder Pal Sigh, SSP Harjit Singh, Sangrur SSP and Ludhiana (rural) SSP   were present on the occasion.
