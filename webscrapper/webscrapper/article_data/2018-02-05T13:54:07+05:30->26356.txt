MARGAO: A proposal to impose a tax on the collection of garbage dominated the major proceedings of the gram sabha meeting conducted by the Assolna village panchayat on Sunday.

 Assolna sarpanch   told TOI that while the panchayat is collecting dry waste, there is a problem regarding wet waste.
 
 “We will conduct a public awareness programme by inviting an expert to talk on this vital subject. I have also informed the villagers that we will fix a tax for garbage collection. However, some villagers are objecting to this proposal that will be discussed in the next gram sabha,” he said.
 
 Panchayat secretary Prabhakar Kamati said that due to lack of funds, the panchayat proposes to increase the house tax and this will be included in the agenda of the next gram sabha.
 
 “There is a resolution passed at the previous gram sabha to write to the South Goa Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar to provide close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) to be installed where garbage is being dumped. Land is still being identified for the garbage collected since the previous site was rejected by the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) as they were fields,” Kamati said.
