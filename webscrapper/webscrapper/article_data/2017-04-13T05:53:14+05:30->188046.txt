AHMEDABAD: It has emerged during questioning of Indian Mujahideen operative   and his   that silver wood used for making bombs — planted in Ahmedabad and Surat — was bought from Shimoga, some 170km from  .   and Haddi have been sent to police remand for five more days.

  Crime branch officials said Bhatkal had selected silver wood for making boat-shaped bombs because the wood is soft and is easily shattered. “Bhatkal has also confessed that aluminium foil used in the bombs was bought from Udipi in Karnataka,” said assistant commissioner of police, crime branch, Rajdeepsinh Zala.
 
 Senior crime branch sources confirmed that Bhatkal bought about 60 pieces of silver wood to make the bombs. Crime branch sources said it has also came to light that after Bhatkal was arrested from the Indo-Nepal border at Raxual in Bihar, a Pakistani national, Zia-ur-Rehman, took over as the main bomb maker for IM. However, he too was arrested later and sentenced to death in the Hyderabad blast case, along with Bhatkal and Haddi.
 
 “We have to identity and locate some persons who could have played a role in the July 2008 Ahmedabad blasts,” said a senior crime branch official. Crime branch officials said that after Bhatkal’s arrest, the terror outfit had been rendered leaderless in India. “IM’s Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal, supposedly based in Pakistan, could plan an attack to free key IM suspects lodged in different jails in the country,” said a crime branch official.
