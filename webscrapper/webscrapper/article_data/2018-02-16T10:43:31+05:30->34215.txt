 The system was launched on February 8 but made available for the general public from February 12. However, due to technical glitches the system could not be started at that timer 
 
 The building plan was processed by a team led by nodal officer of the project  .
 
 Sharing details, Joshi said that they had submitted the plan online at https://chdarchitect.caddisplan.com/ and it was automatically scrutinised vis-Ã -vis building bylaws by the software. He added that a message was received after the plan was approved.
 
 To spare city residents of the ordeal of running from pillar to post for getting their building plans approved, the Chandigarh administration has introduced the online building plan approval system. It also aims to expedite scrutiny by eliminating lengthy and cumbersome manual process. 
 
 Till now, the residents had to submit their building plans along with prints of drawings, which are processed manually.
