JALANDHAR: The Punjab assembly elections saw no independent candidate win this time. The only independent contender which had chance of winning this time was Rajdeep Kaur, sister of gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky from Fazilka, who finished third but with a margin of just 1,141 votes from winning candidate Davinder Singh Ghubaya of Fazilka.

 In 2012, there were three independent candidates - Bains brothers Balwinder Singh and Simarjeet Singh and Rajnish Kumar Babbi from Mukerian, who was a Congress rebel. Later, Babbi joined the Congress and this time he was party candidate and won again. This time Bains brother registered their own party Lok Insaaf Party and also won. In 2012, Rocky had himself lost by a slender margin to BJP candidate from Fazilka. 
 
 In 2007, there were five independent candidates. Sangat Singh Giljian won from Tanda while Charanjit Channi won from Chamkaur Sahib. Both later joined the Congress. There were three rebel candidates in 2007, who also won. They were Madan Lal from Ghanaur, who contested as an independent after being denied ticket by party and this time has won as party candidate, Iqbal Singh Jhunda was SAD rebel from Dhuri and Ajit Singh was Congress rebel from Nihal Singh Wala.
 
 However, this time the contest was already three cornered across the state and some of the potential independent candidates or potential rebels had joined AAP. “Moreover this time the anti-incumbency wave was very strong and people did not want to take any chances of diving their votes and preferred the big parties and a clear mandate,” said a political observer.
