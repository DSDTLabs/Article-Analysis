MUMBAI: The MMRDA on Wednesday said to the Bombay   that it would soon inform it whether the proposed   line on SV Road in the western suburbs could be laid  , as in south Mumbai.

 A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyaz Chagla heard a public interest litigation by H-West Ward Association objecting to the proposed elevated Metro-2B line between Dahisar and Mankhurd that runs along the median of SV Road on the stretch between Vile Parle and Bandra. 
 
 In the past, the association had moved the high court and was told to make a representation to the MMRDA.
 
 Now, association advocate Zubin Behramkamdin said the MMRDA had not replied to the representation
 
 “This part should also be underground, as it is in South Mumbai,” he said.
 
  He said that notices were issued by the contractor to residents on March 20 and even to authorities like the BMC for permissions.
