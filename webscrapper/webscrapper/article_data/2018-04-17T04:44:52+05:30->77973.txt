 "We will study what the manufacturers have to say and then prepare a report for the consideration of the empowered committee," said Gawai. 
 
 Ravi Jashnani, president of the  , welcomed the move to form a committee. "The government has opened up a window for us," he said. He said they had apprised Fadnavis about the largescale recycling already happening in the state. "We will take more steps to increase recycling," said Jashnani. 
 
 However, Kadam said the ban would remain and the manufacturers should have taken up recycling much earlier.
