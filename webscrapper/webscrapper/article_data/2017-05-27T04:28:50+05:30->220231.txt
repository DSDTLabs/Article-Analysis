AHMEDABAD: He said more than ‘Ja jee le apni zindagi, Shaheen’. 

  Vohra, who plays villain in Gujarati films, is a real-life hero for his daughter and son-in-law as he not only gave nod to his daughter Shaheen’s marriage with Aziz Vohra, who had a medical history of kidney failure twice, but also honoured his promise and gave his kidney for the third transplant to Aziz. “I had told   that no father would agree to marrying his daughter to a man who has had kidney transplant twice. But papa surprised us saying that true love should be solemnized. In fact, he also promised that if I land in trouble with my kidney again, he will donate it to me citing his O positive blood group,” said Aziz who is currently recuperating from the third kidney transplant. 
 
 Firoz, who has acted as villain in three Gujarati films including the hit-film ‘Radha Tara Vina Mane Gamtu Nathi’, said he believes in true love and is not a typical conservative father. “I had told Shaheen and Aziz that I will be there for them and I have honoured my promise. My son-in-law is my best friend, my buddy, my partner in crime. I can go to any lengths for him,” Firoz, who also runs a glass business apart from acting, told TOI. 
 
 Aziz, 35, recalled that he first underwent a transplant in 2005 after his kidney stopped functioning due to a condition called urinary reflux. His mother   donated him the kidney. A year later, the organ got rejected due to some complication. “I underwent dialysis for four years till doctors said I needed an organ. My sister’s kidney was not a perfect match. Luckily, I got a cadaver donor and underwent transplant in 2009,” said Aziz. “We are friends who are inseparable. I have never travelled alone and always take my papa along,” said Aziz, who lost his own father in 2012.
