PORVORIM:   Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Tuesday assured the legislative assembly that phase I of the sewerage plant facility for Benualim constituency would be completed within three months. Once phase I, estimated to cost Rs 80 crore, is ready, phase II will be taken up. The latter is expected to cost Rs 90 crore. 

 “The sewerage facility will help stop pollution in the Colva creek, after which its desilting will be undertaken,” Dhavalikar said in reply to a question tabled by   during Question Hour.
 
 Reiterating that Colva was a popular tourist destination, Alemao said the stench from the creek was a deterrent to most visitors. He said the creek was once a beautiful waterbody in which he regularly swam, “but today, the water has been polluted by   released from hotels”. He urged the government to beautify the creek urgently.
 
 Dhavalikar, in reply, said not only Colva creek but also several other nullahs and creeks across the state were in a similar condition with waste being released into them.
 
 Tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar told the House that while a beautification project for Colva had been approved with central funding in 2012, it could not be completed following a stay order by the NGT. He went on to seek the cooperation of the coastal MLAs when he said some projects planned by his department were either delayed or had to be stopped due to opposition to them. 
 
 Funds to the tune of Rs 200 crore received from the Centre under the Swadesh Darshan scheme will be utilised towards beautification of tourist areas and upgrading infrastructure, he added.
