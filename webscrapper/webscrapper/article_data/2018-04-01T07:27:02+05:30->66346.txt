MUMBAI: The slump in the real estate market has forced the state government to keep Ready Reckoner (RR) Rates unchanged.

 The order issued by the Inspector General of Registration on the last day of the current financial year states, “Taking into consideration the depressed conditions in the real estate market, the 2017-18 RR rates are to be considered for the financial year 2018-19.”
 
  
  
 
 Revenue Minister   told TOI this year the amendment in rules and the overall slowdown faced by the realty sector prompted the decision to maintain status quo in rates.
 
 “The proposal was to increase the rates by 7%. However, we decided not to increase the ready reckoner rates as they were already high,” stated Patil.
 
 Mumbai is divided into 700 zones for which RR rates are prepared annually. In the last five years, rates were increased by 6-7% annually except in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001 when the government, despite there being no amendment, had reduced the RR rates.
 
 Sunit Gupta, an expert on property valuation, said the government had missed a golden opportunity to reduce the RR rates and also to convert the area on which the stamp duty was charged from builtup to carpet.
 
 “RERA demands all flat purchase agreements be signed on carpet area but stamp duty is paid on builtup area. The government could have easily seized this opportunity to make that correction. Stamp duty rates would have automatically corrected by 10% and this would have helped the real estate market as prices too would have corrected,” he said.
 
 Builder   said the government should have kept RR rates at par with the 2016 table. “It would have helped the real estate industry to achieve sales. As it is, sales are low on account of GST which has put an additional burden on buyers,” he said.
 
  and CREDAI have been demanding a 25% reduction in RR rates since the real estate market has been depressed for the last three to four years.
