THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   state President   here on Friday accused opposition leader   of spreading false news about Lavalin case. “The opposition leader's statement that BJP has been conspiring with the CPM in   is totally baseless. He should not try to mislead public by issuing such unsubstantiated statements,“ Kummanam said.
 
 Chennithala had alleged that the BJP and the CPM were in secret pact to save Pinarayi from   case.“The additional solicitor general who appeared for the CBI has expressed willingness to proceed with the SNC Lavalin case whenever it comes up before the court. The case has been getting postponed as Pinarayi's advocate M K Damodaran has not been keeping well.It's quite natural. But the attempt to link the postponement of the case and all party meeting in Kannur point to sheer political bankruptcy,“ Kummanam said.
