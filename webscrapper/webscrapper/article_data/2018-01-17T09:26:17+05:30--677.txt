AURANGABAD: Two plots measuring about 4,000 sq ft each in a prime locality here, belonging to a former income tax commissioner, were sold off after making an Aadhaar in his name and acquiring a general power of attorney in Mumbai.

 The main suspect - Azam alias Azam Panga   Khan (49) of Aurangabad- has been arrested and remanded in police custody by a local court till January 18.
 
 The suspect was picked up from Mumbai. A hunt has been launched for his accomplices, including the one who made a fake Aadhaar card and posed as the retired I-T commissioner  .
 
 Inspector   of the economic offences wing (EOW) of   police said the retired income tax commissioner resides in Mumbai and owns the plots in Aurangabad that were sold off fraudulently.
 
 "To avoid suspicion, the suspects got the GPA registered at the Mumbai-based registrar of properties office," he said.
 
 The officer said that the gang sold off Ganveer's plots and handed over possession of plots owned by another person who resides in Surat, Gujarat. "When the owner of these plots arrived in the city, she raised a hue and cry and approached police. Soon, Ganveer was informed that the deal was done in his name."
