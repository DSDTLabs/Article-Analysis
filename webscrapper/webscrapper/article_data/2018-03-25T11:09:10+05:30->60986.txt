JAIPUR: A few days after the   constable recruitment examinations were cancelled due to widespread incidents of cheating and manipulation, the state government has appointed an inspector general (IG) level officer solely for the purpose of conducting recruitment.

 In the transfer orders issued last night, IG (planning, modernization and  ) Dr   has moved to the newly created post of IG (recruitment).
 
 Sources informed TOI that the action was taken after the state police drew flak after several cheating syndicates were busted by the special operations group (SOG) of the Rajasthan police during first phase of the recruitment examination held recently.
 
 Earlier, IG (headquarters) carried out the responsibility for conducting police recruitments. But, after the exams were cancelled to the chagrin of the government, a new wing has been set up at Rajasthan police headquarters (PHQ) for the purpose.
 
 “There was already a recruitment cell at the headquarters. The aim now is to strengthen that wing,” an official told TOI.
 
 The examination was held for the posts of 5,390 constables and nearly 16 lakh candidates appeared for it. At least, five lakh had already appeared in the first phase of the examination which was held online for the first time.
 
 The announcement came after the SOG busted gangs involved in facilitating cheating in the examination using various methods. Around 26 people have already been arrested.
 
 “Our aim is to ensure that recruitments are conducted smoothly and the process is free and fair to admit only credible and deserving candidates,” said an official, adding that they were thrashing out the details of the examination which may be held again soon.
 
 The other officers transferred yesterday were SP S K Gupta, who has been moved from intelligence   and welfare, and Dr  , who has been appointed SP (headquarters).
