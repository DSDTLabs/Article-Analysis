 “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very attached to our institution and holds us in high esteem … but we have been running from pillar to post inside the ministry of social justice for disbursal of funds,” said Swami Sarvolokananda, secretary, Ramakrishna Mission Ashram at Narendrapur, which runs the Blind Boys’ Academy, in a press conference announcing the final event of the 60th year celebrations.
 
 The academy, set up in 1957, has been holding year-long diamond jubilee celebrations, which will culminate with a two-day event on Friday. T C Gehlot, minister of social justice and empowerment, and Babul Supriyo, minister of state for emergency and library services for the visually impaired, will attend the programme.
