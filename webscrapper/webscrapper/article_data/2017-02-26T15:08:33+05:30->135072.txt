Director Sukumar has finally commenced work on his next film with Ram Charan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu! The flick that is tentatively titled 'RC11', went on floors today, with the team coming together for a special pooja ceremony.
 
 
 
Megastar Chiranjeevi also made it a point to attend the pooja this morning to bestow his blessings on his son and pray for the success of his son's latest venture.  
 
The might be just a few hours into it’s filming, but that didn't stop the makers from releasing a first glimpse of the movie. It showed a caricature of Ram Charan carrying pots on his shoulders in the backdrop of a rural setting.
