Panaji: TCP minister   Sardesai has questioned whether the “principal opposition party” was condoning Monday’s violence. He was reacting to the party’s demand for a judicial inquiry into the police lathicharge on agitators during the mining protest. 

 “Mining dependents have the right to agitate peacefully. But it cannot be ignored that the ensuing traffic congestion affected students and ailing people. Violence cannot be justified,” said Sardesai.
