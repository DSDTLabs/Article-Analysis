 is traditionally considered a complete food. In fact some studies in the past have shown that milk and milk products improve Blood Pressure (BP) and reduce   risk. But dairy products in general have been getting a lot of flak lately for thier consumption leading to an increased risk of hypertension and poor outcomes of  . Many studies have been trying to establish this connection from time to time. Many studies have connected milk consumption with high cholesterol, prostrate and ovarian cancers and even broken bones. Needless to say that milk and milk products are being considered as the villain today for heart health. 

 In a recent study, several studies with observational and experimental data were analyzed so as to come to a consensus on whether there is a link between systolic hypertension and dairy consumption. This study published in the British Medical Journal clearly negates any such connection. The study compared 22 studies with 1,71,213 participants and another 10 prospective studies with 26,119 participants; the observational data was analyzed statistically. Aging individuals with heart conditions were enrolled as subjects for this study. The major parameter considered was a nucleotide numbered rs4988235 which is related to lactase persistence. Lactase persistence is a condition where lactase keeps digesting lactose even after a child is weaned off milk in childhood.
 
 Interestingly none of these parameters, their respective variable analysis and systematic review of existing clinical trials were able to justify the inverse relationship between dairy products and Systolic Blood Pressure. Thereby, it can be stated that the healthy way to heart is independent of the milk consumption.
