PATNA: If all goes well, the land for the proposed new international   at Bihta will be handed over to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) within three months. The new airport will be a civil enclave at the existing Indian Air Force’s airbase. 

 After inspecting the site on Thursday, Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the land acquisition process has been initiated with the issuance of a notification on July 7 and public announcement on July 12 in this regard. The government will start making payments after a week, he said.
 
 Total 126 acre of 400-odd land owners has to be acquired — 99 acre in Vishambhar and 27 acre in Kultupur localities. The land owners will be paid four times the market rate of the land for which the state government has already sanctioned around Rs 270 crore, sources said.
 
 A help desk has been set up at the Patna collectorate to assist the land owners and expedite the acquisition process. “We are committed to making payments in time,” the DM said.
 
 The need of a new airport in Patna has been felt for long as the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport is considered critical because of its short runway. The runway measure only 2,286 metres, which makes the landing and take-off quite risky.
 
 A major accident was averted only recently after a Delhi-bound Indigo flight’s engine had to abort its take-off as one of its engines failed seconds before it was to go air borne. 
 
 Aviation experts said the aircraft in such circumstances face the risk of overshooting the runway, especially when it is wet due to rain.
