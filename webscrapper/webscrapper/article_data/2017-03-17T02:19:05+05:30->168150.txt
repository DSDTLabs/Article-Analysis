NEW DELHI: Ahead of the opening of Delhi Metro’s  , the Central Industrial Security Force ( ) is conducting special   in ‘soft skills’ for its personnel, which will teach them to deal with foreign travellers and tourists.

 The training will include guiding the travellers to their destination, asking them if they require any help and also giving basic tips like taking care of their baggage in crowded areas. The force, which handles the security of   stations, aims to make its personnel more ‘passenger-friendly’.
 
 “Basic soft skills are imparted to every CISF personnel at Metro stations, but this time we are focusing on the heritage line stations. A lot of travellers often require directions and may also not know which route to take. CISF personnel are being trained to guide them and also interact with them,” said a CISF official.
 
 The heritage line — part of the Phase-III Metro expansion — will connect Kashmere Gate to ITO and will have stations at Red Fort, Jama Masjid and Delhi Gate. According to CISF, the structural layout of the stations was designed keeping security in mind. However, a large footfall is expected at the new stations that will include foreign tourists and CISF personnel will need to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. “This will help them deal with passengers in a more dignified manner. This is likely to enhance the passenger experience,while ensuring security,” said a CISF official.
