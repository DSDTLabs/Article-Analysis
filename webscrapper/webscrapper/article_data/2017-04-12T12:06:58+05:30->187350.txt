KARWAR:   (in pic), who was acquitted by a   court on Monday in an alleged terror link case, spoke about the nightmare he went through in the past decade after his arrest.

 At his residence in   on Tuesday, Shabbir said he had been arrested only because he hailed from Bhatkal town and was a moulana.
 
  “My entire family had to face sorrow and hardship,” said Shabbir.
 
 He said he was first arrested by the anti-terror squad of   police in 2008 and he was named as an accused in the   of 2010. “I was in jail when the blast took place in Bangaluru and despite that I was named in the case,” he said.
 
 He said police came knocking on his door at midnight and took him him with his uncle. ‘I was subjected to third-degree torture. They kept asking about the location of the absconding   (  and  ). They beat me till I fainted,” he said. 
 
 When police could not find evidence against him, they implicated him in a false case of counterfeit currency, he alleged. 
 
 “I have already spent 10 years in jail as an undertrial, but will seek justice from the high court and pray that I’ll be acquitted here too,” Shabbir said.
 
 “The Supreme Court directed the subordinate court to complete the trial in a year, so I was acquitted. Otherwise, I would have spent many more years in jail,” he said. Requesting youths to stay away from terrorists, he said he was proud of the Indian judicial system and also for being an Indian because truth had triumphed. He said the public should come forward to help all Muslims falsely implicated in cases.
 
 Arshad Belur, the advocate who had argued his case, stated that the court has released him after verifying the evidence and thanked the judiciary for helping to uphold the truth.
