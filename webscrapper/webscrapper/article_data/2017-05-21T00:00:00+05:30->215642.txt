She may be one of the most-wanted heroines in the country today, but   still a simple, god-fearing girl at heart. The actor, who has garnered popularity for her portrayal of   in the   series, made her way to the temple town of Kollur on Friday evening along with her family. Accompanied by mother Prafulla, brother   and social activist-politician Muthappa Rai,   arrived at Kollur without sounding an VIP alert and also stood in line with other devotees for the evening aarti. 
“Sweety (as she’s called at home) has always been pious and a very religious girl. The Mookambika temple is one of her favourites and she had gone there even while shooting for her Rajinikanth-starrer Lingaa in near-by Sagar. It was her wish to offer thanks to the goddess for the tremendous response to the film,” shares her father Vittal Shetty. He adds, “Since she's been busy with work, it’s been a while since   came home. So when she managed to find some free time, she quickly came to Bengaluru, spent some quality time with us after which she wished to go to Kollur. She flew back to Bengaluru soon after her temple visit and onwards to Hyderabad as she had to report for the shoot of her upcoming Telugu film, Bhagmati,” sums up Vittal.
