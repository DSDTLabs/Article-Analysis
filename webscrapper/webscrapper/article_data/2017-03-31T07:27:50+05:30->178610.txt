 “ Food and civil supplies minister UT Khader on Thursday told reporters the food preparation and supply contract will not be given to Iskcon. Asked if the no-garlic-no-onion policy was the reason, Khader said: “We want to make the food at the Indira Canteens tasty . We'll hold discussions with hoteliers, caterers and NGOs about this.“
 
 A source in the bureaucracy said: “The food in the Indira Canteens should sync with the tastes and preferences of the common man.“ Khader said a centralized kitchen will start in each assembly segment in Bengaluru and food will be supplied to the Indira Canteens. “To start with, we'll offer food to 200250 people at subsidized rates in these canteens. Depending on the response, we'll scale up our operations,“ Khader added.
