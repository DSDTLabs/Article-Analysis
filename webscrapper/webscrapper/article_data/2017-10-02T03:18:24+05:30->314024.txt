 A woman, battling humiliation in the absence of a toilet at her home, dragged her father-in-law to the police station and allegedly forced him to sign a bond that he would get one constructed soon.
 
  The incident took place at   village in   of   district.
  
  The officer in-charge of women’s police station at Muzaffarpur, Jyoti said the woman had submitted a written complaint on September 25 against her father-in-law and brother-in-law for turning a deaf ear to her constant pleas for a toilet at home.
  
  Because of this hardship, she would come to her marital home only when her husband returned from his workplace in Tamil Nadu. She had shifted to her father’s house after her husband went back to his workplace.
  
  Finding no solution to her woes, she gave a written complaint to the police against her father-in-law and brother-in-law, who were called to the police station on September 26, Jyoti said.
  
  The two relented before police and the father-in-law signed a bond that a toilet would be constructed at home soon.
  
  “We asked them to do it in one week, but they pleaded for some more time to arrange money. After the compromise was reached, the woman withdrew her complaint,” Jyoti added.
