Surat: A woman BJP worker submitted a written application to city police commissionerâ€™s office here seeking action against a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader on Saturday for sexually exploiting and threatening her. The woman, who is a resident of Adajan area in the city, alleged that the person was threatening her with an acid attack as he wanted her to discontinue relationship with him. 

 She claimed in her application that she came in touch with the BJYM general secretary since her husband is also a BJP worker. She used to stay in touch with him through Facebook and phone and slowly the two got into physical relationship. Of late, he was pressurising and threatening her to end the relationship. 
 
 The BJYM leader had allegedly got some water bottles thrown at her residence to instil a fear of an acid attack in her. The woman submitted another application on Monday alleging that she was sexually exploited by the BJYM leader, who had promised to give her a good post in the party. She alleged that some other BJP leaders too were putting pressure on her and her husband to withdraw the application given to the police. She has demanded police protection from him.
