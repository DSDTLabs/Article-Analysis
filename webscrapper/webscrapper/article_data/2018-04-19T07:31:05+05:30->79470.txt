QUEPEM: The power department is in the process of allocating a standby transformer at   sub-station and mobile transformers in towns all over the state, following the recent, disastrous 36-hour blackout at   and surrounding areas after the main 6.3MVA transformer at Xeldem failed.

 Chief electrical engineer N   said his department will submit a requisition to the government for this facility as a permanent solution. Xeldem sub-station’s 6.3 MVA transformer will cost around Rs 80 lakh. “After installing the new transformer, we will keep both in use by sharing load equally, but one can be put on full load in case the other fails,” said Reddy.
 
 “The department will acquire more mobile transformers and keep standbys in every town to tackle emergencies. At present, only a few towns, like Curchorem, have mobile transformers,” the chief electrical engineer also said.
 
 Late on Saturday night, angry protesters went on a rampage and set ablaze three scrap transformers outside the Quepem electricity department’s office, over the department’s inaction to restore electricity through alternate lines. A delegation led by former Quepem municipal council chairperson   along with councillor   met Reddy near Xeldem sub-station and demanded the immediate installation of a standby transformer and provision of a mobile transformer in town to face power failures.
