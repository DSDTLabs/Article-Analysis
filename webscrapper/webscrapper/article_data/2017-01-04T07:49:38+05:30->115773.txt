MUMBAI:   Jadhav, a final-year BAF student who is feared drowned in the Ganges at Hrishikesh on Monday, was apparently trying to save his friend Vinay  , but both were swept away by strong currents, the local police said quoting eye-witnesses.

 The rescue team is still searching for the two students (both in their early 20s) of B Com Accounts and Finance (BAF) at Thakur College of Science and Commerce. Low temperature and depth of the river have made the search difficult, said Ram Kumar Saini, the station house officer at Muni Ki Reti.
 
 The duo were part of a trip organized by a large group of students ­ most of them said to be Facebook friends--belonging to colleges across the city .Besides Shetty and Jadhav, two other boys and three girls from their class were part of the trip to   for New Year celebrations. Other students were from Thakur College of Engineering and Technology, NM College too.
 
 The team had reached Ris hikesh on Sunday from Nainital. Saini said the incident happened when a batch of 10 students went for river rafting. “Half the batch had left the place, while a few students waited on the bank. We were told that Vinay and Karan knew basics of swimming. They jumped a couple of times, and the current swept Vinay away when he jumped for the third time and Karan followed him,“ the officer said.
 
 Chaitaly Chakraborty, principal of the college, said Shetty and Jadhav were bright in academics and extracurricular activities. “They represented the college in several inter-collegiate competitions and won prizes. Most of the students from their class are in shock. It is really unfortunate,“ said the principal.
 
 A college official said the final-year BAF was slated to visit Manali and Nainital on January 6, but these students had not given their consent for the trip.
 
 Many classmates were in college till evening waiting for information about the duo.“We are unable to establish contact with the remaining students,“ said a classmate.
