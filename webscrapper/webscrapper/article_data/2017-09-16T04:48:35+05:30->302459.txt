NEW DELHI: Vice President M   on Friday hit out at dynastic politics, saying dynasty in democracy is “nasty”, days after   talked about the phenomenon being present in the Indian system. 

 “There is discussion about dynasty. Dynasty and democracy cannot go together. Very simple... it weakens our system. Dynasty in democracy is nasty,” he said at a book launch but added that his remarks were not linked to any party. He said he used to voice similar views earlier too but now he hesitates as he is out of politics. 
 
 Naidu, however, made it clear that he is not referring to any political party while speaking against dynasty. “I am not keeping in mind any particular party — this party or that party — as someone said everybody is trying to follow each other.” 
 
 Speaking at the  , Rahul had earlier this week said that dynasties are commonplace in India, from politics to business, and stressed that a person’s capabilities are more important than pedigree. “Most parties in India have that problem,” Rahul had said.
