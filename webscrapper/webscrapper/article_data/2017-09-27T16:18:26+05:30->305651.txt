 Many consider ‘Ghatasthapana’ as one of the most important rituals in Navratri. Here, an urn is filled with water and placed in front of the Goddess Durga’s idol. This ritual symbolises the invocation of the goddess and may vary from community to community. The muhurat will begin from 6:13am to 8:10am on September 21.
 
 Another important ritual is of ‘Akhand Diya’, where the lamp is kept lit round the clock, throughout the nine days. People start their fast after this ritual and offer prayers to the goddess for nine consecutive days.
 
 On the tenth day, nine girls are worshipped at home, and they represent the nine goddesses that are worshipped during Navratras. Apart from offering prayers to the deity, these girls are served food, after which the devotees break their fast.
