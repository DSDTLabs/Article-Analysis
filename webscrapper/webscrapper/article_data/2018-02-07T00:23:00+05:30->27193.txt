Pune: PMPML on Tuesday announced two AC Volvo buses on two new routes — one from the Pune station to Hinjewadi Phase-3 and another from Hadapsar to Nigdi. 

 Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) officials said the move aimed at encouraging IT professionals and the upper middle class people to use public transport buses. 
 
 Though over 12 lakh people avail of PMPML buses daily, there was a big section who avoid the vehicles. Ashok Nagarjun (31), who works with an IT firm at Hinjewadi, travels each day to his workplace on his bike. “I am not convinced with the idea of availing of PMPML buss. The idea may be good, but I will first take feedback from friends who might be using the service before trying it,” he said.
 
 “I am worried about the timings. I have heard that the PMPML buses are never on time. That is dangerous for our job,” IT professional Senthil Singha said.
