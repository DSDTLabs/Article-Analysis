ABBIGERI (Ron):   national president  , who was to lunch with a farmer’s family in Abbigere village, skipped his visit on Thursday in view of the model code of conduct ahead of polls.

 
 The Naduvalgudda family, waiting eagerly for Shah to come home after a public event, was sorely disappointed. At the last minute, Shah decided against having lunch as he was told it would amount to violation of the poll code. Accompanied by state BJP president   and others, he headed to Gadag.
 
 When news reached the Naduvalgudda family and the crowd of villagers at the farmer’s house, there was total disappointment. A visibly upset Sridevi, the daughter-in-law, and Shekamma, head of the household, said: “We had prepared shenga holige, yellu holige, roti, chapatti, brinjal and other   items. We spent two sleepless nights to make these arrangements. Though we are not BJP workers, some party leaders requested us to arrange for lunch in our house,” they added.
 
 Expecting Shah to have his meal there, the Election Commission’s flying squad visited the house to seize the food and take stock of the situation. This led to heated arguments between the family members, villagers and election officers. An officer was taken to task for entering the house, and sent out.
 
 G M Gonal of the Gadag flying squad said: “Food was prepared to serve the leaders without taking permission. Usually, permission is not given to serve food as it is a violation. If it is for 8 to 10 family members, it is permissible, but they had prepared food for more than 15 members.”
 
 Gonal said the family had taken permission orally, saying leaders like Shah and others would visit their house for lunch. “The leaders may have skipped it after realizing it violates the model code of conduct. We have not filed a case, but will bring it to the notice of our seniors,’’ he added.
