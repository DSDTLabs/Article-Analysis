To give a boost to the game of chess, supposed to have originated in India, the Department of Physical Education of St. Albert’s College, Kochi, recently came up with a summer vacation chess festival and coaching camp, with an intention of helping students identify and enhance their talents in chess.

 “The aim is not to win a championship but to promote chess as a tool for overall development. It improves concentration, helps memory retention and above all, reflexes of children,” says M B Muralidharan, former Kerala State Champion and national player. The highlight of the camp was that it was held under the guidance of an expert team consisting of Indian coaches, national players, state champions and university players. There was also a grooming session which involved meditation and concentration enhancement.
 
 The camp began with mind exercises to test the reflexes of the participants. “I believe it has helped me boost my logical reasoning ability to a great extent,” says Parvathy, a student. The camp, lasting 45 days, was conducted in three batches. School and college students could be seen split into groups based on their level of knowledge.
 
 A speciality of chess is that children can start playing from a very young age, says Muralidharan. “For most other sports, the students have to grow up to be physically fit. Chess needs little investment.”
 
 “The alumni of the college played the most important role in the initiation of the camp,” says Sajeev Jose, Head of the Dept of St. Albert’s. In fact, some of the alumnae came to college to offer coaching. “It feels amazing to get back to my campus and teach a game I was actively involved in during my college days,” says Nithin VV, an alumnus and coach.
