CHANDIGARH: The police have registered an   against a Sector 17-based footwear outlet for not passing goods and services tax (GST) benefit to a consumer and violating orders passed under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr PC).

 On March 7, SDM (centre) Virat has asked Sector 17 SHO to registering a case of disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant under Section 188 of the IPC.
 
 Advovate   had accused   shoes of violating the order by not passing on the tax benefit to consumers. In his complaint, Jagga had alleged he purchased a shoe polish at Rs 99 instead of Rs 91.26, with shop not passing on the benefit of reduced taxes by the GST council on November 10, 2017.
 
 The administration had issued an order under Section 144 of the CrPC prohibiting the sale of notified commodities without passing the benefits of reduced taxes to consumers. In the order, the administration had termed denial of benefits of reduction of tax as “unjustified costs” imposed on consumers, which is restricted under Section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
 
 In its defence, the counsel who had appeared for the outlet said they were not aware of the notification. The counsel said the district magistrate is not competent authority to issue the order.
