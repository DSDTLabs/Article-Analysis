CHENNAI: A new set of   announced by the   of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry has stirred a hornet’s nest within the legal fraternity, as it is seen as having been designed to keep several strong contenders out of the fray.

 On January 24, the special committee mandated to conduct the day-to-day affairs of the council, besides holding elections by March-end, adopted the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Conduct of Election Rules, by invoking the powers conferred under Section 8-A, Section 15 and all other enabling provisions.
 
 While rules such as the one requiring at least 10 years of continuous practice as fundamental eligibility, further toughened by the condition that they should have filed at least 10 cases in the five preceding years, have been welcomed by lawyers, the one seeking to prevent lawyers holding positions in political parties from contesting in Bar council polls has enraged the fraternity.
 
 “Every political party has a lawyers wing, and lawyers are the biggest single block of professionals among Tamil Nadu’s MLAs and MPs,” said a former member of Bar council, requesting anonymity. “Seeking to prevent ‘founder’ of political party from contesting in Bar council polls is ridiculous, and it is seen as targeting a couple of influential lawyers who are potential candidates this time,” said a senior law officer.
 
 While blocking entry of lawyers who have been convicted or   is welcome, extending the prohibitory rule to those   and   at the very basis of legal profession, said a lawyer, himself fighting a case in a city court. “Till found guilty, all are presumed innocent. That is the foundation of advocacy. A lawyer facing trial could emerge unscathed at the end of the exercise. Viewing him as a convict and preventing his entry into poll fray is unfair,” said president of a lawyer’s forum.
 
 Lawyers, however, unanimously welcome the new rule specifically banning corrupt poll practices.
