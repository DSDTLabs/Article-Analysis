Actress   said people have misconception about   and consider it a battle between men and women. The actress, who is gearing up for the release of her superhero film ' ', said her character in the film is definitely a feminist, who is equal to men. 

  
  
 "I think people have a misconception about what feminism is. People think hairy armpits and women who burn bras and hate men. That's not it. For me, feminism is all about equality and freedom and (women) choosing what we want to do. If it's salaries, then we get paid equal to men. It's not men vs. Women or women vs. Men," Gadot said. 
 
 The 32-year-old Israeli star's opinion on feminism helped her in brining alive the iconic superhero on the screen. 
 "It was important to me that my character would never come and preach about how men should treat women. Or how women should perceive themselves. It was more about playing oblivious to society's rules. 'What do you mean women can't go into the  ? Why?,'"she said. 
 
 "It's just reminding everyone how things should be. I wanted to play the fish out of water, but I didn't want to play her too silly," she added. 'Wonder Woman' will hit the theaters on June 2.
