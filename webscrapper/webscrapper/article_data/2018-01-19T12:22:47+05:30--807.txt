MYSURU: “Migrate, Educate and Experience. If you want to fly, give up everything that weighs you down,” was the message written by Priyanka M on an impression of a footprint made on a white cloth at the Bahuroopi- National Theater Festival.

 Priyanka, a second year journalism student of Mahajana’s College, says it was a unique experience.
 
 The cloth is a piece of art being made by artist   and is based on the theme of migration. The nearly 40 metre-long white cloth has more than 175 footprints which have written messages in them. When asked about why he was collecting footprints, Pramod said, “Most of the artists and the visitors who take part in   (Rangayana) are migrants. So, I thought of creating a memory out of it.”
 
 “The piece named ‘The Great Migratory Path, will have messages on migration and life. I will collect footprints till the cloth is 100 metres long. Once it is completed, it will be displayed in Rangayana,” he added.
 
 Bhargavi, a lecturer who visited Rangayana with her students, imprinted her foot on the cloth with a message ‘migration to empowerment’. She told TOI, “It is a unique concept that makes you wonder. Migration is something that can be applied to all living beings. For humans, it is about moving from place to place to get an education, learn a new culture and in total getting empowered.”
