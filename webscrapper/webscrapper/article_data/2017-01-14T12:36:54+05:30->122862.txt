PANAJI: Bharatiya   (BJP) state president   on Friday said that the final list of around eight candidates for next month’s assembly elections is likely to be released on Sunday.

 Speaking to reporters, Tendulkar said that the parliamentary board hasn’t completed the exercise and the final list would be announced on Sunday.
 
 Sources reasoned that the delay in announcing the final list is probably a strategy in damage control, as aspirants and sitting MLAs may resign from the party and file their nomination as independent candidates.
 
 BJP is likely to deny a ticket to speaker and Mayem MLA Anant Shet and sports minister and Canacona MLA Ramesh Tawadkar. Sources said that the party wants to field former Congress candidate Pravin Zantye from Mayem constituency and former Canacona MLA Vijay Pai Khot from Canacona.
 
 Tendulakar said that the party is yet to decide on whether it would support Navelim independent candidate   or not. He also said that the ruling party hasn’t made up its mind to field a candidate in Benaulim and Nuvem.
