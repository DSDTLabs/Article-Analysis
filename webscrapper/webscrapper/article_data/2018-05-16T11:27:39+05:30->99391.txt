LUDHIANA: A team of the   on Tuesday inspected a support wall of the   flyover which had collapsed on Sunday night. 

 The   team took measurements of the damaged portion and checked whether there was damage to any other part of the flyover. An official said the decision on how to go about repairs would be taken on Wednesday. “We will have to take a calculated decision because this flyover is a part of the proposed elevated road project from Samrala Chowk to   octroi post,” said the official.
 
 MC superintending engineer (bridges and roads) Dharam Singh said they would be looking for a repair method which would save time and be effective in the long term.
 
 
 
 
 There was no reprieve for commuters who usually use the flyover. Long queues of vehicles were visible from Preet Cinema to Gill Chowk. Even Partap Chowk was crowded because of the movement of buses. Residents were also caught in a traffic jam near Vishwakarma Chowk, as they tried to reach Jagraon Bridge. Traffic was slow even on Railway Station Road, as people preferred this road instead of Jagraon Bridge.
 
 
 
 
 MC additional deputy commissioner (development)   met members of the four-member panel which has formed to probe into the wall of Gill Chowk flyover collapsing. Officials have been told to visit the site and submit a report as soon as possible.
