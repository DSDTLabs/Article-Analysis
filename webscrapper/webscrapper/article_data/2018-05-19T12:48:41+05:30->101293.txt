 Kunal thanked Sheshadri, the head of the Naivedyam division, for increased sale of the ‘prasad’ last fiscal.
 
 “Naivedyam is going to change for better. At present, we make ghee from the cream melted in our presence. Though it is 100% pure, it is not so tasty as the pure cow ghee is prepared in the south. The ghee, which is used in preparing laddoos at Tirupati, is now being obtained directly from Karnataka Milk Cooperative Federation. The rate of Sudha ghee here is Rs 470 per litre and the rate of the ghee which we receive now Rs 414 per litre, including transportation and GST. It is cheap because we are getting it at the rate of its supply to the   temple,” Kunal said.
 
 The Naivedyam is sold at Rs 250 per kg. “The same rate will continue for the new Naivedyam made of pure ghee,” he added.
