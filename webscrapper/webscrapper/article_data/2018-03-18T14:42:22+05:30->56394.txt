A lot of appreciation poured in for   as soon as the teaser of Aniket Chattopadhyay’s Kabir was on the social media. “I have no words to thank all who liked my character   in the teaser. Both Dev and I actually have no dialogues in the teaser. Whatever we wanted to convey, we did through our body language and expressions. And I am really grateful that everyone liked it,” said the actress. She further added that it was rather difficult to get into Yasmin’s character as there was no reference point. "Before even reading the script, Aniketda and I built up the character through our basic intelligence and logic. I was asked not to visit any parlour one month before the shoot so that he gets that worn out look which was needed for the character. In the entire film, my only makeup was the surma in my eyes,” said Rukmni.
