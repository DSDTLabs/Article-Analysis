CHENNAI: Members of the  , who have been protesting since Monday regarding anomalies in the pay scales, called off their strike on Thursday after assurances from the government authorities. 

 Also, results of the higher secondary exams may not be affected as higher secondary class teachers who had earlier boycotted the evaluation process began toning down protests in the state from Wednesday.
 
 Joint Action Committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers Association’s P K Ilamaran said the majority of the teachers were not boycotting the evaluation but would continue to protest in other ways. 
 
 Several protesting teachers had earlier demonstrated outside select evaluation centres in districts but have decided to go ahead with the marking in view of the students’ futures, members said. The Madras high court too had earlier warned the government against delay in evaluation of results for TN students.
 
 Secondary grade teachers who have discontinued their hunger strike meanwhile said that although their demands were yet to be met, they were banking on the assurance given by school education minister  . 
 
 “The minister has said that all the complaints would be taken up by the one-man committee [set up for the purpose] and will be addressed. In light of this, we have decided to call off the protests,” said  , secretary of the association.
 
 The agitating teachers, believed to be more than 21,000 in strenght, have been attacking the pay anomalies in the system and demanding equal pay for equal work. 
 
 The teachers said that the difference in pay had to be equalised as all those teachers who joined before June 2009 were drawing a basic salary of Rs 8,370 a month while those who joined later were getting a basic of Rs 5,200 a month under the 6th pay commission recommendations. They have been demanding that the government intervene and fulfil their charter of demands that includes scrapping of the contributory pension scheme.
