NAGPUR: It seems that there is no end to the unauthorized constructions in Empress Mall. The   (NMC) fire and emergency services department has identified over 30 temporary unauthorized stalls at the mall.

 Following a fire incident of Sunday, chief fire officer   along with fire officials and personnel of   fire station conducted inspection of the mall.
 
 Uchake told TOI notice to the mall’s developer   and Industries Limited will be issued in a couple of days. “We inspected G+four floors of the mall. Around 10-12 temporary stalls have been established on ground, first and third floors. All these stalls are installed in passages. Directives will be given to remove all these stalls through notice,” he said.
 
 Fire had broke out in an unauthorized temporary stall on Sunday as per the fire department’s report. An official from the fire department said electric short circuit was the cause for the fire. “The stall was established around a week ago. There seems some problem in laying electric line or related infrastructure at the stall that caused short circuit,” he said.
 
 The official added   has installed fire systems in 34 of 39 shops that were declared unsafe in March. “All 39 shops did not have the requisite fire systems. KSL Industries complied with the notice. Works are going in remaining five shops,” he said.
 
 Uchake and his team also found dumps of waste in passages, abandoned shops, staircases etc that can cause fire and also help spreading it.
 
 The mall is already shrouded with controversy for various types of unauthorized activities, residential flat schemes, IT building, open spaces and upcoming hotel building.
