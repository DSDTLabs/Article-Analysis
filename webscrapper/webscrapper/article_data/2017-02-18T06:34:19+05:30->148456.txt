HYDERABAD: In a significant decision, the   has given permission to the   to fix the rental price for  , in which the 129 newly-sanctioned schools would be accommodated, based on the prevailing market rates in each location.

 “We are searching for buildings to accommodate the 129 minority residential schools. We are looking for a minimum of 25,000 square feet built-up space. Buildings which have more built-up space with playground facilities would also be taken up on rental basis. We are confident of starting these schools in June, that is, the ensuing academic year,” said A K Khan, advisor to the government on minorities affairs. In   alone, 32 new minority residential schools are to be set up this year.
 
 Officials said flexibility in finalising the rent is important as the government had last fixed the rate for hiring buildings in 2011. No revision was done despite the prices shooting up. “Also, the rental market varies from one town to the other and from one building to other depending upon its location. It took a lot of effort on part of officers to convince the government to be flexible in finalising rentals,” said a senior official.
