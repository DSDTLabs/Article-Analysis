SRINAGAR: The BJP, which is part of Jammu and Kashmir’s ruling coalition led by the PDP, plans to set up a department in the state to counter radicalisation of youth, which the party says is the root cause of the current political situation in the valley.
 
  BJP spokesperson and   Project Construction Corporation vice chairman Khalid Jehangir said he was surveying various de-radicalisation models operational in different countries and would soon submit a proposal on it to chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and Union home minister  .
  
  "Earlier there used to be a social welfare department, but now the government has to concentrate on radicalisation counselling," Jehangir told ET. The Singapore model of de-radicalisation and rehabilitation, he said, was one of the most viable models to follow for the state.
  
  "We have seen many secular and even Muslim countries opening these kind of centres and it is giving good results. Simultaneously, we have to make our police force and security agencies more effective in countering the radicalisation by people who propagate the inhuman nature of religion," Jehangir said.
  
  The process, the BJP leader said, would involve identifying radicalised youth or those who have the potential to get brainwashed. Instead of putting them in jail, these youth would be put for a certain period in some isolated centres where doctors, religious scholars and security experts would counsel them. After being released, they would be put under strict surveillance.
  
  "Anybody who is acceptable to society should head the department and work in tandem with the administration. Youth here are being radicalised, especially in South Kashmir, by the people who have close contacts with outfits like Lashkar and Jama’at ud Dawa," Jehangir said.
  
  The challenge for the government in J&K, according to the BJP, is to develop the state and also have a counter mechanism and counter narrative for radicalisation.
