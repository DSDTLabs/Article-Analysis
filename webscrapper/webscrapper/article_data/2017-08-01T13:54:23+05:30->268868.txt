NAGPUR: Unless it rains heavily in August and September, the city may face water scarcity next summer.  , which is a major source of water supply to the city, is only 11% full even after two months of rainy season. Last year the dam was 70% full in July end.

 A   ( ) official said that the storage capacity of   was 1,017 million cubic metres (mm3). “On the morning of July 31, the dam had only 113 mm3 water, which is worrying. The catchment area of the reservoir in Chhindwara and Seoni districts of Madhya Pradesh have not received sufficient rainfall this year. The rainfall in the district has also been far lower than the average,” he added.
 
 The average storage of last five years is 561 mm3. The lowest during this period was in 2012 when the dam had only 264 mm3 water in July end. In 2013, the dam had 934 mm3.
 
 The condition of other major dams in Nagpur division is no better either. The eighteen dams including Totladoh have total 650 mm3 water which translates to 22% storage. The average of last five years is 1,658 mm3. The lowest was in 2012 when these dams had 980 mm3. This year, Dina reservoir in Gadchiroli has the best storage at 70%. The Irai dam that supplies water to 3,000 MW Chandrapur Super Thermal   (CSTPS) has only 37% water. 
 
 The storage in 40 medium-sized reservoirs in the division is also a cause for worry. The average figure for July end is just 21%. They have total 115 mm3 water against an average figure of 303 mm3 in the last five years.
