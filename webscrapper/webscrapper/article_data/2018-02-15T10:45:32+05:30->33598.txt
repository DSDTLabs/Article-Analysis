ITANAGAR: Arunachal Pradesh   Committee (APCC) president Takam Sanjoy has asked why the special category status (SCS) granted to Arunachal, under Article 371(H) by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has been withdrawn by the   government. "Like Nagaland and Mizoram,   was granted SCS considering the sensitivity of the situation and its proximity to the international border. This ensured 30% planned expenditure as subsidy unlike the 10% to other states and Union territories. Why has this status been withdrawn?" Sanjoy said. 

 "PM   this time will certainly announce numerous sops, as he did while attending the statehood day celebration here in 2015. But that will not amount to much as we have seen in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh," he added, claiming that PM Modi dealt a heavy blow to the northeast by withdrawing the special category status, which took away the North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy that offered a central capital investment subsidy of 30% to investors and other subsidies like the PDS. This has stalled the development of the state, Sajoy claimed.
