 The civic body, however, said the plan could not be carried out in the early hours of Wednesday as the civic chief D M Mugalikar was called to Mumbai on an urgent meeting. He had to apprise the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and other authorities of the high court order on removal of illegal religious  . 
 
 In 2008, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had submitted a list of 1,101 illegal and unauthorised shrines that were coming in the way of road widening before the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court. The move came following a suo moto public interest litigation.
 
 While passing the recent order, the court took a strong view of non-compliance of its earlier 2008 order. It warned the AMC chief and the police commissioner of contempt of court if they fail to initiate any action.
 
 On Tuesday, the municipal commissioner declared that the AMC with the help of police would launch the drive against these structures from Wednesday. He had also formed four squads for the purpose. 
 
 However, he along with mayor Bhagwan Ghadamode were forced to rush to Mumbai on Wednesday morning. They also added that the civic chief was likely to come back by late Wednesday evening, while the squad he had set up and other officials were ready to carry out the high court orders. The action is set to start late on Wednesday night.
 
 In the meantime, Shiv Sena district unit on Wednesday made a representation to the divisional commissioner against the AMC complaining that the civic body has not properly prepared a list of shrines that were being dubbed as a hindrance to the road widening work.
 
 District unit president Ambadas Danve, said that temples were built long before the AMC came into existence and the civic body should have properly prepared the development plan accordingly, he added.
