ALLAHABAD: Shankaracharya Swami Narendranand Saraswati of   on Tuesday said governments should focus more on bringing normalcy in the state of Jammu and Kashmir and giving relief to farmers than engaging in vote bank politics. 

 The seer was in the city to perform ‘bhumi pujan’ for his pandal in the upcoming Magh mela. 
 
 “South Kashmir is burning for the past six months. There has not been a single day when security forces have not faced attacks from terrorists from other side of the border or from our own misguided youths. Why the state or Central governments are not identifying and nabbing those people who are pushing Kashmiri youngsters into subversive activities?” said the Shankarcharya. 
 
 He said rest of the country is being kept in dark about the state of affairs in Kashmir. “There is an urgent need to bring normalcy in the area. We cannot afford to lose our soldiers in a confrontation with our own misguided people,” he added. 
 
 Commenting on the recent statement of Prime Minister   of rabi crops sowing increasing by 6%, he said, “Governments should also tell people why farmers of Maharashtra,  ,  , Uttar Pradesh and in   are forced to throw their produce of gourd, tomato, potato, onion, pumpkin into farm fields.”
 
 He said farmers in some areas have left their produce in fields for people to take them free of cost due to low minimum support price offered to them by the government and the high cost of productivity. 
 
 “Farmers have to suffer under any government. To think that farmers have benefited a lot from demonetisation and their produce will increase is a gross miscalculation and I don’t know from where the governments came out with such figures,” he added.
