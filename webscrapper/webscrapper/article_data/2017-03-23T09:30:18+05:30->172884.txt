THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Following allegations of laxity on the part of forest officials in handling  , forest minister   has directed the officials to ensure   during such instances. 

 "Several complaints have been raised against forest officials. It has been often said that they were the last people to reach the spot whenever an attack by wild animals, especially elephants, takes place. The department should ensure speedy action by personnel from   (VSS), eco-development committees (EDC)s and forest watchers," he said.
 
 The minister was addressing top forest officials at the department headquarters on Wednesday, at a function to launch the renovated website of the department. Atlases and pocket maps of various forest divisions and wildlife territories were distributed to the field staff during the ocassion. Raju also stressed the need for scientific construction of bunds and check dams inside the forests. 
 
 He said such measures would discourage wild animals from straying into areas inhabited by humans besides helping in dousing wildfire.
 
 Meanwhile, the revamped website of the forest department has been designed in such a way to speed up the services offered to public. The features include details of eco-tourism centres, forest produces and new schemes.
