CHENNAI:   and adjacent areas near Tidel Park and   are sore with the authorities of the two IT parks. First, the two entities used barricades to stop them from using the service lane from  . Now they propose to declare it a one-way stretch, a decision that should be taken by the traffic police.

 If it reaches fruition, the proposal, circulated to employees of all software companies in Tidel Park, will mean Kanagam residents will have to spend at least an hour on the road travelling more than 3km to reach Thiruvanmiyur via Madhya Kailash junction. It takes just five minutes through the service lane. A circular to the software companies in Tidel Park said the authorities thought up the plan to benefit motorists headed to the parks. Thought of as a temporary arrangement, it could become a permanent fixture if popular, it said.
 
 The authorities seem to assume that a majority of the employees go via Madhya Kailash and less than 20% go towards Thiruvanmiyur, ECR, and Velachery. The authorities of Ramanujam IT City are also part of this plan, some residents of Kanagam alleged. 
 
 Social activist K R ‘Traffic’ Ramaswamy, the crusader for the residents of Kanagam, claimed it was the plan of a ‘dictatorship’.
 
 “They earlier put up iron poles on the middle of the service lane restricting residents. I helped remove them,” he said.
 
 Kanagam resident Panneerselvam said everyone in the locality cheered when the government built Tidel Park. “We took pride in it. Not any more. The authorities of the park are now forcing us to waste time on protests and spend more on fuel,” he said.
 
 Panneerselvam had moved the Madras high court seeking the ‘opening of the median’ to allow vehicles to cross over from Kalikundram Road. The median was kept open for a few months after OMR was opened. “ Then we started using the service lane to reach Tiruvanmiyur. Now, we have been again denied access,” he said.
