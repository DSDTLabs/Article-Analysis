PUNE: Three people succumbed to swine flu in Maharashtra, including Pune, in January, prompting state health officials to step up vaccination of high-risk individuals.

 “Five hospitalised patients tested positive for swine flu in the state this year so far. Among these, three have already succumbed to the contagion,” state surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said. The positive patients were from Pune city,  ,  , Nashik and Akola.
 
 Only throat swabs of critically ill suspected patients are sent to the   (NIV) for testing. Suspected patients, who are not critically ill, are administered oseltamivir without testing the throat swab.
 
 The year’s first death was registered in the Ahmednagar district where a 50-year-old man from the rural parts died of swine flu-induced complications at the Pravara Rural hospital in Loni on January 10.
 
 Another swine flu casualty took place in Nashik on January 25 when a 45-year-old woman from   died of the contagion at   hospital.
 
 A 17-year-old boy from Charholi in Pimpri Chinchwad (Pune) succumbed to the contagion on January 29. He was admitted to YCM hospital in Pimpri on January 25. 
 
 A total of 777 people succumbed to swine flu in Maharashtra in 2017. Of these, 148 deaths were reported from Pune city alone.
 
 Going by the analysis, the H1N1 virus hit the state harder in 2017 than the previous year (2016). Barring 2015, when the virus had claimed the maximum 905 lives, the year gone-by grappled with one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Maharashtra since 2009.
