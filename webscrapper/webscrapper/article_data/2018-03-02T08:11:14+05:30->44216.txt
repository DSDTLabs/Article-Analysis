 Solanki, who is a native of Bhavnagar settled at Rang Krupa Society, had settled in   in Bharuch for last one year. Solanki was working in a chemical company in Ankleshwar on contract basis. He had borrowed money from private lenders and invested heavily in the stock market. However, Solanki’s stock market gamble failed and he lost all the money. He was under pressure over returning the money to the lenders. However, the police have not been able to know how much money he had borrowed and from whom.
 
 On February 26, Solanki slit throats of his wife Vandana (34), son Vedant and seven-month-old daughter   before slashing his own throat using a kitchen knife. After slitting his throat, Solanki shouted for help and his landlady living on the first floor of the house came down. She called an ambulance and Solanki was rushed to   from where he was referred to SSG Hospital.
 
 The killings had sent shockwaves in the town and several questions were raised to know the reason behind it. Police had even taken statements of Solanki’s relatives who had rushed to Bharuch on knowing about the deaths but nothing much could not be known. 
 
 Cops were waiting for Solanki to gain consciousness so that the real reason could be known.
