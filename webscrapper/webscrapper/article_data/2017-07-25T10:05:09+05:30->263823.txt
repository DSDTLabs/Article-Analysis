HYDERABAD: On a day actress Charmee Kaur knocked on the doors of the High Court, the Tollywood-drug trade nexus came to the fore yet again with one more person associated with film fraternity arrested on Monday. Excise officials arrested top actress Kajal Aggarwal's manger, Puttkar Ronson Joseph alias Johnny Joseph, 38, for being in possession of four grams of dry ganja. He was arrested under the NDPS Act. 

 The excise officials raided Joseph's   residence on Monday morning. Though officials held a press conference, they did not disclose the name of the contraband seized from Joseph's house. He was reportedly manager for a few other actresses too in the past. The officials refused to comment whether Joseph, who had been Kajal Aggarwal's manager for more than a year, was an abuser or a peddler. Meanwhile,   appeared before the excise sleuths around 10.20 am on Monday. After he was questioned for about 12 hours on his links with arrested event manager-cum-drug peddler Zeeshan, the actor said he shared all the information he had. "I gave very clear answers to questions posed to me about my link with an event manager. Everything is OK,'' Navdeep told the media.
 
 The officials suspect Navdeep might have procured dope from Zeeshan, who organised events for the actor in the last few months ago. Zeeshan was arrested as he was in possession of cocaine. The officials disclosed that his phone had suspicious conversations with Navdeep. 
 
 It is learnt that Navdeep too refused to give hair and nail samples for forensic examination to ascertain whether he abused narcotic substances or not. Now, the excise officials have to approach court to seek its permission for collecting the samples.
