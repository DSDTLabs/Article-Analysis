NEW DELHI: Ajay   will continue to be the Delhi   chief as party vice-president Rahul Gandhi has reportedly asked him to withdraw his resignation. Earlier, Maken had decided to quit the post taking moral responsibility for Congress’ defeat in the civic polls. 

 “Rahul Gandhi asked me to continue in the post and work towards making the party strong. Congress saw an increase in its vote share while BJP and AAP witnessed a decline in their percentage of votes. We need to keep up the momentum,” Maken said after a meeting with the newly-elected Congress councillors. 
 
 Former MPs, MLAs and Congress’ Delhi in-charge P C Chako were among those who attended the meeting. Referring to the “crisis” in AAP, Maken said AAP was the “B” team of BJP. “AAP came out of the Anna Hazare movement, which was backed by RSS and BJP. Not only Kumar Vishwas, but CM Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia are also in connivance with BJP,” Maken alleged. He claimed that AAP had been fighting elections to cut the vote share of Congress to benefit BJP.
 
 When some party candidates claimed they had lost either due to non-cooperation from Congress workers or infighting in the party, Maken asked them to submit their complaints to the party’s disciplinary committee within two days. “The disciplinary committee will take action against those who have worked against the party,” added Maken.
