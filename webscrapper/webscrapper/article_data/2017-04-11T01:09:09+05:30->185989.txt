Noida: The Noida and   authorities have been asked to take stringent action against inoperative industrial units.

 “As per the directions of chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath, the plots of these inoperative units face cancellation, while new allotments will be made to stimulate investment in the area,”  , principal secretary (industrial development) told TOI from Lucknow.
 
 According to officials, following the directions, a list of all such units is being drawn up in the two areas. “While Noida has about 10,118 industrial units in its area, Greater Noida has 2,471 industrial units,” said Deepak Agarwal, chief executive officer, Noida and Greater Noida.
 
 “We have drawn up a list of about 150 inoperative industries in Noida and about 300 in Greater Noida. Show-cause notices have been issued and physical verification is being carried out to ensure these units are not functioning ever since they were allotted land,” Agarwal said.
 
 Agarwal further said that in many cases, the unit was functional but allottees had not taken the functional certificate. “After we issue the show-cause notices, these allottees can obtain the functional certificates by paying a penalty,” he said.
