Rajkot: Two women, whose husbands are charged with abetting suicide of a 20-year-old girl from Neelpar village in Rapar taluka of Kutch, attempted suicide at their residence in the same village on Friday night. However, the police dismissed this as ‘drama’ and an attempt to stop them from taking action against their husbands. The women, identified as Ramila Ramesh Koli and Lakshmi Kanji Koli, were shifted to Radhanpur hospital, where the doctors said their condition was stable.  According to the police, Rekha Jadeja (20) of Neelpar village, who immolated self on April 6 and succumbed to the injuries on April 13, in her dying declaration had alleged that she took the extreme step due to constant harassment and threats by persons of Koli community in her village.  Based on her statement, the police had booked Ramila’s husband Ramesh, his brothers Kanji, Jignesh and Haresh for abatement of suicide. Kanji is Lakshmi’s husband. Three days ago, the police had reached the house of Kolis to record their statements. “After recording the statement, the family members of the accused made representation to Kutch SP, alleging that the police was harassing them. The two women who attempted suicide are wives of accused Ramesh and Kanji,” police inspector V P Jadeja of Rapar police station said.  “We have yet to record statements of two women to know the reason why they had consumed kerosene,” he added.  The root of the quarrel between the Jadeja and Koli families is the murder of a Koli youth, whose body was found near Neelpar village eight months ago. Koli family had alleged that Rekha and the dead youth were having an affair and he was killed by members of Jadeja family. However, the police didn’t find any evidence in the allegation.
