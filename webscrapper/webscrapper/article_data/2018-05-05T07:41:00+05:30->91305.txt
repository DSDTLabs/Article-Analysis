Ludhiana: Swiss Military, a world renowned brand from Switzerland, has signed an exclusive deal with city-based garment manufacturer and exporter Narinder Chugh’s company Suisse A La Mode for manufacturing, marketing, and sale of garments of the Swiss company. 

 Speaking to TOI about the achievement, Chugh said: “This is a matter of pride for us and our city, as it is perhaps the first time that a global brand has tied up with a Ludhiana firm for manufacturing its products, which will be sold worldwide. Our first step will be to make Swiss Military products available at all leading multiple brand outlets, exclusive brand outlets, franchisee outlets, e-commerce platforms, and also through channels of distribution. Our plan is to launch 400 exclusive brand outlets all over India for our products.”
 
 Chugh’s other company Million Exporter Private Limited has won several export awards, including MSME Award, which was conferred to the company by textile minister Smriti Irani, and former union minister Kalraj Mishra.
