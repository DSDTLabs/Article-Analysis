ITANAGAR: A   of   (JFHGC) on Saturday called on   Kiren Rijiju and sought immediate intervention of his ministry into the assault case of Higio Gungtey. 

 Gungtey, who hails from Arunachal Pradesh and is a fourth-semester student of Christ University, was allegedly beaten up and forced to lick his house owner's shoes for using excessive water in Bengaluru on March 6. The house owner was identified as B Hemanth Kumar.
 
 While submitting a seven-point memorandum to the Union minister, the committee demanded police protection for Gungtey and arrest of Kumar. It further sought implementation of the Bezbaruah Committee recommendations. "It is a clear case of racial attack on NE people in general and Arunachal in particular," the committee said. It threatened to launch a mass protest rally if the Karnataka government fails to arrest the accused within two days.
