 Corden, who hosts "The Late, Late Show", felt like a "bomb dropped" on him when his TV comedy series "Gavin &  " took off just after he split from his long-term girlfriend  , as both events needed a lot of adjusting to.

 "There is nobody who hasn't felt a bit lost at some point. Any one of those things would be a disruption in your life. Both at the same time is just like dropping a bomb on your world," a magazine quoted Corden as saying, reports a UK news portal.
 
 However, the 39-year-old believes the changes to his life were "wonderful" in the long term.
 
 "In truth, that can be a wonderful thing for you in the long term. You've got to go and explore all the things that you might want to explore in order to find out what you really want," he said.
