PATNA: The   ( ) will set up a team of experts to find out the reasons behind sharp decline in the number of students registered for Class X and Class XII examinations this year compared to the past, its chairman   said.

 This year, 7.46 lakh candidates have registered for   compared to 12.61 lakh in 2017. Similarly, 10.5 lakh students have registered for matriculation (Class X) examination this year compared to 17.23 lakh last year. 
 
 “If we add around eight lakh students who failed last year in Class XII, the total goes to 15.46 lakh, the students appearing this year is only around 12.07 lakh, a BSEB source said.
 
 Kishor said the formation of de-duplication software might be one of the reasons. “Last year, the board installed a software called de-duplication to check those students who used to reappear in the exam with a new name by forging the birth certificates (disgraced Intermediate topper Ganesh Kumar was caught for fudging his age to reappear in exam last year). Now, the students are scared of being caught for that,” he said.
 
 “The other reason could be the disaffiliation of 200 Inter colleges and schools. Conducting a fair board exam can also be a reason,” Kishor said and added: “However, the board needs to find out where the failed students of Class X and XII have gone as around eight lakh students failed in Class XII and almost seven lakh in Class X last year.”
