JAIPUR: In the new   that the   approved on Monday, the government has granted the ‘first right of refusal’ to   if their land is e-auctioned for mining activities. Same provision will be applicable for the owners for existing mines that will go for re-tendering in near future.

 Giving more say to farmers in mining activities on their land, the government has also made it mandatory for the winning bidder to obtain no objection certificate from the land owner. This provision will be in addition to first right of refusal.
 
 “If farmers want to do mining on their land, they will have the first option to match the highest bidding amount. If they don’t, they can still negotiate a good deal with the highest bidder. This policy is much favorable for our farmers who so far were not able to reap benefits of mining activities in the state,” said Surendra Pal Singh, state minister of mines.
 
 Among other major provisions, all mines will now be auctioned after a period of 50 years. Earlier mine owners were given license for 20 years with extension of 10 more years. However, those mines that were to be auctioned in the year 2022 (completing 30 years) have received a grace period of three years and will undergo the process of re-tendering in 2025.
 
 For quarry licenses, mining period, however, will remain 30 years. The policy also proposed to reduce the lock-in period of mine transfer from two years to one year. To reduce illegal mining, policy also suggested for leaving no gap between two mines.
