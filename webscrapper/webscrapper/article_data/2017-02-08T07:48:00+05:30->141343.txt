NOIDA: The UP-STF investigating the Rs 3,700-crore Ponzi scam suspects that huge sum of money has been transferred from the accounts of Ablaze Info Solutions Pvt Ltd to some bogus company.

 The investigators found that in the early months of 2016, the company had transferred about Rs 12 crore to the accounts of a consultancy firm which dealt in providing manpower. “Our team visited the address of the consultancy firm but did not find them at the registered spot. We suspect that the money was transferred to some bogus firm, which the accused had created to siphon off the money,” an investigating official said.
 
 The investigators said the kingpin had made most transactions online and only a few cash transactions. The investigators feel that owing to demonetisation, most banks had run out of cash and hence the accused could not make cash transactions. “The online transactions are also easy for the investigators to trace,” an official said. The officials also seized a power point presentation from the Company office in which the accused had claimed that some organizations of Delhi government and Uttar Pradesh government were their clients.
 
 Meanwhile, the SIT investigating the matter has moved an application in court seeking remand of the three accused for one week. The matter has been fixed for a hearing on February 8. The police officers said that some more people associated with the company were under the scanner and their arrests were likely soon. The UPSTF has so far received around 8,000 complaints on the email id, reportfraud@upstf.com.
