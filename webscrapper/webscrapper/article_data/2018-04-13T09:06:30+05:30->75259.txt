INDORE: The story of   took an unexpected twist on Thursday when Indore-based sign language expert Gyanendra Purohit posted a ‘matrimonial ad’ for her on   — specifically looking for a “smart, deaf boy”.

 
 Purohit, who worked as interpreter for Geeta during her initial days back in India, said external affairs minister   had given him the responsibility of finding a “suitable match” for Geeta. When TOI called collector Nishant Warwade, he was taken aback and said he knew nothing about it.
 
 Geeta is in government care, under the supervision of the collector.
 
 Purohit’s Facebook post says: “Good smart Deaf boy age above 25 years. If interested in marrying Our India’s Daughter Geeta pls inform and send bio data. It will be Geeta’s decision on which government will take action.” It seeks applications on Purohit’s email and WhatsApp.
 
 “External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj is concerned for Geeta, who is yet to meet her biological parents. Sushma Ji called me for a meeting in Delhi on April 8 and assigned a new responsibility to find a suitable candidate for her,” Purohit told TOI.
 
 Collector Nishant Warwade denied having information about such a meeting and said, “There is no official communication from the ministry of external affairs.”
 
 Purohit plans to take Geeta to Jaipur and Delhi later this month to attend mass introductory meets of prospective brides and grooms.
 
 ‘We’re awaiting permission from Sushma’
 
 We are awaiting permission from Union minister Sushma Swaraj. If we don’t get the clearance, we will collect biodata of the participating candidates to show them to Geeta. If she shows interest, the candidate will be approached for further discussions,” he said.
 
 District   joint director B C Jain told TOI that he was unaware of such a request. “The department will only take any action or issue permission regarding Geeta after getting written instructions from the Union ministry of external affairs,” Jain said.
