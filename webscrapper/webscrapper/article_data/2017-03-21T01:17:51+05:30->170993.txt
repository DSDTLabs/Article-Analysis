 Lynn's name has been strongly associated with the world-famous cliffs since she released 'The White Cliffs of Dover' in 1942. 
 
 "As we look to the white cliffs today, I will be thinking of all our brave boys - the cliffs were the last thing they saw before heading off to war and, for those fortunate enough to return, the first thing they saw upon returning home," Lynn added. 
 
 The singer also celebrated the milestone by releasing a new album, becoming the first person to do so at the age of 100. 
 
 'Vera Lynn 100' features Lynn's original vocals set to re-orchestrated versions of some of her most famous songs including 'The White Cliffs of Dover' and 'Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart'.
