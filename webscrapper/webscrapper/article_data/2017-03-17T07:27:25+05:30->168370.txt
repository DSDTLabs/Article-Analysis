BENGALURU: Principal secretary to the chief minister,  , said if Bengaluru has more consumers -- people just using the city -- and fewer 'citizens' who want to participate in its growth, it is a reflection of failed urban governance. He, however, added that the issue is not unique to this city. 

 "There is no formal statute to engage citizens; public service and even politics is largely about rural areas. We're trained to be DCs (deputy commissioners/collectors in some states) in villages; we are trained to handle districts and then we find ourselves in big cities like Bengaluru," he said at a panel discussion on 'Consumer to citizen -- Engagement in urban governance," organized by   and the   on Thursday.
 
 Conceding that there isn't complete consensus on whether people need to be engaged in planning or how much of their engagement should be allowed, Atheeq said: "...Everybody agrees there must be citizen engagement for political correctness. But there is no real consensus, which again is not unique to Karnataka or Bengaluru."
 
 Just as he tried not to conceal failures at the government level, Atheeq said people in Bengaluru and most other cities in India live a life that's much more free compared to that in the West. "I lived in Washington for three years. People give up so much in those cities to ensure everything works fine. There are so many restrictions. But here we use roads as social spaces, encroach upon pavements...," he said. Atheeq felt the solution would be for the government and citizens to move closer so that governance becomes better. 
 
  Former   urged citizens to "wake up and save whatever is left of the city". Recollecting the 1970s and '80s Hegde said the planners did not have any vision for Bengaluru and just allowed it to grow haphazardly. 
 
 "No decision is taken keeping in mind benefits of the people. So citizens must wake up to reclaim the city," he said.
