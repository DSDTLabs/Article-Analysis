Indore: After failing to control power pilferage in the city’s North division, authorities of Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd. (MPPKVVCL) have now decided to replace overhead supply cables with insulated ones to prevent people from tapping into the main lines. Officials said there are around 400 domestic consumers in areas like Pancham Ke Phel and Goma Ki Phel areas under the division. “We found over 40 percent of consumers were drawing power illegally,” said Subroto Roy, superintendent engineer, MPPKVVCL. “Durng inspections, our enforcement teams found power tapping is rampant in these areas. Most of the consumers there had been drawing power illegally from main supply lines,” he said. He added that 40-50 illegal connections were spotted and violators were booked. “The company had been incurring around 40 percent loss, and people are not ready to cooperate with us, so we have decided to replace overhead supply lines with 25 to 35 square mm insulated supply lines,” he added. “Since the locality s known for becoming violent, we decided not to argue with them. Replacing open supply cables with insulated ones is the only option left for us,” an official said. Authorities had been making efforts to set up a 33 KV grid station in Pancham Ki Phel area for a long time. The project is in limbo, due to opposition from locals. They have also approached the district administration and local police authorities seeking protection for company staff to carry out the work.
