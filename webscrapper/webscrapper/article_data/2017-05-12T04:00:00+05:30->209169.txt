AHMEDABAD: After former UP chief minister   that there are martyrs from almost all parts of India but he was yet to see one from  , a driver of AMC’s   (AFES) has filed an application of complaint with   on Thursday.

 Bhavsinh Khadia has requested the city police to book Yadav under IPC sections 124A (sedition), 131 (abetting mutiny), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 500 (defamation).
 
 In his application, Khadia has claimed that he could not sleep on Wednesday after hearing the comment. It was inflammatory and demoralizing for Gujarati soldiers.
 
 “Yadav had earlier made the infamous ‘Gujarat ke Gadhe’ statement. It was clearly an intention to hurt sentiments of Gujaratis. However, this time, it was also a comment against Indian armed forces which don’t differentiate on the basis of a soldier’s domicile. A number of Gujarati youths are serving the motherland and many have laid down their lives. About five months ago, a soldier from Gujarat was beheaded by enemies,” the complaint says.
 
 When asked about the complaint, inspector of Sola police station CL Solanki said he was unaware of any such application. The police station gets numerous applications daily, Solanki said.
