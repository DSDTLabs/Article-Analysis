AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday said that the state government should make the implementation of Right to Education ( ) Act more transparent to benefit poor students in securing free admissions in private schools and asked the government to take proper steps for the same.

 The bench of Justice   and Justice AY Kogje took cognizance of the issue of transparency in 25% free admissions under RTE laws after a   filed by a student Sandip Munjyasara complained that revelation of incomplete details on public domain has led to a situation in which nearly 65,000 poor kids missed admission in class 1 in 2017-18.
 
 Munjyasara has argued that proper declaration of data on government web portal about students who get admission, availability of seats as well as names of schools may enable all poor students to get the benefit of RTE laws.
 
 The judges said that this PIL would only help in bringing in more transparency in the RTE lawâ€™s implementation. The court also took notice of the fact that the law has not been implemented fully resulting in deprivation of free admission to some students.
 
 The petitioner has sought HC directions to the state authorities for display of list of all children admitted in class 1 in each primary school last year along with details on whether children were admitted on free seats or non-RTE seats. 
 
 He has also demanded this information to be placed on notice board at the offices of education officials and schools.
 
 The PIL also demands a complete list of schools giving admissions under RTE provisions and the number of RTE seats made available in those schools. 
 
 This would help the beneficiaries in selection of schools. He has claimed that transparency at this stage would deter schools from providing false data and understating number of RTE seats. This will help poor families in admitting their children in the next academic session.
