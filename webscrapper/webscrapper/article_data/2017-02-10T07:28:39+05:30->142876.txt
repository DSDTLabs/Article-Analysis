MADURAI:   has to produce educational certificates showing that he studied in Chennai before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, to help him disprove the claim of an elderly couple from Madurai that he is their son. Dhanush was asked to produce the certificates on February 14. 

 A petition was filed by Dhanush seeking to quash the case filed by the elderly couple -   and Meenakshi - before the judicial magistrate court in Melur seeking maintenance by claiming paternity. The case came up before   for hearing on Thursday.
 
 The counsel appearing for the couple said the couple has two children - a son and a daughter. They named him   (Dhanush). He studied in schools in Madurai and Sivaganga districts. The counsel also produced documents including ration card, community certificate, family photos and Kalaiselvan's progress report and bus pass. 
 
 However, the counsel appearing for the actor denied all these and said the actor studied in Chennai. After scrutinising the documents submitted by the couple's side, the judge told the actor's counsel that they should produce certificates showing Dhanush's education in Chennai and adjourned the case to February 14. 
 
 Two months ago, R Kathiresan, 65, of Madurai and his wife Meenakshi, 53, filed a case in the judicial magistrate court in Melur. 
 
 They sought maintenance from Dhanush claiming that he was born to them at the Government Rajaji Hospital here on November 7, 1985. The magistrate, who took the case on file on November 25, directed the actor to appear before the court in January. 
 
 Subsequently, the actor filed a petition seeking to quash the proceedings by saying that the case filed by the couple was a clear case of blackmail. The couple had claimed paternity without any proof, he said. Following it, the court had directed the couple to file a counter affidavit. Accordingly, the couple did so.
