 Tentatively titled I am Banjara, the documentary will explore the lives of the Banjara community. “Through the documentary, we have set out to explore the lifestyle of the Banjaras and their take on personal relationships, love and work,” says Deana, adding, “I was born and brought up in the UK, which is a completely different world altogether. So working with this community has been really interesting.” After Jaipur, she plans to shoot in Udaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.
 
  
  
 
 What made Deana choose this unconventional subject? She elaborates, “There isn’t any in-depth documentary that explores the lives of the Banjaras. I feel that this documentary will be an interesting watch for Indians as well as for the people from other parts of the world. They will get to see a very unique style of living.” She adds, “Jaipur is my favourite city in India, but I have always stayed in luxury hotels here. I have often come across people from the Banjara community whilst in Jaipur and wondered about them. The reason I wanted to make a film on them is majorly because I want to know more about this community.”
