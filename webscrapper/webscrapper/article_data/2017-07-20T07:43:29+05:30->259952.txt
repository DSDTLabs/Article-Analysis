 Confirming the development, Vaghela told some reporters on Wednesday, “I am going to Delhi on a personal visit and have no plans to meet Soniaji or Rahulji.”
 
 Coming ahead of his promised show of strength on his birthday celebrations being organized in  , word of Vaghela’s vist to New Delhi has set off a fresh spate of speculations about his political planning.
