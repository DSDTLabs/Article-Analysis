HYDERABAD: Tension ran high at the state-run   on Monday with allegations flying between hospital superintendent Dr P   and junior and PG doctors over the smuggling out of blood samples for lab tests.

 Kumar said a probe was being conducted on the alleged link between doctors and private laboratories over blood sample smuggling. He said two agents, who were ‘illegally’ carrying blood samples out of Gandhi Hospital, were caught red-handed during a surprise visit on Saturday.
 
 “I caught two people on Saturday around 2am near the hospital’s delivery ward. We lodged a police complaint within hours of catching them red-handed. We are trying to find out who the insiders are who called these agents to take the samples. An inquiry has been launched in the matter,”   said. “This is the first time agents have been nabbed redhanded in such a case,” confirmed the official.
 
 The technicians from a private lab, who were caught, have been identified as D   and K Srinivas. They were caught for ‘unauthorized entry’ and ‘trespassing’ into the hospital with the blood samples.
 
 They were sent to judicial remand on Sunday, said the   police.
 
 Under the lens of suspicion, junior and PG doctors protested against superintendent and have demanded an apology from him. They said that the ‘allegations’ against doctors was false and denied the involvement of any doctor in the incident.
 
 “We have falsely been accused of being in nexus with outside labs for sample testing. The superintendent also spoke in a threatening manner with women doctors. He walked out of a meeting abruptly when we went to discuss the matter. We demand an explanation and an apology from him,” said Dr Guguloth Sanjeev, president   unit.
