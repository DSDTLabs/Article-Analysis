LUCKNOW: A class IX student was found hanging at his house in Old  , Mahanagar, on Tuesday morning.   suspect repeated failure in one class forced the boy to take the extreme step. 

 According to police, 19-year-old Vishal Maurya lived in a house allotted to his father Mahesh Maurya. The family was building their own house in Faizullaganj of Madiaon police station area. On Monday night, Vishal left for the Badshahnagar house on some pretext but never returned. On Tuesday morning, the family sent his younger brother Ashu to look for him. 
 
 On reaching the Badshahnagar house, Ashu found it locked from inside. Calls to Vishal went unanswered. A worried Ashu reached the terrace through the neighbour’s terrace for some sign of his brother. That’s when he spotted Vishal’s body hanging from the ceiling with a cloth tied around his neck.
 
 Police inspector, Mahanagar, Sanjay Pandey said Vishal had failed in the exam recently. “He was depressed following his poor result in exams consistently while his friends had moved ahead in life. Hence he ended his life,” he said. He ruled out the possibility of foul play. The body was sent for autopsy and a case was registered.
