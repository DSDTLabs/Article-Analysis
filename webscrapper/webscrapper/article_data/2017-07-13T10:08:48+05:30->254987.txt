SURAT: Body of a 37-year-old woman was found in hanging in her house on   a few kilometres from Navsari town on Wednesday afternoon. Police suspect it to be a murder.

 According to police, deceased   lived with her husband Pratik in Bungalow 71 of Sarvodaya society, at Jamalpore on Italwa Road. Sheetal was alone in the house after her husband Pratik left for work at his fast food outlet at Lunsikui in Navsari and 12-year-old son   for school in the morning.
 
 However, at 2 pm when her son returned, he found front door locked, so he entered the house from the back side to find his mother hanging in her bedroom.
 
 R D Dodhiya, police inspector, Navsari, said, “We have sent the body for postmortem but preliminary inspection suggests that Sheetal was murdered. Blood was found from her mouth.”
 
 Police also found some injury marks on her cheeks and marks of stabbing on her stomach. Forensic postmortem will be conducted on body in Surat on Thursday.
 
 The Desai family has a good reputation in town. Pratik also owns a cake and confectionery shop in Navsari. The couple had been married for 14 years.
