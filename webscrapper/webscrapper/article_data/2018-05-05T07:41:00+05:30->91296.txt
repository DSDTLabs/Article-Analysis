Ludhiana: A Daba resident arrested for alleged possession of 400 grams of heroin, worth Rs 8 lakh, has revealed to his interrogators that he had been declared a proclaimed offender in 20 cases and was facing 36 FIRs, said police here on Friday. 

 The special task force (STF) unit of Ludhiana police arrested Kishan Kumar Ballu (55), after he was found in possession of the contraband in Moti Nagar on Thursday. Ballu, who goes by the alias Vicky Baba, is a resident Issar Nagar, Daba. 
 
 STF in-charge sub-inspector Harbans Singh said the accused had told them that he had been facing 36 serious criminal cases. “He initially took to a life of crime because of unemployment,” he said. “He tried to run away on seeing us at Sector 39 in Moti Nagar, so we chased him down and found the drugs on him.”
 
 The accused told the police that he bought the heroin from New Delhi, and planned to peddle it in Ludhiana. “The cases have been registered against him in Bhatinda and Ludhiana,” said the sub-inspector.
 
 The accused has booked for peddling heroin at Moti Nagar police station.
