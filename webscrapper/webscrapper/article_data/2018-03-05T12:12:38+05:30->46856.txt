HYDERABAD: A day after announcing his intention to play a key role in national politics and lead an alternative front with non-BJP and non-Congress parties,   ( ) president   launched an attackon the NDA government, saying the Centre should focus on foreign policy.

 “We need truthful cooperative federalism in the country, where states should get more powers. Subjects such as health, education, agriculture and urban development shouldbeunder thecontrol of states and not the Centre. The Centre should deal with the issues such as foreign policies, armed forces and national highways,” KCR said at a gathering at his official residence, Pragathi Bhavan, on Sunday.
 
 Pointing tothePradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana for rural roads, KCR said, “What has PM to do with rural roads? States can handle the subject.” Even reservations for SCs, STs and minorities should be given to states as they can decide the quota according to the population in the respective states, hesaid.
 
 He flayed both Congress and BJP, who ruled the country for 64 years, for failing to deliver. “Even after 70 years of independence, why should there be farmers’ suicides in the country?” he asked. Employees’ salaries are increased, commodity rates are hiked from time to time, but minimum support price for farmers’ produce remains unchanged, he added.
 
 The TRS chief also referred to power and water issues. “While states like Chhattisgarh produce surplus power, others do not get power for 14hours. The Centre is a mute spectator to this. The 2004 Brajesh Kumar Tribunal could not resolve water sharing from Krishna and Godavari. We should learn from countries like China, which has emerged economically powerfulwithin 24 years.”
 
 KCR ended his speech saying ‘Jai Telangana, Jai Bharat’. Ministers P Mahender Reddy, T Srinivas Yadav and Nayani Narasimha Reddy, mayor Bonthu Rammohan and other leaders were present.
