MANALI: Though rains have destroyed a large portion of the   in Kullu and Mandi districts of Himachal but the remaining yield is fetching a good price. Soaring tomato prices have toppled domestic budget. The   are fetching a hefty amount in the local vegetable markets.

 The farmers are a happy lot as both ‘A ‘and ‘B’ grade tomatoes are selling at unexpectedly high prices. This has added to the woes of consumers who have urged government to control its price. The wholesale price fetches Rs 50-60 per kg in local markets.
 
 “Even the second quality tomatoes are in huge demand. A lot that is semi-rotten, scarred or diseased is also selling for Rs 30 and above,” a Kullu farmer said. Excessive rain and lack of sunshine results in diseases like blight and fusarium wilt,” he said.
 
 The crop is ready in lower areas while it will take a few more days in the upper reaches. Buyers from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh have already thronged the local markets.
 
 A grower from Mandi, Vipin Sharma said, “Tomato is expensive than seasonal fruit pear. The average price is Rs 60 per kg. Jeeps loaded with tomato are sent to markets every day. Cabbage growers are miffed due to low prices.”
 
 Over 36,000 hectares of land is cultivated in Kullu district alone which is primarily under fruit crops. Tomato and cauliflower are chiefly grown vegetables here.
