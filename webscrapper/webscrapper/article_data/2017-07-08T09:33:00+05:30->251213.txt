SECUNDERBAD: A plan to turn the highly polluted   into a 'clean water' lake is under consideration of the   (SCB). The century-old Ramannakunta is polluted by heavy inflow of sewage.

 Last month, ministry of defence (MoD) gave its nod to SCB to lay a sewer trunk main abutting the lake to prevent drainage water from residential areas in Cantonment from flowing into the water body . Since the lake is categorised as A-1defence land, cantonment board needs permission of MoD for undertaking any development work.
 
 SCB has prepared a Rs 50-lakh proposal to prevent sewage water from residential areas under Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits from entering the lake. SCB may even tie-up with GHMC to lay drainage pipelines in its jurisdiction.
 
 “Our officials also found that sewage from areas falling under GHMC limits was contributing majorly to pollu tion in the lake. To find a permanent solution to the problem, SCB and GHMC have to join hands. SCB is ready to share 50% of the expenditure. If GHMC ex presses helplessness to spend money on the project, then we would pick up the bill for laying sewer network,“ SCB chief executive officer SVR   told TOI.
 
 Soon, SCB will meet GHMC authorities to share its plans with them. A joint inspection of Ramannakunta with GHMC authorities is also being planned. Minister for municipal administration and urban development K   also inspected the lake, added the SCB official.
 
 Meanwhile, officials of Hyderabad   and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), who have taken up laying of sewer trunk mains, on Friday inspected the work.
 
 “Frequent rain is coming in the way of speedy execution of sewer trunk work. We will complete the work within three months,“ said a senior HMWS&SB official.
