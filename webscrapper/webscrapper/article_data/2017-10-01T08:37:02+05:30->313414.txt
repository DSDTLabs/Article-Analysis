MYSURU: Every day, as a bunch of municipal workers sweep the streets of   and go door to door to collect garbage, a 75-year-old man keeps an eagle's eye on them. D   gets up early to monitor the work. "When there is 100% commitment, nothing can prevent you from achieving your goals," he says. 

 The former legislator began his swachh mission around 15 years ago, when he took charge of maintaining one ward of the  . In the corner of a graveyard, he set up a zero solid waste management plant under public-private partnership. It converts waste into manure using cow dung. The plant now serves as a model for municipal corporations across the state.
 
 Today, the lower middle class neighbourhood in north-west   is a shining example of civic awareness. Nearly two tonnes of waste generated by over 5,000 households in Ward 28 – comprising Kumbar Koppal, Kaveri Badavane and Mahadeshwara Layout – is collected from the doorsteps and treated the same day. In less than six hours, the streets are swept, garbage is collected and stormwater drainages are cleaned by a group of 28 workers, using three autorickshaws and a few pushcarts.
 
 Over the years, residents learnt the importance of segregation at source.   attached to self-help groups (SHGs) helped in educating residents by visiting homes. While the manure gets used by farmers from neighbouring areas, the ward generates about Rs 30,000 every month from the sale of used bottles, rubber, etc, which is distributed among SHG members.
 
 Ward 28 is now a model ward. Madegowda attributes it all to people's participation. The septuagenarian is pressing for similar waste plants across Mysuru and is ready to take up the challenge of handling the city's waste.
