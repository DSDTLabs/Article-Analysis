ALLAHABAD: Days after Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) international working president   alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to kill him in a fake encounter,   leaders attending the Sant Sammelan at   on Friday seemed to have distanced themselves from the issue.

 On January 16, Togadia caused ripples across political circles after he went missing for hours, only to be found unconscious in a park in Ahmedabad. He was rushed to a hospital and made the allegation after his discharge. While Togadia’s achievements were highlighted from the stage, top VHP office-bearers as well as activists, who attended the meet, either remained mum or skirted the issue.
 
 VHP international organising secretary Dinesh Tiwari said: “Agar aapko Togadiaji ke baare mein kuch poochhna hai to aap unse hi jaa ke poocch lijiye (If you want to ask anything about Togadiaji, go and ask him yourself).”
 
 VHP’s international general secretary Champat Rai said he will meet Togadia on Saturday. “I can’t comment on media reports. I am going to meet him on Saturday and will inquire about his health. I prefer to get first-hand information,” he told TOI.
 
 “I think Togadia issue should not be raised here. We are with the present leadership and are carrying out the responsibility as per its wishes,” said  , a senior activist of VHP’s Prayag Prant.
 
 “All is going on smoothly in the parishad and this (Togadia) issue is being unnecessary raked up by some people. The event is a big success and credit should be given to present leadership,” said Mukesh Agarwal.
 
 Dr Swami Ashram, who had come to attend the meet from Kanpur, said, “I am neither aware of the Togadia issue nor am interested in it in any way.”
 
 Similarly, senior activist Purushottam too was reluctant to speak. “I do not think this is an appropriate time to talk on Praveen Togadia. Sant Sammelan has been conducted smoothly and this should be highlighted.”
