KANPUR: Morning walkers, on Wednesday, were shocked when they came across posters containing   of a local teenage girl splashed on the walls of a city locality. 

 The matter was immediately brought to the knowledge of the girl’s family members, who in turn informed the local police. The girl’s parents, thereafter, lodged a complaint in this connection accusing a local youth. 
 
 In a complaint to police, girl’s father blamed Rahul for pasting   of his daughter and said that he has been stalking the girl since past one year. The accused is a repeat offender, alleged girl’s family. 
 
 “Rahul has been stalking the girl since past one year. We had earlier apprised the local police outpost about the youth several times but they ignored our pleas asking us not to rake up the issue as it will bring bad name to the family,” said the girl’s father adding that on one occasion, he had even circulated the victim’s morphed obscene pictures on social media.
 
 “An FIR has been registered and raids are underway to arrest youth,” said SHO Naubasta Sanjay Tyagi adding, “We are in the process of collecting vital information related to the youth from the locals of the area to make the case more strong against him.” 
 
 “A case under sections 294 (Obscene Act), 354 (using criminal force to outrage the modesty of woman), 354D (commits the offence of stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides IT Act has been registered at the Naubasta police station and further investigations are underway in this regard,” said SHO further.
