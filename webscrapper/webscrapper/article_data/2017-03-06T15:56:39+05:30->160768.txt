NEW DELHI: After  , now   has also decided to reserve a row of seats for solo   travellers. 

 The low-cost carrier said that from Wednesday – which happens to be International Women’s Day -- it will have the fourth row of its   737s and Q-400s reserved for women flying alone.
 
 “In case of a full flight scenario, males will be assigned window seats; whereas the aisle and middle seats (B, C and D, E) will be assigned to women on a first-come-first-serve basis. The special seating arrangement is being catered to offer more ease to the solo female travellers, as moving out of the middle or the aisle seats is much easier thereby ensuring safety and comfort to them in case of an emergency and even otherwise,” SpiceJet said in a statement.
 
 In a first for airlines globally, Air India had from January 18, this year started reserving one row — six seats — in economy class for single women travellers on domestic flights. 
 
 It reserves the third row in economy section of its single aisle planes used for flying within the country. It may replicate the move for international fligts also, depending on how successful this move turns out to be.
 
 The first two rows in economy class are sold at a premium because of extra leg room. Due to this, Air India has reserved the row immediately behind them for women.
 
 Air India’s move had come after a woman passenger on a Mumbai-Newark flight last December was reportedly molested by a person who left his business class seat to sit next to her in the economy section. After this case, AI decided to keep plastic restrainers for unruly passengers on all its flights.
