VIJAYAWADA: In a sensation move, YSR Congress MP   announced that he would serve a privilege notice on   chief minister N   for ‘denigrating the Prime Minister’s Office’ and attributing ill-motives. Naidu had questioned more than once in the Assembly and Council the intentions of PM Modi and his office in entertaining those accused of financial fraud.

 “Naidu has clearly violated the Constitution and Parliamentary rules by casting aspersions on the PMO. At the same time, he also resorted to breach of privilege by questioning my right as an MP to meet the PM,” Reddy said.
 
 Vijayasai Reddy also fired a salvo at Naidu, accusing him of having met Vijay Mallya in London and taking ?150 crore. “CM met Mallya on March 12, 13 & 14 in 2016. Didn’t he meet Mallya after 10 days of him leaving the country?” he wondered.
 
 Reddy has also questioned Naidu’s visit to Delhi despite huge political happenings in the state. Naidu is on a two-day visit to the capital to gather support for the Special Category Status (SCS) for AP and other demands according to the Andhra Pradesh
