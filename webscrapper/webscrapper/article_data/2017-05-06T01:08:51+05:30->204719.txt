NEW DELHI: The crime branch has   an   and arrested three men, including two commerce graduates. According to police, the accused lured unsuspecting youths by promising them jobs in multinational companies. They had rented a place in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, which was used as a call centre. 

 The accused—Abhimanyu Singh, Om Vasudev Sharma and Rohit Kashyap—ran a website www.zeeobs.com. Singh is the mastermind of this racket, who has been involved in such activities since 2014.
 
 Initially, police received a complaint from a final-year MCom student, saying that she had submitted her resume at a popular job portal, after which she received a call from Zeebos. The call centre employee asked her to register herself on their site and demanded a registration fee of Rs 2,300. 
 
 Once she deposited the money, they demanded Rs 6,500 for the interview after a few days. This time, however, she refused to pay more and asked them to cancel her registration. She also demanded a refund of her fees but the accused said that they would not be able to do so for two months. 
 
 Sensing foul play, the complainant informed the cops on March 6. “Call details provided by the complainant were scanned. The statements of the account numbers in which the complainant had deposited the money were analysed as well. The addresses to which the mobile numbers were issued were found to be fake,” said Ram Gopal Naik, DCP (crime). 
 
 The cops got in touch with some other people, who too lodged similar complaints. A total of Rs 30 lakh had been deposited in the account in the past four months from different parts of India.
