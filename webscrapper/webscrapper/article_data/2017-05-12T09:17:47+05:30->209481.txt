CUTTACK: To provide relief to the   suffering from   in  , the   in 2013 had announced to set up a   in the region. But even after four years, the project is yet to see the light of the day. 

 At least 21 villages in Narsinghapur block and 17 villages in Badamba have been worst affected by kidney diseases. In last four years, over 900 kidney patients have been identified in Narsinghpur alone. 
 
 Locals have alleged that despite the situation being alarming, the state government is yet to take any measures to contain the problem. 
 
 The government has completed its duty by constructing a building for the dialysis unit and putting up the nameplate, said a local social worker Bijay Panda. It seems government has forgotten to procure a dialysis unit and appoint a nephrologist to make the unit functional. The poor patients have to travel to Cuttack and Bhubaneswar to undergo dialysis, bearing the travel cost, said Panda.
 
 Chief district medical officer (CDMO)G D Paramguru said that an auto-analyser machine has been installed at Narsinghpur for prompt diagnosis of kidney diseases. Besides, a proposal has been sent to the state government for installation of a dialysis unit at Narsinghpur. "We are yet to receive any response from the government in this regard," said Paramguru.
 
 The CDMO claimed that an inter-disciplinary committee, consisting of nephrologists, experts from SCB Medical College and Hospital, officials of Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, and rural water supply and sanitation had conducted a detailed survey in the region but they found no exact reason behind outbreak of kidney diseases in Narsinghpur. He claimed that the administration organizes special camps for identification of kidney patients in the area and brings them to SCB for necessary treatment.
