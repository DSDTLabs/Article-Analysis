GHAZIABAD: An electrical   was allegedly duped of his mobile phone and Rs 1.05 lakh on Saturday while he was returning to his home in   of Meerut from Noida. 

 The victim, Sushil Chauhan, told the police that three men came in a car while he was waiting for a bus on Meerut Road in Ghaziabad. They offered Kumar to drop him at his destination, to which he agreed.
 
 “Chauhan said there were two men inside the car, besides the driver. They identified themselves as crime branch officials who were on their way to Faizabad, to crack a case in which a woman was murdered and Rs 22 lakh were robbed. Chauhan believed their story. They also picked up another man from Meerut Road to drop him at his destination. On their way, the two men put their valuables inside a white envelope, saying the road ahead was not safe. They asked Chauhan and the other passenger to put all their belongings into the envelope. They also tricked Chauhan to divulge his debit card pin codes. Near Duhai, the men handed over the envelope to him and the other passenger and dropped them saying they had some other work. After being dropped, the other passenger told Chauhan that he will return in a couple of minutes after meeting an official, but when the man did not return, the man opened the envelope and found a piece of newspaper inside,” Muradnagar police station in-charge, Balram Yadav told TOI.
 
 The men withdrew Rs 5,000 from Chauhan’s one debit card and Rs 1 lakh from the other debit card. No FIR has been registered in the matter so far.
