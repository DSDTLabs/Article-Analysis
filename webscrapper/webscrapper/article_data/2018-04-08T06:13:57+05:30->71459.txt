 has been secretly deleting some of the messages the company’s chief executive officer   sent through its Messenger application, an option that hasn’t been available to most of the social network’s 2.2 billion users. Facebook is now planning to make its ‘Unsend’ feature available to all users in coming months. 

 According to a report in technology website Tech Crunch on Saturday, unless the feature is released for everyone, Facebook will not unsend or retract any more of Zuckerberg’s messages. The company says it has been removing Zuckerberg’s messages from the inboxes of various people for several years. The recipients of Zuckerberg’s messages weren’t informed before that happened. 
 
 Facebook is making the acknowledgement Friday after   first reported the tactic. The social media giant says it began erasing the messages of Zuckerberg and a few other top executives in 2014 after computer hackers obtained and released emails from   executives. The Sony messages included disparaging remarks about movie stars and other people in the entertainment industry. The company apologised for not making the feature available to all sooner.
