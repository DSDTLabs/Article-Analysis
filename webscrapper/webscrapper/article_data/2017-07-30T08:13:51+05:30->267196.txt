VIJAYAWADA: National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA)   candidate   has heaped praise on Prime Minister   and explained why he had turned emotional when his candidature was announced by the BJP parliamentary party.

 Speaking at a programme organised to felicitate him in Vijayawada on Saturday, Venkaiah Naidu said a misinformation campaign is being conducted by some that he was sidelined from active politics by the party’s central leadership by nominating him for a constitutional post. 
 
 He said the party had selected him to contest the election as it wanted a person from   to be the vice-president.
 
 “I was in tears as I was overcome by emotion as I will be disassociated with the party with which I had a very long association. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also present on the occasion, was shocked to witness that. 
 
 There was a misinformation campaign that I was sidelined from active politics as I will claim the prime minister seat in 2019. I wanted to retire from active politics after seeing Modi as prime minister for a second term. He is the god’s boon to India. He has the capacity to develop India,” he said.
 
 “Above all, the party wants someone who can run   smoothly. I was never after power and ministerial posts. I always opted for party posts even during the Vajpayee’s tenure,” he added.
