Hyderabad: An Indian charged with   in   was sentenced to four months imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of 5,000   riyals on Wednesday.

 Shankar Ponnam of Jagtial had been arrested by the Riyadh police on November 22 last year as he had shared a blasphemous post on Facebook.
 
 After he was convicted for the crime, Shankar Ponnam, an agriculture labour, called up his family in Jagtial and informed them about his fate. 
 
 “Shankar does not have the money to pay the fine imposed on him and neither do we have such a huge amount. We urged the state government and the central government to come to his rescue,” Ponnam Rajendar, elder brother of Shankar said. The fine amount works out to Rs 90,810.
 
 Rajendar told TOI that his brother had gone to work as an agriculture labour and had no intention of hurting anybody’s religious sentiments in Saudi Arabia. Ponnam was working in Tameer district of Al-Majmaah when he shared the offensive FB post on November 12, 2016.
 
 It may be mentioned here that external affairs minister   had directed the   in Riyadh to take up Shankar’s case with the Saudi government when the issue was brought to light by TOI. Shankar’s family is a worried lot as they are unsure about when he will be freed as they cannot pay the fine amount imposed by a local court in Saudi Arabia.
