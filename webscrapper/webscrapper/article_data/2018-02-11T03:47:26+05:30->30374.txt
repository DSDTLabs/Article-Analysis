NEW DELHI: A headless bare body of a woman was found in a park near   in   on Saturday morning. Police said the victim, in her 20s, could have been killed elsewhere and the body dumped in the park later. 

 The body was gnawed by street dogs when locals spotted it and told police. The possibility of sexual assault has not been ruled out and police are trying to recover the head to identify her.
 
 Police received a call around 10am when a group of morning walkers saw the body in a bush and reported the matter. When a team reached the spot, they found the upper portion of the body eaten by animals. Police suspect the accused might have brought the body in a bag and dumped it there. The body was partially decomposed and had injury marks on the legs and arms. Her clothes were also missing from the spot. 
 
 A preliminary probe revealed that the woman was five-feet tall with a wheatish complexion and might have had a scuffle before being murdered. Police said they were going through missing reports registered in the past five days to get some lead.
 
 The crime and forensic teams were sent to the spot and fingerprints and footprints were lifted. 
 
 Police said they are waiting for the autopsy report to get a clearer picture. They have preserved the body at a morgue for identification and an FIR against unknown person has been registered at the Mehrauli police station.
