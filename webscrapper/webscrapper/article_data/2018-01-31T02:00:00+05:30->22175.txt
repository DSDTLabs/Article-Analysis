PATNA:   (BSEB) on Tuesday sought public opinion on the proposed regulation of the special scholarship -- ‘Desh Ratan Dr Rajendra Prasad Medha Chatravriti’. 

 The special scholarship will be given to the top 10 rank holders in matriculation (Class X) examination and 5 rank holders of Intermediate (Class XII) of all streams (science, commerce and arts). BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said the draft regulation has been uploaded to the board’s website www.biharboard.ac.in to seek the public opinion. The portal will be open for the next 10 days.
 
 “Based on public opinion, the board will make necessary changes in the parameters for scholarship,” Kishor said. In the draft regulation, the board has put certain terms and conditions for the toppers to avail the scholarship.
 
 “It is compulsory for the toppers to take admission in schools and colleges approved by the central or state governments and there should be no gap in studies and must maintain good conduct in the school/college. The awardees should not be in job with salary while studying. The scholarship is not applicable to the students who pursue their studies in any foreign university, college or school. Awardees will have to secure aggregate of 60% during their study period in order to continue their scholarship,” Kishor said and added: “Once the scholarship discontinued for not following the terms and conditions, it cannot be revived under any circumstances.”
 
 Ten toppers of Class X will get Rs1,200 per month for two years to pursue higher secondary education. Five toppers of Class XII will get Rs1,500 per month with its term depending on the duration of the course they are pursuing.
