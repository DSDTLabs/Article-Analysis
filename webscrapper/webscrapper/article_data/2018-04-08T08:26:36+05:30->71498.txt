BARNALA: To explore the possibility of setting up a   in   district village a joint team, including representatives of Barnala DC and principal of Government Medical College, Patiala, on Saturday visited the site. The   Waqf Board has already offered 36 acres at   village in the district for the purpose. 

 The team would hand over its report to Barnala DC Dharampal Gupta and the medical college principal in five days and thereafter the officials would take up the matter with the government. 
 
 Punjab’s principal secretary, medical education and research, Sanjay Kumar on Friday had sent a letter to Barnala DC and the Patiala GMC principal and directed them to set up a joint team to study feasibility of the site for setting up a medical college. Barnala DC while confirming the development said that, “A team visited the site on Saturday to check feasibility. In a few days, the report will be sent to the state government.”
 
 Sources said former Barnala   Kewal Singh Dhillon had urged chief minister Amarinder Singh to set up a medical college in Barnala, which lacked educational and healthcare facilities. Former MLA and   leader Dhillon said that, “I have raised the matter with the CM to allot medical college to Barnala district, to which he readily agreed. The Waqf Board has offered the land and the government is conducting a feasibility study. We are hopeful of getting the nod soon to set up a medical college.”
 
 He said during the previous term of the Congress government in Punjab, Barnala was made a district and now a medical college would be set up there.
