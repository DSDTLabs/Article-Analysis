After the National Award-winning film Joker, director   has finalised his next, titled  . Unlike his earlier films — Cuckoo and Joker — both of which were offbeat in nature, this one, we hear, will be a commercial outing. The director has roped in   to play the lead role. 

 Murugan confirms, “All my films have a social thought. Though this one will be made on a bigger scale, the film touches upon a social issue. I wanted someone who could perform very well and who is commercially big. I felt Jiiva would be apt for this role. He has a knack for choosing different scripts and has a repertoire of interesting films. When I met him for narration, he, too, liked the subject a lot. We have a mutual understanding and I look forward to shooting with him.” 
 
 The pre-production work has begun now. Ask him about the title and he says, “Gypsy literally means naadodigal... I can’t reveal any more details about it right now.”
