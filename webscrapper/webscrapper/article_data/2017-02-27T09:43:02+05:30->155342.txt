NAGPUR: A vehicle reached near the   (ARO), opposite the railway station at Sunday midnight. Candidates camping at the place a night before the written test were asked to come along if they wanted the question paper in advance. 

 Even as many of the students refused, they could convince some of them who went along to the Maurya marriage hall at  , though reluctantly, alleged candidates coming out of the ARO after the exam, which was soon cancelled.
 
 The candidates alleged the involvement of the army insiders in the racket. Candidates also that said they got calls from the agents who ran coaching classes asking if they wanted the question paper in advance. 
 
 “I did not fall in the trap but am still at a loss. The exam has been cancelled and many who did not cheat will have to appear again,” said one of students who had appeared for the examination. 
 
 The candidates said they had not given their   numbers to any one but could still be contacted by the agents. They alleged that information about them was leaked from ARO. Police say since all the accused are running coaching classes they are expected to have the candidates’ numbers. 
 
 The 210 candidates at Nagpur who were detained after the raid were also allowed to take the test as the leak was not confirmed till ARO opened the papers. 
 
 “Everyone had a doubt that the papers will be cancelled as those detained were talking about the police action before the exams. But nobody was sure that the paper has been actually leaked,” said a candidate.
 
 However, as the paper was handed over around 28 of the 50 questions were same in one of the papers. There were similarities in others papers too.
 
 “As soon as they saw the question ‘who is prime minister of Pakistan’ those having got the leaked paper were assured that they had got right questions from the agents” said a candidate.
