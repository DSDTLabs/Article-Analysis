NEW DELHI: A   who used   to go past tolls and   without being caught was arrested on Wednesday. 

 Salim (28), who was driving a white Maruti SX4, was stopped near northeast Delhi’s Keshav Chowk flyover at 3.30am. While checking, the police found that the rear seat of the car had been removed and the space was full of cartons containing liquor bottles. DCP (northeast) Atul Kumar Thakur said Salim was arrested under sections of the Excise Act and IPC.
 
 Investigating officers in the case said that checking at pickets was intensified after they received information about smuggling of illicit liquor from the Welcome area. On Wednesday, police noticed Salim’s car with two ‘Bharat Sarkar’ stickers on it.
 
 Salim told the police that he was employed by a supplier, Hassan, as a driver. He was handed over the car, along with the liquor, at GT Karnal Road. 
 
 The alcohol that he was carrying was to be supplied to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh and to parts of northeast Delhi. 
 
 Police said Salim ran a juice shop but was not earning enough money, so he later got in touch with Hassan, who promised him a handsome pay for each consignment that he delivered. He was asked to say he was the driver of a cabinet minister or secretary if anyone stopped him.
