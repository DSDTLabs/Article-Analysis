Vadodara: As the International Mother’s Day dawned in the city on Sunday, dozens of Barodians gathered on the banks of Vishwamitri River that flows through the heart of the city.  They first folded their hands and prayed in front of the river that has been giving life to not just humans but a variety of species over thousands of years. If kids recited poetry, adults explained the importance of the river and sang songs on the ghaats near Kala Ghoda Circle.  “As we are leading urban lives, both kids and grownups have got distanced from the natural environs, especially rivers, that are such an important part of our ecosystem. In our culture, rivers are reverred as mothers, so we decided to bring citizens closer to this river,” said Milind Gadre, member of the Nature Walk group that had organized the programme. “The kids, who turned up for this event, got to learn about the river and its biodiversity. They were very excited as they stood on the historic ghaats near Kala Ghoda. This was the best Mother’s Day that I have ever celebrated,” said Shubhangi Manohar, another group member. All the participants offered flowers to the river and took pledge to protect it for the sake of the city’s future.
