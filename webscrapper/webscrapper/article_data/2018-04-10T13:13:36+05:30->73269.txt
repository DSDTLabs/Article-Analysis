'The  ' has addressed the criticism that the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon perpetuates negative South Asian stereotypes.

 
 In the episode "No Good Read Goes Unpunished", Marge and Lisa indirectly discuss the portrayal of Apu.
 
 Marge has edited a new version of ' The Princess in the Garden' to make it more acceptable in 2018. Marge reads the story of a South American girl fighting for wild horse rescue but Lisa says the character lacks emotional journey.
 
 Marge, who has made the book as inoffensive as possible, says, 'What am I supposed to do?"
 
 Lisa replies, "It is hard to say, something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?"
 
 The response did not go down well comedian Hari Kondabolu, who has written and stars in the documentary "The Problem with Apu".
 
 "Wow. 'Politically Incorrect?' That's the takeaway from my movie & the discussion it sparked? Man, I really loved this show. This is sad," Kondabolu wrote on Twitter.
 
 "In 'The Problem with Apu,' I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalised groups & why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress," he added.
