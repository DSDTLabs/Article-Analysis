Nagpur: Noted writer Neelima Kulkarni unfolded various aspects of short stories based on her experiences not only in India but also in the world at ‘Katha Collage’, a programme organized by Abhivyakti Vaidarbhiya Lekhika Sanstha at Baburao Dhanwate Hall, Shankar Nagar, on Tuesday.

 An engineer by profession who retired from Indian Bureau of Mines as an officer, Kulkarni also holds a postgraduate degree in Marathi. Kulkarni presented many short stories from her books ‘Deshantarichya Katha’, ‘Amerikechya Angani ’, ‘Soon Majhi Laadki’ and ‘Aise Haluvaar Paan’, taking the listeners to a level in which they related themselves and went down memory lane.
 
 Kulkarni, who is based in America for the last 25 years and travelled to over 35 countries till now, shared the experience while narrating some part of her book ‘Amerikechya Angani’. 
 
 Living far from your country is not easy and that too when you are from India. I have a special love for Marathi and that is the reason why I pursued MA in the language. Living abroad made me write the book,” she said. 
 
 Kulkarni said that the culture of India is the missing part when someone moves out of the country.
 
 Moving further, she narrated short stories from ‘Soon Majhi Laadki’ which has beautifully depicted the relationship of a mother with her daughter-in-law. She said that the circumstances have changed over a period of time as girls first step out of the house to live in a hostel for college education. 
 
 Then follows higher education and a job. By the time the urbanized girl is ready for marriage, she is well into her mid-twenties, having established in career, gained knowledge about the world outside and is financially independent. As time has changed, the people also need to change their mindset towards women.
 
 President of the organization Supriya Iyer and Swati Surangalikar conducted the programme.
