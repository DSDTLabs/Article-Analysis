HYDERABAD: In gross violation of a   order that laid down norms for installation of statues, several of them have sprung up across the city over the last few years. A quick scan reveals that a majority of them, dotting the peripheral areas of the   (GHMC) limits, are that of political leaders erected by party members.

 
 Some of the areas in the city that sport these statues are Kukatpally,   and Qutbullapur.
 
 
  
 In 2013, the SC took serious objection to erecting of statues and ordered all state governments and Union Territories to deny permission for the same. It categorically stated that statues can be installed only with permission of the collector or the council (for urban areas). Yet, some politicians continue to flout the norms.
 
 In Balanagar, for instance, the statue of a Congressman stands right on a busy by-lane, thus creating hindrance for the smooth flow of traffic. And this is only one of the six dotting this area. Similarly, Quthbullapur has five statues while there’s one in Kukatpally.
 
 “These statues create severe inconvenience to commuters as they occupy a major part of the roads. They should be removed immediately,” said Shashant B, a marketing executive who uses the Balanagar road frequently.
 
 His concerns are seconded by P M  , a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader and RTI activist. “As they are against SC order, they should be done away with to make way for other developmental works,” he added.
 
 Recently, G  , a co-option member of GHMC, even wrote to GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy, complaining about the menace and urging him to take action immediately.
 
 When contacted, a senior GHMC official said,“We are not allowing new statues in any of the zones, but fearing a law and order crisis we are being able to raze the old ones. Political parties might use this as an issue while campaigning for the upcoming elections. We hope to find a solution to this issue soon.”
