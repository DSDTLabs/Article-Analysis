Ludhiana: A part of Malhar Road, near Shastri Nagar railway crossing, caved in on Monday night.

 The municipal corporation (MC) officials said leakage in a sewerage line under the road caused the cave-in. 
 
 The civic body has served notices on two eateries located nearby for connecting their sewerage line with road gulleys, which are meant for rainwater disposal, instead of the main sewerage line of the MC. 
 
 The road gave way on Monday night, but the civic body officials learned about it on Tuesday when the area shopkeepers called them up. 
 
 The teams of MC operation and maintenance cell and building and road branch rushed to the spot. 
 
 Executive engineer of operation and maintenance cell Nacchtar Singh said, “At least 3.5 feet under the road, a sewerage line has got damaged. Its leak caused the cave-in. About a month ago, a part of the same road had collapsed due to the leakage. Then, the area residents had not informed the MC and instead filled the crater on their own.” 
 
 Superintending engineer of building and road department Dharam Singh said, “There is nothing wrong with the road construction. A damaged sewerage line caused it.” 
 
 “The road had collapsed a month ago, too. A mini truck had got stuck in the cavity then. Fortunately, there was no accident this time,” said a shopkeeper. 
 
 The stretch is frequented by those coming from Model Town, Shastri Nagar and other adjoining localities to reach Ferozepur Road.
