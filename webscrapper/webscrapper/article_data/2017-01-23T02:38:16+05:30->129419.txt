MUMBAI: The All India   (AIMIM) fighting   for the first time threatens to eat into the vote bank of the Congress and the   (SP), political analysts say. Although the Congress and the SP have an alliance for Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, they do not have a tie-up in Mumbai. This may prove to beneficial for  , an analyst said.

 Of the 227 corporators in the outgoing corporation, around 23 of them are Muslims. The MIM has decided to focus on areas that have a significant minority population. MIM sources said the party plans to contest 45-50 carefully selected seats, such as Byculla, Mohammad Ali Road, JJ Hospital area, Mumbadevi, Nagpada, Dongri, Wadala and Dharavi in the island city. 
 
 It is also eyeing Bandra (E), Jogeshwari, Malad, Dindoshi, Andheri in Western suburbs and Govandi- Shivaji Nagar-Baiganwadi in eastern suburbs. The MIM feels these wards may provide the party easy entry to the BMC house.
 
 Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the MIM will benefit if the Congress and NCP do not have an alliance. “As the Congress and NCP have not formed an alliance, their votes might be split and the MIM would emerge as alternative,” said Jondhale. 
 
 MIM legislator Waris Pathan, however, said. “People look at MIM as an alternative to other parties to address their civic issues. Our fight is not only with the Congress, the NCP and the SP but also Sena and BJP, which are in power.”
