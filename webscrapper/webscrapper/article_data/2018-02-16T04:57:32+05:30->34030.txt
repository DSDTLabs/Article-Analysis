NEW DELHI: It was business as usual at South Delhi’s tony shopping mall, The Chanakya. Swanky cars trailed each other in the driveway while shoppers in their chic designer wear fiddled with their   Xs. The only oddity was a bunch of reporters with cameras trained on a large hoarding of   . 

 On the ground floor inside, security guards with radios kept close watch on the jewellery mogul’s boutique. The glass façade was covered with blinds and anybody who managed to get close to the store was quietly ushered away. A nonchalant enquiry revealed that the boutique was closed for the day. But something didn’t seem right. The lights were on inside. 
 
 “The cops are perhaps here,” said a senior executive at the mall. “Maybe an audit is in progress.” And soon enough, a man, who appeared to be part of the staff at the store, peered out from behind the blinds. He unlocked the glass doors and let another man in but not before patting him down. 
 
 The procedure was repeated a few times in the next one hour, as people who seemed connected with the store were let in, cautiously. It finally ended with a man knocking on the doors with packets of milk. Maybe, the coffee machine had run out. A few kilometres and many traffic signals away, at Modi’s second store in the Capital at Defence Colony, the lights were out. 
 
 At this once-hallowed address, there were no chauffeurs in fancy automobiles waiting for their ‘madams’ to come back with large colourful rocks. A lone security guard stared back helplessly at cameramen shooting away from the darkness of the shadows. Around the corner, a svelte   draped in Modi’s resplendent jewels gazed into the horizon from a giant hoarding, as headlights of a thousand cars drew red lines in the dusk. It seemed, diamonds could still turn out to be a woman’s best friend, but maybe not a man’s anymore.
