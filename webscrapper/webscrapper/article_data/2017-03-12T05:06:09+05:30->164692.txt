AHMEDABAD: A team of state police’s CID (crime) is camping in Mount Abu to question  , the prime accused in a multi-crore scam, who has surrendered to  . 

 Officials said the process is on to get Agarwal to Gujarat so that he can be questioned in a total of 12 cases registered against Arbuda Credit Cooperative Society Ltd.
 
 Anil Pratham, ADGP, CID (crime), said that a team has been sent to Mount Abu for this. “Six of the cases are being investigated by CID teams,” Pratham said.
 
 Mount Abu-based micro credit firm had started operating in Gujarat two years ago and lured investors with lucrative interest rates on recurring deposits and long-term and short-term fixed deposits. So far, FIRs have been filed for cheating of Rs 4.75 crore, primarily in districts of North Gujarat. Apart from Agarwal, other persons named in the complaints include Asha Agarwal, Nisha Agarwal and Meharsingh Thakur. 
 
 The promoters had stopped making payments since February. This had caused widespread panic among investors. 
 
 Though officials of the cooperative society assured investors that they would get back their investment, there was a rush to withdraw money. When the society claimed to have no money, the investors had approached the police with a complaint for cheating.
 
 CID officials said that they are yet to ascertain the scope of the scam but steps have been taken to acquire documents pertaining to the case from various spots.
