VARANASI: Though the district administration ensured   in the   where   will queue up to enter   for   on first Monday of Shrawan, failure of officials in improving condition of roads kept the march challenging. 

 The work of laying carpets in red and green started in the barricaded areas on Godowlia-Maidagin road on Sunday. The temporarily repaired roads hinted that moving on it after coming out of KVT will not be an easy task for the Kanwariyas. Kanwariyas thronging the city from Allahabad and Bhadohi highways pass through Manduadih and Rathyatra roads to reach Dashaswamedh Ghat for taking dip in Ganga and filling their urns to offer Jalabhishek at KVT. Roads, especially along Manduadih railway over bridge, were in a pathetic condition. Taking note, the DM asked PWD officials to ensure complete repair of this road.
 
 Repair works were also in progress on the routes connecting KVT with Lucknow, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Chandauli highways. But, the use of debris and other materials, which could not be levelled properly, were hinting clearly that moving bare foot on these roads will be a risky affair for the Kanwariyas.
 
 While repair works continued on the Kanwariya routes, the officials including DM and SSP RK Bhardwaj a briefing sessions for the police and paramilitary forces arrived here for Shrawan month security duty from other districts.
