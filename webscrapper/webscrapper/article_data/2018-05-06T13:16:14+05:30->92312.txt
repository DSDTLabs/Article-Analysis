THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Downplaying the row over a photograph of Mohammed Ali   hanging on the   students' hall,   national ameer (president) Jalaluddin Umari said on Saturday here that it had been on display for the past 80 years. 

 
 "Even several   leaders have admitted it. Now, if somebody still felt discomfort over the picture, I would suggest them to approach the court or hold a talk with the students' union," he said.
 
 "There is no merit in the controversy. The university students' union used to give life membership to scholars and other luminaries and Jinnah too was honoured in the same way back in 1938. Jinnah's contribution to the Independence struggle could not be ignored. After all, why are people raking up a controversy now? Such trifling controversies would only show the country in a bad light," the Muslim scholar said.
 
 The secular and democratic values of the Constitution were facing tough challenges, he said, adding: "Our support is with all those who voice their protest against the assault over the fundamental tenets of democracy. I appeal all of them to come together for the common cause. India, being a secular country, is not supposed to have any one national religion. Now, there are attempts to cast into one mould the culture and characteristics of the diverse country," he said.
 
 "Not even a single worker of our organization has ever been arrested or proved guilty of any extremist activities. Some people work overnight to shower baseless allegations against us. We are confident to prove the allegations against us wrong in the court," said Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (Kerala) secretary P P  .
 
 The state government had earlier submitted in the high court that several books published by the organization carried objectionable content and had set up an expert committee for examining them. However, the findings of the committee have not yet been made public.
