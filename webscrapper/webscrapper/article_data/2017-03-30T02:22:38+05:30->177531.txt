NEW DELHI: The government informed Parliament on Wednesday that the number of personnel opting for voluntary retirement service ( ) in central paramilitary forces rose to around 450% in 2016-17 as compared to the previous year.

 In a written reply in the  , minister of state for home Kiren   cited personal and domestic reasons, among others, for personnel going on VRS. He, however, said these resignations are “essentially a personal choice”.
 
 An up-to-date data provided by the minister stated that 2016-17 saw the maximum number of personnel (9,065) going for VRS in the last three years from forces like CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF, SSB and Assam Rifles. While in 2014-15, a total of 5,289 personnel of these forces had taken VRS, the figure had come down to 2,105 in 2015-16.
 
 The attrition has been plaguing the almost 10-lakh-strong central paramilitary forces for a long time now. Sources in these forces said while domestic reasons force most of the men to leave, career stagnation, lack of pay parity and tough working conditions also play an important part in such retirements.
 
 Officials say these retirements leave a huge gap in the vacancies in the forces, which are being used for major law and order duties on the border, J&K, Maoist-affected states, elections, VIP security and other purposes.
 
 The maximum cases of VRS in 2016-17 were reported from the   (4,274), followed by the Central Reserve Police Force (3,280) and the Central Industrial Security Force (765).
 
 Providing a separate data on the personnel who left these forces by way of resignation, Rijiju stated that a total of 1,187 officials left in 2016-17, 1,840 in 2015-16 and 1,989 in 2014-15. “The Central Armed Police Force personnel proceed on voluntary retirement and resignation mainly due to personal and domestic reasons, including children and family issues, health or illness of self or family members, social or family obligations and commitments, among others.
 
 Some personnel sought voluntary retirement to enjoy a static life as well as pensionary benefits after completing 20 years of service,” he said.
