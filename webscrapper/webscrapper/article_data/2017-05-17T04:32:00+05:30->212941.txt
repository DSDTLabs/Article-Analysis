NAGPUR: In a bizarre incident, a young forest guide with Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR), committed suicide by consuming pesticide on Tuesday after his parents refused to get him a motorcycle.

 The victim,   (22), belonging to a farmer’s family worked as a guide at   gate of the tiger reserve. On Tuesday, as a routine, his colleague Sheshrao Waghdhare called Kailash to come along at the gate but as Kailash did not respond, Shehrao went ahead. 
 
 However, around 8am when Kailash, who was sleeping on the terrace, did not woke up, his family members went upstairs and found white substance frothing from his mouth. He was shifted to Government Medical College & Hospital (GMCH) where he was declared dead.
 
 According to forest department sources, Kailash had attempted suicide eight days ago by severing his veins. He had a tiff with his stepmother and father for not buying a bike for him. He also had a love affair with a girl close to his family. Last year, Kailash was sent to   for guides’ training.
 
 Initially, news spread that the suicide had something to do with the two-day guides’ strike on Saturday and Sunday. However, Maharashtra State Guides Union president Arun Latkar said, “It has nothing to do with the strike. Kailash committed suicide owing to family problems.”
