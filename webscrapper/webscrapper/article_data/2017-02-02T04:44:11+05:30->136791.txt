The government has put big money on the table for infrastructure, a move that will improve connectivity, push growth by creating demand for core sector output, and create jobs in the hinterland. 

 Infr astructure projects have been allotted Rs 3.96 lakh crore for 2017-18, up from the revised estimate of Rs 3.58 lakh crore for 2016-17. The   estimate for FY17 was Rs 3.48 lakh crore. NHAI, which builds highways, has got Rs 64,900 crore, an increase of 24% over the Budget for FY17. Rs 27,000 crore has been allotted to build rural roads, the same level as the previous Budget. 
 
  Indeed, the government's rural thrust is very clear from an increase in allocation for village electrification from Rs 8,500 crore last fiscal to Rs 10,635 crore. "There is undiluted focus on rural electrification, with a clear time-bound plan to electrify the last village of India. The increased allocation to Deen Dayal Gram Jyoti Yojana will help achieve complete electrification of India," said CLP India executive director Amarthaluru Subba Rao.
