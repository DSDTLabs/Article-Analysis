GAYA: The Bihar government on Tuesday challenged the Gaya additional chief judicial magistrate ( )’s order that discharged Punjab Police’s AIG   in a case registered against him for allegedly obtaining his job on the basis of a fake degree of   (MU). The university is headquartered in   in Bihar.

 The revision petition challenging the ACJM’s February 20 order has been filed by public prosecutor Sartaj Ali Khan in the court of district and sessions judge Sajal Mandalwar.
 
 Earlier, ACJM S K Rai reversed his own order to frame charges against the police officer. This followed a directive of the then Chief Justice Iqbal Ahmad Ansari of the Patna high court for a fresh appraisal of the available evidence. 
 
 The Bihar government’s revision petition maintains that the case against Parampal was “prima facie” true and there was enough evidence for his prosecution. It extensively refers to the documentary evidence against the police officer’s claim to have duly obtained the MU degree. 
 
 The admission records and other official documents show that Parampal was never admitted to   College-Sohsarai, a constituent unit of MU, the petition says and adds Sociology, the subject that Parampal claims to have studied, was not taught in the college at that point of time.
 
 According to sources, the petition also refers to a report of Punjab-cadre IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh who, after scanning the relevant records available with the Punjab government and MU, indicted Parampal and recommended registration of a criminal case against him.
