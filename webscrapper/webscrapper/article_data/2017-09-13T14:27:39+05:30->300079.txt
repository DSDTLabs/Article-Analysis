ERODE: The sale of banned tobacco products such as gutka and pan masala is rampant in shops across the   district. Despite the ban, all forms of chewing tobacco products are available in the shops in the district, say activists.

 “Though officials conduct surprise raids, all the banned tobacco products are available easily in the market,” said K Chandrasekaran, an activist. He said the officials did not take any stern action against the shop owners.
 
 “The food safety officials did not take any stern action against the shop owners for selling banned tobacco products,” he added.
 
 When contacted by TOI, district designated officer of the   Food Safety and Drug Administrative Department (TNFSDAD) T   said all the FSOs (food safety officers) are continuously conducting raids across the district.
 
 “Recently, I had raided two go-downs and few shops in the city and seized banned tobacco products worth Rs 7.5 lakh,” she said.
 
 She added that she had sent sample packets for lab test. “The test results confirmed that those tobacco items were ‘unsafe’ and they should not be consumed,” she said. Kalaivani said the department will send ‘show cause’ notice to those go-down owners and shopkeepers for selling banned items. Action will be initiated against them if they failed to respond to the notice.
 
 The central government has banned all kinds of chewing tobacco products. The state government has instructed food safety department officials to initiate stern action against shopkeepers who sell banned items. The state government has also ordered not to use tobacco and nicotine as ingredients in any food product under the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations Act of 2011.
 
 The officials from the Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administrative Department (TNFSDAD) are conducting surprise raids often across their concerned districts on shops and stores selling chewing tobacco in its various forms.
