Delhi/Panaji: With Inland   Authority of India (IWAI) commencing preparatory works on 106 additional national waterways (NWs), tenders for construction of jetties in Goa would be taken up shortly.

 Goa’s waterways, (NW-68, Mandovi, NW-111, Zuari and NW-27, Cumbharjua Canal) are included in the ambitious plan of nationalization of waterways to boost this mode of transportation.
 
 The state had long distance services for commuters from Panaji to Aldona, Divar, Sanvordem and other places during the Portuguese era and till a few years after liberation. But the advent of road transport on a bigger scale and other factors meant the use of rivers decreased slowly. 
 
 The nationalization of rivers has raised apprehensions of loss of control over the navigable areas as well as the land along the route. 
 
 Fishermen’s bodies have opposed the proposal, alleging it would affect their livelihood due to construction of jetties and increase in traffic in the waterways.
 
 The Union government has declared the rivers Zuari, Mandovi, Sal, Mapusa-Moira, Chapora and Cumbharjua as national waterways.
 
 But chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had assured in October 2016 that the MoU between the state and IWAI hasn’t been signed yet due to opposition from the public. The stakeholders would be taken into confidence, he had stated.
 
 Goa Forward and the Congress had held rallies in some areas of Salcete, raising a banner of protest against the proposed nationalization.
 
 Former public works department (PWD) minister and MGP leader, Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had defended the nationalization, stating that it would benefit Goa and all six rivers would be dredged.
