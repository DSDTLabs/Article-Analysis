BHOPAL: In an unusual gesture, a man from  's   district threw a party for his son who had flunked his Class 10 exams on Monday because he wanted to "motivate" the teenager to perform better. Earlier in the day, the MP board of secondary education had declared the results for the exams and within a few hours at least seven students had committed suicide. 

 
 Civil contractor Surendra Kumar Vyas invited his relatives and friends for the surprise bash and only after reaching the venue did the guests realise that he had thrown the party for his son  . "This is how I want to motivate my son. After failing in exams, children go into depression and some even commit suicide. I want to tell such children that boards are not the last exam," Vyas said.
 
 "My son can reappear in the exam again next year and with hard work can get better marks," he added. 
 
 "I love my father and promise to study hard in this academic session so that I pass with flying colours," Ashu, a student of Saraswati Shishu Mandir, told TOI.
