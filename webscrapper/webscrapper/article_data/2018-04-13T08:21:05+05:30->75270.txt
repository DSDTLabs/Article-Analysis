KOLKATA : Unplanned   on both flanks, buses flouting bus-lanes, passengers waiting on the road instead of busstand and autorickshaws refusing to stand at demarcated stops has made the   crossing a nightmare not only for locals but also cops.

 Locals said the death of Biswanath Halder, who lost his life in a minibus accident on Wednesday, was waiting to happen.
 
  
 After spending a few hours at Acropolis Mall, TOI found out most buses were not stopping at the designated bus stop. “The bus stop on the flank leading to Gariahat is located close to busy crossing. As a result, if more than two buses cross the signal, the third bus either ends up violating the bus bay or overtake others in a bid to pick up more passengers,” claimed Chaiti Sarkar, an employee of an electronics giant. Her office is located nearby.
 
 Worse, the spot designated for the auto drivers to park their vehicles is barely 15 metres from the crossing. “The autorickshaws often spill over and occupy the space designated for bus passengers. People who work nearby, often leave their vehicles behind and the autos do not get enough parking space. They eventually end up eating into the bus shelter space,” claimed  , a senior citizen residing in the   area.
 
 Police sources admitted that lane driving too was a major issue. “Buses rarely drive on the left lane. Since the road engineering at this place is faulty, the approach to Acropolis remains one of the most constricted on the Rashbehari connector. With vehicles parked on both flanks, the road space effectively comes down leaving motorists with just one-and-a-half lanes on each flank,” said a senior officer of traffic police department.
 
 “We have decided to push the auto stand near Acropolis towards Gariahat and will put up designated road furniture to ensure buses take the bus bays. We are also increasing our presence during office hours and weekends,” said an officer.
