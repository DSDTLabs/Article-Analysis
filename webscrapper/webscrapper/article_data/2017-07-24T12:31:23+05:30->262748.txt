NAGPUR: In general perception,   can act as a mobilizer for patients improving muscular strength. But as per Dr  , it can be a life saver too. While he believes physiotherapy is an underrated branch, he delivered a talk on physiotherapy from the perspective of an intensivist.

 Deshpande, on Sunday, delivered 25th Dr VR Paithankar Memorial Oration on ‘Improving chest therapy in ICU –What’s new?’ at  , Dharampeth. 
 
 He suggested, “The intensivists need to make discretion at the right time and rope in the physiotherapist at an early stage. While, the role of physiotherapy comes in the end, studies have proved that if it is introduced at an early stage, the outcome will be better.”
 
 He had an opinion that the physiotherapy given in adjacent with chest therapy, gives better outcome. He said, “During bacterial as well as viral infection, while the patient is suffering from pneumonia or swine flu, a situation may come when the patients are given mechanical ventilation (MV). Generally physiotherapy is given when the patient is off the ventilator.”
 
 He then said, “But researches have shown that, if the physiotherapy is given while the patient is breathing on MV. At such times, the physiotherapy is being seen acting as adjuvant (enhancing body’s immune response). The patient requires less oxygen, gets off the ventilator faster, and develops the ability to cough out.”
 
 There are certain apparatus in physiotherapy which will help the patient with oxygenation and promote airway clearance, he said.
 
 He said, “Such instruments are available in market but are rarely seen in respiratory centres. The doctors need to introduce them in their set-up to get better outcome in patients. The issue is that such machines are expensive in present scenario as they may cost more than Rs15 to 20 lakh. But in coming years the trend will catch-up in India.”
