In the parallel list released by  , Gope has been declared candidate from the same constituency. There were allegations that Beni had exploited his proximity with Mulayam to secure the seat for Rakesh.
 
 In his letter sent to the EC, Beni has accused the minister for rural development of colluding with the district police chief to ensure posting of police station in charges belonging to his caste. He said the minister first got a district police chief of his caste posted in Barabanki, who in turn replaced most of the police stations in charge hours before the model code of conduct was enforced.
