RANCHI: Industrialists and dignitaries visiting the city to attend the global investors’ summit, Momentum Jharakhand, in their chartered aircraft may have to struggle for space at the Birsa Munda Airport.

 The city airport will not be able to hold the number of chartered aircraft expected to arrive in the city during the business summit on February 16 and 17. The administration plans to send most of these aircraft in Jamshedpur and Gaya.
 
 Even as preparations for the summit have gained pace and the airport is being repainted and cleaned, infrastructural deficiencies have come a cropper for the state. The city airport has only one hangar and one runway for the aircraft. According to sources, the hangar is only used for parking by the BSF, aviation authorities and the state government whereas private aircraft are parked on the Foxtrot taxiway which is running out of space.
 
 Airport director,  , said, “Though there is only one runway it has the capacity to handle an increase in traffic. On the other hand, the Foxtrot taxiway on which the aircraft are parked is operating close to its maximum capacity and we could run out of space. In such a situation we will either arrange for parking space in Gaya or in Jamshedpur. The aircraft will then have to fly from the neighbouring cities to our airport.”
 
 The airport handles 14 flights every day. Vikram added that an overhaul of the airport’s infrastructure to accommodate such pressure would take at least a year or two. “We don’t have so much time before the business summit,” He added.
 
 At present the city airport has five parking bays while there are plans to construct three more.
 
 Summit organisers are yet to inform the airport authorities about landing schedules of the visitors. The airport, which has the capacity of as many as 500 passengers, is expected to be full during the summit.
 
 A special helipad has also been built in Khelgaon to lessen the burden on the city airport.
