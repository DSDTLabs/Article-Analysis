CHANDIGARH: Experts at the school for public health (SPH) at the PGIMER have published studies saying dry foliage from the city at the landfill site of   is adding to   gas emission levels. This emission will grow over the years with continued dumping of organic waste. 

 Environmental studies experts at Panjab University (PU) and the SPH estimated that the city generates around 400 tons per day of waste which produces methane emission of 340 million grams per year. 
 
 “This emission is expected to increase with the rise in organic waste like the leaves and other foliage. Leaves are highly biodegradable waste and if temperatures are high, methane which is being emitted from the waste in the landfill can cause sudden fire,” said Dr  , SPH, who has been working on environment public health. 
 
 Methane gas is a significant contributor to  . It adds to the hot climate 23 times more than carbon dioxide. 
 
 The recent fires at the Dadumajra dumping ground have become a routine affair for locals. 
 
 “There is a pattern which we have observed that methane gas emission enhances and reaches a peak after 7-8 years at the landfills. Therefore, if the landfill is dumped with organic and inorganic waste at Dadumajra, the global warming gas will increase,” said Dr Khaiwal.
 
 Dr Suman Mor, of PU’s department of environmental studies and Khaiwal both concluded in a study that the dumping process is unscientific as the waste is not segregated.
