AHMEDABAD: The   party on Sunday came out heavily against the state government over degrading quality of primary education. The party highlighted the recent   (NAS) carried out by NCERT, where it was observed that in   41% of the students of class 3 can’t count up to 999, while an equal number of children in class 5 could not count up to 1,000. 

 “Around 40 % of children of class 3,5 and 8, the NAS report states, could not answer basic questions pertaining to language, science and environmental science respectively,” said Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi. 
 
 Doshi later said, “This dismal condition of our education system is because teachers are not motivated to teach. Less pay, lesser opportunities for skill upgradation, engaging teachers in government campaigns and immunisation drives. Besides this, shutting down government high schools and aided schools, allowing private schools to charge any fees they desire have dealt a heavy blow to our education system.”
