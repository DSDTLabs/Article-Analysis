 ( ) had an amazing time shooting for ' ' in Spain. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I have always been adventurous and enjoyed being a part of this show,” she tells us.

 Known for her style and elegance, she also displayed tremendous grit and determination during the shoot. She also bonded well with the team. She says, “I got along well with the whole team. My bonding with the local crew was even better because I was the only one among the participants who knew Spanish. We would all party every Saturday night, the manager and the DJ became my friends there. The minute I walked in to the club, they would start playing Punjabi songs. We would get tables for free because the club guy liked me (laughs). They hugged me and cried when I was leaving. They gave me souvenirs to remember them. I made a family there in those six weeks... they are still in touch with me.”
 
 The reality show, she says, has helped her evolve as a person and made her more patient. “We always take it easy when we have a backup plan in life. But I didn’t have an option on 'Khatron Ke Khiladi'. I really pushed myself while performing on the show. The experience has made me realise that a human mind is capable of doing so much and we don’t know what we are capable of unless we find ourselves in that situation. There was no way out for me in Spain and my never-give-up attitude helped me a lot,” she says.
 
  also upped the glam quotient on the show. Despite the gruelling outdoor stunts, she came out looking stunning. “I would always make an effort to look stylish because the beauty queen inside me can’t be taken out. I come from a profession that requires me to look my best always. Also, I have been a part of several pageants — both national and international —and when you come from a space where you have competed with the best of each country, you understand the importance of maintaining oneself,” she signs off.
