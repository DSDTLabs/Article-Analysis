VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam   Airport (VTZ) has registered a big growth in the number of international fliers, as per the latest air traffic report. 

 According to the report, a total 14,351 international passengers travelled through VTZ in January 2018 as against 10,221 in the corresponding period of 2017. In the month of January alone, VTZ has registered a 40.4% growth this year compared to last year’s figures.
 
 Overall between April 2017 and January 2018, VTZ witnessed a total of 1,10,895 international passengers. The corresponding figure in 2016-17 (April-January) was only 81,650, which is a growth rate of 35.8%.
 
 The growth rate is attributed to several reasons, which includes an increase in the number of international flights from VTZ to international destinations like Singapore, Colombo, Malaysia, Dubai among others. While the   registered 158 international flights in January 2018, the number was 122 in January 2017. Overall, 1,421 international flights took off from   between April-January in 2017-18, against 1,191 in the corresponding period of 2016-17.
 
 In terms of serving international passengers the airport has achieved a healthy growth, but it has not maintained the same tempo when it comes to serving domestic passengers, said Kuppili  , a frequent air traveller who is an application analyst in a IT company.
 
 As per the air traffic report, while 2,12,554 domestic passengers travelled through VTZ in January 2018, the number was 2,10,085 in January last year, which is a growth of only 1.2%. Overall, only 19,25,213 passengers travelled from Vizag between April 2017 to January 2018, against 18,96,176 passengers in the same period of 2016-17 — a growth rate of just 1.5%.
 
 While 1,623 domestic flights took off from the city in January 2018, it was 1,644 flights in January last year, which is a decline of 1.3%. Similarly, the airport registered 14,516 flights between April to January (2017-18) while the number was more last year — 15,088 flights between April to January (2016-17).
 
 “The decline in domestic flights and poor growth rate of domestic passengers is mainly due to cancellation of flights by the operators due to various factors,” said O  , vice-president of Andhra Pradesh Air Travellers’ Association.
 
 Ravi Teja demanded introduction of direct flights to Dubai and Bangkok to meet the growing demand. “At the same time, immigration officials at VTZ also need to be given a course in professionalism. They are often rude to passengers. Due to such issues, many passengers, including my family members, prefer taking international flights from Hyderabad and Bangalore,” Ravi Teja told TOI.
 
 When contacted, a senior Vizag airport official said, “Yes, the number of international fliers and flights have gone up. We constantly act on feedback from passengers and have been trying our best to make it one of the most passenger-friendly airports in the country.”
