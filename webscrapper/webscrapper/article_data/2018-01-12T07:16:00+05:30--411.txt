Noida: Noida Authority on Thursday launched a campaign against illegal hoardings, kiosks and posters in the city, during which three leading mobile manufacturing companies were fined for more than Rs 15 lakh. 

 The companies whose hoardings are located in Sector 18 have been issued notices and directed to remove their hoardings and advertisements immediately and deposit the fine with the Authority within a week or face action. 
 
 According to officials, each and every crossing, roundabout, roadside and other public places will be surveyed for unauthorised hoardings. 
 
 “The drive will be launched in the city’s 10 circles against illegal hoardings, kiosks and posters so that the city remains ‘free of eyesores’,” said Rajesh Singh, officer on special duty, Noida Authority. “For starters, the project engineer of Circle-2 has scanned Sector 18 and issued three notices. Once they are removed, vigilance will be maintained against offenders and deterrent action continued to be taken,” he added.
 
 Mishra told TOI while one company has been fined Rs 3.27 lakh, the second was fined Rs 8.75 lakh and the third Rs 3.09 lakh. “The fine has been calculated according to the square metres the hoarding covers and the advertising rate of Noida Authority, which is Rs 218.63 per square metres per month. 
 
 “The companies have been asked to remove the hoardings immediately and pay the fine within seven days. If they fail to do any we will take further action. We will recover our fine and also take down the hoardings,” he added.
