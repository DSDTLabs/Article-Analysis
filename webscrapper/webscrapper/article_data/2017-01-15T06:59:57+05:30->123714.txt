AMRITSAR: Former   ( ) leader and noted eye surgeon Dr Daljit Singh joined the Congress in Amritsar on Saturday. Dr Daljit was the chairperson of AAP’s disciplinary committee in Punjab before he fell out with the party’s top brass.

  He had contested the 2014   elections as an AAP candidate from Amritsar against   chief Captain  , who welcomed him into the party.
 
 Talking to the media at the event organized to announce Daljit’s induction into the party, Amarinder said, “Our party will be further strengthened with his entry.” Amarinder said it was clear AAP did not trust the people of Punjab, since its campaign was “managed by outsiders”.
 
 Daljit was expelled from AAP in July 2015 as its Punjab disciplinary committee chairman and state executive member for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities. At the joining on Saturday, Daljit termed AAP convener   as a “dangerous person for the country”. “I have decided to join Congress to ensure that AAP doesn’t win even a single seat in the ensuing assembly elections,” he said.
 
 Daljit, who had accused former AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur and party’s Punjab affairs in charge Sanjay Singh of trying to ruin the party, said he was completely disillusioned by the way AAP was functioning under Kejriwal. He claimed that he was removed from AAP because he objected to its way of functioning and warned of a vertical split, which had subsequently happened.
 
 A large number of other AAP supporters and BJP councillor Anoop also joined Congress. They included AAP induction wing president Jatinder Modgill and zonal coordinator Jatin Sood.
