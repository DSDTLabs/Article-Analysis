THANE: The state government on Monday released an instalment of Rs 2 crore for the makeover of Mumbra-Kalwa  . The place that was once encroached upon will now be turned into a promenade and a sprawling chowpatty.

 District collector   on Monday handed over the cheque to the   (TMC) to begin the first phase of the beautification drive. The TMC had recently pulled down illegal settlements and commercial units that had come up on the creek front.
 
 “This will help curb illegal sand dredging issues and pollution of the creek. The money for the project has been provided from the tourism fund. We have asked Mantralaya to allocate an additional Rs 30 crore to ensure timely completion of the project. The state has responded to our request and has given an approval,” Kalyankar said.
 
 He added that the task of rehabilitating displaced families will be handled by the municipal administration.
