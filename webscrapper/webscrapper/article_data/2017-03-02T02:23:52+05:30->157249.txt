NEW DELHI: The CBI has questioned NRI defence consultant and alleged middleman in the $208 million (Rs 1,350 crore)   aircraft deal,  , over alleged bribe paid to swing the deal in favour of the company, the route of payments made to him and other details about meetings with defence ministry officials, top sources told TOI. 

 In its FIR registered in October last year to probe the scandal, the CBI named Khanna as one of the main accused. It has been alleged that Khanna received $5.76 million as commission — which is now being treated as “kickbacks” — from the Sao Paulo-based firm to influence defence ministry and DRDO officials for the deal. The deal was signed in July 2008. 
 
 CBI sources said the 87-year-old Khanna was called to the agency’s headquarters recently and examined for several hours about the scam, in which he allegedly played the crucial role of mediator. The agency also recently visited the US and collected crucial documents from there as the US department of justice is probing Embraer’s alleged violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It has also written to Brazilian authorities for information while a lookout circular was issued against Khanna last year. The CBI suspects that money paid as kickbacks to Khanna were routed through Austria and Switzerland and there could be other beneficiaries in the deal.
