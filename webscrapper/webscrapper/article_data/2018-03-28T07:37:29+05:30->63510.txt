KOLKATA: The Bidhannagar cops came to the rescue of 20 Higher Secondary examiness, who had reached the wrong examination centre on Tuesday morning. They finally reached the original venue within 10 minutes with the help of the officers. The students were only five minutes late and were allowed to sit for the exam.

 According to a student of Patipukur Pallyshri Boys’ School, when they reached Adyanath Boys’ School on Tuesday morning and showed their admit cards to the security guard at the gate, they realised their mistake. “We came to the wrong centre and it was a bolt from the blue for us,” said a student who did not want to be named.
 
 “Adyanath Boys’ School in Patipukur had been the HS centre for the students of our school for the last few years. But this year, our centre is Krishnapur Adarsha Vidyamandir. None of us crosschecked it and landed at the wrong centre,” said a student.
 
 Fear gripped them as their  . They were clueless about reaching the actual exam centre on time. Some parents wanted authorities to allow their children to sit at that centre only as they did not have enough time to reach the actual venue.
 
 There was also a student with physical disabilities. While the students and guardians panicked, two sub-inspectors from   police station came to know about the trouble. The duo,   and Surojit Haldar, rushed to the spot and took the students to Krishnapur Adarsha Vidyamandir within 10 minutes.
