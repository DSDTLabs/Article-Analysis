CHENNAI: The   (TTDC)'s   tour remains the favourite destination among the 30-odd packages offered by it, seeing a 15.32% increase in 2017-18 over the previous year's bookings.

 Data from the TTDC shows that while the Tirupati and   treks remain highly popular, several other tours offered by it have lost takers. Bookings for Tirupati increased to 33,593 in 2017-18 from 29,082 in the previous year. 
 
 But the once popular 108 Amman tour had only 67 bookings while even bookings through TTDC to destinations like   and   fizzled out in 2017-18. The famed city tour, which offers a half-day trip to places in Chennai, also saw a decrease in bookings - from 1791 in 2016-17 to 1427 in 2017-18.
 
 "For Tirupati alone, we get nearly 130 bookings each day, and on the weekends, we have all the 150 booking slots filled," said a TTDC official. The official added that nearby destinations like Mamallapuram have seen people use their own vehicles, along with a spurt in private transport. "However, hotels at such destinations are seeing full bookings."
 
 "Our prices remain competitive, and service is on par with that of private operators," said an official, adding that the current fleet strength of 11 air-conditioned and   buses would be raised to 13 this year.
 
 Officials said the loss of patronage was due to the lack of publicity given to tour packages and the constant decrease in fleet strength. There have been no efforts to set up booking kiosks at crowded places like Chennai Central, Egmore and CMBT. 
 
 N Ravi, former manager-tours with TTDC, said the strength of the fleet two decades ago was 35 and additional coaches were sourced from private operators, but the fleet strength fell down the years to eleven this year. "There can be a dozen tours that are attractive but enough should be done to publicise them. Only then will visitors to the city know and want to embark on such tours," he said.
