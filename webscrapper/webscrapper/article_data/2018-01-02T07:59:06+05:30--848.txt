NEW DELHI:   on Monday latched on to President Donald Trump’s outburst against Pakistan to hit back at   president  , who had taken swipe at Prime Minister   after the US president hailed Pakistan in mid October last year. 

 “Donald Trump slamming Pakistan is a huge victory for Indian diplomacy under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has united the world community in his campaign against terror,” said BJP’s national media coordinator Anil Baluni. 
 
 The BJP leader said Trump’s strongly worded statement has exposed Pakistan’s role in patronising terror outfits and it also shows that the world community shares concerns expressed by India. 
 
 “The Prime Minister has raised the issue of terrorism from various platforms after which Pakistan has been isolated,” Baluni said. Trump tweeted on Monday, “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”
