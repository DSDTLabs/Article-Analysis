Ours is a participative democracy, and every few years, citizens get the right to vote. A democracy is meant to be   of all the people who make it. To that purpose, only if every eligible voter votes, will the representation be complete. If whole sets of people don’t turn up to vote, then the representative who is elected is not truly representative. For example, if the young   doesn’t vote, that’s a loss of representation. Similarly, if those who have made Bengaluru their temporary home do not turn up to vote, that’s a loss as well.
Those who do not vote, do not participate in the governance structure that will fall into place, and do not have a voice in the election process, and certainly not in the armchair-critique process that many of us indulge in when something goes wrong.
 An election brings forth the ability for all of us to show our sense of belonging to the social, economic and political structure that will govern us in the near-term future. Participation in an election gives us a sense of ownership and belonging. Bengaluru will boast 24% new voters on the voting lists as opposed to 2013. Just imagine the vibrancy of the voting process if every one of them turns up to vote. I sometimes wonder why we so diligently do things that are compulsory by law, and don’t do things that are not mandated compulsorily, like the right to vote. That is a pathos point, for sure. The passion to vote seems inversely proportionate to education. In the last elections in 2013, Bengaluru Urban district had a 57.38 % turnout. Is it going to be different this year round? Up or down?
 If you belong to a place, the best way to express that belongingness is by turning up to vote. It says a lot — I care, I feel, and most importantly, I belong.
