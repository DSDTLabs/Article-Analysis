Whereas 1,930 girls with Class X qualifications received the assistance of Rs 25,000 and the same weight of gold. The total value of the financial assistance and the gold coins issued last year was Rs 15.97 crore.
 
 “This scheme, besides providing financial assistance and gold, ensures higher education to girls in rural areas. The incidences of girls dropping out are also coming down,” said district collector K Rajamani in his statement on Tuesday.
