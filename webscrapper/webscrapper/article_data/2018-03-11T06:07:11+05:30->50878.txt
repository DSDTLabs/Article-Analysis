CHENNAI: After a senior official from the   ( ) inspected the Moolakothalam burial ground on Saturday, residents of nearby areas protested at the proposal that the ground is used by   (TNSCB) for developing tenements.

 The protesters said the burial ground not only caters to people from nearby areas but also has a playground used by players as well school and college students for playing.
 
 
 “This 48-acre land has been used for burying by people from Moolakothalam and nearby areas like Basin Bridge, Konthithope, Mint, Pulianthope for generations now. There is already not enough space for all the burials and they want a construction project to take off here. It is ridiculous,” said  , a pastor from a nearby Church.
 
 Residents said the burial ground has been in use for nearly 130 years.
 
 Noting that the next burial ground is10km away in Otteri, residents submitted petitions toL Murugan, vicepresident of NCSC.
 
 Murugan then proceeded to visit the   hostel for girls in   which is one of the 1300-odd hostels run by the department in the state.
 
 According to students, overcrowding and poor quality of food are just two of the many issues facing them.
 
 “How are we supposed to study if such is the place we live in? We are worried whether to take food as the quality is poor,” said a PG student at the hostel.
 
 Another student said since there was no other option, students from poor families were forced to stay. He complained that students are not provided with access to basic amenities.
 
 L Murugan said based on petitions and grievances raised by the people and students, steps would be taken. Accordingly, directions will be issued to the state machinery, he added.
