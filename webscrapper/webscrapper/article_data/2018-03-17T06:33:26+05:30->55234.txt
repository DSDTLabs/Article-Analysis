PANAJI: Health minister   on Friday said that he is confident the “government will find some way to restart mining in the state of Goa”. 

 “I think everybody, right from the PM’s office, is aware of the implications and impact on people dependent on mining. The issue is how do you take it forward to address the problem of the mining dependents. I come from the mining belt and I’m concerned. People have trucks and barges, and I’m confident that the BJP will find a way forward along with our allies,” he told reporters on Friday, adding that he is holding meetings of mining dependents in every constituency and ward, especially in places like   and Honda.
 
 On the immediate solution, he said Vijai Sardesai, Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar and Francis D’Souza are discussing the matter where   is also coming to Goa. 
 
 “All of them will sit together and I’m confident they will find some way to restart mining in Goa. This cannot be done by us here. There has to be an integrated effort between the central and state governments, and I’m confident the Prime Minister, knowing all these issues, will help our people of Goa,” he said on Friday.
