HYDERABAD: A day after a family died in a suicide pact in Secunderabad, police have discovered that 37-year-old goldsmith   and his wife  , 30, directly fed poison to their children —  , 5, and a fivemonth-old baby boy — without mixing it in any food.

 Police suspect the couple might have used cyanide, a poisonous chemical used in the process of gold plating, to commit suicide.
 
 According to police, the family, natives of Howrah in  , might have committed suicide between 2pm and 8pm on Friday.
 
 “The family was staying in a1BHK flat at Kandoji Bazar in Secunderabad. The neighbours knocked their door, but there was no response even as TV was blaring. After that, they informed us. We broke open the door and found their bodies in the bedroom,” Mahankali inspector B Ramesh.
 
 Swaroop had shifted to Hyderabad two years ago. So far, police did not find any suicide note. However, they suspect financial problem might have led the family to commit suicide. “We are still waiting for their relatives to arrive in the city to ascertain why they committed suicide. It appears to be financial problems as the family had not paid rent for the past six months,” the inspector added.
 
 The bodies were shifted to   for autopsy and a case under Section 174 (suspicious death) was registered.
