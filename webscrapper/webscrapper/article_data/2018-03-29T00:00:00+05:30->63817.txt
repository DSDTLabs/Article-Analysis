Chennai: In a reprieve to Kalanithi Maran, the Madras high court on Wednesday set aside an order of the income tax department declaring him the principal officer of SpiceJet, which made him liable for the TDS defaults by the company.

 Justice M Duraiswamy passed the order while allowing a plea moved by Maran challenging the I-T order dated November 3, 2010.
 
 Claiming that he was only a non-executive chairman of the company who has no say in the day-to-day administration, Maran said he had not even signed a single document on behalf of SpiceJet filed with the I-T department.
 
 This apart, pointing out that the company had a fulltime managing director to handle the administration, he said, “The managing director himself has written to the department explaining the facts. While so, how can I be declared the principal officer and made liable for the tax dues of the firm.”
 
 Opposing his contentions, the I-T department submitted that just because the company had a managing director, it did not mean that the chairman/director did not take part in the management of the company.
 
 Recording the submissions, Justice Duraiswamy said, “Though Maran and his company were holding more than 50% shares, in the absence of any material to establish that he was in charge of the day-to-day affairs, management, and administration of the company, the I-T department should not have named him as the principal officer. The managing director of the company has also stated that Maran was only a non-executive director in the company, based in Chennai, and was not involved with the day-to-day management of the company.”
 
 According to the managing director, Maran has not made any visits to the company till date as he does not draw any salary or remuneration from the company. He attends board meetings only in the capacity of non-executive director, for which, he does not even get any sitting fees, the judge pointed out.
