AHMEDABAD: Blame the   for more than half of the crime in the city! Crimes cracked in Ahmedabad for 2016 and 2017 reveal that out of 3,171 arrested in the two years, over 55% were from outside the city.

 Larger role of local criminals was found only in two crimes – chain snatching and robbery which were carried out by 70% and 53 % local residents respectively. Cops said that 60% of accused arrested for serious crimes like dacoity, abduction/ extortion, illegal arms hailed from outside Ahmedabad.
 
 Robberies, house break-ins and theft using deception were carried out mainly by gangs operating from outside  . Cops arrested 265 from Rajasthan, 260 from UP, 94 from Madhya Pradesh and 56 from Maharashtra for these crimes.
 
 Top cops say Gujarat is seen as a rich society which works as a magnet for gangs to make a quick buck by striking and scooting. “Gangs flying and driving into the city in plush vehicles too have been busted in recent past,” a senior official said.
 
 Deepan Bhadran, DCP (crime), said that in past two years, a good number of inter-state gangs involved in crimes in multiple states were busted. “We have also found strong regional connect as far as modus operandi is concerned – those coming from Tamil Nadu were found to hoodwink the citizens for thefts from vehicles whereas a gang from Bihar was involved solely in theft of electronic goods,” he said.
 
 Bhadran added that interstate coordination has improved the rate of arrests especially in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra. “We also help officials of other states find wanted in their cases who take shelter in the city,” he said. Crime branch officials said that technology has also played a major role in tracking down the accused and reduce recidivism.
