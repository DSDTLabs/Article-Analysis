NOIDA: A proposal by the Noida Authority that   should bear 25% of the   of solid   management through compost machines was rejected by the latter who questioned why they should share the funds when they were already paying taxes. 

 The proposal was made at a meeting between the RWA Federation, RWA NCR and the additional CEO of Noida Authority, R K Mishra, on Tuesday in Sector 6. 
 
 At the meeting, five companies for solid   were introduced to the RWA delegation. Sources said the authority proposed that it would fund 75 % of the treatment and the RWAs would have to bear the remaining cost. The RWAs opposed the plan on the ground that the authority did not recognise them and instead demanded a trial of the compost machines before they were installed.
 
 “We held a meeting with the RWAs on solid waste management. We explained to them that since we are already collecting waste from the residential sectors, we will continue to do so with compost machines. We proposed that 75 % of the cost be borne us and the rest by the RWAs,” Mishra said. 
 
 The authority reportedly suggested that the RWAs raise the amount through earnings from community centres. Mishra said the authority would soon send solid waste treatment rules for high-rise apartments and residential sectors. 
 
 The RWA Federation questioned the proposal. “We’ve been asking for legal rights on lines of gram sabhas. Right now, we dont have any recognition from the Noida Authority. So, how can we implement a process on solid waste management in residential sectors? Why should the RWAs bear 25 % of the cost of SWM when it is the duty of the authority. After all, we pay taxes for it,” said NP Singh, president Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations.
