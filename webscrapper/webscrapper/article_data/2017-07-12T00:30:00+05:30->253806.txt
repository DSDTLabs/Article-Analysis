Patiala: High drama was witnessed outside a house in the Doctors Enclave here on Tuesday when an armed   flashed a countrymade pistol and managed to give police the slip, taking along the articles stolen from the house. 

 As the owners of the house had gone away on vacation, a thief managed to break inside their house. However, a passerby spotted the thief inside the house and informed the cops. Immediately, two cops on a motorbike reached the spot and parked their bike in front of the thief’s bike. But the thief took out a countrymade pistol and started threatening the two cops, who by that time had taken out the ignition key of the thief’s bike.

After sometime the thief left his motorbike behind and manage to flee from the scene. Meanwhile, a number of neighbours gathered at the spot and one of them even captured the whole incident on his mobile phone. The video was later uploaded on the social media and it went viral.
