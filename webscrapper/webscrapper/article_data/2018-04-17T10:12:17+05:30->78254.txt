LUCKNOW: Hours after   Anupriya Patel’s husband and   (S) chief   filed his nomination papers for council elections, his mother-in-law and Apna Dal president   said that there was no scope for reconciliation between the two parties and that she would fight against the BJP ally in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 BJP had given one MLC seat to its ally Apna Dal (S) after the latter supported the saffron party in Rajya Sabha elections.
 
 “All such wild speculations of reconciliation between us are totally baseless and false,” mother of Union junior minister for health,   told TOI. “We have no political relations with Apna Dal (S) and will field our own candidates in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections,” said Krishna.
 
 When TOI contacted Ashish, he refused to comment saying that he would speak on the issue later. The BJP wnats a reconciliation between Apna Dal and Apna Dal (S) ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections fearing an electoral loss due to splitting of Kurmi votes.
 
 Sources said that Krishna Patel had been approached by Samajwadi Party during Phulpur byelection.
