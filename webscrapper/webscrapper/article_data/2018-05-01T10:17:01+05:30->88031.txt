CHENNAI: The state school education department has told the district collectors to withdraw recognition of schools which operate in unsafe buildings and accommodate students from these institutions in nearby schools. 

 
 A seven-member committee headed by the respective Chief Educational Officers (CEOs) has been formed in all the districts to carry out inspections in this regard and ensure that schools do not violate the National Building Code, 2005.
 
 This move comes against the backdrop of the Madras high court directing the department to take necessary steps so that all the schools conform to requisite building regulations and safety norms. 
 
 A check list has been prepared by the school education department to carry out inspections at all schools including nursery, play schools and schools affiliated to CBSE, ICSE etc. A mobile app has also been developed for use by the team. 
 
 Despite efforts taken to include important provisions in the check list, the court observed that since the list is not a comprehensive one, the field officers have been given liberty to include left over item. 
 
 The school education department in its letter to the collector has requested police protection in case of resistance from school authorities. 
 
  A   from CHANGEindia, the organisation which filed the   said hundreds of illegal schools are being operated in all kinds of buildings, promoting all kinds of unrealistic facilities and features to gullible parents. 
 
 “These schools neither possess affiliation to CBSE nor recognition from the state school education department. Several notorious enterprises with headquarters situated at neighbouring states operate from buildings constructed without plan approval or taken on lease, commercial spaces,” he added.
