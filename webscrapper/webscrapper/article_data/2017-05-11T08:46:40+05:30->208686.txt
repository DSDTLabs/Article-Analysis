CHENNAI: With metro rail opening an 8km   on Sunday , a ride from   to  , that covers a distance of 23km, could cost less than `70. It means the commuters will have to shell out just `2.8 per km for the ride on the stretch.

 A metro rail official said the maximum ticket price for phase-I of the metro rail project has been capped at `70.
 
 “It may cost around `65 for the longest distance which is between Nehru Park and airport on the current underground line,“ the official said.
 
 The city's first underground metro line between Nehru Park and Koyambedu covers a distance of about 8km with seven stations.
 
 At present, a metro ride could cost a minimum of `10 and a maximum of `50, which is charged for a ride between Koyambedu and Airport. When inaugurated, the new Nehru Park to Koyambedu underground line will connect to the already operational Koyambedu-Alandur-St Thomas Mount elevated line. Commuters can changeover at Alandur to trains on Little Mount-airport line to get to the airport.
 
 The services will allow people to get to the airport or Alandur, which costs approximately `362 by Ola Mini and `263 by Uber. Though the distance by road is lesser than the metro line, people will be able to beat the traffic at Koyambedu and 100ft Road and reach southern destinations in the city quicker by metro trains. It will take around an hour for commuters to reach the airport after a changeover at Alandur metro.
 
 Though the metro ride between the two stations is cheaper than compared to taking a cab, the price is still on the higher side compared to Delhi Metro (DMRC).
 
 DMRC revised it ticket fares by increasing its minimum fare from `8 to `10 and the maximum from `30 to `50. Commuters will have to pay `10 for a distance of up to 2km while it may cost `50 to travel a stretch of more than 32km.
