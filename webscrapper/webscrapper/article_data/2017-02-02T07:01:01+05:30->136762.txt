AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: Gujarat's two decades old dream to have it’s own   (AIIMS) was fulfilled when it was announced in the Union Budget 2017-18 on Wednesday. Sources in state health department said that AIIMS Gujarat is most likely to come up in Rajkot.

 Gujarat minister of state for health,  , said that the demand for an AIIMS-like institution in Gujarat was pending for over 20 years. “The central government has finally fulfilled this demand,” he said.
 
 Principal health secretary Pankaj Kumar said preliminary work on setting up AIIMS in Gujarat has been going on for quite some time. “Sites — two in Rajkot and one in Vadodara — have been identified. Each of these sites has an area of over 200 acres. Now that AIIMS Gujarat has been announced in the Union Budget, one of the sites will be shortlisted soon,” Kumar said.
 
 Highly placed sources in the state government confirmed that AIIMS Gujarat will come up in Rajkot. “AIIMS will come in Rajkot as Saurashtra region lacks a major tertiary care center and there has been an old demand for such a hospital,” a source told TOI.
 
 AIIMS Gujarat will be a 1,000-bed hospital with a medical college. The college will have all the super-speciality departments required at a tertiary care center. It is estimated that the hospital will cost Rs 1500 crore to build.
 
 Health commissioner JP Gupta said that it would be built phase-wise, beginning with a 300-bed hospital with a medical college. “AIIMS Gujarat will give a big boost to quality tertiary care in the state,” Gupta said.
 
 Dileep Patel, president,  , Rajkot chapter, said Saurashtra deserves AIIMS as the region, including Kutch, covers one third of the state’s total population. “Rajkot is an ideal location for AIIMS,” he said.
 
 “The central committee that visited Rajkot also gave a favorable report regarding setting up AIIMS in Rajkot. 
 
 We don’t have super-speciality services in the Civil Hospital and patients have to go to Ahmedabad for that,” Gupta said.
