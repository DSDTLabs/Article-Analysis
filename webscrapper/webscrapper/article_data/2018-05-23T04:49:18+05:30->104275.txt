MUMBAI: State Bank of India ( ) reported its largest ever quarterly loss of Rs 7,718 crore for January-March 2018 on Tuesday — more than double the Rs 3,442-crore loss reported for Q4FY17. The jump in losses follows a Rs 24,080-crore provision towards bad loans after the RBI scrapped all loan restructuring schemes. The bank also had to make a Rs 4,761-crore provision towards depreciation in the value of its bond portfolio. 

 
 Although the reported loss was much higher than the Rs 2,000 crore expected by the market, the bank’s stock rose to close nearly 4% higher at Rs 254 on the BSE after the bank said that the size of its stressed assets watch list is only Rs 25,802 crore and that the country’s largest lender has left the worst behind.
 
 For the full year ended March 2018, the bank reported a net loss of Rs 6,547 crore as against a loss of Rs 1,805 crore in FY17. So the figure for FY18 is the second-consecutive and largest ever full-year loss for the lender. Loans in FY18 grew 3.5% to Rs 19.3 lakh crore, while deposits grew 4.7% to just over Rs 27 lakh crore. 
 
 SBI’s losses are second only to Punjab National Bank’s record Rs 13,417-crore quarterly loss reported last week on the back of the   fraud. According to Sharekhan AVP (research)  , the SBI watch list is only 1.3% of its loans. “Going forward, we believe that the bulk of pain in terms of   (non-performing loan) recognition is behind for SBI,” he said.
 
 Announcing the results, SBI chairman,   said, “We have put the past behind us. Last year was a year of disappointment. This (FY19) is a year of hope and we expect that FY20 will be a year of happiness.” 
 
 He said that the compounded annual growth rate for loans would accelerate to 12% by 2020, and gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio would be brought below 6% in the same period.
 
 The chairman struck an optimistic note on asset quality, pointing out that he expected substantial recoveries from bad loans under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in the first half of the current year. 
 
 “Our exposure to the first list of   cases (referred by the RBI) is Rs 49,000 crore, against which we have made provisions of 56%. For the second list, it is Rs 28,000 crore and we have made provisions of 75%,” said Kumar. 
 
 Of the first list, the bank expects recovery of 48% of loans and sees a bulk of the resolutions taking place in the first half of FY19. On interest margins, Kumar said that there would be continuous improvement as some large loans moved out of the NPA category to standard assets portfolio. The bank is also rationalising its branches and international offices.
