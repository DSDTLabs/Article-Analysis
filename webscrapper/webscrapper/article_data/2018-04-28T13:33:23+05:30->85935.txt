Surat: Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has written to the Geographical Indication (GI) registry of the Government of India, objecting to GI tag for alphonso mango variety from   region. 

 The alphonso mangoes from Devgad and   have been given GI tags. With this, the total number of GI-tagged products in Maharashtra has risen to 25, the highest in the country.
 
 The BKS office-bearers stated that farmers from   and Valsad districts in south Gujarat have been growing alphonso mangoes for over 200 years and the 20,000 hectares of land is under cultivation of this variety of fruit. A total of 1.40 lakh metric tonne of alphonso mango is being produced every year in Valsad district and it is a major crop for the farmers in the region. 
 
 The coastal area of Valsad has a similar weather as that of Konkan. Valsad district came under the state of Gujarat when it was formed, but geographically it is considered as a part of coastal Sahyadri region along with Konkan coast. 
 
 BKS president S J Patel told TOI, “It is unfair to give the GI tag to alphonso mango from Konkan region. Valsad is the largest producer of alphonso and taste of the fruit is similar to that of Ratnagri and   districts. Every mango grower in Sindhudurg can use the GI tag now. Action can now be taken against those selling mangoes by falsely claiming that they are from Sindhudurg and Devgad. This development will impact mango farmers of Valsad who have been exporting alphonso mangoes.”
