KOLKATA: A fire in the international wing of   triggered the fire alarm, which spread panic among passengers on Thursday evening.

 The electrical fire in the   near a departure gate generated large amount of smoke filling the departure lobby .No one was injured.
 
 Ssources said, around 22 Dhaka-bound passengers waiting in the international departure terminal were alerted by an acrid burning smell. Soon, wisps of smoke were seen escaping from under a door next to departure gate No. 12. Shortly thereafter, the fire alarm began to ring, confirming the suspicion that there was a fire somewhere behind the door.
 
 The door in question led to the UPS room that powered various systems in that section of the airport. “When the airport staff opened the door, thick smoke escaped through it and filled the entire international security hold area. For a while, it reduced visibility and it became difficult for us to breathe,“ a passenger in the terminal said. Some of the people present there panicked and ran helterskelter fearing they would be trapped in a smoke-filled steel and glass building. However, effective handling of the situation by airport staff prevented the situation from escalating into anything dangerous.
 
 While a team tackled the fire with portable fire extinguishers, another evacuated the security hold area. The air-conditioning system of this section was switched off. Boarding via aero-bridges were suspended for a while and shifted to remote boarding gates at the ground level. Consequently , three flight departures were delayed.
 
 “The security hold area was cleared using exhaust fans that are installed to extract smoke from the building. After the smoke was removed, we conducted a thorough check of the security hold area along with all utilities, including the air handling unit. Only then were the ACs switched on,“ airport director   said.
 
 Normal service from the departure security hold area resumed after half 30 minutes.
