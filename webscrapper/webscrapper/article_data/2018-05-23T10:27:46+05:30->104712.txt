Meghan Markle stunned everyone with her appearance in the beautiful wedding gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy. Meghan wore a boat-necked, sculpted white dress for her Royal wedding to Prince Harry. But looks like pop-singer   is not so impressed with Meghan's look.

 On the red carpet of a popular American television show finale, the 'Firework' singer was asked what she thought of Meghan Markle's wedding dress from the royal wedding. To this, she said that she would have done one more fitting to gown. Katy further said that she would never tell the truth but one more fitting would be nice. But she later added that she loves Meghan.
 
 Katy even added that she preferred Kate Middleton's 2011 Alexander   wedding gown over Meghan Markle's.
 
 Katy's comment has sparked a tirade of criticism on Twitter. Fans even went on to say that Katy Perry might not be the most qualified person when it comes to giving out fashion advice.
