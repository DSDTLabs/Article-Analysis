ITANAGAR: Former   chief minister  's widow, Dangwimsai Pul, has sought the apex court's permission for lodging an FIR to investigate the allegations made by her husband in his sensational suicide note. 

 In a written submission to justices J Chelameshwar, Ranjan Gogoi and Madan B Lokur on Monday, Dangwimsai, Pul's first wife, sought their 'sanction for lodging an FIR and investigating the allegations of corruption as contained in the suicide note'.
 
 Saying that it is 'imperative that these allegations contained in this note are credibly and thoroughly investigated by an independent investigating authority', the five-page letter points out that that a probe 'after the registration of an FIR would require the prior sanction of the chief justice/other judges of the  '.
 
 Former chief minister Kalikho Pul had committed suicide on August 9 last year. Pul, a Congress rebel leader, had stepped down from the CM's chair after the Supreme Court ordered removal of his government in July last year. But he had left behind a 60-page note 'Mere Vichar' written by him days before he ended his life. 
 
 Pul's family had earlier appealed to people not to use the issue for vested political interest. The notes, which were found near Pul's body, mentions several 'irregularities' by Arunachal Pradesh leaders and Supreme Court judges over the years. The contents of the note were made public by the media in February this year.
