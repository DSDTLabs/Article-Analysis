KOLKATA: A   train, carrying more than 100 people, got stranded on an   between the   for over one-and-a-half hours as a tree got uprooted and fell on the tracks. The train could not be moved to Noapara, which was barely 20-30m away as broken tree branches had snapped power supply to the third line. Another train got stranded outside Dum Dum .

 While the two motormen of the Dum Dum-Noapara train called for help from the control room, passengers cowered in fear as they watched the storm rage outside. “Fortunately, it was an AC rake or all the debris and dust would have been swept inside. I boarded the train from Chandni Chowk.
 
 
 “I realized a storm was raging only after the train left the underground stretch after Belgachia. Everything was fine till Dum Dum. But around 8.15pm, just before the train entered Noapara, it stopped. As it remained stuck, we called up friends and families who said a tree had fallen on the tracks,” said Bishop, a passenger. Commuters started getting restless as no information reached them about evacuation plan. Panic stricken, some accosted the motorman.
 
 “The motorman said the process was on to evacuate us safely. It was nearly 9.30pm when passengers got off the train in singles from the emergency exit in the motorman’s cabin. My turn came around 9.55pm. We walked along the viaduct for a few minutes to reach Noapara, helped by RPF personnel, holding flashlights,” Bishop said.
 
 According to Metro officials, branches of the tree fell on the Down track between Dum Dum and Noapara at 7.55pm and two trains got stranded. The other got stranded outside Dum Dum station.
 
 “We rushed disaster management teams to both locations. Passengers were brought out as soon as things improved. We also got all trains to platforms. We ran truncated services between Girish Park and Kavi Subhash,”   CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.
