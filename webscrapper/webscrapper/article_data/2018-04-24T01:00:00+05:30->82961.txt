PATNA: The   has asked the Centre and the state government to open a   for girls at Jagdishpur in Bhojpur district as a mark of respect to  , who led the Sepoy Mutiny against the Britishers in 1857.

 “Such an initiative will give a boost to the morale of talented girls of the state, especially in these times when we all are pleading for ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’,” said League’s former vice-president and Bihar Army Officers’ Association coordinator Col (retd) V K Singh.
 
 According to Col (retd) Singh, the erstwhile Shahabad district which now comprises Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur districts, was the soil of warriors like Sher Shah Suri and Veer Kunwar Singh. “Also, soldiers from this district showed their valour in the World War I and II. Two historic battles were also fought in this region — at Chausa and Buxar,” he pointed out.
 
 Lauding the supreme sacrifices of soldiers belonging to the state, Col (retd) Singh said Captain Jyoti Prakash, who hailed from Rohtas, was the first Bihari to be honoured with the highest gallantry award — Ashoka Chakra — posthumously for his sacrifice during a fight with terrorists. 
 
 “Bihar contributes about 11% manpower to the country’s armed forces. About 1.5 lakh soldiers from Bihar are guarding borders of the country, while about 2 lakh ex-servicemen are settled in the state after retirement,” Col (retd) Singh said.
 
 The retired colonel also accused the state government of being laggard in setting up grievance redressal cells for armymen. “The state government had announced that it would set up such a cell in every district under the chairmanship of the respective DM. Only 14 districts have got such cells and that too only on paper,” he said and added grievances of armymen and ex-servicemen were not being addressed in most of the districts as the DMs hardly find time to look into the functioning of these cells.
