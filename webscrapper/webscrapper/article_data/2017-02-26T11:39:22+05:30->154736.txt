AMARAVATI: Assembly speaker   said that Microsoft will most likely set up its office in Amaravati soon. He said that chief minister Chandrababu Naidu is keenly pursuing the project and added that the CM's meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently was also positive. 

 Speaking at a meeting organised by Andhra Chamber of Commerce on 'Amaravati: Present and Future' here on Saturday, Kodela recalled how CM Chandrababu Naidu got the first Microsoft office outside the US to Hyderabad in late 90s.
 
 "In the meeting held in Mumbai recently, Nadella said that two out of the three boards of the company agreed to come to Amaravati. In the late '90s, CM floored Bill Gates, the then CEO, with his presentation and we got the biggest Microsoft office ouside the US. We expect that history will be repeated again," he explained.
 
 He explained that the state government is actively promoting brand Amaravati and that is the reason that investors from across the globe are looking at Andhra Pradesh for investing.
 
 However, speakers at the meeting expressed their disinterest in the greenfield airport proposed in 5,000 acres in Mangalagiri. When former mayor Jandhyala Shankar suggested that an airport be built on Krishna riverbed instead of acquiring 5,000 acres, Kodela said, "I believe that Gannavaram airport is the best one. After the development is complete, I personally feel that there is no need to build on Krishna riverbed or acquire anywhere else for the matter."
 
 Chairman of VCC M Rajaiah also concurred with Kodela and said that there is no need for another airport. "We will do satyagrah if the plans to have another airport were to materialise," he said in a lighter vein.
 
 President of VCC VL Indira Dutt, chartered accountant and economic analyst SRSS Siva Prasad and others participated in the meeting.
