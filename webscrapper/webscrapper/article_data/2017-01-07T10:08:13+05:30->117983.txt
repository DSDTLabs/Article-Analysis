CHANDIGARH: With MS Dhoni stepping down as India’s limited-overs captain and more importantly, Virat Kohli at the helm of affairs, city’s favourite son   in   of things. Yuvraj found a place in   as well as T20 squads for the upcoming series against England. 

 It is yet another comeback for the stylish southpaw, who last played in India colours on March 27, 2016 against Australia at Mohali during the World T20 last year. In fact, Yuvraj has been away from the one-day set-up for even a longer time. His last ODI appearance for India was on December 11, 2013, against South Africa in Centurion.
 
 The ‘comeback’ has arrived on two grounds. One, his brilliant form in domestic cricket — the Punjab batsman created waves in this season’s Ranji Trophy, smashing 672 runs in 5 matches (8 innings) with a highest score of 260. He averaged a whopping 84 and recorded two centuries and two half-centuries during the season. “We should appreciate how Yuvraj has played. He did extremely well in domestic cricket, which has been appreciated,” chief selector MSK Prasad said.
 
 The second reason is his tremendous record against the Englishmen in limited-overs cricket — be it one-dayers or T20.
 
 Who can forget   in an over during the 2007 World Twenty20 in South Africa? It is still fresh in our mind. The Chandigarh lad’s six-hitting feat happened some 10 years back in 2007, but cricketing aficionados talk about it with such fondness as if the incident occurred just a few months back.
 
 The series against England will give Yuvraj a chance to prey on his  .
 
 In 34 ODIs (33 innings) against the Englishmen, Yuvraj has scored 1313 runs at an astounding average of 48.62 and with an even startling strike-rate of 100.76. His exploits against England include 3 centuries and 7 half-centuries, with highest being an unbeaten 138.
 
 In T20Is versus England, Yuvraj’s strike-rate of 229.41 is just mind-boggling. He also averages a healthy 29.25 per innings.
 
 Yuvraj’s love affair with the English bowling attack began in 2002. In his first game itself at Lords, Yuvraj scored an unbeaten 64 and fashioned a 6-wicket win for the Indian team — with Rahul Dravid giving him company in the end.
 
 The most-famous of his knocks against England has to be the 69 he scored in the Natwest Trophy final in 2002. Chasing 326 to win, India were down and out at 146/5 when Yuvraj joined forces with Mohammed Kaif and the pair forged together a match-winning 121-run partnership. India won the final by 2 wickets and the triumph proved to be a huge fillip for Indian cricket.
 
 The other instance where Yuvraj left his indelible stamp over the Englishmen was in 2008. He scored back-to-back centuries (138 not out and 118) in Rajkot and Indore in the first two games of a 7-match ODI series and helped India to a 5-0 series win.
 
 Yuvraj has also been handy with his slow left-arm orthodox. The ‘pie-chucker’ — as former England batsman Kevin Pietersen used to call him — has always struck at crucial junctures and has 18 English wickets to his name in one-day internationals.
