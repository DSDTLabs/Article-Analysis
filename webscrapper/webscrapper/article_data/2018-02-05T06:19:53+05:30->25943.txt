AHMEDABAD: Satish Shah, a   near Ankur Crossroads flinches every time a car blares its horn. His shop is located just in front of an intersection where every   makes a ritualistic ‘U’ turn and honks, which makes him irritable and, according to him, short-tempered. Shah is not alone, as the number of vehicles skyrockets on Ahmedabad roads and over-capacitate them, the   gets worse.

 Recently, students of the civil engineering department of Gujarat Technological University (GTU) in Chandkheda, analysed noise levels in three major junctions of the city — Maninagar railway crossing, Gita Mandir and Sardarnagar, where noise levels exceeded the   (CPCB) levels during late evenings. The highest noise levels was witnessed during night time at Maninagar railway crossing which was higher than its permissible limit by 85.35%. The second highest noise level was witnessed at Sardarnagar because of the airport. The level there was higher than the permissible limit by 71.33%.
 
  
  
 
 “It becomes unbearable, I don’t hear what the customer is saying, there is communication loss, it is irritable and this makes me angry.” By the end of the day, Shah says he hears echoes of horns while in his sleep. Shah is not alone, traffic noise is increasingly becoming a problem for many at busy junctions — the word noise is “nausea”.
