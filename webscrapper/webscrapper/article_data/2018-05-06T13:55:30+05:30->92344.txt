CHENNAI:   students who appeared for   on Sunday said the overall paper was moderate. Many students said while biology and chemistry portions were easy,   portion was tough and they avoided answering some questions to prevent negative marking. 

 "Lot of questions in physics involved complex derivations and we had to use multiple formulae to solve every question," said M Deepak who took up the test at Ramana Vidyalaya School in Sholinganallur.
 
 Most of the questions were based on the CBSE syllabus, and the question paper was tough compared to the previous year's paper, said Mohammed Askar, a student from Theni district who took up the test in Chennai.
 
 Roshni K from Sengakottai said : "The physics portions was tough while biology was easy." Vinay from Vellore also said physics was tough.
 
 Devaraj, a trainer in a private coaching centre, said most of the Chennai students had not answered physics questions to avoid negative marks and some rural students had attempted with the hope that it would boost their scores.
 
 The results are expected on June 5.
