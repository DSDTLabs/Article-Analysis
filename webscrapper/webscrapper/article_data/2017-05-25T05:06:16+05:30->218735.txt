NASHIK: City police commissioner Ravinder   has ordered a probe against nine   police officers for attending the wedding of a relative of underworld don   here on May 19. 

 Highly-placed police sources told TOI on Wednesday that nine police officers and some of their counterparts from Mumbai attended the wedding of the niece of Dawood’s wife and the nephew of a well-known citizen of Nashik. 
 
 The bride’s mother and Dawood’s wife are cousins. “The city commissioner has asked a senior officer to investigate and submit a report within a couple of days,” the source said. The probe will deal only with the nine Nashik police officials, not the Mumbai officials, the officer said. 
 
 Singal confirmed that a probe was on. He refused to comment further. While some officers have already been quizzed, others would be questioned after they return from  , where they have gone on civic polls duty, a source said. “The police officers facing the probe have said they attended the marriage because they know the bridegroom’s uncle, who is a respected member of the society and it was not a criminal act to attend a social event,” said an officer privy to the information.
