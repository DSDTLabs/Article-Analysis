COIMBATORE: The long wait for   Bus Stand ended after rural and municipal administration minister SP Velumani inaugurated it on Saturday.

 The bus stand, which was announced nearly six years ago, was supposed to be constructed as a full-fledged bus stand with parking bays, community hall, rooms and modern amenities. It got delayed due to lack of funds and various other administrative reasons. Land issues forced the   to change the plan, reduce the budget and convert it into an ordinary facility.
 
 As a result, while the initial budget was Rs 5cr, the cost of the project was only Rs 2.5cr, official sources said. Currently, the facility can accommodate only four to five buses at a time.
 
 Vadavalli residents said that the area had grown rapidly. “There was heavy traffic congestion here and the old bus stand was the major reason. Buses stop here for a few hours some times and completely block traffic,” said Bhadrinath, a resident.
 
 Every day, more than 3,000 passengers travel from the place, a commuter said. “Be it sun or rain, commuters suffered due to the lack of a bus terminus. From 7am to 11am and again from 4pm to 9pm, this area is always congested,” said a shop owner near the bus stand.
 
 Though the bus stand has been inaugurated, it is still unclear how the facility will help solve traffic woes as it is not a terminus as planned earlier, said Radha, a resident. “We hope that the civic body expands it soon and ensures that the buses can be parked inside,” she said.
 
 Corporation officials, however, said that it was never meant to be a terminus. “Buses cannot be parked here. They can just enter and exit the facility. It was meant to reduce traffic congestion. It will definitely be useful for commuters as there is a shelter and also seats,” said an engineer.
