BENGALURU: Chief minister  's caste agenda in the run-up to the 2018 assembly polls is all set to be checkmated by the   government. Reason: The Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill 2017 seeks to strip state governments of the power to determine which caste can be declared `socially and economically backward'.

 The bill, currently being reviewed by the Rajya Sabha select committee headed by   MP Bhupender Yadav, seeks to grant constitutional status to the   on Backward Classes ( ). It was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 4 and is likely to be passed in the Upper House in the upcoming   session.
 
 The proposed legislation will be an obstacle for Siddaramaiah, who is banking on the yet-to-be released state caste census to consolidate backward classes' votes and turn the political tide in his favour.In fact, the CM has already announced his government's intention to give 70 per cent reservation in employment for other backward classes.
 
 The bill mooted by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment is expected to upset Siddaramaiah's calculations on two counts: First, it gives exclusive powers to NCBC to examine complaints and requests regarding inclusion or exclusion of groups within the list of backward classes. Second, it makes it mandatory for the state government to consult NCBC on all policy matters concerning socially and economically backward classes (SEBCs).
 
 “If the bill becomes a reality, Siddaramaiah's plan to reposition castes under different categories within backward classes will fail to work.The legislation is a political masterstroke from Modi, given politicians in Karnataka and   have been winning polls by trying to appease backward classes,“ a senior IAS officer told TOI.
 
 The bill has triggered discussions in political corridors, with Siddaramaiah dashing off a letter on Wednesday to select committee chairman Yadav expressing reservations. The CM stated: “The bill seeks to centralize functions relating to safeguarding the interest of SEBCs in the hands of the Union, thus usurping the state's powers.“
