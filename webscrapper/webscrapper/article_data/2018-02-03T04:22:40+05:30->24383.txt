MUMBAI: To give its students a shot at education in schools affiliated to CBSE, CISCE, Cambridge or IB board, the BMC has proposed to set up 35 such institutions through a public-private partnership programme. 

 The schools will be set up in buildings that have shut down either due to lack of students. The corporation is likely to see tie-ups with institutions with a proven record. “The education in these schools will be free of cost and the private partner will have academic control, including the decision to pick the board. It will also hire teachers and pay them,” said Shubhada Gudekar, chairperson of the  . “But administrative control will remain with the BMC.”
 
 BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta said the move was aimed at bringing in outside talent to improve the quality of education in civic schools. “We are putting in a lot of money but the quality of education is still not going up,” he said.
 
 But the plan has not gone down well with a few members. “This could be seen as a step to privatization, hence we have asked BMC to add necessary clauses to secure the interests of needy children. It has been almost two months but we haven’t received the revised draft,” said Sainath Durge, a panel member.
 
 BMC announced that 24 of its schools will be part of the scheme while making an allocation of Rs 25 lakh for it.
 
 In all, BMC has allotted Rs 2,569 crore for education—a Rs 257 crore hike over the last fiscal. For repairs, upgrade and reconstruction of school buildings, Rs 278 crore has been set aside. BMC has also proposed to instal 4,064 CCTV cameras in 381 schools—a long-standing demand from the education committee—and set aside Rs 5 crore for it. In spite of facing flak about the quality of tablets provided to class VIII, IX and X students, the BMC has also allotted Rs 18 crore for their maintenance for the next two years, including towards upgrading the syllabus in the memory cards.
