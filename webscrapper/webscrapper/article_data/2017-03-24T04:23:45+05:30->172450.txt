NEW DELHI: Delhi Police and   have busted a gang of   based in   and rescued two women who were trafficked to Delhi and forced into prostitution by a gang. One of the two women claimed that she was being held captive by the traffickers who had planned to use her to conceive children, whom they would later put up for adoption.

 The two women, however, escaped and reached out to DCW’s Mahila Panchayat counselor for help after which police was contacted. A joint team along with the SDM   conducted a raid at the placement agency and arrested four people, including the owner of the agency.
 
 The women, aged 30 and 40, were from Jharkhand and West Bengal. They were brought to Delhi by two agents of the trafficker gang on the pretext of a job opportunity. In Delhi, the women were kept at a placement agency in Shakurpur during which their mobile phones and Aadhaar cards were taken by the traffickers.
 
 After a few days, the agents dropped them to Arti Placement Agency in Nihal Vihar. The placement agency was run by Arti and her husband Baburaj. The women were beaten by the couple when they refused to conceive children.
 
 Apart from the two women, there were six other women confined to the ‘office’ including a pregnant woman and another woman with a child, who were rescued.
 
 “The two survivors who had approached the commission informed that a few days back, the couple in a hurry to rush a pregnant woman to the hospital forgot to bolt the door,” said a DCW official.
