NOIDA: A power cut forced the newly elected Noida MLA, Pankaj Singh, to use a megaphone to deliver his speech at his first public event after being elected. Singh inaugurated a primary health centre (PHC) at Raipur Khadar village in Sector 126 on Wednesday, which got approval under the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) during the previous regime.

 However, the PHC had to face an outage from 11am and supply could be restored only at 2pm, by which time the event had ended.
 
 Villagers complained that they had been facing more power cuts in the last few days. “Power cuts are a daily issue. However, they have become rampant in the past few days. There is no consistency in power supply,” said Pritam Singh, a resident of Raipur Khadar.
 
 Singh, who is the Union home minister’s son, admitted that supply in Noida was an area the new government needed to work on.
 
 “It’s an industrial hub. There are many BJP-ruled states that get 24-hour electricity supply. If this is the situation here despite being so close to Delhi, then I think it should be rectified and I expect it to be sorted out in the coming days,” he said.
 
 Electricity returned to the venue within 10 minutes of the event ending. The PHC is one of the four heath centres that are supposed to come up in the city under the NUHM. PHCs are funded by both the Centre and state government under the NUHM.
 
 According to Dr Anurag Bhargav, the district CMO, three other PHCs will come up in the city — at Sarfabad in Sector 73, Chhajarsi in Sector 63 and Harola in Sector 5. The centre at Sarfabad will be inaugurated within a week.
