NEW DELHI: Two terror attacks took place in India’s neighbourhood on Monday — in Kabul, the Taliban carried out a suicide bombing killing 29 people, while in Lahore, a powerful bomb blast near the house of chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, killed 22. India condemned the terror attack in Kabul, saying, “The perpetrators and supporters of such heinous acts need to be brought to justice. The safe havens and sanctuaries to terrorists must end.”

 But Delhi was silent about the attack in Pakistan, a rare but significant omission. In a statement, MEA spokesperson said, “India stands in solidarity with the people and the government of Afghanistan …. The continuing terrorist violence in Afghanistan is violation of the basic rights of the people of the country and meant to undermine efforts to build a peaceful, prosperous, stable, united and pluralistic Afghanistan.”
 
 India’s refusal to acknowledge the attack in Lahore or even condole the deaths is rooted in the fact that while terror attacks in Afghanistan are regularly carried out by Pak-sponsored Afghan Taliban, terror attacks in Pakistan are a result of their own policies coming back to bite them. The dead in both cases are ordinary Afghans and Pakistanis.
