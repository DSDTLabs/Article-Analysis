Pranitha Subhash, who was last seen in Mahesh Babu’s Brahmotsavam (2016), is thrilled to return to Tollywood with Hello Guru   starring Ram Pothineni. Touted to be a romantic-comedy, the film directed by Trinadha Rao Nakkina, will see the actress play a simple   girl. “It’s a very relatable girl-next-door character; the sort of girl you would run into at a coffee shop or a movie hall,” she reveals. 
Pranitha says this role will come as a welcome change from the traditional Telugammayi roles that she’s played onscreen so far. “I have always played the homely girl who’s clad in traditional attires which is why I get a lot of saree and jewellery brand endorsements. Even when I meet people, they start talking to me in Telugu, even though I’m a Kannadiga. But my character in Hello Guru Prema Kosame will change that image of mine. You’ll see me as an urban city girl in glamourous clothes. I’ve never played a character like this,” she explains.
 Ask her what took her so long to sign a Telugu film and she says, “I’ve always been like this, very slow, I like to work aaramse. Besides my role, what lured me to take up the film is the chance to work with actors like   and Ram. I have already begun shooting for the film and I’m looking forward to coming to Hyderabad next month for shooting the next schedule,” says the actress, signing off.
