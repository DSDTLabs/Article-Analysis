After years of doing theatre and street plays, when actor   made the transition to the big screen, playing the baddie was not on his agenda. While he was the second lead in his first film,  , his second was stalled and he was on the lookout for a new project when director   approached him for a role in Attempt to Murder. “Amar suggested that I should look at doing villain roles. But I wasn’t too keen. He persisted and told me about the role in Attempt to Murder. The fact that it was a real-life character intrigued me and I thought I should give it a try. Amar had a clear idea about how he wanted the character to be, including my body language, general look, attire, etc. He asked me to grow out a beard and keep my hair rather unkempt, to get a very rugged look. Initially, we thought that I would do it for about three months and start shooting, but eventually, Amar got me to grow out a beard for a year and only then was he happy with the outcome. I did not do any other film in the interim and I think that the effort has paid off,” says Suryaa.
The role, one would imagine, had its own risks, considering that he could get typecast and that audiences would not warm up to him as the character was real-life based, one who had carried out a horrendous attack on a woman at an ATM in Bengaluru. “That is true and I am hoping that audiences will look beyond the character and see Suryaa the artiste. As for getting typecast, well, I cannot be hung up about only doing lead roles if I want a future in films. If the role is good, I will do it, irrespective of its nature. See, for instance, in Attempt to Murder, the beauty of the character is that I hardly have any lines. I communicate with people in the film, and with the audience, only with my expressions. That, I would say, is a performance-oriented role,” Suryaa says.
