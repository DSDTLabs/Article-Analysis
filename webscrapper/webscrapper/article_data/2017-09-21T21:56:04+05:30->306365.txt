Ludhiana: Three days after a theft accused died in the custody at Jodhan police station, station house officer (SHO) Jagjit Singh has been been sent to the police lines.

 On Monday evening, Ashu Kalra, 20, of Mini Chappar in Mandi Ahmedgarh — who was picked up by Jodhan police in a theft case at Chappar Mela — died in police custody under mysterious circumstances. 
 
 Ashu’s relatives and near ones had blamed police for his death. 
 
 Dakha deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Jaswinder Singh Brar said Jagjit Singh was sent to the police lines for an impartial probe into the matter and inspector Lakhbir Singh was posted as SHO of Jodhan police station in his place.
 
 Lakhbir assumed charge of his new posting on Thursday. 
 
 Police sources said there was a lot of pressure on senior police officers in Ludhiana (Rural) district after Ashu’s  , and added that in the near future, some more cops at the police station might be shifted. 
 
 Senior cops were already facing embarassing situation as the findings of autopsy report contradicted their claims. Police had claimed that the youth had died of cardiac arrest, but the autopsy indicated head injuries as the cause of death. 
 
 Meanwhile, a social group ‘Mahatar Sathi Jagriti Manch’ has written to Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC) for its intervention. 
 
 “We have written to PSHRC chairman for action. The autopsy report suggests that Ashu might have died after severe torture. We have also written that this is not the first instance of alleged wrong-doing by cops at Jodhan police station. Earlier, a woman constable was found hanging from the ceiling fan under mysterious circumstances. After every incident, police give the assurance of a proper probe, but do not fulfil their promise. Instead, they try their best to hush up the matter,” said human rights activist Keemti Rawal, who heads the group.
