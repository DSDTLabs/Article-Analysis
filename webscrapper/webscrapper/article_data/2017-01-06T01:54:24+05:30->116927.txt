GHAZIABAD: A piece of land that was to support a boosting station to improve Ganga water supply in Indirapuram is instead being used as a parking lot.

 The   ( ) had pitched the station as a solution to weak water flow from taps in housing societies in   2 but failed to get work started. And it won’t any time soon as elections have been announced and the model code has kicked in. As a result, the problem of weak water supply is likely to continue through the summer months.
 
 The boosting plant was to be built on a GDA plot adjacent to Shanti Gopal Hospital in Ahinsa Khand 2. It will take around nine months to complete. But on the ground, nothing has happened. The vacant plot, in the meantime, is being used as a parking lot for hospital staff and patients, local residents said. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, DK Maurya, president of the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association, said, “It is unfair that despite repeated assurances from the civic authority, there has been no respite for thousands of residents. This matter should have been pursued on priority since it’s a matter of water.”
 
 Maurya, who lives in  , a residential society in Ahimsa Khand 2, said, “It is extremely saddening to see that a plot of land where a   has been promised is still being used as a parking area.” Asked about the delay, a senior GDA official said, “We are aware of this problem and we were waiting to receive clearances from the land acquisition department. However, the project will take more time for implementation due to upcoming state elections. Estimates, tenders and approvals will all happen after the polls.”
 
 Asked why the hospital was using GDA land for parking,  , director, Shanti Gopal Hospital, said, “The land belongs to GDA and is being temporarily used as a parking area by the hospital.”
