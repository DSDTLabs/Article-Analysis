NEW DELHI: Both Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and Delhi Congress slammed   on Tuesday for experimenting with the master plan, leading to chaos in the city.

 AAP’s Dilip Pandey said the   ruling restraining amendments to the master plan has left BJP exposed. “To make the traders believe that it was concerned about them, BJP claimed it could find a solution to the   problem by amending the master plan. But now the drama of BJP has been exposed,” said Pandey.
 
 AAP, he added, has already said that while waiving off conversion charges can bring some relief to traders, a permanent solution can come only if the BJP-led central government introduces an ordinance.
 
 Alleging that BJP does not want to help traders, Pandey said, “BJP was doing politics on the issue by blaming the AAP government for sealing. Since the civic bodies and the central government are run by BJP, it should find out a solution and stop blaming us.” 
 
 However, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari slammed CM   and his government for being a mute spectator. “It is sad that the Delhi government was sitting like a mute spectator and did not raise the cause of the traders of Delhi in the Supreme Court,” he said. “We will pursue the matter in the Supreme Court to ensure relief for the traders.” 
 
 Delhi Congress president   pointed out that there was no need to amend the master plan. “In 2012 and 2013, we had amended the master plan to resolve the issues of FAR and basement use.”
 
 DDA’s attempt to bring in a new policy within the master plan has only harmed traders, Maken added. “Both Delhi government and the Centre have done nothing for the traders except creating chaos across the city. Had the civic bodies, governments and DDA had submitted the affidavits before the court, today’s order could have been avoided,” he said.
