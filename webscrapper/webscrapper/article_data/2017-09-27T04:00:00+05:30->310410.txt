Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh launched the automatic milk collection system (AMCS) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). AMCS is an integrated software to ensure transparency and meet the entire operational requirements at the district cooperative society level. This software links various stakeholders at the union, federation and the national level. The integrated structure also has a collective provision of financial inclusion and mobile application for key informatics. During the same function, Parshottam Rupala launched INDUSCHIP, a medium-density genotyping chip for major Indian cattle breeds and their crosses for genomic selection. NDDB is the first in the country to develop this type of custom made chip. It will help semen stations select bulls at the young age without waiting for their daughtersâ€™ production records and farmers select their heifers for replacement even at birth. Using this chip breed purity of major Indian cattle breeds and proportion of various breeds in cross-breeds can also be checked.
