MANGALURU: Chief minister   has agreed to formulate a separate sand mining policy for the   of the state. 

 The CM agreed to implement such a policy soon in response to a demand to this effect placed before him by a delegation of leaders from Dakshina Kannada district led by minister for forest   that met him in Bengaluru on Monday, a release said. 
 
 During the meeting, Rai told Siddaramaiah that the coast has been facing serious problems on account of sand mining and its supply. The administration is facing pressure from the common man and other stakeholders in this regard, he said while drawing CMâ€™s attention towards differences prevalent in sand mining practised in the coast and other parts of Karnataka. 
 
 Rai said the only permanent solution to the problem is to formulate a separate sand mining policy for the state and end the confusions therein.
 
 Siddaramaiah who agreed with this view point averred that people should not face problems in obtaining sand on account of procedural and policy issues. The state government too is committed to ensuring that everyone has a roof over their heads under its housing policy and has taken up construction of dwelling units in large numbers. The government will formulate a separate sand mining policy after taking in to account views of all stakeholders, Siddaramaiah reportedly told the delegation.
 
 The delegation also urged the CM to give greater thrust to Paschimavahini project for the district that faces perennial problem of drinking water shortage every summer. Rai urged the CM to ensure adequate budgetary allocation for the project in the state budget. 
 
 The delegation urged the CM to provide relaxation in norms to sink borewells in Puttur taluk given that the taluk is facing drinking water problem. Rai said the CM promised to consider the request positively.
