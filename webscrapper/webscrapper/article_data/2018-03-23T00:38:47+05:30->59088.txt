Abohar: A delegation of Punjab MPs led by Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar called on the Union communication minister Manoj Sinha and asked him to ensure communication facilities to the pilgrims during the Amarnath Yatra.

 On this occasion, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, were also present with him. Jakhar said the Amarnath Langar Seva Samiti, having its branches in Uttar Pradesh and other states, had been offering free halt and food facilities by erecting tents at Pissu Top point on Pahalgam-Chandanbari route during Amarnath Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir for the past two decades. However, due to the lack of communication facilities in the Pissu Top area, devotees and administrators are unable to connect contact their families.
 
 He said the BSNL had, a few years ago, provided a temporary PCO and mobile tower at Pissu Top and the facility was highly appreciated by pilgrims, social activist and government employees. He urged the temporary PCO and mobile tower be installed at that point.
 
 The Union minister assured that adequate arrangements would be made by the government to provide communication facilities to the pilgrims.
