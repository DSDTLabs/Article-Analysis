MUMBAI: Incarcerated artist   on Friday moved the trial court with a plea to drop the twin murder case against him. His application for discharge comes on the heels of him having moved the Bombay high court for a stay on the trial court proceedings and to have an independent fair probe by a high ranking   officer. 

 The   who is hearing arguments for framing charges against the artist and four others for the December 2015 murder of his artist wife Hema and her lawyer Haresh Bhambhani scheduled to hear his discharge plea on August 21. 
 
 The artist had been in custody since December 2015. His plea comes as one more defence arsenal he is using as his "shot at justice". 
 
 In his discharge plea, which if accepted would result in the case being dropped against him, he has cited the CD-R record. He said the record reflects that "Hema had long conversations with her Lawyer late nights."
 
 "The CDR record shows that he was not in contact with any of the accused except Vidyadhar(absconding accused) and that too for a couple of times for a very short duration in the month of December, 2015."
 
 But, his plea is that Vidyadhar was known to both him and Hema. Vidyadhar was their art fabricator.
 
 Chintan explained that he was in touch with Vidyadhar as an appeal filed by Hema against divorce granted to him by the family court was pending in the Bombay HC and his lawyer had asked him to collect information with respect of Hema’s property for submission in the high court.
 
 Chintan's application said "Vidyadhar had furnished him photographs of Hema’s property to him and probably of his father's house in Jaipur to her,thus getting pecuniary benefits from both warring spouses."
 
 He said with "not enough material" against him and while a roving enquiry cannot be done while framing charges neither can the court merely and blindly accept "absurd" submissions made by the prosecution to try him for murder.
