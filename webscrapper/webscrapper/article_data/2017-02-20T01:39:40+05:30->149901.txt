Lucknow: Only 25 persons out of 1,000 cast vote in Virayanpur village under   constituency on Sunday to drive home their demand for a pucca bridge. “More than five, including two children were grievously injured moving on the wooden   that we build ourselves every year after the previous flows away in the floods and while we have been demanding for a strong bridge for ages and no one has paid heed,”said Siyaram, a villager. 

 A new bridge could cut short distance to the nearest town by 16km. Absence of a proper bridge has also taken its toll on fate of village girls, baraat for several of whom returned failing to cross over and led to the marriages getting called off.
 
 Residents complained that in last assembly elections, Samajwadi Party sitting MLA Indal Kumar promised to fulfil their demand but the bridge was not constructed even after his victory. 
 
 Among the handful who voted was 99-year old, Nafees Jahan, who has never missed voting in any election all her life. On what made her vote, her one-word answer was, “Mulayam”.
