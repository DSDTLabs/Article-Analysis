GUWAHATI: In a statement that could give a religious twist to crime against women, a senior BJP MP here on Friday said people from a particular community are involved in most of the rape cases in  . 

  Bijoya Chakraborty, who represents Gauhati in the   and is a former Union minister, said incidents of rape have risen manifold in the state over the last few years. She added, "Not a single day passes without reports of rape. Even minors are not spared. We are seeing this trend in Assam too and majority of the people involved in rape are from a particular community." She further said, "It seems raping a woman has become a kind of birthright." 
 
 Supporting capital punishment for rapists, Chakraborty said, "If they are not hanged or shot, they will resume their crime after remaining in jail for a few months."
 
 On Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stand that no one should politicize incidents of rape, Chakraborty, who served as BJP's national vice-president until 2014, said, "I am not politicizing crime against women. I am simply highlighting the truth. I want to say that rapists are perverts and may belong to any community." She added, "We need some stringent laws that can deter people from committing rape."
