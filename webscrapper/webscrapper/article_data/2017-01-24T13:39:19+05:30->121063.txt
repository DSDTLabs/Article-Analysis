Sandalwood's stakeholders are shaken by the second tragedy at a film shooting site in just two months. Two actors had drowned in T G Halli reservoir while shooting for a film in November last year; on Monday, a junior artiste was found dead at a construction site where a film was being shot.
L  , veteran actor and president of Kannada Film Workers, Artistes and Technicians Federation (KFWATF), told TOI they will soon sit with officials from the  , and chalk out solutions.
 
 'Even before we could forget the TG tragedy, another death occurred at a film shooting location. Production unit managers and others who carry out directions of the producer and director are scared to work as they fear being arrested in case of any mishaps.It is time we solve this issue once for all,' he said. According to Ashok, junior artistes like   -who was found dead at the shooting location don't belong to any association or federation.
 
 'In KFWATF, we have 22 associations such as Stunt Masters' Association, Dancers' Association and so on. Unfortunately, there is no association or federation to fight for or safeguard the interest of junior artistes like Padmamma. They are hired by some agents,' he said.
 
 'The agents must ensure the safety of these workers by having a talk with the producer, who is the principal employer,' he said.
 
 TIMES VIEW
 
 The death of junior artiste Padmamma, just two months after the horrific drownings in TG Halli during another film shooting, lays bare the lack of safety measures during shoots. This is especially true for the secondary members of the film. While no one is sure whether the artiste was pushed to death, fell accidentally or jumped to death, the producer and director should take responsibility. Producers are willing to pay top actors a fat fee, but cut corners on essentials like the safety and security of junior artistes. It's high time this changed.
