No land acquisition is required for Kochi Metro from mobility hub to Kunnara Park, but the need for widening the road on this stretch was ignored. Hence, this portion of Vyttila-Pettah road would remain narrow.
 
 “From the mobility hub the metro passes over a bridge, and further moves through the viaduct constructed on the pillars installed inside the park. Measures should be put in place to widen the road on this stretch as well as to maintain the park,“ said committee member and Kochi corporation councillor VP Chandran.
