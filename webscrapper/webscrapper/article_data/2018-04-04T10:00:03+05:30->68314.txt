MADURAI: A petition has been filed at the Madras high court Madurai bench seeking direction to the Madurai city police commissioner to register an FIR against actor   in a paternity case. 

 It is expected that the plea would come up for hearing on Wednesday. R Kathiresan from   has filed the petition. 
 
 The petitioner said that he had already filed a plea before the judicial magistrate court in Melur in Madurai seeking maintenance from the actor by claiming that he is his son. Against it, the actor filed a case before the high court bench.
 
 A single judge, who heard the case passed an order on April 21 last year quashing the petitioner’s plea before the magistrate court by declaring that he had not made out a prima facie case for trial and his petition was devoid of merits.
 
 The bench quashed the petitioner’s plea based on the documents - birth certificate and school transfer certificate, produced by the actor before the high court. Actually, the actor had forged the documents and submitted the same before the high court to defeat the ends of justice. 
 
 The birth certificate produced by the actor was not found in the   birth register. Hence, the petitioner lodged a complaint before the K Pudur police in Madurai on October 5 last year. As there was no action, he gave a representation to the Madurai city police commissioner on October 23 seeking to register an FIR against the actor. But, the police has not chosen to do it so far.
 
 Hence, it was necessary to direct the police to register the FIR, the petitioner said.
