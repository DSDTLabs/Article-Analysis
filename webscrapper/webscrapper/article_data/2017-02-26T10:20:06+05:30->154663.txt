NASHIK: For all the students and parents who are worried about the higher school certificate exam, can now talk to the   of the Maharashtra State Board’s  .

 In the last few years, the number of suicides among students has shot up. Looking out for the students, the Board has set up a helpline with professional counsellors to guide and help them and their parents during the examination. 
 
 The main aim of the counsellors will be to answer the caller’s queries and help them feel relaxed with the examination related stress. 
 
 For Nashik, the students can call Bawa Kiran Ramgir on 9423184141, who will be available between 10am and 8pm, daily. Any confusion regarding the examination or psychological pressure or depression can be discussed.
 
 A counsellor, Manish Patil said, “The counselling proved beneficial for many students last year, when I received more than 800 calls and it was a good experience. This year, due to more awareness, I am getting at least 10 calls a day even though the examination is yet to begin.”
 
 The frequently asked questions by students and parents, alike are “Will the papers be easy this time?’ and ‘How to Remember Answers?’. Patil said, “Parents usually call to ask about hall tickets, exam centres and complain about kids not being serious about their exam preparations.”
