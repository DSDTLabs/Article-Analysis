 V never gets tired of playing the bad guy. He is popular for his villainous role in the Kamal Haasan-starrer Papanasam. He will be next seen in   Raguram’s Yaathumaagi Nindrai. 

 Talking about his role, he says, “I play a negative character, an owner of an ad agency and a model co-coordinator, who has come down to India from abroad. I am just a bad person who does wrong to everyone. The movie revolves around the struggles of the junior dancers of the film industry. When Gayathri came up with the movie, I readily agreed as the script was interesting. Also, she is an old friend of mine,” says Abishek, adding, “From Rajinikanth to   they have done their share of villain roles. I like being the baddie as it gives me more scope to act. How long will you be the good guy, dance around trees and look at the heroine? I’d rather show my anger and my muscular physique.” (laughs). 
 
 Abi is also doing a film with lyricist Pa Vijay. The movie called Arudra has Pa   directing and acting in it
