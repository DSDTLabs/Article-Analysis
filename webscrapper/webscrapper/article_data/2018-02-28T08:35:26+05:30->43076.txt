KOCHI: The high court has registered a case suo motu regarding the lynching of tribal youth Madhu at Attappadi.

 The court’s action follows a letter written by Justice  , who is in charge of   (KELSA), to the  , seeking the court’s intervention. In the letter, the judge said it is shameful that such an incident has occurred in a civilized society.
 
 
 Based on the letter, the Chief Justice has directed for registering a suo motu   (PIL) regarding the lynching.
 
 Lynching of the youth for allegedly stealing small amounts of rice and other food items is an example of the moral lapse that has occurred in the society. It brought shame to Malayalis who take pride that Kerala is a complete literate state. It is essential that the court should interfere and direct for remedial measures, the letter said.
 
 It also said many welfare measures are being implemented in tribal areas through various government agencies. Poverty alleviation programmes are being conducted in these regions with the help of other charitable organizations too. If Madhu had to steal food despite the existence of such initiatives, it shows that the welfare measures of the government aren’t effective. Changes should be made to the welfare schemes for the tribals until the benefits reach them, the judge exhorted in the letter.
 
 The lynching also shows how tribals are being viewed by others, the judge pointed out. According to a report, Madhu used to work before but had to leave the job due to fear of other co-workers. Steps are needed to ensure that such attacks against tribals are prevented, the judge demanded.
 
 Further, the judge said in the letter that the seriousness of the crime committed against Madhu is much higher if he was a person who was mentally unstable. The incident that saw a mob taking law into their hands should be viewed very seriously. Effective action is required to ensure that similar incidents do not repeat, including proper investigation and prosecution, the letter said.
