AHMEDABAD: The   on Monday ruled that medical graduates from the only deemed university of Gujarat,   in Vadodara, are eligible for admission in postgraduate medical courses under the state quota.

 The pass-outs from Sumandeep Vidhyapith had moved the high court for direction to the state government to accept their applications for admission in PG medical courses under the 50% state quota. They argued that the state government’s stand and rules that deny them admission under the state quota and holding them eligible for only All India Quota after clearing NEET-PG is improper. They also contended that in various states, students from deemed universities are eligible for admission under the state quota because the deemed universities are situated in the respective states.
 
 The state government had opposed the demand and submitted before the high court that it was empowered to make such rules and said that the   had approved its decision.
 
 The high court rejected the state government’s argument and held that the students of the deemed university situated were eligible for admission under the state quota. “Merely because the director general of health services is empowered for the counselling of the seats available in deemed universities, the same is no ground to exclude the graduates, who have graduated from deemed universities in the state for the purpose of eligibility for admissions to postgraduate medical courses in the state,” the high court said.
