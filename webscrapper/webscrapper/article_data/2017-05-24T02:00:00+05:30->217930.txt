PATNA: At least 32,000 government staff members, including 10,000 policemen and women, will be on duty to manage the urban body election in Patna district on June 4 and 7.

 At least 2,000 of the election workforce will be duly designated magistrate-rank officers, Patna DM   said while inspecting the sealing of EVMs at the Bankipore Girls’ High School on Tuesday. The sealing work will continue for four days amid tight security.
 
 The voting will be held at 1,975 polling booths, including 1,515 meant for the   (PMC)’s 75 wards. In view of the scorching heat, the DM said, the administration will make arrangements for sufficient drinking water and shades at polling booths.
 
 The polling for electing ward councillors of the PMC is scheduled for June 4. The votes for seven other municipal councils and Maner nagar panchayat in Patna district will be cast on June 7.
 
 Seats of 289 wards are up for grabs in these elections in the district. The 75 PMC seats include those of three new wards — 22A, 22B, 22C — carved out of Pataliputra, Mainpura, Gosain Tola and the areas which were earlier part of Digha panchayat. 
 
 The votes cast during the two phases will be counted on June 10. The results are likely to be declared the same day.
