Bengaluru: A 33-year-old man was found murdered and his body was recovered from his car at Kondalli near Magadi town, Ramanagara district, on Tuesday.

 Puttaraju was a resident of Ramenahalli and traded in plaster of paris (POP). He had an office in Bengaluru. “Puttaraju received a call from his friends inviting him for a party on Monday night and went to meet them. He went missing after that and his family members were unable to reach him as his mobile remained switched off,” police said. 
 
 The murder came to light after Puttaraju’s brother Lingaraju received a call. The caller told him they had killed Puttaraju and the family could find his body in his car, a Maruti Swift, near Kondalli. Lingaraju rushed to the spot and found his brother’s body on the rear seat of the vehicle. 
 
 Puttaraju’s family suspects he may have been killed by two of his friends, with whom he had frequent fights. Magadi police are making efforts to track down the killers.
