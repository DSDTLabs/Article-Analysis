This man can make you laugh and cry at the drop of a hat, but deep within, despite being a well-known   actor,   essentially remains a simple-hearted soul, who loves his wife abundantly. Not many know, but   back in those years used to work with a leading news channel, and Siddarth, who was back then a struggling actor, used to stalk her in a local train.

 Rekindling their romance of a local train yet again, Siddarth took the same local train in order to surprise wife Trupti, reminiscing those days. Siddarth and his wife Trupti are all set to take the challenge on a couple's dance show. Overwhelmed by her husband’s efforts, Trupti said, “I was traveling by the train like I always do. Siddarth is very famous but I am not. But I was shocked and surprised to see Siddarth boarding the same train as mine and showering me with the same love and flowers.”
 
 Says Siddharth, "Trupti has been my support system, my companion and my true love since more than a decade now. I'm looking forward to dancing with her on the show. It’s not about knowing how to dance but learning dance together and spending some time with each other amidst our busy schedules. I wish to start this journey with our romance again and what better way to surprise her in a same train I once used to stalk her.”
