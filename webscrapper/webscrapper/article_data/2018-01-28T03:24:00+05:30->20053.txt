Nagpur: An 18-year-old Std XI student has been arrested for stealing 16 tola gold and some silverware from his maternal uncle’s residence at Yogeshwar Nagar. A team of Nandanvan police has recovered the stolen valuables and also nabbed a 16-year-old teenager for his involvement in the crime.  The accused, identified as Sannidhya Somkuwar, broke into the residence of his uncle Vivek Devgade, an electrical contractor, on January 20. Somkuwar, who was nabbed earlier too for a cycle theft, is addicted to liquor.  Police said Somkuwar knew where the valuables were kept at Devgade’s home. Some of Devgade’s neighbours had spotted Somkuwar leaving his uncle’s house after the theft. Despite this information, Devgade and Somkuwar’s mother were preventing cops from taking action against him until the stolen gold was recovered.  The gold was recovered from an almirah at Somkuwar’s residence by API Pankaj Ghadge, PSI Snehlata Jaybhaye, head constable Ramesh Chikhle, Shrikant Sable, Deepak Belsare and Ajay Marode under supervision of PI Manik Nalawade of MIDC police station.  Police have also seized Somkuwar’s bike which his mother had purchased on loan so that he could attend college. However, Somkuwar used the bike for criminal activities, said cops. It is learnt, Somkuwar had planned to sell off the gold to earn some quick cash and offered the 16-year-old teenager Rs10,000 to assist him.
