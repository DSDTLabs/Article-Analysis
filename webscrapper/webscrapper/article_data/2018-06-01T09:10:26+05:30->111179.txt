LUDHIANA: In a breather for city exporters who had been raising concern over delay in processing of their GST refunds, the Customs Commissionerate Ludhiana — under orders of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) — started the   refund camp on Thursday, which will continue until 14 June for disposing of pendency of IGST (Integrated Goods and Servies Tax) refund claims.

 Giving more information about the same, Comissioner of Customs Arvinder Singh Ranga said: “Exporters and trade associations have represented for seeking a resolution of problems that have hindered sanction of refund of IGST paid to them. In order to solve this issue, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is observing the second IGST refund fortnight from 31 May to 14 June, in which pending IGST refund claims will be disposed of.”
 
 Ranga also added: “There had been technical flaws for filing of IGST refunds, like exporters had inadvertently mis-declared IGST paid on export supplies, as IGST paid on interstate domestic outward supplies while filing GSTR-3B etc. During the special drive, exporters would be guided to resolve various inadvertent mistakes through e-mails, telephones, and meetings at ports. Accordingly, senior officers have been appointed as nodal officers for the said purpose.”
 
 The commissioner also informed that for clearance of pending IGST refunds, all IGST refund claimants may register on Icegate website, if not already done, to check their refund status, and he also requested exporters to come forward and avail of the opportunity to get refunds sanctioned during this special drive.
