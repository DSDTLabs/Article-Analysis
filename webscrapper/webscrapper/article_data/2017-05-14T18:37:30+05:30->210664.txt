PANAJI: With concern regarding the growing rate of road accidents in the state, minister for transport Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that his department will facilitate necessary arrangements for KTC drivers to be screened for sleep  .

 Speaking at the inauguration of the state's first-of-its-kind 'sleep and breathing center' at Manipal Hospital, Sudin affirmed that snoring, which is one of the main symptoms of the disorder, is prevalent among drivers.
 
 “We will arrange cabs for   (KTC) drivers. They will be taken for the screening as well as awareness. We will provide whatever support we can give from the government's side," Dhavalikar said, adding that they will also consider subsidizing the treatment by bringing it under the ambit of Deen Dayal healthcare scheme.
 
 Explaining the need to provide a dedicated diagnosis system for the disorder, pulmonologist Dr Prabhu Prasad said that the disorder accounts for 20-30% of road accidents worldwide.
 
 “Sleep Apnea is the disorder where the patient finds it difficult to breath while sleeping. The lack of oxygen can lead to multiple issues, including heart attacks. Drivers suffering from the disorder tend to fall drowsy while on the wheels, which causes accidents,” he explained.
 
 The cost of treatment may rise to Rs 80,000. The hospital has also opened up the option of renting the CPAP machines used to assist in breathing while sleeping.
 
 The sleep and breathing centre will also address other ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.
