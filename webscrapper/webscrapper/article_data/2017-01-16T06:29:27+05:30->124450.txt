JAIPUR: The Rajasthan government on Sunday informed Gujjar leaders that it had moved a   (SLP) in the  . It is slated for hearing on January 23 or 28 and the government would formulate its response based on the apex courtâ€™s decision. Gujjar leaders and the ministerial committee have decided to meet again on February 15.

 Gujjar leaders have been holding talks with the ministerial committee constituted by the government in the aftermath of the   striking down their SBC quota of 5% on the ground of violating constitutional cap of 50% set by the apex court.
 
 Himmat Singh, spokesman for the  , said, the Gujjars had objected to the re-survey being conducted by the high-power committee under Justice (retired) S K Garg for the five castes, which formerly came under SBC, and demanded that if such a survey was being conducted it should cover all the 81 castes in OBC. This survey could come in handy later as the high court had found the earlier   prepared by Justice (retired) I S Israni flawed.
 
 Gujjars have also objected to the exclusion of SBC candidates selected for appointment before the court order came on December 9. 
 
 The Gujjar leaders have also sought the data of appointment of SBC candidates from October 16, 2015, when the Special Backward Classes Reservation Act came into force, till December 9, 2016, when the high court nullified the act, so that the actual number of beneficiaries could be found out. The government agreed to provide them the data in two days. 
 
 Gujjars are now demanding a separate quota within OBC so that reservation will not exceed the 50% limit. The government is jittery as it may antagonize the Jats whose inclusion in OBC triggered the Gujjar agitation for separate quota.
