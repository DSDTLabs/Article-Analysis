Karur: PMK youth wing leader   has stressed on the need for declaring the Cauvery delta region as a protected agriculture zone to safeguard lakhs of wetlands across the districts, including Trichy, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Cuddalore. 

 Ramadoss addressed a public meeting at Karur on Saturday as part of the party’s ‘Save Cauvery Mission’ campaign, which began at Biligundulu on Friday. The party intends to raise awareness on the importance of the Cauvery river as the lifeline of the state as well as affiliated issues of farm livelihoods and ecology on the Cauvery delta.
 
 Earlier speaking to reporters, he said that 50% of the 68 sand quarries established in Tamil Nadu function on the Cauvery riverbed. Sand quarrying has caused depletion of groundwater table in the state, he alleged. 
 
 ‘While the total requirement of sand for Tamil Nadu is 30,000 loads per day, the total quantity quarried is 90,000 loads. The excess sand is being transported to our neighboring states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Karur district is infamous for illegal sand mining. Earlier DMK’s former MP KC Palanisamy and former minister V Senthil Balaji had been executing the operation, and now the present transport minister MR Vijayabaskar has started to look after that,” he alleged.
 
 Ramadoss said that a 40-foot dam should be constructed across the Cauvery between Karur and Trichy to store 5 to 7 tmc water, which otherwise flows out into the sea. “The average rainfall received in Tamil Nadu is 945 mm for 34 days a year. The entire state has to use the available water for the remaining 11 months. However, this year there is neither water nor sand present in the Cauvery,” he said, adding, “Cauvery Management Board is the only way to solve this.”tNN
