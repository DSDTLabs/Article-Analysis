KOLHAPUR: The Maharashtra State Transport Corporation’s (MSRTC) Kolhapur division is recording losses in its   non-stop bus service launched four years ago.

  The percentage of passengers is just 56% on an average, the MSRTC needs to get a minimum of 82% passengers to make profit.
 
 Altogether 40 non-stop MSRTC buses ply on the Kolhapur-Pune route. The corporation started the bus service in 2013 and though the bus saves on commute time, the MSRTC is finding it hard to keep up as it is incurring losses.
 
 According to the MSRTC norms, the buses should have a minimum of 82% passengers to earn profits. However, the percentage of passengers for the Kolhapur-Pune bus route has remained 56% since it was started.
 
 Divisional controller of Kolhapur MSRTC   said, “Bus services are essential for the public. The non-stop bus service helps reduce their time considerably. It also helps attract new passengers. As per our norms, buses should be fill up to 82% to earn profits. It is true that a percentage of this has been around 56% since its start. In the festive season like Diwali and Ganeshotsav, the percentage goes up to 65%. There are many other routes that are above the slab of profit. We therefore club the earnings together to recover losses.”
 
 Transport expert   said, “The frequency of the buses can be improved if they are allowed more halts to increase passenger flow. Kolhapur buses should enter Satara for more passengers. The number of buses could be curtailed to save buses and diesel.”
 
 Central Bus Stand in-charge   said, “We have a hard task trying to retain passengers with state transport as we have to provide services in a given time. We can’t behave like private operators. Therefore, we don’t have any other option than to run the service.”
