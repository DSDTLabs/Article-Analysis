Pimpri Chinchwad: Campaigning heavily and securing 32 seats for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bhosari assembly constituency couldn’t ensure MLA Mahesh Landge’s brother Sachin a winning position in the area.

 However, former Bhosari MLA Vilas Lande’s son was successfully elected from the constituency.
 
 There are a total of 42 seats in Bhosari assembly constituency represented by Mahesh Landge. He fielded his brother Sachin from ward munber 5 (Gawlinagar-Savantnagar) and campaigned intensely but could not help him bag the seat. Sachin was defeated by NCP’s sitting corporator Ajit Gavhane by a margin of 336 votes.
 
 Vilas Lande had fielded his son Vikrant from ward number 8 (Indrayaninagar-Kendriyavihar). Lande defeated his rival Tushar Sahana of Shiv Sena by 397 votes.
