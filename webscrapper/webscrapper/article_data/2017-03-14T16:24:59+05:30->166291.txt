MANGALURU: Even as the Congress in Karnataka is busy preparing strategy for Nanjangud and  , KPCC former president   predicts party’s defeat because of chief minister  . 

 Poojary has said that Congress will lose Nanjangud and Gundlupet constituencies in the bypoll if Siddaramaiah continues as chief minister of the state. The veteran Congress leader also urged the   to immediately replace Siddaramaiah with G Parameshwara as the chief minister for the remaining tenure. 
 
 "Congress will lose both Nanjangud and Gundlupet seats because of Siddaramaiah, who has arrogance. He has already enjoyed the power as chief minister of Karnataka for more than three years. Now let high command take a decision to replace him with G Parameshwara, who is dalit leader. Congress can bag Nanjangud and Gundlupet only if the party high command replaces Siddaramaiah with Parameshwara," Poojary said. 
 
 He said it is because of Siddaramaiah’s arrogance the party has lost S M Krishna too. "S M Krishna is a powerful leader, who has vast experience in politics as chief minister, governor and Union minister. Krishna would not have left Congress if Siddaramaiah had given him due respect and sought his suggestions in political matters. He has left the party only because of Siddaramaiah’s arrogance," Poojary said and reiterated that replacing Siddaramaiah with G Parameshwara is the only solution to save Congress and also ensure party’s victory in Nanjangud and Gundlupet constituencies. 
 
 While bye-elections for Nanjangud and Gundlupet are set to be held on April 9, March 21 is the last date for nomination and counting will be on April 13.
