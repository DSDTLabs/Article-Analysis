Whenever music director   composes for a   film, the soundtrack almost always makes the right noise. After working together on seven films —  , Victory, Adhyaksha,  ,  , Jai Maruthi 800 and   — and with two more in the pipeline, they are considered a hit combination and share an undeniable chemistry, which both of them vouch works best for their collaborations. Like all their other collaborations, this week’s release, Raj Vishnu, has Arjun excited. “When I worked with Sharan on Rambo, he did not have any particular image as a hero that audiences would expect me to cater to. That gave me a certain freedom to experiment, yet at the same time, I had to make sure that my music sets a trends for his kind of films. Today, when you think of songs from Sharan’s films, there are certain expectations and audiences look forward to music that appeals to all, especially children,” says Arjun.
Such is their comfort level that the composer has figured out the exact flavour of music to work on for Sharan, without sounding repetitive. “Sharan has blind faith in me. Even though he has the freedom to provide creative suggestions before composing, he never does. Instead, he waits for me to finish and then says whether it is good or bad. In that sense, he is quite the critic and doesn’t mince words in conveying his reaction to a song. That, I guess, is the secret behind our winning combination,” says Arjun, who has composed for the actor’s   and will work on   as well.
