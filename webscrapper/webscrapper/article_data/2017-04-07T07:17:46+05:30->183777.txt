LUCKNOW: With hope that the new government will reverse the   of the state's milk brand Parag, officials of the dairy federation will be meeting   Yogi Adityanath on Friday and bring to his notice their problems. 

 The officials will highlight how there was no protection of the state-owned brand from other players in the market. Unlike Bihar, where no other milk brand is allowed in the market apart from the state-owned Sudha, or Amul in Gujarat,   government in the past five years allowed six private sector dairy companies to encroach up on the market of the state-owned dairy which has existed since the British period and is older than Amul. 
 
 "Ironically, given the poor quality of milk in Gujarat, Amul buys it from the dairy farmers and after processing it sells it to UP," said a senior official of Parag, requesting not to be named. Parag's milk sale has come down in the last five years from 4 lakh litres to just 2 lakh litres per day.
