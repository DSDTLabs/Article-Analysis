Those of you who were floored by Sujoy Ghosh’s tense, short thriller  , can prepare for another treat as the director gears up to shoot his second short film. Based on Satyajit Ray’s story Anukul, Sujoy’s film has pulled off a casting coup.   Chatterjee and   U Sengupta — the actors who play the detective Byomkesh Bakshi from two production houses — are set to star in this one.
 Anukul tells a story of a master and his humanoid robot, who is in many ways a companion to him. Sujoy will shoot the film in Kolkata from the first week of April. 
  
  
 The director’s Ahalya, which made a big splash online in 2015, was based on the mythological story of Ahalya from the Ramayana and starred Soumitra Chatterjee, Radhika Apte and Tota Roychoudhury. Parts of it seemed to take off from another of Ray’s stories, Professor Sonku O Ashchorjo Putul.
 After Abir and Jisshu were snapped up to play Byomkesh by two production houses, the two of them have not been seen together in any film, though there have been many offers. The notable exception was Rajkahini, which had both of them as part of an ensemble cast.
 When Sujoy, who is a friend to both, approached the actors for the short film, they didn’t think twice before giving their nod. Says a source close to the unit, “Sujoy always wanted to work with Jisshu and Abir and has been in talks with them for a couple of months. The short film has meaty roles for both and the casting was no hurdle. He also procured rights to Anukul from Sandip Ray and is now working out the logistics of the shoot.”
  
  
 A lot has been written in recent times about the rivalry between Abir and Jisshu. While there is certainly a healthy competition between them, if there was any distance, that seems to have been bridged. Abir was recently seen at the promotions of Jisshu’s next release. Here’s hoping that working with Sujoy will bring two of our biggest heroes even closer.
