Rajkot: The general board meeting of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) on Thursday became stormy after female Congress corporators were frisked and asked to get their purses checked by the security, while their counterparts from the ruling BJP were exempted from the process. 

 Congress members alleged that this was an attempt to suppress voice of the opposition and stopping them from raising issues of large-scale corruption by the ruling party. This was the first time in RMC’s history that female corporators were frisked and asked to hand over their belongings to sergeants. The ruckus began as soon as female Congress lawmakers were asked to get themselves checked before entering the board room at the RMC headquarters. Congress female members objected to the ‘insulting’ treatment and sat on the floor of the house in protest.
 
 Congress corporator Jagruti Dangar said, “There is no rule to frisk the board members. Even if there is one, why weren’t the female BJP members frisked by security personnel?” adding, “They (BJP) want to suppress the opposition. They wanted to stop us from highlighting the case of corruption where RMC paid Rs 150 for one glass of buttermilk at its function. BJP has no right to check the purse of female members.”
 
 After heated arguments and scuffle with security staff, Congress members came out with the banners ‘Save daughters from BJP, punish the rapists’. BJP corporators too waved banners saying ‘Very good Vijay Rupani, without rain you brought water to Aji’.
 
 Rajkot mayor Jaiman Upadhyay said, “In the past, female corporators of Congress had thrown lollipop at BJP members and also sprayed mosquito repellent in the board room which is a dangerous act. So, I had ordered security personnel to check purses of female Congress corporators.” On why female BJP corporators were not checked Upadhyay said, “Our corporators are disciplined and if anybody does mischief we will take action against them.”
