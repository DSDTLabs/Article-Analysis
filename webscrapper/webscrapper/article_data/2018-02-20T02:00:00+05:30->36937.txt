PATNA: Bihar Pradesh   Committee (BPCC)’s former general secretary Shambhu Singh Patel will be the party’s candidate for the Bhabhua assembly byelection slated for March 11.

 BPCC’s acting president Kaukab Quadri announced the candidature of Patel at the state party HQ, Sadaqat Ashram, in Patna on Monday. Patel will file his nomination papers on Tuesday.
 
 Patel is known for his proximity to senior state Congress leader Sadanand Singh. He was preferred over another ticket aspirant, Sunil Kumar Kushwaha, who is said to be close to former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar.
 
 Sadanand, however, denied that he helped Patel get the ticket. “Patel has been associated with the National Students’ Union of India and Congress for nearly 35 years,” he said and added Patel was the choice of the party’s central leadership.
 
 Quadri said Patel’s name was recommended by the block and district-level party workers of Bhabhua. “A list of 12 aspirants had been sent to the party leadership,” he said.
 
 Patel was the BPCC general secretary when Ashok Choudhary was the BPCC president. A Bhabhua native, he hails from a farmers’ family. He has a son who is a senior Navy officer. His daughter is married to a government servant.
 
 The bypolls are to be held for two assembly seats and one parliamentary seats. Congress ally RJD will field candidates from Araria parliamentary constituency and Jehanabad assembly constituency.
