PANAJI: The new eight-lane Zuari bridge, which is expected to be an attraction for tourists from the world over, is likely to have coloured cables in the cable-stayed section. 

 The contractors are considering using the cables to display different   in a bid to make the bridge visually appealing.   are likely to be installed on the bridge to provide the electricity required for the colour display, sources said.
 
 Illumination of a long cable-stayed bridge such as this one, plays a very important role in highlighting the structure and creating a location of tourist interest. The installation of permanent solar panels has already been executed in a number of major bridge projects in Japan. Different illumination schemes during different seasons are also being considered for the  .
 
 High density   (HDPE) ducts, which are UV resistant, are likely to be used on the cable-stayed section. UV-stabilized and coloured co-extruded HDPE ducts satisfy long-term durability and are also aesthetically attractive. Such ducts can be produced in any colour and the UV resistance depends on the tone chosen. 
 
 Such cable-stayed bridges with coloured ducts provide an impressive contrast against the backdrop of the blue sky. This has been considered in the design after detailed interaction with international suppliers for such items to ensure their availability for this project, sources said.
 
 Over seven km of the 13-km-long Zuari bridge project will be constructed at an elevated level in order to allow traffic to pass from below and enable vehicles using the bridge to pick up speed, on the lines of an expressway. It is thereby expected to reduce the 45-minute travel distance between Panaji and Margao considerably.
 
 As per the conditions of the ministry of road transport and highways, the contractor   (DBL), will have to complete construction of the bridge within three years and will be responsible for its maintenance for eight years.
