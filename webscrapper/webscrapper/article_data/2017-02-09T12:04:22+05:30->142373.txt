We want the police to investigate the case thoroughly,” said Sukhdev Singh, Rajinder’s father.
 
  said, “Rajinder had fallen ill on Tuesday night and died in the hospital. His father has alleged some foul play. The deceased’s viscera has been sent for chemical examination and we can say something (about the cause of death) only after getting the report.”
 
 However, the doctors attending the victim denied that he was poisoned. 
 
 Rajinder, 29, who worked at a sound system shop, had been under depression after Kulwinder’s sudden demise. Kulwinder was shot dead while she was performing on stage by an inebriated man at a wedding in Maur on December 4, 2016. The incident was filmed using a mobile camera. In the clip, which went viral after her killing, she could be seen getting shot and falling immediately on the stage. Police had registered a case against four people.
