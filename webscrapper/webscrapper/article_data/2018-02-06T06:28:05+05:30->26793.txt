GURUGRAM: The   (RTA) has sent show-cause notices to 18 pollution under control ( ) checking centres in the city for not following norms issued by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority under the graded plan. 

 The move comes following inspections carried out at the PUC centres, over the last two months, by the authority, where the centres were found to be flouting the rules.
 
 “Twelve centres didn’t have the equipment required to check the pollution level caused by a vehicle, six didn’t have trained staff to operate the system at a PUC centre, despite which they were issuing certificates to vehicles,” said an RTA official. 
 
 “We are glad that the RTA carried out inspections and sent notices to the defaulting PUC centres. We have also reported their existence several times to the authority. We hope to see an immediate and strict action against them as a violation of PUC norms is one of the major causes of vehicular pollution in the entire city,” said a senior official of HSPCB.
 
 Recently, the   government issued directions that all petrol pumps should have pollution checking centres in order to fight air pollution and to get rid of the illegal PUCs.
