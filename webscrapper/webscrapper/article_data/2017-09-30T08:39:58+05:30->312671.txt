AHMEDABAD: After the implementation of Goods and   (GST),   jewellery sales remained subdued. High prices of gold coupled with additional 3%   on gold jewellery has led to a subdued consumer sentiment thus causing a decline in gold demand. However, jewellers have pinned their hopes on the festive season, anticipating a revival of jewellery demand during the season.

 “Gold demand is directly proportional to the functioning of other industries and businesses. However, after GST implementation, several businesses are hit due to transition and therefore, consumer confidence dipped due to which gold demand is low key,” said Shanti Patel, president, Gems and Jewellery Trade Council.
 
 Gold price on Friday settled at Rs 30,500 per 10 gram. Some of the jewellers feel that the proposition to make submission of KYC documents of the buyer compulsory for purchases above Rs 50,000 after bringing the industry under Prevention of   Act (PMLA), is also impacting demand.
 
 On auspicious muhurats like Dussehra, a number of people tend to invest in gold and therefore, jewellers are hoping for slight improvement in sales. “Auspicious muhurats are usually preferred for gold purchases, however, the business is significantly slack and the proposal to bring the industry under PMLA itself is making customers all the more reluctant. Besides, the real effect of demonetization and GST is visible now,” said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
