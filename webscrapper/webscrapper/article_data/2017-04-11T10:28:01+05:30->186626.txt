 The bills was passed in the Gujarat assembly last year, amid protests from the  . A number of academic experts also met the governor and pleaded with him to not approve the bill. However, almost one year later, the governor signed the bill into law in February.
 
 The Gujarat State   Council Act 2016 will bring all universities in the state under the control of a Higher Education Council, which will be chaired by the chief minister.
 
 Sources close to the development said, “The state government has decided to implement the higher education council from the current academic session. The formalities are complete. The appointment of members is under way. A time has been sought from the CM for the first meeting of the council. The further course of action will be decided after that meeting.”
 
 The higher education council will include the CM as president, education minister as vice president and minister of state for education as co-vice president along with 12 other ministers (a total of 15 ministers). Five vice-chancellors of state universities will also be members. However, chancellors of state-controlled universities selected by the government and even vice-chancellors of all universities in Gujarat will not be able to choose their own nominees to the council.
 
 The law drew severe criticism from the education fraternity in the state, for the apparent attempt to clip the autonomy of educational institutes, while keeping academicians in the dark. Academicians, educationalists and representatives of student organizations opposed the law.
