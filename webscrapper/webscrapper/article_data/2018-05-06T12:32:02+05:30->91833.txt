NAGPUR: Social organization   has alleged that   is underway in the   ( ) since the past several years causing losses to the tune of Rs30 crore per year.

 The organisation also alleged that the civic body’s permanent and daily wage workers are forced to work at the houses of officials and corporators.
 
 Anil Chauhan, national secretary of Samata Manch, said in a press conference on Friday that NMC reinstated a sanitary worker who was suspended for the irregularity a few days ago.
 
 “The sanitary worker used to work in a private firm at LIC square. The worker’s elder brother, who worked in the NMC’s health department, was registering his bogus attendance. An inquiry exposed the irregularity following which the worker was suspended. But the worker was inducted back into service without recovering the salary amount. This has been happening in in the NMC for the last 17 years,” he said.
 
 Chauhan said many permanent and daily wage sanitary workers are not doing their work daily but their attendance is registered and salaries are also disbursed every month causing financial loss to the civic body.
 
 “There are 3,890 permanent and 4,300 daily wage sanitary workers in the NMC. Workers are suspended after complaints. But the irregularity has not stopped. I can prove that these workers are working in the houses of officials and corporators,” he said.
 
 Demanded CBI probe into the alleged irregularity, he said, “Taxpayers’ money is being wasted unabatedly. We have planned a series of agitation to expose more such cases in the coming days.”
 
 Samata Manch claim to have exposed various irregularities related to sanitary workers’ salaries, garbage collection and transportation in the NMC since 2001.
