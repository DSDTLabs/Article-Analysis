VISAKHAPATNAM: With   being sold for Rs 270 a dozen and Suvernarekha being sold Rs 300 a dozen,   lovers are overjoyed at the sudden drop in prices of their favourite fruit. Traders, however, have refused to feel positive. They pointed out that this relief is going to be short-lived, as these are only the first mangoes of the season and are doubtful of its further supply.

 Traders at   market predicted that prices of mangoes will soon hit the roof as supply of the fruit to   market are expected to drop drastically. Sources in the market disclosed that the volumes this year may not even reach the 1,00,000 tonnes mark, a far cry from the 2,40,000 tonnes of 2016.
 
 Besides, a mango orchard contractor from Makavaripalem Mandal, Ch Raju, observed, “ There is little mango left in the orchards of the four districts of north-coastal Andhra Pradesh. Last year, when the supply of mangoes had been average, the number of vendors had dropped from 35 to a handful on the Anakapalli and Tuni stretch. This year, there are just two so far on the   stretch. This is an ominous sign of things to come.”
