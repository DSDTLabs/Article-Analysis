BHOPAL: The   (MPBSE) has landed in trouble after “categorising” class X and XII results on the basis of caste, which was enough to spark a political row in the poll-bound state.

 
 The official result kit, handed to reporters on May 14, reveals that successful examinees were segregated into four categories:  , SC, ST and General. The result sheet clearly mentions the line ‘Vargvaar Niyamit’ (in accordance with category).
 
  was quick to label it a “caste-based” result system. MPBSE chairman S R Mohanty, however, maintains that the segregation is meant to ease welfare benefits for students. “From the data, candidates will easily get benefits of various schemes,” he said. Mohanty insisted that the MP board isn’t the only one to declare results this way. “What does caste-based result system even mean… I don’t understand.
 
 The categories are there to pass on benefits of government welfare schemes and we have been doing this for years. Why the unnecessary hype now,” he asked. Even CM   had to face some uncomfortable moments recently when an OBC student questioned him about “bias” towards SC/ST students, wondering why he didn’t get a free laptop, despite scoring in the high eighties, while his SC friend got one from the government though he scored far lower marks.
