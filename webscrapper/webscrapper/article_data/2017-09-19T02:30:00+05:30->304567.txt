Mumbai: In a relief to orthopaedic surgeon Dr Murarilal Saraf attached to Bombay Hospital, the Bombay high court on Monday stayed an order of the Medical Council of India (MCI) that had suspended his licence to practice medicine for five years.

 A bench of Justice Shantanu Kemkar and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai said it was an issue of principles of natural justice raised by the doctor who had challenged a July order of the MCI to deregister him for five years without explaining why. The court said it found that reasons were not mentioned in the orders by Medical Council of India (MCI) and Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC).
 
 “When you remove his name at least you are required to state reasons,’’ the bench said.
 
 Counsel Milind Sathe for Dr Saraf complained that the March decision by MCI ethics committee nor any other relevant material was supplied to his client. The MCI executive committee had confirmed the ethics committee’s decision to deregister Dr Saraf. The lack of material was hampering him from pursuing an appeal filed before the joint secretary, health ministry against the MCI Order, said Sathe, seeking a complete stay on the MCI order. The HC directed that the papers be handed to him. Aditya Pratap, advocate for the original complainant Nandini Suchde, opposed Dr Saraf’s plea for the stay. 
 
 Suchde had in 2013 alleged negligence against a group of doctors and also alleged that Dr Saraf was practising without registration for decades. Sathe, pointing out that MCI has exonerated “all treating doctors” said that Dr Saraf has an “impeccable record” since his registration with the MCI in 1971 and had paid a fine in 2012 amnesty scheme for delayed renewal and was issued a registration number . He also pointed out that since 2004 an amendment to the law provide no provision for removal of name from register for non-payment of renewal fee.
