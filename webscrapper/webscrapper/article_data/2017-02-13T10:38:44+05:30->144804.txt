GAYA: Calling legendary poet   the last classical and first modern poet, Aligarh University’s Urdu professor Seraj Ajmali has said Ghalib represented the best in classical as well as modern poetry.

 Speaking at the valedictory session of the two-day Ghalib Day celebrations organised by   in Gaya, Ajmali focussed on the multidimensional aspects of the poet and his poetry.
 
 In his introductory address, MG College’s PG department of English HoD Prof Ainul Haq said there was so much in common between Shakespearean verses and Ghalib’s couplets and a comparative study of the two all-time literary giants was required to bring out the commonality of ideas between the two.
 
 Earlier, Jamia Millia Islamia-Delhi’s Urdu professor Khwaja Ekramuddin described Ghalib as an extremely sensitive soul who differentiated between manhood and humanity. “Admi ko bhi mayassar nahin insan hona,” he said, quoting Ghalib.
 
 Prof Ahmad Mahfooz, in his presentation, said some finer aspects of Ghalib's poetry are yet to be fully appreciated and extra sensitive approach was required for the comprehensive appreciation of Ghalib’s poetry.
 
 Other speakers included Prof Shahpar Rasool and Prof Safdar Imam Qadri.
 
 Special sessions were also organised to pay tributes to Musanna Rizwi, Kalam Haidri and Syed Mohd Hasnain, the three Gaya-based literary figures who dominated the Urdu literary scene of the subcontinent in the last quarter of the 20th century. Posthumous tributes were paid to the trio.
