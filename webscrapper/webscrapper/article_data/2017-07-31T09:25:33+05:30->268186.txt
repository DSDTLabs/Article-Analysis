GUWAHATI: With 392   (JE) cases being reported out of a total 1328 Acute Encephalitis Syndrome ( ) cases so far in the state this year, the need for greater coordination between the medical fraternity and the community along with setting up of a full-fledged entomology directorate is being felt more than ever. 

 A senior health official on Saturday told TOI there is an urgent need for a full-fledged entomology directorate in the state to enhance the study of the vector responsible for causing JE, dengue, malaria and other diseases in view of the escalating number of cases reported in the past decade. 
 
 "The state government is considering it but is being unable to pursue the matter further because there is manpower shortage. A separate directorate will enable research and proper academic approach," said the official.
 
 The official added, "We all have the provisions. It is dependent on the government of India's guidelines. Programme such as the   ( ) and others are run by the government of India. The state and the Centre function in a concurrent manner. The programs are funded by the Centre and the state provides the manpower."
 
 Till now, there have been 53 deaths due to JE and 110 due to AES this year. Thirty nine years since the first outbreak of encephalitis was reported in Assam's   district, vector-borne disease experts are still unable to capture the exact diagnosis of 60% of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) cases. From 2010 to 2016, 9,835 AES cases were reported from different parts of the state. As many as 1,675 AES deaths were reported in the same period.
