VARANASI: Ustad Bismillah Khan’s grandson and two jewellers were arrested on Tuesday for stealing four shehnais of the late maestro. Nazre Hasan, who is in his early thirties, had stolen the shehnais from his own house and sold them for just Rs 17,000 to the jewellers, police said.

 Three of the shehnais, made of silver, were melted by the jewellers. Special task force (STF) SSP Amit Pathak said cops arrested Hasan and the jewellers, Shankarlal Seth and Sujit Seth, from Varanasi’s Piyari following a tip-off.

 Khan’s youngest son, Nazim Hussain, told TOI he was surprised that a family member was involved in the theft. STF officials said the silver shehnais were gifted to the maestro by former PM  , RJD chief   and   member  .
