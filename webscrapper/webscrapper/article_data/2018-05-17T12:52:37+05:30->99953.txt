SURAT : With only seven of the 23 affected families agreeing to the compromise formula over land for   bridge over river Tapi, the   ( ) has decided to acquire the required land and is waiting for nod from the state government.

 The last date for accepting the proposed compromise formula is already over.
 
 More than 85% of the bridge structure has been constructed. However, the issue of 23 residents had become a hurdle for the completion of the project. To overcome problem SMC had suggested a compromise formula under which the affected residents were to rehabilitated in houses on a 1,200 sq m plot. Land owners who own more than 50 sq m of land chunk were to get additional compensation in form of land.
 
 However, as the last date to accept the compromise ended on Tuesday only seven families of the 23 had agreed to the formula. Many of the affected families are demanding cash for land at market rate, while some are asking SMC to build their new homes too.
 
 SMC commissioner,   told TOI, “We have already sent a proposal for acquiring the land under land acquisition act and once the approval comes from the state government we will acquire the land. Under land acquisition act the affected residents would get less than what we had proposed.”
 
 The decision to build the Rs 89.99 crore bridge was taken in 2012 and after that number of issues cropped up that delayed the project. Talk of changing the site too came up and ultimately in 2014-15 after two years of legal battle SMC suggested three options of allotting more   to affected citizens, paying up cash compensation at jantri rate and plot allotment of same size in nearby area.
 
 Since there was no compromise, SMC standing committee gave all powers to the municipal commissioner, who in turn sought permission from government to acquiring the land.
 
 “We expect government clearance to come in next three months,” said an SMC official.
