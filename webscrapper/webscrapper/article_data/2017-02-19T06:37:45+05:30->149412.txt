HYDERABAD: A day after a city-based student   was deported from   (NZ), the   on Saturday temporarily stalled the deportation of the eight other students. According to a   NZ Herald, the students have now been requested to voluntarily leave the country.

 The problems arose as city-based agencies that facilitated the students’ travel to New Zealand had allegedly submitted fraudulent documents on their behalf to get the job done. The issue, however, has been hanging fire for eight months, with the students forced to camp at the Auckland Unitarian Church for the past two weeks.
 
 Reports suggest that the decision to withhold the deportation of eight students until February 22 was taken after long debates. According to NZ Herald, immigration general manager Stephen Vaughan has confirmed that the agency has agreed not to enforce deportation orders against the students while it considered a request from their lawyer to let them leave the country voluntarily. 
 
 In case the students agree to this arrangement, they can re-apply for student visa from India as per rules. They will not suffer the five-year ban on new visa applications that normally applies to people who are deported. 
 
 Expressing relief over the order, students’ lawyer McClymont told NZ Herald that it is a “win” situation for them. “This is an agreement by INZ (Immigration New Zealand) that they are willing to negotiate with the students about a solution that would enable them to test their eligibility for visas from offshore. If they were deported, they would be prevented from ever applying to come back to New Zealand or any other country,” McClymont said. 
 
 However, Anu Kaloti of Migrant Workers Association of Aotearoa said in a Facebook post that the conditions of departure (deportation, re-entry bans and character waivers) are still under negotiation. The association has also filed an online petition which gathered 812 supporters within a few days.
