HYDERABAD:   chief Asaduddin   Narendra Modi late on Wednesday for his ‘open arms’ welcome to   Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan.

 When the prince arrived in New Delhi to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest, Modi’s open arms gesture and hug amused Owaisi. Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, Owaisi said, “We respect our guests and the Prince definitely should have been welcomed befittingly. But it looked like Modi had forgotten to do his yoga in the morning. So, when the prince arrived in the evening, by his gestures, it looked like he was doing yoga with his open arms and welcoming the prince.”
 
 “If Modi has so much love for a ‘dadhiwala’ from abroad, why does he not show the same love to ‘dadhiwalas’ in India?” he said.
 
 Owaisi was careful not to use the word ‘Muslims’ as it would have violated the Supreme Court orders on seeking votes in the name of religion. The crowd responded with a round of applause and laughter when Owaisi used the word ‘mitron’ to imitate Modi. 
 
 “How can the Prime Minister claim that demonetisation had shown good results? How does he account for 120 deaths? Has he unearthed any black money?” he questioned.
 
 The MIM chief, who was cheered for his utterances against Modi and BJP, was applauded when he referred to Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh as a ‘drama company’.
 
 “The ‘bade miyan and chhote miyan’ are taking people for a ride by saying there is development in Uttar Pradesh. It is only the family which benefitted, not the common man,” he said. Owaisi questioned the claims of Akhilesh over the ‘so-called’ development that had taken place.
 
 MIM has fielded 11 candidates for the first phase of the elections.
