NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of   on Monday granted an interim relief to   shops owners by directing the district collector to allow opening of liquor shops on Thursday evening after the counting process is over.

 A division bench comprising justice   and justice Swapna Joshi directed government to file a reply within four weeks.
 
 The directives were issued after Maharashtra Wine Merchants Association knocked the judiciary’s doors challenging collector’s orders to keep liquor shops shut for three days — on Monday on the eve of municipal corporation’s polls, on Tuesday for polling and on counting day on Thursday. 
 
 The action was taken under the provisions of Maharashtra Country Liquor Rules, 1973, and   (Sale on cash and sales register) Rules, 1969. Both these laws deal with the provision of maintaining liquor free (Dry) day.
 
 The petitioners through counsels   and   contended that their members are paying huge amount towards licence fees to the Maharashtra government for carrying on their business. Therefore, keeping their business closed, even for a single day, caused huge losses to them.
 
 They pointed out that earlier also the high court passed several orders regulating the period of ban for selling liquor during elections. But in most of the cases, it was either restricted to a specific period and not for entire day on which polls were conducted or counting was held or results were declared.
 
 They said similar orders were passed by the collector of various districts, but there is no uniformity in them as far similar restrictions were concerned.
