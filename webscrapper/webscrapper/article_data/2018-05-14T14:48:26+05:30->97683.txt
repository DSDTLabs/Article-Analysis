PATNA: Contrary to the general perception that the state   brass boycotted the marriage ceremony of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son   Yadav on Saturday night, a few saffron party legislators did attend the function.

 BJP sources said state party president Nityanand Rai and health minister Mangal Pandey first called on Lalu at the 10, Circular Road residence and later attended the wedding rituals at the residence of  , whose daughter Aishwarya Rai wedded Tej Pratap. “They could not make it in time at the ‘jaimal’ function owing to their prior engagements,” they said and added that BJP’s Bankipore MLA Nitin Navin, Barh MLA Gyanendra Singh Gyanoo and MLC Sanjay Mayukh did attend the ‘jaimal’ function. 
 
 Among the   leaders besides CM Nitish Kumar, Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha also attended the ‘jaimal’ function. “Party-politics is one thing, but the marriage ceremony, or any such private function, are family matters. There should be no politics in the family matters. Leaders of political parties should maintain grace on such occasions,” Paswan said on Sunday.
 
 Mangal assails P Chidambaram: State health minister Mangal Pandey on Sunday attacked former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, saying the income-tax department has filed four chargesheets against his family members under the Black Money (Undisclosed Financial Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 in the Chennai special court on Friday.
