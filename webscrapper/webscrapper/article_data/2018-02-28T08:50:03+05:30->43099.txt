CHANDIGARH: A local court on Tuesday sentenced five people to 25-year jail term and fined them Rs 2.15 lakh each for abducting and raping a 16-year-old girl in September 2015. The convicts are Chadrashekar (18), Bansi (35),   (35), Shekhar Rana(20), and Sahil Verma (22).

 Terming it as a heinous crime, the court said the convicts do not deserve an inch of leniency. The court order said, “Such a heinous crime is not only against the victim but the society at large.” “The men who are supposed to protect the girl child have themselves ravished a small girl by forming a group, which is despicable. The victim will carry the scars of the crime her entire life,” the court order said.
