KOLKATA:   has bagged the opportunity of developing direct   with centrallyfunded research institutes based in and around Kolkata. Only 10 varsities have been chosen from across the country and   is the only one from Bengal and probably eastern India.

 
 “This is a recognition of excellence in teaching and learning process, which JU is attaining. There was always a dichotomy between the amount of financial support given to   compared to the state universities although the scientists did not have the exposure to the   in the universities. At the same time the varsity teachers couldn’t avail the excellent infrastructure facilities in the research institutes. This lack of convergence is now being addressed. We can do joint research projects and joint supervision of PhD,” said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.
 
 The government of India has identified JU as West Bengal’s only university among the top 10 varsities in the country to develop synergy between the university and centrallyfunded science research institutes. “This will allow JU to access to infrastructure facilities of central research institutes located in and around Kolkata like the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Central Glass and Ceramics Research Institute, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, SN Bose Institute, Bose Institute, Indian Association of Cultivation of Science and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,” added Das.
 
 The scheme will create opportunities of collaborative research between JU and such central institutes as well as joint supervision of PhD dissertations by the faculty members of JU and the above mentioned research institutes.
 
 The joint faculty council of science and technology as well as the executive council of JU have already accepted the central government’s proposal.
