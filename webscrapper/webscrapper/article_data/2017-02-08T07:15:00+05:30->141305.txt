  The team, which was headed by joint commissioner (crime) Sanjay Saxena and included DCP (cyber) Akhilesh Singh, senior inspector Neeta Phadke, cracked the case after watching the leaked print. The cops found a watermark, which led them to the Gwalior theatre. The producer said, "We learnt about the leak through our well-wishers on the day the film released. The movie was available on extratorrent.unblockall.xyz, youtube.com, zippymoviez.ch, openload.co, hideoxy.com. We incurred heavy losses due to the leak." 
 
 "The theatre owner and his son (the duo also runs a catering business in Gwalior) refuted the allegations. But the watermark revealed that the movie was recorded at the theatre," said the police.
