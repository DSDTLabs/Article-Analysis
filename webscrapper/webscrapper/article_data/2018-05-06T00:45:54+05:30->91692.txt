But after some time, they returned and started thrashing him. They forced him to hand over his wallet, mobile phone and debit cards. One of them placed an axe on his neck and forced him to reveal his pin. Four other men had joined them after this.
 
 After taking the cards, they left the room. A few hours later, they returned and took his power bank, shoes and other belongings. Later, they dropped him near a police station and fled.
 
 He informed his relative about the incident. Later, he reached Delhi and registered a complaint.
