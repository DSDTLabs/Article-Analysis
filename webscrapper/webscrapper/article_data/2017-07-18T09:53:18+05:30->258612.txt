MUMBAI: Saamna has urged   to remove the ' ' blot on the President's office. In an editorial, Saamna predicted a clean sweep for Kovind. The presidential election took place on Monday.

 Expressing satisfaction that Kovind represented the country's common man, Saamna said, “While the   boasts of a long political and administrative legacy, Kovind has no such background. He represents India's common man. He has many challenges ahead. He will have to prove himself...He will have to wipe out the stigma that the president of India is a mere rubber stamp,“ said the  .
 
 Saamna made it a point to remind the Modi regime that Kovind was not just a BJP nominee for the presidential poll. “Kovind is NDA 's nominee...The BJP may have earned new allies, but Akali Dal and Sena are NDA 's long-lasting friends,“ said Saamna. “Kovind should be considered as NDA nominee.“
 
 Stating that there was no need to lay emphasis on Kovind's Dalit identity , Saamna said to belittle the president's office by raking up the caste issue should be deemed as social crime.
