KOLKATA: A 36-year-old woman — a resident of   at   — has lodged a complaint alleging that she was wrongfully restrained, molested and slapped by a taxi driver. The incident was reported around 7.15 pm on Tuesday. The accused taxi driver is yet to be identified.

 According to the police, the woman had hailed the taxi from a south Kolkata location and had arrived at her hotel at Beliaghata. However, while getting out of the cab, she complained that she was being charged extra. This led to an altercation and the accused driver allegedly misbehaved with her, claimed the victim.
 
 The police said they have lodged a complaint under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntary hurt) and 354 (molestation). 
 
 Investigating officers spoke to the hotel management and other witnesses. 
 
  “We will record the statements of a few people who were present on spot at the time. We have also asked for CCTV footage to ascertain the truth,” said an officer. TOI tried to speak to the victim but she was not in the hotel when this correspondent reached there.
 
 “To the majority of us, the only redeeming factor in this transport sector is passengers. Leave them out and all that remains is dirt and muck. Hence, it does not make sense to refuse passengers. Of course, There are some rotten elements but most of us rarely refuse passengers during most of the day when we want to maximize earnings. It is only in the evening when the day’s fares add up to either fall short of target or exceed it that refusal happens,” said Abhijit Roy, a taxi driver.
 
 Last year in December, cops had nabbed the main accused — a taxi driver — in a molestation case in Rajarhat within hours of the victim approaching them seeking justice. The cab used to commit the crime too was seized.
