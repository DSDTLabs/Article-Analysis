RANCHI: State water resources minister   on Friday wrote to Union minister for external affairs Sushma Swaraj seeking her help in rescuing a dozen-odd labourers stranded in Malaysia. Of the 11 labourers sent to Malaysia, nine are from Bokaro and one each from Simdega and Giridih. 

 Speaking to TOI, Choudhary said most of the labourers hails from Bokaro's Bermo region, adjacent to his home constituency in Ramgarh. "Private companies often lure these villagers to work for foreign companies. The matter remains under wraps unless there is a problem," he said. 
 
 Choudhary said the labourers in Malaysia have neither been able to send money home nor are they being allowed to return. "Some of the family members of these labourers have said that their passports have been confiscated by the employment agency in Malaysia," Choudhary said. 
 
 In his letter, Choudhary said the labourers are also being tortured and held captive. "They are stranded for the past 10 months and are not being provided sufficient food," he said. 
 
 The families of these labourers are yet to approach the police. Bermo SDPO Subhash Chandra Jatt said he did not any information on any stranded labourers. "We will look into the matter and trace the agency involved in taking the villagers abroad," he said.
