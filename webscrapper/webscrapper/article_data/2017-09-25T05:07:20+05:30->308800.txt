NEW DELHI: The bigwigs of the telecom industry such as Reliance chairman   ( ), Aditya Birla Group’s Kumar Mangalam Birla ( ) and Bharti Airtel’s Sunil Mittal will descend on the national capital this week for a mobile summit at a time when the companies are pitted against each other over a host of issues such as interconnect charge, predatory tariffs, and poor financial health of the sector.

 Vodafone’s global CEO Vittorio Colao will also be participating, through video conferencing, at the   (IMC) organised by industry lobby grouping COAI.
 
 The conference will also be attended by various government functionaries such as telecom minister Manoj Sinha, IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan, IT secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney, and telecom regulatory chairman R S Sharma.
 
 The India conference — modelled around the Mobile World Congress (MWC)— is in its first edition and organisers hope to develop it as a crucial global telecom and IT platform.
 
 Local issues, especially around the tussle between telecom players and their poor financial position, are expected to hog the limelight. “However, with over 300 exhibitors from across the telecom and IT spectrum, we are confident that other critical issues will also be discussed, especially as we look at ‘Connecting The Next Billion’,” Rajan Mathews, director-general of COAI, told TOI. Representatives from companies such as Google, Qualcomm, Nokia, Ericsson Huawei, ZTE, Facebook and IBM will also be there.
