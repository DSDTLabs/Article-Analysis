 Gandhi, who claimed to work as a share broker, was sent to civil prison in civil court in the Bhadra area, said officials.
 
 The I-T department had asked its officers not to shy away from invoking the rare provisions of arrest, detention and auctioning of attached assets of the accused who smartly evade paying due taxes.
 
 According to tax officials, defaulters are rarely arrested in tax evasion cases as the last such arrest was done around 20 years ago. tnn
