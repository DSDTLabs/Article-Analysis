Mumbai: In yet another case where a citizen lost money after sharing   details, a 34-year-old Andheri homemaker was duped of Rs 49,000 after a caller claiming to be a bank executive, asked for her   details. After noting down the victim’s card  , the caller made three fraudulent transactions in matter of seconds. 

 The incident took place on May 10 when the woman got a   from an unknown number. The caller identified himself as a bank executive and asked the woman for her bank details. The woman initially did not believe the man and asked him to prove his identity, to which he immediately texted her his ‘employee ID number’. 
 
 In the complaint, the victim said, “I realized that I have been conned when I received three transaction alerts collectively worth Rs 49,000 on my mobile. The caller had asked for my card details as he said that I had failed to comply with the KYC norms three months ago. He warned me that the bank would block my card and also impose a Rs 5,500 fine if I did not furnish my card details to update my account.”
 
 On learning that she was conned, the victim lodged a complaint at the Andheri police station. Police said despite repeated warnings given through advertisements and text messages, people still fall prey to such calls and reveal their confidential details. Senior inspector Pandit Thorat confirmed the fraud but refused to divulge any details. A case under the Indian Penal Code and the IT sections for cheating and impersonation has been registered against the unidentified person.
