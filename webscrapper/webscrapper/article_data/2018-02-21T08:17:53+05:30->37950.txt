KOCHI: The district administration has launched a project to clean up the 18-kilometre  . 

 In the first phase of the project, steps will be taken to remove water hyacinths in the 5-kilometre stretch of the river starting from Konothupuzha to  , district collector   said on Tuesday, adding that he has issued instructions to the irrigation department to formulate an action plan within one week to restore the river. 
 
 In the second phase, the rest of the river will be cleaned up. The project will be carried out with private and public participation, similar to the way the   was restored.
 
 The river, which passes through four local bodies in the district, Udayamperoor, Chottanikkara, Amballoor and  , has turned into a sluggish stream filled with hyacinths. 
 
 The representatives of various resident associations in the area informed the collector that for the past four years the authorities concerned have not taken proper steps to remove the weeds from the river and it has resulted in water-logging. The authorities conducted trial operation of an amphibious machine, which can be used to dig up hyacinths at their roots from the river. 
 
 The Konothupuzha, a branch of the  , was once a major waterway in the region facilitating trade to neighbouring villages and serving as a major irrigation source to 3,500 acres of paddy land on its banks. The river turned into a shallow drain due to dumping of waste and unscientific irrigation bunds.
