KORAPUT: Practical classes have been affected at   and Hospital ( ) due to non-availability of a skeleton and a view box to examine X-rays. "Though bones of different body parts are available, it is inadequate," complained a first year student. 

 The students alleged that they have placed their problems before the authorities concerned many times but in vain. 
 
 On Friday, they tweeted about their problem to the   and health secretary. 
 
 Acknowledging that the medical college does not have a full human skeleton for practical classes, the authorities said efforts are on to get one or two skeletons at the earliest. "We are facing difficulties in getting original human skeleton as demanded by the students. Though few months back we had floated tenders for it, no one participated," said  , dean of SLNMCH. 
 
 "We need at least 10 skeletons for the first year students and the tender will be floated in a day or two," he added. According to the dean, though permission has been obtained from the health department to procure the skeleton locally, it is not available. 
 
 "We have brought bones of a few body parts from the medical colleges at Burla and Berhampur but it is inadequate. Efforts are on to get more bones of different body parts," Biswal said. The dean said the view box has arrived and it will be installed shortly for practical classes.
 
 The SLNMCH was inaugurated as the fourth medical college of the state last year with an intake capacity of 100 MBBS students. It is being constructed over 52 acres adjacent to the district hospital at an estimated cost of Rs 187 crore with 75% central assistance.
