NEW DELHI: The maharaja carrier   will soon start reserving seats for women on domestic flights, ANI reported.

 Six seats on every domestic flight will be reserved for women from January 18, ANI said.
 
 This is perhaps the first time in the world that seats will be reserved only for women passengers on planes. However, other modes of transport in India, including local and long-distance trains, metros and buses have reserved berths, seats or coaches for women. 
 
 The move comes after a recent on-board incident when 
  . During the flight, a business class passenger changed his seat to sit next to a female passenger in the economy class and allegedly groped her when she fell asleep.
