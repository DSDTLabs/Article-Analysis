PUNE: Solution to all civic issues in   ( ) areas is just an app away.

 The “KCB Samadhan” App, a mobile application on  , was launched recently by KCB president Brigadier   to address complaints related to civic issues on a daily basis.
 
 The idea behind launching the app is to ensure faster resolution of complaints, KCB officials said, adding that anyone can download the app and file a complaint. 
 
 “We have to use technology effectively and developing app for people’s convenience is the need of the hour. As soon as citizens post their issues, we will try to readdress them at the earliest,” chief executive officer (CEO)   told TOI on Monday.
 
 Currently, complaints can be posted in 13 categories such as garbage, street light, water supply, drainage, fire and other emergencies, hospital, school, among others.
 
 The cantonment officials said that they were chalking out a time frame to redress complaints received through the app.
