PUNE: The   (KCB) has decided to construct a library-cum-reading room for students living in cantonment and nearby localities.

 The board members passed a proposal to this effect at its last general body meeting and the same has been sent to the Headquarters, Southern Command, for final approval. 
 
 Amol Jagtap, KCB chief executive officer, told TOI, “There are many students who can’t focus on studies owing to inadequate space in their homes. We have proposed to construct the facility in the premises of the board’s Nehru garden, which is a centrally located place. Once we get clearance from the command headquarters, we will initiate the tendering process and a work order will be issued to the successful bidder subsequently.” 
 
 He said, “It is tough for many students to find an affordable space in the city. Sometimes, more than four students stay in a single room and that is not the best situation to study in. In a city like Pune not every student can afford to buy books and other related study materials. That’s why the board decided to set up the facility.” 
 
 A senior KCB official said, “The   will be equipped with sophisticated equipment. We will make sure that contemporary books are available in the library and adequate space is provided to students so that they can pursue their studies. We will try to ensure a flexible timing so that students in the night shift can also study.”  , a first-year engineering student, said, “It is the need of the hour to have a dedicated facility where students can walk in and study. We don’t have a public library in the cantonment and adjacent areas. It will be a big help for students.”
