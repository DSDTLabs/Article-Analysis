NEW DELHI: Addressing party workers at the newly-built BJP's headquarter in New Delhi, a triumphant PM   today dedicated the results of the assembly election in northeast to their hard work and lauded the journey of the party from being a “no one” to a party which, of late, has become synonymous with winning elections.

 
 “From being ‘no one’, BJP has won today,” the PM said.
 
  
  
 The Prime Minister began his address with a minute silence in memory of the party workers killed in political violence in various states of the country.
 
 "Be it Kerala, Bengal or Karnataka, the way two dozen workers were murdered there, when they can't fight to the face, they stoop down to this. Still we maintained silence. When we take action they cry 'vendetta'. This isn't vendetta but a mandate," the PM said.
 
 Attributing the success of the BJP to its workers, the PM said that they have been instrumental in party's transformation.
 
 "It is because of the hard work of the party workers that BJP has emerged as a sprawling “Banyan Tree” across the country," he said.
 
  
  
 Today, BJP dethroned the 25-year-old Left government in Tripura. The saffron party's victory in Tripura is quite certain, and if it forms the government in Nagaland as well, the tally of BJP-ruled states will go up to 21.
 
 At the start of his address, Modi took a brief pause when there was a call for prayers from a nearby mosque. He was also felicitated by senior party functionaries, including members of the BJP parliamentary board, headed by party president Amit Shah.
 
 Here is a look at important points from PM Modi's speech:
 
 
 * "To win or to lose in elections are a part of democracy. That is the beauty of democracy. One must accept their defeat with a sporting spirit."
 
 * "In ‘Vastu Shastra’, it is said that Northeast of a house is at the Centre. Things are organised keeping Northeast in mind. Similarly, our Northeast will lead the country’s development journey."
 
 * "I do not have the figures but I think the elected team in Tripura is the youngest ever team. Some of them were even scared that would be rejected on the grounds of their age. Such young candidates successfully won people's confidence."
 
 * "The Maoist ideology used fear and myth as weapons to the will of the people. The people of Tripura have responded to that fear by using their right to vote."
 
 * "The Sun is red at the time of sunset and turns saffron when it rises."
 
 * "At one point in time, BJP did not have structured organisation on the ground in many parts of the country. But today, it has spread to every nook and corner of the country due to sheer hard work and dedication of millions of selfless karyakartas."
 
 * "Congress party will be virtually left with only one CM in Puducherry in the country after they will be defeated in Karnataka in June 2018. In any case, Congress party doesn’t treat Punjab CM as their own, nor does Capt. Amrinder Singh treat Congress as his own."
 
 * "The Congress party has shrunk to its lowest ever size ever. There is a lesson to be learnt from this for other political parties, especially the BJP. We must not let ‘Congress culture’ creep in our party."
