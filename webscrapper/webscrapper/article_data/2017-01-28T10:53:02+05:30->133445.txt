JALANDHAR: Prime Minister   on Friday broke his silence on the contentious   (SYL) canal issue in his first rally in Punjab after assembly elections were announced but refused to make any specific commitment on the subject. However, the PM promised that Punjab would be given water drawn from Indus river but he did not elaborate on it.

 Addressing a rally in Jalandhar, Modi said, “Ab mujhe bataaie SYL nehar, Kya Punjab ke kisaan ko pani nahi milna chahiye jo Hindustan ka pet bharta hai? Wo dharti maa ko pani de. Kisan ko pani milna chahiye. Iske liye hum ne bahut bada, himmat se, faisla kia hai ke Sindu nadi ka pani, jis per hamaara haq hai, jo pani Paikstan mein chala jata hai. Hindustan ke haq ka pani hum lenge aur Punjab ki dharti ko wo pani denge. (Now tell me SYL canal. Don't Punjab farmers need water? Shouldn't Punjab farmers, who feed the entire country, get water? Farmers should get water. For this we have taken a very bold decision that water from Indus river, on which we have rights but is flowing into Pakistan, be given to Punjab. We shall take the water on which India has its right and will then give it to Punjab)“. In September last year, the 56 year-old   issue had cropped up following the Uri terror attack with India making it clear that “mutual trust and cooperation“ was important for such a treaty to work.
 
 Under the treaty, water of six rivers -Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum -were to be shared between the two countries.
 
 Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister   had pointed out that taking river water away from Punjab was the biggest wrong against it. He said earlier Congress regimes committed several excesses against the state, including religious, economic and political.
 
 “Our biggest issue is of water. We had water and our farmers fed the entire country . Water is nature's gift and not given by any government“ Badal said.
