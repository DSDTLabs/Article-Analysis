GURUGRAM:   of   have forced the municipal corporation of   (MCG) officials to stop the construction of the   asking them to   drains first. 

 “The construction of this road has been going on for the past one year. Due to the increase in the height of the existing road, water enters our homes every time it rains as there is no outlet. The authorities had promised us last year that they would build a drain alongside the road, but have failed to do so. This is why we have stalled the work,” said Amit Sharma, a resident.
 
 Others residents claimed that the authorities were hesitant in demolishing a couple of shops in the vicinity to build a drain. “We have been trusting the officials from the past one year. Our houses were flooded with water after last week’s rain. Left with no other option, we decided to protest against the road construction to put pressure on the officials to expedite the drain construction work,” said Kishore Yadav, another resident.
 
 However, MCG officials said that the construction of drain was underway and would be completed in a few days.
