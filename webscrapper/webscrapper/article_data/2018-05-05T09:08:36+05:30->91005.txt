JAISALMER: In order to revoke pride and honour for ‘Pokhran ki mati’ among the youth, youth wing members state   (BJP) will ‘worship’ sand brought in from   in all the 200 assembly constituencies of the state.

 To mark the 20th anniversary of the second nuclear test Pokhran-II, the party is celebrating May 11 as Yuva Shaurya Divas. As part of the celebrations, 200 earthen pots filled with sand from Pokhran were sent out to all the 200 assembly constituencies of the state. Events to worship these pots would be held from May 10 to May 13 across the state.
 
 While claiming that this is not a political event, the party is hoping to reach out to the youth of the state by holding such an event in the election year.
 
 On Friday, hundreds of members of the state yuva morcha had gathered at Pokhran to perform ‘pooja’ of the 200 earthen pots, in the presence   who was the chief guest at the event. “This event is being organised on the call given by PM Narendra Modi,” he said.
 
 BJP Yuva Morcha’s state president Ashok Saini said, “The Pokhran sand is as auspicious to us as vermilion hence, we applied that to our foreheads on Friday. This sand represents Shakti (power), Bhakti (devotion) and Shaurya (courage).” The wing also organised a procession of these pots through the town.
 
 IT Cell Coordinator Avinash Bissa said, “The conveners of all the assembly constituencies were handed over the earthen pots, who will take these pots back home. A special programme will be organised and the Pokhran sand will be offered prayers.’’
