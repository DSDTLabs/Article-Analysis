PANAJI: Two sitting MLAs of   ( ), speaker Anant Shet and sports minister Ramesh Tawadkar, whose names did not figure in the list of candidates declared by the party on Thursday morning, are likely to be dropped.

 Both met Union minister of road, surface and transport minister and Goa election in-charge   on Thursday morning in Panaji, when they were intimated about the party’s decision, a source said. Gadkari was in Goa to address party workers as well as meet party candidates. Tawadkar, when contacted, said he has been assured a ticket by the party, and denied that he is being dropped. Tawadkar also refused to comment, when asked what would be his course of action if he is not renominated.
 
 A source said the dismayed Mayem MLA, after his meeting with Gadkari, had told his confidantes that he would contest as an independent. BJP wants to give the Mayem ticket to Pravin Zantye, a former Congressman. “The battle for the Mayem ticket is unfair. It’s between one (Zantye) who has lost assembly elections twice, and one (Shet) who was elected for two terms,” said a BJP leader.
 
 He said the situation is not hunky-dory in Mayem, but it does not mean it is out of control either. Zantye has been considered for the Mayem ticket, only at the behest of a certain senior Union minister from Maharashtra, the BJP leader added. A source said BJP’s decision to drop them is also a result of its internal survey wherein it was revealed that both, Shet and Tawadkar, are on a sticky wicket.
 
 Surveys conducted by the party revealed that the performance of the two, particularly Tawadkar was below par. The party decided to bring former MLA Vijay Pai Khot on board, a measure taken to also checkmate the MGP which was considering him for the Canacona ticket, the source told TOI.
