INDORE: Indore branch of   (IMA) is attempting to categorise the health sector on the basis of services offered at a particular centre to remove disparity in calculating the tax amount.

 “The health sector is considered as an industry and tax levied has been standardised irrespective of the services being offered at a particular centre,” said city branch president, Dr  .
 
 He cited the current taxation system in the health industry as ‘inappropriate’ and emphasized on dividing the same into different categories for ‘fair’ tax calculation.
 
 “The tax should be calculated according to services being offered by the health centre. Number of beds, tests and other parameters should be taken into consideration while calculating it,” he said.
 
 The IMA president said there are big hospitals in the city which pay the same tax as small clinics.
 
 “We have brought the disparity to the notice of Lok sabha speaker and Member of Parliament (MP, Indore), Sumitra Mahajan. She has assured us that she will look into the matter,” Dr Londhe said.
 
 A team of doctors led by Dr Londhe had recently met Mahajan with various demands including one to prepare fresh guidelines of the pollution control board for the pathology labs and hospitals being operated in the city.
 
 They also urged Mahajan for her intervention in the pollution control board’s rule to recover money from pathology labs and hospitals over the disposal of bio-medical waste generated.
 
 “The health centres are being forced to deposit an amount calculated since 1998 while it should be calculated from 2016. Mahajan has written to state minister   on the matter to take appropriate action” Dr Londhe said.
