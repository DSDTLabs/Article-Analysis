AURANGABAD: The   bench of the Bombay high court has refused to confirm the capital punishment given by a special court to two youths convicted of raping and murdering a four-year-old girl who lived in their neighbourhood in 2016. It instead slapped on them a 30-year jail term without remission. 

 The HC cited the case as not falling in the "rarest of rare" category and also the young age of the duo as grounds for overturning the lower court's ruling. On January 7, 2016, the duo from   -   (18) and Rahul alias   (19) - had lured the girl on the pretext of giving her a chocolate. They raped her before killing her by stuffing her mouth with raw cotton. The body of the girl was recovered from a fertilizer bag kept in the house of one of the accused.
 
 The bench said that though the accused could be held guilty under section 302 of the IPC, it was not clear whether they intended to kill the minor girl or not. "The offence of murder in this case is not diabolical though rape and sodomy are brutal. The extreme young age is recognized as mitigating circumstance. Hence we hold that this is not the rarest of rare case. However, considering the gravity and seriousness of the offences, we feel it necessary to hold that the imprisonment for life should not be less than 30 years without remission," the bench said.
