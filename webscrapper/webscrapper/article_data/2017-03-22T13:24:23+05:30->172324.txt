  Krishna Das and some of the other accused in this case are also arraigned as accused in the case relating to the unnatural death of Jishnu Pranoy on January 6. Interestingly, the arrest has been made on the day when the family of Jishnu had threatened to launch indefinite fast in front of the office of the DGP in Thiruvananthapuram to protest against the delay in the arrest of the accused in the Jishnu death case. The police and government had to face a series of criticisms for the delay in the arrest of the accused as the court had granted only anticipatory bail to Krishna Das.
