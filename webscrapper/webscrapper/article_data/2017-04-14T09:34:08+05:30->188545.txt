INDORE: The brother of the deceased, who was with him when the attack took place on Wednesday, claimed the miscreants tried to to kill him but he managed to save himself by hiding in a field.

 While speaking to police officials, Anil Singh claimed that the accused got into a scuffle with his brother, following which they stabbed him and pelted him with stones. When he tried to intervene and save his brother, the accused started to thrash him.
 
 Anil tried to shout for help but there was no one in the vicinity. “They were following me and they had knives and big boulders in their hands. I ran for my life and hid in a field. They kept looking for me for some time and then went back,” said Anil.
 
 He also told police that there were two cars without registration plates at the spot while they beat his brother and chased him. He suspected the people sitting inside were also involved in helping the accused escape from the spot.
