NEW DELHI: The CAG report says not a single toilet was constructed under the   Bharat Mission in two-and-a-half years since its inception and funds amounting to Rs 40.31 crore remained unused. It has pulled up Delhi government for not giving adequate importance to implementation of the Mission and for not releasing funds to the urban local bodies within the given period.

 According to the report, the state government received Rs 2.26 crore in March 2015 and Rs 27.97 crore in November from the Centre for construction of   but released Rs 40.31 crore to the implementing agencies only in January 2016. The funds should have been released within 30 days of receipt of the central share along with the state share. The audit noted that due to the delay, the funds could not be used in 2015-16. 
 
 The monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the scheme did not function effectively, says the report. “During 2015-16 and 2016-17, GNCTD made provision of Rs 1.01 crore and Rs 212.30 crore, respectively under the mission. North DMC, South DMC, NDMC, DUSIB and DCB (Delhi Cantonment Board) did not see the necessity of constructing household toilets in their area whereas East DMC found necessity of constructing only 11,117 household toilets against 56,734 projected by the Government,” the report states. 
 
 South DMC and DCB did not construct community toilets though the Government of India had estimated a requirement of 718 and 408 community toilets, respectively. North DMC and East DMC constructed only 205 and 120 public toilets against 4,116 and 1,972, respectively, projected by the Centre, the report states. 
 
 The report says that SDMC did not project any requirement for construction of community toilets and public toilets under the mission citing space constraints. “South and North DMCs did not consider unauthorized colonies for projecting requirement of individual household toilets stating that they do not have jurisdiction over them, thereby leaving unauthorised colonies out of mission coverage with regard to household toilets,” observed the report.
