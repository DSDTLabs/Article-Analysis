CHENNAI: After dithering for nearly three months, the government   police registered two cases for transporting banned gutka by train in Madurai and Dindigul.

 In February, railway police force (RPF) had seized around 200 cartons of gutka and   from Delhi-Kanyakumari Thirukkural bi-weekly express in Madurai railway station. The action came in the wake of Chennai-based rights and advocacy group Arappor Iyakkam releasing a video on how gutka was being illegally transported by the express. While RPF personnel claimed they were under pressure to go easy on the transportation of the banned substances, GRP officers said they had received no information on the seizures. In the meanwhile, on April 23, RPF seized more gutka and pan masala, worth Rs15 lakh, from the same train when it halted at Dindigul.
 
 After the two seizures came under intense media scrutiny, Pon Manickavel, inspector-general of police, Railways, directed the state railway police to take charge of the confiscated goods and to register an FIR. While a case was registered for the seizure in Madurai on April 23, an FIR was filed for the Dindigul case on April 27. “We have asked railways to provide us with information on who made the booking for the parcel van in the said train which arrived from Delhi,” said a senior GRP officer. The cases have been currently registered against “unknown persons”. 
 
 The move comes close on the heels of a Madras high court order for a CBI probe into the alleged multi-crore gutka scam in which involvement of state   C Vijaya Baskar and director general of police T K Rajendran are suspected.
