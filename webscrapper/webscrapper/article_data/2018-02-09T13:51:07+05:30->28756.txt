 For most continent winners, it was their first trip to India. Talking about her experience in India, Stephanie Jayne Hill, Miss World Europe, said, "My experience here has been incredible. I always wanted to visit Delhi, and now that I am here, I feel so wonderful. I wanted to see as much Delhi as possible, but we had limited time, so I am definitely going to come back soon to explore the city. I loved the architecture here and I got a very warm welcome from the people here. Some events we attended were in buildings that I was told by people were built by the British. It is a part of our history and it was so lovely to find that connect here."
 Ha Eun Kim, Miss World Asia, said that she was glad to meet the External Affairs Minister  . "We had a chance to meet the Indian   and I was impressed with the fact that she is a woman. Our foreign minister is a woman too. When you see women taking up such strong positions in the society, you feel proud to be a woman yourself," she said and added that a visit to the Taj Mahal is on her bucket list and that she will return to India to visit it.
