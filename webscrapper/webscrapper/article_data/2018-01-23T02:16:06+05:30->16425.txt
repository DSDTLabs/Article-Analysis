Vellore:   Banwarilal Purohit on Monday flagged off a Swachh Bharat Mission rally at the   new bus stand and took an oath with students, sanitary workers and volunteers to end open defecation.

 The governor, accompanied by collector S A Raman, Vellore Corporation Commissioner P Kubendran and officials from the health department first visited the micro compost centres at Gandhi Nagar to inquire about its smooth functioning. He also watched a street theatre performance emphasising the importance of building individual household toilets. 
 
 After returning to the Circuit House, he met the public, farmers and representatives of NGOs and received petitions. The collector received the petitions in Tamil from the farmers and public, and explained the content to the governor.
 
 However, several persons expressed disappointment alleging they were not allowed to submit their petitions. “We were informed that the governor will meet and receive petitions from the public from 11 am. I reached here at about 10.40am, but the police and revenue officials did not allow me inside the Circuit House,” said an octogenarian.
 
 Officials said that around 25 to 30 persons were allowed to meet the governor. Purusothaman, who retired from Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation two years ago, was the first person to meet the governor. “I have submitted a petition and pleaded him to help me to get my arrears and retirement benefits,” he said.
 
 Later in the day, he visited the Government Vellore Museum, ASI Museum and Jalagandeswarar temple before leaving for Chennai.
 
 Nearly 300 party cadres of the DMK, led by party district secretary (Vellore Central and Anaicut) MLA A P Nandha Kumar and Vellore MLA P Karthikeyan showed black flags to the governor when he was going to inspect the micro compost yard.“Governor conducting review meetings and inspecting schemes in person is unconstitutional. Hence we are registering our protest against it,” he said. TNN
