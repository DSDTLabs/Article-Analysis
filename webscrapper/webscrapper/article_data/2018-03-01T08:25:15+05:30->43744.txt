KOLKATA: Education minister Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday faced questions from a member of his own party, an MLA from   and fellow cabinet colleague  , in the assembly. 

 As Chatterjee tabled the budget for discussion on higher education, science and technology, and biotechnology, Chattopadhyay said the job of the government does not end at allocating funds to the institutes. "The main objective of the government should be to improve the quality of education and achieve excellence," he said. 
 
 The minister of technical education said there didn't seem to be enough initiatives by the state to improve the quality of higher education. "Whatever is being done is by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The government needs to take initiative. The higher education minister is trying to improve the quality of education, but not much effect can be seen," he added.
 
 He also criticised the role of both Presidency University and  , saying these two had diverted from their main aim of teaching and research.
 
 Partha Chatterjee said that the government was making every effort to improve the quality of higher education in the state and achieve excellence.
 
 Chattopadhyay, however, lauded the attempts being made by Chatterjee in other sectors.
