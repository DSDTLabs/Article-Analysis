   home minister Ramalinga Reddy on Wednesday said   leader  , who splashed petrol in a BBMP office and threatened assistant revenue officer  , will be arrested at the earliest. 

 The minister told the legislative assembly that Changalrayappa will not be suspended though he was to face action for not reporting the February 16 incident. The minister told the assembly that Narayanaswamy is a senior party worker, but that "doesn't mean that he can do anything. I've asked police officials to take up the case seriously and bring the accused to book. The police have launched a hunt to track him down."
