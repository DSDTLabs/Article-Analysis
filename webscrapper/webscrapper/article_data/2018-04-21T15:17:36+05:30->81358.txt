Getting popular awards is one thing, and getting honoured by the state government is another. And   Aishwarya Majmudar, who won the Gujarat State Award for Best Playback Singer recently for the third time, feels honored that her efforts and hard work has been appreciated by the state government.
She says, "This is the third time I have been honored with this award, and I feel really blessed. I am thankful to the jury, my audience and the state government who considered me deserving enough to receive the award for the third time. My audience has embraced me and my music since the time I stepped into the music industry. Receiving the award for the best playback singer for the year 2015-16 is in itself a big honour, as my talent, my music and singing has been recognized by everyone."
 We wish her all the best for all her future musical projects.
