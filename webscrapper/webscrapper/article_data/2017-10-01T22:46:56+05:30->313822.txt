Bijnor: In a bid to check copying and make the the examinations transparent, the district inspector of schools (DIOS) has announced that only those schools and inter colleges which have CCTV cameras installed in their premises will be made examination centres. According to official sources, there are 357 high schools and intermediate colleges in the district but only 30% have installed CCTV cameras. Around one lakh students will take the board exams in the district.   The UP board exams are to be scheduled soon and the education department is gearing up to make preparations for the same. On September 26, chief minister Yogi Adityanath instructed all officials concerned not to conduct exams in schools and colleges that do not have CCTV cameras.    Giving details, DIOS R K Singh, said, “Last year, there were 160 examination centres in the district. This time, we have been instructed to hold the board exams in only those schools or intermediate colleges that have installed CCTV cameras.”    “The step is being taken to make exams more transparent and prevent cheating,” said Singh.    "We had sought a report of all schools and colleges to know whether they have installed CCTV cameras. According to the report, only 30% of schools or inter colleges have such an infrastructure. We have now asked the authorities of schools and colleges to install CCTV cameras. If they do not follow the directive, such institutes will not be made examination centres.”
