Ghaziabad: District magistrate   imposed the National Securities Act against former   on Tuesday. 

 Sharma is in jail in connection with the murder of a local BJP worker in Khoda in September 2017.
 
 The DM confirmed to the TOI that provisions of the NSA have been imposed against Sharma and a report has been sent to the state government. Sources in the district administration said after imposition of the NSA, Sharma will have to remain in detention for a maximum period of 12 months.
 
 An administration official told TOI, “The final decision to approve this order rests with the state government. The act has been invoked against Sharma in presumption that he might be involved in unlawful activities if released from prison.”
 
 In October 2017, Sharma surrendered before a   court after being named as an accused for criminal conspiracy in the murder of BJP worker Gajendra Bhati in Khoda. 
 
 Bhati had allegedly been gunned down by two men in Khoda in September 2017, one of whom, Narendra Gujjar alias  , was a former personal security guard of Sharma. Fauji, who was arrested around a fortnight after the murder, confessed that he had committed the crime after Sharma assured to pay him Rs 10 lakh in return.
