Vadodara: Workers at RR Kabel, one of the leading cable and wire manufacturers, called off their strike on Wednesday. 

 They had gone on strike on March 2 after the management removed 11 permanent employees and another 100 contractual workers were allegedly sent home. 
 
 The workers had sat on protest outside the company’s plant in Waghodia and demanded that the management take back all the sacked employees. 
 
 The company had taken back four of the 11 employees on work but the protesters wanted all to be reinstated. “The workers have called off the strike as the matter has been settled amicably. They will resume the work from Thursday,” said Vikram Raval, deputy general manager (administration), R R Kabel. Sources said that the management didn’t reinstate the seven employees but promised adequate compensation to them. 
 
 The worker union too confirmed that they have called off the strike but claimed that the management hasn’t given any compensation. “We have been promised that the seven sacked employees and 100 other contractual workers will be reinstated. So we called off the strike,” a union member said. 
 
 Several workers of R R Kabel had gone on strike alleging that the management was making them work for long hours but wasn’t giving any overtime. The tipping point came when the management sacked some permanent employees and transferred two of them.
 
 The management had claimed that the some workers had indulged in misconduct and there were disciplinary issues that led to their sacking. Raval had also said earlier that no contractual worker was removed and only seven were sacked.
