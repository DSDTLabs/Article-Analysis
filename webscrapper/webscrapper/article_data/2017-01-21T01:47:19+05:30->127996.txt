GURGAON: Demanding   and other benefits, over 1,000  , including accredited social health activist (ASHA),   and   staff, in Gurgaon joined the nationwide strike on Friday. The agitators carried out protest march in different parts of the city and demonstrated in front of the deputy commissioner's (DC) office where they submitted a memorandum. 

 In the memorandum, the workers demanded the budget allocation for Anganwadi workers to be increased to Rs 36,000 crores, no privatisation of the sector, permanent stature to the workers as Grade 3 and Grade 4 workers of government with a minimum salary of Rs 18,000 per month, paid maternity leave of at least 180 days and all benefits such as gratuity and pension.
 
 “We have been demanding equal pay to permanent staff. However, our demands have constantly been ignored. As we were left with no option, we submitted a memorandum containing our demands at the DC’s office for early action,” said Meera Devi, president of Asha worker Association.
 
 However, some protesters alleged the state government had withdrawn all benefits provided to them by the previous government. 
 
 “While we used to get Rs 500 per month earlier and bonus per delivery, this government has withdrawn the benefits. It is unfair. We will keep putting up protests unless all our demands are met,” said   from an association.
