INDORE: A baby boy, barely a day old, was found packed in a polythene bag and thrown into a clump of thorny bushes in a dried nullah in  . Left to die, it survived and had its first sip of milk on Saturday evening. Doctors hope he will live. Morning walker  , 39, heard a baby's cry while returning home. He thought it came from a ditch alongside   but couldn't see the baby. "There were two women standing near the ditch, looking tense. They, too, had heard a baby's cry but couldn't spot anything," Chouhan told TOI. 

 Then, he was horrified to see the little one squirming in a plastic bag. He still had umbilical cord intact.
 
 The rescuers wrapped him in a borrowed dupatta and dialed 100. "But no one came for some time so some of us went to   square and asked police to come along with us," Chouhan said.
 
 Police officers arrived and called for an ambulance. "We got the information at 7.44am and rushed to the spot in a few minutes. The condition of the baby seemed unstable as it was abandoned soon after delivery. The baby was provided first aid in the ambulance," said  , head constable at Rajendra Nagar police station who was on FRV duty. The baby was taken to MY hospital, where doctors removed the placenta and set about saving its life. TOI learnt that the baby's condition had improved by evening and he was fed some milk.
