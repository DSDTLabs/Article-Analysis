It’s visual treat at the Kanakakkunnu grounds in the city with the annual   going on in full swing. 750 orchid plants in 50 varieties, more than 50 types of hybrid roses, six kinds of dahlia, 12 varieties of petunia, double-shaded bougainvillea, varieties of aselia are some of the floral delights at the venue.
While some of the crowd pullers include floral sculptures and varieties of roses, the fruit bearing trees are another attraction.
 
 From hybrid fruits like strawberry guava, seedless jackfruits in pink, red and rose flavours from Thailand, Chinese orange and pear apple to our own sweet Ambazhanga, the fruits have been a big draw at the event, attracting a large number of denizens to get a taste of the event.
 
 However, it’s the Capel fruit, a variety from Malaysia, which has become a huge hit among the visitors. According to the organisers, the fruit when consumed can give the eaters the benefit of a sweet scent when they sweat.
