CHARMINAR:  , the once   may still have its huge courtyard and gardens intact. However, the rear side of the palace has been turned into a dumping yard and a urinal spot by  .

 Traders dump waste along the palace's wall. “Every day many people are seen urinating on the palace wall. Some traders dump waste here. Irresponsible citizens have tarnished the image of Chowmahalla Palace.
 
 Although its everyone's duty to safeguard historical monuments in Hyderabad, the   (GHMC) does not seem to be bothered about keeping the area clean,'' one of the residents, Md Khasim told TOI.
 
 Locals point out that the stench from the dumpyard is unbearable. It becomes difficult for people to even stand for a minute behind Chowmahalla palace.
 
 “Despite making several complaints, the issue has not been addressed so far by the concerned authorities. The garbage pile is increasing due to official apathy,“ added another trader.
 
 GHMC needs to take note of this matter seriously and plant saplings around the place, said city environmentalists. “The greenery outsi de the palace will not only add to its beauty, but will also curb irresponsible citizens from destroying the place,'' a resident, Md Fareed said.Unlike the outside, several steps have been taken in the past to improve the conditions inside the palace.
 
 In 2012, Mahtab Mahal inside the palace was turned into a library after books from the Nazri Bagh and Chiran Palace was brought to Chowmahalla, enabling research scholars to study more into the Asaf Jahi dynasty .After the Nizam's family decided to throw open the palace to public in January 2005, it took 5 years to restore the first courtyard.
 
 “If they could restore it to its former glorious past, why can't they do it outside too,“ asked a tourist D Asish on Friday .
