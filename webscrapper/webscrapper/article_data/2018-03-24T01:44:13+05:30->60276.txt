GURUGRAM:   garbage collection centres and holding monthly meetings for increased participation of resident, are part of the plan drawn up by   for better implementation of the integrated waste management system in Gurugram.

 Following repeated complaints from residents who are unhappy with the current garbage collection process and lack of cleanliness in their areas, MCG commissioner   held a meeting on Friday and discussed ways to improve sanitation across the city. It was decided that after identifying the locations of garbage collection centres, the spots would be geo-tagged and shared with people through the MCG website and other mediums.
 
 “A geo-tagging link will be developed for   centres so that any person, agency or contractor can locate them easily. The corporation’s IT department will take care of the geo-tagging task,” said Yadav.
 
 The commissioner further said all complaints and concerns related to  , the private firm roped in by MCG for the integrated waste management in the city, would be regularly discussed with the residents. For increased involvement of the public, the commissioner said a meeting would be held on the last Wednesday of every month to discuss various issues related to waste dumping and management.
 
 “The agenda for every meeting would be put up on the MCG website and will be communicated through SMS two days in advance,” said an MCG official. To tackle construction and demolition waste, MCG has decided to set up one dumping and collection centre in each of the 35 municipal wards in the city. Currently, there are a total of 17 C& D centres located across four zones.
 
 Ever since Ecogreen began door-to-door waste collection, there have been a lot of complaints from residents, who have alleged that the model adopted by the agency is against the idea of segregation at source.
