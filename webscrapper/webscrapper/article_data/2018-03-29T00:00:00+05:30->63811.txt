Some songs remain special, not because they’re a party track or because they have sizzling chemistry between the lead pair of a film. These songs are special because they add something extra to the narrative or have a quirky touch that makes the movie memorable. Topping the list in the first edition of Chennai Times Best Special Songs of 2017 is arguably one of the most played songs of the year — Tasakku Tasakku from Vikram Vedha. This song, which helped showcase the fun side of Vijay Sethupathi in the crime thriller, was composed by Sam CS and has vocals by Mukesh, MLR Karthikeyan and Guna. The list also features some other energetic numbers, including  , Ada Ada Maharaniki, Rangu Rakkara, Happy New Year, Laala Kadai Saanthi, Pattaya Kelappu, Tinga Tinga, Enga Veetu Kuthuvilakkey and O Sone.
