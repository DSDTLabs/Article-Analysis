AMRITSAR: After taking possession of  , Karachi, which had remained closed for nearly two and half decades, and installation of Guru Granth Sahib, the gurdwara management has sought help from the   for implementation of ‘maryada’ (religious code of conduct).

 Talking to TOI on Thursday, president of Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha, Hira Singh said currently Sindhi Hindus perform kirtan but they were not ready to leave their villages and come all the way to Karachi. He said the sabha wanted “sabat surat” Sikhs (with unshorn hair) to perform kirtan in the gurdwara. He said the sabha had written to the SGPC for sending a minimum of two trained kirtan singers to Karachi in this regard.
 
 Stressing on the need to train kirtani singers, he said such persons from prominent Sikh seminaries would not only help restore ‘maryada’ but would also train local Sikhs in singing hymns as per ragas described by Gurus. He said no doubt that Sindhi Hindu preachers perform kirtan but a turbaned Sikh preaching Sikhism would leave a better impact on the growing Sikh community of Pakistan.
 
 After a legal battle of 24 years, the sabha was given the possession of the gurdwara, which had got involved in a litigation over a disputed land with a group of local non-Sikhs. Hira said that on Thursday, the sabha held a meeting and wrote to the SGPC for sending them two kirtanis. 
 
 “We will not put any financial burden on the SGPC and bear all expenses, including salary, both way fare and accommodation for Sikh preachers,” he said, adding that many Sikh youths had already expressed a desire to undergo training in reciting   and performing kirtan.
 
 Criticizing the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) for having failed to train local Sikhs in performing kirtan, preaching Sikhism and implementation of maryada in gurdwaras of Pakistan, he said the PSGPC was not an independent body, so the sabha had already refused to accept its supremacy.
