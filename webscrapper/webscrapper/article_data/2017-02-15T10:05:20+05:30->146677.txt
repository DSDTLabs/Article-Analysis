 The railway lines passing from the district had divided the district in many parts. The movement of trains would check the movement of vehicles, police force, para military forces and administrative officers when the railway crossing would be closed for passing of train.
 
 In case of emergency, forces and officers may not reach in time if the railway crossings get closed. Therefore, minimize the movement of trains on that day and fix minimum closure time for railway crossing so that movement of polling parties could not be disturbed.
