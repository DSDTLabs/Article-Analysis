YAVATMAL: “In the ensuing election for   and Panchayat Samitis, the   of Western Maharashtra should be kept at bay,” said former MP and pro-Vidarbha leader   here at a press conference recently.

 Training his gun at leaders like Uddhav Thackeray, Raj Thackeray, Narayan Rane, Prithviraj Chavan and Ashok Chavan, Dhote said that people of Vidarbha would never pardon them for their opposition for the formation of a separate state of Vidarbha and added that they are merely lobbying for combined Maharashtra and their plea of ‘apla manus’ is ‘fake and the outcome of their political hypocrisy.’ “How can it be justified when there are a number of Hindi speaking states in the country and they all are doing far better for their own people,” Dhote asked.
 
  “After India’s independence, the statehood demand received overwhelming response but vested interests from Western Maharashtra sabotaged the movement by shaking hands with the self-centred Congress leaders of Vidarbha,” Dhote said.
 
 Praising BJP for its support towards statehood to Vidarbha, Dhote said PM Narendra Modi and CM Devendra Fadnavis would take a positive stand in response to their party’s resolution at the national executive meeting and the public commitment during the last election.
