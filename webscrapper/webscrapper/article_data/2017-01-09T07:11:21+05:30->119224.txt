AHMEDABAD: Unable to come to terms with the   fixed by her parents, a   committed suicide at her residence in   late on Friday night. Police said that the girl took the extreme step while her parents were asleep.

 Ramol police received a call at about 6am on Saturday from some local residents informing them about the suicide of the girl. “We found the girl hanging from a ceiling fan with her dupatta. We have sent the body for post-mortem,” said a senior police official.
 
 The girl’s family members told the cops that she had run away from her home twice in the past and hence they had fixed her engagement to avoid embarrassment.
