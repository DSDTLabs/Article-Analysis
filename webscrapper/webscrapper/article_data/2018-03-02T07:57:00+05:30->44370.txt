Ludhiana: In a major crackdown against companies involved in bogus billing and usurping huge amount of tax, the state taxation department on Thursday conducted inspection of two Ludhiana-based hosiery companies — one of which is a leading manufacturer of inner wear and thermals. According to sources in the department, action has been taken as these companies had taken purchase bills worth crores from conmen operating the bogus billing network, and used these bills to take tax credit worth lakhs from the state taxation department.

 Action against these firms was held under instructions from the joint director of investigation, HPS Ghotra, and deputy excise and taxation commissioner Pawan Garg. Source also informed that after the search, one of the firm which is located near Jalandhar bypass has deposited tax worth Rs 30 lakh while the other firm which is located at Noorwala Road has deposited tax worth Rs 19.44 lakh on the spot.
 
 HPS Ghotra — under whose instructions action on the Noorwala Road Hosiery firm was held — said: “We had specific inputs that the firm was involved in bogus billing and had fleeced the department of lakhs of rupees of tax during the past few months. A team of officials led by assistant excise and taxation commissioner Magnesh Sethi had been keeping a tab on the activities of this firm for quite some time now, and when we got enough evidence, we undertook the action today. After our team conducted the search today (Thursday), the owner of the hosiery firm admitted his mistake and he deposited a cheque worth Rs 19.44 lakh to us on the spot.
 
 Ghotra also added that the department would take strict action against firms involved in bogus billing, who are fleecing the government by adopting illegitimate means. “We are recommending strict action as per new laws against the offenders, so that an example could be set for others flouting the norms,”added Ghotra.
