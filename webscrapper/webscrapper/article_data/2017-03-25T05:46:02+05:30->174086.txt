AHMEDABAD: The primary report of   formed to probe 14 allegations of corruption against then chief minister  , has found no substance in a majority of the allegations.

 This was announced by deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Friday during the discussion on the commission. The deputy CM announced that the report was in 22 volumes and 5500-pages-long. “The government is studying the report and we will soon table it in the House,” Patel said.
 
 Leader of opposition  , demanded that the government table the report in the   by March 30 or 31, the day the assembly ends.
 
 “The government should announce the date as we don’t want to drag this corruption issue for long as it is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Vaghela said. “The matter has been adversely affecting Modi’s image. In order to send the right message, the   which talks of transparency should table the report.” 
 
 Vaghela even referred to the report on Patan gangrape and also the report of Snoopgate commission. The report of these two commissions , among others, are yet to be tabled, Vaghela said. 
 
 Patel replied saying that the Congress cannot talk of transparency as it was the party which had formed several commissions and wound them up later. Giving several examples, the deputy CM said that the Congress had formed 17 commissions and all of them were recalled. He further said that the BJP government was in the process of completing the formalities and, hence, the delay.
 
 The Speaker asked the government to complete all the formalities and table the report as soon as it can. He also said that the report once submitted was not the property of the house. The government has to submit an action taken report too.
 
 However, when the state government refused to give any specific time frame for tabling the report, Congress MLAs shouted anti-BJP slogans and even rushed to the well of the House. They sat on the floor of the House forcing the security staff to physically move them out of the House.
