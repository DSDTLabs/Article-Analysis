Looking Out From Within — Landscape and  ! This title itself tells one very much about the concept of Korean folk art by  . The exhibition, showcasing the artworks of the calligraphist and painter, will take one on a journey of life in her country. The colourful canvas has brought lively elements from art, nature, decoration and everyday life in Korea and also India. She says inspiration comes naturally whenever she spots any beautiful scenery around her. “I am familiar with the things and the landscape around my environment, so people can understand my works easily. Also, I combine realistic objects with my imagination,” says Soon-jin Park. 
Minhwa or Korean folk painting is an essential part of the country’s culture that the people use to convey their mythology, religion, and views on various topics. 
 “I studied my ancestors’ artworks and researched on their work for a long time. I also have had numerous exhibitions in my country. However, this exhibition is special to me because most of the works displayed here are inspired by the Indian culture, the colourful and rich life here, the beautiful temples and Indian attire like saris. I hope this exhibition will give many Indians an easy access to traditional Korean paintings through the familiar Indian colours,” she adds.
