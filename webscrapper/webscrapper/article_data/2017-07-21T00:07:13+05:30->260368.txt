Pune:   cooperatives and private dairies in the state have decided to approach chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to demand financial assistance to counter the continuous financial losses. 

 The decision was taken in a meeting conducted by directors of milk cooperatives and owners of private dairies on Thursday.
 
 Vinayak Patil, chairman of the Federation of the Milk Producers Association, said that the state government must give   to protect the interests of farmers and milk producers. The government has increased the milk purchase price by Rs 3. This has increased the per litre price from Rs 24 to Rs 27. “Milk dairies have been told not to increase the selling price. This is adversely affecting the business,” Patil said.
 
 Patil added that dairies were expecting a positive response from Fadnavis.The official, however, pointed out that a subsidy will not be a permanent solution. It can be scrapped after milk prices increase.
 
 According to milk dairies, Karnataka has already announced a subsidy of Rs 5 per litre to protect interests of farmers. The state government can initiate steps on similar lines, Patil said.
