NEW DELHI:  , who stepped down as captain of India’s   and   teams on Wednesday, supported successor   through tough times, even saving the Delhi batsman from the axe on many occasions. The revelation was made by   in an interview on Saturday.

 “He’ll always be the person who guided me initially and gave me opportunities. He gave me ample time and space to grow as a cricketer, saved me from getting dropped from the team many-a-time,” Kohli, who takes over as captain in all three formats, told  .tv .
 
 The 28-year-old, who has been leading the Test side for over two years now, added, “Obviously, these are massive shoes to fill. You think of MS Dhoni and the first word that comes to mind is ‘captain’! You don’t relate MS Dhoni in any other way. For me he is always going to be my captain.” Kohli insisted he will continue picking Dhoni’s brains.
 
 “On the field, obviously I would be running to him quite a lot... we would always have discussions and he would come to a conclusion. About the batting bit, if I ask him where he wants to bat, he would tell me ‘wherever you want me to bat’.
 
 “That is the kind of person he is. But I would love to see him bat higher up usually than what has been over the years. If he enjoys his cricket, the team is in a solid space. His ability, understanding of the game and situations is priceless.”
