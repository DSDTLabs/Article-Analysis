Tirumala: More than 50 cows were infected with Brucellosis at the Gosamrakshana Sala of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( ). Animals infected by the pathogenic bacteria have been segregated to prevent the spread of the disease. A separate shed has been built for these animals 30kms away from the temple town of Tirupati. 

 There are nearly 3,100 cows and bulls at the goshala. The milk used in all TTD temples is supplied from the same dairy farm. Out of the 30 Indian breeds, nearly 10-12 are seen in the same farm.
 
 Humans dealing with infected animals are likely to be attacked by Brucellosis. Besides, they can also be infected if they consume non-pasteurised milk or products made from the milk of infected animals. It may cause fever, spondylitis, muscular and joint pains in humans. 
 
 Director of the Gosamrakshana Sala K Harnatha Reddy said, “It is very difficult to detect the disease, it is possible only when the animals are pregnant. As a result of this the animal will suffer a miscarriage and lose their ability to reproduce.”
