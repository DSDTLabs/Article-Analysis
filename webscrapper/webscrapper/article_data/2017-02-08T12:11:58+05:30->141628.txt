CHENNAI: People who watched the sudden outburst of caretaker chief minister O   at Marina on Tuesday, started streaming in to his residence on Greenways Road all through the night to show their support.

 On Tuesday night, Panneerselvam made a rather dramatic announcement, standing by the memorial of late   leader J Jayalalithaa, that he was forced to resign from his post.
 
 "I am here in Chennai from Mumbai for a family get together. I saw   speak on television and came here to see him," said Maheshwari, as she carried her two-year-old boy to see her leader.
 
 Policemen, who tried to contain the excited crowd shouting slogans in praise of Panneerselvam, finally gave in and let them inside the leader's bungalow. OPS, meanwhile, was being visited by a few AIADMK leaders and former MLAs. 
 
 As the crowd in front of his bungalow showed no signs of thinning, Panneerselvam began stepping out of his front door every 30 minutes to greet them. Many supporters openly hailed OPS as the true follower of 'Amma'. 
 
 Police battalions kept marching in to the residence through the night as more people visited. Many people were seen taking selfies with OPS's car parked in front of his house and the bull in his backyard.
 
 "We do not know how serious the situation will become. We have been deputed here to keep the peace," said a policeman on duty. 
 
 As the night passed, OPS's personal security officers took turns trying to convince the crowd to leave telling them their leader was resting. But the mob showed no signs of leaving.
