 Law minister   told reporters on Wednesday that the government has sent the proposal to the advocate-general for his opinion on the objections raised by the governor. "We are yet to receive any information on the matter from the  ," he said. Governor Vajubhai R Vala had returned  , asking the government to reconsider its decision.
 
 Vala is said to have advised the government to analyze the merits and demerits of the candidate.

Hiremath had warned he would launch an agitation against the government's decision to appoint Shetty as Lokayukta.
