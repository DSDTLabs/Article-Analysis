ALLAHABAD: After the buzz early Friday about   health minister   saying that   would be built in   by 2019, the minister explained the context in which the statement was made.

 Talking to TOI on his statement that the temple would be built before Ardh Kumbh (January 2019), Singh said, “I made the statement referring to the prophecy of Swami Brahma Yogananda, who, after meeting (Narendra Modi) in Gujarat, had predicted that he will meet him next in Delhi when he will be the PM. Now, he has predicted that the temple would be constructed before Ardh Kumbh.“
 
 “I feel that the temple would be constructed, either by the court's order or by mutual consent. Those who had been opposing are now saying `Mandir wahin bana lo'. The circumstances are changing, as on triple talaq, and now we are seeing more changes and hence I said `Swamiji aap ki baat sahi ho jayegi' (Swamiji, your prediction will come true it seems).“
 
 Singh was at book launch of Singh was at book launch of `Sampoorna Bharat--Param Vaibhav Bharat' authored by Swami Brahma Yogananda.
