KANNUR: The workers of   (MARC), an   which focuses on rescuing wildlife in the urban areas, had a fulfilling experience two days ago as three turtles hatched out of the eggs they retrieved from a construction site in the city. The fact that the species, Indian Pond Terrapin, has figured in the   (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list of threatened species makes their effort relevant.

 “We got six eggs when the wall of a house at   in   town was being demolished four months ago and three have been hatched now and the remaining are all set to hatch,” said birdwatcher and researcher Roshnath Ramesh, who runs the NGO.
 
 “Though this turtle variety, also called Indian Black Turtles, is common in our state, their population is dwindling sharply as people kill them for their meat, even though it is a punishable offence like poaching a black buck,” Ramesh said, adding that the NGO was conserving these newlybred turtles with the consent of the forest department and they would be released into their natural habitat after the remaining eggs are also hatched.
 
 MARC, which mainly focuses on rescuing snakes, rescues around 200 snakes a month for which around 10 volunteers are working though they do not get any honorarium due to fund crunch, he said.
 
 “This happens mainly because their natural habitats like small shrubs are destroyed in the name of cleaning and development,” said the researcher, who added that the population of small wild animals like porcupine and civet is on the rise in urban areas, especially the peripheries. He said the rescued snakes should not be released to forests but to their natural habitats .
