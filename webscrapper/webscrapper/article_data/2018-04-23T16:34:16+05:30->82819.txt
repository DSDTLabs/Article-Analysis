After seven books, eight films and one Broadway play, author   said she is content with the way the story of 'Harry Potter' has turned out and she would not want to stretch the plot any further. 

  
  
 According to a report, the 52-year-old writer, who co-created   along with director   and playwright  , said the audience should not expect a sequel to the play as everything related to 'The Boy Who Lived' has been said and done.
 
 
 "I think we really have now told, in terms of moving the story forward, the story that I, in the back of my mind, wanted to tell," Rowling said before the day-long, multi-part 'Cursed Child' opened. 
 
 The plot focuses on the relationship Harry shares with his son,  . 
 
 The bestselling novelist added, "I think it's quite obvious, in the seventh book, in the epilogue, that Albus is the character I'm more interested in. And I think we've done the story justice. 
 
 "So I think pushing it on to Harry's grandchildren really would be quite a cynical move, and I'm not interested in doing that."
