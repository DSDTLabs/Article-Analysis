CHANDIGARH: First day of the   at   saw only 10 people coming to collect their unclaimed degrees. The degrees of the students, who had appeared in their examination as private candidates through correspondence at University School of Open Learning (USOL), were available on Day 1. On January 19, regular candidates will get their degrees. The oldest degree that was collected at the mela was of 1994. 

 Shashi, who works at a government school in Sector 41, had come along with her daughter to collect her BA degree from 1994. When asked why did not she collect her degree for all these years, she said, "I got a teaching job and since I had a BEd marksheet, I never felt the need to collect my degree. But when I came to know that the mela is being held, I decide to come." Her daughter is also a university student, who is pursuing MCom from USOL. 
 
 However, the confusion also prevailed as people who had their degrees with the departments also turned up on Day 1. They were told to come back on Thursday. Also, many parents came to collect the degrees of their children. However, they were told that the degrees will be given to the student only. 
 
 "Earlier, I did not require my degree since I was not working. Now that I have started working at a firm in Mohali, they want my graduation degree. So, I came to the university on Tuesday and came to know about this mela," said Ramandeep Kaur from Patiala, who had done her BA in 2008.
