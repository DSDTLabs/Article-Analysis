MUMBAI: The RBI has reserved the right to keep mum on the money it disbursed after demonetisation.   activist Anil Galgali had sought data on the count of notes given to each bank by the central bank. The RBI cited Section 8(1) (g) of the RTI Act, 2005, for its inability to share the data. The section bars “information”, “the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes”.

 Galgali has filed an appeal. “A large section of the public has withstood the demonetisation drive, stood for hours in queues only to be turned back by several banks,” he said. “How on earth are details of bank notes, now probably distributed among the public, going to “endanger” any person or “identify the source” of information?”
 
 He said the RBI did not employ scientific planning in disbursing new notes.
