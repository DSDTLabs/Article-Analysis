  Thomas made the remark when reporters asked what he thought about the widespread complaints that police were denying justice ‘even to a mother who lost her son’, in Kollam on Sunday. In his first appearance before media after his removal from the post of vigilance director, Thomas hinted that there wouldn’t be a comeback to the position.
 
  “Those who allege ‘vigilance raj’ are asking to ignore top-level corruption. Nepotism and budget leak, as per new definitions, do not amount to graft,” he said.
 
  Thomas added that he was currently staying away from the state capital. “Is it good to go back? We should be walking forward,” he said reacting to news reports that ruled out his comeback.
 
  Prevention of corruption and violence, he said, was everyone’s responsibility. “All should keep vigil to ensure that nobody is making illegal gains. Each and every one of us is responsible to prevent violence and atrocities,” he said. He also dismissed the rumours that he was being considered for a top position in the police department.
