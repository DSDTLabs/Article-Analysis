ISLAMABAD: The rape and murder of seven-year-old   in   district of Pakistan’s central Punjab earlier this month has brought the issue of sexual abuse of minor girls to the fore.

 Sexual abuse of minors has seldom been reported in conservative Pakistan. In most cases, the victims and their families prefer to remain silent about the crime. Their fear stems from the loopholes in the legal system wherein the complainants are bound to produce evidences and witnesses to prove the crime, a difficult lawful requirement for them to meet.
 
 However, scientific methods of investigation such as DNA and polygraph tests have proved a boon to the investigators. The DNA report ofImran  , who allegedly raped and murdered Zainab, proved that he had raped and murdered at least eight minors in Kasur in 2017.
 
 Ismat Shahjehan, a child rights activist, said the police earlier would not register rape cases and discourage families from filing reports. “This (Zainab) case helped bring child sexual exploitation to light in Pakistan and several cases have been registered after it,” she toldTOI, vowing to launch an awareness campaign across the country.
