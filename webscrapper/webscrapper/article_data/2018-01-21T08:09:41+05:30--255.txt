JAIPUR: The injustice meted out to Taiwanese tourist Wu-Wen-Chin who was given a two-tier berth in the luxury train Palace on Wheels (POW) despite having booked a twin-occupancy cabin was sorted out early on Saturday morning.

 Wu and  , a Chinese language expert, were among the last ones in their group to be allotted a cabin in one of the POW coaches. Admitting its mistake,   (RTDC) has decided to waive off their fare for the POW to compensate for the faux pas.
 
 Times of India had carried a report and pictures of Wu, in its January 20, 2018 edition, under the headline ‘Taiwanese tourists taken for a ride on POW’. TOI had revealed how a group from Taiwan was forced to put up in a regular AC 2-tier coach attached to the POW as the super luxury train was over-booked. The group, along with Yadav, had booked tickets for a four-day trip from Jaipur to Jodhpur via Chittorgarh, Udaipur and Jaisalmer.
 
 The authorities finally provided cabins to Chin and Yadav at around 4 am on Saturday morning.
 
 
 
 
 Jaipur: “The manager arrived at dawn and asked us to shift into a cabin. They apologised for not being able to arrange it earlier and also requested us not to speak to the media,’’ said Yadav.
 
 Wu was pleased with the development. “It’s an amazing experience. I am glad that the railway officials corrected their mistake,” Wu was quoted as saying to Yadav. “The railway officials assured us an extra coach when we were overbooked. The old POW coach was as good as the new one but lacked water and electricity. We have written to the railway authorities and will ensure that in future there is no overbooking,” said MD, RTDC, and tourism director Pradeep Borar.
