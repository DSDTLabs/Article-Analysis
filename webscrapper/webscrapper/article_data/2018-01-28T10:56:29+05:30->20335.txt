VISAKHAPATNAM:   students have emerged as the foremost violators of traffic rules in the city, with most of them being students of engineering colleges.

 This became known in a series of raids conducted by the Road Transport Authority ( ) from April 1 to December 31 last year at various junctions like RK Beach, Madhurawada, Maddilapalem, Gajuwaka, and NAD Kotha Road among other places where youngsters drive their vehicles at breakneck speeds while on their way to college and back.
 
 According to RTA authorities, a total of 1,432 driving licenses (DLs) were suspended in   district during this period. This number is double that of the DLs suspended in the corresponding period in 2016.
 
 When TOI analysed the suspensions of the DLs, it emerged that nearly 40% of the suspensions were of youth aged between 18 and 30, with women accounting only for 1% of the total cases. Of the total DLs seized from youths, 90% are college goers. 
 
 “Nearly 90% of the youth whose DLs were suspended are college students,” said S Venkateswara  , deputy transport commissioner of Visakhapatnam RTA.
 
 Rao said none of the college managements in the district has voluntarily come forward to seek the department’s help in conducting orientation programmes for their students.
 
 “Even when our department takes an initiative, some college managements are reluctant to accept our free service,” Rao opined.
 
 “Prior to this drive in 2017, we used to suspend the licenses of those who were only involved in drunk driving and accidents, but now we are doing it for all offences, in a bid to improve driving manners of the public,” another RTA officer said.
