The mercury might be rising over the week since the dust storms subsided but it hasn’t sapped Gurugrammers’ energy. The city was out in big numbers to participate in what was billed as New Gurgaon’s first half-marathon. While Gurgaon has seen countless runs and  s over the last few years,   – the area along   near   Expressway comprising of Sectors 82 through 95 – hasn’t had such luck. Shirish, a resident of Sector 83, said, “We always felt like the poor cousin of the main city because they host so many of these events, but we didn’t have any. Ab Gurgaon ka fitness culture yahan bhi aa gaya hai.”

  
  Running like a diva!
 
  The race, which saw over a thousand runners participate across three categories – half-marathon, 10K run, and 5K run – was flagged off at 5.30am near   in Sector 82. Enthusiastic runners had started gathering at the start line as early as 4.30am. While several of Gurgaon’s regular runners and running groups participated, the race was a special occasion for the residents of New Gurgaon. “This is the first race here and it means we do not have to travel to Golf Course Road or Leisure Valley to take part in a half-marathon,” said a runner.
