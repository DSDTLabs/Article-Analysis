HYDERABAD: A day after chief minister   announced seven zones and two multi-zones for recruitment and transfer of government employees, the Joint Action Committee ( ) of   employees, gazetted officers and teachers on Friday suggested modifica tions, claiming there were anomalies in the zonal system. 

 
  JAC leaders, including chairman K Ravinder Reddy, secretary general Mamata, MLA V Srinivas Goud and MLC G Devi Prasad met to discuss changes that need to be made in the present zonal system. "In Group I and other state cadre posts, there are no reservations for locals. In direct recruitment, there should be 85% quota for locals and 15% for non-locals," Ravinder said. 
 
 He suggested that to provide more opportunities to unemployed youth, all state cadre posts should be demarcated as multi-zonal except posts of heads of the department and secretariat and some state cadre posts. Leaders said there should be provisions for transfers from district to heads of the dept and secretariat cadre should be in fair share of zonal concentration and vice-versa.
 
  The unions also discussed the present zonal areas and asked the government to make changes. One change proposed was the addition of Medchal, Malkajgiri, Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy to Charminar zone, but JAC suggested that Vikarabad be brought under the zone also. They wanted a new Ranga Reddy district, with more of erstwhile Mahbubnagar district areas, to be shifted to Jogulamba zone to balance population. Other suggestions were made for Bhadradri and Yadadri zones. 
 
 "JAC also passed a resolution thanking the CM for dividing the state into seven zones and two multi-zones," Srinivas Goud, honorary president of Telangana Gazetted Officers' Association also, said.
