LUCKNOW: Director general of police (DGP)   on Friday sent out a missive to   of all 75 districts in the state asking the SPs to identify and reward the best performing policeman of the month.

 The move is aimed at boosting the morale of non-gazetted policemen. Women police station, GRP and other police units have also been asked to emulate the model.
 
 Police chiefs would call for entries through SHOs posted under them and decide who is to be awarded. “I just hope the person who actually works on the ground is rewarded without bias,” said a constable posted in trans-Gomti area.
 
 Meanwhile, in a meeting held at DGP headquarters on Friday, discussions over arrangements to be made for investors’ summit were held between senior police officials.
 
 Important points of the meeting were shared by SSP Lucknow in the evening so that a final plan could be laid out for the summit. Security of VVIPs is a major concern, besides earmarking parking space for vehicles of dignitaries.
