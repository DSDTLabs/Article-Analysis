JAIPUR: The state   is seeking   from the Central government for providing   and uniforms to 65 lakh students enrolled in government schools of Rajasthan from academic session 2017-18. The Centre is already providing funds for the purpose to some states under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Sources also said these bags will bear the picture of chief minister  . The state will bear 40% of the cost incurred on bags and uniforms while 60% of the amount will be funded by the Central government.

 The move is not only being seen as a populist measure but also to build pressure on private schools. Sources say that once the Centre accedes to state government’s demand, the state would ask the private schools to provide uniforms and bags to students admitted under the RTE quota. At present, private schools in Rajasthan only give admission. They are paid a reimbursement of Rs 17,500 per child which includes Rs 700 as book allowance and the rest is tuition fees. 
 
 Education minister Vasudev Devnani has expressed the need for providing free books and uniforms to HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. 
 
 Riding on the crest of increase in enrolments in government schools this year after a gap of five years, the state is leaving no chance to keep the momentum. The state education department is looking for funds to bring about a change in school uniforms from the coming session. Asking parents to bear the expenses of uniform may create a controversy, which is another reason why the state government plans to provide them free of cost. 
 
 A rough estimate says that a budget of Rs 300 crores for 30 lakh metres of cloth will be required. 
 
 The state is already providing books for free. “This whole exercise would increase the happiness index of people in Rajasthan,” an education official said.
