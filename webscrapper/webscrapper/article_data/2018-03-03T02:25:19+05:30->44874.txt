NAVI MUMBAI:   have registered a kidnapping case after a 14-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped by four youths in a van, when she was accompanied by her younger brother. They were walking on the street near their building in Sector 16, Sanpada around 6pm. 

 However, the girl was traced after two hours as she returned home on her own after calling her father from a medical store. A mob later gathered at   and staged a rasta roko. "The kidnapped girl's younger brother accompanying her told the police that four youngsters in a white-coloured van forcibly dragged her inside the van and sped away. The four had colours spread across their face," said denior inspector Suraj Padvi said.
 
 Cops have learnt the van's registration number. "As the girl returned on her own, there is a possibility that she knew the youths and might have gone with them on her own volition," a crime branch source said.
