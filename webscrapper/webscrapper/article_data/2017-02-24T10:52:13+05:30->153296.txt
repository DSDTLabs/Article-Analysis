KOLKATA: The light drizzle during the wee hours of Thursday may help mercury dip one or two degrees, said the Met office. Alipore recorded a rainfall of 0.2 mm on Thursday morning. 

 "Nights will be pleasant and the temperature could drop three degrees before it again starts rising by Sunday. For this year, winter has left the city and will not return," said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, deputy director general (meteorology) at Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) Kolkata.
 
 Thursday's temperature was 31.2 degrees Celsius, which was only a notch above the normal. But the minimum temperature at 24.8 degrees was seven degrees higher than the normal mark. According to the Met, moisture from the sea by south-westerly wind had pushed up the mercury.
 
 The Met office has been keeping track of a trough line for the past few days. Due to the trough extending from the sub-Himalayan region in   to north coastal Odisha, moist-laden south-westerly wind from   has been blowing into the land uninterrupted. In addition to pushing up the humidity level, it also pushed up cloud formation. That is how the weather was increasingly becoming unpleasant at nights.
 
  The Met office believes that that the south-westerly's impact will get weakened in next few days.
