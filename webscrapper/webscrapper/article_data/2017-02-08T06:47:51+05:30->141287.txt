PUNE: A sessions court here on Tuesday set aside the criminal process directed in August last year by a magisterial court against National Congress Party’s Rajya Sabha member Vandana Chavan and her sister-in-law in an alleged  .

 The case was filed in October 2014 by Chavan’s neighbour Vijay Navdikar. He alleged that the duo attacked two of his male cats with wooden sticks and an iron rod, leaving them maimed and crawling. 
 
 Chavan and her sister-in-law,  , had moved a revision plea against the magistrate’s order. Their lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar had argued, among other things, that Navdikar lodged the complaint out of vengeance because the Chavans had lodged cases and chapter proceedings besides securing a special magistrate’s directive for getting the pets removed from the premises.
 
 He argued that the magistrate’s impugned (under challenge) order was bad in law because there was no prima facie evidence for offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The order was based on a medical certificate related to the cats’ health and it had no relevance with the incident, he submitted and argued that Navdikar did not produce any injury certificate.
 
 “The court of additional sessions judge S J Kale allowed our revision plea and set aside the process while directing discharge of Chavan and her sister-in-law,” Nimbalkar told TOI. 
 
 The   MP has already issued a legal notice to Navdikar for a Rs5 crore defamation case. “Navdikar has not replied to the notice so far. We will decide on registering the case soon,” Nimbalkar said.
