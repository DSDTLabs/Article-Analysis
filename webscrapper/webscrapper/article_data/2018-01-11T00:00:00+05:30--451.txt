For most likely the first time ever,   across the state are seeing standees of   in   draped in garlands of flowers and money, even before the team has announced the   date. The film is yet to be sent the censor board (it is likely to release in the first week of February), but the excitement among fans is such that there is nothing short of a frenzy.

 Producer Sreekanth KP tells us that this is not part of the promotions, but something that the fans are doing themselves. “Fans are garlanding the standees by themselves after hearing the songs and watching stills from the films. This can be seen in theatres across the state — all the way from Bidar to Mysuru, and Bengaluru. I think that this is the first time that such a thing is happening in multiplexes anywhere in the country.” The state certainly seems to be gripped by the Tagaru fever.
