When debutant director Selvakannan decided to make  , he wasn’t concentrating on making it a commercially profitable venture. His sole focus was on narrating an impactful story, which will win the appreciation of critics and audience alike.

 The director says, “There have been many films in the industry that spoke at length about the relationship between a mother and her child and a father and his child. But, not many have delved into the bond a grandchild shares with his/her grandparents. My film revolves around a 70-year-old man (played by Poo Ramu) and his grandson.”
 
 While the film mostly stars newcomers,   has roped in Kaviperarasu   to pen the lyrics. “Vairamuthu sir and editor   are the only two celebrities in the film,” he laughs, “I’ve assisted Vairamuthu sir in his office and have known him for a long time. He didn’t charge us a penny for writing the lyrics. One of the songs he has written for us — Karuvatheva Un Kannellam Kanneera — will be a highlight; he was inspired by his own grandfather while penning it.”
 
 The film is set against the backdrop of  , and interestingly, has been produced by 50 of his friends from college. “It’s been more than 17 years since we all studied together in Tirunelveli, but we make it a point to meet every year. We’ve always wanted to do something to make our polytechnic college proud. So, we decided to make a film on human emotions and showcase our town in a new light. Though many films have been based in Tirunelveli, we felt none portrayed its true essence. So, my friends funded this venture. This is a festival film and I’m hopeful of it bagging a National Award,” Selva signs off on an optimistic note.
