Lucknow : Authorities at   issued two advisories pouring cold water on the plans of students wanting to celebrate Valentine's Day on campus. The university felt the second, milder advisory was necessary because the first one got them trolled on social media as it explicitly said it didn't want students to celebrate Valentine's Day because it was "Western culture". 

  first notified a holiday on Wednesday, February 14, on account of "Mahashivaratri", making the campus out of bounds for students, threatened them with disciplinary action and even appealed to parents and guardians to ensure that their wards don't come to campus.
 
  "In recent years, we have observed that students, influenced by Western culture, celebrate Valentine's Day on February 14. Students enrolled in the university are notified that the campus is closed on February 14, 2018, for 'Mahashivaratri'," reads the February 10 advisory issued by the proctor, Prof Vinod Singh. 
 
  Roasted on social media for the advisory, LU on the eve of V-Day issued a second one. The fresh circular, dated February 13, stated that since the university was closed on account of Mahashivaratri, no teaching would take place on February 14. Students found roaming about the campus would be punished, read the revised order. TOI has copies of both circulars. 
 
 When questioned about the need for two circulars, LU vice-chancellor   said, "The language used by the proctor in his first advisory was 'incorrect', but his intentions were right. In his excitement to perform duties diligently, he (proctor) issued the notice (stating Western culture). The proctor's choice of words was wrong, and so we issued a fresh one.''
 
  The advisory states that classes would remain suspended, and that no extra classes or practical exams would take place on the day. Valentine's Day customs, like exchanging flowers and chocolates, were banned on the LU campus last year too.
