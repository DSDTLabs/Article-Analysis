Amritsar: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Amritsar district administration have geared up to receive Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his family members and cabinet colleagues on Wednesday.

 Heavy security arrangements have been made in the Holy city. Security has been put on a high state of alert in adjoining districts and Punjab’s borders with Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan as well as the international border with Pakistan.
 
 According to official programme, Trudeau will arrive at the Golden Temple at 11 am and after paying obeisance there, he would visit the Partition Museum and head for meeting with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh at the Taj hotel.
 
 Media adviser to the Punjab CM, Raveen Thukral, informed TOI on Tuesday that Amarinder would neither receive Trudeau at the airport nor he would accompany him to the Golden Temple but he would meet him at the hotel.
 
 Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said he, along with Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, Amritsar MP Gurjijt Singh Aujla, mayor of Amritsar Karamjit Singh Rintu, deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha and police commissioner S S Srivastava will receive and see off Trudeau.
 
 SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said they had made all preparations to receive Trudeau and had assigned duties to its staff for his smooth reception and stay at the Golden Temple. However, he claimed that the SGPC had ensured that there was no inconvenience to other devotees during Trudeau’s visit.
 
 The district administration officials also briefed Trudeau’s security team about the security arrangements. SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh said the SGPC’s task force and security officials rehearsed for Trudeau’s reception on Tuesday.
