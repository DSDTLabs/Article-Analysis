PATNA: All political parties may be supporting the prohibition in state, but they are not very keen to join the   planned by the   on January 21 to create awareness about the benefits of liquor ban.

 Former deputy CM and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said they have not received any invite in this regard though the government has sent letters to the schools and district magistrates asking them to ensure maximum participation in the event. “Bihar government has not written any letter to us. CM Nitish Kumar is the head of the government and he should write a letter to all the parties and take them into confidence,” said Modi, adding that the government should call for an all-party meeting if it wanted everyone’s support. 
 
 He further said his party was in support of the prohibition, baring a few legal provisions which were draconian. When asked if his party members would join the human chain, he replied, “We will think after receiving any letter or information from the government side.”
 
 On the other hand, ruling JD(U) state president   refrained from commenting on extending any invitation to the political parties. “It depends on them whether they will join the move or not,” Singh said. He further said, “This will be the largest human chain formed ever and it is being done for a social cause and not for a protest or power. This is not being organized by any party either. It depends on the BJP whether they participate or not. Everyone present in the Vidhan Sabha, irrespective of political affiliations, supported prohibition.”
