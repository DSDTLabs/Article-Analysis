DEHRADUN: In a crackdown on unaccounted money, Enforcement directorate sleuths raided three premises of “illegal” foreign currency changer   and seized Rs 68 lakh in foreign and Indian currencies here on Tuesday evening.
 
  Acting on a tip-off, three ED teams raided at Gaurav’s two business premises — located in the heart of the city on Nashville road and near St Joseph school — and his palatial house near Mussoorie diversion road.
  
  “The raids are still going on at all three places, but as of now Rs 68 lakh — Rs 17 lakh foreign currencies and Rs 51 lakh Indian currency— have been seized,” a senior ED official told TOI on condition of anonymity.
  
  ED teams have also seized several documents, which establish their links both in   and other states.
  
  “Gaurav and his father   run a foreign currency exchange business for the past ten years, and the duo has links with a syndicate supplying unaccounted foreign currencies of different countries such as the US, Canada, Dubai and Singapore,” said the ED official.
  
  Divulging details of the investigation carried out so far, the official said the duo was under the ED scanner, and their names had figured in discreet inquiries. “They are well-known foreign currency exchange dealers in and outside Dehradun, and are operating without licence. They used to exchange foreign currency at lower rates to people,” he said.
  
  “We are yet to find the source of foreign and Indian currencies. It appears that the suspects are part of Dehradun and western Uttar Pradesh syndicates, otherwise such high volume of foreign and India currency exchange operation is not possible,” said the official, adding that Rs 51 lakh Indian currency was to be used for exchanging more foreign currencies.
  
  After raids, the ED has decided to register a case under the Prevention of   Act against the duo.
