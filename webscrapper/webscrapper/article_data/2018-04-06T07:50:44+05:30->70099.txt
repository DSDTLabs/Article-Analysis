LUDHIANA: A city-based RTI activist has filed a complaint with the building branch officials of MC against the alleged corrupt practices of assistant town planner (ATP) of zone C   for not taking any action against the non-compoundable constructions in the area. The complaint has been forwarded to the principal secretary and director of local bodies department for action.

 Following the complaint, a checking was conducted and 12 buildings were found to be under construction on   (between   to  ). 
 
 The activist alleged that Mangat is not taking action against the violators, even when the buildings are being constructed illegally, reasons of which are best known to him. He demanded that vigilance inquiry over the aforesaid matter should be marked and composition fee of the buildings in question be assessed and recovered, so that no loss is caused to the public exchequer. He said the non-compoundable portion of the buildings in question should be demolished as per the procedure provided in the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.
 
 Meanwhile, ATP (headquarter) S S Bindra has also issued a letter to Mangat and the concerned building inspector asking them to give explanation regarding the ongoing construction work of these 12 buildings. They have been asked to explain why they did not take action against the violators, by April 8. In case, they failed to reply to the notice, it will be considered that the buildings were being constructed with their connivance and suitable action will be recommended against them.
 
 However, Mangat has refuted the allegations by saying that the building inspectors have the powers to check the buildings and issue challans or even demolish them. But, he did not receive any report from the building inspector regarding these 12 buildings, he said.
