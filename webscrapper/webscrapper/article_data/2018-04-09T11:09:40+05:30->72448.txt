MUMBAI: Was Lord Commander not in right condition to run when he lost as a favourite as claimed by jockey  ? Did the stewards of the   (RWITC) err in suspending Chouhan for a year for not allowing the horse to run on its merit?

 
 As the questions swirled at the  , chairman of stewards Geoffrey   cleared the air on Sunday.
 
 "We did not make any mistake in suspending Chouhan and we firmly believe Lord Commander was fit to race," Nagpal told TOI.
 
 Lord Commander was the favourite to win the Quest For Cash Plate on March 15. The odds on him went up gradually before the race suggesting he was not likely to win. The gelding eventually finished fourth behind ownermate and winner Fine Tune which led to the accusations of malpractice. Incidentally, Fine Tune attracted heavy bets.
 
 The stewards initiated an inquiry against Chouhan for professional misconduct. In the inquiry, the jockey brought to the notice of the stewards that Lord Commander had bled while training four days before the race and the club vet had advised rest for the horse. But the stewards didn't consider that and instead held Chouhan guilty.
 
 "Lord Commander's bleeding during the work was classified as Category 2 by our vet and as per the club's rules laid down in calendar notification, Cat 1 and 2 bleeding doesn't affect a horse's performance during the race. That's why we don't believe the gelding was not fit to run," said Nagpal.
 
 Nagpal revealed that stewards strongly believed Chouhan had deliberately underperformed and that he needed to be punished for it. "Chouhan claimed the pace of the race was too much for his mount but we drew his attention to Lord Commander's running in his first race of the season where he ran with better timings over the same distance," said Nagpal.
 
 Nagpal, who took over the reins of the stewards body just at the start of the season, has certainly rubbed a few people the wrong way with this strong decision.
 
 "I don't care," said Nagpal. "I have enjoyed a clean reputation in my 40 years of association with racing and I intend to keep doing my work honestly."
