MUMBAI: It's a simple truth that all travellers know of. The best time to travel to a destination is never the best time to get a cheap deal, especially in hotel room tariff. But with information and planning, there are ways to get around these limitations. A study by an online travel portal found out that some destinations offer significant hotel value this year as compared to the last and these include those in the Turkey , Taiwan, Belize,   and Cambodia.

 Apart from comparing the hotel room tariffs on offer this year and the last, the study also looked at the best time to visit countries while taking into account the climate and hotel rates.The hotel room tariffs in most countries in the West were the cheapest, but the temperatures too were very low, which didn't make it an ideal time to visit.
 
 “While the most affordable month to stay in a hotel in the US was in January (Rs 13,175), other months like May (Rs 16,692), June (Rs 18,163), and September (Rs 17,801) are the best time to visit, boasting an optimal combination of price and temperature,“ said the study by TripAdvisor. 
 
 The least expensive hotel rates in Spain were in January (Rs 8,347), however, travellers would be able to enjoy low prices and better weather in March (Rs 9,823), April (Rs 11,531) and November (Rs 10,044). As for the UK, visitors could get affordable rates and mild temperatures in May (Rs 16,517), August (Rs 14,720) and October (Rs 14,601). For Japan, travellers would find April (Rs 18,334), May (Rs 14,228), and June (Rs 13,264) offer the best combination of warm temperatures and low rates and for Italy travel during April (Rs 15,747), October (Rs 14,999), or November (Rs 14,999) would be recommended for the best mix of price and weather. Then for travel to Thailand, which perennially has high temperatures, travellers can get low hotel room tariffs in April (Rs 7,317), May (Rs 7,177), and June (Rs 7,342).
