VADODARA: The   (VMC) that is eyeing to provide   has begun trial smart poles that will be installed in the city. The civic body is looking to provide   and   for a limited period.

 The   will provide Wi-Fi at prominent locations in the city to citizens amongst other services. The poles installed will have digital signboards, public address system, sensors for weather and traffic and other facilities. Telecom service providers will be given space on the poles for setting up their equipment. The city needed at least 300 more cell sites and the poles that would be aesthetically appealing could be used for the purpose.
 
 The vendor taking up the project will be able to generate revenue through advertising on the poles, rentals from telecom service providers and charges for Wi-Fi after the limit of free usage expires. The vendor will also pay an amount to the civic body thus generating some revenue for VMC.
 
 On a trial basis, two such poles were erected opposite the Kamatibaug and in Alkapuri opposite the platform six of the railway station. Sources said that the suitability of the poles was being looked into both aesthetically and technically. According to officials, these poles were also of smaller heights. Poles of much larger heights were also to be installed as a part of the project.
