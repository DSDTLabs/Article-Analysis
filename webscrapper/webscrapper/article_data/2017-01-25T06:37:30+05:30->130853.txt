BENGALURU: Regularizing and increasing parking charges may be the lynchpin of the threefold plan chalked out by traffic police to reduce congestion. But the plan is set for failure even before it kicks off as   owned or operated by  , whose co-operation traffic police were banking upon for implemention, are in utter chaos.

 Records reveal no tenders have been called for regularizing parking at these parking lots and off-road parking bays for over three years. In fact, BBMP itself is unclear about who is running its parking lots.
 
 BBMP documents show that the tender for parking spaces at KR Market, Rajajinagar shopping complex, Yeshwantpur shopping complex, multilevel parking lot in   and Jayanagar shopping complex expired in March 2014.
 
 “No fresh tenders have been issued. Lower level officers are either following old tenders or have made some arrangements. BBMP is losing revenue and we suspect malpractices. Not calling for tenders has resulted in loss of at least Rs 10 crore,” said MK Gunashekar, chairman taxation and finance committee, BBMP.
 
 An inspection of parking lots on Tuesday revealed that even in the absence of valid tenders, parking charges were being collected in BBMP’s name. The spaces were also being used for maintenance of vehicles, storage of discarded vehicles and dumping of garbage.
 
 The revelations have come to light at a time when BBMP is studying Delhi’s private-public partnership parking model, which benefits private property owners. “We don’t have land in the central business district (CBD), so we can look at partnering with private property owners. They will get large concessions in property tax and leniency in floor area ratio, apart from the revenue they earn from parking fees,” said a senior BBMP official.
 
 Tuesday’s inspection covered parking lots in KR Market, JC Road and BBMP shopping complexes at Rajajinagar, Yeshwantpur and Jayanagar.
