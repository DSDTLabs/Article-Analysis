Once I came to know that Radhika Vemula is suffering [from] paralysis, I met her. At that time, I was privately informed by Anjali Devi, that Radhika did not belong to   , but was from the community of scheduled caste."

 Through the letter he also expressed shock over social justice minister T S Ghelot`s comment about Radhika's caste. He had claimed that she belonged to the Vaddera community.
 
 “I strongly affirm that she belongs to the SC community and her children also get the same caste because they were brought up by her, without any support from my family or my son (Mani Kumar). Therefore our caste cannot be attributed to her or her children,“ the letter stated.
