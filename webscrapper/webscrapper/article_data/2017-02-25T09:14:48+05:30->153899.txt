MUMBAI: The BJP could have emerged the single largest party in the BMC polls had it not been for the four seats they lost by wafer-thin margins.

 The BJP won 82 seats in the civic elections while former ally Shiv Sena tallied 84 seats.   president   tweeted ruing that four of their candidates had lost by very little margins.
 
 He didn't mention that a BJP candidate in Mumbadevi proved to be the luckiest on Thursday when he won after a draw of lots by a four-yearold girl. His Shiv Sena rival had polled the exact same number of votes.
 
 Mahesh Parkar, the former law committee chair man in the BMC, lost to Sena candidate Vishwanath Mahadeshwar in ward number 87 by 34 votes. Fate proved harsher to BJP candidate Kamla Raj Purohit, who lost ward 4 in Magathane by only 17 votes to Sena candidate Sujatha Patekar. BJP candidate   lost to Congress candidate   in   by 48 votes and the party's Jaisal Kothari lost to Sena's Amey Ghole in Wadala by 84 votes.
 
 A chartered accountant by profession, Kelkar, 49, was contesting for the first time in the BMC elections. “I have been working with the BJP for a long time now and understand the nuances of elections. I feel that somewhere my political calculations did not work out owing to which I lost the elections,“ he said.
 
 Kelkar confessed that he got a chance to contest as the BJP and Sena split. “For the last two decades, Sena candidates have been dominating this portion of Vile Parle. However, the citizens are fed up of the Shiv Sena and therefore were looking for a change.That I lost to a Congress candidate is a clear indication that the area had enough of the Sena,“ said Kelkar.
