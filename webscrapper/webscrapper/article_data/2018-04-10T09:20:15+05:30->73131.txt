LUCKNOW: The family of   woman, who has accused   MLA   of rape, had sent a hand-written letter to the Yogi government, anticipating murder attempt on the survivor's jailed father. He died at district hospital on Monday after he was shifted under critical condition following April 3 brawl with Senger's brother and his aides. 

 "After a fabricated charge, my son has been arrested and sent to jail in a comatose condition. I feel that my family will now be killed by   (BJP MLA), and his aides Atul Singh and Arun Singh. It is utmost urgent that the police takes legal action against these men," Singh's mother wrote on Sunday.
 
 
  
  
 
 The hand-written letter, in blue ink, was sent to the CM's office.
 
 In her letter, the lady also described in details how her son was allegedly beaten while her daughter-in-law and granddaughter, refusing to withdraw the   against the legislator, were threatened.
 
 "They were putting pressure on us to withdraw the rape case. On April 3, the MLA's brother Kuldip Singh 6 others barged into our home. They first dragged my son and tied him to a tree and kept thrashing him," the letter said. She has also alleged that several other criminal cases were slapped on the behest of legislator's family.
 
 Speaking to TOI over the phone, the rape survivor and her younger sister said that the letter was an evidence that Unnao police refused to act on the family's apprehensions on killing
 
 "While I was given two armed women cops to escort me from Lucknow after I tried to immolate myself outside CM residence, nobody heard my family's pleas on attempt to eliminate them. What more proof do they want to book the MLA and his man now my father is gone," said the survivor.
