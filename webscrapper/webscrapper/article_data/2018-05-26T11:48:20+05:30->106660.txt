CHANDIGARH: As the central government has denied providing extra funds to the   administration, the   will now have to figure out a way to increase its revenue stream on its own. In the absence of Centre’s extra funds, the Chandigarh administration will not be in a position to aid the MC as it has its own expenses to manage.

 Meanwhile, sources in the   department of the UT administration said that the department may ask for more funds in September from the central government and if the Centre agrees, the MC may get something.
 
 “We asked for additional money for the municipal corporation a few months ago, but the central government outrightly refused for the same. Not only Chandigarh, the central government has asked all the MCs across the nation to make efforts in generating their own revenue, instead of asking for money. We have already conveyed the same to the MC,” said an MC official.
