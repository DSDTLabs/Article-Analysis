CHHAPRA: State   on Saturday slammed the   for   in the state. “Crime graph in the state has gone up and no one is bothered. People in power are more interested in making money,” Rai said while talking to mediapersons at the BJP office here.
 
  “People of Saran are living under fear due to number of killings by criminals,” he added. Asked to comment on crisis within the Grand Alliance following CBI raids on Lalu and his kin, Rai said it is unfortunate that people in power have amassed ‘benami’ properties. “Deputy CM   has claimed that he was minor when Lalu did all transactions as railway minister. However, when   and Sarala Gupta transferred their land to Tejashwi, he was not a minor. Lalu and his family members should accept their wrongdoings and stop criticising BJP or CBI for the raids,” Rai said.
  
  He suggested CM Nitish Kumar to break his silence on corruption charges against Tejashwi and severe ties with RJD.
  
  Asked about BJP’s stand in the event of fall of Grand Alliance government, Rai said, “The party high command has been watching the development. A final decision would be taken only by the BJP brass.”
