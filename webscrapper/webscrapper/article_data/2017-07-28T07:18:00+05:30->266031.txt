GURUGRAM: Around 200 parents from   School, Sohna road, held a   against the school authorities on Thursday for not visiting the 15-year-old school boy in hospital, who allegedly attempted suicide two weeks ago after jumping off the school building.

 Scores of parents took to the streets near Subash Chowk, protesting against what they called as the school authorities’ apathy. “So many days have passed and yet not a single person from the school visited my son,” said  , the father of Mohit, who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital and in a vegetative state.
 
 On July 4, Class IX student Mohit, a resident of Islampur village in Sohna, allegedly jumped off the roof of the building’s top floor while on his way to class. Following the incident, the boy was taken to   hospital. He suffered multiple fractures and other internal injuries.
 
 Mohit’s father, Vijender, told TOI that he suspected that his son was tortured before he jumped off. “If anyone wants to commit suicide, why would he take off shoes and ID card and put his bag aside before jumping off the building. His ID card is missing ever since,” he said.
 
 Yashpal Yadav, the school principal, has expressed his surprise in the manner in which Mohit’s father spoke. “I am really surprised. If he indeed said such words, it is his own view because we are in regular contact with the hospital and the family of the injured boy. We inquire about his condition on a daily basis. It is incorrect to say that we don’t care,” said Yadav. 
 
 When asked if anyone from the school visited the child in hospital, Yadav dodged the question saying the school was in regular touch with the hospital authorities. Regarding questions as to the circumstances in which the boy allegedly attempted suicide, he said, “The issue is in court and police are also investigating. I would not want to comment on the issue.”
 
 Vijender however, disputed the principal’s version saying he never called him or any member of his family.
