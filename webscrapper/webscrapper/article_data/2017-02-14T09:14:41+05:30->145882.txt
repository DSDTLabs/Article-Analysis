 In order to make the initiative bigger, HAND has invited all citizens this Valentine’s Day to come and and help them revamp the Nashik Road railway station. 
 
 Looking at the unclean condition of the railway station, young volunteers of the NGO decided to celebrate Valentine’s Day, but with a difference. ‘I Love Nashik’ is the first campaign they are launching on February 14. Starting with the Nashik Road Railway Station, the group will move on to different locations gradually. 
 
 A volunteer, Neha Sharma said, “This event is about expressing our love and pride for the city. We have chosen the Nashik Road Railway Station as a platform for this event because this space is one of the first glimpses a that visitor gets while travelling. So, we urge everyone to create graffiti on the walls of the station and platform while expressing their love for the city. Let us create a unique identity for our station too.”
