Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) is still in a dilemma over fixing the price of each square yard of the LIG (Low Income Groups) and EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) plots in its joint venture layout titled ‘Fortune Hills’ in Dakamarri. 

 Though the state government declared the reservation percentage for these plots about three months ago, Vuda has been unable to proceed further due to the uncertainty over land prices.
 
 Earlier in 2016, Vuda fixed a price of Rs 6,000 a square yard for LIG and EWS plots. Due to the surge in land price, it may not be technically possible to register the lands for the successful applicants of LIG and EWS plots at Rs 6,000 a square yard any longer as the minimum price in the area has now shot up to Rs 9,000. Vuda is also apprehensive of fixing the land price at Rs 9,000 a square yard when householders having an annual income of up to Rs 3,00,000 only are eligible for purchasing the EWS category plots.
 
 Vuda had earlier auctioned the HIG and MIG plots in the same layout in 2016. Even though the upset price was fixed at Rs 10,000 per square yard in Dakamarri layout auction, some plots were purchased at prices as high as Rs 16,500 per square yard. Now, lottery will be conducted for the EWS and LIG plots and Vuda will soon issue a notification inviting applications from the public.
