MUMBAI: A   at   was allegedly assaulted by the mother of a toddler on Wednesday after she tried to intervene in an altercation between the woman and the childâ€™s grandmother, prompting the stir by the doctors to intensify.

 The incident took place last night when the woman doctor tried to intervene in the scuffle between the mother and the grandmother of the child.
 
  An FIR has been registered against three women in this regard by the police.
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, the doctors continue to abstain from work across major civic hospitals in Mumbai with thousands of patients have been left to suffer and go through a lot of inconvenience at public hospitals as surgeries have been cancelled and patients are being turned away from Out Patient Departments (OPD).
 
 The doctors are on strike due to the recent incidents of violence against them.
 
  This protest comes in the wake of attack on one of the doctors by a patient's relatives earlier on Saturday.
