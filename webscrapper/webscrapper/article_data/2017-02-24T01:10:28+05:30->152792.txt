NAVI MUMBAI: The citizens’ fight against untreated chemical   being released into the creeks continues across all parts of the city. The residents of  , Kalamboli and Taloja have started an   campaign about the problems due to alleged discharge of untreated effluents since last week. 

 The online petition—addressed to MPCB, ministry of environment and various other government organizations—already acquired over 900 signatures till Tuesday evening.
 
 Residents are also using the social media to garner as many signatures as possible. Many locals have complained that they fall sick due to constant exposure to the toxic fumes. 
 
 “My son is suffering from cough for the past six months. We are hoping that authorities take note of the petition,” said Smita Beohar, resident of Valencia CHS, sector 16, Roadpali.
 
 The locals said that a similar initiative was undertaken two years back. A committee comprising of seven members with representatives from each of the effected node as well as   (MPCB) officials, headed by an IAS officer, was also formed but nothing conclusive came of it. 
 
 “The committee was a halfhearted attempt, as it ceased to exist after the chairman was transferred. They did not even file a report. We can only hope that the online petition forces the authorities to act,” said another resident, Panduranga Vittal.
