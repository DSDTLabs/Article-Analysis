When Ranjan Pramod’s   movie Photographer released in 2006, Mollywood was thrilled to welcome a new, talented child actor with an interesting background, to the industry. 

 Master Mani, who hails from the tribal colony in Wayanad, even went on to bag the State Award for the Best Child Actor, for his performance in the movie.
 Mani didn’t pursue a career in movies but his real life journey, from dropping out of school to getting married and fathering a kid at a tender age often became fodder for news. The youngster is now all set to be relaunched in the industry through the upcoming movie Udalaazham. The film is directed by Unnikrishnan Avala, who has also scripted it.
 
 “It’s the story of a tribal boy, who finds it tough to accept his body and understand whether he is actually male or female. Moreover, as he isn’t educated, he is confused and doesn’t know much about the concept of transgenders either. Udalazham is the tale of such a young man,” says a source close to the film.
 The movie is also the debut launch pad as music composer for State Award winner singer Sithara Krishnakumar. She teams up with Midhun Jayaraj as music director, for the film. Udalazham’s BGM is by Bijibal.
