Gurgaon:   is planning to carry out an anti-encroachment drive along the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) on July 20 to pave the way for expansion of the road.

 The urban development authority had acquired 90 metres of land on either side of the SPR to develop a green area and to widen the road in the future.
 
 
  
 
 Huda officials said the   have not only destroyed the green space but has also deprived residents of pedestrian space. Roadside parking results in huge traffic jams on the stretch during peak hours.
 
 Huda administrator   told TOI that many illegal shops, eateries and liquor vends have come up on the road between sectors 62 and 65 that have spoiled the development plan of the authorities. “We will remove all those encroachments,” Yadav said.
 
 “The encroachments on SPR have given rise to security concerns in the area. Moreover, they have made the area accident-prone,” said  , a resident of Emerald Hills, a housing project on SPR. On hearing about the demolition drive, Sourik Ginoria, a resident Sector 65, heaved a sigh of relief and said that finally they would be able to use the footpath.
