Panaji: The   really doesn’t mean anything now, at least in the eyes of the   (AIFF).
 
  The AIFF did not depute any of its high-ranking official, or member of the executive committee, for the Santosh Trophy final in Goa on Sunday.
  
  The only AIFF official in Goa was  , director (competitions) and he has been camping in Goa for a week now to oversee the smooth conduct of the championship.
  
  Neither AIFF president Praful Patel, any of the five vice-presidents, or AIFF general secretary Kushal Das were seen for the final.
  
  “What can we say? If the AIFF treats the Santosh Trophy in this manner, how can anyone else view it differently? We did our best on the organizational front. The AIFF should have given the tournament a little bit of respect. This is India’s National Football Championship,” said a senior Goa Football Association executive committee member.
  
  The AIFF and   has hardly seen eye-to-eye ever since three Goan clubs pulled out of the   and Goa were denied a place in the new AIFF executive committee.
