KOLKATA: Four years ago, during Trevor Morgan and  's previous stint with East Bengal, the Perth-based British coach had dropped the Indian striker for the high-voltage clash against   on disciplinary ground after the latter arrived late for the match-eve training session. East Bengal played out a goalless draw in that return-leg derby on February 9 in 2013, but relations between the two remained strained till the end of the season before both left the club.

 Having reunited at the red and gold this season, Robin repaid the coach's faith after being brought in as a second-half substitute at Barasat stadium on Sunday. CK Vineeth's early goal for BFC had been cancelled out by East Bengal's Ugandan defender   in the first half itself. The game was evenly poised at 1-1 when the striker, having replaced Ildar Amirov found the winner in the 79th minute.
