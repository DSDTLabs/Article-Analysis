Jaipur:   (RPSC), the body entrusted with the task of recruiting government employees is now without a head after its chairman Shyam   retired on September 28.

 Shyam Sunder Sharma was appointed as chairman of RPSC a few months back (July 11) as he was the senior most member after   officer Lalit K Pawar completed his term. The commission is an eight-member body including the chairman. Chairman’s post is a constitutional one with the governor appointing the head. The term of the chairman and members is that of six years or 62 years of age, whichever is earlier. At present the post of the chairman and two members are vacant.
 
 Now the government has to find a suitable person to fill this important post as it has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The RPSC has been often pulled up by the high court for its mismanagement and inefficiency in conducting exams. The high court on many occasions observed that RPSC’s inefficiency is a major reason for unwanted litigations in the courts due to its botched up competitive exams.
 
 The five members at present at the helm of RPSC are RD Saini, Surjeetlal Meena, KR Bagaria, Shiv Singh Rathore and Rajkumari Gurjar. Senior members RD Saini, Surjeetlal Meena and KR Bagaria are Congress appointees and they are not likely to be promoted to the post of chairperson by the BJP government while the remaining two are too inexperienced.
 
 According to sources the government might go with a retired bureaucrat to fill up this post of chairman considering that administrative inexperience is a major problem plaguing premier recruiting agency of the state government. Many names including current chief secretary Ashok Jain and DGP   are in circulation for the post as both of them retire by the end of this year.
