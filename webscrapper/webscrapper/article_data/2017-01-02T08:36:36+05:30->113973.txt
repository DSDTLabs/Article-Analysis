ALLAHABAD: The district’s   will run on solar power following state government nod to the ‘Green Police Line’ project of the city police. State government has already sanctioned Rs 1 crore for the project and Allahabad reserve police lines would be the first in the state to get the green tag.

Inspector general of police (Allahabad zone) Dr K S   told TOI that after state government sanctioned funds for the project, UPNEDA (Uttar Pradesh New &  ) was asked to install solar panels at the earliest.
 
 Kumar added, “Electricity bills of reserve police line exceed Rs 52-55 lakh annually, so we consulted UPNEDA project officer,  , who conducted a survey and presented a DPR (detailed project report).”
 
 As per the plan, solar panels of total 130 KW would be installed at different buildings of reserve police lines including at the barracks (80 KW), modern police control room (40 KW) and the quarters (10 KW). 
 
 Solar power generated would be utilised to meet the day-to-day requirements of the reserve police line and the project in which the facility is to be put in place function in own buildings. The objective behind this initiative is to harness solar power and reduce the electricity bills.
