Nagpur: The principle of natural justice is that no person shall be a judge in his own case and that no person shall be condemned unheard. Thus, the principle refers to the concept of fair set of trials, said Avinash Gordey, a senior advocate, on Wednesday. 
 
 Delivering a lecture on ‘Changing trends in principles of natural justice’, organized by the study circle committee of High Court Bar Association (HCBA), Gordey said the aim is to ensure that people get equal opportunities in defending themselves. 
  
 Initially, the principle of natural justice was applicable only to judicial and quasi-judicial cases. However, its scope was expanded to include administrative functions as well. At a later stage, the lawmakers updated the definition to avoid prejudices, if any, Gordey said. 
  
 He cited examples from historic cases such as AK Kraipak vs Union of India wherein the principle of natural justice came into play. “It is important that judiciary takes into consideration all aspects of the case and delivers judgment without any bias. Such a practice will ensure that no party involved in the case felt hurt,” Gordey added. 
  
 Gordey interacted with the audience and discussed the doubts they had on the topic. 
  
 HCBA secretary advocate Praful Khubalkar said that natural justice is one of the most crucial concepts in judiciary. Budding lawyers are introduced to different concepts in judicial system through lectures. The association conducts such activities regularly to guide its members as part of the learning process. Overall development of junior members is the area of focus. Various queries are discussed and solved by organizing such lectures, he added.
