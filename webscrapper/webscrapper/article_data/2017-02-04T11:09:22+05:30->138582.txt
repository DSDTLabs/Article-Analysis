MADURAI: A researcher at the   has developed a  , which can be a boon to those on the battlefield as well as in the medical field. The fabric can  , dry fast and has   properties,   T Surya Prabha of the   told TOI.

 She had been working on ‘superhydrophobic coating with special properties for fabrics’ under the guidance of MG Sethuraman, professor of Chemistry at the university. “The breakthrough came in December last year. When cellulose fabric is dipped in copper acetate solution, the fibers get coated with a thin layer of copper. It is reduced with ascorbic acid and then treated with stearic acid. The treated fabric has a water contact angle of 159 degrees, which is similar to that of lotus leaves, and hence repels water and liquids like blood,” she said.
 
 As it contains copper, the fabric has anti-microbial properties, said Sethuraman. “It was tested using both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It has also been found to have a UV filtering property and quick-drying property, making it suitable for people who have to work in wet or cold conditions, like soldiers. Wet clothes can lead to infections. Use of clothe made from this fabric avoids such situations,” he said, adding that the cloth could also be used to filter oil from water.
 
 The finding has been published in Cellulose, a quarterly international journal and has also been sent to the Defence Research and Development Organisation for funding for large-scale development. 
 
 As the cloth will have lesser breathability than the normal cotton, it is more suitable for use in higher altitudes. The production cost would only be slightly higher than the ordinary cotton if it is mass produced, the researcher added.
