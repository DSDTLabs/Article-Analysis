ALLAHABAD: Member of   ( ) and son of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri,   said on Tuesday that Congress-SP alliance will get absolute majority as the alliance is going to win over 250 seats in the assembly polls. 

 Shastri was in Sangam City to campaign for party candidate AN Singh, contesting from City North assembly segment. 
 
 He claimed that the youth jodi of   president   and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is being liked and appreciated by the people across the state and this was evident from the huge crowds at their roadshows. He also praised chief minister Akhilesh Yadad for launching welfare schemes across the state.
 
 Shastri claimed that in 2012 assembly elections, SP and Congress had got 29 and 12 per cent votes respectively and, if combined, the vote share percentage will translate into a win for the alliance. 
 
 He also claimed that people of the state are fed up with the false promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the graph of his popularity was declining every passing day. The working style of the prime minister was also confusing and Modi had failed on all fronts, claimed the Congress leader.
 
 He said that with senior SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav as patron (sanrakshak) of the SP, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is taking the party to the skies. 
 
 On being asked about the seat-sharing formula and that candidates of both SP and Congress are contesting against each other on 17 assembly seats, Shastri said it would have no impact on the results. He also said that sometimes unusual things take place in coalition politics. 
 
 Meanwhile, UPCC spokesman Kishore Varshney said that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad would be arriving in Sangam city on February 17 to campaign for alliance candidates.
