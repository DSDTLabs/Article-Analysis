Actress   is happy that she and her partner   do not put pressure on themselves to get married. 

 The 30-year-old star, who has been dating the musician since 2012, said while they are still blissfully in love, they have no plans to tie the knot anytime soon.
 
  
  
 "I am not against marriage in any way, but I do like the fact that Jack and I have placed zero pressure on ourselves about it. I have friends who have met someone, married them and got divorced during the period of time that Jack and I have been dating. We are as close as you can get to a pair of 100 year old people. Every night we go home, walk our dogs, put them into their crates, take melatonin, watch 20 minutes of  , then we go to sleep. It is the schedule of ancient, ancient  ," she said.
