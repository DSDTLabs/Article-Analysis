BENGALURU: Government doctors say a lot of streamlining needs to be done if   have to meet the pharmaceutical needs of patients.

 “We are with the public and the government in saying that drugs must be given from hospitals or through Jan Aushadhis and we don't intend to write prescriptions. But the government has to ensure that there's no interruption in supply of medicines to government hospitals, right from the state-level hospitals to primary health centres. There are many lapses in the system while procuring drugs from the  ,“ said Dr R Rang anath, president, KGMOA.These include non-availability of essential drugs, he said, adding: “In many cases, hospitals don't have the required drugs when an online indent is raised. Also, there are instances of   giving `No stock' certificates.“
 
 The mandate is that hospitals procure medicines using funds issued by Arogya Raksha Samithi. Dr Ranganath, however, said there's a delay in release of funds by the samithi. “The fund should be deposited to hospital accounts in April. But there is a delay and money comes only in June or July . The government has to work on these issues,“ he added.

 While the health department may be justified in seeking an undertaking from government doctors on prescribing generic drugs that must be bought from hospital pharmacies, withholding salaries seems to be a harsh remedy. Doctors need to be honest to their cause and not unnecessarily direct patients to procure medicines from elsewhere.The government too needs to have a more robust supply chain in place to avoid shortage of drugs. Timely disbursal of funds for their procurement seems to be another area of concern. Playing the blame game won't offer a cure. Whatever the solution, patients' well-being should be paramount.
