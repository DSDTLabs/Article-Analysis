NEW DELHI:   who earned a reprieve for former Indian navy commander   causing a huge wave of relief to wash over the country was PM  's first choice for attorney general.

 Although Salve turned down the offer to be the top law officer citing his commitments, Modi had tried to persuade him to change his mind, even delayed the announcement of his pick for the coveted position.
 
 Importantly, it was the second time that Salve had declined to be  . The first offer came his way during the Vajpayee government when Soli J Sorabjee wanted to step down after completing three years as AG. Salve, however, did not accept the offer.
 
 With the three-year term of the incumbent Mukul Rohatgi ending in June, possibility of Modi renewing his pitch to Salve was already being speculated. The applause by Modi and his ministers on Thursday only gave further ballast to it.
