 Kamal Hassan has been quite active on social media sharing his opinions on the functioning of the state government. The Viswaroopam actor has received great support from his fans and the opposition   for talking about corruption in the state.

 The actor recently urged people to address corruption woes with the ministers directly by sending emails to them. The Bigg Boss host also received a lot of flak from the ruling ministers for doing so.
 
 Now, the recent development is that   party president and former actor Captain   has come in support of his industry colleague. While addressing the media persons, Vijayakanth has said that Kamal Hassan has only spoken the truth about the politicians in the state.
 
 This is a much-needed support for Kamal from a veteran actor, who has been into politics for quite some time. It is expected that Superstar Rajinikanth, a longtime friend of Kamal will voice his support for the actor soon.
