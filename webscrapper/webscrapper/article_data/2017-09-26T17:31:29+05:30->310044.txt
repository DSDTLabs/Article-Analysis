PATNA: High Commissioner of Mauritius to India Jagdishwar Goburdhun on Tuesday called on   CM   at the latter’s official residence at 1, Anne Marg here and invited him to his country on November 2 on the occasion of the 183th anniversary of ‘Aapravasi Diwas’ in Mauritius.

 ‘Aapravasi Diwas’ is observed in Mauritius every year on November 2 to commemorate arrival of first batch of indentured labourers from India. 
 
 “Goburdhun invited   on behalf of the Mauritius government and urged his to attend the function as chief guest,” a press communique from the state's information and public relations department (IPRD) said. However, it was not known immediately whether CM would visit Mauritius on November 2 or not. 
 
 Bihar CM honoured Goburdhun by offering him a shawl and a memento. Goburdhun, too, offered a shawl to Bihar CM.
 
 Bihar holds a special relation with Mauritius since long time. More than 60% population of Mauritius is of Indian origin. Majority of them are   speaking people having roots in Bihar.
 
 Earlier on May 27 this year, Nitish Kumar-- who is also the the JD-U national president-- attended a lunch hosted by PM   in Delhi in honour of visiting Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth.
 
 A day earlier, Bihar CM had skipped   president Sonia Gandhi’s luncheon invite.
