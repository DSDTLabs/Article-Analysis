PATIALA: SAD MP   on Saturday called for a review of the population criteria for allocation of resources to the states by the 15th   Commission. 

  "The criteria of population adopted by the commission for finalising financial assistance to the states is loaded heavily against developed states like Punjab, whose population is much less as against the states like Uttar Pradesh and   that have been late starter so far as developmental aspects are concerned," he has said. 
 
 "The same criteria can't be applied to this state," he said. The rate of growth of population too is comparatively much less. The needs of Punjab are different and hence the same criteria can’t be applied to this state that is at a different level of development,,” he said. the Anandpur Sahib MP said in a statement.
 
 Chandumajra said that in a diverse country like India having glaring regional disparities, the Centre would have to take various other aspects into account rather than focussing mainly on population.
