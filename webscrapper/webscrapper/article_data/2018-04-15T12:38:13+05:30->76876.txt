AGRA : A physically challenged man,  , 46, the sole breadwinner in his family of five, was robbed of his monthly disability pension, Rs 300, after he was suddenly declared dead in government records nine months ago.
  
  The pension would be credited to the bank account of Lal, a resident of   village of   police jurisdiction,   district, every six months. The pension is given to physically challenged people whose family incomes are less than Rs 1000. Lal, who earlier used to do odd jobs to feed his family, had to start working as a daily wage labourer since his pension was stopped. 
  
  Speaking to TOI, Lal said, “My monthly pension stopped unexpectedly from July 14, 2017. When I went to enquire about it to the bank manager, he asked me to contact the department of disability pension. I ran from pillar to post with proof of my identity, including my Aadhar card, but no official entertained me. Panna Lal is dead, they said, referring to faulty government records.”
  
  He added, “The disability pension was helping me fulfill the needs of my family. I paid the education fee of my children with it. For the last nine months, I have been working as a daily wage labourer to support my family.”
  
  The plight of Lal was covered in local media on Friday, after which the district administration summoned him to look into the matter.  , vikalang kalyan adhikari (disabled welfare officer) of Farrukhabad said, “It’s a very sensitive issue and will be thoroughly investigated. We will find out about what went wrong that resulted in Panna being declared dead. His pension will be resumed soon.”
  
  According to the disability certificate issued by chief medical office Farrukhabad, Lal is 40 % disabled in the left leg.
