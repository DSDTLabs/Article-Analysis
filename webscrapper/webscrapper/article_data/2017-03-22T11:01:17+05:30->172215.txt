Comic actress  , who was in Chandigarh on Friday with her beau  , has found another reason to tap her feet, besides her engagement! While Bharti who has already appeared on the dance reality show   is ecstatic about dancing in yet another show  , Harsh is reasonably hesitant about his skills as a dancer. The happy couple, who have been going out for almost seven years now and plan on tying the knot sometime around December this year, exemplify the adage 'opposites attract'. 

 While Harsh is a witty man of few words and a romantic, Bharti is a constant riot of laughs and reserved in matters of the heart. Unraveling their romantic story , Bharti told us that she met Harsh in Mumbai about eight years ago. “He used to script all my acts, and after a year of working together we decided to take our relationship beyond professional ties,“ said Bharti confessing that her fiancée is the only man she has ever been in a relationship with and is glad that he will be her first and last love."
 
  
  
 An Ambarsarni herself, Bharti cannot stop gushing about Chandigarh connection, like most students in Punjab, from her days back in college. “When we used to study in Amritsar, the general belief was that if someone is going to Chandigarh t h e y must either be re ally well off or really talented,“ she beamed, “Going to Chandigarh was like going to Dubai or any other foreign country.“ Though Chandigarh is the ultimate city , she considers every city of Punjab as her home because of love for her culture.While Harsh belongs to a Gujarati family and was born and raised in Mumbai, he speaks Punjabi considerably well “all thanks to Bharti,“ he smiled.
 
 On being asked about the under-representation of women in the comedy world Bharti countered that she absolutely doesn't agree that women aren't given their due in this industry . “Not only are women given equal opportunities they are also treated with utmost respect and regard by all,“ she added.
