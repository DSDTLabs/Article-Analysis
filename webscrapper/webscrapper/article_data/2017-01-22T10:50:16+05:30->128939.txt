AMRITSAR: Finance minister   on Saturday said the SAD-BJP government in Punjab had done ‘unprecedented’ development and added that faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government at the Centre will ensure that the state government gets a third term.

 “Our government in Punjab has worked a lot on the development agenda. Amritsar has become one among other top cities of the country which have undergone enormous development. We are confident of doing extremely well in both the assembly elections and Lok Sabha by-elections,” he said adding that they would bring a continued era of development to Punjab.
 
 Blaming the   for pushing the state into one-and-a-half-decade of insurgency, he said that their coalition was not a political one but a social one that eradicated terrorism from the state.
 
 Talking about   (AAP) he said there was a time that they were strong, but people were getting to know them better with the politics and the governance they have given in Delhi. “AAP has been found out now,” he said sarcastically.
 
  Commenting on RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya’s statement that reservation policy should be reviewed, he said “From the beginning, BJP was in favour of caste-based reservation for social justice.” He said the party had always believed that reservation was the best way to eradicate the inequality which emerged due to social injustice.
 
 He said there was no other constituency in the country like Amritsar which had suffered from negligence and absentee MP like Amritasr has in last twelve and half years (including two and half year term of former MP  ).
 
 “If you check the record of Parliament ,Amritsar was virtually unrepresented. Therefore, I would be more comfortable with my elected representative who is physically present in Amritsar ,” he said.
