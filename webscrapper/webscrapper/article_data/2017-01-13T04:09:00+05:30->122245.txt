NEW DELHI: BJP has declared the names of its candidates for 17 seats in Punjab but withheld the announcement for six others, where the party has sitting MLAs, indicating that some of these MLAs could be dropped.

 These six seats include four represented by ministers in the SAD-BJP government. A couple of them could be dropped as they are over 75 years and some others are being seen as vulnerable in a poll where the alliance is facing 10 years of anti-incumbency.
 
 Party central election committee secretary   told reporters that the remaining candidates would be announced later.
 
 Five sitting MLAs are among the 17 candidates announced. BJP has 12 MLAs in the outgoing assembly. It also fielded Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina for the bypoll to Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant following the resignation of Congress leader  , who had defeated finance minister   in the 2014 polls.
 
 Rajesh Hani will contest from Amritsar East, a seat held by  , who along with her husband   has quit BJP.
