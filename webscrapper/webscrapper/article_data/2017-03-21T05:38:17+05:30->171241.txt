GURUGRAM: The Haryana Urban Development Authority ( ) is all set to restart the construction of the   of sectors 66-67 to reduce the travel time between Golf Course Extension Road and  . 

 Around a half-a-kilometre stretch of the two-kilometre-long sector 66-67 dividing road was lying incomplete due to 30 structures coming in the way of the road’s alignment. 
 
 
  
 
 The land acquisition for this road was started by Huda around eight years ago. However, in 2010-11, some land owners challenged the acquisition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, following which the HC in 2016 ordered Huda to rehabilitate the owners as per the Relocation and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy of the state government.
 
 Of the 30 structures, only four residential houses were found eligible for alternative plots as per the R&R policy. “Eligible people were given alternative plots and now we have managed to remove most of the structures,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav adding that only two structures, which claimed to have a stay from the HC were left. The staff quarter of the electricity department was given a week’s time to vacate the plot. 
 
 “After its completion, people coming from Golf Course Extension Road will be able to reach Sohna bypassing congested areas like Vatika Chowk and Badshapur village. It will also reduce the traffic load on Sohna Road and nearby areas,” Yadav added.
 
 Yadav said the city traffic is at present heavily dependent on few roads mainly due to the absence of alternative routes. “The objective is to reduce the congestion on important roads and provide commuters alternative routes,” he said.
