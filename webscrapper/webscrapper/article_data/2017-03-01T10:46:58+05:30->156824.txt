GUWAHATI: City-based   have threatened to go on   if their demands, which include   and  , were not fulfilled. 

 "We have plenty of problems but no one pays any heed to these. If this continues, we will be forced to go on an indefinite strike. We have refrained from doing so yet keeping in mind passengers," said Ismail Ali, president of All Guwahati Cab Owners' and Drivers' Association.
 
 Poor internet connectivity has emerged as drivers' biggest grouse. "Our Prime Minister talks of Digital India but, unfortunately, we sometimes need to wait for more than 15 minutes to complete a transaction. There should be other facilities for drivers as well," Ali added.
 
 According to him, around 13,000 cabs affiliated to various service providers ply the narrow roads of the city daily, leading to frequent jams. Drivers have urged service providers and the district transport office to minimize the number of cabs in service.
 
 Drivers had gone on strike a couple of months ago. "There should be a proper mechanism to control cab service from the district administration's point of view. Drivers, too, should be provided facilities. In the war between them, it is us commuters who have to suffer," said Raktim Hazarika, a resident who regularly uses cab service.
