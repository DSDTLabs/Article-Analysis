 Collector Bishnu Charan   released a poster on Thursday which would be distributed at mass level to spread awareness on road safety. "Hundreds of people are killed every year in road accidents. Many young lives are lost in road mishaps in the district and in most of the cases it has been found that the bikers didn't have proper head protection i.e they rode without helmet, thus leading to instant deaths due to head injuries. If mothers are determined and they bind their sons and daughters by making them promise not to drive without helmets, then kids are bound to obey," collector Mallick said. Before getting any new vehicle for their children, mothers should ask them to promise to ride safely and not perform any stunts on the roads.
 
  "The campaign aims to help mothers to convince their children to make it a habit to wear helmet whenever they are driving or riding on two-wheelers. The youths, specially boys should be made to realize that performing stunts on bikes and speed could be very dangerous," Mallick said. On the occasion regional transport officer Dr MannaLal Rawat, ARTO PL Bamnia, DTO Kalpana Sharma too were present.
