Vadodara: The GEB Engineers Association (GEBEA) that represents engineers of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd and its subsidiaries has threatened to go on a strike to press for its long pending demands regarding revision of salaries and allowances of engineers. A release by GEBEA states that the issue of betterment of emoluments of engineers and Assured Career Progression (ACP) was being discussed since a year-and-a-half now. The association had made oral and written representations regarding this to senior officials and the government.
