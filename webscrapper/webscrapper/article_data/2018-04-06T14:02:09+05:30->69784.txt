PATNA: Chief minister   on Thursday said the state government was focusing on creating self-help groups of families in rural areas in a bid to stop them from getting indulged in illegal liquor trade.

 Addressing a programme to mark the completion of two years of prohibition in the state at   here, the CM said  , an NGO, is already in the process of identifying families involved in liquor manufacturing. “These families will be provided with employment opportunities by the government. The target is to create at least eight lakh self-help groups, each consisting of at least eight to ten families,” the CM said, adding around 1.25 crore families would be given either cattle or e-rickshaws so that they can earn livelihood by shunning illegal liquor trade.
 
 The CM gave the example of a family in   district to drive home his point. “The family was involved in liquor manufacturing. However, the members of the family gave up the illegal trade after the district administration provided them two cows,” the CM added.
 
 He said people in rural areas would be informed about hooch incidents so that they don’t consume spurious liquor sold by bootleggers in the dry state. The CM called upon women to come forward and make people aware in their neighbourhood about ill effects of liquor consumption. “Social movement against liquor consumption will continue in the state,” the CM added.
