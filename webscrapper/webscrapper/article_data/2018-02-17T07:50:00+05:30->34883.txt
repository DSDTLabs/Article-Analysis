CHANDIGARH: Former power and irrigation minister   was in the spotlight yet again, as sleuths of the income tax (I-T) department on Friday morning “raided” the Chandigarh office of companies he is associated with. Hours after an I-T team reached the office in the morning, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) targetted the   MLA. 

 AAP leader   said though he too had made a complaint against Gurjit’s company for raising loans more than the permissible limits, there could be some other complaint behind the action. “It is important that law takes its own course in such matters,” he said.
 
 On the other hand, when contacted,   said the raid had nothing to do with him. “It is on office premises. If you want to know anything, you should talk to the managing director or those at the helm of these companies. I, as a politician, am not involved in this. The media needs to take an objective view of things. The I-T team has not come to my residence,” he said.
 
 Sources said the I-T team carried out the exercise till afternoon. The office is in the name of   and most of the senior employees reached there after the I-T team had already landed.
 
 The corridor outside the office was witness to a lot of commotion, with a large number of journalists and onlookers converging there. Employees and officials of various companies under the Rana Group of Companies were reportedly not allowed to enter the premises after the raid started. The offices of Rana Sugars, Rana Polycot, Rana Distilleries and Rana Informatics are located in the same premises.
 
 Gurjit had last month resigned as power and irrigation minister, over allegations of conflict of interest in the auction of sand mines. Before this, the Enforcement Directorate had issued summons to Gurjit’s son in connection with raising of funds abroad. Chief minister   had constituted a one-member judicial commission under Justice J S Narang to investigate the sand mines e-auction issue.
