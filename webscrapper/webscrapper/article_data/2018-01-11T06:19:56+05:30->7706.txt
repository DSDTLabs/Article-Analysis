HOLALKERE (CHITRADURGA):   national president   on Wednesday used the Parivarthana Yatra platform in Holalkere to settle scores with chief minister  , who had questioned the Centre’s contribution to Karnataka.

 Choosing Holalkere as his first rally outside Bengaluru, BJP sources said Shah wanted
 
 to reach out primarily to the   vote bank of backward castes, including SC/ST voters, numbering over 35,000 in this reserved constituency.
 
 Shah was vocal in his attack against Siddaramaiah. “Arrey, CM Siddaramaiah ne hamse hisaab manga hai, hum unhe hisaab dene Karnataka aaye hai (CM Siddaramaiah has asked for the accounts of Centre’s contribution to Karnataka, I am here to give the accounts),” Shah said.
 
 According to him, the funds Karnataka had received from the Centre and under the 14th   Commission was Rs 3lakh crore. “Now, the people of Karnataka are asking for accounts from you. Where has all the money gone? Into the pockets of Congress party leaders?” he asked.
 
 “If you want know where the money siphoned off by the Karnataka Congress government has gone, look at the nearest Congress leader in your village. He would have constructed a four-floor apartment and has a brand new car in front of his home, where five years ago, he was staying in a hut and had a Luna,” Shah said.
 
 Shah made the rally interactive by involving the public, with state BJP general secretary Arvind Limbavali acting as the Kannada interpreter for the national president. The burgeoning crowd at the small ground at Holalkere -- estimated to be 20,000 to 25,000 -- gave Shah a resounding welcome and cheered his every dialogue.
 
 During his half-hour long speech, Shah raised various scams and scandals of the Congress regime in the state, including the controversy over the Hublot watch worth Rs 70 lakh given to Siddaramaiah, and the Arkavathy Layout denotification scandal, whose report has not seen the light of day.
