PANAJIi: Former deputy speaker and   leader Vishnu Wagh has returned to Goa, seven months after suffering a near fatal cardiac arrest. 

 Addressing the press about his present health condition, Wagh’s wife, Aruna shared that the ex-MLA from St   constituency has been allowed to return to his home as a part of the ongoing treatment. 
 
 “He was discharged on the April 5th, though technically, this is part of the treatment. The doctors want to see how he responds to the treatment at home over a month as the natural surroundings may have a positive impact on his health. His treatment will resume at the hospital,” Aruna informed, adding that there are no restrictions on him to meet people and visitors will be allowed from Monday onwards, between 5pm and 6.30pm.
 
 The doctors have given four major restrictions for Wagh’s recovery. 
 
 “He cannot go through physical stress. Second, as he is a sensitive person and now his heart is also sensitive. He cannot exert himself emotionally. We have also been told to take care regarding any infection. The last is that he has to be fed every two hours and the schedule has to be maintained. It includes medicines, exercises, speech therapy and physiotherapy” she said, adding that the doctors are happy with his ongoing progress. 
 
 The former   was at the Hinduja hospital for 16 days but later got shifted to the Kokilaben hospital due to better neurosurgeon facilities.
 
 “He is currently dependent on people for sitting and standing. His motor skills are still not fully functional and that is why there is extensive physiotherapy. There is also psychological therapy going on. You have to attend him for 24 hours. But we are hopeful that he will come back in full swing with the love of the people,” Aruna said.
