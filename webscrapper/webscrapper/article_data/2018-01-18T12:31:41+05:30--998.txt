MADURAI:   Chamber of Commerce and Industry here appealed the central government to extend dates for filing   forms considering the fact that there are technical glitches due to which many are not able to file the forms in time. According to the statement from the trade body, many tax payers were unable to file Form GST TRAN-1 for taking transitional credit within the prescribed last date of December 27, 2017, due to technical glitches faced by them.

 Likewise while filing GSTR-3B for the month of December 2017 which has to be filed before January 20, with payment of tax, tax payers are not able to offset the tax liability and complete their return filing process due to the error, “check sum, validation failed.” 
 
 Tax payers and tax practitioners who are filing GST returns and confronting such errors have no solution for them. Perhaps these flaws occur due to very heavy load on the server which is a common trend on the portal.
 
 It is inappropriate to penalise tax payers for not filing   – 1 Form and GSTR – 3B Return before the last dates for the technical shortfalls in the server. These shortcomings in the server should be set right immediately. Till then, it is imperative that   extend the last date for filing GSTR-3B from January 20. For the same reason, the last date for filing Form TRAN – 1 should also be extended to February 15 and announcement should be made in this regard by the GST Council in its next meeting to be held on January 18, the trade body observed in its statement.
