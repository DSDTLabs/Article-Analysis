Bhopal: The Aamir Khan-starrer ‘Dangal’, based on the Phogat sisters, has got the thumbs-up from chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The CM was so impressed that after watching a late night show on Friday, he promptly announced tax exemption. Madhya Pradesh joins Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Haryana in giving the blockbuster tax-free status. 

 Chouhan watched the movie with wife Sadhna Singh and sons Kunal and Kartikey on Friday. On stepping out of the cinema, the CM congratulated Aamir for making a movie that “conveys a strong social message that girls are in no way inferior to boys”. “Outstanding movie,” he said.
 
 The film is based on the real-life story of wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat, who were trained — driven, rather — to success by their pehelwan father Mahavir Singh Phogat. It’s been in theatres for about a month.
 
 “The movie sends across a strong message of ‘Beti Bachao’ (save the girl child). I thank Aamir for having conceived such an inspirational idea based on a true story,” said Chouhan. Mahavir Singh Phogat’s resolve to see his daughters make it to the top of the wrestling world and bringing laurels to the country is commendable, he added, urging “all fathers to draw inspiration from Dangal”.
