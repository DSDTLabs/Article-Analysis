Guntur: Stating that more number of   have been issued than the number of families, state food commission chairman JR Pushparaj has asked officials to conduct a social audit in all ration depots to prevent irregularities. 

 He said services under the Food Security Act - 2013 can be provided to all poor only when the data of beneficiaries is correct. Reviewing the implementation of the Act with officials here on Friday, Pushparaj said they found serious discrepancies during a pilot audit at 310 ration shops in seven mandals of three districts. 
 
 He said they could not get full details of about 36,847 cards of the total 1,63,468 valid cards in these shops. Pushparaj said, “Either the beneficiaries were away or the officials are negligent in collecting details. We need to track the beneficiaries to grant ration.” He said the audit was conducted at Rompicherla, Nakirekallu, Machavaram, Epuru, and Muppalla of Guntur district, Nakkapalli of Visakhapatnam district, and Yemmiganur of Kurnool district.
 
 Pushparaj said there are some 1.44 crore ration cards in circulation in the state, but the pulse survey could identify the presence of only 1.32 crore families. He said that about 12 lakh excess cards were counted in the pulse survey. He asked officials not to deprive any eligible family of the ration. He said that women and child welfare department, and the civil supplies department should work in tandem to provide the poor benefits of the Food Security Act. Civil supplies principal secretary B Rajasekhar, food commission secretary G Ravi Babu, commission members G Krishnamma, Dr Swarna Bharathi, S Vijaya Kumar, LB Venkatrao, and Srinivasa Rao attended the meeting.
