THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Robots will soon replace humans in cleaning sewer holes in Kerala, ending the age-old practice of manual scavenging in the state. 

  Bandicoot, the robot developed by the startup firm  , will be used for cleaning sewer holes. 
 
    (KWA) and   (KSUM) signed an MoU on Thursday for transfer of technology and products, including use of the robots for the purpose. 
 
  The MoU was signed between   at the chief minister's office, a statement said. 
 
  Bandicoot will start its work, so far mostly done manually, by cleaning sewer holes in Thiruvananthapuram during the upcoming Attukal Pongala festival in March. 
 
 The robot has four limbs and a   looking extension, which can make its way to a manhole. 
 
 Once the heap of garbage is shovelled from the manhole, it will be lifted and dumped on to the bucket. It comes with WiFi and bluetooth modules.
 
  KSUM had funded the project by Genrobotics, which conducted a study to end manual scavenging. 
 
  Genrobotics plans to market the product in six months. It has got enquiries from other states, including Tamil Nadu. Founded in 2015, Genrobotics specialises in powered exoskeletons and human controlled robotic systems. Bandicoot is powered by pneumatics (using gas or pressurised air) as heavy electronic mechanisms would react with explosive gases usually present in the manhole.
