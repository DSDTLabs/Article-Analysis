AHMEDABAD: The   has taken up a feasibility study to ascertain if the   (AMTS) and the   (GSRTC) buses can use the   passing from the city.

 Senior AMC officials said AMC fears that pushing AMTS and GSRTC buses on to BRT lanes could lead to congestion and increase the travel time for the BRT consumer. 
 
 “The BRT team fears this could reduce the number of passenger travelling in BRT,” said the senior officer.
 
 Sources in the AMC said, “The team is studying each stretch closely to study the number of buses including the GSRTC buses passing from the area. The officials said that according to an estimate if the GSRTC buses were pushed inside the corridor the gap between two buses might be reduced to just a couple of minutes on busy stretches like Nehrunagar to Iskcon.
 
 Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar admitted that the AMC is carrying out a survey after which they will take the final call.
 
 AMC officials said they are also looking at the possibility of only allowing AMTS buses, and not GSRTC buses on the BRT lanes. 
 
 The AMTS buses have a frequency gap of 10 minutes while the same in BRT ranges from five to seven minutes. It was possible for AMC to revise the timing of AMTS buses.
 
 An officer said that the step might lead to congestion on BRT tracks. One can often see atleast two to three buses following each other closely and in such cases it would lead to major jams in the AMTS.
 
 The government had in November ratified the decision convert the BRT corridor into Urban Transport Corridor allowing buses including AMTS, GSRTC, school buses among others during peak hours.
 
 It is worth recalling that former municipal commissioner D Thara had first mooted the plan in late 2015 to re-designate BRTS corridor and even began to ply 250 AMTS city buses on the BRTS lane. In the 2016 AMC budget Thara had proposed a plan for the UTC.
