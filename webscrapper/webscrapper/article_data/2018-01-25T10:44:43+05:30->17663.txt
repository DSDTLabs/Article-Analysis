PUNE: Four persons, including a woman, were injured as a speeding   hit four vehicles after brake failure on NIBM-Undri Road around 2.30pm on Wednesday.

 The vehicular traffic on the road was hit for nearly 45 minutes after the accident. “The truck was headed towards NIBM Chowk from   when its driver, Shailendra Patel from Madhya Pradesh, lost control over the vehicle due to brake failure. The truck hit a school van, a scooter and a car before crashing into a water tanker,” assistant inspector Santosh   of the   police said.
 
 The officer said the school was not ferrying students when the accident occurred. “The van driver, Siddharth Gedam (30), and his mother have sustained minor injuries. Two others injured have not approached police so far,” Tasgaonkar added. 
 
 “The truck driver has also suffered internal injuries. We took him in custody, following the FIR lodged by the van driver under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act,” he said.
 
 Inspector  , in-charge of the Kondhwa police traffic branch, said, “We rushed to the spot and pressed a crane into service for removing the damaged vehicles to the side of the road. It took us around 45 minutes to restore traffic to normalcy on the road.”
 
 He said, “We have been told by the passersby that the truck driver was shouting, informing road users about the brake failure before the accident occurred. The truck stopped after hitting the water tanker, else it would have hit more vehicles.”
