PUNE: The   of   for the Smart Cities company has been put on the back-burner with its   members rejecting the proposal on the ground that it will create hurdles in carrying out the projects transparently.

 “...Not to engage with any member of the press or media in matters connected with the company or its business specifically permitted by the board of directors of the company or the chairman / managing director of the company,” stated the proposal
 
 Chetan Tupe, one of the board members, said the the proposal was discussed on Saturday. “We opposed to it and the proposal stands cancelled,” he told TOI. 
 
 Tupe, who is also the leader of the opposition in the civic body, said board members across the party line were against the proposal. They felt that it was “against the state government’s policy of giving more power to citizens”.
 
 Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said the citizens have the rights to know what is happening in the board. “Not allowing sharing of information is against the democratic principles. The   projects will be carried out with tax payers’ money. They must know how their money is being utilised,” he said. 
 
 The code of conduct would have put restrictions on sharing information with the public and the media. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) was formed for the Smart City mission and registered in March 2016.
