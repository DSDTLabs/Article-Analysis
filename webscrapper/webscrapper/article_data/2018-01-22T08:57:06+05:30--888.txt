CHANDIGARH: Paramjeet Singh, 25, a mechanic from   in  , had a contagious smile that could repair broken hearts. His benevolent spirit and giving nature live on after his death.

 “He used to donate clothes and food to those in need,” his father,  , said when Paramjeet’s mortal remains were handed over to him at the   mortuary. “Now his liver and kidneys will give a second life to three patients who were at the end-stage organ failure with slim chances of survival. His corneas will restore sight to two more patients.” The organs were harvested for transplant after the family’s incredible courage to agree to donate these.
 
 Satish Kumar said: “My son was so caring and compassionate that he never worried about getting anything in return. He always looked to make others happy.” On January 9, a tractor trailer collided with Paramjeet’s motorcycle in Una. The family moved him to the civil hospital, where doctors referred him to the PGI the same day. The PGI doctors met twice at night on January 11 before they declared him brain dead.
 
 “Our world came crashing,” recalls a grief-stricken Satish Kumar. “Then the transplant coordinators at the PGI talked to us about organ donation. Even though we didn’t have the heart to take Paramjeet off life support, the idea of having a chance to save someone else’s life made sense to us.” He is certain that Paramjeet would have agreed, too.
