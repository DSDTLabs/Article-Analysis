THARA (BANASKANTHA): There was shock and awe as the video was shock and awe as the video of the Indian Airforce Force ( ) helicopter dramatically winching a man, clinging to an electric pole for life, to safety even as flood waters ravaged below him in   went viral on social media. The man,  , a 20 year old farmer now living in a relief camp in Thara, too, confesses his being alive is nothing short of a miracle.
“I was staring at death from the height of the electric pole even as violent river water washed away all life, including humans and animals, that came in its way. It is God's will that I am alive,“ says Channaji.
 
 Channaji is one of the 40 members of the extended Thakore family in Khariya village which has lost at least 17 members of the family whose bodies were recovered, buried in muck, on the banks of river Banas. The sight of the bodies had shaken one and all.
 
 “It was a horrbile night.Water levels suddenly rose and my brother Vanraj and his family climbed on the top of roof of his thatched house. I climbed a tree for safety. I sat on the tree for a few hours till I saw my disabled sister atop a tree. I climbed down thinking I would save her, but the water current dragged me for over a kilometre and half.“
 
 Channaji says he was shocked beyond comprehension and thought nothing of catching hold of electric power lines hanging below. “I did not think I could die of electric shock. I just knew I had to catch hold of something to prevent the river water from killing me,“ says Channaji.
 
 Against the river tide, he climbed atop an electric pole-the only abode of safety. “I clung to the pole for eight long hours before a helicopter saw me flagging my white vest and threw the lifeline,“ says Channaji.
 
 Channaji is reunited with his immediate family, but says they cannot go back and live where they lost 17 of their kin. “It will take 10 years for us to stand on our feet. Pray for us,“ says the survivor.
