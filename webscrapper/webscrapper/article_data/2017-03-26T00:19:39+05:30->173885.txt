MUMBAI: On demand from a students’ organisation,   University’s vice-chancellor has agreed to re-asses the papers of 10% of the failed   for free. If many students from these pass after  , the   has agreed to do it for all students free of cost.

 Over 85% of the 702 students failed in the first semester of   results declared last week.
 
 Many students also complained about the delayed results, which give them less time to apply for re-evaluation before the repeaters’ exam on April 5. Sudhakar Tamboli, a student activist, said they approached the vice-chancellor, Sanjay Deshmukh, seeking re-assessment of answersheets of all students who failed the test. “The V-C has promised to re-assess answersheets of 10% of the students and then, based on the outcome, he will decide on the remaining papers. LLM results have never been so poor. Close to 50 per cent students pass the exams. We have demanded re-evaluation without any fee,” said Tamboli.
