The incident, which exposed a divide within the party, took place when a large number of Congress leaders and office-bearers climbed on the stage erected on IMC’s main gate and Tandon asked some of the occupants to vacate the space. “The chair is not for you. You should give it to the senior party leaders” Tandon shouted at one of the party worker and forced him to step down from the stage.
