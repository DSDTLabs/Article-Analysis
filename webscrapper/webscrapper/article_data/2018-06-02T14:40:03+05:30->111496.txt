COIMBATORE: Union minister for information and broadcasting   downplayed the recent bypoll defeats suffered by   in several states and hoped people would back the saffron party, given the achievements of the Centre in the last four years.

 
 Rathore was in the city on Friday to brief journalists about the achievements of the Central government. The government is working on a mission to strengthen the country without the fear of losing elections, he said. “We are very confident. Our government has done several things, which are unprecedented. A large number of people will realise that and vote for their future,” the minister said.
 
 The government is taking steps not with the voter in mind but to make the country stronger, he said. “From day one, the government was working on curbing corruption and brining transparency. The government is going hard on loan defaulters and fugitive economic offenders and will intensify the fight against corruption. Steps have been taken to bring fugitive economic offenders back to India,” he said. 
 
 Reeling out statistics on the achievements of the BJP government, the minister said 10 crore people have benefited from  , of which 70% are women. “Thirty-one crore bank accounts have been opened for the masses, three lakh villages have been made open-defecation free and 18,000 villages were electrified. We have achieved in 48 months what the earlier governments run by a family could not in 48 years,” he said, hitting out at  .
 
 To a query whether his party was worried about its prospects in Tamil Nadu, Rathore said the party was concerned about the whole country and called upon the people to understand the reason and logic behind the centre’s decisions.
 
 On fuel price rise, he said the states are unwilling to let go taxes accrued from petrol and diesel. “A discussion is going on to bring fuel under GST. Central government is working on a long-term basis so as to bring comfort to a large number of people,’’ he added.
