MUMBAI: A student from Virar has been allotted a centre at Kharghar for his   exam scheduled on May 6. Another student from Kandivli has got a centre at Nhava in Raigad. Several students are hassled over the far-off   allotted to them for the national medical entrance test. Theyreceived their NEET hall tickets on Tuesday.

 To avoid overcrowding, the CBSE has given two slots for students to enter their centres—7.30am to 8.30am and 8.30am to 9.30am. The ones in the 7.30am-8.30am slot will be forced to leave home by 5.30am-6am, say parents. 
 
  
 A parent of a Virar student said, “As we have got a centre in Kharghar, we have decided to book a hotel room there the night before to avoid getting delayed. We will have to ensure that our son gets sound sleep the night before the exam. Waking up at 4am to reach the centre at 7.30am for the 10am exam will only add to his stress.”
 
 The other parent whose daughter is scheduled to write the exam in Raigad said he thought centres would be allocated on first-come-first-served basis. “But this allotment seems to be system-generated. We plan to check out the location this Sunday,” said the parent. Another parent said his son and his friend from Mira Road had filled the exam form at the same time but the latter managed to get Andheri and his son got a centre in Navi Mumbai. tnn
