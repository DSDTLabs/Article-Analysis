BENGALURU: A   over   at his   on Wednesday. The deceased,  , 38, was an   in Kamakshipalya.

 
 In a 24-page death note addressed to DCP (west) Ravi D Channannanavar, he claimed his wife was having an affair with the owner of the gas agency. The note also contained photos, which Mohan claimed were clicked when she was talking to her lover.
 
 The family, however, brushed aside his allegations. “Suspecting his wife, Mohan had repeatedly visited police stations,” family members said. “Finding no truth, police had counselled Mohan. His wife was treated for uterus-related problems because of which she kept a distance from him. Mohan misunderstood her.”
 
 Besides his wife, Mohan is survived by a 11-year-old daughter.
