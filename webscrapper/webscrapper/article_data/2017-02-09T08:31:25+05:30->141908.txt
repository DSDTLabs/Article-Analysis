PANAJI:   will be constituted on Thursday to carry out physical verification of   along the highways. A core committee constituted by chief secretary is meeting to monitor the implementation of the Supreme Court’s order for closure of all liquor shops along   across the country.

 Excise commissioner Menino D’Souza said they could not hold meetings while the code of conduct was in force. 
 
 The core committee headed by D’Souza was ordered to meet fortnightly and submit their action report to the office of the chief secretary. Goa has 11,000-odd alcohol licences with majority retailers and wholesalers located along the highways. 
 
 “The taluka-level committees will conduct physical examination,” D’Souza said, adding that the licences of shops within 500m of the outer edge of a national or state highway will not be renewed.
 
 The process of collating data of shops and establishments along the national and state highways is under way and the excise department hopes to have the data shortly.
 
 Alcohol shops within 500m of the outer edge of a national or state highway, or service lane along the highway have to be removed. Signage about availability of liquor along the highways have been ordered to be removed by April 1.
