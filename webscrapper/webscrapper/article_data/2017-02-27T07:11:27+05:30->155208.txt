CHENNAI: In a city where auto drivers refuse to ply by the meter,   were a big relief for commuters. But cabbies - finding themselves at the receiving end from customers and service providers - have now decided to form an association to help address their grievances and lobby for meter-based tariff. 

 The association,   (Anaithy Maghzhundu Otunar Nala Sangam), includes drivers who work with  ,   and other local aggregators.
 
 "Around 5,000 to 6,000 drivers have contacted us, but currently we have 800 registered members. We have a presence in Chennai, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts," association head E Janakiraman said.
 
 While discounts rain down on passengers, cab drivers face issues like dwindling earnings, hostility from commuters and health problems due to long hours.
 
 "The association will be a support mechanism for drivers," said Janakiraman.
 
 Plans are afoot to start their own application as all drivers have smartphones and run a subsidised restaurant and dormitory for those on night shifts. Grievance redressal will be another crucial objective. For instance, on Friday night a commuter abused driver V Palani four hours after the trip. The association helped Palani file a complaint with the Mangadu police station.
 
 Also, drivers are under immense pressure. With increased competition, cab drivers have to slog 14 to 16 hours a day, even on weekends, to achieve their target earnings for the day.
 
 As commuters have begun to prefer cabs for short distances, the number of trips has increased. 
 
 Unionising is a legitimate way to address harassment, but cab drivers must ensure that they do not strike because many citizens depend on them for transport, said R  , a chartered accountant who regularly uses Ola and Uber.
