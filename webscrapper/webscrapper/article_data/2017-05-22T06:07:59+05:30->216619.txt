LUCKNOW: In a visit sure to send a strong political message,   will have a night stay in Varanasi on May 26, the day the   at the Centre completes three years in government.

 The CM’s visit to the Prime Minister’s Lok Sabha constituency comes at a time when there have been talks that   was elected CM on RSS’s advice and was not BJP top leadership’s choice. 
 
 This would be Yogi’s first visit to Varanasi. He was sworn in in the presence of the PM along with his 46 cabinet colleagues on March 19.
 
 On May 27, the CM will hold a review meeting of the Varanasi division before flying back to Lucknow.
 
 Whether Yogi will offer prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple or visit the ghats is not confirmed. His itinerary is still being finalised, a senior official from the CM’s secretariat told TOI.
 
 On May 26, the Union government is set to organise several programmes to mark the completion of three years of the NDA government at the Centre. Events have also been planned by the BJP all over the country from May 26 till May 31. 
 
 It is not confirmed if the UP CM will attend any such programme. What is confirmed though is that before arriving in Varanasi, Yogi will be in   on May 25 to launch the health department’s Japanese Encephalitis programme. Kushinagar is the most affected among the 38 districts in the grip of the disease, an official told TOI.

 The CM is also likely to visit village Mainpur, dominated by Musahar caste. Cases of death due to starvation in this village have made headlines on more than one occasion. As Gorakhpur MP, Yogi has raked up the issue time and again in Parliament.
 
 Several administrative officials have visited the village ever since the CM’s programme for Kushinagar was finalised.
 
 After Kushinagar, the CM will go to Azamgarh for a review meeting and then to Gorakhpur where he will attend various programmes before flying to Varanasi on May 26.
