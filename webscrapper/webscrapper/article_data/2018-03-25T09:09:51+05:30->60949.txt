MADURAI: The   (GRH) would soon get a state-of-the-art burns ward being built at a cost of Rs 6 crore. The ward will have all facilities to treat victims of fire accidents and is expected to be completed within two years.

 Speaking to TOI, dean of GRH, Dr  , said that the sanction was obtained for the new building few months ago under the   (TAEI). “It will be an entirely new building, where the civil works would be carried out to the tune of Rs 2.6 crore and Rs 1.17 crore worth of equipment,” he said, with the remaining allocation being for manpower.
 
 It would be a full-fledged hundred-bedded hospital, which could help deal with emergency situations. The ward would be equipped in such a way that as soon as a burns victim is brought there, he or she will be immersed in a bath tub, to remove any adhering burnt material from the body. It will have water beds to prevent sores and also help the victims to be rested without much pain due to their wounds. The unit will have a centralised air-conditioned and oxygen facilities in addition to others. There would be hepa filters to avoid even soft contamination from air-conditioners. There will also be an intensive care unit and general ward. The new unit will have an upgraded laboratory where escharotomy to treat third degree burns as a measure to facilitate circulation will be performed, and also an attached physiotherapy unit.
 
 Mobile x-ray units and testing facilities will ensure that the patient is not traumatised by continuous shifting. It will also have a separate section for the attenders of the patients and everyone entering it will only have to do so under strictly sterile conditions. Meanwhile, as the drawbacks in the existing 20-bedded burns ward at the GRH were realised after the recent   forest fire, a survey was conducted on Friday and an estimate prepared for approximately Rs 52 lakh to upgrade it.
