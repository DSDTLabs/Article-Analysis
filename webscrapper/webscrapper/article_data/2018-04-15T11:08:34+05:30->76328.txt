NAMAKKAL: Hardly a day passes by in the state sans protest against the central government for its failure to constitute the Cauvery Management Board (CMB). While rail blockade, road roko, burning effigies, showing black flags and laying siege to government offices are tried and tested methods of protest, a 35-year-old meat seller on Saturday staged a novel demonstration by doing 156 push-ups to reach a hilltop temple at   here with a sole request to the Centre to form   at the earliest. 

 K Prakash, of   near Tiruchengode, arrived at the foothills of Arthanareeswarar temple on Saturday morning and announced his plans to climb all the 156 steps to the temple by doing as many push-ups as a mark of protest against the Centre’s apathy towards the farmers of Tamil Nadu.
 
 Devotees on the premises welcomed this with cheer. Prakash started his journey atop the temple by doing push-ups around 9.30am and reached the hilltop shrine around 10.40am.
 
 Talking to the media, Prakash came down heavily on the central government for delaying formation of CMB for the assembly election in Karnataka. “The Centre should consider the plight of Tamil Nadu farmers, instead of looking at ways to win the election there,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that CMB was the right of Tamil Nadu people, Prakash said, “We will not give up our rights.”
