SECUNDERABAD: As many as 1,500 people, including mainly women and children, marched from   to   in   on Monday, demanding that the Army must not shut down roads. 

 "The demand is to open all the roads closed by the   (LMA) illegally till an alternative is provided. No roads should be closed without following the Cantonment Act 2006," said a protester. 
 
 The silent candle light march saw many people joining hands to voice their concern over the shut roads,which has been causing huge inconvenience to commuters in the area. 
 
 About 12 roads have been permanently closed by the LMA, citing security concerns over the past few years. "The high-handed behavior of the LMA is causing lots of problems to 20 lakh citizens," said a spokesperson for OSCAR (Open Secunderabad Cantonment Area All Roads). 
 
 At present, school and office goers have to take several detours. After 10 am, the traffic on alternate road moves at a snail's pace till late in the evening.
