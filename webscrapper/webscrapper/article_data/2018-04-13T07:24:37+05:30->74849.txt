JAIPUR: Soaring heat had led to a spike in major fire incidents in the city, said fire officials.

 The fire officials said that onset of summer has increased the power consumption, but many buildings have faulty wires which are vulnerable to overheating and short-circuits.
 
 “Fire incidents increase manifold during summer season because of increased power consumption. Most of the fire incidents reported in past few months were result of electrical malfunction,” said fire official Jalaj Ghasiya.
 
  
 The official said that not many people carry out regular testing of their wires which often triggers fire. “Power cables should be equal to the load capacity. In events of over consumption, the heating becomes the problem and leads to the short circuit,” said the official.
 
 The officials said that many people don’t carry out the regular testing of the wire and their connection which causes the fire problems. “If one looks through the cause of the fire in past major incidents, it is always short circuit. There are also companies in the industrial areas which don’t have proper fire equipment,” an official said, adding that inflammable chemicals are being stored in some factories without proper precautions which can lead to the major fire incident.
 
 The Jaipur fire officials said that average number of distress calls have increased. “Every day there is at least to five incidents of fire in the city. We have to deploy all our forces to ensure that we are able to reach at the spot on time,” the official said.
