Chandrapur: Yet another full grown sloth bear was knocked dead by a train on the Chanda Fort-Gondia railway line near Barabhati railway station in Arjuni Morgaon tehsil of Gondia district. The accident took place despite warnings and reminders from the forest department to control the speed of trains while passing through forested patches after a recent train accident in Chichpalli range that claimed the lives of three bears. Local farmers heading to their fields discovered the dead body of the bear on Wednesday morning and informed forest officials. A team of foresters led by RFO Navegaon range NM Khan reached the spot and removed the dead body for post mortem after inquest formalities. Local wildlife activist BM Lade, who was present at the spot, said that the accident took place 1km from Barabhati railway station between Wadsa-Gondia stretch of the railway line. The bear had severe injury on its snout and head, and had died on the spot. Forest officials suspect that the late night Chanda Fort-Gondia train might have knocked the animal dead. Autopsy carried out at Navegaon range office confirmed death due to injuries sustained in accident. This is the second wildlife accident on this railway track within a week. Earlier, on July 13, a mother bear and its two cubs were killed in similar fashion by Chanda Fort-Gondia train in Chichipalli range. CCF, Chandrapur, Vijay Shelke said they had taken up the matter with railway authorities after the accident. Railway officers have been asked to drive trains carefully and at slow speed while passing through the forest patches on Chanda Fort-Gondia line. Chandrapur forest department is soon going to hold a coordination meeting with railway authorities in this matter, Shelke added. The fresh accident however indicates that railway authorities have taken no notice of the reminders given by the forest department.
