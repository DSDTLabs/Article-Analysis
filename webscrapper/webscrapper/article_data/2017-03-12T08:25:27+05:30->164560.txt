CHENNAI:  , a 41-year-old man from Chennai, was diagnosed with an   that leads to   in the urine 16 years ago. He underwent kidney transplant knowing that he faced the risk of a recurrence. But  , where he underwent the transplant surgery, detected the recurrence early and saved his life.

 They sealed the tubes of the kidney that carry urine to the bladder by giving him drugs before the transplant surgery and kept a tab on the disease since then. When they diagnosed the recurrence on the fifth day after surgery, they gave him a plasma exchange that cleans the blood, injected special antibodies and made modifications in immunosuppressive drugs usually taken after transplantation.
 
 “The sealing of the tubes of the old kidney is a recent development. It is to differentiate if the recurrence of protein loss is due to old or new kidney,” said Dr Rajan Ravichandran, director, MIOT Institute of Nephrology.
 
 Usually when the disease reoccurs soon after transplant surgery, the kidneys are lost and the patient has to go on dialysis. In this case, it was early detection that helped save the patient, he said.
