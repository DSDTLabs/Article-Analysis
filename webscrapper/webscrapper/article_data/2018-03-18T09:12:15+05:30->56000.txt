MADIKERI: The death of another   in   in Kodagu district on Saturday morning took the death toll of jumbos in the district to four in a span of three days. The 15-year-old female elephant that was rescued on Thursday from a slush pond succumbed to dehydration on Saturday morning.

 The elephant was rescued at   village in Rangasamundra in a rescue operation overseen by the Madikeri forest division. Deputy conservator of forests, Madikeri, Manjunath told STOI, “We tried our level best to save it. Doctors provided her with the best treatment.”
 
 Forest department authorities said that the elephant, which got stuck inside a pond inside a plantation, ate nothing after it was pulled out. “It stopped eating, and drinking water from Thursday, and had injuries on its left leg,” said a forest department official.
 
 The officials carried out a postmortem on the elephant’s body, after which it was buried inside the   forest area. The body was transported by a tractor, with the help of elephants.
 
 The death of the young elephant comes close on the heels of the death of three others in Soorikadu village. On Thursday, three elephants died – including a mother and its calf. While the mother elephant was 35, the calf was around five months old.
 
 On the other hand, the death of four elephants in a span of three days has raised the hackles of environmentalists, who want the state government to roll out a concrete action plan to save wild elephants in the Western Ghats. “In the past six months, there have been numerous incidents of wild elephants dying in Kodagu and Hassan. The state government must initiate an immediate action plan to save wild elephants. There is an urgent need to stop  ,” said Suruchi Sukumar, an activist from Madikeri.
