KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur   will be held on February 21, state chief election commissioner J S Sahariya said on Wednesday. 

 With the announcement of the polls, the code of conduct came into force with immediate effect. 
 
 All the political parties, including  , NCP,  , BJP and   have decided to contest the elections on their own. However, the equations may change as the date for filing nomination papers get closer. 
 
 Following the thumping victory in municipal council and president elections in the state, BJP is now expecting to repeat history in the ZP elections, even as Congress is optimistic about retaining power.
 
 The BJP, under the leadership of revenue minister Chandrakant Patil, has already started drawing up a strategy to rope in political bigwigs from other parties. 
 
 The BJP officials have said that stalwarts from other parties are already contacting them and may join the party at a suitable time. 
 
 Congress and NCP are planning to use peopleâ€™s anger against demonetisation of big currencies and its after-effects, mostly hitting the rural parts of the district hard.
 
 Congress and NCP contested the election for 69 seats of ZP in February 2012, with Congress winning 31 seats (including five seats belonging to former city MP Sadashivrao Mandlik). The NCP had won 18 seats, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana of Raju Shetty five, Shiv Sena four and others 11 seats.
 
 Congress came to power by forming an alliance with Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and three independents (total 39 members). The NCP remained in opposition by joining hands with Shiv Sena and eight independent candidates (total 30 members).
