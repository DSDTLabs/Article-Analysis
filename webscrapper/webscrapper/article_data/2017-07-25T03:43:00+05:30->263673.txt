Panaji: Prices of tomatoes continue to peak at Rs 80 per kg, with vegetable vendors fearing this could soar to Rs 100 per kg. For around two weeks now, the price of tomatoes in the state has vacillated between Rs 60 and Rs 100, a vendor said. Director of the agriculture department Ulhas Pai Kakode had told TOI last week that tomato stocks available for sale in the market were low, thereby resulting in exorbitant rates.  “Cultivation of the fresh crop began in June and takes about 45 days to produce fruit. Once the quantity of tomatoes increases in the market, the rates will stabilize,” he had told TOI.
