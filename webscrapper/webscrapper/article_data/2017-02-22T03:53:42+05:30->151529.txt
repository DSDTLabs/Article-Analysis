AHMEDABAD: Ismail Sulaiman Patel, who was arrested on charges of terrorism last year, got bail from courts and is likely to be released on Wednesday from Sabarmati Central Jail.

 Thirtythree-year-old Patel was arrested in February last year in connection with the 2003 Nehrunagar blast case, in which five persons sustained injuries. He was also implicated in another case of terrorism, in which Muslim youths hatched a conspiracy to bomb six Ahmedabad buildings, including Parisima Complex.
 
 In July last year, Patel was denied bail in the case, but later granted bail by   high court. However, he was not released because of his implication in another case. A city sessions court on Monday ordered to release him on bail in the terror conspiracy case, said his advocate Khalid Shaikh.
 
 Patel faces charges of making the circuit for the bomb at his residence in Vadodara that exploded at   on November 12, 2003. Patel argued that he is a resident of   and never lived in Vadodara. 
 
 Moreover, same set of accused was named in both the cases, and they were exonerated in both the cases by trial courts. Two witnesses, who had named Patel in these cases, later turned hostile during their deposition. Therefore, there is little chance of conviction in these cases.
