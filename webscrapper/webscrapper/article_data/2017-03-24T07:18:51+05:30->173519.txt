AMRITSAR: A day after TOI published a report on poor upkeep of the Jallianwala Bagh national memorial, the families of those who were martyred here in 1919, have demanded a say in the management of the monument. Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti (JBSPS) has demanded that the   (JBNMT) be restructured and CBI probe ordered into the alleged embezzlement of funds.

 JBSPS is a body of descendants of those who had died on April 13, 1919. Talking to TOI on Thursday, JBSPS president Bhushan Behal said that the trust should have members from the families of martyrs as they were emotionally attached with the national memorial.
 
 He said stopping of light and sound show and documentary was an ‘insult’ to the brave freedom fighters who gave their lives and laid foundation of nation’s freedom from the British Raj.
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Shwet Malik had raised the issue of shoddy maintenance of Jallianwala Bagh and had demanded probe into the funds given to JBNMT for beginning of light and sound show, to screen a documentary and landscaping.
 
 “Today JBSPS held a meeting and have decided to give a representation to Shwet Malik on the issue of restarting the light and sound show, and initiating a probe into the funds given for the development of national monument and inclusion of our members into the trust,” said Behal.
 
 He said the JBSPS members visited Jallianwala Bagh and found poor sanitation and noticed decaying of walls bearing bullet marks. “This makes a bad impression on tourists who arrive here from far flung places to pay their regards to the martyrs,” he said.
 
 “We will not stop here, if need be we will begin an agitation, take up the issue at national level and even give a representation to Prime Minster,” he said.
