New Delhi: In what is being seen as a breakthrough in curbing the Najafgarh gangwars in southwest Delhi, a special cell arrested a notorious gangster who was at the centre of several killings since last year on Sunday. 

  Nafe Singh alias Mantri carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh and was allegedly the Man Friday of Delhi's top gangster, Manjeet Mahal. The cell had arrested Mahal in December last year.
 
 A special team, led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and  , had been on the trail of Mantri and other key players of the gang for over two years. 
 
 It has been learnt that Mantri had been moving from his hideouts and recently shifted to Morni hills at Panchkula,  . On Sunday, the police got a tip-off that Mantri was headed for Delhi after which inspector   and his team laid a trap and arrested him near Khayala.
 
 "A 0.32bore pistol with five live cartridges were recovered from him. He is wanted in three murder cases and was involved in nine cases in Delhi and Haryana. He was at large for the last two years," said Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (special cell).
 
 Mantri came into spotlight after killing his rival, Sunil alias Doctor, in December 2005. Within few hours, the brother of gangster Jyoti, namely Kapil alias Nandu, and his associates attacked Mantri's house and opened fire at his father, mother and wife. His father died on the spot. 
 
 Within 20 days, Nandu killed the brother and father of Mantri's aide.
