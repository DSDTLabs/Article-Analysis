BHUBANESWAR: To ensure that evicted structures don't come up again on the footpaths, the   (BMC) has   in the evening. 

 In a drive from January 6, the stretch between Airport Square and   was cleared of all the encroachments on pedestrian paths and bicycle tracks. But after eviction, the roadside eatery owners and other vendors again set up their stalls. This prompted the BMC to form a patrolling team to keep tabs on the encroachers on a daily basis. 
 
 "We travel on the 22-km stretch daily. If we find eateries or makeshift shops on the footpaths, we ask them to remove them then and there. This exercise will help us reclaim the dedicated bicycle path," said member of the enforcement squad Harihar Rout. 
 
 The patrolling squad includes police personnel, BMC and   officials. The joint squad will ensure that the non-motorised transport, which is a major component of the smart city development work, becomes a reality. 
 
 Official sources said the major arteries have space for pedestrians and bicycle rider but it is not ensured due of lack of enforcement. After the smart city mission work started, the officials have made it mandatory to clear encroachments. The BDA, which has recently signed an MoU with the   (WRI), a global non-government organisation working for sustainable urban mobility, will get technical assistance from the latter to implement public bicycle sharing (PBS).
 
 This will lead to promotion and use of bicycle on the dedicated paths. Of the four components of the WRI-BDA project, the PBS will be expedited on a priority basis. The WRI will conduct a survey to identify more routes for implementing PBS, official sources said.
