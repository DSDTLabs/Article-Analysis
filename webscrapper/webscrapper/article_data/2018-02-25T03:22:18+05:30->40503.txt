NEW DELHI: Traders in the city have their own plans this  . They will burn sealing effigies instead of holika at 100 major markets across the city. 

 “Adding an innovative turn to the agitation, the markets will remain open till midnight on March 8, whereas the traders will burn effigy on February 28, a day before Holi. They have also decided to take out sealing protest car rallies at different parts of the city on March 4,” Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) statement said.
 
 The decision was taken at a meeting on Saturday attended by leaders of over 100 prominent trade associations from the city. CAIT secretary general,  , said by closing the shops, the traders have demonstrated their resentment many times, but it would be for the first time, when they would open shutters till midnight. 
 
 On February 28, effigies would be put to flame at places, including Chandni Chowk, Karol Bagh, Connaught Place, Sadar Bazar, Kamla Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Green Park, Ashok Vihar, Rajouri Garden, Rohini, Chawri Bazar, Kashmiri Gate, Jail Road, Vikas Marg, Shahdara, Krishna Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Jagatpuri, Khandelwal said. He added that thousands of cars are expected to take part in rallies to be organised on March 4. “It is regretted that even after our constant demand, Kejriwal has not convened a session of the assembly to pass the Bill for protection from sealing. His lip service is irritating the traders,” Khandelwal said. 
 
 Meanwhile, on Saturday, the east corporation sealed 33 units in Vigyan Vihar, Yojna Vihar, Savita Vihar and laxmi Nagar, among others. “Nineteen stilt parking floors in Laxmi Nagar, and 14 properties in other three areas of Shahadra (south) have been sealed for misuse,” EDMC spokesperson said.
