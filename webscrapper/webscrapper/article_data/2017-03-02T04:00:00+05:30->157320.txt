Surat: Though the SMC has accorded a priority to Pandesara GIDC for treat water from the upcoming tertiary treatment plants, the mill owners in this cluster are not too happy with the civic body giving water to the   GIDC too. 

 Several mill owners whom TOI talked to said that Pandesara units require 105 MLD water and they should be getting 40 MLD more from the new plants. They want this daily demand to be fulfilled before any quantity is given to Sachin units. At present, the civic body supplies around 40 MLD water to the textile units in Pandesara from its Bamroli plant.
 
 Pandesara units said that that Sachin is a notified area which does not fall under the purview of SMC. If their demand is accepted, then the Pandesara mill owners will not get the additional 40 MLD water. There are around 100 textile dyeing and printing mills in Pandesara GIDC, whereas the Sachin notified area has less than 55 mills. The Pandesara mills are being supplied with tertiary water since 2014 when the Bamroli plant became operational. 
 
 “We are not against textile mills in Sachin getting water. But we want our additional demand of 40 MLD to be met first and then the SMC should think of giving water to Sachin mills,” said a prominent mill owner. “The civic body has nothing to do with the mills located in Sachin’s notified area. Pandesara mills are within the city limits and we are paying over Rs eight crore in property taxes besides Rs 70 crore a year for water supply,” he said. A senior SMC said, “We are working on the proposal to supply tertiary treated water to textile mills in Sachin. We are adding 40 MLD tertiary treatment capacity at our Bamroli plant”
