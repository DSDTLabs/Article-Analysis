Trichy: The directorate of revenue intelligence seized 19kg of gold worth Rs 6 crore from two people near Jagathapattinnam in Pudukkottai district on Thursday. The gold was allegedly smuggled from Sri Lanka through coastal villages in Pudukkottai. 

 Sources from DRI said that the arrested have been identified as Maruthupandi from Mimisal, coastal village of Pudukkottai, and Selvaraj from Ponpethi village. 
 
 The directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) in Trichy had received a tip-off following which a 11 member team camped at Jagathapattinnam. On observing suspicious activities they split into different groups. 
 
 On Thursday, one of the team detained 2 persons on a motorcycle near Kodakodi for inquiry over suspicious activities and seized from them 19kg of smuggled gold. 
 
 During interrogation, they told the DRI sleuths that they received the gold from two people and were asked to take it to Thondi, where another team would take the gold from them. 
 
 The two have been taken to an undisclosed location in Pudukkottai for inquiry. 
 
 Gold has been smuggled into the country from Sri Lanka in recent years through the coastal districts of Pudukkottai and Rameswaram.
