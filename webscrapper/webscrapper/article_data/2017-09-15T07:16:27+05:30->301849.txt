MUMBAI: A three-and-a-half-year-old male   that had wreaked havoc at   was finally captured at 1am on Thursday at Film City. The leopard had killed a child in July and attacked three children since March at   Colony. The forest department had set up teams and camera traps to capture the leopard.

 “There are several leopards at Aarey. For over a month, we tracked the animals, and through camera traps near the site of the attacks, were finally able to confirm that it is this male leopard that was responsible for the attacks. We scanned the areas that it would roam alone. It is not injured and it used to traverse the entire Aarey Colony, including Film City, State Reserve Police Force camp and Force One area,” said Mayur Kamath, state wildlife warden. The forest ground team followed it for over an hour and put a cage, camouflaged with greenery near the place it frequented, on Tuesday night.
 
 When the animal entered the cage, it was trapped and taken to Sanjay Gandhi Leopard Rescue Centre, he said.
 
 Kamath said the leopard could not be captured earlier due to the availability of easy prey at Aarey Colony. “The place has many stray dogs and pigs. For leopards, these are easy prey, and hence it was difficult to lure the leopard into a cage with the same prey, though we have been keeping a vigil for nearly two months,” he said.
 
 The forest department had set up teams of nearly 15 officers working in three shifts, with three traps each, with a goat tied inside. Kamath, along with a local resident, Imran Udit, who knows the terrain well, had criss-crossed the area several times to confirm which of the leopards was responsible for the attacks.
 
 The camera traps laid at various point showed the presence of cubs at Aarey. “Morning walkers need to be alert. The leopards are active till just before dawn. From camera recordings, we saw walkers who were at Aarey before sunrise being followed by cubs, and they were completely unaware. Many of them do yoga and could be attacked as they are mistaken for prey,” he said.
 
 The leopard will be medically examined to ascertain if it has medical issues. It bore marks of old injuries. It is unlikely to be released in the wild, said sources.
