HYDERABAD: A 32-year-old housewife committed suicide by jumping off the terrace of the nine-storied   building at Abids on Saturday evening. The victim was identified as Alankritha, wife of businessman Vinod Aggarwal from Ramkote. 

 Around 3.00 pm, Alankrita climbed the multi-storied building. After reaching the terrace of the building, she jumped to her death, the Abids police said. Police did not recover any suicide note from the location. The Agarwal couple have a seven-year-old son. 
 
 Police suspect that marital disputes could be the reason for Alankrita’s fatal jump. “The 32-year-old had married Vinod Aggarwal ten years ago. The couple often had quarrels over financial issues. We suspect that financial issues between the couple might have pushed her to take the extreme step,” Abids police inspector A Gangaram said.
 
 Police said they received a call from a passerby, who saw her body lying in a pool of blood on the hotel premises, and alerted them about the incident.. 
 
 After the cops got information about the incident, they rushed to the spot and called CLUES team to inspect the site.
 
 The body was then shifted to the   mortuary for a post-mortem examination. A case was registered under section 174 (suspicious death) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
