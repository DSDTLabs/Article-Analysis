Nazia Khan, 18, who has received a number of national and state awards for her bravery and social work, was recently honoured with the prestigious Bharat Award at the National Bravery Award ceremony held in Delhi. A resident of Agra, Nazia is the only recipient from UP to have won the award â€“ there were a total of 18 children from various parts of the country who were honoured for their acts of bravery by Prime Minister  . 

 
 
 The first act of bravery for Nazia, a BA first-year student, was when she saved an eight-year-old girl from getting kidnapped. She was also instrumental in stopping a bunch of people in her locality from gambling. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Nazia received her Bravery Award in Delhi where she met the PM. She says, "I was seated right in front of him and noticed him smiling at me. While receiving the award, I talked to him when he jokingly called me 'ladaku'. He also met my mother and asked her if I quarrelled with her as well."
 
 After receiving the award, Nazia also participated in the Republic Day Parade with 17 other awardees. She says, "It was an experience of a lifetime to participate in the Republic Day Parade. Every year, I used to watch the parade on television and always dreamt of participating in it. So being there was a dream come true."
