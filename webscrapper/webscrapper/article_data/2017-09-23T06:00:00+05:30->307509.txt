KOLKATA: The Bengal government informed Calcutta high court on Friday that Durga Puja organizers performing ‘shastra puja’ (weapon worship) within private premises need not seek permission from the administration. The court was hearing a petition by  , a priest of the Shree Durga Sevashram, Babupara, Phuleswar Durgabari in Howrah’s Uluberia, complaining that the administration had not responded to applications seeking permission for ‘shastra puja’ on maha ashtami and during sandhi puja. The ritual has allegedly been held at the venue for the past 326 years. 

 After additional advocate general Abratosh Majumder informed the court that no permission was required for performance of the ritual within private premises, Justice   disposed of the petition with the clarification: “Neither the petitioner nor the organizers of the said puja shall perform any part of the rituals relating to the said puja beyond the precincts of the ashram that may adversely affect the law-and-order situation in and around the said ashram in any manner whatsoever.”
 
 Talodhi had approached the high court through counsel Y J Dastoor and Phiroze Edulji after a row erupted over ‘shastra puja’ a few days ago. His apprehensions were sparked by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP)’s announcement that trishuls (tridents) would be distributed among women, for their own protection, before dashami. In reaction to this, chief minister   had warned people in the state against engaging in arms’ worship in public. While VHP had clarified that ‘shastra pujas’ would be held indoors, there was no clarification from the state on whether any permission would be required for this.
