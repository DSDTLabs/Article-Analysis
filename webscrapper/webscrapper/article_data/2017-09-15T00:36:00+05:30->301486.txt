 Bengaluru: Karnataka lacks public healthcare facilities in areas where it needed the most. According to the 2016 Rural Health Statistics report, in a state which has a tribal population of around 34,29,791, the average doctor-patient ratio in PHCs is a shocking 1: 90,000. 
 
 In tribal areas, there are not enough sub-centres, primary health centres (PHC) and community health centres (CHC). And, the existing ones are short on infrastructure and staff.
 
 As per the population norms, plain areas must have a sub-centre, PHC and CHC for every 5,000, 30,000 and 1,20,000 people, respectively. In tribal areas, the number should be 3,000, 20,000 and 80,000. Out of the 171 required PHCs in these areas, only 64 have been set up in the state, and only 38 have a doctor. That means, 38 doctors are treating a tribal population of 34 lakh.
 
 The situation of CHCs is equally worse; out of the 42 required centres, only 7 have been set up. Of the 28 specialists (surgeon, physician, gynaecologist and paediatrician), only 9 were in place at the time of the report. Also, none of the 11 physicians was in the position. 
 
 While 1,143 sub-centres are needed in tribal areas, only 321 are in place. Sub-centres are tasked with providing services in relation to maternal and child health, family welfare, nutrition, immunization and control of communicable diseases but are vastly understaffed. When 321 female and 321 male health workers are needed, only 242 and 69 are working now.
 
 “Most tribal areas overlap with forest areas. In Chamarajanagar, some communities live in and around the tiger reserves. While there’s a PHC in the forest area, it does not have a doctor. There are 9 PHCs here for a tribal population of about 45,000, but only 3 have full-time doctors. In some centres, doctors visit once in one or two weeks. So if there’s no doctor, people have to travel up to 35 km to the nearest centre,” said C Made Gowda, a social worker. 
 
 According to Prashanth N S, additional director of the Institute of Public Health , many people from these communities end up dying of easily preventable causes. “ Anemia, which is the largest cause of maternal mortality among tribal women, can be easily tackled if detected in the earlier stages of pregnancy. But due to lack of medical workers, it gets detected in the last stage,” he said.
 
 According to him, tribals who qualify as doctors might be more motivated and willing to work in these remote areas. “But since the reservation system tends to favour scheduled tribes living in cities and not in these areas, there are very few qualified doctors and nurses from these communities. There hasn’t been a single doctor from Soliga and Jenu Kuruba communities,” he added.

 Specialists ignore remote areas
 
 Most doctors and specialists don’t want to work in tribal areas. We are trying to get them to work with the government either on contract and through an open-bidding process. At PHC level, Ayush doctors are filling up the medical officer vacancies. We have enough PHCs for the rural population, but there has been a mismatch in some areas. For these areas, the government has announced 150 extension clinics. For the tribal population, we have introduced 78 mobile-vehicular units
