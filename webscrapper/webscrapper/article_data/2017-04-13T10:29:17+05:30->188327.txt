NEW DELHI: Pakistan Army’s decision to execute alleged Indian spy   seems to have found little support globally. Not only has   International slammed the decision but also the civil rights groups within Pakistan.
 
  Top US think-tanks have questioned the secrecy of trial and the US NSA visit here next weekend is expected to see some plain speak by India on its ties with Pakistan, hinted people familiar with the developments.
  
  Neighbouring Iran, from where Jadhav has been doing business for over a decade, had earlier snubbed Islamabad for its attempt to drive a wedge between New Delhi and Tehran using the so called “spy card”.
  
  Iran has not supported Pakistan in the ongoing episode. “The death sentence given to Kulbushan Jadhav shows yet again how Pakistan’s military court system rides roughshod over international standards,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia director of Amnesty International.
  
  “What the   has done is to embarrass both the Sharif and the Modi governments,” said a civil activist from Pakistan. Yet another Pak activist described the decision of the military court as a sham and Pakistan military may be using this to seek concessions from Delhi after feeling the pressure over India’s growing support in West Asia and strong opposition to the  .
  
  Officials also referred to the successful visit of Bangladesh PM Sheih Hasina and momentum in BIMSTEC process as factors that have further isolated Pakistan within the South Asian region. There is also an opinion that China may have influenced Pak decision after the Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal.
