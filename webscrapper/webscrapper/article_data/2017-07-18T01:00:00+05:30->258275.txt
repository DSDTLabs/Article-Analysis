While  's dancing skills and stuntbaazi have won appreciation from cinegoers, we hear Hollywood actor   was mighty impressed when he was shown a video of Tiger’s hit number from one of his films.   admits, “Dance has made my career. I have wanted to   ever since I saw Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller' video, but I only started learning it at the age of 21. Nobody believes me when I say that. I was a martial artiste since I was a child and my body language was different. Then, I worked hard and now I have the best of both worlds.”Ask him what drew him to this art form and the actor says, “It’s the loudest form of expression and actions speak louder than words. Even a child can dance. Michael Jackson’s mother said in his biography that the first time the King of Pop showed any talent was when he was very young and would dance to the sound made by the washing machine in their house. Dance is a universal language that anybody can pick up. It’s liberating, therapeutic, it helps you escape and is also a stress buster.
