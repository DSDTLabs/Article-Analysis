NEW DELHI: A   that used to steal the luggage of   has been busted with the arrest of the kingpin and one of his associates. They have been found involved in over 100 theft and   cases at   and inside trains.

 While two of the gang members would pose as ticketless passengers, the gang leader would impersonate a railway official. He would take the unsuspecting passengers to the end of the compartment in the guise of giving them seats, while his associates would flee with their baggage.
 
 The kingpin, Amar Nath alias Bunty (32), and his associate, Mithlesh Kumar Mahto (30), are residents of Sahibabad in Ghaziabad. A stolen motorcycle, five stolen bags containing clothes and other items, a pistol and two cartridges have been seized from them. Over a dozen cases have been solved with their arrest.
 
 The arrests were made after a team of anti-auto theft squad (AATS) of Dwarka district got a tip-off that some criminals carrying firearms would come to Uttam Nagar to commit a serious crime, said DCP (Dwarka) Shibesh Singh.
 
 Bunty was last arrested in a drug peddling case in Ghaziabad. After his release from jail, he formed a gang with Mahto to steal luggage of passengers at New and Old Delhi railway stations.
 
 The gang members would roam at railways stations in pairs in the guise of passengers. They would identify vulnerable passengers who didn’t have confirmed train tickets.
 
  “One of them would befriend the passenger and boast about his contacts in railways. He would offer a confirmed ticket by making the victim speak over the phone with Bunty posing as a senior railways official,” police said.
