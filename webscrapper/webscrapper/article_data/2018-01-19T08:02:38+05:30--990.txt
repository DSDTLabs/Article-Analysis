CHINSURAH: The state department of correctional services is planning to upgrade the security at   district correctional home. The move comes a day after the ruckus at the jail.

 
 The state has ordered a high-level inquiry into the matter. Senior officials at   on Thursday hinted that the entire security of the Hooghly jail might be overhauled.
 
 DG (correctional services) Arun  , who made an emergency visit to the Hooghly correctional home on Thursday, had an hour-long meeting with the jail officials. All aspects concerning the security of the jail were discussed at the meeting.
 
 After the meeting, Gupta said, “We have the security issue in our mind. However, before taking any step, we need to find out how this happened. We are waiting for the probe report.”
 
 When asked why   was brought to Hooghly jail, Gupta said, “It was by an order of the Chinsurah court. On January 20, we will plead before the court again.”
 
 The chinks in the system may have exposed after the incident, but lack of proper security measures in jails was felt last December during a surprise raid by Hooghly police commissioner  . More than 15 mobiles were recovered then, but the administration failed to tighten the security. “There are some hardened criminals in the jail who force other inmates to work for them,” a senior official said.
