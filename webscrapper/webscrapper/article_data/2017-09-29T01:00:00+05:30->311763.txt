GAYA: The district administration has made elaborate arrangements for maintenance of peace during Durga Puja and   that almost coincide this year. Round the clock vigil is being maintained at 24 sensitive points having a history of communal tension.

 Most of the sensitive points are located in Gaya town,   and Sherghati police station areas. Static force deployment has been made at these points. In order to meet the shortage of magistrates, officials from other departments, including engineers, have been vested with magisterial powers.
 
 District magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi said 400 magistrates and about 1500 police personnel of different ranks have been deputed on law and order duty. Altogether 750 puja pandal and 1055   have been issued in the district spread over four sub divisions and 31 police stations.
 
 The DM said strict orders have been issued for following the terms of licence, particularly the route chart and time schedule. “Pandal and Tazia licensees who violate the conditions of the licence would be strictly dealt with,” said the DM. Earlier peace committee meetings were held at district, sub division and police station levels.
 
 In the Muffassil police station area from where reports of communal tension have been received in the past, 16   cameras have been installed. In Gaya town too, besides the regular CCTV cameras, 18 temporary CCTV cameras have been installed at pre-identified points.
