While some people are blessed with naturally long  , for few others, it is not the case.
 
  Batting those long eyelashes not only adds to your appeal, but also makes your eyes look bigger. Though using fake eyelashes is an easy way out, here are some tips...
  
  
 Before you go to bed, apply castor oil, mustard oil or coconut oil on your eyelashes. Do it every day and you can see them grow over a period of time.
  
  
 Take some Vaseline and using an old mascara brush apply it every night. It helps grow your eyelashes.
  
  
 Include Vitamin E supplements in your diet every day to get quick results.
