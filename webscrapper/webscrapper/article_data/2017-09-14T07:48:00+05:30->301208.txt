Rohtak: Two days after a newborn baby went missing from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, under mysterious circumstances; police on Tuesday announced a reward of Rs 50,000 to anyone giving information about the matter.

 Ranju, wife of Shani Kumar, resident of Deri Mohalla, was admitted to the hospital on September 9 where she gave birth to a boy the next evening. The family alleged they were informed few minutes later that the boy had gone missing.
 
 “I went to buy new clothes for my grandson. When I came back, he was missing. The family didn’t even see his face,” Shani’s mother said.
 
 Later, the family created ruckus outside the PGIMS demanding their child back. Police on Tuesday said they had registered a case of kidnapping a minor in the PGIMS police station on Shani’s complaint.
 
 “A probe was conducted by quizzing the staff present in the hospital and relatives but no headway has been made,” the police said.
 
 Talking to reporters, Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Pankaj Nain said an officer of the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) had been ordered to probe the matter and anyone who shared credible information about the newborn would be rewarded with Rs 50,000. The identity of the source would be kept confidential, he added.
