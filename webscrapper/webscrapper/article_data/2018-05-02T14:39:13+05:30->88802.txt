 Police said Balasubramanian, with the help of his three aides, kidnapped the girl on April 29 from Karumandapam and locked up in a house before sexually assualting her. 
 
 Police said the main accused used love as a bait to entrap and harm the victim. Her father lodged a complaint with the Cantonment police on the day and the police launched an investigation based on that. They later found out that Balasubramanian was in a romantic relationship with the girl and was angry when the parents objected to their affair. On Saturday, Balasubramanian with an intention of trapping the girl lured her out of the house, promising her that they could run away for secret wedding.
 
 As the girl was out of the house, he used his three friends to take her to a house where they locked her up, in   mill colony in Perambalur district.
