Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Friday directed the Trichy police to give permission to the AIADMK (Amma) faction headed by TTV Dhinakaran to hold a public meeting in the city against the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET). Justice S S Sundar gave the direction on a petition filed by AIADMK (Amma) Trichy district secretary Srinivasan challenging the police stand of keeping the matter pending.

 When the petition came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel said that the party had decided to hold a public meeting on NEET near Uzhavar Sandhai on September 19. Seeking permission for the same, the petitioner had given representation to the Trichy police. However, the police neither gave permission nor rejected the request and kept the representation pending. Conducting meeting was the fundamental right provided under the Constitution of India, he said.
 
 The government counsel said that Cauvery Mahapushkara festival was taking place in Trichy and many devotees had been thronging the place. Police personnel had been deployed for the festival. Following this, the judge directed the police to give permission and adequate police protection for the meeting. At the same time, the court directed the petitioner to ensure that law and order was not disturbed.
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body has started repair work of the stage at the Uzhavar Santhai ground. Officials said they would complete the necessary repair work before September 19 when TTV Dhinakaran is to hold the anti-NEET rally. Former MLA and TTV Dhinakaran’s supporter from Trichy R Manoharan said that they would erect a stage on the ground if the civic body did not provide it for the event.
