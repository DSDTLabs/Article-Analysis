 "Over the last few years, I've been properly medicated to help symptoms including those, as well as extreme fatigue, metabolism issues, body's ability to retain heat, etc... I was also part of a holistic medical trial that helped my thyroid levels balance out."
 
 
  
 
 Hadid, however, said her diet has remained the same throughout.
 
 "I may be 'too skinny' for you, honestly this skinny isn't what I want to be," she wrote and concluded her statement with: "I will not further explain the way my body looks... Stop putting me in that box just because you don't understand the way my body has matured."
