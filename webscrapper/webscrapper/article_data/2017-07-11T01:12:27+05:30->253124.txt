Thane: Electricity   to around 1,000   patrons from Thane’s   area was curtailed for over 16 hours after a short circuit damaged the   (RMU) of the substation in the wee hours of Monday. The incident was followed by a fault in two underground electric cables which delayed the supply.

 Sources in MSEDCL said that in the first issue, the rain induced high moisture levels entered the RM Unit, thus sparking a short circuit at around 4 am on Sunday and while they had resolved that issue by noon they found a fault in the joint of two underground cables which supplied power to around 1,000 families here.
 
 “We believe that the rainfall over the past few days increased the moisture in the air which probabky entered the unit, leading to a short circuit. The RMU, which helps consumers use two sources of high tension power, was burnt in the process. On finding out about the short circuit, we immediately stopped the power supply to the RMU and began working on fixing it,” said an official.
 
 “However, once we competed the work, we found some issue in the   pressure in two underground cables in the same area. When we dug them up, we found that there was a fault in the joint that connected. The repair work was completed and the electricity to all homes was restored by 8pm,” he added.
 
 This is the second such incident this month.
