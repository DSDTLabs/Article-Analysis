GORAKHPUR: Gorakhpur   on Tuesday cancelled two exams after question papers of them made it to social media hours before the start of exams.

 On Monday, the two papers—scheduled for Tuesday-—became viral on social media. The mathematics exam was scheduled for morning while social work was scheduled for afternoon. A committee under pro-VC   found in its initial investigation that while the mathematics paper was leaked, the social work one did not match the actual examination paper.“Some miscreants tried to create hindrance by circulating the papers on social media. The viral paper of sociology was based on previous years’ papers whereas the mathematics paper matched with the actual paper and it was reported to be leaked. The university didn’t take any risk and decided to cancel both papers,” said university spokesperson  . “The process of FIR against unidentified miscreants has been initiated,” Sinha added.
 
 On the demand by protesting students, he said, “The university has taken the decision of cancellation of papers in favour of students. The VC has appealed to students to be patient and assured them of strict action against the culprits.”
