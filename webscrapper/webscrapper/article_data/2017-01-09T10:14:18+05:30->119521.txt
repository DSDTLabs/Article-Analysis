LUCKNOW:   alias Nankau, 55, would keep aside a part of his daily earnings of Rs 300 for his daughter’s wedding which was scheduled in March. Nankau, who hailed from  , worked as a daily wager and would reach Balu Adda mandi for labourers every morning in search of work. At night, he would take   in the rain basera in Dalibagh.

 A pre-wedding ceremony of Nankau’s daughter was scheduled in his village on Wednesday. But Nankau would never attend it. The poor   was among the five victims who were run over a tipsy driver on early Sunday. 
 
 Nankau’s brother Abdul Salam came to KGMU mortuary on Sunday afternoon to receive his body. “Nankau is survived by his wife, three daughters and three sons. His eldest son does odd jobs to support the family, but Nankau was the main earner,” said Salam. “He was collecting money for his daughter’s wedding and was also trying for a personal loan from the labourers’ supervisor,” added Salam.
