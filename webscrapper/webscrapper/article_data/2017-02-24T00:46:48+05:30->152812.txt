THANE: In spite of the four-way split in the main political parties offering options to the voters, a sizeable number of Thaneites are said to have punched the   option on the EVMs on the polling day, according to preliminary count by the election officers.

 Statistics of the vote count in 10 wards revealed roughly 10,000   went to the NOTA option. 
 
 “I did not find any candidate in my ward eligible to represent my ward and hence I refused to select any of their names,” said a 26-year-old voter from Waghbil.
 
 The NOTA option was introduced in the polling process in 2013 after the Supreme Court, in its verdict, said that the voters have the right to reject the candidates contesting in their respective constituency. tnn
