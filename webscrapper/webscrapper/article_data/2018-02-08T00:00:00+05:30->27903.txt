Musician and   frontman   has been occasionally composing music for   films, and has also acted in a couple. Although, the anecdote about how he landed his next project in Sandalwood, which is Shalini IAS, will probably be one of his most interesting one till date. “This film is a biopic on the life of   officer  , and is an inspiring story to be a part of. It was a gig at the Hampi Utsav that helped me get onboard this project. She was present at my concert there, and she expressed interest to the makers that they should have me onboard. The next thing was that I was approached and I’m now a part of the film,” says Vasu, who also has a few more projects lined up in Sandalwood. Shalini IAS stars   and   in lead roles.
