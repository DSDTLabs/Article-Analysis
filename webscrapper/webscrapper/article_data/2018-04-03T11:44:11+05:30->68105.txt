Bhubaneswar: Wildlife bodies have sought better management of the monkey population after a simian allegedly snatched and fatally dropped an infant in a Cuttack village. Not only should areas that have a large monkey population be identified, they should get enough warning boards. 

 The   (WSO), a private body working on the conservation of wildlife, has sent suggestions to the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife),  , on ways of preventing such human-monkey conflicts in urban spaces. It said vast areas of the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Balasore and Jajpur are prone to incursions by monkeys. In many places in Banki and Athagarh, they cause damage to crops and injure farmers.
 
 "One of the reasons of the growing monkey menace is the availability of easy food. People feed monkeys in many places of worship. In tourist spots such as the Jagannath Temple, Chandikhol, Khandagiri caves, Harishankar, monkeys are everywhere. They have become addicted to the home-made food brought by devotees and tourists," said WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty.
 
 He added that thousands of monkeys often blocked highways near Chowdwar and Angul and on the   road, Ganjam, and Dariginbadi Ghat road in Kandhamal. "They wait for the tourist vehicles to pass so that they can get some food. There are reports of monkeys getting killed in accidents. Then they become revengeful and harm other tourists," Mohanty explained.
 
 The WSO has urged the top wildlife officer to include monkeys in the department's conflict-mitigation plan.
 
 "The wildlife department last week imparted training to some forest personnel on how to tame monkeys and tranquillize them. I have asked senior officers and others to identify monkey-prone areas and plan out a strategy to tackle them," said Tripathy.
