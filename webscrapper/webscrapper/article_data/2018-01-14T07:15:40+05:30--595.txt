PATIALA: In a rare move, district officials in   have transferred as many as 16 teachers, including the principal from the   village school in Nabha to ensure that a dalit girl’s allegations of being discriminated against for her caste can be probed fairly.

 The 17-year-old girl, a topper in her school, had alleged that she faced discrimination for a long time and was even thrashed by uppercaste boys after she refused to help them cheat in a class X board exam in April last year.
 
 Nine months on, numerous inquiries into the allegations were not completed, which is believed to be the reason behind the teachers being shifted out. The final report of the inquiry is yet to be submitted but officials said they took the step to protect the school environment as studies of the students were being affected by the ongoing inquiries.
 
 The video of the dalit girl being thrashed had gone viral in May last year. The girl had filed a complaint with the state schedule caste commission in November following which the first inquiry panel, headed by DSP  , looked into the case. But the panel failed to submit a report.
 
 Another inquiry was conducted by district education officer   who recently submitted a report. But a third inquiry was also ordered by the Patiala deputy commissioner who appointed assistant commissioner (grievances) as the panel head.
 
 Patiala deputy commissioner   claimed that final report is yet to be submitted by the assistant commissioner. “The transfers have been done by the DEO to ensure that the school environment remains hassle-free. This step should not be seen as action against anyone but as a precautionary step,” he insisted. Several politicians have been visiting in the school while a number of activists have also protested in the city.
