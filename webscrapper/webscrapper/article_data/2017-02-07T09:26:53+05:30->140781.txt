RAIPUR: The transfer of alleged serial-killer   Das from Raipur to Kolkata became an issue in itself with   refusing to carry him, stating that they require a formal clearance from the   (BCAS).

 At Swami Vivekananda Airport, Indigo Airlines officials refused to carry Udyan stating that the accused, being a self-confessed murderer, may create a "dangerous situation" for other passengers. They sought permissions from BCAS as also a medical certificate issued by a competent doctor. The airlines did not heed to the West Bengal police's argument they were taking Udyan "at their own risk" and that the accused had to be produced before a court in Bankura district before completion of the transit remand period. 
 
 When contacted by TOI, the local office of Indigo Airlines refused to comment, saying that it was not authorised to speak to the media.
 
 The Bengal police team was on its toes through Monday, and finally managed to get a clearance from BCAS. Later, after a thorough security check and completion of boarding formalities, the accused was flown to Kolkata by Indigo Airlines flight 6E-252 in the evening.
