AHMEDABAD: On Monday, the   ( ) placed road repair bill worth Rs 26 crore before the standing committee for approval. Most of these road stretches are located in the western part of the city — in west and new west zones — where rains have caused maximum damage. 

 The AMC is yet to come out with a consolidated road repair bill for the entire city. Last month, the state government had allocated Rs 75 crore for road repairs ahead of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s visit to Ahmedabad. “The fake-bill scam in bitumen procurement was unearthed from west and new west zone wards. We suspect more roads may have been damaged because of inferior quality material or poor construction,” a senior AMC official said. “Road construction projects have to take off if the Indian Road   standards are to be maintained.” 
 
 After the July rains, more than 202km of city roads were washed away, leaving 4,500 potholes. Only 18km of roads were under the liability period for which contractors have to pay for repairs.
