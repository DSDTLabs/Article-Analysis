GURUGRAM: Power   were reported from several areas of the city on Saturday as rise in temperature led to an increase in demand. 

 Residents said   occurred mostly during mornings and afternoons. Meanwhile, power discom   estimated that this year demand may go beyond 300 lakh units per day. 
 
 Residents of Sushant Lok 2, Palam Vihar, DLF 4 and surrounding areas complained that outages became frequent over the last two days.
 
 “There have been 2-3 hours of power outages in Sushant Lok 2 and they have become regular again,” said Sanchit  , a resident. 
 
 “Why did we have the ‘preventive maintenance’ shutdowns by DHBVN in preparation for the summers? Furthermore, it’s difficult getting through their helpline and then the complaint lodged is promptly closed and reflected as ‘resolved,’ although it isn’t actually. There is certainly a disconnect between the ground level personnel and SDO office,” Verma added.
 
 Residents said when they call officials, they either don’t take calls or inform them that there has been a fault in the power house. Discom also came under fire recently when rains triggered massive power crises in the city as practically every sector reported mid-night outages with some complaining they had to sit through the entire night waiting for electricity to come back.
 
 “Five-six hour long outages have become a normal occurrence here,” said  , a resident of DLF 4.
 
 TOI spoke to discom officials who said that these outages happened locally at the transformer level. “If there is a feeder level outage, we will inform cosnumers it a day earlier,” said K C Aggarwal, superintendent engineer, new Gurgaon circle.
