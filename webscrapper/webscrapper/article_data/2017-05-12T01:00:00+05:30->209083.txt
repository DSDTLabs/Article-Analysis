Justin Bieber’s exit from Mumbai was as hush-hush as his arrival on Wednesday at 1.30 am. While it was speculated that he would tour India for a few days, it came as a surprise when he left for South Africa soon after his concert in   the same night. 

 The hype around his visit turned out to be a damp squib, as he skipped all the plans chalked out for him, including attending high profile parties. 
 
 A source revealed, “Justin reached the concert venue at 7.55 pm, was on stage at 8.10 pm and made a backdoor exit at 9.45 pm. He headed straight to the Kalina airport, from where he boarded his private jet to  , where he will perform on May 14. He chose to travel by road both ways, though a chopper was kept on hold for him.” 
 
  
  
 However, in what turned out to be a hurried 22-hour visit to India (since he extended his stay in Dubai), the pop star managed to soak in the sights and sounds of Mumbai as much as possible. 
 
 The source adds, “Before heading for his concert, Justin went to the slums in   and   (in Govandi), accompanied by security in-charge   and his personal bodyguards. He interacted with underprivileged children and played football with them. He also visited the Deonar dumping ground and finally, headed to a shopping mall in Navi Mumbai, where he grabbed a drink at an American coffee shop. He even visited the Gateway of India at 4 am on Wednesday morning but that’s all he could manage in a day’s time.” 
 
 While Justin crooned to his hit song, 'Let Me Love You', at the concert, he didn’t give Mumbai enough time to love him back.
