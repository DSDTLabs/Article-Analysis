KOLKATA: Overnight showers and a steady morning drizzle halted traffic and led to waterlogging in pockets of the city on Saturday morning. Even though the rain ceased by 10.30am, several streets remained under water till late in the afternoon. Sunday could be rainy as well with the showers getting heavier, courtesy a cyclonic circulation, predicted the Met office. On Saturday, the city received 64.7mm of rain.

 July has been an exceptionally wet month with Kolkata already receiving 52% more rain than normal. 
 
 A cyclonic circulation brewing over south Bangladesh, Gangetic   and north Bay of Bengal could trigger more rain over the next 48 hours, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Heavy showers could lash the city on Sunday in case the circulation turns into a low-pressure, said weathermen. 
 
 “The showers could get more intense since there is a strong possibility of the cyclonic circulation turning into a low-pressure over the next 48 hours. If that happens, Kolkata will receive heavy rain on Sunday. The western districts, including Purulia, Bankura and  , will also receive heavy rain,” said GK Das, director, RMC.
 
 The showers could relent in Kolkata from Monday. But the western districts will continue to be lashed by heavy showers under the impact of the low-pressure system, added Das. 
 
 Till July 21, Kolkata has received 610.9mm of rain, which is 17% higher than the seasonal normal. This month, the city has received 370.9mm of rain, which, too, is around 52% in excess.
 
 Apart from the circulation, the monsoon trough also remained active in the region, added RMC sources. The rain could be sporadic if the low pressure doesn’t form.
