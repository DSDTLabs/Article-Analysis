Trichy: The city corporation has collected Rs 2.57 lakh as penalty in the last seven months from residents and commercial establishments who have been flouting segregation of waste at source rule before handing them over to sanitary workers during door-to-door waste collection. 

 The civic body officials have been provided with mobile point of sales (MPOS) to levy spot fine on residents between Rs 10 to Rs 2,000 for offences violating by-laws of the Trichy Corporation and solid waste management rules.
 
 The android application enabled spot fine collection system was introduced by the corporation in October 2017 in all four zones. Seven months after introducing the facility, the civic body said that Rs 2.57 lakh was collected as penalty exclusively from residents and commercial establishments for failing to segregate waste as biodegradable and non-biodegradable at source. 
 
 Around 100 MPOS devices were said to be in use by sanitary officials and junior engineers across the 65 wards of the corporation. Fine will be levied on 11 offences including burning of plastic waste, nurturing dengue source, dumping garbage on streets, open urination and dumping debris in public spots. Residents can pay using debit and credit cards apart from cash. 
 
 “Officials were informed to monitor frequent violators refusing to segregate waste at source and collect penalty up to Rs 500 per offence from them to ensure adherence,” an official added. It is said that commercial establishments and residents caught dumping waste in vacant plots will be levied a penalty ranging between Rs 500 to Rs 2,000.
