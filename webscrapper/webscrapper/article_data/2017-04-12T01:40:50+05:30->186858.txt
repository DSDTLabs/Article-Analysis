NOIDA: Nilgais (blue bulls) dying in road accidents has become commonplace along the 130-metre-wide road from Noida to Greater Noida. With at least two car accidents every week reported from the highway, the local villagers from   region have appealed to the   to set up cautionary signage for the awareness of drivers plying the route early in the morning or late in the evening. Farmers of Greater Noida often complain of nilgais invading the farmland and destroying crops. 

 These nilgai, according to   information, usually try to access the water sources in Surajpur region.
 
  These animals are frequently mowed down by speeding vehicles.
 
 The forest department has requested the Greater Noida Authority to increase the number of the cautionary signboards along the highway. “The forest department cannot put up signboards anywhere. We have put up signage but there is a need for making these boards more prominent. We have requested the Greater Noida Authority to increase their number. We also need speedbreakers at road crossings, where the nilgais are most vulnerable while crossing the road at those points,” district forest officer H V Girish told TOI.
 
 Vikrant Tongad, an activist from Bhanota village who has made the appeal to GNIDA, said, “The boards need to be prominent. There has to be an awareness among the people using this road. When they see an animal crossing a road, they should honk from a distance. Each week we hear of at least one or two  . Some of them are taken for medical treatment, but most are just left to die in the neighbouring fields.”
