LUDHIANA: Dumping of garbage on   across the city has irked city residents, who complain of foul smell, spread of diseases and stray animals. It is common to see garbage dumped across the city, even in posh areas like   and Model   Residents say repeated complaints to authorities and area councillors have not been heeded.

 Haibowal resident Gurpreet Singh said many plots in Haibowal are lying vacant and residents dump garbage there. He said the menace leads to the spread of diseases, particularly in the summer, when there are flies buzzing around. Besides, he said, it encourages the stray dog menace.
 
 Dugri resident Ashish Kumar asked authorities to take stern action and advised residents to act responsibly by refraining from dumping garbge in the open. Residents said MC should not only pressurize owners to clean their plots by imposing penalties but also impose fine on residents dumping garbage on vacant plots.
 
 MC health officer Dr   said the civic body takes action and issues challans for littering whenever they get a complaint against people dumping garbage or against plot owners who fail to get their plots cleaned. Often, he said, residents have no clue about people and property owners dumping garbage and residents also fail to bring proof, due to which authorities fail to take action. He said if anyone faces trouble due to dumping of garbage, they can complain to the MC and action will be taken against violators.
