ANNAVARAM: If all progresses as per plans, then one can soon see foreign tourists interested in   tying the knot at the Sri Veera   temple at Annavaram in  .

 Just like Rajasthan's   sees many foreigners taking the saath pheras á la Indian style, plans have now been mooted to bring such international couples to Annavaram temple and make it an international marriage destination. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was recently signed between private player Prannit Nissankara and the AP tourism department in this regard. Besides the temple, the idea is to promote tourism in and around Annavaram, East Godavari district and adjacent districts including Visakhapatnam.
 
 Prannit Nissankara, the brain behind the project said, “Recently , we inked an MoU with the tourism department at the CII summit. We want to divert foreign tourists from Jaipur to Annavaram as the temple is considered auspicious for newly-married couples or even for marriage. It is believed that after marriage in the temple, if the couple conducts certain rituals and Satyanarayana vratam, the conjugal bonding would last lifelong. “ Another benefit of making Annavaram the international marriage destination would be boosting tourism and culture in the surrounding areas.
