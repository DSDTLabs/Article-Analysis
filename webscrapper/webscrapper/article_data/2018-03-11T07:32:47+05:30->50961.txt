 On January 2, 2016, the   (GRP) had arrested 25-year-old Ashish under Section 22, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act with medical drugs.
 
 On that day, ASI Palwinder Singh along with other cops of GRP had been present on the eastern side of platform numbers 2 and 3 at   in connection with checking of suspected persons. At about 12.30 pm, a person was seen coming from the Ladhowal side carrying a backpack.
 
 On seeing the police party, he tried to flee but was caught by the police. On checking, GRP found 18 strips of rexogesic injections with each packet containing five injections (total of 90 injections) and 90 injections of Avil (R).
 
 The additional public prosecutor for the state pleaded for punishment for the accused for having committed the heinous crime of carrying commercial quantity of Rexogesic injections. He contended that he has proved the case against the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence and chemical examination report of the recovered consignment.
 
 The defence counsel had also contended that case property was not deposited by SHO on the same day with MHC and remained in his custody and therefore, the possibility of tampering with the same cannot be ruled out.
 
 But the court observed that this argument of the defence counsel is of no avail.
 
 Defence counsel had also contended that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case against the accused as no independent witness ever joined the case despite availability. On the basis of evidence in the record, the court held that there was a fair attempt to make independent witness join the case but none came forward.
