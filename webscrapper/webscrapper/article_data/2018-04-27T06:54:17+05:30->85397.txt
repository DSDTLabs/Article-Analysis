HYDERABAD: In what appears to be a clear violation of   orders, the family of a co-option member of the   (GHMC), G  , recently erected two statues of her 17-year-old son who died seven months ago. The statues of G  , which came up over the last 10 days, are located alongside the Alwal Main Road and Old Awal Crossroads respectively.

 In 2013, the SC took objection to this practice and ordered all state governments and Union Territories to deny permission for erecting statues.
 
  
  
 Condemning the violation of the Supreme Court ruling, a RTI activist from the area, on Thursday, shot a letter to  , minister of municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) urging him to take strict action against the family.
 
 “If they want to build something in their son’s memory they should build a memorial on private land, in his remembrance. I request the MAUD minster to ensure that the statues are removed. I also request him to instruct the GHMC officials as well as his workers to not flout norms,” said P M Sai Prasad, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader and RTI activist. 
 
 Other residents of Alwal too raised objections over the statues with a senior citizen ruining how the statue located at Alwal main road is obstructing smooth traffic flow. “The Alwal main road is a highway and the statue is creating hindrances for motorists. There is also a proposal for widening of the road and hence the statue should be removed immediately,” the senior citizen said.
 
 Members of the Goud family, in their defence said that Akhil’s statues were erected as he was a part of Telanagna movement since his childhood. “My son actively participated in all programmes organised by the   before the state was formed,” said his father G Srinivas Goud.
 
 When questioned about traffic issue, he added that the family was willing to remove them if they were inconveniencing people. “We will shift the statues inside the compound wall of our establishment shortly,” said Srinivas Goud.
