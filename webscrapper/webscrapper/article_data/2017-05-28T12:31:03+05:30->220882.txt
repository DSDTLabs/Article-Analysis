VASCO: The   ( ) is leaving no stone unturned to make all areas under its jurisdiction   free.

  While 19 of its 25 wards have been declared free of open defecation, the civic body is facing some hurdles in its remaining six wards. Teams are being sent to these places to create awareness and promote healthy habits. 
 
 MMC chief officer Deepali Naik said there have been occasions when the teams have had to wait for people answering to nature’s call in the open, to greet them and urge them to change their habits. Naik said, “In some of these areas people defecate in the open despite proper facilities being available, just because they are used to it. These cases are more common in areas like   and Baina.” 
 
 To promote healthy habits, the civic body has taken up several important steps, one of them being the 50% discount on group sewerage connections. 
 
 Naik said, “If applicants come in big groups of at least 10 members, they are being offered a 50% deduction in fees. We have received applications from three such groups.” 
 
 The initiative has been applauded by governor Mridula Sinha.
