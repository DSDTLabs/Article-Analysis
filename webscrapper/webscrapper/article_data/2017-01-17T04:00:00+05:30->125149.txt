Ahmedabad: Banaskantha police have given a clean chit to state health minister Shankar Chaudhary in connection with allegations that he is holding a bogus MBA degree and has falsely mentioned his qualification in his nominations during the 2012 assembly elections.

 Complainant Farsu Goklani, a social worker, filed a criminal complaint before cops seeking a probe and demanding Chaudhary’s disqualification for being a legislator on the ground that his MBA degree was not from a recognized institute. 
 
 In his couple of litigations before the Gujarat high court, he had demanded that Chaudhary should be disqualified under section 125A of Representation of People Act.
 
 The HC had asked him to make the complaint before appropriate authorities. He approached the police later. In a reply to Goklani, Palantpur LCB inspector J H Sindhav said that Goklani’s complaint was barred by time limitation, because a complaint under RP Act needs to be filed within six months of any alleged commission of offence.
 
 Besides, the police said that the minister cleared his SSC exams in 1987 and HSC exams in 2011. He obtained his MBA degree in 2012 from a private institute on basis of a diploma in business administration that he had obtained in 2007. 
 
 Hence, the allegation of having a bogus degree on part of the minister does not hold any water, the police reply reads.
 
 Reacting to the clean chit to Chaudhary, Goklani said that he would challenge the police’s report before the high court.
