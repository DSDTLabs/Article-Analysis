The   beach clean-up completed a year on Sunday. The initiative started by  , a young businessman from Dadar who has made it his mission to make it a plastic free beach.   who in his childhood days used to come and play at beach was disheartened to see how the beach has turned out ugly and filthy, "People are throwing all sort of trash in the sea like polythene bags, garlands, idols of gods, waste, and what not and but because the sea can't digest all of this, it comes to sea shore leaving the beach looking very filthy," says Jay.

  
 While he started working alone on his mission initially, he is no joined in by like-minded people and slowly he has built his team. "I have engaged corporates, schools, publication houses in this beach cleaning drive and due to our consistent efforts we are able to accomplish the mission. My mission is not only to clean the beach but to create awareness among people to nurture our environment." 
 
  
 Celebrities like Ankush Chaudhari,  ,  ,  , Santosh Juvekar, Prajakta Mali, Pooja Thombre have joined in the cause showing genuine concern towards restoring the beauty of our beaches. After the cleanup drive conducted for the entire year, the difference is quite visible on the beach. "We have cleared more than 500 tons of plastic and other trash from Dadar beach in this span. The beach looks much cleaner today as compared to when we started last year. More and more people and kids have started turning up in the beach for fun and leisure," concludes Jay.
