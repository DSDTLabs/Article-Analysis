PANAJI: In a major move to increase the state’s revenue collection through casinos, the government on Tuesday hiked various licensing fees by up to 4.5 times. The order issued by the finance department will come into force from April 1. Goa has six offshore   and nine land-based casinos, and the increase will boost the annual revenue by approximately Rs 150 crore.

 “We are yet to get an official intimation about the hike in various fees for casinos. We will react once we get the details,” director Casino Pride   said.
 
  
  
 
 The annual recurring fee for offshore casino vessels with passenger capacity of over 400 has been hiked 3.5 times, which means the new fee stands at Rs 40 crore as against the existing Rs 12 crore. The hike in the same fee for other casinos vessels ranges between 2.5 and 4.5 times. For offshore casinos with passenger capacity above 200 and up to 400 the fee has been hiked to Rs 30 crore a year as against existing Rs 11 crore whereas for vessels with passenger capacity up to 200 it has been increased to Rs 25 crore from the earlier Rs 10 crore a year.
 
 The transfer license fee has also been upped. For onshore casinos, this has been increased to Rs 30 crore from Rs 10 crore while for offshore casinos the new fee stands at Rs 50 crore from the present Rs 20 crore.
 
 In the case of licence application fee, the hike for both categories of casinos — offshore and onshore casinos — is the same, from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.
 
 Licence renewal fee for both categories of casinos has been raised to Rs 1 crore from Rs 30 lakh. 
 
 The increase in non-refundable security deposits at the time of grant of new licence stands at Rs 50 lakh as against the exiting Rs 20 lakh, while the amount to be paid during renewal has been increased to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh. 
 
 Licences of offshore casinos expires on March 31, a source said, adding that the government has proposed to extend these by another six months.
