Gurgaon: Over 150   and residents of old Gurgaon staged a protest on Monday to shift a   site near Civil Lines to the outskirts.

  “This site is situated close to a school. Many students fall sick during rainy season as   breed here. It seems that old Gurgaon has become a dumping site for the corporation,” said Sanjay Singh, a shopkeeper.
 
 Garima Yadav (12), a student, said, “We don’t feel like coming to school as it stinks all the time because of the waste dumped here.”
 
 A representative from Manav Awaaz, an   working in the area, said, “We have been raising the issue with authorities for a very long time. However, no action was taken.” 
 
 City-based doctors extended their support to the residents. “The concept of waste dumping in the open is itself illegal. Such sites pose major health hazards. Mosquitoes breed here and can cause many diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and dengue,” said Dr Jayant Sahni.
 
 Residents alleged that authorised contractors dump waste in this site after sunset, however, an   official said, “The waste is being dumped by the residents. No authorised contractor can dump waste like this.”
