CHENNAI: Shifting the blame for failing to produce electricity at the biomethanation plant at the Koyambedu wholesale market complex,   claimed improper power supply from   and non-provision of project escalation cost by the   as reasons behind their damning assessment in the HC-appointed advocate commissioner's report.

 Ramky is responsible for solid waste collection, processing and disposal. In January 2016, an advocate commissioners team audited the solid waste operation and submitted a report accusing Ramky of wrong doing, which TOI had reported on May 2. Ramky presented documents to TOI showing power generation at the plant from 2010 till now, barring a period between 2011 and 2012, which the firm's representatives said was due to the plant malfunctioning. “We were not given the time and space to explain elaborately when the audit was done. They prepared the report based on CMDA 's information,“ said S D Venkatesh, general manager, Ramky.
 
 Ramky claimed that power generated from the unit was being fed to the TNEB's grid on a daily basis and that they had not received payment for the generated power over the last four years.
 
 “We need to be paid Rs 8 unit of power generated, according to the agreement. The payment is split in half with the CMDA,“ said A Srinivas, project manager, Ramky. Sources in   quashed the argument.
 
 “We have no power purchase agreement with Ramky. They wheel the generated power to CMDA. The payment should come from CMDA,“ a senior official said.
