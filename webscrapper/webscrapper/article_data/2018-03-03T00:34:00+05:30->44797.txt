Coimbatore: The city corporation is blaming manpower scarcity and the delimitation process after finding that its property tax revenue went down by 13% this fiscal. According to the revenue department officials of the corporation, the target for the financial year 2017-2018 was Rs 150cr, Rs 11cr more than the previous year. “We conducted a lot of drives such as property reassessment to meet the target. We also made adequate collections. But, last year, due to demonetisation, the collection was much higher than this year,” said a senior official. In 2017, the corporation had collected Rs 127cr. This year, so far, it has collected only Rs 123cr. Among the zones, the least amount was collected from the south zone, where only 45% of the Rs 29cr target has been achieved. In the west zone, the highest collection of 66% has been made of the target of Rs 40cr. While 64% of Rs 46.8cr target has been collected from the east zone, 61% of Rs 56.12cr has been collected from the central zone and 64% of Rs 37.41cr has been collected from the north zone. The corporation officials have employed more than 35 office assistants from the corporation main building and other assistant and administrative staff from zonal offices on a collection drive. “We have handed over the arrear list to them and they are going from door-to-door to improve collection,” said a senior corporation official. The officials have also disconnected more than 16 water connections and have begun placing garbage bins in front of commercial establishments to make them pay. “We are sure that within another month, we will improve our collection,” said an official. The reduction is not just because of the de-limitation process, but also because of the increased target, said an official. “We will definitely improve the collection by March31,” he added.
