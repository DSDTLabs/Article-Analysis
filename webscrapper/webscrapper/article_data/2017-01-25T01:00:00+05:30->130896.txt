It’s a big fight at the box office this week with the midweek release of ' ' and ' ' and the Republic Day  . A clash was anticipated, with both production houses fighting for more screens, but nobody could have guessed that they would refuse to accept even one screen less than the other. While multiplexes decided to go ahead with equal numbers, single screens preferred 'Raees' over 'Kaabil' at some places.

  
  Big fight for screens behind the scenes
 
 Talking about the clash of the two films, an exhibitor told us, “We were ready for this big fight at the box office. But what we had not anticipated was that both production houses would not accept anything less than equal number of screens. Most of the exhibitors were unable to figure out how to allot equal shows to both the films till Tuesday afternoon.”
 
  Another exhibitor told us, “A big fight for screens is happening behind the scenes. We had to prepare and then cancel schedules several times because no one production house was ready to accept fewer screens. Dangal is still running in cinemas and is doing well, but we will have to reduce its shows to screen these two big-budget films now. We had thought of dividing screens and shows judiciously, but this pressure is too much to deal with and we are going ahead with equal number of shows and screens for both the films.”
 
  However, the exhibitors told us that if one movie slips back in popularity, they will change the numbers. But for now, they are going ahead with equal screens and shows.
