Ahmedabad: A lawyer from Vadodara unsuccessfully fought a nine-year legal battle, going up to New Delhi, for a mobile service provider’s decision to debit Rs 22.54 from his account.

 Girish   was a subscriber to the mobile service of Airtel Pvt Ltd. In 2008, he recharged with a coupon costing Rs 75 for talk time of Rs 50. He claimed he had a balance of Rs 6.70 in his account. After the recharge, when he used the service, he got a message showing a negative balance of Rs 22.54. Surprised with the debit and in protest, he dragged the service provider to consumer court and demanded Rs 75,000 in all for damages and mental agony.
 
 The Vadodara’s Consumer Dispute Redressal   rejected Motwani’s complaint with the observation, “This is a vague matter and it wastes the time of court and other advocates who are standing in the queue for long for justice.” The State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission also rejected his complaint in April last year.
 
 Motwani approached the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, New Delhi (NCDRC) against the lower courts’ decisions. The company asserted that the minus balance of Rs 22.54 was not illegally shown, but the lawyer had actually used the talk time. In fact, he never bothered to inquire with the company how the amount was deducted and never inquired about the talk time used.
