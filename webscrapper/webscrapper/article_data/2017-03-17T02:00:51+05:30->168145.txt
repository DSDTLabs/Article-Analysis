PATNA: The caste and socio economic census (CSEC) data of at least 2,500 of Bihar’s 8,463 panchayats got mixed up, resulting in delay in the implementation of PM Awas Yojana and other welfare schemes.   This was stated by state rural development department minister Shrawan Kumar, while giving the government’s reply to the House debate in the state assembly on the Rs 5,717.48- crore budgetary demand of his department for 2017-18.    Though a cut motion had been moved by BJP MLA Arun Kumar Sinha, the assembly passed the Budget by voice vote after the BJP-led opposition MLAs walked out of the House.    Kumar said the state informed the Centre about the data mix-up and also about the need to include thousands of families which had been left out of the below poverty line (BPL) list. The state also requested the Centre to allow rectification of these two lapses, but the Centre rejected the government’s proposal in December last year, he added.    The CSEC and the BPL list preparation work were conducted in the state in 2011, for which the rural development department was the nodal agency. “The errors have to be removed to ensure that the benefits of welfare schemes reach the families that have been left out,” the minister said.    He also said the Centre had not yet released Rs 294 crore to be paid as wages to labourers and another Rs 158 crore for meeting the cost of other components under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Schemes. The state has also urged the Centre to up the wage from Rs 177 per head per day as it did not match with the market rate.    According to the minister, the state has seen massive empowerment of families as the government formed 5.8 lakh self-help groups in all the 534 blocks, and the number will be increased to 8.5 lakh families in 2017-18 under the Jeevika programme.
