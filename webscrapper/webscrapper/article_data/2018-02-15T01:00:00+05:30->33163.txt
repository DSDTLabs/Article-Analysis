Their pairing was much talked about in ' ' and now,   and   are all set to take it a notch higher in the upcoming multi-starrer comic-caper, Welcome To New York. In fact, a song from the film — Nain Phisal Gaye — which released recently, has not only been appreciated for its lyrics and music, but also their crackling chemistry. The track features Sonakshi, who plays a Gujarati fashion designer, taking her muse Salman’s measurements. It offers a glimpse of his character’s naughty and funny side, as she serenades him with a measuring tape in hand. The superstar will be seen in a cameo in the movie, which has   paired opposite Sonakshi.

 Director Chakri Toleti says, “It was really easy to shoot Salman and   together because they have always shared great on-screen chemistry. Also, they enjoy working with each other.”
 The movie revolves around two Indian youngsters (Sonakshi and Diljit), who are in search of a better life. However, an unexpected trip to New York City sets them off on a comic adventure, which changes their lives forever.
 
 Welcome To New York, produced by Pooja Films and Wiz Films, releases worldwide on February 23.
