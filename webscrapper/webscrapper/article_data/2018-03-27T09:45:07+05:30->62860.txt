LUCKNOW: BSP Supremo   has directed her party cadre to start preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, keeping in mind that their agenda should be to ensure that an "anti-Dalit and anti-minority" BJP does not come back to power. Mayawati's statements came in the backdrop of PM  's 'Mann ki Baat' on Sunday where he attempted to reach out to farmers and Dalits. 

 Addressing zonal coordinators in Lucknow on Monday, Mayawati lashed out at BJP for using the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao   for political gains while ensuring that dalits and minorities were pushed back further from development. 
 
 The latest example of BJP's ant-Dalit and anti-minority ideology, she said, was reflected in the   elections where it used all its might to ensure victory for its rich candidate against Ambedkar's namesake who was the BSP candidate.
 
 "In the past four and a half years years, you (Modi) have done enough drama over Dalits and backward classes and you are no longer going to get any more political mileage from it. Baba Saheb's vision of the development of an equal state and humanist thought cannot happen under BJP and RSS and company. This is because BJP's ideology is very different from the ideology of Ambedkar, is opposed to the objective of the Constitution, and is narrow, communal and casteist," she said.
 
 Mayawati further accused BJP of making the   redundant, as it had allegedly done with dalit reservation, saying that BJP's anti-dalit mindset was clear from incidents like the Rohit Vemula case of   and harassment of dalits in Una and Saharanpur.
 
 She reiterated that her "nazdeeki" with SP forged just before the Rajya Sabha election was intact despite BJP's best efforts.
