HYDERABAD: Polluting industries would be shifted outside the   (ORR) limits and   in a phased manner, industries minister   said in the   on Wednesday. He said about 500 industries, which are categorised as Red and Orange, would be relocated soon. "Of the 1,234 industries that were proposed to be shifted, 100 industries will be shifted outside ORR limits within three months and 400 industries, especially bulk drug units, will be moved to the new Pharma City coming up at  , after obtaining environmental clearance from the Centre," KTR said. 

 Replying to various queries in the Assembly, KTR said nine locations have been identified for shifting these polluting industries. But before shifting the industries, common effluent plants need to be constructed by the government for treating the waste. He admitted that some industries were dumping their effluents in nalas and lakes illegally and closure notices were issued to 13 such industries.
 
 "Special teams were formed jointly by municipal corporation, pollution control board and police to prevent illegal dumping in nalas and lakes. Surveillance on industrial areas -   and   - has been stepped up. If needed, corporates would be roped in under corporate social responsibility for arranging man power for surveillance," he said.
