CHANDIGARH: The late night blaze that broke out at PU’s Administrative Block on May 13 night was accidental, and no employee or outsider was involved in it, revealed an inquiry report tabled in Saturday’s meeting of the varsity’s second-highest governing body, the syndicate.

 The document tabled in the meeting was an interim report of the fact-finding committee formed by the university to find out the reasons behind the fire. The committee is chaired by Justice JS Narang, a former judge of the   and   high court. Though the report was tabled, syndicate members did not discuss its contents and referred it for the next meeting.
 
 Decks were also cleared for improving management of space at the university. The syndicate okayed guidelines that set a time limit of a month for re-employed facilty to vacate their office space after their tenure is over. 
 
  vice-chancellor Prof A K   had formed a committee for framing the guidelines, after almost all departments of the university had complained of shortage of office space. The fresh rules will be applicable to all departments and centres on PU campus.
