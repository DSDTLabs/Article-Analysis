KOLKATA: The gap between male and female child   rates has reduced considerably in Bengal, propelling the state to the list of the best five Indian states in terms of this key developmental index.

 The latest Sample Registration Survey (SRS 2016) has found 28 deaths per 1,000 among girl children in the 0-4 age group, and 27 among boys. This is a huge improvement: the 2011 figure was 40 and 37 respectively, with the girls’ mortality rate showing a remarkable drop.
 
 The narrowing-down of the gap is a boost to the larger goal of gender equality. “This is very good not only in terms of social consciousness, but also in terms of preparing a gender-equal strong workforce,” said economist Mrityunjoy Mohanto. “The figures speak of a growing consciousness — that girl children are no more outcasts. We can finally hope to head towards a gender-equal society.”
 
 Sociologist Prasanta   was more reserved in comment. “This is definitely a very good sign, but it is too early to say whether it will bring about social change,” he said. 
 
 Roy said, “The decline in mortality rate of children in the 0-4 age-group shows social consciousness but at the same time the increase of dowry death and rape indicate that this consciousness is yet to percolate deep inside the social fabric. Yet, it can be said that it is a silver lining.”
 
 Bengal shares the top-five slot with   (with a child mortality gender gap of 1), Gujarat (-1, indicating more boys died there than girls), Odisha (2) and   (0).
 
 The SRS 2016 results, senior health department officials point out, don’t come as a surprise. Last year, another survey by the Union health and family welfare ministry in 13 states and two Union Territories had indicated that child mortality rate (per 1,000 children) in Bengal has come down to 27 from 48. Unlike SRS 2016, however, this NHFS-4 survey showed a decadal variance since the earlier such survey, the NHFS-3, was done in 2005.
