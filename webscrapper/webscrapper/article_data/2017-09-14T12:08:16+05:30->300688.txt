JAISALMER: A Dalit gang-rape survivor on Tuesday committed suicide in   following inability of the police to nab the culprits and continuous pressure on her to go for a compromise on the issue. 

 The victim had met Barmer SP twice and had asked for protection stating danger to her life. The victim in her memorandum submitted to SP had mentioned that as culprits were not caught, she was continuously getting threats of killing her. At the same time, the culprits were also building pressure on her to compromise and she was quite disturbed. The father-in-law of the deceased has lodged a case against five persons. After the incident, people of the community reached hospital and staged a protest. All efforts to pacify the family went in vain as family refused to take the body on Wednesday and post-mortem could not be conducted.
 
  MLA   has sat on dharna to provide justice to the victim for the last two days.
 
 According to information, one-and-a half months ago, a Dalit woman at Booth rathodan village in chauhatan police station area in Barmer was raped by few people.
