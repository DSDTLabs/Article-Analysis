Jamshedpur: A two-member panel comprising of Kolhan commissioner and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, who are investigating the   cases of nine people and subsequent flare-up on the streets, visited Mango locality on Friday.

 Commissioner   and DIG Prabhat Kumar toured the Mango and Azadnagar localities and enquired with concerned police station officials about the sequence of developments that led to clashes between protesters and the police on May 20. Police opened fire in the air and resorted to tear gas to disperse the crowd. 
 
 Even as the team discussed the issue with people at various places in Mango, Azadnagar and Purulia road, the role of local politicians belonging to a particular community remained the prime focus of inquiry. “Our investigation is going on the right track but it would be inappropriate to conclude the findings at such an early stage of investigation,” the commissioner said, wrapping up the day’s visit to the crime scenes related to the violence.
 
 The commissioner also said that violence which erupted following the lynching of four people of a particular community alone is perhaps not the sole reason behind the Steel city protest. “There are other reasons also behind the violence,” Pradeep said. He added, “Some clues have come to the light in the course of investigation and the line of action is in that direction.” He, however, refrained from disclosing the clues. 
 
 “We will examine the details collected from the police officials and the people and then come to a conclusion,” Kumar said. 
 
 The commissioner also said that the roles of the politicians accused in the violence in MGM, Azadnagar, Olidih, Mango and Dhatkidih are under investigation. He assured to complete the investigation in the next 10 to 12 days and subsequently submit a report to the state government in the first week of June.
 
 Prabhat reiterated that people who are guilty of the crime will not be spared and the innocent will not be harassed.
