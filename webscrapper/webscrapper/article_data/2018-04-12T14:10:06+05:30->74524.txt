LUDHIANA: In order to reduce the problem of water contamination and leakage in   lines, civic officials in the city have started a survey, through which they will prepare maps of existing water supply lines. The aim is to replace the old and decayed water supply lines, especially those which are deep inside the road as it becomes difficult to trace water leakage points in case of any damage to these lines. 

 The project has been taken up under second phase of   for Rejuvenation and Urban Transmission (AMRUT), a detailed report of which will be prepared on the basis of this survey. At present, the MC does not have a complete database regarding water supply lines. Most of the times, officials fail to locate the exact source of water contamination or leakage in the main lines.
 
 The deep water supply lines also create problems for the officials in case of any defect because it can lead to some mishap as well. Now, there is a proposal of geographic information system (GIS) mapping of the water supply lines for more authentic record of the underground water supply system.
 
 The superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell of MC   said the survey has kicked off in the city and in the next few days, the officials will prepare the maps of these water supply lines . A company hired for the AMRUT works will prepare the project report. He said it will take almost one year to commission the work on ground, but will bring respite from the old water supply lines and number of complaints regarding leakage in water lines will also reduce. 
 
 Notably, the leakage in the water supply lines is the main cause of water-borne diseases. People use contaminated water supply and fall ill. In the first phase, the officials have already laid down new water supply lines in 24 wards of the city. The rest of the city areas will be covered in the second phase.
