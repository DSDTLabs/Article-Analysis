MUMBAI: Currency in circulation which had been consistently declining since demonetisation rose for the first time in the week ended January 13, according to data released by Reserve Bank of India. Numbers published by RBI on Wednesday show that currency in circulation, which reflect the total value of legal tender in the form of currency notes, stood at Rs 9.5 lakh crore as on January 13, up Rs 52,790 crore during the week.

 Total currency in circulation as on November 8 stood at Rs 17.97 lakh crore and Rs 15.44 lakh crore of high denomination notes were demonetised. This means that the addition of new currency to replace the scrapped notes was Rs 6.97 lakh crore up to January 13.Interestingly , reports state that governor   has informed the   that RBI has infused Rs 9.2 lakh crore of new currency notes into the system after demonetisation.
 
 According to a report by   adjusting for holidays, the average daily value of new notes printed has fallen from Rs 14,000 crore during the first six weeks (10 Nov-19 Dec) to Rs3,700 crore between 19 Dec and 13 Jan.“This is probably because the RBI's focus has shifted to printing the lower-denomination notes (Rs 500 note and lower) from higher denomination notes (Rs 2000 note) earlier. Hence, the process of remonetisation is progressing, but incrementally at a slower pace,“ the report said. According to Nomura, the economy no longer requires a cash-to-GDP ratio of 12% since part of the cash was hoarded and because of a larger digital footprint.
