 Pacheco submitted that on December 7, 2015, judicial magistrate first class had discharged him in the case involving the May 29, 2009, incident that occurred in Casino Treasures at Majorda.
 
 The prosecution in its reply said there were two different cases. Prosecution said that Pacheco committed trespass by entering the casino without purchasing a ticket and that he had threatened casino personnel with dire consequences and extorted money from them.
