 But for the first game, Jindapol, ranked eight rungs behind world No.3 Sindhu, hardly looked inferior to the Indian. The 26-year-old Thai was swift on the court and troubled the Indian throughout the contest. After winning the first game in 19 minutes, Sindhu struggled to adjust to the drift after the change of courts. As a result she lost the second game.
 
 
 
 
 
 In the decider, Sindhu started with a 4-1 lead and then made it 8-4 before Jindapol gained control with some cleverly executed drives.
 
 At 9-9, Jindapol made two unforced errors allowing Sindhu to go into the break with a 11-9 lead. Thereafter, it was a see-saw battle between the two. Hitting the lines consistently and diving full length to return the shuttle, Jindapol threw herself all over the court and surged ahead to 16-12.
