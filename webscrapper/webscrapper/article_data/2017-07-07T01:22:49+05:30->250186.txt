MUMBAI: The proposal to fix the hiked entry charges for Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan, also known as  , was cleared without any debate in the   general body meeting on Thursday. 

 The hiked entry fee will be applicable as soon as the BMC print the new tickets, said a senior civic official. According to the proposal, zoo authorities will now charge an entry fee of Rs 100 for a family of four (mother, father and two children) and if they have a third child, the parents will have to pay an additional Rs 25; couples will be charged Rs 100; adults will be charged Rs 50 and children Rs 25. Presently, visitors are charged Rs 5 each, including entry to the penguin enclosure.
 
  In May, the   had opposed the fee hike proposal in the civic standing committee meeting stating that when the zoo is yet to get the proposed new facilities, the entry charges should not be raised. They also said that since the number of visitors has jumped after the inauguration of the Humboldt penguin enclosure, charges should, in fact, be reduced. But their requests were ignored.
 
 On Thursday, BJP members didn’t oppose the proposal when it come for the discussion. “We wanted to speak on the issue, but the mayor didn’t let us and cleared the proposal hastily,” claimed Manoj Kotak BJP group leader. 
 
 Congress favoured the fee hike proposal. Party leader Ravi Raja accused the BJP of adopting double standards. “The BJP had opposed the proposal when it came before the standing committee, but didn’t speak a word when it came before the general body for final clearance,” he said.
