Madurai: Preparations are under way for Madurai Chittirai festival, with the city corporation kick-starting the works on a ramp on the Vaigai riverbed where the concluding event is scheduled to be held.

 The ramp is being constructed using sandbags and concrete and the work will be completed at a cost of Rs 5 lakh, said corporation sources. The ramp is expected arrest the sewage flowing into the river near the point where the deity enters the river. Every year the corporation constructs a ramp and temporarily closes the opening of the Panthalgudi channel which brings the sewage for the festival.
 
 The civic body uses smaller pipes to carry the sewage away from the deityâ€™s entry point. This year the Chittirai festival begins on April 18, with the flag hoisting at the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple and the celestial wedding will be held on April 27. The second part of the festival will begin at the Alagarkoil temple on April 26 when the deity leaves for Madurai and enters the river in Madurai city on April 30.
 
 PWD usually releases water from the Vaigai dam for the festival to ensure that deity enters a flowing river. However, it has not been able to do so for the last two years due to drought. The last time the river received water for the festival was in 2015. Sources from the PWD said that it would be difficult for them to release water if there is no rain in the catchments areas of the major dam before the festival begins.
 
 Though festivals are celebrated in Madurai throughout the year, Chittirai festival, which is linked to the deities of Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple and Alagarkoil temple, is the most popular. Deity from the Alagarkoil temple comes to Madurai and enters the river Vaigai, near the A V Bridge in Madurai city, on the northern bank.
