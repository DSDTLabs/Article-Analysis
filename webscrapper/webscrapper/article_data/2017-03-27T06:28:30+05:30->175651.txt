BENGALURU: With its new-found friendship with the Congress, the JD(S) is toying with the idea of bagging the legislative council chairman's post by moving a no-confidence resolution against current chairman D H   Sources said JD(S) MLC T A Sarvana met chief minister   on Sunday seeking his support to remove  's Shankarmurthy and replace him with its seventh-time MLC  .

 “Discussions are on with the Congress and JD(S). But we are yet to decide when we need to move the motion,“ said senior Congress MLC V S Ugrappa. Currently , the deputy chairperson's post is with   of JD(S).
 
 To move a resolution for removing the council chairman, Congress and JD(S) need the support of 38 members. The Congress has 32 members, including independents, and JD(S) has 12 compared to BJP's 31 members.
 
 As per rules, to move a no-confidence motion, a notice must be issued before 14 days. On that basis, both Congress and JD(S) may not move it during this budget session but only during the monsoon assembly session.
 
 Incidentally, Shankarmurthy's name is doing the rounds for the governor's post and he is hoping to get a call at the earliest.
