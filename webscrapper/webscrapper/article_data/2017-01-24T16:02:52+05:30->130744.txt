AHMEDABAD: When Hanif Gohel made a false complaint before consumer court that he could not withdraw money from ATM and yet the amount was deducted from his bank account, he might have forgotten that his transactions took place under  .

 The bank authorities could easily falsify his claims by placing   in courtroom and flattened his claims to compensation of Rs 1 lakh for "deficiency in service".
 
 This incident occurred in Prabhas Patan town on Gir-Somnath district. Gohel, a watch repairer, approached the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum at Junagadh and sued the State Bank of India. His complaint was that when he tried to withdraw an amount of Rs 10,000 from bank's ATM, he got only receipt and the money never came out of the tellering machine, but the amount got deducted from his bank account. This happened four times in August 2013.
 
 Gohel told the court that he brought the issue to the notice of bank authorities, who assured him to redress the problem but did nothing in this regard. He urged the court to ask the bank to return the amount of Rs 40,000 that was erroneously deducted from his account besides Rs 1 lakh towards compensation for mental harassment and Rs 10,000 for litigation cost.
 
 The bank authorities termed the complaint a false one and placed before the court the   footage, in which Gohel was seen making the transactions in successful manner. The footage showed him withdrawing money and counting currency notes in the ATM.
 
 After watching the CCTV footage, the consumer court rejected Gohel's complaint.
