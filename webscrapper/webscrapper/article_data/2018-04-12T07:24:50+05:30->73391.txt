PUNE: Pune rail division authorities have indefinitely postponed re-introduction of battery-operated cars at  .

 The cars were expected to ferry passengers from March.
 
 The authorities said that construction of a new foot over bridge connecting all platforms at the station was currently underway and introduction of battery-operated cars would be risky at this stage.
 
  
 “We had planned to introduce these vehicles for passengers but there are some issues. Pune station has been getting a large number of passengers and we expect the load to remain the same till mid-June. So we feel it will be difficult as well as risky for these vehicles to move on platforms. We have studied the scenario and don’t think it is a good idea right now,” a railway official told TOI.
 
 Officials had earlier said that two cars would be introduced on platform number 1 under the corporate social responsibility scheme. A few years ago, the station had one such vehicle but it was discontinued due to some issues with drivers.
 
 “The foot over bridge will be the widest among other existing over bridges at the station. While the project will be completed by June, some parts of platform number 1 will have to be demolished. So, plying of battery-operated cars is not a good move,” the official added.
 
 Due to the holiday season, Pune station has been witnessing a footfall of more than 1 lakh every day. Rail authorities have already increased platform ticket rates from Rs 10 to Rs 20 till June 15.
 
 “I recently came to know that battery-operated cars have been introduced at the   (CSMT) in Mumbai. Being a senior citizen, I was hoping that the same would be introduced at Pune station and was happy when it was announced that the cars will begin operation by March. Now I am disappointed and feel that there is some other reason behind it,” S.K Joshi, whose son works in Delhi, said.
 
 Harsha Shah, president of   group, said that the decision to postpone the plan was unfortunate. “How can they just postpone introduction of battery-operated cars? Does CSMT get less number of passengers compared to Pune station? Officials should state clearly that they have not been able to find interested parties because they have not shown much interest in the whole project,” Shah said.
