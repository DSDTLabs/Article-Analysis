 plays the character of a Bihari lad in Mohit Suri’s ‘Half Girlfriend’, and the first video of his introduction is finally out. As per the reports, the actor spent about 10 days in Bihar and interacted with the people there in order too understand their habits and latch on to their accents. This would’ve surely given more authenticity to his role as   in the movie.

  In the introduction video, it looks like he is reading excerpts from Chetan Bhagat’s book. ‘Half Girlfriend’ is in fact an adaptation of one of Chetan Bhagat’s bestselling novels with the same name.
 
 Not only did Arjun spend time with the Biharis in their city, but also hired a language coach in order to get accurate diction and pronunciation of certain words.
