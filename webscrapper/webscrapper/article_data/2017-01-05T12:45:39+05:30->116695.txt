CHARMINAR: What was once a key landmark, the five-storied clock tower in   is now wallowing in neglect due to the negligence by the department of archaeology and museums (DAM). 

 The Mahboob Chowk clock tower was built in 1892 by  , then prime minister of Hyderabad. The clock is also considered to be an important part of Hyderabad's architectural heritage. The tower was erected in the midst of a small garden, which had four large clocks on each side, allowing people to check time from any direction. 
 
 Once it would attract everyone's attention, but unfortunately, negligence on part of the archaeological department has resulted in black spots spreading all over the tower and no initiative taken to repair the broken clock.
 
  "Now neither a tower nor their clocks are maintained properly. It must be thrown open for public and tourists. We want to see its original glory once again, so we want authorities to bring back the glory of the clock tower for our generation," said Md Fareed Pasha, a resident of Mahboob Chowk.
 
 Besides, the garden has now turned into a haven for miscreants who play cards and drink liquor by wanderers. 
 
 "For the last 15 years, the garden is used to play cards and drink liquor all day long. The restoration of the clock-tower for general public may ward away antisocial elements from entering into its premises,'' Hassan Khan, a resident of Chandrayangutta complained.
 
 Another resident of the same locality says its very difficult for someone to get a shop on rent in this congested place. "While we are thankful to previous rulers of Hyderabad, who have built such an ideal and beautiful structure for Hyderabadis. 
 
 But what angers us is the negligence towards it maintenance,''  , resident of Owaisi Nagar.
