CHENNAI: In a boost to Indian women seeking employment as domestic workers in  , the Centre has announced that those recruiting through the six state government agencies would, with immediate effect, have the   of 1,100 Omani Riyal waived. Overseas Manpower Corporation Limited based at Guindy in Chennai is the authorized agency for recruitment in Tamil Nadu.

 The other  , diplomatic sources at the   in   said, are NORKA Roots, Kerala, Overseas Development Employment Promotion Consultants (ODEPEC) Kerala, Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation, Overseas Manpower Company, Andhra Pradesh Ltd (OMCAP) and Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. Recruitment of such women workers from any other recruitment agency in India will continue to require a bank guarantee of 1100 Omani Riyal and an NOC from the Embassy. Omani recruitment agencies have also been told to recruit women domestic workers through the E-Migrate system.
 
 Last week, the Centre scrapped the $2,500 bank guarantee it had made mandatory for employers in Kuwait to pay for recruitment of Indian domestic workers.
 
 To protect its workers from exploitation, including non-payment of wages, India introduced the rule in 2014 and said its embassies in those countries would receive the guarantee before endorsing the recruitment of the owrker concerned. Kuwait was the only Gulf country to refuse to comply with the condition.
 
 Now, with the Centre easing the norms on recruitment of housemaids, diplomatic sources in the Gulf say more more women from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana could be heading out.
