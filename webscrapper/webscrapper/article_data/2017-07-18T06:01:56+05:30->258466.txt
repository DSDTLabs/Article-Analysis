AHMEDABAD: The body of an 11-year-old boy was found in a pit at GMDC ground, opposite   stand on Monday morning. The victim, a resident of Ghatlodia, had been missing since June 15. Police said that, prima facie, this seems to be a case of drowning after falling into the pit.

 Vastrapur police said residents from near the ground reported a body floating in the five-foot pit at 11am. The body became visible after the water level had receded. The victim’s parents arrived at the spot and identified him as   (11), a resident of the shanties near   in Ghatlodia.
 
 “Kishan was a class VII student at Suraj Hindi School and the only child of his parents. Both his parents work as domestic helps in Vastrapur and Bodakdev areas. On June 15, he had left to visit his friends and relatives. We suspect he may have decided to take a short-cut across the ground and accidentally fell into the pit,” said an investigator.
 
 H P Karen, inspector of Vastrapur police station, said they are investigating all possible angles. 
 
 “The CCTV camera at the BRTS stop opposite the ground is not working.   have taken his viscera and samples to perform a diatom test. We are waiting for the postmortem report,” he said.
 
 Experts said that the diatom test is performed in cases of death by drowning in open water bodies. If the micro-organisms found in the water are also found in the victim’s body, it corroborates that death had taken place at the spot and the victim was not dumped there after his death.
