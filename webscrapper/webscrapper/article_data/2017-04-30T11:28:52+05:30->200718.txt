THRISSUR: Flags were hoisted at ten temples participating at the   on Saturday marking the beginning of the   associated with the famous festival to be held on May 5-6. 

 A large number of people had assembled to witness the 'kodiyettam' at the temples. The flags were hoisted around noon at the Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu temples, the two major participants in the festival.
 
 The office-bearers of the Paramekkavu temple had chosen to scale down the festivities in protest against the decision of the authorities to permit only limited scale fireworks display as per the directive of the   (PESO).
 
 They arranged only one elephant for the procession instead of the usual five and the percussion concert was also scaled down. 
 
 While   led the percussion concert inside Paramekkavu, Cheroor Rajappan, a traditional melam artiste of the temple, headed the procession when it came out of the temple. They avoided the fireworks after the Kodiyettam ceremony as well.
 
  office-bearers did not join the protest. "Kodiyettam is more of a ritual and we used to hold processions only with one elephant every year as part of the ceremony. We used only locally available varieties of fireworks like Kathina for the event,'' said an office-bearer of Thiruvambady temple.
 
 Tuskers Sivasundar and Kasinathan carried the idols at the Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu temple processions, respectively.
