PUNE: Most Indian festivals are characterized by playing of musical instruments. So is the case with Durga Puja — incomplete without the beats of dhaks.

 Back in Bengal, people are used to waking up to the sound of dhaks on Puja days. Keeping the tradition alive, many puja organizers in the city have roped in dhakis (drummers) all the way from West Bengal.
 
 Like other dhakis, Narugopal Das (46) eagerly waits for Durga Puja every year. The festival ensures he earns enough to survive. For the past three years, Narugopal from Ambika Kalna in West Bengal has been coming to Pune to play dhak for the Bangiyo Samaskruti Samsad (BSS). His sons, Tarak (25) and Saujan (22), now play dhak with him.
 
 “Before Narugopal, his maternal uncle used to play for us,” said Arun Chattopadhyay, the general secretary of BSS.
 
 The dhakis coming all the way from Bengal earn at least double the amount here than what they get in the home state. 
 
 Mansa Das from Midnapore district of West Bengal has been playing dhak for the Bengalee Association for the past four years. He feels though the pandals in Pune lack the Kolkata grandeur, they were less chaotic. “People who do not even understand the Bengali culture too appreciate our art. This makes us feel better and makes coming all the way here worthwhile,” Mansa said.
