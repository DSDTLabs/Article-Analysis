Nagpur: Work on the   corridor, also known as Nagpur-Mumbai super expressway, was slated to start in July 2017 and one phase was to be over by October 2019. However, land acquisition problems have delayed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s pet project. So far only 68% land has been acquired for the Rs46,000 crore mega project. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) is executing the project, which needs 8,600 hectare land.

 Banks, which have agreed in-principle to lend for the expressway, have made it clear that loans will not be disbursed until at least 80% land acquisition was completed.
 
 Some weeks ago, the state government had formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — Nagpur Mumbai Super Communication Express Way Limited — for speeding up land acquisition and also to generate better financing and operational control for project contractors. It remains to be seen whether this SPV can deliver the job.
 
 A source in the MSRDC said that land acquisition work in some districts was going on smoothly while the government was facing problems in other districts. “For example, 92% land has been acquired in Nagpur district while the figure for Aurangabad, where most of the land is required, is only 59%. There are various issues affecting land acquisition, major one being opposition from farmers,” he said.
 
 MSRDC’s land requirement varies in different districts. It needs over 1,000 hectares in Washim, Buldhana, Aurangabad and Nashik districts. The percentage of land acquired is low in these districts: Washim 72.5%, Buldhana 71%, Aurangabad 59% and Nashik 62%. In totality, so far only 5,860 out of the 8,600 hectares have been acquired.
 
 There are four villages where joint management survey (JMS) is still incomplete. They include Chikhli Vaidya (Amravati district) and Shiwde, Ghorwad and Borkhinda (Nashik district).
 
 Meanwhile, the five government agencies are slowly disbursing their share for the project to the MSRDC. “Out of the Rs 5,500 crore required from them, we have received Rs3,500 crore so far. We have chipped in with Rs 650 crore equity,” the source said. The agencies are Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO).
