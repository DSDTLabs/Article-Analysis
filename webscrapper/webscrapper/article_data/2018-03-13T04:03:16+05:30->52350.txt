MUMBAI: In a surprise political move, BJP on Monday fielded its fourth candidate for the crucial   elections, as a result, the chances of unopposed elections are now bleak. 

 So far, BJP has nominated Union minister Prakash Jawdekar, former chief minister Narayan Rane, Kerala BJP leader K Muralidharan as its candidates, while   has nominated veteran journalist Kumar Ketkar, Shiv Sena has fielded Anil Desai and NCP has re-nominated Vandana Chavan. So far, it was assumed that the elections would be unopposed, however, unexpectedly BJP nominated state women commission chairperson   as its fourth nominee.
 
 A senior BJP leader said in view of surplus votes of BJP and Shiv Sena, as well as support from Independent legislators, it should not be difficult for BJP to secure the fourth seat. It appears that both Congress and NCP do not have sufficient votes. Against the quota of 42 votes required for securing a victory, no doubt Congress has 42 and NCP has 41 votes, but they may not be able to secure all the votes. Congress fears that at least two of its legislators will not vote in favour of the party nominee. Also with Patangrao Kadam's demise, the effective strength of Congress will be 39. And, as NCP is concerned,   and Ramesh Kadam are in jail, as a result, it has only 39 votes. Both Bhujbal and Kadam will have to secure permission from court to exercise their right to vote. The BJP leader said the party is banking on its own three surplus votes and 13 of Shiv Sena as well as Independents supporting the government. In addition, the party expects a section of Congress and NCP legislators to come to the rescue of BJP's fourth nominee.
