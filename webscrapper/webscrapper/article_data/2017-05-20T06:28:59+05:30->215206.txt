THRISSUR:   at   in the state will resume on Saturday. This is after the   (UIDAI) accepted the demand by   centre operators that the authority stops insisting capturing their iris image on every Aadhaar enrolment form processed by them. 

 The services were stopped on Tuesday protesting against the clause added through a directive issued on May 1. 
 
 According to the CITU-affiliated Akshaya state committee, which gave the strike call, the clause was harming the health of Akshaya staff. Till recently the operators were needed to affix only their finger print impressions, but this was changed to iris scans to track the identity of employees who provide the service. But frequent exposure to high-intensity infrared rays resulted in health problems like sleep loss and irritation of eyes.
