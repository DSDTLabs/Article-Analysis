TRICHY: The postmortem report of R Usha, 30, revealed that she was not pregnant at the time of her death, here on Monday. She succumbed to head injuries, after a traffic inspector kicked the two-wheeler on which she was travelling with her husband on March 7.

 “The claim of her being pregnant is not true according to the report. However, there was a cyst in her uterus,”   superintendent of police   told   on Monday evening.
 
 Usha’s death led a widespread protest against the police officer for causing her death after her husband   failed to wear helmet and stop at the vehicle check at   toll gate in Trichy. The inspector chased the couple by another bike and kicked their bike. The twist in the claim about her pregnancy will not make any changes in the charges under which   was booked. He was arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and lodged in Trichy central prison.
