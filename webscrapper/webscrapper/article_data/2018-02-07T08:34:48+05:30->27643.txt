LUCKNOW: A month since his father died after falling down the garbage duct at Dr   (RMLIMS), Ram Kishun has been awaiting justice.

 The family, which hails from Campierganj,  , will visit Lucknow on Wednesday and try to meet chief minister Yogi Adityanath, asking for action in the case. The family had submitted a written complaint at   police station to lodge an FIR of negligence against the medical institute for causing the death of Ram Pyaare (62) on January 13.
 
 They had also sent a letter to the CM accusing the institute of negligence and demanding a probe.
 
 “The police have not lodged an FIR yet. They claim that no postmortem was done on my father’s body so an FIR cannot be registered. The SSP also said that a medical board will be set up to look into our grievance against the institute. That has also not been done,” said Kishun. The family runs a small tea stall in Campierganj.
 
 Kishun also claimed he had tried to meet the CM at   temple in Gorakhpur but was not allowed in. “We had also sent an application to BJP MLA from Campierganj Fateh Bahadur Singh but nothing has been done. We are awaiting justice,” he said.
