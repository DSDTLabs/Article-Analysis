CHENNAI: Birdwatchers in the city are excited by the sighting of a lone lesser flamingo in the   marshland two days ago.

 Sharing details with TOI, Nature Trust founder   said one of their members,  , spotted the migrant.
 
 The white bird with reddish beak was first recorded in the Pallikaranai marshland two years ago. Lesser flamingos come to India from as far as Iran during the winter.
 
 The Perumbakkam marshland has become one of the major destinations for migrant birds. In the last three years, at least a dozen rare birds, especially waders, have come to the marshland in large numbers, he says. The presence of waders has attracted raptors too. Nearly half a dozen species of raptors were reported in Perumbakkam during winter in the last two years, said Thirunaranan.
 
 Birdwatchers recorded great white pelicans, avocets, white winged terns, Pacific golden plovers, curlew sandpipers, Caspian terns, Eurasian curlews, spotted redshanks, Eurasian wigeons, ruddy-breasted crakes and  's crakes are some of the rare waders in Perumbakkam.
 
 Raptors migrating here in the winter include peregrine falcons, red-necked falcons, Indian spotted eagles, greater spotted eagles, ospreys and western marsh harriers, he said.
 
 Explaining the difference between the two species of flamingo found in India, Thirunaranan said the beak of the greater flamingo is rose in colour.
 
 Moreover, greater flamingos migrate here from north India during winter, he said.
