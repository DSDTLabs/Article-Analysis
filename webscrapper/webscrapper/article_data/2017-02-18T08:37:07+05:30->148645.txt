CHENNAI: An ailing DMK patriarch   is not likely to attend the   scheduled for Saturday ,   T K S Elangovan told TOI. In a close finish, one vote could decide the fate of the  . But, with his absence, Karunanidhi may well make history .

 At a meeting of DMK legislators in the city on Friday evening, the party decided to vote against the Palaniswami government. There was no discussion, however, over Karunanidhi taking part in the special assembly session. “Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) will not be coming to the state assembly tomorrow,“ Elangovan, a Rajya Sabha member told TOI.
 
 The 93-year-old leader has been ailing since December last year and has remained out of active politics.
 
 But, Karunanidhi will be sorely missed during the crucial test vote.With a significant DMK presence in the 234-strong assembly and in a close contest, Karunanidhi's vote could tilt the balance, point out observers. DMK has 89 members, including Karunanidhi, while its ally Congress has eight and IUML one, taking the total opposition strength to 98. With the OPS faction claiming support of 11 members, it could be a close call for Palaniswami.
 
 It will be crucial for DMK in the event of a tie. While the assembly speaker will be called to cast his vote, for DMK, Karunanidhi's vote would have been a clincher to bring down the Sasikala-backed Palaniswami government. Sources said the DMK leader was not in a position to attend the assembly . It is not clear if assembly rule would allow Karunanidhi to use a proxy .
