MTV Roadies Xtreme's latest episode took the judges' panel through a riot of emotions as the contestants, who came to try to their luck in the auditions, unraveled their tale on the show.

 Shruti Sinha was the first one who wowed the gang leaders with her smooth dance moves and a startling tale which involved her escaping the clutches of a miscreant who was allegedly running a sex racket. She was selected to proceed in the game.
 
 This was followed by a few fun-filled moments in which Rannvijay asked Nikhil to do the bhangra as a task. It cracked up everyone when the latter broke into a dance.
 
 Hemant was the next contestant who tried to woo the gang leaders with his rap song. Unfortunately, he rubbed them the wrong way by talking about some objectionable things in his form and his song was also one in which he had objectified women. Things got worse when   called up the contestant's girlfriend to tell her about his secret affairs. He had a hard time dealing with the reactions of the gang leaders that followed.
 
 Mini and Alisha were the next two contestants who were called in together for the auditions. There were asked to compete in a task and then they were asked to roast each other. What followed was a barrage distasteful comments that passed between the two of them. Alisha lost all the three tasks and that worked in Mini's favour. Neha drove Alisha out when she read some questionable things that she had mentioned about Rannvijay in her form.
  
  
 Next, Vidit Sharma came in to try his luck. He overwhelmed everyone with his tale of personal loss in which he lost his sister in a car accident. After listening to his story, Neha and Raftaar broke into tears and Rannvijay had to step in to console them. He was selected by the four gang leaders to proceed in the game.
 
 Prince was given a task by Rannvijay to seductively dance around Raftaar. The episode on a lighter note.
