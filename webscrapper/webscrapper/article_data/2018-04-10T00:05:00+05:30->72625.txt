“An aesthetically clicked picture can give even a beautiful painting a run for its money,” says Bengaluru-based photographer and documentary filmmaker  , according to whom   is gradually getting out of the grips of its niche genre and making inroads into people’s homes. An upsurge in demand for photo collections — that include panoramic, architectural and monochrome frames — in the West has slowly begun to reflect in the Indian market too, with Bengalureans having a special eye for people portraits and pictures of culture and   that have an imaginative appeal to them.

  “Although anyone carrying a smartphone is a photographer in today’s world, fine art photography goes a step ahead in capturing the intricacies and expressions of the subject — be it a person walking on the street on a rainy night or a bird flying in the sky. This requires not just a single-lens reflex camera to capture the moment, but also a keen eye to find beauty in an otherwise mundane subject, and present it aesthetically in the form of a photograph,” explains Sriharsha, who is currently curating fine art pictures from photographers across India, Kenya and the UK, and showcasing them in an online platform called, ArtBuRt.
 
  There is a lot of curiosity among people for photographs of quintessential subjects that look surreal and make interesting décor items for their homes. “For instance, one art lover asked for an 
 
  aesthetically captured picture of an auto rickshaw that he wanted to put up on the wall of his living room. The price is another factor for the rise in demand. Sometimes, a print of a creative photograph comes in more affordable than a piece of painting by a well-known artist.”
 
  The venture — which Sriharsha runs along with his wife Sireesha — aims at bringing both professional and amateur photographers to the fore, and create a marketplace for pictures that tell stories through the lens.
