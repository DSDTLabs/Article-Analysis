CHENNAI:   has been the lone bright spot in   (CCFC)’s I-League campaign this season. He had impressed with his skills and swift movement, making him a target of   clubs.

 
 As reported by TOI on February 19, several ISL clubs had even approached CCFC to rope in Soosairaj. On Wednesday, a source close to the club confirmed that CCFC have finally reached an agreement with  . The 23-year-old will don Jamshedpur colours from next season and a formal announcement will be made in a couple of days.
 
 It was learnt that clubs like Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC and Northeast United FC were keen on signing Soosairaj. But Jamshedpur came up with the best deal. “It comes as no surprise that Soosai was on the radar of many ISL clubs after his performance this season. But we were waiting for good offers. We had first asked Chennaiyin FC but their offer did not suit us. So he will be a Jamshedpur player from next season. But he will lead us once again in the Super Cup,” a source close to the club told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 The midfielder’s transfer fee will be Rs 25 lakhs approximately which is a couple of lakhs more than what CCFC got after selling their other homegrown player Nandhakumar to Delhi Dynamos. The midfielder will also have a buyout clause of around Rs 95 lakhs and Chennai City are also trying to include a buyback option in case Jamshedpur decides to sell him later. In case CCFC do not buy him back and Jamshedpur decide to sell the player to any other club, they will have to pay CCFC a 15% of the then transfer fee.
 
 Soosairaj, though, doesn’t want to go overboard. Instead, his focus now is on Super Cup. “When ISL clubs show interest in you, it feels great. But I don’t want to think about leaving. I will lead CCFC in Super Cup and intend to give my best. This club has given me recognition and lots of happy memories. I hope I can return here and represent this club once again,” Soosairaj told TOI.
