AGRA: Compared to the last three elections, the number of candidates in assembly elections 2017 has significantly decreased. The BSP is the only political party which is contesting on all 403 constituencies in UP.   and the SP are at second and third place respectively. In the entire state, a total of 4,854 candidates are in the fray this time. The number was 6,839 in the 2012 assembly elections.
 
  Experts suggest the falling number is a positive move towards a healthy democracy. Deepshikha Chaturvedi, head of the department of political science of DAV College, Kanpur, said, “Decrease in number of candidates for the assembly elections this time is a favourable development for democracy. It is mainly due to lower number of dummy candidates fielded by small political parties and independents motivated by major political parties. Lower number of candidates has resulted in less confusion among voters and misuse of money.”
  
  The editorial board member of Uttar Pradesh Political Science Association (UPPSA) counts the recent demonetisation and strict enforcement of rules and regulations by Election Commission as two immediate reasons for decrease in number of candidates.
  
  The nomination process for the multi-phase election began on January 17 and ended on February 20. In the last three elections, the total number of candidates was more than 5,000, compared to the 4,854 this time. More than two decades ago, in the assembly elections of 1996, the number of candidates 4,429, of which 46%, that is 2,031, were independents. The numbers had been rising ever since. In the 2012 election, the total number of candidates was 6839, while in the 2007 elections it was 6,086. In 2002, the number of candidates had seen a massive jump compared to the 1996 figure, and stood at 5,533.
  
  This time the lowest number of candidates are in Haiderganj constituency of Barabanki district. Here only three candidates are in the fray. The highest number, 26, are in Allahabad North and Agra South seats.
  
  In 2012, of the 6,839 candidates, around 25%, or 1,691 were independent, of which only six won. A total of 222 political parties participated in the elections, but candidates of only 10 were elected. Nearly 84%, or 5,760 of the candidates had not been able to retain their deposits.
  
  Of all the assembly elections which have taken place in Uttar Pradesh, the highest number of candidates contested in 1993. That year, there were 9,716 candidates contesting for 422 constituencies. Of these, 6,557 were independent candidates. Agra Cantonment saw the highest number of candidates, at 77. A record 8,652 candidates forfeited their deposits.
