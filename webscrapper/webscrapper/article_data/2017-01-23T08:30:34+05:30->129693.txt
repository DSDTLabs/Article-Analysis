SECUNDERABAD: Come February, widening of a key culvert in   ( ) in Secunderabad Cantonment will be completed, much to the relief of residents and motorists.

 On Sunday, the works pertaining to cement concrete slab, the main portion of the culvert, began. 
 
 Once the culvert is opened to the public, nearly one lakh commuters would be benefited to reach   and other parts of Secunderabad without any traffic hurdle. Originally, the culvert was constructed during the Nizam era with 25-feet width, but with volume of traffic increasing double-fold, it didn’t help. 
 
 Keeping in view of this, the   (SCB) has decided to widen up the culvert to 50-feet and spend nearly Rs one crore. 
 
 Commuters coming from Medchal and Bowenpally checkpost towards Paradise Circle cross the newly constructed culvert. Earlier, traffic jams occurred on this narrow culvert during peak hours and once its throw open for public, a free flow of traffic movement can be expected, SCB officials said.
 
 “As per the schedule, the contractor had to complete the culvert by September 2016, but due to various reasons, SCB authorities extended it for another few months and put the deadline up to February,” a source in SCB said. Almost works pertaining to this are complete and its likely to be opened in February mid week, he said. 
 
 “Thousands of locals residing nearby the colonies of this culvert used to reach their homes through altenerate route as the culvert is narrow,” said K Nageswara Rao, resident of Bapuji Nagar. 
 
 A multi-national software company employee,   who is staying in Medchal said everyday its a horrible experience to reach Paradise circle by crossing this culvert. “Because of heavy traffic jam, the move to widen the culvert is a great one,” he added.
 
 Once the culvert is opened to the public, nearly one lakh commuters would be benefited to reach Paradise circle and other parts of Secunderabad without any traffic hurdle
