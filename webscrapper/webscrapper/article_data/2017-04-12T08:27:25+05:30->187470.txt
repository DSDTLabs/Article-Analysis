HYDERABAD: Noting that suicides by farmers was an irrefutable fact, the   on Tuesday issued notices to the Centre,  , AP,  , NABARD and others, giving them four weeks to respond to a plea seeking waiver of farm loans to prevent further deaths.

 “Chilli farmers are in dire straits as there is no support price. The per quintal price is down to `4,000 from `12,000. A farmer is unable to realise even half his cost. A clerk is fixing the price in Guntur market yard, while the state has turned a blind eye,“ petitioner K Siva Ram Reddy ,a farmer from Tullur mandal in Guntur who argued the case as a party in person, told a bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther.
 
 “Adding insult to injury , AP's agriculture minister described farmers as impotent and drug addicts,“ he said, adding that while banks use coercive methods against small farmers owing small amounts, they show little interest in recovering nearly `6 lakh crore of business and industrial loans. All farmers dying in distress were tenant farmers, he said as he sought implementation of Swaminathan Committee report on farm distress.
 
 When Telangana's counsel spoke about steps taken to pay ex-gratia to kin of dead farmers, the petitioner shot back: “First muster up courage to stop farmers from resorting to the extreme step.“ He warned that the two states would see several more suicides if loans were not waived.
