Rajkot: Two nurses at the health centre run by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) were suspended on Saturday for allegedly administering wrong vaccine to a three-month-old child. 

 The child was given measles vaccine instead of pentavalent vaccine, the RMC officials said.
 
 According to RMC officials, a vaccination drive was organized at Narayannagar health centre on March 8. Chirag Kakad had brought his three-month-old child for vaccination with the Mamta vaccination card. The child was supposed to be given pentavalent vaccine, but instead he was administered measles vaccine. After the child’s father lodged a complaint, RMC officials conducted an investigation and suspend two nurses — Alpa Salot and Kokila Mal. 
 
 RMC in a statement said that its officials apologized to the parents for the mistake. A paediatrician Dr Hiren Mashru also examined the child and found that he was not suffering from any side effects. tnn
