MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Friday slammed the   for inaction against illegal   and hawkers on a busy   in   that also leads to the refineries, saying it would be responsible if an accident occurred.

 The court heard a PIL filed in 2012 by Chembur Citizens Forum for widening of the arterial Ramkrishna Chemburkar (RC) Road, which connects to Mahul and Ghatkopar. In July 2012 the BMC had told the court it had initiated action against unauthorised structures blocking the widening of the road and would inform it about the alternative location for the shifting of the shops.
 
 The court was informed that the situation had not changed over the past five years. “The figures have multiplied. The road requires immediate action,” the advocate for the forum said. He said many tankers take the road to the refineries and it would be tragic if there were an accident.
 
 “If any accident occurs, the corporation will be responsible,” the judges said.
 
 The BMC advocate said it was trying to identify and relocate structures eligible for rehabilitation. The judges said they were “not at impressed” with the submission.
