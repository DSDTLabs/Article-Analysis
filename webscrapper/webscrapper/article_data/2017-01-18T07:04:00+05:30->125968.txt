BATHINDA: The sister of former gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky, who was killed in April 2016, filed her nomination on Tuesday to contest from Fazilka assembly constituency as an independent candidate. Rajdeep Kaur (41) was earlier aspiring to be the   nominee from the constituency, which decided to field SAD MP Sher Singh Ghubaya’s son   Ghubaya.

 Rocky, who was killed by gangsters on April 30, 2016, at Parwanoo in  , had contested the 2012 assembly election from Fazilka as an independent. He had polled 39,209 votes and lost by just 1,692 votes to Surjit Kumar Jayani of BJP.
 
 Rocky faced about 20 cases of murder, extortion and kidnapping during his lifetime. He was preparing to contest the 2017 polls before being killed.
 
 Former BSP MP Dhanjay Kumar from Uttar Pradesh accompanied Rajdeep while she filed her nomination papers. “I was an aspirant for the Congress ticket, but as my thousands of supporters asked me to contest, I have filed nomination papers as an independent candidate,” she said.
