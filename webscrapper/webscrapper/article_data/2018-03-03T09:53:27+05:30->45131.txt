KOCHI: Environmentalist  , who was addressing a gathering at Puthuvype on Friday, was stunned by the outstanding bravery of an a eight-year-old girl. Soon after Patkar concluded her speech, the leaders of Puthuvype LPG Terminal   introduced Vianisa Sunil to the   and narrated to her how the child faced police atrocity when residents of Puthuvype protested against   plant at High Court Junction in June last year. 

 They told Patkar that the girl, who reached the venue along with her parents, was caned by police and was hospitalised for eight days. Hearing this, a stunned Patkar asked Vianisa, "Are you scared to go to jail for the cause of environment?" The girl nodded in the negative when one of the residents translated the question in Malayalam.
 
 Delighted with the girl's reply, Patkar said, "If you dare to face police at this age, you will not fear facing anybody in the future." The activist did not forget to congratulate the girl before leaving the venue.
 
 While addressing the gathering, Patkar said that it was very sad that people in a state where a Left government is ruling, have to carry on with their protest against setting up the plant. She urged the residents to carry on with their protest.
 
 She said corporates want to monopolise the coastal belts of India by setting up their private ports. "Corporates are becoming powerful and they are in tie up with governments. That's why corporates get all the concessions in the budget. All the natural resources, including minerals and agriculture, are going to be finished if the current development pattern is continued," she said.
 
 " , tribespeople and fishermen have a very close relationship with nature. But that relationship is being broken, threatened, damaged and demolished. You and me should take the responsibility to carry on with the battle till the end," she told the residents.
