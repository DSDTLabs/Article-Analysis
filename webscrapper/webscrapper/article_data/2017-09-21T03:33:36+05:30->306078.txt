NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has asked the AAP government to fast-track setting up vending  , saying that the rights of   is being “grossly affected.”

 A HC bench asked the government to set up Town Vending Committee (TVC) in each municipality and consider the representations of street vendors in Delhi.
 
 The court gave the direction after Congress leader Ajay Maken, along with some NGOs and traders’ associations, alleged that the law on setting up of TVC has been violated as these bodies do not comprise the elected representatives of the vendors.
 
 The court said that the matter “should be looked into expeditiously, as the number of cases is increasing and there are obstructions on roads and pavements as well. In the absence of formation of TVC, rights of street vendors are being grossly affected.”

 The petitioners had argued that an election should be held among over 1,32,000 vendors whose names were mentioned in the lists prepared by a various committees formed to deal with the allotment of places for the vendors.
 
 A batch of petitions has challenged the Act, which was enacted to regulate vendors in public areas and protect their rights. They have also challenged the rules and the schemes of the   in this regard.
 
 They prayed the court should monitor implementation of the provisions of the Act until certificates of vending were issued to the vendors and the grievance redressal and dispute resolution committees became functional.
