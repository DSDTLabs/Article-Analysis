CHENNAI: Three   at the coast in Devaneri village, 3km from  , over the past three days. 

 Turtle conservationists said swollen necks and bulging eyes of the dead turtles indicate that they may have drowned after getting entangled in fishing nets. A turtle is an air-breathing reptile which needs to come up to the ocean surface for air every 45 minutes. According to studies, only 5-6% of dead turtles are washed ashore.
 
 Supriya Dharini of Tree Foundation, which works for turtle preservation, said, “The turtles may have died of suffocation after getting entangled in a trawl net or a ray fish net. If these nets are not fitted with the turtle excluder device (TED), the turtles will not be able to escape.”
 
 In September 2015, the   department issued an amendment to the   Marine Fishing Regulation Rules, 1983. It added a clause stating that no trawl net shall be used without fixing TED during the breeding season — January to March — when turtles approach the shore to lay eggs. “However, there is no sign of these devices being used anywhere,” said Dharini.
 
 Over the last week, at least a dozen dead turtles were found dead along the shore within a 10km stretch on either side of the Mahabalipuram coast. 
 
 Tour operator C Kothandabani said, “Tourists, particularly foreigners, put up at resorts in Devaneri take walks along the shore early morning. They were horrified at the sight of the dead turtles.” 
 
 “Turtles play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. It is a flagship species which reflects the health and wealth of the ocean the way tigers reflect the state of forests. When it comes to turtle conservation, we are fighting a losing battle,” said Dharini.
