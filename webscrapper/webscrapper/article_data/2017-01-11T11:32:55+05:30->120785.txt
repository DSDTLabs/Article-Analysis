Vadodara: The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested two more persons for sheltering history-sheeters Kalpesh alias Kachhiya Patel and Anil alias Anthony Gangwani who were on the run after killing a gangster   in October last year. 

 While Anthony stayed at Tarun Patel’s house in Alamgir village in Vadodara district, Kalpesh had stayed at Deepak Patel’s home in Navsari district in south Gujarat. “Deepak is Kalpesh’s sister’s husband and Tarun is his friend. They both helped him hide at their home when he and Anthony was absconding. We have arrested Tarun and Deepak and they will be produced before the court on Tuesday evening,” said DCB police inspector, M S Vaghela. 
 
 Kalpesh had stayed at Deepak’s house for a couple of days immediately after Harjani was killed. He then left for Bangalore and later stayed in Mumbai and Shirdi before visiting Deepak’s home again. The police is investigating if Deepak and Tarun helped Kalpesh in any other way. As his four-day remand got over, the crime branch produced Kalpesh before the court that sent him to judicial custody on Tuesday. 
 
 The cops had been looking for Kalpesh for last two-and-half months but he suddenly surrendered before the court on December 31. He had claimed that he was innocent and he was being implicated in Harjani murder case. Harjani was shot dead by two sharpshooters on the night of October 20 last year. 
 
 The police had said that Harjani lost his life due to enmity with his rivals as well as friends. Patel, Dave and Sindhi had planned and executed Harjani’s murder as he had been demanding extortion money from them.
