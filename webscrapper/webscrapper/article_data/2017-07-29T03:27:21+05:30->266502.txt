MUMBAI: Former chief minister and Congress leader   on Friday demanded that chief minister   remove housing minister   and initiate a probe into his sanctioning of an   at Tardeo’s  . Raising the issue in the assembly, Chavan also asked the CM to explain why Mehta mentioned his name while sanctioning the proposal.

 “This is a very serious matter. The CM needs to call for a probe. Until the probe is completed, the   should not be in this post,” said Chavan. “The CM stayed the proposal but he needs to explain why his name was on it,” he said, referring to the illegality exposed by TOI. The CM is yet to reply to Chavan in the assembly.
 
 TOI’s report on July 12 said Mehta had permitted an SRA proposal that allowed extra building rights granted to slum-dwellers at the MP Mill compound to be transferred to a scheme for project affected people, a move which goes against development control norms. The decision would generate additional building rights worth over Rs 500 crore for the developer,  .
 
 Mehta had sanctioned the proposal despite objections by the housing department, TOI’s report said. While clearing it, he said in writing Fadnavis was aware of it. After TOI’s queries the CM denied knowledge of the proposal and stayed the scheme.
 
 “The housing department had clearly said it was illegal. But with one signature, the developer gained building rights for free sale worth Rs 500 crore to Rs 800 crore,” Chavan said, raising the irregularity during a discussion on issues relating to urban development . 
 
 He also pointed out that in TOI’s report former SRA CEO   who cleared the proposal after Mehta’s clearance said permissions had been taken at the highest level. “We need to know who was backing the proposal,” Chavan said.
