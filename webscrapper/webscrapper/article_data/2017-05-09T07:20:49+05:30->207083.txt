NAGPUR: Akila Begum, allegedly involved in the trafficking of a woman to   for Rs two lakh, has been allowed to attend son’s marriage by   police. Though Akila was rounded up on Friday last week, the woman was let off by the police for reasons best known to them. This was despite the fact that Akila, her accomplice from Mumbai, Abdullah, and three members of family based at   in Saudi Arabia, were booked for  .

 Sakkardara police, which had already dragged the inquiry period for around 50 days before registering FIR even after being instructed by CP’s office in March, now are allowing the matter of international trafficking to suffer with their apathy. The victim was treated as a human slave in Saudi Arabia before managing to flee from the place. She had been repeatedly claiming before police about victimization of more women like her in Saudi Arabia after being sold off by Indian agents for hefty amounts.
 
 City police chief K Venkatesh said that the corrective measures would be undertaken in the case. “We have already identified a black sheep in Sakkardara police station against whom action would be initiated,” he said. 
 
 In the meantime, it was also learnt that Akila has claimed before police that she was ailing with some disease. She also got admitted at a hospital after the case was registered against her. Her meeting with a dreaded gangster at Sakkardara police station has also raised several eyebrows. Activists, who had raised the issue, are likely to meet the CP and visit the police station protesting against the lapses.
