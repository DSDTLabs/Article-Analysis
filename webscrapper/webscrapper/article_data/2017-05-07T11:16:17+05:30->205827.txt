KANPUR: One person died and three others fell sick after consuming illicit   at an outlet near   Shadi Nagar village under Merapur police station in   on Saturday. 

 After the news broke, angry villagers ransacked the liquor outlet near Pakhna railway station in the village and set it on fire.
 
 The incident brought back memories of a hooch tragedy in the neighbouring Etah district which had claimed 39 lives in July 2016.

 "The four had consumed liquor at a liquor outlet near Pakhna railway station. The body of Anand Rajput has been sent for postmortem examination to ascertain the cause of death. We are trying to arrest the culprits", said SP,  .
 
 Tension gripped the area after locals ransacked and set ablaze the country-made liquor shop from where the victims had allegedly purchased the liquor. 
 
 Soon after the death of Anand, the women and youth of the area ransacked the liquor outlet and smashed the liquor bottles forcing the staff to flee from the spot. The mob later set the shop on fire. 
 
 Heavy police force rushed to the spot and chased away the protesters while fire brigade doused the flames. 
 
 The villagers have accused the police for being hand in glove with liquor traders, who sell spurious liquor. They threatened to intensify their stir if the police failed to take action against the liquor outlet owner.
