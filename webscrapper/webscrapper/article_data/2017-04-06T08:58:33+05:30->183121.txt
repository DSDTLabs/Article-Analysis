PATNA: Chief minister   on Wednesday asked   to   to monitor the quality of   works in the state.

 Sources said the CM accepted the drone proposal made by rural works department secretary Vinay Kumar at a review meeting of the department on Wednesday.
 
 Sources said the CM was informed by the officials that drones were being used in some western countries to monitor the road constriction works. While emphasizing on quality of roads, the CM asked the officials to further explore the possibility of using drones for the purpose.
 
 The rural works department would, however, need to take approval at various levels because a licence by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is required to use drones.
 
 “Drone is considered a live aircraft. Thus, permission is required to be taken from competent authorities, including the DGCA and the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The operator is required to submit the flight plan, including the area and the height to which the drone would fly,” said a senior Patna airport official.
 
 Sources said prior police approval is also required to operate a drone.
 
 The CM asked the officials to categorize rural settlements on the basis of population so that roads are constructed in all the settlements having a population of 100-249 people. The roads in rural settlements having a population of 100-249 are being constructed in the state under Gram Tola Sampark Yojana.
 
 The CM also reviewed the ongoing projects under various schemes, including Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and Mukhya Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. Nitish asked the officials to bundle rural road construction projects and   tenders for them. He also asked the officials to ensure that reservation policies are followed in the bidding process.
 
 According to sources, the CM is of the opinion that development of roads in rural areas would boost the economy and create job opportunities for youths.
