NEW DELHI: Shortly after addressing an explosive press conference on Friday after quickly completing their judicial work, three of the four   judges left Delhi.

 
 Justice J Chelameswar remained stationed in the capital but Justice   went to Kolkata. Justice   went to Jabalpur while Justice   went to Kochi.
 
 After the press conference, a journalist asked the four whether they would be able to sit together in future with CJI   for collegium meetings to select judges for the SC and HCs. The four nonchalantly said there would be no difficulty in sitting with the CJI for collegium meetings.
