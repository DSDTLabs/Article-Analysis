 Towards the end, Tim and Boss Baby remain close friends even as Boss Baby goes on to take up a corporate career.
 
 "I can't even remember who came up with that (climax). We're just trying to tell the best story with the characters. It's in no way meant to be a twist or for a sequel. The producers just had a little fun at the end," says McCullers. 
 
 He adds it will be great to have a sequel to the film but nothing is in works as of now. 
 
 "If there were to be a sequel, I would be very happy. We haven't talked about it at all - that's more of a finger-crossed kind of thing. We didn't think about making this a franchise-able thing," says McCullers.
