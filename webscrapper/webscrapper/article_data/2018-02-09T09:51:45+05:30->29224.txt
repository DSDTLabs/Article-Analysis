VADODARA: Facing objections over the alignment of two flyovers planned in the city, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will get fresh traffic surveys done at these junctions. The flyovers have been in the pipeline for quite some time but work on them is yet to take off.

 The civic body was planning to make flyovers at the Sangam Crossroads in Harni area of the city and the   in the Makarpura area of the city since the past couple of years after a report by the   (CRRI) of 16 traffic junctions in the city in 2013.
 
 The VMC got a fresh   done for the Sussen Crossroads flyover in April 2017 by a consultant. While the 2013 CRRI survey had given the alignment of the flyover from Makarpura to Pratapnagar, the 2017 study had suggested that it should be aligned from   to Tarsali.
 
 VMC officials said that a railway overbridge was constructed at Soma Talav after 2013 and this had changed the traffic flow at the Sussen Crossroads too. This may have led to the 2017 study suggesting that the alignment should be changed. The local residents in Sussen-Tarsali area too objected to the new alignment of the flyover. So, the VMC decided to conduct a new study done by CRRI again.
 
 At Sangam Crossroads, differences of opinion had emerged within the VMC regarding the alignment of the flyover. In this case too it was decided to have a fresh study done by the CRRI.
 
 The VMC administration has put up a proposal before the standing committee of the civic body regarding the need of fresh surveys at the two crossroads. The CRRI has sought a fees of Rs 9.91lakh for the study.
