MUMBAI: City collector   and her suburban counterpart   were among the 28 bureaucrats shifted on Monday. Jalna collector S R Jondhale will replace Mehta, Nagpur collector Sachin Kurve will be the new suburban collector. Shekhar Channe will be the new transport commissioner. 

 Channe was the secretary of the state election commission and will continue to hold that post. The biggest challenge before Channe will be to streamline the transport commissionerate, which has "almost collapsed" after Mahesh Zagade was shifted. 
 
 Mehta will be new commissioner (marketing), while Kushwah has been transferred to the sales tax department as joint commissioner. Buldhana collector C L Pulkundwar will be the new joint managing director, MSRDC; Pune collector Saurabh Rao will be the Pune civic chief. Education commissioner Vipin Sharma will be the new director general of the Maharashtra Energy Development, Vishal Solanki will replace him. Thane additional municipal commissioner Sunil Chavan will the new Aurangabad collector.   spokesperson Sachin Sawant has criticised the frequent transfers of bureaucrats.
