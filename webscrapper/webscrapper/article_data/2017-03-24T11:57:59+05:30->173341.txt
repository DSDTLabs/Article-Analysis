VADODARA: A 26-year-old woman staying in Alkapuri was allegedly molested by a   ( ) head constable when she was on her way home on Thursday evening. The incident occurred when the girl was climbing the stairs of the foot-over-bridge leading to the railway station’s platform number one. 

 “I was climbing stairs to go to the other side of the railway station at 7.50 pm. I was on the phone when this man came from the opposite side. Before I could realize, he molested me. I turned around and caught hold of him only to realize that he was in police uniform,” the girl told TOI. “I began shouting at him and tried to take a photo of nameplate on his uniform. He resisted my attempts but I managed to take a photo of his nameplate. Some people gathered around but no one did anything as he was in uniform,” she said. 
 
 “I went to the GRP   and informed the cops about it. They told me that the cop against whom I am complaining is posted in Godhra and is mentally unstable. If his mental condition is not good then why was he still in uniform? The way I was given replies at the police station, I wasn’t hopeful of any action. So I didn’t file any complaint,” she added. 
 
 The girl narrated the entire incident on her Facebook account and also kept photo of the cop’s nameplate. “The girl can approach me on Friday with complaint. I will act on her complaint,” said western railway SP, Sharad Singhal. The girl said that she will meet Singhal on Saturday due to professional commitments.
