LUCKNOW : Child welfare police officers in city police stations will now be clad in 'royal blue' shirts to interrogate and rescue children. The special first-of-its-kind dress was distributed to all the 43 cops in association with an NGO 'Save the children' and special police juvenile unit (SPJU) at an orientation workshop on Wednesday. 

 ADG ( )   distributed the new uniforms to cops and also said that he will ask the SPJU under SP (rural) to prepare a database of gangs which force street children into the world of crime. Police will also hunt and look for the status of those caught in the past for forcing street children into crime.
 
 Project coordinator, advocacy (Save the children)   said that the move of providing the dress was initiated so that children rescued/interrogated get a feel of friendliness. 
 
 She also said that from the second week of April they will start a drive to get homeless children enrolled under Aadhaar.
