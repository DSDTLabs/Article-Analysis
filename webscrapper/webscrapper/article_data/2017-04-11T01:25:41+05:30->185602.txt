NEW DELHI: It was Bollywood that fired Mainpuri (UP) resident Rajiv Kumar’s imagination to make a quick buck. 

 The plot of a movie inspired the 45-year-old to assume the identity of Jalim Singh Yadav of Etah using forged papers and shift to Delhi to work with a cash replenishment firm. Here, he convinced a colleague to keep him posted about cash transfers and amounts in store. It took Kumar five months to finally go for the kill. 
 
 On March 30, a company   went about its daily business of collecting cash. Around 7pm, the van reached the office of an e-commerce firm. “The driver Sahil Khan and the cashier went inside to collect cash. When they came out after 10 minutes, they found the van missing along with gunman Jalim Singh. The van had Rs 32.5 lakh,” said DCP M N Tiwari. 
 
 Kumar had driven away with the money. The plan was working as per the film plot until that point. But then, reality struck. 
 
 A police team was formed with inspectors K B Jha, Yashveer Singh and Manav Krishna and they got hot on his tail even as his partner, Mukund Singh, left for his hometown in Campawat (Uttarakhand) to share the loot with his uncles who live in Nepal. Before fleeing, however, Kumar had abandoned the van, an Eeco, near the Paschim Vihar Metro station. 
 
 Meanwhile, based on Kumar’s employment details, a police team landed in Etah, only to find that the address was fake. Then somebody tipped off the police about Kumar’s real address being in Mainpuri.
 
 Using electronic surveillance, police zeroed in on Kumar and arrested him. Around Rs 25 lakh was found on him, and a TV bought with the looted money was seized too. Kumar led the police to Singh who was arrested too.
 
 Kumar has four children while Singh has a daughter.
