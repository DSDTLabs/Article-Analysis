Actor  , who was last seen as Lord Shiva on ' ', has now been roped in for the TV show 'Mere Sai'. He will play Ratnakar, an   businessman.   says, “I am a staunch devotee of Sai Baba. I was going through a rough patch some years ago. At that time, I read about Baba and his philosophy of shraddha (faith) and saburi (patience). I have been following that since and my life has changed for the better. So, in a way, it’s an honour to be a part of this project. Besides, this show also allows me to break out of the mythological mould.”

 His journey in the mythological genre began with 'Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev', where he was seen as Ravana. “I am the only actor who has played both Ravana and Shiva. I don’t know what makes people select me for these shows. It could be because of my good command over Hindi and athletic physique,” he says, adding, “My reason for taking up mythological shows is that they are made with intelligence and conviction. Daily soaps, on the other hand, are mostly regressive and boring; something that I will not watch myself. If something interesting comes my way, I would love to associate myself with it.”
