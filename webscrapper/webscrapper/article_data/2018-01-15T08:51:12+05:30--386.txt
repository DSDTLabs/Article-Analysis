PUNE: More than 150 passengers travelling on a GoAir flight from Pune to Nagpur on Sunday had to put up with an eight-hour flight delay.

 The flight (G8-283) was to take off from Pune at 7.40am and reach Nagpur by 8.50am. However, it arrived from Bengaluru at 3.30pm and reached Nagpur at 5pm.
 
 Ashish  , a member of the city   unit, was among the passengers. “I reached the airport around 5.30am and after collecting my boarding pass, I was informed that the flight is delayed and will arrive only by 8.20am. The airline staff advised me to go home and said I would be alerted accordingly. Once home, I got a message stating that the flight has been delayed further and will depart at 10.55am. I reached the airport but the flight was delayed further. Different airline officials gave different reasons including fog and that the flight has a technical glitch,” he said.
 
 In a statement issued late in the evening, a spokesperson for GoAir, said, “The flight was delayed due to bad weather in Bengaluru coupled with technical reasons and Notam ( notice to airmen) in Pune. All passengers were provided snacks and lunch and were provided alternate travel options and a full refund. GoAir sincerely regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers,” the statement issued by the company read. 
 
 Flyers, however, were angry. “The flight was full with children and old people. Until 1.30pm, no one asked us for water. When some passengers demanded it, the staff told them to use the departure area facility. With the flight delayed, many started shouting and sloganeering. This forced the airline staff to give water to all passengers and refreshments came much later. At one point, we were told that the flight had taken off but had to land again in Bengaluru due to some technical issues,” Merkhed said.
