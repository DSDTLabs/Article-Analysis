Ever since   revealed that he is gearing up to play Bhima in the movie version of M T Vasudevan Nair’s  , speculations have been rife that some of the big names in Bollywood, such as   and Aishwarya Rai will also be part of the project. The film’s director Sreekumar confirms to us that Big B will indeed play the character of Bhishma in the movie.

 “Yes, he is the Bhishma of Randamoozham. We aren’t taking any cinematic liberties with the character for the movie, he will be playing the role as it is in the book,” says the filmmaker. Sreekumar though denies that Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan is part of the film. “We are still working on finalising the rest of the cast,” he says. Amitabh Bachchan had previously acted in Malayalam in the Mohanlal-starrer, Kandahar. 
 
 Recently, Peter Hein, who is also part of the film, had said that its stunts will be on par with that of Rajamouli’s magnum opus Baahubali. Randamoozham will be released in two parts and will reportedly have a whopping budget.
