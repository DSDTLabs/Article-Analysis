ZIRAKPUR: The management of solid waste in this town is a civic problem that the civic authorities have abandoned to the people. The   trucks engaged in lifting garbage don’t cover the housing societies.

 Resident welfare associations (RWAs) have another complaint. “The sanitation workers refuse to pick up the pruned tree waste, saying official orders forbid them,” BS Garg of Nirmal Chhaya apartments said. Municipal Council president   denied giving any guideline of this sort to the sanitation workers. “I will look into the matter and resolve the problem,” he said.
 
 Irregular emptying of dustbins creates a stinking situation every monsoon. Lucky officials! They don’t have to pass by these overflowing bins. Illegal occupants of farmlands beside the housing societies dump garbage over the sites, and add to the mess. Sanjeev K Bansal of   said: “Slum dwellers need to be evicted from the public land they have encroached upon. It is they who litter the residential areas with garbage and make life difficult for many families.”
 
 Local legislator   assured the residents of proper lifting of garbage: “I will meet the residents and RWA presidents to gather ideas for door-to-door collection of waste and then get the sanitation workers into action to implement those suggestions,” he said. “A private agency has been hired to pick up garbage for Rs 600 from each household of the town and dispose it. This will give Zirakpur a proper sanitation system.”
