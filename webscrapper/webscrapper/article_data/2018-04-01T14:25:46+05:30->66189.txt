As offbeat as it may sound, but the show started with drones flying all over the ramp, carrying some really bright and beautiful hand bags by luxury handbags and shoe brand  . The collection showcased by the brand on ramp had gorgeous bags of all kinds, ranging from clutches and totes to backpacks and slings. 

 The shoes looked classy and elegant and were a fine blend of sandals and pumps. White and beige seemed to dominate the foot wear collection. The flats had studs and a tinge of embellished work on them, making the entire range a perfect fit for both evening outings and lunch dates with friends on a sunny afternoon.
 
 Former beauty queen and actress   set the stage on fire wearing a pristine white dress. Talking about Ceriz's wide range of bags, Urvashi said, “What I really liked about Ceriz is that it is fun, glamorous and very effortless.”
