Speaking to TOI, Kadam said he had invited all hostel presidents and four JNUSU members for a meeting to discuss the hike in fee and fines. “We had a two-hour discussion in which the students raised those issues. JNUSU demanded that the hike should be reversed but I told them that the varsity has to follow some procedures before they take any decision. I informed them that I had come out with a notification to look into the hike...however, the JNUSU president and vice-president realised that I won’t change my mind so they called some students and refused to let me leave my office”.
 
 A video released by JNU showed a tussle happening between students and security officials outside the dean’s office. Kadam alleged the students blocked the entrance to his office with a sofa. However, JNUSU denied the charge. “The students had not blocked his way...they only wanted him to give his assurance that he will set up a committee to look into the hike,” said Simone Zoya Khan, JNUSU vice-president.
