Hopefully, the CBSE will allow private agencies to carry out the audit.”
 
 Schools have also been asked to ensure that police verification and psychometric evaluation is done for all staff members. The circular stresses that for non-teaching staff, police verification and evaluation is to be done very carefully and in a detailed manner.
