PATIALA: Attempts to make the state power surplus have put the   ( ) under a debt of Rs 29,306 crore, making the public entity in dire need of an efficacious plan to improve its financial position.

 Data assessed by the TOI reveals that the PSPCL has almost seen its debt move up from Rs 17,714 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 29,306 in 2015-16. The figures for 2016-17 financial year are not yet available.
 
 Sources in PSPCL said farm subsidies, fixed charges being paid to private power generators, failure to check power theft in VVIP districts under the   and no tariff hikes in the last two years are some of the key reasons for the failing financial health of the corporation. 
 
 Documents further revealed that there was a Rs 17,117-crore gap between the revenue expenditure and income of the PSPCL over the last three years, which was aggravated by no hike in power tariffs in two years. The annual revenue gap for 2012-13 was Rs 1,090 crore, which crossed Rs 5,141 crore mark in 2016-17. Besides, additional financial liabilities are mounting on the PSPCL, which now is paying interest charges of Rs 3,030 crore a year.
 
 The PSPCL went on to bag performance awards by claiming profits of ₨ 260.55 crore, Rs 249.30 crore and Rs 165.91 crore in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively. However, it reported a loss of ₨ 1,690 crore during 2015-16.
 
 All India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF) patron Padamjit Singh alleged that besides various subsidies and no tariff hikes, major losses had been caused to the PSPCL due to political patronage to power theft in some of the VVIP districts of the state, where the project to shift power meters outside premises had not been taken up in a missionary way. He alleged that the private thermal power plants set up in Punjab were also causing huge financial losses to the PSPCL with the signed MoUs mandating payment of fixed charges of Rs 1,800 crore a year to private companies.
 
 Aware of the financial ill-health of the PSPCL, chief minister Captain   said the   government would review the projects and the MoUs signed with the private companies.
