NEW DELHI: In what could spell fresh trouble for the proposed Teesta water sharing pact between India and Bangladesh,   CM and Trinamool Congress chief   pointed out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday the problems the state faces for sharing river waters with the neighbouring country. 

 Mamata’s meeting with the PM was to discuss fund allocation and other issues faced by the state. She submitted a three-page memorandum which focussed on problems that Bengal faces because of Bangladesh. 
 
 She urged Modi to take up the issues with Dhaka. Mamata’s concerns over Bangladesh is a clear pointer that the CM is unlikely to agree to the pending Teesta water sharing treaty easily. 
 
 She had made her displeasure clear to Modi and visiting Bangladesh PM   recently, saying that the   in its present form was not acceptable to Bengal. 
 
 Mamata is learnt to have told the PM that “Bengal’s experience of sharing Ganga water with Bangladesh is not good, as water shortage at the Farakka barrage causes the NTPC-run thermal power plant to shut down occasionally and the two ports in the state are impacted adversely”. 
 
 She complained about reduced flow of water from rivers like Atrayee, Tangon and Punarbhaga that flow into Bengal from Bangladesh because of barrages and dams built by the other side and also about severe pollution from Bangladesh flowing into Bengal’s Churni river in Nadia district. 
 
 She also asked the PM to take up with Dhaka the issue of Malda mangoes on which Bangladesh has doubled the import duty. “They have stopped sending Hilsa and now they are imposing heavy duties on mangoes,” she said.
