SHIMLA: Issue of buses purchased by previous   regime under the   (JnNURM) echoed in Himachal Pradesh Assembly on Tuesday during the question hour with transport minister Gobind Singh   announced to present a white paper on the issue.   of BJP Rakesh Pathania had alleged irregularities in the purchase of these buses.

 While raising questions on the technical specifications of buses bought during Congress regime, Thakur said that it was a matter of investigation how these buses were purchased despite the department having technical experts.
 
 He said that buses purchased were not suitable to the geographical conditions of state. He said that 12 meters long buses were purchased which were not required in the hill state and later 9 meters long buses were bought. He said that long buses and low floor buses were not suitable to the conditions of the roads in the state.
 
  leader Mukesh Agnihotri asked from the minister whether government was bearing losses for buses taken on wet lease. To this, Thakur replied that 92 super luxury buses were taken on wet lease and losses on the route were borne by the HRTC. He said that now condition would be imposed that losses would be shared by the HRTC and private entrepreneur providing the buses.
 
 Pathania said that low floor buses purchased by the Congress government were death traps. Thakur said that government will bring out a white paper on the issue. He said that HRTC had 42 Volvo buses but still 52 Volvo buses were taken on wet lease which was uncalled for. He said that either government had run its own buses or had taken buses on wet lease.
 
 He added that buses taken on wet lease were operated on the routes where HRTC was already operating its buses.
