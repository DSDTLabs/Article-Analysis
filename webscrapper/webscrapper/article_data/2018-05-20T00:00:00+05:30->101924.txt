After   had people eagerly waiting for his big announcement, he launched the first look poster of his film  , which is a   written by him and also features him in the lead role opposite  . We caught up with actor to know more about the project.

 Denying the speculation that this film is a remake of the Kannada film  , Balaji says, “A lot of people think this is a remake, but no, this film has been made with better political scenarios happening in Tamil Nadu. Moreover, the hero character in that film won’t suit mine. A lot of political satire films like Amaidipadai, Muhammad bin Tughluq, and Pudhumai Pithan have been inspiration for this film. A lot of research was done before making this real story… This is an original story.”
 
 Elaborating on the work that has gone into the script, he says, “It took us three months to meet all the political party cadres in Tamil Nadu, right from party workers to leaders. We would have watched at least 100 films based on politics to know what has been done in the past. We also read autobiographies of many political leaders and books written on leaders by their critics. So, there has been a lot of research behind this. Though a lot of films have inspired this story, this film will be relevant and will be based on the current political scenario, which can be understood by youngsters.”
 
 What motivated him to write this? “I feel liberated when I write. I wrote this over a period of two months. I was not that happy and satisfied with the kind of roles I was doing. So, I thought I should write something which is socially responsible. Since my strength is comedy, I have added humour to it. I also wanted to write something which people can relate to. This is real politics, not the ones which we see on TV or social media.”
