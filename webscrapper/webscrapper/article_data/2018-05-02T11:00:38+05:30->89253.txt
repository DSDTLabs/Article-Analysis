HYDERABAD:To provide better connectivity around the city and decongest roads, the state government will take up a 338-km Regional Ring   (RRR).

 The foundation stone for the road works will be laid by Union minister for road transport and highways   on May 5.
 
 The government has submitted a detailed project report ( ) to the Centre for the project, which will be executed under build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis. Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao, after inaugurating the 1.1-km Kandlakoya inter-change junction of Outer Ring Road (ORR) on Tuesday, said the new ring road will connect nearby towns to the city.
 
 KTR said 35 radial roads have been proposed for improved connectivity between 100-km inner ring road (IRR) and 158-km ORR. Of them, 19 have been completed, five roads are in stages of completion and work on the balance 11 roads will begin soon. With the inauguration of Kandlakoya junction, the entire 158-km ORR is fully operational.
 
 “HMDA will set up trauma care centres in all the 10 interchange points on ORR along with a command and control system,” he said.
 
 HMDA would take up one or two townships along ORR; LED lighting on Gachibowli-Shamshabad stretch has already been completed at a cost of ?25 crore, LED lighting would be provided on the entire ORR, he added. HMDA will also take up works costing ?1,750 crore, including ?400-crore Balanagar flyover.
 
 “Two skyways from Jubilee bus station to Shamirpet and another from Patny to Suchitra were proposed, but the defence ministry is not handing over 100 acres of land for construction of skyways. We offered the ministry 600 acres near Shamirpet. Apart from the land, the defence ministry is asking ?30 crore a year towards compensation which is ridiculous,” the minister said.
 
 Minister P Mahender Reddy, Malkajgiri MP Malla Reddy, and commissioner, HMDA, T Chiranjeevulu were present.
