BENGALURU: Two days after TOI broke the story of how the   is building a skywalk on the spot where the ramp of a proposed steel bridge is to come up on T  , the civic body stopped the work on Monday. 

 Project officials wrote to the   the same day asking the latter to confirm whether it's planning to construct a ramp for the steel flyover on the same stretch.
 
  The skywalk was to come up between War Memorial and Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium; the civic body got a tree cut, and erected four pillars each on either side of the road for the skywalk on Friday. "The work has been temporarily halted. We have asked the BDA to confirm the position of the ramp or its plans pertaining to the steel flyover on this part of the Chowdiah Road. We will wait until they clarify their plans and send us their response," said B Prabhakar, executive engineer of BBMP, who's in charge of the skywalk project. 
 
 Earlier, BBMP officials related to the project had said that they knew the BDA had planned the steel flyover, and it could be relocated if the BDA asked them to do so.
 
  Prabhakar added that the skywalk was planned before the steel flyover was even mentioned by chief minister   in his 2014-15 budget. A Palike council meeting in February 2014 resolved to build the skywalk, just days ahead of the state budget. The work, however, did not commence for over a year because a few trees had to be axed for the purpose, and the corporation's tree committee was averse to the idea. TOI had, on February 4, reported about how the BBMP was going ahead with building the skywalk even though the BDA had put in the public domain the project details, including the blueprint and plan, of its proposed steel bridge. The work on steel bridge couldn't begin as the southern bench of the   stayed the same.
