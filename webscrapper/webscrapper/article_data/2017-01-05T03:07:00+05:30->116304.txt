Panaji: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to address two public rallies in Goa in the run-up to the February 4 polls. “BJP’s national president Amit Shah, Union home minister Rajnath Singh and Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari will also be addressing public meetings in Goa,” said state BJP president Vinay Tendulkar. He told TOI that plans are afoot to invite the prime minister for two rallies. One rally will be held in North Goa and the other in South Goa. “This is our plan. Confirmation is awaited,” he added. Shah, Tendulkar said, will announce the candidates publicly at a meeting to be held soon. Tendulkar agreed that the BJP has an advantage as rivals will not get much time to campaign. “We have had Vijay Sankalp rallies across the state (in November–December) where we got a very good response. We are fully prepared,” he said. Tendulkar further said that in almost all the constituencies, except a few, candidates are virtually finalized and announcement is awaited. BJP has announced that they will contest 37 seats. “We started early and we are strong at the grassroot level. People are happy with the performance of the government since 2012. We’ve tried to give our best. Our schemes are very popular. Besides, we have put up infrastructural facilities, while some will be ready in the next one year or so,” he said, expressing confidence that the electorate will repose its faith in BJP again. As for the Congress, its national president Sonia Gandhi will be the star campaigner during the poll campaign. Sources said that the party’s election managers are also keen to get vice-president of the party, Rahul Gandhi, to address public meetings during the campaign. Some former Union ministers are also likely to be roped in by the party.
