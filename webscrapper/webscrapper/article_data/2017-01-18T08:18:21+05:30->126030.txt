 Police are yet to arrest the main suspect, Rajesh Kamble and his wife Vidya. "The Kambles are still at large. A lookout notice has been issued at international airports across the country for Kamble, who has been out of India since February 2016," Kumbhar said.
 
 Prabhudesai and Shah were produced before a court on Tuesday and have been remanded in police custody till January 23. 
 
 Kumbhar said the Kambles set up the unregistered firm with their associates, Prabhudesai and Shah. The firm allegedly lured depositors, promising them returns at 5% per month, or 60% per annum. Between 2009 and 2016, the firm collected Rs 7.74 crore from about 250 depositors. When it failed to deliver on the promise, a depositor lodged a complaint against them in July 2016 with the Kondhwa police station, he added.
 
 Kumbhar appealed to the people, who have been duped by the firm, to come forward and approach the economic offences wing near Sangam bridge in Shivajinagar.
