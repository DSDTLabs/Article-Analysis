NEW DELHI: Owners of   showrooms have approached the Delhi Police commissioner seeking a probe into almost 24 cases of burglaries in their shops by a gang that travels in a white Toyota Innova. The thefts had been reported by TOI on Thursday.

 The gang had struck in the same locality thrice in the past two months using a similar modus operandi. The electronics goods owners association has now threatened to hold a   if the burglars are not arrested.
 
 The victims said that the gang of 4-5 men strikes between 1am and 3am. The Innova is parked in front of the gate of the shop and stolen goods are loaded in the boot. Cops are trying to find out where the goods are sold.
 
 Last November, the gang had targeted a shop in Model Town-II and decamped with goods in a similar way. The shop owner,  , had then taken the matter to the police headquarters.
 
 “We have asked shop owners to register with the association and report such matters. We have submitted a list of incidents to the police commissioner for action. We have asked him to transfer the probe to the crime branch,” said Batra.
 
 An initial probe suggests that the Innova may have been stolen from outside Delhi. The numberplate is usually covered with a cloth. The role of criminals from UP is being investigated.
 
 Following a burglary in Mayur Vihar last month, cops launched a search for suspicious white Innovas around markets in the city. “The gang seemed well-informed about the exact place where the products were stored. They entered with torches and breaking equipment and took time to choose the products,” said Sushil Kumar, the owner of the electronics showroom in Mayur Vihar that was burgled last month.
