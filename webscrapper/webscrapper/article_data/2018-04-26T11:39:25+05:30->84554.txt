CALANGUTE: In complete violation of CRZ norms, an alleged illegal construction is coming up at the Orda jetty in Candolim, causing destruction to both, the mangroves and the marine life in the water body.

 Many of those living along the banks of the Sinquerim river are involved in fishing and use the jetty to park their boats and store their fishing nets. These local fishermen now fear that this construction coming up so close to the jetty could lead to destruction to the marine life which would in turn, hamper their traditional fishing business. They have also questioned as to how permission has been granted for a structure to be built so close to the jetty.
 
 When TOI visited the site, it was noticed that huge concrete pillars have already come up at the jetty and heaps of construction material has also been dumped at the site.
 
 Reiterating that the ongoing work at the jetty violated CRZ norms, Candolim local Damial Tellis said, “This illegal structure coming up near the Orda jetty, which is the property of the Captain of Ports, needs to be probed thoroughly as ascertain whether the license or NOC has been granted by the captain of ports for the work or whether the   authority has given its approval for the project.”
 
 When TOI tried to contact captain of ports James Braganza, he was unavailable for comment.
