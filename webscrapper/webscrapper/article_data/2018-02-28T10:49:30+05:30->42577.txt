PUNE: A PMPML bus   sustained serious injuries after two autorickshaw drivers beat him up with sticks at around 8 am on the Katraj-Kondhwa bypass. The autorickshaw drivers were upset because the   had grazed one of their vehicles. Incidentally, the bus was full of passengers at the time.

 The Katraj-Hadapsar bus had left the Katraj bus stand and was on its way to   when it stopped at a bus stand. When the PMPML driver pulled the handbrake, the bus rolled back a bit and hit one of the autorickshaws behind it. This enraged the autorickshaw driver and his accomplice, who then picked up a fight with the bus driver.
 
 The Bharati Vidyapeeth police’s assistant inspector Bholenath Ahiwale said on Tuesday, “They abused the driver — 36-year-old Pradip Madane, from Balajinagar at Dhankawdi — using foul language and damaged the windowpanes of the bus. Then they attacked Madane with sticks causing serious injuries to his hand,” said Bholenath Ahiwale, Bharati Vidyapeeth police’s assistant inspector.
 
 “On receiving information about the incident, we rushed to the spot. As Madane’s hand was injured, he was unable to drive. The passengers too were forced to wait. We then requested the Katraj bus depot authorities to depute another driver. The bus left for its destination after the new driver reached the spot.”
 
 “We have booked the autorickshaw drivers for obstructing the bus driver from performing his duty and causing grievous hurt, among other charges of the Indian Penal Code. The suspects have not filed counter-complaint,” he added.
