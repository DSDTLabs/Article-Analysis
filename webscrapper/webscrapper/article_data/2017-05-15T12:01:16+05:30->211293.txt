INDORE: A surge in the cost of production and increased competition from   has hit regional   industries. The demand for garments from overseas markets have dropped due to non-competitive prices and a surge in competition from rival competitors.

 Fluctuations in cotton prices and poor quality cotton in the region has also made trade difficult for textile mills. Industry experts said despite a drop in cotton prices, textile mills don’t benefit.
 
 Suresh Maheshwari, owner of a textile mill said, “The textile market is in a depressive state. We are not competitive at an international level because countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan offer garments at cheaper rates.”
 
 Experts said, benefits given by governments in rival countries such as subsidies and economic power supply has made their products popular in the global market.
 
 Industrialists said rising power costs, higher minimum wages and sluggish demand for garments from overseas buyers has dampened the market sentiment. “Strong Indian currency has also affected sales of textile mills in the country,” Maheshwari added.
 
 MC Rawat, secretary,   said, “Textile industries in the region are reeling under the high pressure of increased labour wages and power costs making their products expensive against rival countries.”
 
 A section of industries said the lack of clarity on GST has also hurt business in the region.
 
 Industrialists said textile mills hesitate to build up stock and conduct business hand to mouth because they lack knowledge about tax slabs under GST.
 
 The state government is revising its textile policy and coming up with a garment policy.
