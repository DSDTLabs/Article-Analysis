Director Meghna Gulzar’s spy thriller ‘Raazi’ starring the versatile   and   has been maintaining a rock-solid position at the box-office. The   and Dharma Productions’ film collected Rs 5.90 crore on its third weekday on Wednesday taking its total up to Rs 51.24 crore.

 Set in the India of 1971 and over the backdrop of the period leading of India Pakistan war in the same year, the film covered all sensibilities of that era. Speaking about the same, filmmaker   had said, “Sensibilities are very different from what we know today. Even the patriotism as it is in the film is very different from what we know of patriotism today. And that is where the magic of cinema comes in where we all come together and create that world, pull you into it and convince you that now you are in this world too. All the departments of the film pull together to make that world a reality and that is exactly what shows in the film.”
 
  
  
 While Kashmir has been one of the most favourite places of the filmmakers in Bollywood to shoot, the unrest in the valley of late has lessened the influx of B-towners in the state. When asked if the team ‘Raazi’ faced any sort of issues while shooting, Alia Bhatt said, “The place where we faced issues was Patiala and not Kashmir. Because of the Godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim, there was a strike and that is why we faced some issues. Contrary to what people believe, Kashmir is very safe, it is still beautiful and it is still warm.”
 
 Expressing her disappointment over the views of the people outside Kashmir about the place, Meghna added, “It hurts when the locals apologetically ask you that ma’am you guys have come here, do you feel something wrong here? Are you feeling afraid? Are you feeling safe? Why should any citizen of their country ask this about their home? It is not right.”
 
 The film is produced by Vineet Jain,  , Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
