 Ed Sheeran may be a chart-topping artiste but he rather wants to be remembered as a person he is in his personal life.
 
  
  
 The 25-year-old singing sensation, who is in a relationship with former school friend Cherry Seaborn, has said that his career and his professional achievements do not define him as a person.
 
 "As the brand guy, I am a musician. But it doesn't define me as a person. I want to be remembered for being a good dad and raising my children well," he said.
 
 Sheeran recently said that he is 'ready' to have children. When asked if he is excited to become a dad in the future, he said, "Massively, yeah. I wanted to be a dad, like, last year. I'm ready, let's go - tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around."
