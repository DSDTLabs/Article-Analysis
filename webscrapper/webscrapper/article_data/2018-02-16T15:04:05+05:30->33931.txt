Visakhapatnam: From the initial demand of setting up a   bench in Vizag, the chorus has now shifted to setting up a High Court in port city. In this regard, Vizag Bar Association (VBA) has called for a general body meeting on Friday.

 All groups and associations of advocates are slated to participate in the meeting, where they will put forth their demand that Vizag is best suited for setting up the High Court given its 6,000-plus  , highest number of women advocates (800-plus) and six law colleges and institutes. The city also boasts of a number of big industries and Public Sector Units (PSUs).
 
 The general body meeting will be convened by the secretary of VBA, P Satya Saibaba, at the bar association hall. The resolutions passed in this meeting will be sent to the law ministry.
 
 Kuppili Muralidhar,   and president of  , said: “The state government is mainly concentrating on development in the capital region. Vizag has been sidelined when it came to the setting up the railway zone but the High Court must come up here. In big states like UP and MP, the High Courts are not located in the capital but in Allahabad and Jabbalpur, which are far from their respective capitals of Lucknow and Bhopal.” 
 
 “We have adequate land to house a High Court, we have so many law institutes and industries where settlement of industrial disputes become a necessity. No other district has 6,000 advocates, with almost 3,000 practising ones. Vizag is the ideal place for setting up of AP High Court. It would be easier for people from north coastal Andhra as they need not travel all the way to the capital region to attend hearings if the High Court is established here,” Muralidhar added.
 
 Around two weeks ago, the advocates in Rayalaseema had boycotted court duties demanding a High Court bench in Tirupati and lawyers’ organisations in Vizag had also sided with them.
