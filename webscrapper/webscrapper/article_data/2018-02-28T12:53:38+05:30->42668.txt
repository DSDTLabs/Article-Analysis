BETTIAH: Police are tight-lipped on Monday’s attack on a church pastor and about a dozen lay followers at the   bus stand. SP   said on Tuesday police are probing the issue from all angles and action will be taken accordingly.

  police station   confirmed that an   has been lodged against 100 unknown persons for the incident. “We are scanning video footages to identify the culprits,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, video footages of the incident that have allegedly gone viral show, among other disturbing images, a shot of an uniformed policeman raining a lathi blow on the hapless Christian priest. Admitting that he had not seen any such video clip or still photograph, the SP said, “Police may have used force to enforce law and order. The mob had to be controlled.”
 
 “People present took video shots of all of us and I was threatened with death,” pastor Joseph mentioned in his FIR wherein he also credits the police of saving him and his small group and taking him to hospital for treatment.
 
 While the injured priest was not available, pastor Paul at the Gems St Paul’s Church said here that Brother Joseph is undergoing treatment and pleaded ignorance on the identity of people involved in the attack. He however said, “Police also beat him (Joseph)….then only the mob left him. Brother has suffered internal injuries as police have beaten him up thrice.”
 
 It may be mentioned here that at least 20 people, including a Christian priest, were attacked by a mob of alleged right wingers, while they were on their way in a bus to attend a congregation in Bettiah on Monday.
 
 “We met the SHO. He has assured us protection and has also given his cell number to call him up anytime,” said the pastor.
