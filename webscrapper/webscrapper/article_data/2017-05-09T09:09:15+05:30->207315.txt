HYDERABAD: Alarmed over the   and other surgeries, the state government has now stepped in to take stock of the issue.It has now directed   to send monthly report on the   being performed by them.“We have written to all private hospitals to send the report on surgeries on  . 

 The compilation will begin from this month,“ said Dr C Laxma Reddy , state health minister. The commissioner, family welfare, will monitor the reports.
 
 Turns out, while the district medical and health officers (DMHO) are supposed to keep tabs on the number of deliveries and surgeries performed by hospitals, the norm isn't being followed for a long time now. It has fuelled the concerns of the government as the number of C section surgeries and unnecessary hysterectomies are on a ra pid rise.
 
  It is true of some other surgeries too, share sources as doctors in city's private superspecialty hospitals are often forced to meet the financial targets for certain specialties such as cardiology , orthopaedics and transplantation. “In fact doctors are given salary and incentives based on the revenue generated from a department,“ said a senior doctor adding, “That is why patients are often kept for longer periods of time in hospitals and put through unnecessary investigations and procedures.“
 
 Hyderabad has over 50 such private super-specialty facilities. While this practice, sources allege, is largely prevalent in private hospitals, the track record of government hospitals isn't too good either. “It is true that government hospitals get the most complicated cases. But the negligence rate is very high and material and drugs used for surgeries are of very poor quality . Hence, the government must also do some introspection,“ said K Vikas, a city-based activist.
