Ariyalur: A day after a Tasmac wine shop was vandalised at R S Mathur in Ariyalur, another one at Eechankadu in the district came under attack of local people here on Wednesday. A group of women from Eechankadu village broke open the wine shop and threw the liquor bottles kept inside on the road before breaking them. 

 The group came to the shop before it opened in the morning determined to ‘act’ after various forms of protests over the years failed to stop its functioning. 
 
 The police came to the spot and attempted to prevent them from breaking liquor bottles. But the group completed its task and warned of attacking again if the shop reopened. It was the second attack on wine shops in two days in Ariyalur. On Tuesday, villagers, particularly women, had vandalised the wine shop at RS Mathur after their demand to close the shop was turned down.
 
 In another incident, villagers pelted a wine shop functioning on a farm land at Palayapadi village in Ariyalur with stones on Wednesday after the police decided to arrest the protesters belonging to Kaaraipaakkam and Manjalmedu villages. 
 
 Tasmac had opened the wine shop here after closing a shop on Ariyalur – Thirumanur road as per Supreme Court order. People protested in front of the shop and demanded its closure. 
 
 The police attempted to arrest them but the protesters turned violent and threw stones at the shop. The protesters dispersed only after the officials promised not to open the shop here.
