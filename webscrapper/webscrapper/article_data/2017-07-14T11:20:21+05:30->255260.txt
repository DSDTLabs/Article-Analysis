PUNE: The   ( ) is eager to set up a   in  . A proposal for the same has already been sent to the state government. The organization runs various educational institutions in the state. 

 “A proposal was sent to the government by the end of November last year. The new university will be set up either in Navi Mumbai or Kalamboli. We have asked the government to allot us land. In case that does not happen, we will start the project as a private venture,” S K Jain, governing council president of SPM, said.
 
 SPM plans to affiliate its colleges to the deemed university once it takes off. “In the initial phase, we will affiliate our colleges. The affiliation will be done in phases obeying all government rules and regulations,” Jain added.
 
 A proposal to make SP College autonomous will be sent to the University Grants Commission. “The third round of NAAC assessment will be done and we are sure that we will be getting ‘A’ or ‘A+’ in it. As per   guidelines, if we get ‘A’ rating thrice consecutively, we will be eligible for autonomy,” Jain said.
 
 Jain further added that the deemed status will give the institutes more autonomy to include latest courses and also put in place a world-class infrastructure. “We will have better infrastructure. Hence, students will benefit from it,” Jain added.
