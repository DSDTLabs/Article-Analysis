MYSURU: Although they are ruling the state as coalition partners, the   and JD(S) appear not to have arrived at an understanding as far as the elections to the three vacant   seats are concerned. Candidates from both parties will be contesting the elections. Friday was the last day for withdrawal of nomination papers, and with candidates from neither party doing so, polls to the three seats have now turned into a triangular contest between the Congress, JD(S) and the BJP.

 Of the three seats – South Teachers’, Southwest Graduates’ and Southwest Teachers’ – the BJP currently holds two, and the JD(S) one. While eight candidates are contesting from Southwest Graduates’ constituency, nine are in the fray at South Teachers’ segment and 12 are in contention for the Southwest Teachers’ seat.
 
 Incumbent MLC for the South Teachers’ constituency, Marithibbe Gowda of the JD(S), who is seeking re-election, is up against M Lakshamana of the Congress and B Niranjanamurthy of the BJP. Meanwhile, the JD(S) has fielded SL Bhoje Gowda from the Southwest Teachers’ constituency, where he is pitted against KK Manjunath of the Congress and Captain Ganesh Karnik of the BJP.
 
 The battle for the Southwest Graduates’ constituency will see former MP Aayanur Manjunatha, contesting as a BJP candidate, locked in a battle against Aruna Kumar of the JD(S) and SP Dinesh from the Congress.
 
 The decision by both JD(S) and Congress to contest the council elections separately assumes greater significance in the run-up to the local body polls scheduled in Old Mysuru region, where both parties are dominant. It remains to be seen if the parties will arrive at an understanding for the local body elections.
