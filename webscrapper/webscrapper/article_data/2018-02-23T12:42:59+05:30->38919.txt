JAIPUR:   ordered the government to make the additional director in the medical and public health department to pay from his pocket the salary of three ANMs for the period of their relieving from their last posing and the new posting as the officer was responsible for not allowing them to join in their new posting.

 The single bench of Justice S P   gave the directions on a contempt petitions by ANMs Suman, Sumitra and Sumita. The trio were transferred   to Jalore district on September 15 last year. They approached the high court challenging their transfer and the court cancelled their transfer order December 10 last year. But additional director of public health (administration) Rakesh Sharma did not allow them to rejoin duty at Jhunjhunu.
 
 The petitioner then filed a contempt petition in the court against the department official. The court then asked who will pay the salary of the petitioners for the period they were not working as they were not allowed to join duty.
 
 The government counsel said it is upon the government to pay the salary. He said the petitioner are eligible for salary as it was not because to their fault that they could not join duty. But the court said why the public exchequer should bear the cost of the lapses of an official. Such officials had to face the consequences of their action and directed the government to deduct from his salary to pay for the ANMs for the period (December 17 to February 16 2018) they could not give their services.
