AHMEDABAD:   police on Thursday arrested one Bhavesh Rathod (35), a resident of Kubernagar, for stabbing   (45) in the neck on Monday night on the   Road. Police said Rathod was a spurned lover and used to harass Gaglani’s wife for quite some time.

 
 Police said due to Rathod’s harassment, the Gaglanis, who used to live in a joint family in Kubernagar, had changed their residence and shifted to Bangla Area.“Rathod held a grudge against Gaglani for shifting house with his wife and wanted to kill him,” said a police official of Sardarnagar police station.
 
  According to a complaint lodged by Gaglani’s elder brother Sunil, they own two hosiery shops — one in Kubernagar and another in   area. “The elder brother handles Kubernagar shop and the younger one looks after the Kagdapith shop,” a police source added.
 
 Last Monday while Ghanshyam was returning from his Kagdapith shop, a man on a bike intercepted his scooter on ITI Road and stabbed him in the neck. “The assailant escaped as locals rushed in to help Ghanshyam,” said a police official.
 
 Ghanshyam was shifted to a private hospital. “He had then failed to identify the accused. But had later said that they were forced to vacate their house in Kubernagar as a man Bhavesh Rathod, who used to stay in house opposite to them, used to harass his wife,” said a police official. Police brought Rathod, who works with a private company, for questioning. “We noticed an injury on his hand. Initially, he claimed that he sustained the injury while playing cricket. However, Rathod later broke down and confessed that he had committed the crime as he thought that Ghanshyam was responsible for changing the house,” said a senior police official.
